the way it is most all airdrops can be prevented just be creating an address with a small amount in it

[12-May-19 08:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems easy enough

[12-May-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the "attack" would be frequent airdrops of small amounts to make the smaller coins not get anything, but that can be prevented by making the minimum total airdrop big enough

[12-May-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is much better to skip

[13-May-19 06:17 AM] dimxy#2587
I added a test vout with some fixed address where 0.5% fee is sent.
Also I added a check that this vout  should have not less than 10000 sat.

[13-May-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[13-May-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the input amount can be any amount... Im still trying to work out how to enforce minimum pay out... IMO just wait until there is enough funds in it to release

[13-May-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to need to rewriere entire validation to acheive this condition...

[13-May-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy Is there mechanism already to set this fixed address?

[13-May-19 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why need fixed address, I already added the paymentsCC address mechanisim... Its nto very complicated. What we need is a minimum release somehow so small amounts of funds can be released. Doyou need help to set this up?

[13-May-19 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im thinking just some exemption maybe soi that smaller amounts can be released or something... Its simply not possible to shorten the list of address that is paid.

[13-May-19 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can truncate the tx, but the total allocation would still include all elegible address

[13-May-19 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So its not optimal at all.

[13-May-19 07:25 AM] dimxy#2587
well I just set it in the code as hex pubkey. Do we need it to be parametrized?

[13-May-19 07:27 AM] dimxy#2587
if we need some specific address - let's set it instead
@TonyL  This address is supposed just for testing. 
As we are ready to switch to a new chain I enable the code from blackjok which sends fee to the KOMODO_EARLYTXID_SCRIPTPUB

[13-May-19 07:45 AM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r  Are you saying that I do not need to check the amount on the vout for payment cc? So it could be any amount on it even small?

[13-May-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already added all this

[13-May-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The inputs can be merged.

[13-May-19 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the utputs that james has the issue with... I see only one simple solution, and I dont really think its very fair as such... although how liley will it be that under 10ksat is paid... if the plan has a sane minimum release it will be fine.

[13-May-19 07:47 AM] dimxy#2587
@blackjok3r I set the fixed address as it was suggested just for testing before switching to a new chain

[13-May-19 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I added all the stuff for new chain. I thaught one had been started. sorry not been avalible much last few days to keep up.

[13-May-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it simply takes a scriptpubkey, so for testing you arte hard coding a scriptpubkey that is fine, as long as what I added is actually working... as I didnt test it with a real chain because hte pricessCC wasnt finsihed for it at the time.

[13-May-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive fixed a few bugs with paymentsCC, and I guess I need to add this trunctation of the tx in the RPC... I assume this will work, although its not a very nice solution it should at least work.

[13-May-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy I'm not able to sync REKT0 with latest daemon from your repo 
At first sync stuck on 5841 with such prints in debug.log:
```2019-05-13 20:17:05 ERROR: CheckTransaction(): invalid script data for coinbase time lock
2019-05-13 20:17:05 AcceptBlock block from future error
```
Then tried to resync from scratch. But stuck earlier and was banned by all nodes:
```  "blocks": 3100,
  "longestchain": 3751,
  "timeoffset": 0,
  "tiptime": 1556116125,
  "connections": 0,
```

[13-May-19 08:29 PM] dimxy#2587
Ok, I'll also try this

[13-May-19 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
I think that before I was in consensus with only yours nodes

[13-May-19 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Before I stuck I've tried to generate `pricesbet` and `pricesaddfunds` transactions and both had 0.5% vout to the same address

[13-May-19 08:31 PM] TonyL#3577
So seems it work - not tested interesting cases yet like a txfee amount bet

[13-May-19 08:44 PM] dimxy#2587
I have disabled the costbasis funcid but such txns still exist, correcting...

[13-May-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
how will you fix it in a way that wont allow people to make costbasis funcid?

[13-May-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe for now a chain specific exemption?

[13-May-19 08:48 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes now I'm advancing the non-validating height for REKT0.
I suppose in a new chain we won't have such issue and txns will be stable

[13-May-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, good

[13-May-19 08:50 PM] dimxy#2587
updated the repo

[13-May-19 08:57 PM] TonyL#3577

Are you on same height?

[13-May-19 09:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like we made one more fork hehe, before there were 5800+ blocks

[13-May-19 09:04 PM] dimxy#2587
I im stuck at 3100 from costbasis,
in some other cases i saw pause and continue

[13-May-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, on latest I passed trough 3100

[13-May-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
But now longestchain is just 3700 blocks instead of 5800 before, thats why I asked on which height are you

[13-May-19 09:06 PM] dimxy#2587
now I am at 5853

Looks like I have to try until it sync 😃

[13-May-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's just connectivity issues to your node

[13-May-19 09:12 PM] dimxy#2587
I saw this several times while syncing

It pauses and continues on such errors.I did not do anything

Synced now 😃 just strange that one time it decided that longestchain is `3776` blocks

[13-May-19 09:15 PM] dimxy#2587
maybe this was from the ban

[13-May-19 09:23 PM] TonyL#3577
pricesbet: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/j3Rc8ppc5g/
pricesaddfunding: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9RZYyjzXSK/

Both have 0.5% output to RAvTXi4GRktCdudNsB2ocFLEyvyoWJ4ty6

Is this print:
```PricesValidate() ValidateAddFundingTx = false invalid position size in the opreturn
PricesValidate() funcId=A ValidatebetTx = false incorrect vout number for bet tx```
on pricesaddfunding broadcasting expected? @dimxy

[14-May-19 06:56 AM] dimxy#2587
This could be because as I added payment cc vout so some older bet tx could not be validated.
That is, when an addfunding tx is added I do step back and validate the initial bettx too
(because initial bet tx has no cc vin I think I should validate it this way, that is, after some new tx with cc vins like addfunding tx is added)

{Reactions}
👍 

[14-May-19 07:36 AM] dimxy#2587
actually now most of validation code just logs errors and returns true

[14-May-19 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
btw pricesbet not checking on amounts of digits in number. There is a check on pricesbet amount to be > than 0.1 but number like this do the trick: 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 0.10000000000000000000000000000001 1 "BTC_USD, 1"````

```

[14-May-19 07:51 AM] dimxy#2587
well I think such an issue may be in all rpcs where coins are passed. Maybe we should develop a common checking function which is this case could warn that number is truncated

[14-May-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I wonder any accuracy with order less than satoshi dont have sense because satoshi indivisible

[14-May-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy `As we are ready to switch to a new chain I enable the code from blackjok which sends fee to the KOMODO_EARLYTXID_SCRIPTPUB` - just to clarify - is this code active already if I'll start new chain with `earlytxid` param?

blackjok said he made some important corrections to payments cc which he push into jl777 branch.
prices cc actually in a branch from FSM branch. So seems I need to add them manually, 
studying his changes...

I am receiving many errors on my new prices chain:
"CheckTransaction(): invalid script data for coinbase time lock"
(maybe this is because I set ac_blocktime=60?)

[15-May-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I've started such chain:
```./komodod -ac_name=PRICEST -ac_cc=2 -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=1000000000 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_prices="LTC, BCHABC, XMR, IOTA, ZEC, WAVES, LSK, DCR, RVN, DASH, XEM, BTS, ICX, HOT, STEEM, ENJ, STRAT" -ac_stocks="AAPL, IBM, EA" -ac_snapshot=50 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237 -addnode=159.69.45.70 -pubkey=02147f20fbe0c3cc443cbded55a533bf2621a6efa0c089ac3b7a903f1d63f6690f -daemon
```
Then when I'm starting mining:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PRICEST setgenerate true 1``` daemon deadly hangs

[15-May-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Have modified PRICES_DAYWINDOW:
```-#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW ((3600*24/ASSETCHAINS_BLOCKTIME) + 1)
+#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW ((3600*1/ASSETCHAINS_BLOCKTIME) + 1)
```

[15-May-19 09:25 AM] dimxy#2587
what is your blocktime?

[15-May-19 09:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be default (1 min)

[15-May-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I expected window 61 (1 hour)

[15-May-19 09:27 AM] dimxy#2587
on REKT0 it was 600 (10min). I can see checks with 60sec constants - could be overlaps or so. I think I 'll recreate the chain with 120 or more

[15-May-19 09:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try now with default PRICES_DAYWINDOW

[15-May-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, found the reason - it not because of `PRICES_DAYWINDOW` but because of `ac_stocks` param

[15-May-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
With `-ac_stocks="AAPL, IBM, EA" ` daemon hangs right after I start mining, but without this param it works fine
