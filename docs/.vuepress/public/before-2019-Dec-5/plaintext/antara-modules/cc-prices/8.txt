that is what the code says

[19-Apr-19 09:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Things which we need so far:
1) Test mode with price lock after 3 blocks instead of 24 hours
2) Synthetic print in `pricesinfo`
3)  getprice rpc call where you can pass in a synthetic string and height and get price
4) "blocks_until_costbasis_lock" indicator in `pricesinfo`

[20-Apr-19 07:28 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  did you downloaded my last prices update (I corrected the costbasis calculation - seems  the prints above indicate there are no the last changes)?

[20-Apr-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy yes, costbasis in prints following last price

[20-Apr-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
always? it should be MAX of all prices during 24hrs

[20-Apr-19 09:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me track more carefully to see if it MAX or follow on declines

[20-Apr-19 09:37 AM] dimxy#2587
No, the last changes are probably there.
The issue with this call /komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesinfo 909291ca7715b14d502899012c8fe797230091deae3ae47c08626657f8a02ba7
was that the sample size was actually only 1 block == 2397. So obviously costbasis == lastprice in this case.
I can see the difference with the firstprice value. It is because firstprice is calculated differently from the costbasis and lastprice, with no minmax calculation, just the smoothed value.

Yep, it's definetly not a ` it should be MAX of all prices during 24hrs` atm

[20-Apr-19 10:13 AM] TonyL#3577

[20-Apr-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Atm `lastprice` and `costbasis` in this position not matching any of values from last prices

[20-Apr-19 10:22 AM] dimxy#2587
firstprice is the smoothed value from the firstheight block=2397
costbasis is the min (if lev < ) of correlated and smoothed  valuues from the period from firstheight till the height which is passed as pricesinfo param 
(and if its is omitted then lastblock) or 24h  - whatever first

[20-Apr-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if negative leverage, it is the MIN[]

[20-Apr-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Negative leverage bets profit if price is falling, positive leverage if rising

[20-Apr-19 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
So profits calculation should be different too for negative leverage (if it the same now)

[20-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
profits calc multiplies by leverage

[20-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it would have made money as a long trade, it loses as a short

[20-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Andersen#8337
Profit and loss in LONG and SHORT non linear in bitmex , due  all contracts  settlement in BTC .  And you can choose isolated margin or cross (all in).

At the moment `priceslist` returns list of all bets on chain what is not very useful. I think it will be great if there will be separation between pending and finished bets and also `mypriceslist` to get list of user bets (similar to rogue)

[21-Apr-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the short position profit looks reasonable, but maybe it is off by 1

[21-Apr-19 06:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, it's in satoshis, not coins

[21-Apr-19 06:11 AM] TonyL#3577
If in satoshis it might be fine

[21-Apr-19 06:16 AM] TonyL#3577
But I should be in loss in this short, not profit - last price is higher than both firstprice and cost basis

[21-Apr-19 06:17 AM] TonyL#3577
So not sure why it looks reasonable tbh

[21-Apr-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
If costbasis representing my position its less than 1% profit so shohld be not more than 100% profit with 100 leverage

[21-Apr-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry i meant the long position

[21-Apr-19 06:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Rekt on long looks reasonable yup

[21-Apr-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is down by about 1.2%, so it is indeed rekt and without any rekt miners it was able to live past its death. but for such positions, it would be able to be rekt using the first block that it was rekt and shouldnt be able to be cashed out

[21-Apr-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
however if it goes back into profit before someone rekts it, then i guess a cashout would be possible

[21-Apr-19 06:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so some "rektbot" scanner is needed

[21-Apr-19 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a anybody can initiate rekt for someone position if `rekt: 1` but only opener can initiate close not into rekt?

[21-Apr-19 06:34 AM] TonyL#3577
If needed I can start simple scanner which will check positions for "rekt 1" and close it

[21-Apr-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
only people that want to earn money from generating rekt transactions should be scanning

(I was not an overflow but incorrect cast of the operands to unsigned) - in my repo

[21-Apr-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
