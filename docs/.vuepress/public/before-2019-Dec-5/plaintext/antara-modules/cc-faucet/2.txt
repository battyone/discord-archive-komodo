if -pubkey has not been set it retunrs error

[27-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and takes NO arguments...

[27-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just retunrs yours

[27-Jan-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
It's debug call mostly as I understand so I guess it's useful for CC developers since there is such pubkey option

[27-Jan-19 11:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So is that understanding is correct that ALL CC will only work with the single `myCCaddress` which is generated using `-pubkey` param at the starting of daemon?

[27-Jan-19 11:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if need using different address, has to restart with different `-pubkey` ?

[27-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Jan-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
It should work like this since `myCCaddress` generating for `-pubkey`

[27-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
each pubkey generates dozens of related addresses, becomes unmanageable to have to juggle more than one pubkey

[27-Jan-19 11:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, so to make things not complex the session from daemon start to daemon stop only is restricted to use the address from that single `-pubkey` supplied to daemon.

[27-Jan-19 11:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or is there more reason to supply `-pubkey`? I mean what is the reason it is a daemon param and not an RPC command to activate/supply the `pubkey` to activate for the daemon?

[27-Jan-19 11:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I know @blackjok3r made an API, which is considered dangerous to use üòÑ

[27-Jan-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
`-pubkey` is your identification card / passport for the CCs usage world üòÉ

[27-Jan-19 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It can only set it once.. I have used it for many things though. The pool software I made uses it and so does the staking script. Hasnt been any issues.

[27-Jan-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
To cross the border with new passport you have to go out of country first

[27-Jan-19 11:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did not had the `-pubkey` set on startup of daemon

[27-Jan-19 11:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is my steps not correct?

[27-Jan-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It wont let you set it if it is set... Need backtrace

[27-Jan-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you just call it

[27-Jan-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing special

>It wont let you set it if it is set...
where ? I did not set it at daemon start. daemon started without `-pubkey`.
how do I debug on mac ?

[27-Jan-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
```gdb -args ./komodod ...```

[27-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the -pubkey is already set it *should* be returning an error. If it was not set it should retun a  address and the pubkey and isMine /true/false

[27-Jan-19 11:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`gdb` okay, let me try

[27-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should nto crash... seems a MAC thing maybe?

[27-Jan-19 11:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
possible

[27-Jan-19 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, it's not something urgent, installing gdb, if can do something about it anyway

For channels and heir pubkey is required to show 1of2 addresses, for others it is optional and just shows CC address of pubkey for thet CC contract

[28-Jan-19 02:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
I also added [CC]TokensAddress to show where Tokens are stored if used in CC. Not all CCs use tokens but they could get support in the future...

@Bryan_Beus Where will be main documentation for CC??

[28-Jan-19 05:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mihailo 

developers.komodoplatform.com is for newcomers to the Komodo ecosystem.

For now, it has only what a newcomer needs to get started, and nothing more.

docs.komodoplatform.com is where everything else goes. 

There's too much documentation for me to manage it all alone. I have other tasks that I'm responsible for, and I don't have that much bandwidth. 

So, docs.komodoplatform.com is just a bin for people who are accustomed to Komodo and don't need any hand holding.

[28-Jan-19 05:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mihailo 

If you add a new CC, I will need to put docs on it in developers.kp

[28-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Those are useful for newcomers.

[28-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Mihailo#5902

Please make yourself a branch in the github repo, add whatever you want, and ping me when you are ready.

Or, even better, do a PR, like you suggested for FSM branch.

Oh yes, just kidding - enlarging letters in tests now :)
Is `%CCNAME%marker` a `%CCNAME%NormalAddress` now?

[28-Jan-19 09:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
And you should parse text when comparing to all to lower or all to upper. That way your compare i case insesitive.

[28-Jan-19 09:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[28-Jan-19 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure if I get about parsing

[28-Jan-19 09:29 PM] TonyL#3577
I can pop `result` key and iterate over all others to not hardcode keys (this test checks that R addresses were generated for each field) if there is no risk to miss some 'key' and assume that only addresses will be stored in values (if keys are hardcoded test will detect it)

[29-Jan-19 05:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mihailo That's good to show CC name in key. But I think instead of bracket an undrrscore would be much better. ü§î

[29-Jan-19 07:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
I can do underscore, but I put brackets as it is just an optional descriptor...

[29-Jan-19 07:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL For parsing I meant whenever you are comparing some text somewhere it is good to do for example lower case for that text and then compare with lower case constant. This way you are avoiding difference in case. Unless it is case sensitive and there can be same text with different case.

[29-Jan-19 10:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes mate, I get it's just optional descriptor. But coding Js for sometime I feel `underscore` `_` will suit better for `JSON` key.

[29-Jan-19 10:23 AM] Mihailo#5902
@grewalsatinder Np, I'll change it in some next iteration

the output of `faucetinfo` gives result like this:
```{"result":{"result":"success","name":"Faucet","funding":"0.00000000"},"error":null,"id":"curltest"}```

[30-Jan-19 05:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The type of `funding` value is recognised as `string`

[30-Jan-19 05:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it should be `float`

[30-Jan-19 05:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mihailo

[30-Jan-19 05:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, I see the `faucetfund` method accepts value in `string` instead of `int` or `float`
