I know that Equaliser is working on getting rewards out

[11-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Who is coding those contracts?

[11-Dec-18 07:14 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptoon Rewards CC is one of the initial CC consensus modules (aka CC contracts) on Komodo platform developed by @jl777c

[11-Dec-18 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually all current working modules are developed by JL except of ChannelsCC which is a brilliant job of @Mihailo

[11-Dec-18 07:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahaa, was more asking who is editing the cc's for them

[11-Dec-18 07:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume it's not just plug and play and you still need a dev to code them?

[11-Dec-18 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
It depends of your needs - if current one is suits your needs you can just activate it on your asset chain and use it by RPC calls

[11-Dec-18 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
If you need some conceptual/consensus customisation - in this case source code rework needed

[11-Dec-18 07:23 PM] TonyL#3577
In general as a dAPP developer you can use CC module just as a magic box (you have  human readable RPC calls with predicted and expected outputs and may dont care mostly what going on on vins/vouts level)

Not sure tbh what Equaliser do â˜º

[12-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They want masternodes iirc

[12-Dec-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
why do they want masternodes? to actually add a second layer of priviledged nodes, or to just lock funds and get rewards?

[12-Dec-18 10:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the latter I think

[12-Dec-18 10:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
support price perhaps

[12-Dec-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
then rewards CC does what is needed

[27-Feb-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush plans to enable the rewards CC, please let me know if there are any consensus changes coming soon

[27-Feb-19 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto how would you fund rewards plans?

[27-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
I think rewards is solid, but I imagine any significant bugs that would be found would be hard forks. Hate to sound like a shill, but probably worth while to wait and run some incentivized tests with it on LABS. Either that or do some thorough testing of it yourself

[27-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
have you considered using two fungible momom chains?

[27-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
one that will hard fork as often as needed, one that will rarely hardfork

[28-Feb-19 08:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
given the above, maybe Rewards is just a nice-to-have for Hush, it's not our focus. haven't thought of multiple chains, the main reason Hush is becoming an AC is for sapling, so if any CC stuff makes it harder/more work, it will be left for a future upgrade

[26-Mar-19 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Found a pretty bad bug with rewards

[26-Mar-19 09:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure why its been done, but the recover funds is not working at all... if for any reason imputs are not found, and this could be for many reasons... Then its just returning the locked funds

[26-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It needs to actaully check all teh conditions are met before releasing this recover thing... IMO recover shouldnt be there... doesnt seem like it was designed to have it. Doesnt seem any simple fix.

[26-Mar-19 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems rewards would need a major redesign to fix this problem.

[26-Mar-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean? which tx, which case

[26-Mar-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at any time it cannot find inputs it just does the recover transaction. This means its skipping minseconds checks and many other things

[26-Mar-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant fix the validation properly...

[26-Mar-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because the RPC is wrong

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the recover transaction?

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean unlock?

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really understand why it is there

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
please be more specific and dont jump to conclusions

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems that if there are not enogh inputs to pay the reward, weather that be becasuse not locked long enough ... or they actually are not there  it will just send a recover tx.

[26-Mar-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
what line of code?

[26-Mar-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to at the very least make sure the minimum requirments are met before sending this tx, but the checks for these requirments are deeper inisde other  loops with no easy way of returning an error to stop this tx being sent

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is rpc level, so even if the code is changed, anybody could issue the same tx

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why I dont understand why there is a secondary validation for this... its skipping all teh requirement checks

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs to check all these first ... then bail out

[26-Mar-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not bail before its checked them

[26-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is just not adding the reward as a "better to recover the funds, than nothing at all"

[26-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
what line of code is skipping the validation?

[26-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not one line of code

[26-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its the whole thing

[26-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[26-Mar-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the fix i suggested was for the case where there are no rewards, that the destination address needs to sign a vin

[26-Mar-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`if ( (inputs= AddRewardsInputs(ignore,0,cp,mtx,rewardspk,reward+txfee,30,sbits,fundingtxid)) >= reward+txfee )`
`else`
```// This should be checking that minseconds has passed... looks like clear bug!
                    firstmtx.vout.push_back(CTxOut(amount-txfee,scriptPubKey));
                    //CCerror = "cant find enough rewards inputs";
                    fprintf(stderr,"not enough rewards funds to payout %.8f, recover mode tx\n",(double)(reward+txfee)/COIN);
                    return(FinalizeCCTx(-1LL,cp,firstmtx,mypk,txfee,EncodeRewardsOpRet('U',sbits,fundingtxid)));```

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, some random third party cant close out existing rewards

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it just needs to not be there ...

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt make a lot of sense

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the rewards calc is done above

[26-Mar-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if the reward was more than txfee, then and only then does it try this

[26-Mar-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if the rewards inputs are not therem then the rewards fund is depleted and it is reasonable to just recover the funds

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so in the recover case, add a normal vin and have the validation make sure the destination pubkey has a vin, not sure why you are freaking out over this

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no but it wont find any inputs if minseconds hasnt passed

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so then it sends the funds out.... when they are not allwoed to be released

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does that make sense?

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the rewards calc would be 0

[26-Mar-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt go into that if statement

[26-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the validation isnt checking it... I thaught this was what Alright was going on about how he was able to steal funds...

[26-Mar-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to add validation

[26-Mar-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
both need to check the same thing... this recover tx isnt right

[26-Mar-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure minseconds has passed and add a destpubkey vin to the recover tx and make sure that is there

[26-Mar-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
how is this impossible to fix??

[26-Mar-19 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it is not, but I couldnt see any simple way.

[26-Mar-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and where is it bypassing all the checks, in the validation 'U' case it sure seems to go through all the validation steps

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
line 277 returns true before everything is checked

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so add check for minseconds and vin signed by destination pubkey

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt that work>

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
?

[26-Mar-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if minseconds has passed and the receiver is willing to recover funds without rewards, let them

[26-Mar-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe, if I can work out hwo to do that ... it seems those checks are inside rewards calc ... but there is no reward in this tx

[26-Mar-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
just move the reward = RewardsCalc(amount,tx.vin[0].prevout.hash,APR,minseconds,maxseconds,mindeposit) to above the recover if statement

[26-Mar-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
why wont that work?

[26-Mar-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would work?

[26-Mar-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
amount is the principal amount in vout[0], isnt it?

[26-Mar-19 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Mar-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
RewardsCalc only needs that to calculate reward, right?

[26-Mar-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but you dont even need to know the reward, you just need to know minseconds

[26-Mar-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
which is part of the plan, which is known

[26-Mar-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
confused by your confusion

[26-Mar-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... but what is minseconds calcuated from, CCduration of each vin I guess?

[26-Mar-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
minseconds is baked into the rewards plan on plan creation? at least that is what i remember, but it was a long time ago i wrote it

[26-Mar-19 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean what I need to compare minseconds to

[26-Mar-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
minseconds is already set!

[26-Mar-19 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
minseconds is there yes ... but what is it that compares to...

[26-Mar-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
elapsed time is returned by CCduration()

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
against what tx?

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each vin?

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and if the youngest vin is old enough, then it is fine

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
all vins must be minseconds old

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
there also needs to be a normal vin signed by the destination, this fixes alrights "dos" attack

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and recover is needed, even if it is nearly impossible to implement

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I understand that part, you dont want any one releaseing funds without rewards apart from the person who locked them

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise, if the plan funds every run out, all funds get locked

[26-Mar-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and even, the point of view that if you want to unlock all your coins without any reward, maybe it is possible at anytime

[26-Mar-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if the minseconds check is impossible to do

[26-Mar-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess if you just want them back with no reward and nobody else can do it it may be ok to just ignore minseconds

[26-Mar-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i can go either way on it.

[26-Mar-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do we know if the globabl txfee fix works yet ? I assume its ok, but had no way to test it
