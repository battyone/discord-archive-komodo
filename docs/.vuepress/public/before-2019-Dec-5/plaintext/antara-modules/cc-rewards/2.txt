it should work

[26-Mar-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems "Seems rewards would need a major redesign to fix this problem." was not correct then as just adding a normal vin and validating it is there is just adding a missing validation

[26-Mar-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so please before making such alarmist statements, make sure you are correct, or you become the one that cries wolf

CC have total control over the inputs and outputs. and arbitrary C code that validates, it is extremely unlikely that even a gross design flaw cannot be fixed and most things are just missing validations. now without the normal vin, it would indeed be impossible, but we are allowed to modify the tx in question

[26-Mar-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is still new to you and I remember at first, I had those moments too, when I thought it just wont work in a CC

[26-Mar-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but so far, always, there has been a solution, to the point where entire rogue gameplay is fed into validation

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and i am also fiddling with realtime user events that will go into the validation, so over time I went from not really understanding what CC can do, to where I am now, where my assumption is that CC can do it, just a matter to figure out how

[26-Mar-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once I started thinking of validation as "what do I need to add to the tx in order to be able to validate efficiently" things became easier. dont view the tx as unchangeable

[26-Mar-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
like when we found we needed the txidpk in the payments CC validation, it wasnt there and there was no opreturn... so we just make a new vout with txidpk in it

[26-Mar-19 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I thaught becuse it was such an old CC we cant change these thigns as it would hard fork it... if that is not the case then its not such a problem. I will try and fix it

[26-Mar-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the rpc generated tx have two masters, the actual functionality and the validation

[26-Mar-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
avoiding hardfork is nice too, but I am not aware of any mainnet usage of rewards CC yet

[26-Mar-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is if you add the vin validation, all the current chains will sync

[26-Mar-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
unless alright messed with something other than test chains

[26-Mar-19 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
is mindeposit check on recover mode not possible?

[26-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Alright#0419
It kind of defeats the purpose of locking coins in the first place if you can unlock them whenever

[26-Mar-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem easy no ... but as long as its being unlocked by the person who locked it then that doesnt really amtter does it? as they dont get any rewards

[26-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Alright#0419
the reward is from locking coins, if you can unlock them at any time, what is the risk in locking them?

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
I see this as "having faith" in the project, you get some rewards. Show that you won't dump your coins for the next n days and you're rewarded

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can withdraw coins from a master node ata any time.  was this not to emulate a masternode?

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
MNs has steady payouts though

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
idk, it just seems weird that you can unlock coins prior to their minimum unlock date

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
there is no risk in locking coins, I thought that was the whole point

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree, but it seems extremly difficult to prevent while still having the recover possible

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
What makes a normal unlock different?

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] Alright#0419
in that you can check min deposit time

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it is possible ... will ppl actaulyl use this though it could take me a while to work that out...

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also need to figure out how its checking it... as going gettransactions on every bin then CCduration seems inefficiant

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe its already doing this

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but minseconds can be honored

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
why not?

[26-Mar-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
CCduration on all 3 vins wont take long at all

[26-Mar-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe I can move rewards calc up higher safey and use a flag pointer

[26-Mar-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if any vin does not meet return false

[26-Mar-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, something like that. on a scale of 1 to 10, about 3 in difficulty level to fix this cleanly

[26-Mar-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it is only on validation side that is required I think it will be ok

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I must have misread the RPC .. if the rpc is indeed doing this already then its pretty simple

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so once locked, funds wont be able to be unlocked until minimum time

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the rpc can be bypassed by evil hacker

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
validation needs to validate rpc created tx and not validate things that bypass the rpc

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I read it as, no avalible inputs automatically unlock with no reward ... but clearly I was wrong

[26-Mar-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
unless it is still following the rules properly

[26-Mar-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well, the rpc protected against that, but the hacker could have done exactly that

[26-Mar-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
at validation time the availability of rewards funds could change, so it cant use that as a test

[26-Mar-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need to decide how this will be fixed and update the docs appropriately

[26-Mar-19 10:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I need to workout how to actually test it, and make a test chain and just mess with it...

[26-Mar-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it was a very annoying bug as a blocknotify script could have scanned each lock as they are made and instantly unlock it

[26-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
no reason anybody would do that, but once made it would always be there, so this cant be ignored

[26-Mar-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it will be that hard to fix but I struggle without being able to make prints and see what is going on

[26-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
plus the evil miner sucking out all the funds with big txfee

[26-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i like printouts too

[26-Mar-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
why cant you add prints?

[26-Mar-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to work out how to test with it, after tea I will make a test chain and try and replicate the issue here

[26-Mar-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should help move things along faster

[26-Mar-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so this is under control?

[26-Mar-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what about payments CC, are there any bugs with it?

[26-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
easy way to test would be with PAY, invalidate block 5017 on PAY, change code to fix txfee bug, reconsider 5017

[26-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
should reject 5018

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
then a couple blocks before that there is unlocks prior to minimum deposit

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
do the same with that

[26-Mar-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure about payments, it seemed to work for me

[26-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might need the global txfee fix

[26-Mar-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
evil miner txfee bug is fixed?

[26-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code that prevents rewards doing it should work for any CC

[26-Mar-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it enforces the txfee cannot be larger than 10k sat on any tx

[26-Mar-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is provided the coins view can be relied upon... I think it can as connectblock uses it

[26-Mar-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, when you make pull request for rewards, you can add the payments CC fix too

[26-Mar-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, hopefully I can test the miner fee thing with what Alright said above.

[26-Mar-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it works there it shuld work anywhere., maybe it can be a util function for any TX.

[26-Mar-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, always good to make new and useful util functions

[26-Mar-19 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol cant even sync PAY

[26-Mar-19 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```valueout.899990000 vs valuein.1000000000 txfee.10000

@Alright  looks fine here. are those amounts correct to you if you remeber?

[26-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
it was 10 locked coins, stole 1

[26-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
so 0.0001 from the rewardslock txfee

[26-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
then 0.0001 + 1 for rewardsunlock i think

[26-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Alright#0419
I think that's correct

[26-Mar-19 10:33 AM] Alright#0419
value in was 9.9999 I think?

[26-Mar-19 10:33 AM] Alright#0419
could be wrong, just look at it

[26-Mar-19 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the code is pretty simple ... going to make it into a function then. So you just pass it a pointer to a tx, and if the tx fee isnt 10ksat it juse returns false... that way works for every CC with minimal changes

[26-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't need to happen on every single CC tx

[26-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
just CC txs that spend from global CC address

[26-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
not being able to set txfee might be a limitation in the future

[26-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
so we should do it only where we *need* to

[26-Mar-19 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah understood... but as a function it makes it much easier to use, that is provided its correct. Its up to the person making the CC to decide if they need to enforce the fixed tx fee. I think in places it will be unavoidable to do it.

[26-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Alright#0419
it's unavoidable if tx spends from global CC address

[26-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Alright#0419
unnecessary if it doesn't

[26-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Alright#0419
can't think of any situation where it would be needed other than when spending from global CC address

[26-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your sure on that 100%? So for payments it only needs to check this, if there is a vin from global address?

[26-Mar-19 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not if itse being spent from the txidpk?

[26-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
if you're ever spending money that doesn't belong to you, txfee must be static 10k sats

[26-Mar-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe for payments then it needs to be all the time then I think. Guess you will need to try and break it to be sure.,

[26-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Alright#0419
paymentsrelease, definitely

[26-Mar-19 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool

[26-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Alright#0419
would be cool to set default mining behavior to prioritize txs that spend from global CC address

[26-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
not necessary right now, but we might need it in the future if a chain has full blocks

[26-Mar-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might slow it down a fair bit as there can be a lot of those

[26-Mar-19 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
Yep, guess you want to just make more chains before you hit full blocks

[26-Mar-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
checking every single tx against that list seems like it would bog down fast, unless there was some tricky way to do it

[26-Mar-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok well it seems I have a catch all for miner stealing CC funds.

[26-Mar-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
simple bool function
