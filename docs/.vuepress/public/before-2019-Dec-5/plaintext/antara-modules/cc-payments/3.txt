@blackjok3r  So what is actually the problem? That the values in both cases differ by 1 like round error or the values are totally different?

[13-May-19 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they differ by a percentage it seems, with smaller amounts it is usually 1 sat, but when I do large airdrops its out by a lot more. 
I can send you a chain and command to reproduce if you need? May need my jl777 repo though to check it.

[13-May-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its possible we can just allow for some percentage of variance instead of a hard coded number, havent seen anything over 1000 sat so far, but Havent tested many values.

[13-May-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured it was more likely some mistake on my part than somehting that would differ though

[13-May-19 12:35 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, please send the chain and call params

[13-May-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

sounds similar to the rounding error @Decker fixed in iguana that seemed random.
Decker do you have a link to the explanation of where you found the rounding error?

[23-May-19 05:11 PM] Mylo#8306
cpl weeks late, sorry

[23-May-19 08:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Can you explain ‚Äòdestopret‚Äô and how it is used?

[19-Jun-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you need to send to a.crypto condition script pubkey that requires an opreturn to be valid the hex goes there

[19-Jun-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does that make sense?

[19-Jun-19 10:55 AM] gcharang#6833
~~is it for funding faucet, rewards, heir etc.,?
what is the hex that goes there?~~

[19-Jun-19 12:24 PM] gcharang#6833
I think I get it
```
the value of "destopret" is used in the opreturn of the transaction that sends the coins to the scriptpubkey 
if the scriptpubkey belongs to a CC that expects a opret in the txn that sends coins to it, then destopret will be used by it
```
@blackjok3r 
correct me if I am wrong

[19-Jun-19 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes seems correct. 
Basically it was designed for paymentsCC to pay a rewardsCC plan, which requires an op_return attacced to its funding transaction. Other wise funds sent there would be burnt, as the rewards plan wouldnt know what plan the fund were for.

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Payments CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!
