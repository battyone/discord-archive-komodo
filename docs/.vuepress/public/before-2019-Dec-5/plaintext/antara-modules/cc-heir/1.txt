Is there any way to check how much time is left before I can claim inheritance?
```"inactivity time setting": "600",```
In `heirinfo` seems to be static

[20-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
it is meant to be static, dimxy said he may be able to add timestamp that it's counting down from

[20-Jan-19 10:36 AM] Alright#0419
that number is just the number you set when you created it

[20-Jan-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
I see

[20-Jan-19 10:37 AM] Alright#0419

[20-Jan-19 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
So is this param is the way to detect that funds are available to claim ` "spending allowed for the heir": "false"` ?

[20-Jan-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[20-Jan-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
once True, heir can do `heirclaim`

[20-Jan-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, waiting for 10 minutes until I'm officially ded according to the heir plan 😃

[20-Jan-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
``` "spending allowed for the heir": "true",``` param is switched

[20-Jan-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Something strange is happened after I've claimed full sum from heir node:
There is no heirplan anymore
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY10 heirinfo e2156011f3022ced7dc3ca935f72ae0d769de950eb2b6d1d215fb71eff212844536936334
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "could not find heir cc plan for this txid (no initial tx)"
}
```
Coins reduced from heirplan creation node but not appeared on heir node

[20-Jan-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
can you post `getrawtransaction <txid> 2` for the heirclaim tx

[20-Jan-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/3WhQCFj7YT/

[20-Jan-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Initially I've created a plan with  this funding 0.63855552 (because didn't know that denomination is in satoshies) then added more to make it ```6.29556e+06```

[20-Jan-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Then claimed 6295560

[20-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Alright#0419
so it looks like you did claim the full amount

[20-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Alright#0419
but it sent change to the CC address when it shouldn't have?

[20-Jan-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
``` "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.06295560,
      "valueSat": 6295560,```

[20-Jan-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder that some bad thing with powers happened

[20-Jan-19 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
looking at the code it seems it will always pay change to cc address

[20-Jan-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Since I've supposed to claim 6295560 coins not satoshies

[20-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/b4e0b6bca4676407145b640f48101846ade1ee57/src/cc/heir.cpp#L650
is `inputs` here sum of CC inputs or all inputs?

[20-Jan-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah I think it's just my mistake since I've called:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY10 heirclaim 0 6295560 e2156011f3022ced7dc3ca935f72ae0d769de950eb2b6d1d215fb71eff212844```
What is equal to `0.06295560` 
This number ` "6.29556e+06"` need to multiply twice to get sum in satoshies: first time on 10^6 and second time on 10^8

[20-Jan-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
6.29 ^ +06 is 6.3 million

[20-Jan-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
or 0.063

[20-Jan-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you just need to convert the scientific notation to %0.8

[20-Jan-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
So questions now are: where is the change and why plan is not available anymore when I've claimed only little part - is it by design?

[20-Jan-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
`"6.29556e+06"` I've converted it to 6295560 but also have to convert from coins to satoshies since heir doing all calculations in it

[20-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
you did claim the full amount, but the change from your inputs went back to a CC address when it shouldn't have

[20-Jan-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm how I claimed full amount if more than 6 million of coins were locked:
 "funding total in coins": "6.29556e+06"
But I've claimed only 0.063 coins

[20-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
likely in satoshis

[20-Jan-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
There were two inputs in heir:

```Add1of2AddressInputs() satoshis=63855552

Add1of2AddressInputs() satoshis=629555520000000
```
First on 0.638 coin
Second 62955552 coins

[20-Jan-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
I've claimed `6295560` satoshies =  0.06295560 coins

[20-Jan-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
And after it plan is not available anymore and I don't have my 6 million coins back

[20-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
Ah didn't realize you locked that many, thought you just meant the print was showing it in coins instead of sats

[20-Jan-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
No, I've naturally locked 6 million coins 😃

[22-Jan-19 11:01 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  hi,  I could not recreate it when heir plan is lost after claiming full amount.

ok, NP.
I'll push the heir corrections today. And i'm going to change marker type (cause it is bad now). So it would not find previous heir plans

[22-Jan-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
I have to spin the new chain for re-test so. Will start to cover RPC calls by tests in parallel with manual testing

[22-Jan-19 11:30 AM] TonyL#3577

[25-Jan-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
the heir CC is very exciting stuff. I have been thinking about solving the same exact problem, in a different way, via the memo field. I think both can be married together, where you can store "real" + "notarized by a human notary" will+testament directly in a blockchain via memo fields or OP_RETURN and have that integrated with a heir CC. Kind of like a bridge from the physical world to the blockchain

[25-Jan-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, you might want to give the executor of a physical will access to a heir CC, or tell them how to use the funds/etc

[25-Jan-19 03:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think there could be one more field in opret when you add funds for a memo string and you can say for each funds what to do with them

[25-Jan-19 03:45 PM] dimxy#2587
Is there a limit for OP_RETURN length?

[25-Jan-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
10000 bytes

[25-Jan-19 04:11 PM] dimxy#2587
would it be enough to store real world docs?

[25-Jan-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe spread across many opreturns

[25-Jan-19 04:24 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm slicing data on chunks which fit OP_RETURN CC limitation  (8Kb chunks) and broadcast 800kb (it's a limitation just from head and can be changed) per block (100 chunks) in oracles file uploader

[25-Jan-19 04:25 PM] TonyL#3577
If it will be not in oracle probably can use few bytes less in data chunk and in first few bytes encode chunk number / some additional info

or, maybe store not the payload itself but its hash?

Store only control sum hash?

It sounds interesting

Possible to use as metadata and store main file on S3
