[30-Oct-19 01:37 PM] SHossain#0007
but, i withdrew `0.001` and got back `0.0008`

[30-Oct-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
0.0002 used for txfee on 2 places? 2x 0.0001

[30-Oct-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be good to use lowest txfees for withdraws, maybe 0.00001 if zero txfee wont be reliable

[30-Oct-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i know we use 0.0001 for txfee in most all places, but if doing BTC or even GOLD, 0.0001 is on the expensive side

[30-Oct-19 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, lower txfee for BTC and GOLD would be awesome

[30-Oct-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i think txfee of 1000 sats should just work, for now that makes it not so bad, and 10 cents per transaction is not cheap, but would get decent hashrate on the chain

[30-Oct-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
we might want to change the mintxfee (whereever it is in the code) to 100 sats for the high value coins

[30-Oct-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
generally on all smart chains i use 0 txfee...even some txs of KMD i use 0 fee

[30-Oct-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
and, it works perfectly

[30-Oct-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
on KMD with 0 fee it might take some extra time to get confirmation

[30-Oct-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
few script from Decker and few LABS script has this 0 fee thing

[30-Oct-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i guess you can verify this with settxfee

[30-Oct-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but not sure that is used by the CC rpc

[30-Oct-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure it isnt, but we do need to solve the $1 txfee issue before spinning up even a BTC test chain as that can get expensive very fast

[30-Oct-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll test with txfee 1000 sats soon on KMD and MBTCTEST chain. need to get some groceries first üôÇ

[30-Oct-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
after few more successful deposits and withdrawals i'll try to use invalid parameters/data

[30-Oct-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
it is good that both deposit and withdraw are working now

[30-Oct-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll also update the gist guide with withdrawal steps

[30-Oct-19 02:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
CC rpc have fixed txfee in the code of 10k sat

[30-Oct-19 02:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
We could make it per CC contract to define txfee

[30-Oct-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, however we can solve it is good

[30-Oct-19 03:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Is there some limitation in code for txfee amount? Like if you set below some amount it will get lower priority?

[30-Oct-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i think somewhere there is a 1000 sats minimum where if it isnt there, it is very low priority, but not sure. maybe you can look into that a bit

{Reactions}
üëç 

[30-Oct-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the miner can mine whatever txfee it wants to, so maybe any txfee is fine from a consensus standpoint and we just need to tweak the miner

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
Thanks for the explanation re: redeeming kUSD, this truly is the most awesome crypto lending system I‚Äôve heard of.

[30-Oct-19 04:27 PM] tolken#2655
AtomicDex market makers could do some nice automated kUSD to USDc trades move back to fiat relatively easy.

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] tolken#2655
considering Salt, Nexo Lending at BEST offer 6% loans (with less favorable terms), trading 5% Kmd for a loan is a no brainer.

[31-Oct-19 11:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c As we also have markers in CCs, and that does affect something like txfee affects mining, I suppose we can lower the value of the marker even below 1k sats. Maybe put it 1 sat? üòõ

[31-Oct-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
for markers that wont be spent, maybe that is good, for markers that need to be spent, it is a very small utxo. but optimizing this area is important when each coin is $10000

[01-Nov-19 10:24 AM] Mihailo#5902
On MBTC chain (importgateway), there are no markers that won't be spent I think (gateways have those markes on gatewaysdeposit, and importgatewaydeposit have tombstone). There are also markers that will be spent and put back to users address (example signers that sign txs will get marker value when they do markdone tx).

[01-Nov-19 11:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c It would be good to lower the fees of oracles too (to 1000sats), as if someone else takes to mine the chain he will get the txfees of oracles transactions. On a chain with big coins like BTC 10k sats can be noticable.

[01-Nov-19 11:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Also is there a way we can set default txfee for regular txs. I think 5k sat is regular when using sendtoaddress.

[01-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
I see that 5k is hardcoded in sendtoaddress:
```cpp
                CAmount nFeeNeeded = GetMinimumFee(nBytes, nTxConfirmTarget, mempool);
                if ( nFeeNeeded < 5000 )
                    nFeeNeeded = 5000;```
By current BTC price, one tx would be ~0.5$

[01-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain Are there any noticable issues on MBTC or USDK?

[01-Nov-19 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
no other issues observed

[01-Nov-19 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
is your `txfeetest` branch ready for testing?

[01-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
Not yet, I need to modify oracles and bring up test chain with 2 nodes and setup everything to see if it works.

[01-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain try to abuse MBTCTEST little bit. I'm sure there should be some sanity checks for input data, like we had a problem with pubkey and address. So try to see which parameters can be modifed and the tx passes.
The biggest problem I see could be on withdraw side, as we made it to be sequential (1 withdraw at a time), so if some withdraw is blocked it will stall everything.

[01-Nov-19 01:16 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. i'm on it

[01-Nov-19 01:16 PM] SHossain#0007
if i find inconsistencies or if something doesn't make sense, i'll post üôÇ

[01-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Great

[01-Nov-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo i think most of the txfee changes are not-consensus related, but you need to be careful when changing it. i have not looked into all the details, for oracles, gateways and other areas where cost matters, we should use the lowest txfee that is possible, whatever that is

[01-Nov-19 02:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Understand.

[01-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
Just one more question. Do we want to make a ac parameter to set txfee for all CC modules for example?

[01-Nov-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
probably not. just tune the txfee as low as we can across the board

[01-Nov-19 02:31 PM] SHossain#0007
error check for oracles seems to be in place and working
```

}

[01-Nov-19 02:32 PM] SHossain#0007
when the block height is not passed, importgatewaydeposit wouldn't work and throw that error. it works fine as soon as oracle validation is done

[01-Nov-19 02:46 PM] SHossain#0007
did you put the validation for withdraw on pubkey or pubaddr?

[01-Nov-19 02:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't want another reorg :abused:

[01-Nov-19 06:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
walidation is to have a pubkey, so if you put addr it shouldn't validate, even rpc won't allow it

[01-Nov-19 06:03 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. let me test this. didn't want to put address in there just in case
