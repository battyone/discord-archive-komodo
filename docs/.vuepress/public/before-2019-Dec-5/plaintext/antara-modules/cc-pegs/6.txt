now, let's wait for KMD price change. this will change the ratio

Yes, have to make it consistent

[06-Aug-19 02:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c As this is the test setup and nobody is monitoring the chain we have this situation:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KUSDTEST pegsinfo a130861d422655cb28ffbf788c3b4a07748ba67eb7c413c9440b7cbbfcb9d296

😄 😄 😄

[06-Aug-19 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
where does that 6.49% comes from?

[06-Aug-19 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
price flactuations?

[06-Aug-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
are you using the 24 hour average price?

[06-Aug-19 02:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Basically, the debt is in USD and deposit in KMD, if you calculate it with current price you will get that 106.49% is issued. Price fell down!
But in a regular working pegs chain this should not happen, as there will be liquidators which will liquidate accounts which pass over threshold (90%)

[06-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Using price [2]

[06-Aug-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
how could the ratio change so fast?

[06-Aug-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to use 24hr price

[06-Aug-19 02:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
No, this is global ratio. For whole pegs

[06-Aug-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
oh. so you had positions already opened

[06-Aug-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
liquidator nodes needs to be running

[06-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
Isn't the price on index 2 in array the 24h price?

[06-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, no liquidators for now

[06-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i think so

[06-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i though shossain account went from 50% to 106% in a few blocks

[06-Aug-19 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
will there be a nice TUI which will remember all txids for local node and tester can select to test? it would make testing easier for my level :abused_smiley:

[06-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Mihailo#5902
Definitely there should be a TUI 😉 There is TUI for gateways, but maybe @TonyL could make one dedicated for pegs with gateway part

so bad, nobody wants it

[07-Aug-19 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just confirm... I've run thru this twice, and get `couldnt find merkleroot for ht.1476655 KMD oracle.bde7c4fb8f7f402891d350715c308179193e4c961c90cac0740a7e89d561b437 m.0 vs n.1`

Had oraclefeed running, but insufficient funds to subscribe to it so likely not writing. I assume using the funded oracle pubkey (not mine) returned from oraclesinfo wont work for me?

So to use PegsCC, I need enough funds to 
-subscribe to and fund oracle
-do the gateways transactions
before I can issue Pegs commands?
I've been mining for over 24 hrs, and my balance is only 0.0063
what balance will be sufficient to cover cost of oraclefeed writes without going broke before I can submit a gatewaysdeposit?

[07-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Did you do this on KUSDTEST chain? There you won't need to run oraclefeed. In public use of pegsCC notary nodes will run oraclefeed and be in charge of the gateway so you will only need funds to do gateways tx. I have even changed gateways claim to not add any inputs as there is a marker from deposit tx that can be used for txfee. So you will only need 10k sat to use pegs.

[07-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
Let me check oraclefeed on KUSDTEST as yesterday it was not working because KMD daemon was down.

[07-Aug-19 12:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is working now. Have to check why it is crashing

[07-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  You'll have data from block 1476711

[07-Aug-19 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thanks, so I dont have to run the feed as a user, its run globally but the chain owner? 🆒

[07-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes. The chain owner should setup the gatreway with as much signers possible so it is enough decentrilized. Those msig signers will run oraclefeed so that deposits and withdraw works. In case of pegsCC probably the NNs will be gateways signers and run oraclefeed so you could have the trust in whole system

[07-Aug-19 12:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
I mean, anybody can setup the pegCC on their own chain. But for users to trust it it must have some reliable gateway multisig signers

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Mihailo below is my attempt to communicate PegsCC in laymans terms. Could you please confirm / correct as required?
```PegCC builds upon on the existing Antara modules Tokens, Gateways, Prices and Oracles.
Tokens are created, and transmitted across chains using Gateways for use within the Pegs chain.
Oracles communicate information about tokens deposited via the Gateway via an “oraclefeed” app, run by the chain owner (and potentially notary nodes).
Oracles also communicate Prices in a trustless manner from a range of external sources, with a 24hr delay.
Via the above, 80% of the value of deposited tokens can be exchanged for a “stablecoin” (e.g. USDK) at current Prices market value as reported by the trustless oracle. It is effectively a “deposit and loan” system, where deposited tokens secure the loan.
The USDK tokens can be traded for fiat / other crypto, or redeemed for the originally deposited crypto used to create them.
If the value of the deposited coin rises, additional USDK is created and available to account holder to withdraw, improving their debt ratio. 
If the value of the deposited coin falls, the worst accounts are subject to liquidation. In this event, a third party can gain a 5% return by paying the debt of the account with an excessive debt ratio (e.g. > 90%). The remainder will be applied to the chain as a whole to improve the global debt ratio to prevent underlying assets of the chain falling below the value of total USDK issued.
```

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```For example:
Bob uses gatewaysdeposit to convert 100 KMD to KMDT when the market value is $5 per KMD
Bob uses pegsfund to open a new account and then pegsget to convert this KMDT for 375 USDK.
Bob now has 100 KMD (worth $500) securing a “loan” of 375 USDK (worth $375), effectively a 75% debt ratio (375:500). 
Note: This is the opposite of fractional reserve lending!
After some time, KMD rises to $10. Bob’s debt ratio is now a very healthy 37.5% (375:1000). 
Bob decides to take some profit and exchanges for an additional 375 USDK, rising his debt ratio to 75% (750:1000). 
Bob trades 250 USDK over the counter for $250 USD fiat.
At this stage, Bob’s original 100 KMDT deposit worth $500 at time of account creation has been converted into 750 USDK. He has sold part of this for $250 in fiat, still has 100KMD (worth $1000) securing his account, and has 500 USDK (worth $500) to trade with - a combined total value of $1750 from his original input of 100KMD ($500 at time of account creation).
```

[08-Aug-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```After some more time passes, the price of KMD drops back down to $8.25. Bob’s debt ratio is now at a dangerous level of 90.0909% (750:825), and subject to liquidation.
Alice uses pegsworstaccounts and sees Bob’s debt ratio has left him vulnerable. She decides to liquidate Bob’s account using pegsliquidate,  buying out Bob’s account for 750 USDK. 
At the current market price of $8.25, the 100KMD which was securing Bob’s account is worth $825. Alice receives a 5% bonus worth 37.5 USDK on top of the 750 USDK cost of liquidating Bob’s account, which is paid out in the form of 95.4545 KMDT, worth $787.5 at the current KMD price of $8.25.
The remaining 4.5454 KMDT from Bob’s account is used to maintain the integrity of the pegs chain by reducing the global debt ratio.
Bob still has his remaining 500 USDK (worth $500), and the US$250 fiat he traded for earlier ($750 total). 
The liquidated 100 KMDT account previously securing Bob’s account (worth $825) is closed, netting Bob a loss of $75 against current $8.25 KMD price at liquidation for failing to maintain a good debt ratio. Fortunately for Bob, he’s still up $250 against the original $500 input at account creation (100 KMD at $5), and has suffered no net loss.
As Bob no longer has an account, he can use pegsexchange to convert his USDK to KMDT and either cash out with pegsredeem to reclaim 90 KMD, or use pegsfund to open a new account and then pegsget to convert up to 80% of his KMDT to USDK.
```

[08-Aug-19 12:45 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Incidentally, at the risk of sounding juvenile, the `pegsexchange` method risks being misread by giggling teenagers.

[08-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Basically that is it, there is a little bit mixing up coins and tokens in the first part. USDK is coin and KMDT is token of real KMD coin. Also, I wouldn't say oraclefeed ran by the chain owner as it can be understood as centralization. And in the last part when there is pegsexchange there is no pegsredeem then. Pegsredeem is used when you have account and pegsexchange when you don't have account. There user wil get deposited tokens and to withdraw them on external chain (the deposited coins) it calls gatewayswithdraw.

[08-Aug-19 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902

[08-Aug-19 02:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[11-Aug-19 04:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
when liquidating a worst account, I assume the entire debt needs to be paid off? Would it be feasible to allow partial payment/liquidation ?

[11-Aug-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the owner can do a partial payment, not sure about third parties. it might actually be needed in case there is a very large account that needs to be liquidated

[12-Aug-19 05:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
For now I haven't implemented partial liquidation, but as @jl777c said it may be needed to implement it. But then it will need careful funds balance, as for now if you pay whole debt you get ~5.1% profit depending on who much is the debt ratio. If it is 91% then there 9% left for liquidator profit and system improvment. If 96% then there is inly 4% left. If you do partial liquidating we need to see how to distribute the rest.

[12-Aug-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the amounts are just prorated

[12-Aug-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so if 20% of the debt is being liquidated, just divide all the numbers by 5

[12-Aug-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
what remains has an improved ratio and whoever does this is saving the other 80%, but without this we can get stuck where there is a non-liquidatable large balance

[12-Aug-19 08:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, we can do that. But we should just think about if there is some weird cases that we should prevent. I don't know, maybe there is a partial liquidation and then price changes and something goes wrong 😛

[14-Aug-19 01:16 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
did a fast read of docs...this might potentially only work if it supports BTC and high liquidity crypto

KUSD might be seen as a wide range usage token by lot of people.

KMD is a lot less utility coin since its kind of investment and lacks liquidity of main market coins

As a result, market makers can easily take KMD price 10% down in main markets and take profit of the broken contracts...

Unless I missread oracles and the 24h delay and some kind of 24h average makes it harder/not economical to take KMD price down for a lot of time...which would make the above scheme a bit more difficult

this is a good read of how hardly DAI will be able to scale: https://medium.com/@hasufly/maker-dai-stable-but-not-scalable-3107ba730484

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Sorry for late reply, it seems I had food poisoning yesterday, I almost vomited my soul 😫

hope all the poison has been expelled!

For the KUSDTEST, I've made gateway with 1of1 signature so it must be only the one pubkey it is registred. In case when notaries will run gateways it will be m of n pubkeys that will run oraclefeed and also sign withdraw txs.

It seems that komodod is crashing, oraclefeed keeps runing but there is no daemon for KMD 😮

[15-Aug-19 05:20 AM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe it is a memory problem, I have only 4g on that machine and running two kmd daemons and oraclefeed

[15-Aug-19 05:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
strange, wonder what is upsetting it. Good that the multisig is an option, I was wondering about the distribution of oraclefeed input without possibility of invalid data being broadcast by nefarious nodes

I had similar issues on LABs earlt on with smaller VPS, adding some swap helped but moved to larger VPS a while ago

[15-Aug-19 05:22 AM] Mihailo#5902
Only pubkeys that are set in gateways will be checked for block data in oracle, so it won't be able to submit invalid data. Also I think half of pubkeys are needed to have submitted the block data in order to have valid block data in oracle.

might be something we can test in LABS?

We should definitely put this on some machines with more ram...

@Mihailo  @Alright  is there some docs for creating the tx to be used as the `earlytxid` launch param?

[17-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator yea I have a draft... somewhere

[17-Aug-19 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
😅 don't have access to the machine it's on atm, can give you the gist of it if you need it
