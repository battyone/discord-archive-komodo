[28-Oct-19 01:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
Are you mining on receipent node?

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, that is the reason why balance is increasing. But what is strange is that it shouldn't allow rewards from mining.

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i guess that is where the 0.0064 coins came from?

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Can you give me chain params?

[28-Oct-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[28-Oct-19 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[28-Oct-19 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the chain does have reward.

[28-Oct-19 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but it was just a premine.

[28-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, ac_end is 1 so it will stop after 1st block.

[28-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahhhh, sorry. Totaly forgot. I had this problem recently.

[28-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Because you are mining, and there is noreward you get only txfees. As there are several txs created by oraclefeed, your node which is mining is getting txfees

[28-Oct-19 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
So don't mine on recepient test node!!!

[28-Oct-19 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, im using @dimxy  's repo which lets me integrate the price chain within the pegs chain.

[28-Oct-19 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
As you will get coins increased

[28-Oct-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
for chains with very expensive reference price, even 0,0001 txfee is a lot, maybe we need to support zero txfee for the special transactions

[28-Oct-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
this is up to the miner

[28-Oct-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah... i feel like i did something but dont get what i did lol

[28-Oct-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not sure how many coins i should have recieved with the funding i did.

[28-Oct-19 01:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, to the chainparams you need to add ```-ac_earlytxid=ee6089e938a46ef88702d364d3b352f0a263e3e25947d64dd0de9b22541f6f6b```

[28-Oct-19 01:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
With funding you receive nothing. So you can send all the coins to other node

[28-Oct-19 01:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which was not done early btw.

[28-Oct-19 01:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i need to execute pegsget, right?

[28-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Mihailo#5902

[28-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
Fund is to fund the tokens to account, and get is to get the coins!

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
What is the price?

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
Of gold

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```poll_one_feed polling...
XAU_USD 14967948```

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
$1496.79

[28-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
I don't know if dimxys code is latest with pegs. I think I had some changes for that but not sure.

[28-Oct-19 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i may need to wait for 100confs once again

[28-Oct-19 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i didnt do the -TESTMODE variable when i built it before starting thetesting

[28-Oct-19 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that has extended my testing for about a week or so.

[28-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, you must do TESMODE as it is a hell without it

[28-Oct-19 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i ve been through hell... hehehe

[28-Oct-19 01:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so my guess of having to wait for 100confs on the pegsfund is correct?

[28-Oct-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
until it is notarized

[28-Oct-19 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but the chain is not being notarized yet.

[28-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Mihailo#5902
You must wait 100confs on every tx that changes account, basically every tx ecept info txs.

[28-Oct-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is why to use TESTMODE

[28-Oct-19 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if right now i recompile with TESTMODE i can just spin the same chain again and get immediate confs?

[28-Oct-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as all the nodes are doing TESTMODE, then validation will be fine

[28-Oct-19 01:57 PM] dimxy#2587
To merge my prices code (with gold support) with the latest pegs cc I need to push my prices to FSM branch
But i changed the config of prices polling of web resources (there is a new -ac_feeds param instead of -ac_prices and stocks). So I wonder how many people will be affected with this and how to warn them

[28-Oct-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as ac_prices still works, it should be fine

[28-Oct-19 02:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, trying again the pegsfund with TESTMODE

[28-Oct-19 02:10 PM] dimxy#2587
Ok I'provide the  convertation of  ac_prices into ac_feeds

[28-Oct-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
wait, there seems a misunderstanding

[28-Oct-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you didnt remove ac_prices did  you?

[28-Oct-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, it should still be there and -ac_feeds is an additional way, ie. backward compatible

[28-Oct-19 03:09 PM] dimxy#2587
I removed them as I am managing ac_feeds as a single configuration vector and a corresponding array of the polled price data, but I have now realized that I could convert ac_prices and ac_stocks into two ac_feeds config items

[28-Oct-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
aha. plz keep in mind that backward compatibility is an important aspect

[28-Oct-19 03:12 PM] dimxy#2587
yes seems I forgot about that obvious solutionüò©

[28-Oct-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so this code is not yet merged, correct?

[28-Oct-19 03:30 PM] dimxy#2587
not yet, it is in my repo, as I did not khow then how to correctly provide the transition to this.
Now I know how to do it

You also need to be running KMD daemon and have a little bit of KMD to test. i.e.: 0.5 KMD or 1 KMD.
Test depositing 0.001 or 0.01 KMD and import it to MBTCTEST chain. Claim, withdraw. Try invalid commands, different pubkey to break things intentionally. If you find any bug, please report here.

Make sure both KMD & MBTCTEST chain are fully synced. (`getinfo` should display `"synced": true,` on 4th line)

if it is depositing KMD, why is it called MBTC? just curios

[28-Oct-19 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c i believe this is just for testing. we are testing with KMD now to get the basic things ready as testing with BTC might be expensive.

[28-Oct-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, makes sense

[28-Oct-19 05:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
MBTC is confusing

[28-Oct-19 05:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
does it relate to millibitcoin?

MBTC is supposed to mean that BTC is locked to multisignature address. That's what M stands for. But I agree it is very confusing. Same as KUDS, so we went to USDK. Maybe we should use BTCM, but this suggest as it is anothe BTC fork coin....
