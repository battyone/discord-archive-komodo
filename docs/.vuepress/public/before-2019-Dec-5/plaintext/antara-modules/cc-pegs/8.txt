current season is atomicdex, after another 3 or so months, maybe a shift to nspv integrations.

we are actually in the process of testing a chain pegged to Gold ounce price, backed by KMD

it is settled in KMD, not actual gold, that is what allows it to be 100% blockchain

[11-Oct-19 06:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's cool, where is the price derived from? A specific market?

[11-Oct-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a specific pricefeed, the important thing is that all nodes use the same pricefeed so the DTO consensus is reached

[11-Oct-19 06:31 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It'd be important to trust that price feed as well. I am not certain on gold prices around the world, but I'm sure they're all slightly different and managed by different entities

[11-Oct-19 07:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
or KGOLD?

[11-Oct-19 07:34 AM] scubapanda#2485
How does it work? If someone buy kgold with 1m KMD. Next week KMD price falls 50% and he sells kgold for KMD. Where does the extra 1m KMD come from?

[11-Oct-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the opposite, as the price falls the KGOLD is liquidated, restoring balance

[11-Oct-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810

it lets people borrow gold equivalent using KMD as collateral

[11-Oct-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
think of it as an interest free loan, which you need to make sure has enough collateral. if not, it gets liquidated at 5% to 10% equity. that is how the system restores balance

[11-Oct-19 08:13 AM] scubapanda#2485
Ok, thanks, now I understand it!

@jl777c I've looked at https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Pegs-CC but something doesn't make sense to me.  Maybe you can help me understand with this example. There are rumors Deutsche Bank may be insolvent.  I figure it might be a good idea to get the equivalent of one ounce of KGOLD on the Komodo platform. Gold is trading at $1500 USD/oz gold. KMD is trading at $1 USD/KMD. I have 3000 KMD so I convert it to 3000 KMDT. I then deposit that for 1 KGOLD.  I go to sleep, and when I wake up, the rumors about Deutche Bank are going wild.  Gold is up and trading at $2400 USD/oz. I decide these rumors are unfounded and liquidate the position.  I have a gain of $900 USD plus the original deposit of 3000 KMD still trading at $ 1USD, So I get back 3900 KMD.  As this position isn't hedged in the market and there is no counterparty to it, where is the 900 KMD coming from?

[23-Oct-19 11:53 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe because your KMDTokens will be backed by your KGOLD, the way you "liquidate" will be via the issuance(`pegsredeem`? of more KMDTokens because the price has increased. Therefore, all you have to do is redeem the tokens for KMD.
But I'm only just learning about this, so I may be wrong

[23-Oct-19 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@eBit i think you are making a few assumptions that are not quite right. first of all, with KGOLD, there is no need to have any USD equivalent involved, as we would make a direct GOLD/KMD price

[24-Oct-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the mechanism is most similar to an interest free loan. it might help to think of it in those terms

[24-Oct-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
you deposit KMD and borrow against it, up to 80% of the possible. to borrow 1 KGOLD at 1500 KMD per ounce, you would lock 1875 KMD and get 1 KGOLD. if gold price goes up 50% in a day, your "loan" went insolvent after several hours. the 1875 KMD would be eligible for liquidation when the GOLD per KMD price hits the 90% mark, around 1687 KMD per ounce of gold. at anytime after that between 1687 and 1875 price, ANYBODY can liquidate your account and arbitrage the difference. also keep in mind that the price used is the 24 hour average, not the instantaneous price

[24-Oct-19 12:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What is the benefit of using a 24hr average over instantaneous pricing? Also, what is the hypothetical that nobody liquidates, or there is a high percentage of liquidatable accounts for one specific peg?

[24-Oct-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
however, you still have the KGOLD, so you can convert it to 2400 KMD assuming the system has reserves to cover it. these reserves would come from other accounts that were liquidated. in the case where there is just a single KGOLD in existence, then of course it wont work without some prefunded amounts to cover this edge case

[24-Oct-19 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it relies on people liking 5% arbitrage, that is what keeps the overall system in balance. these liquidators are like miners, they are needed to keep the system working. the 24 hour price comes from the DTO price feed that is made resistant to price tampering. it is still possible to change the price, but would require actually changing the price for over 12 hours. it can be argued that if the price is changed for over 12 hours, the price actually did change

[24-Oct-19 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if instantaneous price was used, it would be easy to manipulate the price, by directly changing the KMD price, it assumes the overall liquidity of KMD is more than the peg liquidations

[24-Oct-19 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in the even of a massive and quick drop in price of KMD relative to the peg there will be a time period where nobody will see any benefit to liquidating as the 5% gain wont be enough to compensate. the 24 hour average will always correct to the actual price, but it is indeed possible for the entire peg to be underwater if it happens so fast, the overall liquidity cannot handle it.

[24-Oct-19 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in this case, the peg will trade at a discount, proportionally to the backing

[24-Oct-19 12:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That makes sense. How will supply of these pegs be controlled? Purely via KMDToken allocation and burning?
I suppose with massive liquidation, the price of tether would drop too :P

[24-Oct-19 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so in a way, it degrades gracefully during this underwater period and when the price goes up again, the peg will automatically be reasserted

[24-Oct-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you talk about tether?? there is no tether in this

[24-Oct-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the supply is created by anybody that wants an interest free loan to lock in the KMD price (in terms of the peg)

[24-Oct-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so as the KMD price goes up, there will be more and more supply created

[24-Oct-19 12:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was merely making a comparison to a stable coin that is currently used, that would act the same way in a massive liquidation event. Not saying that this has anything to do with it.

[24-Oct-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the creation of the KGOLD is decentralized. as KMD price goes up (number of KMD per ounce of gold goes down) it becomes more and more likely that KGOLD is issued. people who already deposite and borrowed at 80%, can borrow again based on how much below 80% their loan ratio is

[24-Oct-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, ok. yes, anything that is massively liquidated will have a volatile price during this time

[24-Oct-19 12:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Mihailo wrote `When the ratio of the system reaches some high value (let's say 60%) then it is possible that other users liquidate accounts that have account ratio very high that we will call "red zone" (for example over 90%).` 
Do the owners of these accounts need to ask for liquidation, or will it happen automatically? Are people able to hold through the price changes, or will their pegs be auto liquidated once the price drops below a certain amount?

[24-Oct-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
when you put up collateral for a loan and the value of the collateral gets too low, what happens?

[24-Oct-19 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
does the one who took out the loan have control of the liquidation?

[24-Oct-19 12:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah that's fair. Like you said, it keeps the peg healthy by doing auto-liquidations at a certain point.

[24-Oct-19 12:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Answering my question with a question üòÇ I like it

[24-Oct-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
of course not, in exchange for borrowing against the KMD, it is locked into the system subject to liquidation. the borrower can improve his equity by depositing more KMD, or repaying some of the debt

[24-Oct-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the debt creates the pegged coins

[24-Oct-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
risk free 5% arbitrage converts back the pegged coins to KMD, with a 5% margin (to the liquidator and another 5% to the system)

[24-Oct-19 12:29 AM] jl777c#5810
in extreme cases, losses are socialized automatically across all holders of the pegged coins, proportionally

[24-Oct-19 12:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So the auto-liquidations keeps the peg working by forcing people to lower the debt amount in the overall system. Which you've just explained a couple of other ways people can reduce the debt on their holdings personally.

[24-Oct-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, people dont like to lose money for nothing

[24-Oct-19 12:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or should I say deposit to debt ratio, rather than just debts

[24-Oct-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the worst equity accounts are subject to liquidation, so those accounts are incentivized to improve their loan ratio

{Reactions}
üëç 

[24-Oct-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that aspect combined with the liquidations, improves the systems overall balance

[24-Oct-19 12:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Where does the 5% margin to the system go?

[24-Oct-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
to the system

[24-Oct-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
locked in CC address

[24-Oct-19 12:33 AM] jl777c#5810
as a specific peg is used, it will gain reserves and this is fully visible on the blockchain

[24-Oct-19 12:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
And the reserves are used to pay out on price increase?

[24-Oct-19 12:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I.e KGOLD goes from 2000 to 2200 and somebody want to cash out to KMD, the 200 comes from the reserves?

[24-Oct-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[24-Oct-19 12:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Would it be true to say that every time you buy KGOLD with KMD, your funds are locked into the same reserve?

[24-Oct-19 12:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or is that separate

[24-Oct-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by "buy"?

[24-Oct-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are buying a KGOLD, you are buying it, has nothing to do with the peg mechanism

[24-Oct-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that you could redeem the KGOLD for an ounce worth of KMD will likely make the seller want to get a price that is close to that value

[24-Oct-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
KGOLD (any pegged coin) is freely tradeable, never locked. it can be redeemed and it is backed by the pegged blockchain and its reserves

[24-Oct-19 12:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Apologies, I meant redeem.

[24-Oct-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if you redeem, you are converting a KGOLD (which is burned) into the KMD that backs it

[24-Oct-19 12:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or pegsget or pegsfund I meant even aha

[24-Oct-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the reserve is decreased by the amount redeemed, but the overall system debt is also reduced

[24-Oct-19 12:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think what I'm thinking about is if everybody was getting and then redeeming only when the price increase, the reserve funds would dwindle quick. Only to be topped up when more people get more KGOLD.

[24-Oct-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
a typical use case for this is for someone that needs some fiat, but doesnt want to sell their KMD, so they deposit 10x what they need. this gives them a 10% loan ratio, very solid and they can they pay it back to unlock all their KMD the next month., so short term loans with no interest

[24-Oct-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
supply goes down if KMD price is going down

[24-Oct-19 12:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah that is definitely a big use case. Especially for a KUSD peg

[24-Oct-19 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if the reserves are going down, so is the overall exposure, in fact the reserve ratio gets better

[24-Oct-19 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are playing with 80% loans, then 10% volatility will wipe out the 20% left, but you still have the 80% of stablecoins

[24-Oct-19 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
a more safe way to use the system is for interest free loans, at a low exposure. if at 10%, price would need to drop 80%+ before you are in danger of being liquidated

[24-Oct-19 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and such a drop historically is taking literally years to happen, not in a single day

[24-Oct-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly, if over a year the price is dropping, the total amount of issued pegged coins must reduce

[24-Oct-19 12:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yea that makes sense. Is the reserve purely for a single peg, or for all pegs?
In terms of other use cases, could people trade crypto-backed commodities?

[24-Oct-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a dedicated blockchain per peg

[24-Oct-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so the reserves for that peg will be locked into that blockchain

[24-Oct-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang the prior pages should give a good amount of info on how the pegs work. hopefully you can document it so it is clearer than the current wiki page

[24-Oct-19 01:02 AM] allbits#5898
As I understand it the effective interest rate will not be zero because one would be giving up rewards. So on the highest possible loan (80%), I'm effectively paying 6.25%

In the example of only taking 10% of locked KMD as a loan my effective interest rate is 50%

Do I have that right?

[24-Oct-19 01:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks for shedding some light on pegs jl.

[24-Oct-19 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
@allbits assuming that you are collected rewards 100% of the time, yes you do give that up. i think for short term loans, it makes sense. not sure for long term loans. it could be a way to cashout at 80% of marketprice without needing to sell, or having any counterparty
