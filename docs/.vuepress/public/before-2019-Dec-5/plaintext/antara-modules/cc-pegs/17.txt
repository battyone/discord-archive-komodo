yes, at first it wont be much, but if we get significant deposits, it could be important to be properly supported

[18-Nov-19 10:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
So I remeber that you need to move the funds at least once a month in order to be able to claim rewards.

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
after one month, the rewards stop increasing for a specific utxo

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
YEs

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
That I meant

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so not claiming monthly, loses rewards

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can claim more often, just not so often to have txfees dominate

[18-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
Right

[18-Nov-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is complex enough, the withdraw process. maybe the rewards claiming is done totally separately

[18-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Mihailo#5902
So we need to watch about two things. One is to be able to claim rewards (so I have to check that locktime thing) and the other that utxos are not over 30 days old

[18-Nov-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if a claim is being done, the withdraw cant be done

[18-Nov-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
for withdraws, you want to make sure the utxo is less than an hour old. that way you lose no rewards

[18-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm

[18-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
"if a claim is being done, the withdraw cant be done", you mean at that moment or after?

[18-Nov-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo used for a claim, cant also be in a withdraw

[18-Nov-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, after the claim is done, it can be used for withdraw

[18-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[18-Nov-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe there is a mutually exclusive mode for the msig signers, periods where they are doing claims and separately doing withdraws

[18-Nov-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a non-consensus thing, but still important part of the system

[18-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, we can set some short period when they are claiming rewards and in that period withdraws won't work. But if I understand correct that period can be short. Just tx to claim rewards and move utxo to new one?

[18-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
I'm not too much familiar with reward system

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it can just be something done once per hour to check to see if any rewards should be claimed

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no actual rewards system

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just blockchain rules

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you spend a utxo that is over an hour old and more than 10 KMD and has locktime set, then you can spend more than the utxo value

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the value increases at 5% rate, but stops growing after a month

[18-Nov-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
THAT is the entire "system"

[18-Nov-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
people then are motivated to spend monthly or more frequently to collect the rewards, but it is fully up to each address owner

[18-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, I saw that default for createrawtransaction is locktime set to 0. So this means that txs created with that RPC by default can't get rewards, so you must set locktime?

[18-Nov-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
if locktime isnt sent, it wont be eligible

[18-Nov-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
set it to 6 minutes in the past, should work well

[18-Nov-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you can sum the amount of interest you can claim, from the listunspent output

[18-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
So some dapps that are using createrawtransaction and not setting locktime cannot take rewards. I mean there are probably someone that doesn't know they can use this.

[18-Nov-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
just increase the total you are spending by the sum of interest fields

[18-Nov-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are using createrawtransaction, it is assumed you know what you are doing

[18-Nov-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant be claiming rewards hourly as that resets the counter, and there is not interest for the first hour

[18-Nov-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it should be that if doing a withdraw requires using utxo with significant amounts of rewards accrued, the msig signers would do a rewards claim first

[18-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
And what locktime is default for sendtoaddress?

[18-Nov-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i think 777 seconds in the past

[18-Nov-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so the check for accrued interest becomes part of the withdraw process

[18-Nov-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and after 3 weeks, can have some background claiming process

[18-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, claiming reward can also be part of withdraw? You spend the utxo by giving the amount to user and adding the interest to vins and having change back to deposit address?

[18-Nov-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it could, but then it would need to have locktime set

[18-Nov-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in the event it doesnt get broadcast within an hour, it will expire

[18-Nov-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that is not a very common occurance, so if you take into account failed withdraws due to expiration (ie. even if properly signed, if it takes too long, it wont be valid) then we can indeed combine the withdraw with claiming

[18-Nov-19 11:00 AM] Mihailo#5902
And if we need to have locktime set it needs to be at least 1 hour?

[18-Nov-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean "at least 1 hour"

[18-Nov-19 11:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
On how much locktime needs to be set?

[18-Nov-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
locktime must be > mediantimepast, which is about 10 minutes ago

[18-Nov-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it cant be in the future

[18-Nov-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a 10 minutes of valid values

[18-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, than I'm confused what locktime represents

[18-Nov-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but, there is an additional check in KMD that prevents locktime more than an hour old

[18-Nov-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
just imagine locktime to mean "now", approximately

[18-Nov-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
cant set it too far back in time, and cant set it in the future

[18-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
I thought locktime indicates the earliest time or earliest block when that transaction may be added to the block chain.

[18-Nov-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Nov-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the specific check is against the median time past, so the time of 9 blocks ago

[18-Nov-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD had to add a restriction of "no more than one hour old" to prevent back dating a tx to gain rewards

[18-Nov-19 11:05 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, so if we set locktime to now we have approx. 9 blocks for tx to enter and then it expires?

[18-Nov-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if you set it to now, it will be valid for an hour

[18-Nov-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but depending on the miner that sets the blocktime, it might not be accepted (if it ends up being after the miners blocktime), so setting it to the recent past is the safest and still gives 50+ minutes to confirm

[18-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Mihailo#5902
I don't get the calc but never mind. So in order to KISS, we can expire a withdraw after an hour or so to make the invalid withdraws expire and also the valid ones if they didn't finished in hour it means someting is wrong. And this way we can also use claiming rewards as a part of withdraw. BTW, the chains that uses gateways (any variant) should need to have notarization as without it regardless of this limitation it will be bad UX to wait for 100 confs before it can sign it and broadcast it.

[18-Nov-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

@Mihailo plz review the docs for accuracy

[19-Nov-19 01:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, np.

[20-Nov-19 10:15 AM] Mihailo#5902
@gcharang I have read the documents, here are my remarks.
Intro:
- "To prevent their deposit from being liquidated, the user can either return some of the USDK coins or deposit more tokenized KMD to maintain a good debt ratio."  -> user must either cover whole debt or deposit more KMD, there is no partial return
- In Pegs Anatar Module Flow, I would add a step where user deposits external crypto into tokens

User tutorial:
- Add the part between KMD deposit and gateway deposit: You must wait for the block where the KMD tx is mined to be submitted to oracle. This can be checkd using oraclessamples call to fetch for exmaple last 5 data entries and check if the height is more or equal to the heigth of the KMD block where the tx is.

Craetor tutorial:
- The synthetic price won't work as it is refering to KMD and the external chain used is KMDTEST. Basically everything must match: external coin name, name in synthetic, token name and oracle name!

@jl777c One more thing regarding locktime. As users that are depositing use z_sendmany to send to deposit address, I think locktime isn't set there. So we must initially spend the utxo to set locktime and then it can stay for accumulating reward?
This is all ofc for KMD chain only, as others don't have rewards...

[20-Nov-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i had thought z_sendmany set locktime. can people use sendmany?

[20-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ha, you are correct. Locktime is set in z_sendmany. 
Yes, we have used z_sendmany as deposit tx in all tutorials from the start. I don't know why that was but I inherited it when I start working on gateways.

[20-Nov-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
probably because z_sendmany can specify a source address

[20-Nov-19 11:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I remebered now.

[20-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I have one dilema. When you make the withdraw and it is broadcasted on external chain, than that utxo won't show in listunspent until tx is mined. Currently I have posted deposit address balance to oracle by using listunspent. On my test chain I had just one utxo so when withdraw is broadcasted I don't have any more utxo so the balance is 0. My question is, should I check the mempool also to see if there are some vouts that goes to deposit address? (it might catch also deposit tx and count those for balance too)

[20-Nov-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
in non-consensus code, you can scan mempool for balance calcs

[20-Nov-19 04:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
This is basically check in oraclefeed. And it will post it to oracle along with block data. And then in rpc and validation the balance will be checked from oracle to see if the withdraw tx can be created for given amount

[20-Nov-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, yes, use the mempool info. you are doing a majority test, so it should match in most of the nodes

[20-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe make the oracle have confirmed and uncomfirmed balance?

[20-Nov-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
that way, a discrepancy in the mempool info can be somehow accounted for

[29-Nov-19 02:55 PM] SHossain#0007
We have new MBTCTEST chain for those who are testing. Please delete old komodo source dir, data dir. Clone fresh, compile as per the guide and start the KMD & MBTCTEST chain. You should be able to make multiple withdraws, but they will be processed serialized (one by one). The withdraw should complete fast as after withdraw tx is confrimed it will be signed and broadcasted immediatelly. So you can check on your KMD node with `getunconfirmedbalance` to see it before the block is mined!
Initial Guide: https://gist.github.com/himu007/5b61ebb330ee46c4c1f7518d34e30d42
Break the system if you can with your testing power.

the new `bindtxid` on MBTCTEST chain is `564027c872ee30a82aa9ce7b2f6a5041669d4b63ea9d86d7253c4b773fce22ab`. easily identifiable from the chain start param where it appears as `-earlytxid`

[29-Nov-19 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
@CHMEX please update the explorer with fresh clone of komodo and with fresh data dir as per the guide above when you get some time. `git pull` will not work.

[29-Nov-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mihailo my KMD deposit tx has 20 confirms, but, can't get it imported into MBTCTEST. getting this error
```

are your systems online?

[29-Nov-19 03:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
They should be, let me check.

[29-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
On one node KMD is not running, on the other oraclefeed is not running. I'll check it out, but can't do it now as some virus is breaking me and I don't feel well. I'll let you know when I fix it.

[29-Nov-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007

[29-Nov-19 03:49 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll wait

[30-Nov-19 08:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
It seems there is a memory leak on oraclefeed, so I'll have to figure it out where it is.

[30-Nov-19 09:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
Found it and fixed it. I think nodes will be running fine now.

[30-Nov-19 03:32 PM] SHossain#0007
The last deposit i've done yesterday, still can't import it

[30-Nov-19 04:48 PM] SHossain#0007
new deposits are working fine

[30-Nov-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we dont have support for recovering missed deposits (yet)

[30-Nov-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when we do, there is already a missed deposit that should be found

[30-Nov-19 04:50 PM] SHossain#0007
it's fine for now. the multisig account has those deposits. so, withdrawing wouldn't be an issue as we have more funds in there üôÇ
