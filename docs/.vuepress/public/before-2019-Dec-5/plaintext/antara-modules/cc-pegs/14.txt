Would be cool to deposit to two different addresses, and then send total amount to single address and try withdraw all that you have

[01-Nov-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
please come up with more test scenarios like this, so we can be sure it is 100% solid

[01-Nov-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain plz document the list of tests so we dont forget, in some single place for description of tests, i guess link to the pegs wiki

i had other addresses with mined funds. i combined them together on the address that i'm running the MBTCTEST daemon with. couldn't withdraw mined funds

[01-Nov-19 06:30 PM] SHossain#0007
i was only allowed to withdraw which i ONLY deposited

[01-Nov-19 06:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
That's what I thought now

[01-Nov-19 06:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
But I think there is no check of how much funds is on the deposit address. So it could be we could make a withdraw which would not be able to process.

[01-Nov-19 06:33 PM] SHossain#0007
will do this one now `deposit to two different addresses, and then send total amount to single address and try withdraw all that you have`

the previous withdraw tx hasn't been deposited yet into my KMD wallet. has 20 confs https://mbtctest.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/663de8b1d7816534a54dce61abcf2a34f8f6e1c353eff652f3a224986c5e6f04

[01-Nov-19 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
might take some more time. just reporting in

[01-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahh, one of my signing nodes is unreachable

[01-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is my local server at the office. It is late here and I can't go now to the office. I'll reboot it tomorrow morning.

[01-Nov-19 07:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
I see that one node signed the withdraw!

[01-Nov-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. no worries

[01-Nov-19 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
i've added few list of test cases here https://gist.github.com/himu007/5b61ebb330ee46c4c1f7518d34e30d42#test-cases

[01-Nov-19 08:16 PM] SHossain#0007
once i get more cases, i can add them and can create a separate section if needed

[01-Nov-19 08:18 PM] SHossain#0007

hopefully in the morning i can process the next one

[01-Nov-19 08:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
You will, I'll reboot it first thing in the morining

[01-Nov-19 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
i wonder what does this RPC call does? `importgatewayprocessed`

[01-Nov-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
`importgatewaypendingwithdraws` shows the pending ones

[01-Nov-19 08:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
As I mentioned, it shows withdraws that are completely signed but not yet done on external chain.

[01-Nov-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
ah, sorry. understood correctly now

[01-Nov-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks again

[01-Nov-19 08:34 PM] SHossain#0007
this is a whole new chapter for KMD ecosystem üôÇ

[02-Nov-19 01:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, can I try out Pegs?

[02-Nov-19 09:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, but we don't currently have a doc on how to set it up and use it.

[02-Nov-19 10:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I'll see if I can get somewhere with it.

[02-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain We got to a problem that KMD tx that was signed has expired:
```error code: -26
error message:
16: tx-overwinter-expired
```
I thought that I addressed this issue with setting expiry to something long, but it seems I didn't fixed it.

[02-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
I can cancel this withdraw with making markdone tx, but you won't get the funds.

[02-Nov-19 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. no worries

[02-Nov-19 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
it was 0.01 KMD only üôÇ

[02-Nov-19 12:24 PM] Mihailo#5902

[02-Nov-19 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
glad that this issue is identified while one of your node was offline

[02-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, basically because my node signed it now it passed the exipry height and is no longer valid

[02-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
I discarded the withdraw.

[02-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
You can try now if you want the aggregate test.

[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] SHossain#0007
while starting the chain, i got this now on the console output

It is probably some tx on your node that didn't got transmitted, so it trying to resend it

[02-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
And what is your balance?

[02-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Mihailo#5902

@CrisF if you like to test, let me know. i can help if needed with current testing setup

[02-Nov-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
you need KMD and MBTCTEST chain. the step/guides are here https://gist.github.com/himu007/5b61ebb330ee46c4c1f7518d34e30d42

[02-Nov-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
you specifically need to compile using the steps mentioned on that gist

[02-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain That is not pegs üòâ That is import gateway. Pegs are UDSKTEST...

[02-Nov-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry, yes.

[02-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe it would be good to rename this CC to sidechain CC and create a separate channel for it?

[02-Nov-19 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
you want a `cc-importgateway` channel?

[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] SHossain#0007
or `cc-sidechain`?

[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Mihailo#5902
It's not just a channel, but I think import gateway CC is a confusing name.

[02-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, you withdraw has been broadcasted  to KMD

{Reactions}
shexy 

[02-Nov-19 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
you can change the name if you like. i don't have any issues with that üôÇ

[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
so, that means, combining balance from different address and withdrawing works

[02-Nov-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
these burn txs are pretty cool (from yesterday) https://mbtctest.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/308757db90ca20c4afad255ba31213124ff37434b14d2bbdf308d16b06c32167

[02-Nov-19 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
and, yes, i received my funds back on KMD chain  https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/a56891271a15f9109d282a49af76f15603e4bfb7af72c37b84c856582fa86f68

[02-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Mihailo#5902
Those txs are deposit tx where import is used. Import txs are really wierd!

[02-Nov-19 12:45 PM] SHossain#0007
yep, that's what i was thinking

[02-Nov-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess we have seen that during a scaletest and testing on LABS

[02-Nov-19 12:47 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think I saw few things that can go wrong on this flow, so I need to address them

[02-Nov-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. can you please send 1 or 2 MBTCTEST coins here `RTQ7GDHsnHZ4njDbTjUnmm8GCkRhjifFES` when you have time?

[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, i have to start mining 0.0001 blocks :abusedsmily:

[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll send it right now

[02-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
Sent

[02-Nov-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks. i want to see if i can withdraw that

[02-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
You cannot but let see if it is going to tell you or make the withdraw and get it stuck

[02-Nov-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
it would be interesting to see nevertheless

[02-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
This is the balance of gateway:
```"bKEBwCtejNynumGH7qP2rXF67Z3Hk4LVkd",
      0.09020000,
```

[02-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
So try 0.1 if you want

0.05 seems working

[02-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
Probably it will create withdraw and wont be able to withdraw it on KMD

[02-Nov-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
shall i broadcast the hex?

[02-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
This is the problem as MBTCTEST and KMD have no information on each other.

[02-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
The bridge for those two is oraclefeed

0.1 also provides me hex

[02-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
And it works with both chains. So it would need to have some way tha MBTCTEST can know the balance of KMD gateway deposit address

[02-Nov-19 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
of course the last one will be rejected

[02-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Everything will work as long you have balance

[02-Nov-19 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007
broadcasted the 0.05 value tx

[02-Nov-19 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007
let see

[02-Nov-19 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
I will monitor logs

[02-Nov-19 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
It won't be able to create tx

[02-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe it will even be stuck so I would need to fork the chain

[02-Nov-19 12:55 PM] SHossain#0007
i will put bit more KMD into gateway if needed
