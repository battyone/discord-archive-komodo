Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

yeah, I was testing earlier to get http://oracle.earth/oracles_data/ converter working with those formats, so far so good

[28-May-19 12:45 PM] Mihailo#5902
Basically all four formats will be printed in string like this: `sprintf(str,"%lld",(long long)val);`

[28-May-19 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
didnt try float tho, glad I asked first

[28-May-19 12:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
Or `sprintf(str,"%llu",(long long)uval);` for unsigned....

[28-May-19 12:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
So it will be integer representation

[28-May-19 12:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
havnet tested signed yet, about to try that

[28-May-19 12:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
autotests have it working tho

[28-May-19 12:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just need to make sure my conversion script is sane

@jl777c @TonyL @Alright @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 
I've made a PR of oracles changes. Please make complete test to check if it does not break anything. First test with current timestamp does oracles works as they did up to now. Nothing should change (except oraclesamples that were changed to take baton address instead of txid). Then change PUBKEY_SPOOFING_FIX_ACTIVATION to timestamp before now (for example 1558359845) to see how it will work after July 15th, and check existing oracle with fix activated if nothing breaks (data, subscribe, new registers....)

Just to be sure that it working fine on non-regtest stuff too

[29-May-19 09:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

tested multiformat pre and post activation, samples returned after activation fine, no `oracelsfund` required on the pre-activation oracle after activation. ran a few other maual tests, no issues found. Only thing worth mention but not at all a problem was that `oraclesfund` could be repeated after already being done.

[29-May-19 01:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so activation appears to have no ill effect on pre activation oracles or the data they hold within

Which branch has the new stuff?

[07-Jun-19 02:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
FSM, but using timestamp for activation. Need to edit ~/komodo/src/cc.oracles.cpp

[07-Jun-19 02:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
change `#define PUBKEY_SPOOFING_FIX_ACTIVATION 1558455503
` to a timestamp in past, then rebuild

[07-Jun-19 06:08 AM] Mylo#8306
is "using timestamps" necessary?

[07-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Mylo#8306
if i'm launching a new smart chain, do i care about this?   or is this for backwards compat with existing launched FSM branches?

[07-Jun-19 06:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
The changes will be applied at the July 15th hardfork timestamp. 
There is a new RPC `oraclesfund` after the hardfork which needs to be run before you can subscribe/register

[07-Jun-19 06:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
The other change is that `oraclesdata` will use `baton`, which is a registered publisher's R-address, instead of the `batonutxo` which is currently used

[07-Jun-19 06:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so if you want to test the changes, you need to build with a modified timestamp so it is activated.

[07-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Mylo#8306

[18-Jun-19 03:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what would be the best way to retrieve historical samples in oracles after `oraclesamples` uses `baton` instead of `batonutxo`?
with `batonutxo`, you can find the latest using `oraclesinfo`, and get x number of datapoints back. You can also use an old `batonutxo` to find samples from a specific batonutxo back. 
it seems that `baton` defaults to the latest entry. If I want samples for a time period, is there a recommended way to retrieve just that, without also filtering out everything that happened since then?

[18-Jun-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
record the latest baton at specific time periods, encode the sample number in the data also

[18-Jun-19 07:19 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I noticed similar problem few days ago, that you cannot fetch specific data tx as with oraclesamples you would need to get all data and then iterate through it. So we added oraclesample RPC that returns data from single data tx. When I made it I was thinking do we need also to fetch number of txs but decided to implement single tx. If it is very convenient to have fetching x txs from specific tx we can add it easily...

[18-Jun-19 07:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
great, I'll test that out. I can see lookback from tx being handy, but I can work with single sample at the moment. I assume getting a list of tx related to the oracle baton address shouldnt be too difficult? from there can just loop over a subset of the list

[18-Jun-19 07:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
pls let me know when ready to test out which branch / repo etc and I can add that RPC to our autotests & docs

[22-Jun-19 08:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Would it be difficult to add a "utxo count" output to `oraclesinfo`
to send multiple `oraclesdata` in same block, oracle needs more than one utxo (e.g. 10utxo by running `oraclessubscribe` 10 times).
utxo count output can show what its rate capacity per block is.

Also wondering if/how oracle response may be affected by the cumulative transactions it has been involved in. With addresses in wallet.dat, we can use `cleanwallettransactions` to speed up RPCs that communicate with wallet. 
Are oracle baton addresses similarly affected or able to be cleaned?

[22-Jun-19 07:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Such data points amount indication sounds like an useful addition

[25-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
I think we can show utxo count easily, let me just check are there any difficulties...

`An oracle is to blame
Essentially, oracles are used in blockchains to verify real word information and then report back the finding to the blockchain, triggering an implementation of smart contracts. In this case, a Synthetix oracle, responsible for providing external data to Synthetix‚Äôs smart contracts, transmitted false data on June 25, which a bot took advantage of.`

How are the pubkeys not the same?

[16-Sep-19 02:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
@redp1ll You must do a register from a node that is ran with -pubkey= as the one you want to register!

[16-Sep-19 02:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
Also you must do oralcesfund first on order to prove that you are the owner of pubkey.

[16-Sep-19 02:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
This was done in order to prevent others to register a pubkey that they do not own!

[16-Sep-19 03:07 PM] redp1ll#3268
@Mihailo I'm running the 2 node setup on one machine with different .conf files and run both nodes with -pubkey= option. I did the oraclesfund before that too

[16-Sep-19 03:19 PM] Mihailo#5902
I see that you are using the same pubkey on both nodes, so I suppose that they do not have private keys for that pubkey on both?

[16-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
Usually you ran the node with pubkey which you have in your wallte on that node. You can run the node with some other pubkey, but then you are not able to sign transaction which need privatekey for that pubkey on that node.

[16-Sep-19 03:22 PM] redp1ll#3268
I actually importprivkey for both nodes

[16-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Mihailo#5902

I've hit an issue when reindexing one of my chains
`CC Eval EVAL_ORACLES Invalid: unexpected OraclesValidate for register spending tx 3cb077f66c9b56a56ce8f586cd6af7b6ef9e7b6c51c42ca8a12b6945b5db903f

once this happens, it wont progress to next block. Is there a way to fix or overcome this?

[30-Sep-19 07:18 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Hmmm, it may be the fix for pubkey spoofing. But it is time activated. Can you give more details on register tx, when is the block in which is that tx and etc.

I can run the chain by using a bootstrap from another node, but was trying to reindex to get addressindex/spentindex up for explorer.

[30-Sep-19 07:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if its not an easyfix, I can kill the chain and start again, I think I'm the only one running it unless someone in LABs still is also. Working on an oracles_export script now to migrate existing data if it comes to that (it holds all data for display on https://oracle.earth/).

[30-Sep-19 09:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, some how that refister tx is spending CC vout and there was no spending of CC vout in register until the spoofing fix. The date of the block is June 14th but the fix starts at July 15th.

[30-Sep-19 09:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
I`ll sync the chain to see the tx itself

[30-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Or if you can paste me the decoded tx that fails would be even better.

[30-Sep-19 09:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, I have synced the chain. I see the tx. Let me check

[30-Sep-19 09:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator This is strange. The tx seems to be oraclesfund tx, but it is in time when spoofing fix is not active. Still I don't know yet how it complained about unexpected oraclesvalidate for register!

[30-Sep-19 09:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
Are you sure the time is correct on nodes running that chain?

[30-Sep-19 09:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah time is correct. Could my fault for tesing the oraclesfund rpc before spoofing fix activation (I recall changing the activation time at some stage to prepare for the change, but thought it was on a different chain). I'll see if I can get decoded tx, though I might not have that wallet active anymore

[30-Sep-19 09:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
Even if you tested fund before it shouldn't complain. I'm totaly confused how the CC validation is triggered when there is no CC input spent @jl777c

[30-Sep-19 10:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ah, no. It is a problem of spending tx 3cb077f66c9b56a56ce8f586cd6af7b6ef9e7b6c51c42ca8a12b6945b5db903f, so it is probably register that is failing...

[30-Sep-19 10:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Could be the problem that you did fund and register before the fix active. But we should also prevent that the chain is stuck...

[30-Sep-19 10:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Most likely cause is premature activation, testing rpc, then changing activation back to actual.

[30-Sep-19 10:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, that is it.

[30-Sep-19 10:06 AM] Mihailo#5902
I've commented the else in oraclesregister validation and it passes

[30-Sep-19 10:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
So basically this shouldn't happen, but for example if anybody was sending the fund and register before the fix activation (for example he creates the tx manually) it could break the sync of the chain.

[30-Sep-19 10:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c This is very unlikely but should we do something about this?

if it can be worked around, that seems sufficient

[30-Sep-19 10:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
You can comment the else part in register validation and it will pass. But without code change it cannot be worked around.

[30-Sep-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean, is this specific oracle so important? can a new one be made as a replacement

[30-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, the problem is if someone made and oracle with fund/register tx before the pubkey spoofing fix was activated (this could only be done when moving the time activation or manually creating a tx), then it will stuck the chain sync. But this is very unlikely that someone has done on production chain!

[30-Sep-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so can we ignore this? it seems it cant be done anymore and is only for legacy instances?

Hi, I have a non-tech general question about Oracles (in general).
I've been to some conferences and presentations, and met quite a few seemingly smart people recently.  They all seem to be waiting for, or recently developed an oracle.
We tested this in Labs over 1 year ago.  Seems quite old.
What am I missing?
