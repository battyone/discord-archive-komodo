The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle.

[10-May-19 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
ie maybe when registering, it never used the new baton from new register?

[10-May-19 11:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or it always used new one, but there was never any data before last register...

[10-May-19 11:29 AM] Alright#0419
there are quite a few chains in production with oracles CC, changing behavior of oraclesregister to make sure there is only ever a single baton is a hard fork. Probably best to fork it with the NN hardfork or shortly after if we have to hard fork it

[10-May-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
maybe it can be fixed rpc side though, ie ignore any new batons, don't show them in oraclesinfo

[10-May-19 11:32 AM] Mihailo#5902
I would propose we do not make a change, but basically show batons for each register, so you can get all data if oyu want by iterating all registers from oraclesinfo and calling oraclssamples for each baton.

[10-May-19 11:33 AM] Alright#0419
I think that works, have to make sure oraclesdata will use the correct baton though

[10-May-19 11:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
It works, but for two registers of the same pubkey it shows latest baton in both

[10-May-19 11:34 AM] Mihailo#5902
for two different publishers it shows different batons, but for the same pubkey it will show same one in each register

[10-May-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
isn't that the behavior right now?

[10-May-19 11:34 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[10-May-19 11:35 AM] Alright#0419
the problem is that oraclesinfo "forgets" about the other set of batons

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
Same publisher, two registers but shows same baton. I propose that we show the baton for first register until that one was used, and then for 2nd....

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
now that I think of it, yes this always existed

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
Was why I was having so much trouble with chat history üòÇ

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
that just clicked in my head üòÇ

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
what you're saying makes sense

[10-May-19 11:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or either, show one (the latest) but we need to spend previous baton when making new one and connecti ti in opret so when making oraclessamples to show all data

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
But this is hardfork change

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
well the whole ecosystem is hard forking in about a month

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or maybe not ü§î

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
so we could use that to our advantage

[10-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
after elections we'll be pushing "update before June ~15th"

[10-May-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
if we need to hard fork oracles, we should get the code included in the repo prior to us pushing that messaging

[10-May-19 11:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
Lets see what @jl777c thinks....

[10-May-19 11:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe he has some insight we are missing

[10-May-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
if hard forking can give us objectively better functionality(not saying it will), I think we should do it. Piggy back on the election hard fork

[10-May-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
but again, I don't think it's necessary. If oraclesinfo can show all sets of batons, the problem goes away(I think)

[10-May-19 11:44 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or I can change oraclessamples to go deep to the first register, this would'nt be hardfork change

[10-May-19 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
so only ever show a single set of batons?

[10-May-19 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand

[10-May-19 11:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, just latest baton and go through all. Let me check if it is doable

[10-May-19 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
requires changes to oraclesdata to make sure that baton is used

[10-May-19 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
also takes away functionality of being able to change data fee

[10-May-19 11:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, but when oraclessamples reaches oracleregister it requires to know previous tx before register, so probably not....

[10-May-19 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
I don't think the changing data fee is all that important tbh, could just reference a new pubkey with the very last oraclesdata to change data fee

[10-May-19 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
"I've increased my price. You can find me at <pubkey> now."

[10-May-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i totally forgot all the details of oracles CC

[10-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
plz fix it if it is broken

[10-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
dont hardfork existing chains

[10-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it can be just non-consensus rpc calls to fix

[10-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or new variants if it will break installed base

[10-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i cannot forsee all edge cases ahead of time

[10-May-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
ok so I thought if I got all baton txids from baton addr shown in oraclesinfo, I'd be able to use oraclessamples on each and have it return all valuess

[10-May-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
this doesn't seem to be the case, seems it's more an issue with oraclessamples than anything else

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL there are two txs you made on the 20vs22 oracle that oraclessamples can't seem to decode

[10-May-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
hold on, can get the txids

[10-May-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
did you do anything wonky for those two?

[10-May-19 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
Oh maybe the hex length was just messed up on them?

[10-May-19 02:13 PM] Alright#0419
```
{'result': 'success', 'samples': []}

```
these two

[10-May-19 02:22 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure what are these transactions. Maybe I've sent some incorrect data hex in these.

For  "I want 666 nodes" I have baton which no match any of two above: 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKORC oraclessamples 68c78190c91f45d7dacff72281226a075a9a14f0ea60efd4edda15c6edea947a 8c6cdb43722ba32c8928507876f9a5e641957e196c3eee99ee9883e445c65dd0 3

    ]
  ]
}```

 Not sure about other "I want 777 nodes" message txid

[10-May-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
I'm working on a work around for NNvote dapp right now, is definitely convoluted as it iterates over all txids from baton addr, but it should work

[10-May-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
proves that it can be fixed via rpc

@Mihailo don't think this is all that helpful in fixing it, but it proves that it can be fixed via RPC I believe. I'm basically just checking oraclessamples on each EVAL_ORACLES 'D' tx to the baton address

[11-May-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
and it works

[11-May-19 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how it currently tracks samples, but maybe something similar can be done via rpc.

[11-May-19 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
ie, check all txids to baton address

[11-May-19 12:11 PM] Alright#0419
Ah I just realized that's flawed as I could likely hack oraclesdata to use someone else's baton address ü§î

[11-May-19 12:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
I will show latest baton for each register in oraclesinfo, and then you can issue oraclessamples with correct baton to see all data for that baton.

[11-May-19 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
sounds good üëç

[11-May-19 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
just needed something in the mean time for that vote dapp

[11-May-19 12:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmm, I could maybe even pass all txs that goes to baton address as you said and show data that way...

[11-May-19 12:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
But still, I'll probably get on it at monday

[13-May-19 01:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright @TonyL @jl777c I have made a fix for oracles so that oraclessamples now display all data from one publisher, never mind how many registers he done. The input for oraclesamples is baton address instead of latest baton txid. Also, I changed the display in oraclesinfo to show only one (latest) register per publisher.

As all data posted have baton sent to batonaddress. So with SetCCtxids I can get all txs sent to this address, and that is all data ever sent

@Mihailo Awesome üòÉ I'll try to get to it today, but if I can't, won't be able to play with it until Thursday or so

[13-May-19 02:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, just checkout on some oracles the samples to see if you are getting it. We can merge it to FSM later ;)

[13-May-19 05:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright It may print double txs for each data, have to check tomorrow.
