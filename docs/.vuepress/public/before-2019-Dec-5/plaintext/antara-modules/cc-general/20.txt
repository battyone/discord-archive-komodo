for each vin do the above to get the rawtx. find the corresponding output

[27-Jul-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont understand rawtx fully, you will make mistakes

[27-Jul-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt that hard, just a bit tedious

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so for each input there is a txid/out, get the value and address

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
for each output, it is much easier, as you just get it from the tx JSON

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] Alright#0419
Is insight likely to work? I do understand raw txs for the most part, I just feel like I'm going in circles while looking at these raw txs >.<

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can list all the inputs alongside the outputs

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
please listen to what I suggest

[27-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
insight wont know about the new CC outputs

[27-Jul-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe it will if it uses the latest

[27-Jul-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
stop going in circles

[27-Jul-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
do it for one rawtx and it will become much clearer

[27-Jul-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
vin0: x -> addr
vin1: y -> addr2
vin2: z-> addr3
vout0: A -> outaddr0
vout1: B -> outaddr1
txfee -> miner

[27-Jul-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
one you reduce a tx to the above, then i dont think you will be circling much

[27-Jul-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
ok, tokenbid tx looks totally normal

[27-Jul-18 10:24 AM] Alright#0419
100k ATEST vin 
20 ATEST vout to CC address 
99979.99990000 ATEST vout to change address
op_return vout

[27-Jul-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
good. much easier when reduced to that form

[27-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
tokenbidfill 
normal 100k ATEST vin0
vout0 of tokenbid tx vin1  (20 ATEST)
vout3 of a tokentrasfer tx (7777767 assets) vin2

0 sat cryptocondition to CC address vout0
20 ATEST to pubkey address that did tokenfillbid vout1
20 tokens to RPbmcj1sJqh3K1RXSx6ftbvAMAiEoxNG1R(?) vout2
change address(?) for tokens vout3
change address for ATEST vout4
op_return vout 5

[27-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Alright#0419
Neither of my nodes own that RPbmcj1sJqh3K1RXSx6ftbvAMAiEoxNG1R address according to validateaddress

[27-Jul-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
do a tokenaddress command, it maps normal address to CC variant

[27-Jul-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but how much was the vout3/4 for the bidfill? need all the totals to track things

[27-Jul-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
RPbmcj1sJqh3K1RXSx6ftbvAMAiEoxNG1R should be the CC address for node0

[27-Jul-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem could well be the change is too big

[27-Jul-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
need ALL the details to fully reconcile the fill

[27-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
vout 3 value": 0.07777747

[27-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
vout 4 "value": 99999.99990000

[27-Jul-18 10:37 AM] Alright#0419
RPb is token address for node0 yes

[27-Jul-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it seems all adds up to the satoshi

[27-Jul-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming the destinations for the change is correct

[27-Jul-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but how is your wallet balance not going down?

[27-Jul-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess you need to do a listunspent, maybe having CC utxo is confusing the wallet

[27-Jul-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
or do a really big swap so it wont be hard to find where the magic money is coming from

[27-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
Could it have something to do with importing those addresses found in the source code possibly?

[27-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
those were imported to node0

[27-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
going to wipe the wallet and retry this

[27-Jul-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you can listunspent and see which utxo are unexpected

[27-Jul-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
also ask/fillask are totally different code path than bid, so just because bid works doesnt mean ask will work

[27-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
scrolling through, every UTXO in listunspent is a coinbase 100K ATEST UTXO

[27-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
or well as far as I can scroll up in my terminal at least

[27-Jul-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also once rpc based bid and ask are working you can try to cheat by changing the tx created by CCassettx to be more favorable to your side and see if it gets rejected. I doubt I caught all cases of cheating

[27-Jul-18 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
curious what expected behavior is if 2 tokenbidfills are done in the same block. First one scene by the miner gets confirmed, yes?

[27-Jul-18 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
Other gets rejected as it spends the same inputs?

[27-Jul-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
need someone to place a tokenbid so I can try that with both of my nodes

[27-Jul-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
I just wiped both wallets of both nodes, going to try a bid and fillbid again

[27-Jul-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt even get into the mempool if it uses the same inputs

[27-Jul-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so we are using the mempool/confirmation double spend prevention to deal with resolving who gets the fill

[27-Jul-18 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
@Alright i have a new bid up as soon as the tx confirms `24a6b1c9773b48feaa449566ee9ebdeac9531109554369b0abe51bb62f084839`

[27-Jul-18 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
for this token `43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add`

[27-Jul-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
I want to get bid and ask 100% validated before moving onto swap as swap has a lot in common and will be much more efficient to do it after I merged in all the bid+ask fixes into swap

[27-Jul-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I have seen bid is reconciled to the satoshi, hopefully ask side will match

[27-Jul-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
then trying to cheat via CCassettx.c changes and at that point I think it is pretty much ready for GUIfication

[27-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
so I accidentally just placed a bid for a token that doesn't exist on this chain, shows up in the orderbook, but if I try to cancel it, I get 
```

[27-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
not a bid deal, but it's going to be in the orderbook forever it seems

[27-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
