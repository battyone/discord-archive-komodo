i guess the danger is if it passes when it shouldnt that one time it is checked...

[20-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every transaction passes the mempoolhceck to be added at least once, except if a block is received with a transaction that is not in the local mempool, in this case it is added without being checked as the block validation checks all the transactions have inputs already.

[20-Dec-18 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but someone should try to break it

[20-Dec-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am more confident of th changes to the staker, those are definatly safe as no consensus things are change there.

@blackjok3r i have never used that editor, but it's probably called something like "strip trailing whitespace"

[21-Dec-18 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, you can append `?w=1` to ignore whitespace in diffs in Github: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1119/files?w=1

equivalent to ```     -w, --ignore-all-space
           Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none.

@Mihailo Seems I've faced bug in ChannelsCC: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/hc7zQxtp8w/
When sending payment which covers channel capacity fully throwing an error: ```CC Eval EVAL_CHANNELS Invalid: vout.0 is CC for channelPayment! spending tx 1c05abb9e5c892c8bd2e8dee9f35f27e6ddc7fc4d61e6f94b455a0c84ac75247
error code: -26
error message:
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)```

So let's say if open a channel of 10 payments max with 100000 sat denomination you'll able to send 9 payments of 100000 sat but will get an error on 10th

Or send 100000, 800000 and get an error when sending last 100000 and so on

[22-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, will take a look as soon as I'm back (I'll get back on Tuseday)

[25-Dec-18 11:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL I'm trying to reproduce the bug, but I don't seem to be able. I've opened the channel with 3 payments of 100k sat and then made 1 payment 100k, and then made another payment of 200k sat and that is total amount. Everything went through.

[25-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
Even tried your example, 100000-800000-100000

[25-Dec-18 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Hmm strange, still reproducible on my side. Are you trying to broadcast this last transaction? (I'm getting error on broadcasting)

[25-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I broadcasted it.

[25-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
So I'm left with a channel that has 0 payments left.

[26-Dec-18 10:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Should `Number of payments` be different?

[26-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
That is the number of payments in that payment. All of this were 1 payment (1000000)

[26-Dec-18 10:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see

[26-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Mihailo#5902
If you had 2000000 payment then it would be 2 payments

[26-Dec-18 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha: payment `amount` / channel `denomination`

[26-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
You can calculate like that üòâ

[26-Dec-18 10:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just an illustration for other readers üòÉ

[26-Dec-18 10:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
I can remove that info if it is confusing. There is anyway payment left.

[26-Dec-18 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, current naming might be a little bit confusing for understanding: by number of payments you can assume a separate transaction, not amount of denominations

[26-Dec-18 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
I found useful for myself made abstraction as "capacity total", "capacity left"

[26-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
For me the number of payment could be the order number of payment, but number of payments is in plural üòõ

[26-Dec-18 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, you've added `satoshi` disclaimer to `Denomination` field also (broke my app üòÇ )

[26-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah. I thought it could break something but as this info should be human readable I added "satoshi".

[26-Dec-18 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Just as a suggestion - maybe put additional information to keys?
Like a:
"Denomination (satoshi)": 100000
Instead of current:
"Denomination": "100000 satoshi"

[26-Dec-18 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
And totally agree that this disclaimer is an important here and will make understanding easier

[26-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ah, didn't think of that. Great, I'll change it in future.

Thanks for link, gonna go through it

[03-Jan-19 01:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
I just made an RPC helper function to decode OP_RETURN data from getrawtransaction for example, to see which CC and function is OP_RETURN for. Just supply txid and it will return the info about opret:
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "eval_code": "EVAL_ORACLES",
  "funciton": "D"
}
```
I had a need when debugging transactions to see if some tx is the one I'm looking for and this will help a lot.

same

Hmm seems this `jsonRPC` not defined in `/usr/local/lib/libcryptoconditions.so`

[07-Jan-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Never worked with this lib - have to try on my side for resolution

[07-Jan-19 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would help mate if solves

[07-Jan-19 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to try using this lib in my go lang code

[07-Jan-19 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also have issues compiling it on osx

[07-Jan-19 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will make issues on the repo

[07-Jan-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe lib is building for different architecture

[07-Jan-19 05:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh seems fixed it @grewalsatinder

[07-Jan-19 05:30 PM] TonyL#3577
```so.cc_jsonRPC.restype = c_char_p```

[07-Jan-19 05:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice! üôÇ

[07-Jan-19 05:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me try

[07-Jan-19 05:30 PM] TonyL#3577
```./cryptoconditions.py --help
cryptoconditions [-h] {method} {request_json}

methods:
    encodeCondition: Encode a JSON condition to binary
    decodeCondition: Decode a binary condition
    encodeFulfillment: Encode a JSON condition to a fulfillment
    decodeFulfillment: Decode a binary fulfillment
    verifyFulfillment: Verify a fulfillment
    signTreeEd25519: Sign ed25519 condition nodes
    signTreeSecp256k1: Sign secp256k1 condition nodes
    listMethods: List available methods

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit```

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
There is no `jsonRPC` in lib but `cc_jsonRPC`

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes!!

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it fixed it!!

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
So it should be just a typo

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
woohoo!! üéâ

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks @TonyL üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 05:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
