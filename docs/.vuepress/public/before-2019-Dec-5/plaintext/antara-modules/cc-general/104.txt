@TonyL I'll update channel CC manual very soon so it will be understandable how to use it.

@gcharang In this FAQ answers on conceptual questions as I can see, so it should be ok since just new CC were added but concept not changed. (if I understand correct for sure)

Might be a stupid question:
Does gateway know about assets and oracles at the source code of KMD level or the info about assets and info from oracles need to be extracted by a dAPP and sent to gateway outside of KMD source code?

[02-Oct-18 06:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Gateway binding with oracle and asset (token) on creation step:
` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewaysbind <tokenid> <oracleid> <coinname> <tokensupply> 1 1 <trustedpubkey>`
Oraclefeed dAPP grab data and publish to oracle on chain by `oraclesdata` . Then gateway using data from binded oracle for proof the deposit/withdrawal

[02-Oct-18 06:12 AM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli gatewaysdeposit bindtxid height coin cointxid claimvout deposithex proof destpub amount`
You have to declare height in your deposit call and it's checking for such height oraclized in binded oracle (not checked this part of sourcecode - I guess it's using `oraclessamples` call)

[02-Oct-18 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Not understood clear what do you mean by `outside of KMD source code`

[02-Oct-18 06:14 AM] gcharang#6833
I am not too sure either. I will have to read more and understand oracles and gateways before asking the correct questions

[02-Oct-18 06:17 AM] TonyL#3577

I think what I was trying to ask was: 
Does the `komodod` when using gateways cc, access the oracle data that is there in the blockchain by itself or does the gateways cc (komodod) need to be fed the oracle data from the outside?(Like through a rpc call)
Looking at the command you posted above, it seems that we just need to give the `oracleid`  to gateways and komodod will access the data by itself from the blockchain

[02-Oct-18 07:22 AM] TonyL#3577
gatewaysCC access the data by itself from the blockchain (oracleCC) when you doing calls which require such data. Data from outside to blockchain (to oracle) "grabbing" by `oraclefeed` dAPP

im testing the gateways cc cli interface, it looks awesome, but im not sure about what to do with it

how can i test for example to buy a token and redeem the coins within

[02-Oct-18 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers hi and thanks for a feedback! At the moment only possible to prepare the gateway for transactions:
```[0] Create token
[1] Get list of availiable tokens
[2] Create oracle
[3] Oracle subscription UTXOs generator
[4] Get list of availiable oracles
[5] Tokens converter
[6] Bind gateway```

Is it possible to use ltc already?

[02-Oct-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
any bitcoin protocol coin with a gateway can be used, but for now KMD as the deposit address generation is making KMD addresses

[02-Oct-18 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure why someone created token with name `LTC` üòÉ  wasn't me

[02-Oct-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to convert it to LTC address by unconverting the base58, changing prefix and reconverting to LTC base58

[02-Oct-18 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
I've tried to call on 2 nodes - on node who made `gatewaydeposit` and on node who have to receive tokens

[02-Oct-18 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
No luck on both

[02-Oct-18 12:27 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess I'm missing something conceptual when choosing pubkeys.
` To make a gateway deposit, send the funds to the "deposit" address, along with any amount to the same pubkey address you want to get the assetized KMD to appear in.`
But I want to see assetized KMD on my ORCL1 address and I have different pubkeys for KMD and ORCL1 chains

[02-Oct-18 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
So if I'm choosing address which I get for ORCL1 in z_sendmany (same pubkey address I ant to get assetized KMD appear in) - I received tokens in ORCL1 but KMD went to "somewhere" when I withdraw it

[02-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to have a claimvout that matches the address you want to receive the tokens with

[02-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
on withdraw, you specify an arbitrary withdraw address so it has absolutely nothing to do with the deposit

[02-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
after all you could transfer all the tokens to someone else and they will want to withdraw to their address

just filled one of gaps in flow understanding

[02-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
at the code level all that is happening is that the CC is checking that the claimvout in the deposit goes to the same address as the claiming node's pubkey

[02-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, it is rejected

[02-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason should be clear. why is this restriction there?

[02-Oct-18 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
To be sure that right person will get the tokens?

[02-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise anybody can be watching for gatewaysdeposits and submit a claim to steal the tokens

[02-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it becomes a mempool race

[02-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not exactly a secure deposit process that we need

[02-Oct-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so is there a bug where the claiming pubkey cant be claimed by the proper node?

Seems we had same last time

[02-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so if to allow all addresses in the wallet, then all addresses need to be mapped to all possible CC outputs and then each time to sign a tx all vins compared against all addresses

[02-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is possible, but not implemented
