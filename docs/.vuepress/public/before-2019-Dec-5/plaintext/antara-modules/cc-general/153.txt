@TonyL what dir did you run it from?

[02-Feb-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that is where the files will be

[02-Feb-19 07:52 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c I run from rouge folder. Bat killed me on lvl1

[02-Feb-19 07:52 PM] TonyL#3577
So I guess it's a reason

[02-Feb-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, then you died before it would have made any files

[02-Feb-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
try to survive to level 2

@SHossain `I` opens inventory

[02-Feb-19 07:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Can change the weapon or use food

[02-Feb-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
what is this?

[02-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a scroll

[02-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a very good readme

[02-Feb-19 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks. found the html file

[02-Feb-19 08:15 PM] SHossain#0007
at level 2

[02-Feb-19 08:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Have we die on lvl2 or it should creates if just exit?

[02-Feb-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
died in level 2

[02-Feb-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
new file was created `rogue.123.2`

[02-Feb-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
started the game with `./rogue 123 gui`

[02-Feb-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
to replay do

[02-Feb-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
./rogue 123

[02-Feb-19 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Replay seems work

[02-Feb-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it was a trick to make it replay precisely and worried it wont always be identical state

[02-Feb-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Saw my inglorious death again :/

[02-Feb-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
when the ingame items can be extracted from a blockchain validated keystrokes file

[02-Feb-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
then it will become a lot more interesting

[02-Feb-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool, since tokensCC have DEX inside it will possible to trade ingame items

[02-Feb-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess

[02-Feb-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, exactly

[02-Feb-19 08:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Fantastic stuff

[02-Feb-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the control flow would be to creategame with buyin defined

[02-Feb-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
idea is someone will challenge someone or announce and then people will be able to see it via "pending"

[02-Feb-19 08:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be there some bots protection?

[02-Feb-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
then 5 minutes to register

[02-Feb-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i think for play money, bots wont be an issue

[02-Feb-19 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm or maybe no need bots protection - can make a clash of AI

[02-Feb-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually bots can and will arrive and the game will evolve into bot wars

[02-Feb-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
in early days it is easy mining

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
bots are like ASIC

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] TonyL#3577
PoR - proof of rogue

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] TonyL#3577
ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so you register and at first for newbie games, you just register. for buyin you need to have ROGUE coins

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh newbie games are faucet like

[02-Feb-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually the register will specify the external items you want to put back ingame

[02-Feb-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so people can farm by starting a newbie game, getting items and quit

[02-Feb-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that saves the inventory and any new items you got you can extract

[02-Feb-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so eventually the registering will be very interesting 5 minutes as people decide what items to bring ingame. those are lost if you die or get lost ingame

[02-Feb-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
once you are registered, it will submit progress of keystrokes, basically the keystrokes files in opreturn with state hashes. this way every node can verify you did find the 777 gold pieces

[02-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and in rogue you win by finding the amulet of yendor and go up back to level 1

[02-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so that is the winning condition to win all the buyins

[02-Feb-19 08:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems like another XX millions Ethereum smart-contact  ICO functionality

[02-Feb-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
running rogue on ETH would burn up a lot of gas

[02-Feb-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
imagine paying $4 in gas, just to be killed by a snake

[02-Feb-19 08:33 PM] TonyL#3577
I mean like you saw some project made ICO for onchain Sudoku ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Feb-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is 10x or more than sudoku

[02-Feb-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a proof of concept for any game that is deterministic random

[02-Feb-19 08:34 PM] SHossain#0007
reply works fine too

[02-Feb-19 08:34 PM] SHossain#0007
just quit at level 5

[02-Feb-19 08:34 PM] SHossain#0007
too much addictive

[02-Feb-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is quite dangerous

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007
will only play for testing if needed :abusedsmily:

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
with all the different scrolls, rings,staffs,weapons, monsters. it seems to have a lot more depth thanmany more recent games

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Super dangerous! I've spent a lot of nights on it - on mobile especially ðŸ˜‚

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, a lot of features

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
on rogue?

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a lot of interesting ports of rogue

[02-Feb-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Dungeon this, dungeon that

[02-Feb-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
any idea how many rogue players there are?

[02-Feb-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
i used  to play something similar (forgot the name) around 1993-4 time

[02-Feb-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
on a console

[02-Feb-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
with game cassetes

[02-Feb-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577

[02-Feb-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
1m+ downloads

[02-Feb-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
from the GUI, can you launch a console for the ./rogue?

[02-Feb-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
From the GUI of this mobile game?

[02-Feb-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
for ROGUE chain

[02-Feb-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking of the GUI, which will mostly be doing "lobby" function and eventually managing the inventory of ingame/external items

[02-Feb-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but for the gameplay, it needs to run in a console

[02-Feb-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah I see, launch terminal from GUI - why not I think

[02-Feb-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a Sudoku have a graphical interface for interaction with board and terminal outputs

[02-Feb-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
all the newgame, pending, register should be easy enough. I probably need to make it automatically do the pending tx

[02-Feb-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
then when you win, the gui can do the claimwin and extract rpc calls

[02-Feb-19 08:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Some attractive graphics is needed

[02-Feb-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there might be rogue text -> graphics GUI engines

[02-Feb-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, shiny graphics are the soul of modern games

[02-Feb-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
there should be something off the shelf that can visualize the rogue text screens

[02-Feb-19 08:42 PM] SHossain#0007
and, bit of animation and special effect

[02-Feb-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt be so hard to add a graphics layer on top as the game engine is generating all the events and drawing them onscreen

the hard part that nobody ever did was to blockchain enforce an rpg

[02-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to work with the original rogue

[02-Feb-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to do some joint project with a game company for the visualization

[02-Feb-19 08:45 PM] TonyL#3577
It working with similar elements - maybe possible to port on original one

[02-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to get sidetracked into making some graphical game

[02-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that will eat infinite time

[02-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
For purchases store design, lobby design collaboration is needed anyway

[02-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Items design, game design to make balance of items price and etc

[02-Feb-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe all we need is a TUI
