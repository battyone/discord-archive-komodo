the claim got a -25?

[02-Oct-18 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
gatewaysclaim get success and hex - getting -25 on broadcasting

[02-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
check all the vins to make sure they are still unspent

[02-Oct-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
gettxout is good for at

[02-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know if all vins are unspent

[02-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
also any console prints?

[02-Oct-18 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I had a lot of prints on `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewaysclaim`

isnt RMEdqjz6AyE5he7WXxD2Yf1mCVjUkxGQar the gateways CC address?

[02-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
let me look

[02-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL I have added rpc info and vin/vout allocation to channel CC docs. Tell me if it is clear, and do I need to clarify something. Pull request #903.

{Reactions}
ðŸ™Œ (2) ðŸ’¯ (2) 

[02-Oct-18 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Great! Will try channels asap

[02-Oct-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL did you change -pubkey on the node doing the gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim, it is expected they are both the same -pubkey=

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I mean it is possible for you to gatewaysdeposit to a different pubkey

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but whatever pubkey you deposited to, needs to be the -pubkey=

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess I might need to change it to explicitly use the claimpk

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
investigating

[02-Oct-18 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
I've changed `-pubkey=` only on node on which I'm trying to do `gatewaysclaim`

[02-Oct-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix

[02-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem was the gatewaysdeposit used the wrong pubkey, it used the default pubkey and in your deposit the claimpubkey was different

[02-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so do another gatewaydeposit

[02-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
using same cointxid. it should fail. if not that is a bug, as we cant be letting people do multiple deposits with the same cointxid!

[02-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
also, even in the mempool it should fail

[02-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a very important error that we need to verify we are getting

[02-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is verified, then you need to do another KMD deposit, but do it exactly the same and this time it should make a deposittxid that is spendable by the claimpubkey

[02-Oct-18 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Roger that. Will rebuild both nodes now and try to do same `gatewaydeposit` first

[02-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
what you ended up testing was a transfer of KMD to somebody else!

[02-Oct-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
via tokenization

[02-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the old code mistakenly assumed that you would only ever send to yourself

[02-Oct-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly a bug

[02-Oct-18 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577
great that we caught it so

[02-Oct-18 01:28 PM] TonyL#3577
`src/cc/dapps/oraclefeed.c | 4 ++--` @jl777c have I rebuild/restart `oraclesfeed` when will do a new `gatewaysdeposit`?

[02-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
shouldnt matter

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[02-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just the variable renaming

[02-Oct-18 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Got error for same `gatewaysdeposit` as was expected:
```pubkeys[0] 03431a95c761c491e38a891425009cff5f9eaa3aa3d3d4945dd17f3d0bfcff2590

[02-Oct-18 01:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Next `gatewaysdeposit` for a new transaction I'll rebroadcast fast to be sure that we getting an error when it's in mempool

[02-Oct-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
dont broadcast the identical one

[02-Oct-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it would just notice it is the same

[02-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so make a slightlydifferent gateways deposit rawtx

[02-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you can premake them to be able to test the mempool detection

[02-Oct-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just make sure they have different txid

[02-Oct-18 01:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, got it

[02-Oct-18 01:43 PM] TonyL#3577
For same hash generated I'll just rebroadcast same txid

[02-Oct-18 02:01 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c wow RPC validations are very strict now, not generating hex if I change any of parameters - is there any trick to generate not identical `gatewaysdeposit` transaction for same z_sendmany txid?

[02-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
is the signature the same too?

[02-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the identical parameters will generate a different rawhex

[02-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the signatures should have a randomized component

[02-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if it has any normal inputs

[02-Oct-18 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, generating different for same parameters if doing from different nodes

[02-Oct-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
good test is to broadcast simultaneous from different nodes

[02-Oct-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
which one gets mined should determine the "real" one

[02-Oct-18 02:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm one broadcasted, one hex not broadcasted ```error code: -25
error message:
Missing inputs``` even when tried it first

[02-Oct-18 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Generated with same parameters ðŸ¤•

[02-Oct-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so the error detection worked?

[02-Oct-18 02:08 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't think I've tested it since one hex not worked from start (when mempool was clear)

[02-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i guess we can test that later

[02-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
lets make sure the other -pubkey= node can claim

[02-Oct-18 02:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Have tokens on claiming node

[02-Oct-18 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
``` "totalsupply": "1.00000000",
  "remaining": "0.99000000",
  "issued": "0.01000000"```

[02-Oct-18 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Gateways supply reduced as expected

[02-Oct-18 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
But why there is such conversion rate? 0.01 KMD for 1000000 KMD tokens

[02-Oct-18 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
So when I'm creating token when I set supply I'm keeping in mind maximum cap of token in KMD

[02-Oct-18 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Supply `1` creating a token with `100000000` tokens supply with total value 1 KMD, more clear now

[02-Oct-18 02:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to be careful in trades later to not pay 1 KMD for  1/1000000 part of it ðŸ˜‚

[02-Oct-18 02:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to sell these tokens, convert back and withdraw after a short break

[02-Oct-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I changed the display of these tokens to use floating point

[02-Oct-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you look at them without the decimals it is the same as satoshis

[02-Oct-18 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I see. Work for GUI ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
tokens CC uses satoshis for tokens

[02-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, as long as it all is documented it should just be "work for GUI"

Yes in vout1

[02-Oct-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you did a convert to the redeem address

[02-Oct-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to convert to your own pubkey

[02-Oct-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
then the withdraw spends those 241 tokens for the withdraw

[02-Oct-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is, you made a donation of those tokens

[02-Oct-18 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
I see :/ My own pubkey = any pubkey on which I want to withdraw funds?

[02-Oct-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. whoever owns the tokens when the withdraw is done gets to say where they end up

[02-Oct-18 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
So pubkeys in `tokenconvert` and `gatewayswithdraw` needs to be same

[02-Oct-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
no!

[02-Oct-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to think in terms of the CC gateway

[02-Oct-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its job is to convert tokens for KMD

[02-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the person that does the withdraw must own the tokens

[02-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the destination pubkey on the KMD side can be any pubkey
