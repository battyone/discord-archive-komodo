Eth has rock and scissors betting  smartcontract. How easily could that be done in cc?

[23-Aug-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i see token trading happening as well

[23-Aug-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thats me

[23-Aug-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mark81 this is our dice contract https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/dice.cpp

only 1177 lines of code

[23-Aug-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
with this CC stuff, developers can code a lot of different types of contract

[23-Aug-18 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
the 4 contracts we have, didn't take long time for jl777 to code them.

[23-Aug-18 01:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are like 6 more in the works

[23-Aug-18 01:07 PM] SHossain#0007
yes.

[23-Aug-18 01:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
including payment channels, lotto, multigateway... etc.

[23-Aug-18 01:07 PM] SHossain#0007
FSM

[23-Aug-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also this is the first time smart contracts have been applied to a UTXO based blockchain.

[23-Aug-18 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
First on-chain dice game

[23-Aug-18 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for utxo, i believe so, yes.

[23-Aug-18 01:13 PM] Mark81#4505
Fsm?

[23-Aug-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
FSM is Finite State Machine

[23-Aug-18 01:14 PM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  If I try and run your script, how ccould I stop it?

[23-Aug-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont stop it.

[23-Aug-18 01:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need to change STAKED2 to the name of the chain your using and the FUNDTXID to the correct one

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then just run it... it uses odds of 1, and the size of bet is $1

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeahm I changed a few things.

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so if you saved it as dice

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`./dice 1` is bet 1 at 50/50 odds

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it will just go until it gets a result

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Just modified it, not yet saved.

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep, save it and `chmod +x <filename>`

[23-Aug-18 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you can run it

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have done over 2000 dice bets on STAKED2 with that script nearly.

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, so it only plays one game_

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it works fun until the TX get backed up in the mempool..

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they dont seem to mine out as fast as normal TX's

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have anohter script that will start heaps of them, but that cna get dangerous unles you know what your doing.

[23-Aug-18 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
play with 1 first lol

[23-Aug-18 01:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!

[23-Aug-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries, hope it works for you.

[23-Aug-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the fiunding txid is right and the AC name is right it *shuld* work

[23-Aug-18 01:17 PM] CrisF#3405
I*ll try it now.

[23-Aug-18 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405

i have just added few more millions for you

[23-Aug-18 01:54 PM] CrisF#3405
That must be from mining with your future computer!

[23-Aug-18 01:56 PM] SHossain#0007
actually, just a 4 core VPS setup is the seednode and mining. in the beginning i used future computer to mine some blocks to get some blocks for testing

[23-Aug-18 01:56 PM] SHossain#0007
about 15 million in the local node üòõ

if anyone puts odds over the max limit, stdout will warn you

it would be nice to get an error msg in console for these, but I noticed this yesterday testing, that hte error is there, just "hidden" lol

[23-Aug-18 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the onyl one I found that had no error was when there was no entropy TX left, it created a malformed TX, but james fixed that already

[23-Aug-18 03:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt able to test  yet though... maybe you can

[23-Aug-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
those are from stdout
the command replies
```
        "result": "error",
        "error": "couldnt create dice bet transaction. make sure your address has funds"

Added some more token CC auto tests: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/commit/f3b2377d34bb03bae58a558c5beff4bb3b9e37dc
Going to cover more dice features and will make pull request then.

This should discourage someone to create spam dice plans.

[23-Aug-18 04:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is it a forking change?

[23-Aug-18 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
I think similar rule should be for tokens creation

[23-Aug-18 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Possible to spam as well

[23-Aug-18 04:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and rewards plans

[23-Aug-18 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I think might be very useful to add  some `owner=pubkey` parameter to `info` call of each CC or ability to list CCs owned by user.
Maybe I'm missing something, but now I'm able to find which CCs I've created only by calls history. (dices, orders, tokens and etc.).
Like a CC which manages and standardise CC protocol.

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers rewards plans require 1 coin minimum

[23-Aug-18 05:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[23-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL What can you spam with assets?

[23-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
You can sort the orderbook by token, so I don't think it's a problem

[23-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Alright#0419
and creating single sat tokens could be used for some pretty cool things

[23-Aug-18 05:53 PM] TonyL#3577
@Alright I can create tons of new tokens for example

[23-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
Right, forgot their was `tokenlist`

[23-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
although I feel `dicelist` and `rewardslist` is more important than `tokenlist` in that you wouldn't just be browsing through `tokenlist`

[23-Aug-18 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I have to find my token in millions of. It's possible to create tokens with same name so only txid will be different.

[23-Aug-18 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I spammed some to BRK for demonstration :trollface: üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
Had a conversation about this last night actually. Just thinking of the future. Can you imagine a single satoshi that is the "deed" to your house?

[23-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
want to put your house on the market? `tokenask` üòõ

[23-Aug-18 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
only problem is there needs to be some authority to enforce that whoever owns that satoshi owns the house

[23-Aug-18 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Tokenisation is future thing yeah. And there is a lot of projects at the moment who doing tokenisation of real stocks for example. I'm even helped with WP to one of such

[23-Aug-18 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers it is not hardforking change.
