This is what we have in our notes:
```
-ac_cc=1
--------

Setting ``-ac_cc=1`` permits smart contracts on the asset chain, but will not allow the asset chain to interact in cross-chain smart contracts with other asset chains.

-ac_cc=2 to 100
---------------

The values of ``2`` through ``100`` indicate asset chains that can import functions across asset chains, but their coins are not fungible.

For example, an asset chain may be able to query another asset chain on the same ``ac_cc`` cluster for details about a transaction.

However, coins may not be transferred between blockchains.
```

[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok.

[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Well, hmm...

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
when you start it prints what pubkey it is using

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
does it show a pubkey or ()

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's the command I'm using to launch:
```
./komodod -pubkey=033a7af03e6c2a8199e95a90b46530ea677d2d526258b83ab5561f562cbf4bd08c -ac_name=AAB -ac_supply=10000 $1 &

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -pubkey=033a7af03e6c2a8199e95a90b46530ea677d2d526258b83ab5561f562cbf4bd08c -ac_name=AAB -ac_supply=10000 $1 &

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the $1 but that assumes you pass it in each time

[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, yes, I forgot that this time

[06-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
precision is needed

[06-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
why make a variable for something that is constant?

[06-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that only leads to the chance to forget

[06-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

```

Still getting `to use CC contracts you need a valid pubkey`...

[06-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
correction, this is the launch command:
```
./komodod -pubkey=033a7af03e6c2a8199e95a90b46530ea677d2d526258b83ab5561f562cbf4bd08c -ac_name=AAB -ac_supply=10000 -ac_cc=1 $1 &
```

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't have any variables. I know very little about shell scripting.

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The $1 is just something that I put in there, because I see it in all the launch params for the other asset chains we have.

[06-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can leave it out.

your pubkey is noticed

[06-Oct-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be working now

[06-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Should I be using `scriptPubKey`?

[06-Oct-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
no, all seems right

[06-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm... what could I be doing wrong then...

[06-Oct-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810

[06-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, it's in my wallet

[06-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
can you start from scratch and NEVER forget the -ac_cc=1

[06-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sure, just make a new chain entirely?

[06-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I can do that.

[06-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It'll take a few minutes.

[06-Oct-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be running it with and wihout and with got into a bad state

[06-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
interesting, gtk

[06-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
launch command on machine 1:
```

```

[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Mylo#8306
Ah interesting about the start without and with ac_cc on an already existing chain.  I think I‚Äôve hit this snag before if that is the case

[06-Oct-18 12:13 PM] Mylo#8306
Off-topic, but I‚Äôm using a Makefile and the `make` command to reduce errors when doing work with docker and vps deployment.      Same could be done with chains.  In all this test environment across multiple chains and testers

[06-Oct-18 12:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[06-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, so launching w/o the `ac_cc` param will mess up something permanently...

I'll make a note of that.

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Mylo#8306
üôè thanks @Bryan_Beus appreesh that discovery üòÉ

:abusedsmily:

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes technically they are different chains

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but sharing the same name, dir, etc

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
big mess

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's weird that the issue is permanent, though

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
wont work

[06-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
makes sense

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
every try sharing the same directory with two different things, using the same names

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
cant even imaging all the things that could go wrong

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing it didnt just crash

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, okay

[06-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
gtk

[06-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm going to separate out the documentation so that there's two tracks - one for people who just want to use the existing commands, and one for people who want to write an actual cc...

For people who want to write an actual cc, I think we'll just leave them what you've already written, jl777

For all the pleb devs, I almost wonder if all this can be combined with the rpc calls in the basic API docs.

I'll wait 'till I finish them all to decide, but if it's just an rpc call, i don't see why not.

[06-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, I'm doing something else wrong here:
```

[06-Oct-18 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus if you are the only one mining for test, you can use `-genproclimit=1` instead of `-genproclimit=$(nproc)` to use less CPU core and it will still work fine.

[06-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, ya....

[06-Oct-18 12:26 PM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, most of your CPU threads will be mining

[06-Oct-18 12:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
good point

[06-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think there's a command for turning down the nproc without relaunching...

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you didnt seem to do a sendrawtransaction of the hex like you need to

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont broadcast the rawtx, the rawtx is not broadcast

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if the tx is not broadcast, no node processes it

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
if no node processes it, it is the same as if it didnt happen

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810

[06-Oct-18 12:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thx

[06-Oct-18 12:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, let's see...

[06-Oct-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also until it confirms, it isnt really active

[06-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some rate exceptions to this, but for the most part CC tx needs to confirm to take effect

[06-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
rare

[06-Oct-18 12:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
not seeing where/how to sendrawtransaction...

[06-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't seem to have `sendrawtransaction` in the basic API/rpc commands doc...

[06-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but I see it in `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAC help sendrawtransaction`

[06-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, nm

[06-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was looking in the ac params

[06-Oct-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a "norma" signed transaction as far as the daemon is concerned

[06-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
do I need to sign it first? Is that what you're referring to about the "normal" signed tx?

[06-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
just sendrawtransaction with the hex from `faucetfund` didn't seem to produce a result in `faucetinfo`

[06-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
did you get a txid

[06-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
did the txid confirm

[06-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
when I say it needs to be confirmed to have any effect, i mean that until it is confirmed it wont have any effect

[06-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
waiting on this command:

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAC faucetget
```

If I understand correctly, this is supposed to take a minute or two to execute.

[06-Oct-18 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
for `faucetget` you need to start the daemon with a new pubkey and no balance in it. ideally, you may need a 3rd node, since you are using 2 to mine and keep the network up.

[06-Oct-18 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
why don't you just use the CCNG chain? params are pinned and there are nodes mining it. giving you flexibility only to test

[06-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh... so the command I executed isn't going to work...
