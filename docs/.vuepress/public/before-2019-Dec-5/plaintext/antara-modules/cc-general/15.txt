your price is 1 ATEST per asset, for 1000 assets?

[25-Jul-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:p

[25-Jul-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
taking into account that the block reward is 100k ATEST perblock

[25-Jul-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"blocks": 2673,
  "longestchain": 2687,

[25-Jul-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have this issue though

[25-Jul-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
didnt realize it was such a high blockreward! it is a good test

[25-Jul-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so the display for 's' seems fine

[25-Jul-18 08:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[25-Jul-18 09:11 PM] cipi#4502
are you running a miner for CHIPS?

antminer t9+

[25-Jul-18 09:13 PM] cipi#4502
nice... and thanks a lot, CHIPS blocks were coming very slowly in the last days

[25-Jul-18 09:16 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll keep them running for a while, operating from my friends garden shed. yesterday, the miners were running at 93C due to the hot weather here.

[25-Jul-18 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
this address `RSVwXstQM8gGV4fNJ5MWHuBpbqNv4E6HH5` is also mining CHIPS.

[25-Jul-18 09:18 PM] cipi#4502
lol, yes, it is very hot here too... that's why i sleep during day and do cryptostuff during night..

[25-Jul-18 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
good idea

[25-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
sort of think there may be something else wrong with the CHIPS network other than just lack of hash rate and someone profit switching with a shit load of hash rate

[25-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
it stalled for several hours even while SHo's 21TH was mining it constantly

[25-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
and the block times are rarely consistent

[25-Jul-18 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
problems with fillsell, to complex to solve when tired.

[25-Jul-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but buy side likely still has some issues, especially if you dont have big enough utxos and other edge cases

[25-Jul-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so all but the fillsell and swap rpc calls are ready for testing
