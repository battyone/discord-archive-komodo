each having a set of payments defined

[17-Sep-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so I am working my way up to FSM, which will use most of the other CC

[17-Sep-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
no need for a programming language using the FSM CC

[17-Sep-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
just create the various required txid via rpc

[17-Sep-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
all the various pieces dont quite fit together yet... but as each one is completed there are less and less undefined things so at some point I can just ask @Mihailo to just debug it all üòÉ

[17-Sep-18 05:25 PM] jusoaresf#3291
These new 4 still work "standalone" too?

[17-Sep-18 05:28 PM] jusoaresf#3291
language free FSM üéÉ

[17-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
they will work standalone, but maybe it wont have much direct usecases. not sure what you can do with a trigger that doesnt have any actions. though I guess I can build in some basic actions

[17-Sep-18 05:36 PM] jusoaresf#3291
I see. Perhaps. But they will be very important for future dapps like cherry picking CCs...

[17-Sep-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like the oracles CC, in and of itself, it doesnt really give you much more than looking up a URL directly

[17-Sep-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but the fact it is onchain and there is consensus, it can be an input to blockchain operations

[17-Sep-18 05:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c on which stage it's planning to make RPC more strict for a new CCs? (asking in spot of auto-tests coverage)

[17-Sep-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
once a CC is deemed to be feature complete, then go ahead and go caveman on all its parameters. we can track reproducible bugs via github issues and fix them

I had trouble yesterday with GUI faucet.   Btcpubkey at komodod start and import kmdprivkey came back with errors.
`ExtractDestination failed`
Was notary keys in `-regtest` mode.
Then when using unused/new keys, also in regtest `to use CC contracts you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey for an address in your wallet. ERR=-1`
Will move onto other first 4 GUIs today and revisit faucet after ‚Äúother‚Äù successes

[18-Sep-18 04:01 AM] Mylo#8306
@SHossain probably best to ask you later today.   As long as it doesn‚Äôt have to be NN keys.  I used to be able to use it only with NN.
Also tested AC in `-regtest` with same result.

[18-Sep-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC have no concept of notaries

[18-Sep-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
though for some special cases we will likely use the concept of notarized height

[18-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks for clarification James

[18-Sep-18 01:54 PM] Mylo#8306
@jl777c @Mihailo 
Is this a very basic way of explaining ChannelsCC?

The very basic explanation in four steps is:
 - Set up a payment channel with your denominations (10k satoshi in this case)
 - Provide a secret to spend each of those denominations
 - Have the channel notarized for bitcoin level security
 - Send out authorizations for those payment channels to be spent, one at a time.

If you need to send 50k satoshi, authorize the release of 5 of those 10k payments by sending the the payment details to the person‚Äôs destination address.

[18-Sep-18 01:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Mylo That is it basically, with two modifications:
- the secrete does need to be defined, it is done by RPC. You basically open the channel with one tx (and that lock funds in the channel), and then with payment tx you release payments in number of denominations you want. Everything is done by RPC (even if it is used by wild generated TX the secrete generation must be followed as it is done in RPC calls for tx to be valid)
- second modification to your explanation is just that it is not necessary to have notarized chain for channels CC, but it is always more secure that way.

[18-Sep-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
2 of the 4 steps above are not anything the user needs to do.

[18-Sep-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you fund a payment channel to a destination

[18-Sep-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
then you release payments

[18-Sep-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
that's it as far as user is concerned

[18-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
the 2nd and 3rd üòâ

[18-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Mylo#8306
OK - cool.  The user doesn't need to know the details yep understood.
So the release of funds is just a normal transaction, compatible with all existing infrastructure.

ChannelPayment in channels.cpp doesn't have the RPC help command stuff, where's some RPC command info kept?   Been looking in jl777 FSM branch.

Explanation is for tech article, will note that notarization is not needed but nice to have for bitcoin level security.

Congrats btw @Mihailo üëç

[18-Sep-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
Mihailo hasnt made a pull request into FSM yet

[18-Sep-18 02:32 PM] Mylo#8306
oh ok thanks

[19-Sep-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
multisig support via partial signatures is coded, but not verified yet. I want to verify some things about the prices (bitmex) CC first

[19-Sep-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
coded half the prices CC, but stuck on normalizing bet amount to leveraged price. more progress tomorrow

need to change things around a bit with gateways CC to be able to properly validate it. this was a bit unexpected, but then again combining multiple CC together is the first time with gateways CC, so not exactly surprising there are some issues doing that

Doing oracles mass data publishing tests. 200 oracles with 2 data entries to each in one block - passed.
For ~more than 500 data publishings in same block `oraclesdata` generating hex which broadcasting returns ```error code: -26
error message:
18: bad-txns-inputs-spent```

[20-Sep-18 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Such hex have one of `vins` spent

[20-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
is it just one thread that is doing all this?

[20-Sep-18 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup, but it's doing one by one, not simultaneously

[20-Sep-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there is some limit to chaining mempool tx

[20-Sep-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what about 300? 400?

[20-Sep-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
257?

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought so but I'm starting with clear mempool and getting such hex on random place each time

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Sending same data

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
random between 200 and 500?

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
One time I can get it on 350 transactions, second time on 450

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think in this range

[20-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Approximately

[20-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets find a reasonably safe limit and document that that is the practical limit

[20-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
200 in one block is 3+ per second. seems plenty fast

[20-Sep-18 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll make more tests and some spreadsheet

[20-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
any usage of oracles for faster than 1 minute data, will have some issues

[20-Sep-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the question is how many issues and if we can sidestep them

[20-Sep-18 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw surprised how fast is `oraclessamples` works. Possible to get and write to separate files 500+ data entries from blockchain for less than in 0.1 sec in one thread.

[20-Sep-18 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c As I see problem is that this hex is not valid even mempool is clear next block. So dAPP devs have to keep in mind that transaction re-creating needed, not just re-broadcast attempt

[20-Sep-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes if inputs are already spent, then need to make a new one

[20-Sep-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
what is happening is that the prior tx isnt getting into the mempool yet and you ask for another datasample

[20-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
what you could do is call a lockunspent call for all vins in the tx that comes back

[20-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that should work around this problem

[20-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
at the CC level, I dont know what the plan for broadcasting the tx is, so this belongs at the dapp layer

[20-Sep-18 08:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm using now very simple data (just `ff`).  Is it significant difference in spot of blocksize fit if I'll broadcast let's say `ffff` or `ffffff` ?

[20-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
overhead for tx is about 300 bytes

[20-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
3 byte difference is 1%

[20-Sep-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know how to iterate through the vins and locking the utxo?

[20-Sep-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
decode the tx, for each txid/vout in the vin[] array, call the lockunspent that makes it so the listunspent wont return it

[20-Sep-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
which will prevent the oraclesdata from issuing it

[20-Sep-18 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean using it

[20-Sep-18 08:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to try it. So I have just get vins array before the `oraclesdata` transaction broadcast and call `lockunspent` for each vin and then broadcast?

[20-Sep-18 08:10 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c is it ok if I'll execute for all `oraclesdata` transactions, not just failed?

[20-Sep-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, when the rawtx comes back, lock all its vins, then broadcast it

[20-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if you do that, then even without broadcasting it will make valid tx

[20-Sep-18 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @jl777c ! Will try this trick

[20-Sep-18 09:16 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c still can't broadcast tx after locking all vins. Am I doing something not correct?

[20-Sep-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
why are all the vout 0 in the locks, but in the tx it is non-zero values a lot

[20-Sep-18 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried 0,1,2 vouts as well but same result

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
also, if the tx is wrong, it is wrong with or without locks. the vins in the bad tx is reusing vin from prior

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt be using random vouts!

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
use the one specifically from the rawtx

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
get things to a stable situation

[20-Sep-18 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577

Hi.
I've been reading about the Komodo CryptoConditions. Congratulations! It looks to me like a very powerful technology. My question, which I've not found answered in any of the current texts, is: How a zk-snark transactions can be used with UTXO based smart contracts? Is there any way with the current implementation?

Of course I'm thinking on privacy powered Voting system. For such thing we need mainly:
+ A way to sign claims (like address X is able to vote). This might be achieved by just adding a signed claim to a blockchain  block
+ A way to create a temporary assetchain. This seems that can be avhieved using CryptoConditions
+ A way to use this temporary assetchain tokens from a Zk-snark transactions which will have the voting option encapsuled in MeMo field

[20-Sep-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with using ztransactions as inputs to CC is that they are private

[20-Sep-18 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i think some sort of homomorphic tech is needed to be put in opreturns to have a chance to use z-inputs

[20-Sep-18 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can just use tokens from assets CC for voting, no need for a dedicated chain

[20-Sep-18 09:44 AM] d3n#0940
"maybe you can just use tokens from assets CC for voting, no need for a dedicated chain"
Sure! When I said "AssetChain" I meant a CC asset token

[20-Sep-18 09:45 AM] d3n#0940
So I'm thinking about doing all required stuff that right now we are doing in Ethereum + komodo-temporary-asset-chains in Komodo MainNet

[20-Sep-18 09:46 AM] d3n#0940
But... we still need CC+Zk-snarks

[20-Sep-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use the ztx using the assetchain as a voting mechanism. we did that with VOTE2018 for notary election

[20-Sep-18 10:01 AM] d3n#0940
Yes, this is what we've already done: https://github.com/vocdoni/documentation
But after reading about CC I'm thinking about using only the Komodo MainNet, for signing claims to users and to vote

[20-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL gatewaysCC requires tokens that are converted to gateways CC out, there is a new token rpc tokenconvert rpc that can do this

[20-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
also before redeeming, it also needs to be converted

[20-Sep-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason for this is vin enforcement. if it isnt changed to gateways vout, then only assets enforcement is done and it would just allow a simple transfer from the "locked" funds as the locking is done by the gateways CC

[20-Sep-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the gateways CC automatically converts to assets vout on a gatewaysclaim

[20-Sep-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
this trick of converting tokens to a different CC appears to be the way to allow adding additional rules to another CC (assets). I will make sure the same method will work for prices CC. I think it will as the idea is there are freely tradeable tokens, which when converted become subject to the new rules. Great care is needed for all conversions to and from normal tokens as any bug will affect basic token function

[21-Sep-18 06:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Is converted token can be used same way as non converted outside of gateways CC (e.g. trades, transfers)? And also is anybody can convert any token or it should do owner of token creation privkey?

[21-Sep-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to be able to spend the token, so it needs to be in an address you have privkey for
