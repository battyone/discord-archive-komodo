leveraging the existing bitcoin protocol

[09-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
heh

yes, I can appreciate the simplicity

[09-Nov-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, it isnt a full DB

[09-Nov-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but it lets you very efficiently fine the most recent samples from any publisher

[09-Nov-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
which is really what most dapps need

[09-Nov-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
all in a data marketplace context

[09-Nov-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so the cost for the oraclizing of data is paid for by the datafee

[09-Nov-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
really, an entire major crypto project can be made out of oracles CC

[09-Nov-18 01:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, I can see that

[09-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
seems like oracles can basically be a repository for placing existing legacy solutions that are non-decentralized into a blockchain format, while waiting to see what more can be solved with other blockchain/smart-contract technologies

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what is the difference between `baton` and `batontxid`?

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I see `baton` is an address

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and `batontxid` is a typical txid has

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hash

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I guess I should ask, what is the baton address used for?

[09-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
do all batontxids take place in the baton address?

[09-Nov-18 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the batontxid is the baton utxo sent to the baton address

[09-Nov-18 01:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
this is changing my understanding

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think part of the difficulty in understanding this is that I'm still confused about how cc addresses work...

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
when a publisher does `oraclesregister`, do they get both a `baton` and `batontxid`?

[09-Nov-18 01:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm looking through the method, but it's a long complicated hex

[09-Nov-18 01:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and I don't see any mention of baton in `oraclesregister`

[09-Nov-18 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
baton address is just the address of the publisher

[09-Nov-18 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
normal address

[09-Nov-18 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
Getscriptaddress(batonaddr,regtx.vout[1].scriptPubKey);

[09-Nov-18 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, sorry it is a CC address

[09-Nov-18 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
which is a CC script derived from the publishers pubkey, so it has the publishers pubkey and the oracles eval code

[09-Nov-18 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that is put into crypto-conditions serialization

[09-Nov-18 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then it is hashed and that is the OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITIONS script

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
I then use the normal method of calculating bitcoin addresses by hashing the CC vout scriptPubkey, adding KMD prefix and base58 encoding it

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if anything about the CC vout is changed, the address changes

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so a different pubkey changes the CC address

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
a different evalcode, changes the CC address

[09-Nov-18 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
a different cryptocondition (1of2, 2of2, etc) will change the CC address

[09-Nov-18 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the CC address is just the base58 encoding of the serialized cryptocondition hash

[09-Nov-18 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so each pubkey gets one CC address per different CC

[09-Nov-18 02:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
interesting. I think i follow that. Will save it.

going to write instructions and more details about cc addresses soon

[09-Nov-18 03:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
curious, in `oraclesregister`, why do we have the user indicate the desired publisher by using `batonutxo`, and not `baton`? 

as the `baton` address doesn't change, but the `batonutxo` does,  why do we use `batonutxo`?

[09-Nov-18 05:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

another question, I don't see a method for adding more funds to a subscription. is the `datafee` on `oraclessubscribe`, is that acting like an advance depost, so you have to put in more than the minimum fee?

[09-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
also, do you have to subscribe to have any kind of special access to the oracle? or is it that once an oracle uploads data, it's open sourced?

[09-Nov-18 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You just subscribe more than once, I think... .or at least thats how the Chat dAPP is using it.

[09-Nov-18 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
subscribe more to prepay more

[09-Nov-18 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
all data is on the blockchain

[09-Nov-18 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
however it is possible to provide encrypted data to limit who gets the data

[09-Nov-18 08:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, for example, a publisher would write a script or something that would send a key to the addresses from which the subscription fees come?

[09-Nov-18 08:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, this question from earlier:

curious, in oraclesregister, why do we have the user indicate the desired publisher by using batonutxo, and not baton? 

as the baton address doesn't change, but the batonutxo does,  why do we use batonutxo?

[09-Nov-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are confused about batons

[09-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
oraclesregister is done only by the publisher

[09-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
he creates the first baton

[09-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
blockchains dont have addresses in them, just pubkeys or hashes

[09-Nov-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
by specifying a specific baton utxo, you specify the baton address and further, the specific tx in the linked list

[09-Nov-18 08:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I think I get that. thanks

[09-Nov-18 10:12 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

@Falkvinge The idea could be good only if conditioned by user using smart contract - so that when I die (my condition would be no tx for 1 year) my funds would go to family, friends or organization I support. Not sure if BSV can achieve that. I believe ETH, EOS, Lisk or KM...

[09-Nov-18 10:13 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
time-based user conditioned tx from specific address

[09-Nov-18 10:13 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
best would be if the "code" would run even if wallet off - not dependent on specific machine?

[09-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if you lock your funds in to a special contract, then it can be claimed by heirs if you dont use the funds for a year

[09-Nov-18 10:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is one of the problems that if solved, could be a big deal.

[09-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems rather a trivial thing to do...

[09-Nov-18 10:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats a good way to do it. If you don't move the funds within a year, the keys you gave to your beneficiary would have access to the funds

[09-Nov-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
basically you want a DMS

[09-Nov-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is the big stash of funds locked in the inheritance address, a set of smaller amount addresses are referenced, if all of them are idle for the specified amount of time, the heir can spend the big stash

[09-Nov-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the owner is free to withdraw funds from the big stash at any time

[09-Nov-18 10:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
so how reliable would the date keeping be? would it be referenced to a particular block height?

[09-Nov-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be X amount of time/blocks from the last time any of the referenced addresses sent any funds

[09-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
simpler to make it blocks (minutes)

[09-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
simplest case is to refer to the big stash address itself. then if you stop using it, it can be claimed

[09-Nov-18 10:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
is cc modular enough to do this with other coins or would it be exclusive to kmd?

[09-Nov-18 10:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess all you need is to display a message with the key

[09-Nov-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
any CC activated chain can be used

[09-Nov-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if tokens are supported, then tokenized versions of other coins can also be done,but that makes it more complicated to do

[09-Nov-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
It would be pretty trick to hack some thing like a ledger hardware wallet to do it for you.

[09-Nov-18 10:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
your heirs plug it in, open the app, "funds not accessible"... wait a year. "I'm dead, here's your inheritance"

[09-Nov-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ledger wouldnt support it

[09-Nov-18 11:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
ledger the company? or the hardware itself is not capable of referencing the contract?

[09-Nov-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
ledger only does normal taddr tx, not CC

[09-Nov-18 11:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
so is it just a matter of writing the firmware to make cc work with an appropriate chipset?

[09-Nov-18 11:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
idk, I'm way out of my depth here. just spitballing

[09-Nov-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
considering how much work it was to get rewards claiming working, getting CC support is like 1000x the effort

[09-Nov-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe by the year 2500

[09-Nov-18 11:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah I've been following that. lukechilds made the magic happen.

[09-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hey @Mihailo 

Whenever you are ready.

[09-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hey, go ahead

[09-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Bryan_Beus Wanna continue in DM?

[09-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sure

[09-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
well...

[09-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let's talk about general stuff here, then any specific technical stuff in dm

[09-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[09-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We're going over... channels, right?

[09-Nov-18 04:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep

[09-Nov-18 04:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
How would you introduce the channels smart contract?

[09-Nov-18 04:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What's it generally about, and how does it work?

[09-Nov-18 04:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll take your description and turn this into a paragraph or three, depending on how complex.

[09-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
Channels CC is a mechanism to make instant payments between two points without a need to wait for transactions to get in the chain and be confirmed. This possible because the funds are locked in a special CC address that could be spent only by owners of private keys for those two pubkeys that are used in creating channel and then funds are released with each payment by the sender to receiver. After that tx with locking funds is protected with dPoW (notarized)  the receiving party can be sure it will receive funds at the moment the payment tx gets in the mempool.

[09-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So channels creates instant payments -- verified as soon as they are in the mempool.

[09-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
that's a useful feature!

[09-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Correct

[09-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Very

[09-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can we combine this with other cc's?

[09-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, there is idea to combine it with other CCs to be able to instant pay tokens or tokenized deposit from gateway and etc.

[09-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is not so simple to combine multiple CCs
