Yes we were asked to test channels, but notarisation check is a stub so we stopped.

[11-Oct-18 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best you guys get everything else bug free first before we try to reorg payments

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In the marketing meeting today, we were trying to create a narrative to visualize what our customers will be doing with CC.

There were a few areas where we ran to the edge of my understanding.

Can one of the devs please help correct this visualization wherever it is inaccurate?

Let's say that I'm a dApp dev and I want to make a card game.

I have my main asset chain. It serves as the underlying currency for performing transactions on the chain. It is not designed to be a high-market cap coin, by itself.

First, a user will install my software, create a pubkey, do a `faucetget` cc command to get just a small amount of my base currency.

With that, they will then perform a transaction on the network that broadcasts their chosen pubkey (and base58 address), and also the CC-address pairing for that pubkey. This is `AddressA-on-MY-asset-chain`.

For the player to really get started, they first need to pay me, so they can enter my ecosystem, and for that we uses MoMoM and a CC-based STABLE coin. For players to pay me, and to enter my gaming community, I require that they send me $10 USD worth of a KMD-based STABLE coin. They'll send this from a transparent address, `AddressA-on-STABLE`, on the STABLE coin blockchain.

Using MoMoM, my blockchain can detect that my address on the STABLE coin received the correct amount. One of my nodes will then automatically send to `AddressA-on-MY-asset-chain`a starter kit.

[11-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The starter kit will include X amount of the asset chain currency.

It will also an assortment of tokens. The tokens are like cards in a character, RPG-based card game.

Each token has a set of descriptions and properties, like STRENGTH, STAMINA, BASE-HEALTH, et.c,  that affect the token's ability to play against other players.

Now, my user wants to start playing against other players online. 

He and another player connect to one of my nodes, and they also connect to each other. My node is acting as an Oracle. 

The two players place certain items into a CC-based smart contract (yet to be written?), where the person who wins will receive these items. 

Now, they play the card game, broadcasting the data of their decisions to each other. My node simply observes and records the information into my asset chain, making sure all proceeds smoothly.

The game lasts for one hour. During that time, several notarizations of my data make it into KMD, and then into Bitcoin.

[11-Oct-18 12:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
At the conclusion of the game, all three of the nodes (mine, and both of the playing users), calculate the results and payout the CC smart contract according to the winner.

The player who won now has a collection of new tokens that they can use to play again, while the other player has to start over (and perhaps the payout of items is varied across the game, so it's not just winner-take-all, but rather winner-take-more, and loser-take-less).

[11-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Out of the technologies above, dPoW is working fairly reliably, MoMoM is online but not thoroughly tested yet, STABLE is still in testing, Oracle is also in testing, Tokens are not in testing, and there is a CC smart contract required to manage the payout according to the results. 

Those are the aspects that KMD and the open-source KMD-ecosystem community want to provide to our users.

In addition, the dApp developer will want to write their own unique software to make a beautiful dApp game. 

How are we doing in understanding?

[11-Oct-18 12:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats a very large scope... and kind of similar to something me and a mate discussed a while back.

[11-Oct-18 12:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM is not activated across all AC at this stage. We are tesing it on STAKED  and currently only have corss chain fungible clusters with working code to test with.

[11-Oct-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We would need another CC that works with MoM chains under cc=100 for validating TX from one AC to another ... currently MoMoM needs KMD full node for 1 step of the process.

[11-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for MoMoM to work correctly it needs a few fixes and to be actually enabled in iguana across all chains... We need to test how far it scales, ie number of chains.

[11-Oct-18 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am pretty sure the chance of a mismatch increases with more and more chains added to the cluster.

[11-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also things like ondemand chains, and PoS chains with blocktimes that can vary a lot, might introduce other points of failure, and we need to test that thourghly aswell still.

[11-Oct-18 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope someone else cna help you wiht the other questions

[11-Oct-18 12:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's helpful. Thank you. Yes, I know that MoMoM is still in the early stages. I'm just hoping that I have the general idea now.

[11-Oct-18 12:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you are just trying to describe whats possible .. .they what you say seems liek ti would work, but it would be VERY hard to implement

@blackjok3r 

Can you give me a different narrative, but of what you think is realistic, within the next six to twelve months?

[11-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just an example use case that is within a dApp dev's ability to achieve?

[11-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really, I havent used enough of them. my experaiance is limited.

[11-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I only answered to what i know about

[11-Oct-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont want to speculate on things

[11-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok

[11-Oct-18 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang nice cc docs 😃

[11-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus put that use case into a gist for later.
Eg https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/d363de0a40fc6f56c0ef8d9f681e2f73
This is basic AC creation, rewardsCC, oracleCC for gps or other activity data, scaling configuration

@TonyL CCNG is not being notarized, why? We can do it if you need to test something

[11-Oct-18 10:08 PM] CrisF#3405
@gcharang Great job again by you and everyone involved. The cc rpc docs are brilliant!! :Komodo:

[12-Oct-18 06:27 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF @dukeleto Thanks guys. Do make any suggestions that would improve them.

[12-Oct-18 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
is oraclesdata limited to once per block per publisher?

[12-Oct-18 06:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Nope, it's not limited. If you need to publish more than one oraclesdata per block you need to create UTXOs by oraclessubscribe

[12-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, I understand

[12-Oct-18 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
thanks

[12-Oct-18 06:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Regards notarizations - in future Channels will work with it, thats why I've asked )

[12-Oct-18 06:31 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/gateways_cc_cli.py in this tool you can find oracles UTXOs generator if needed 😃

when a tx in is the chaintip, that is 1 confirmation

[12-Oct-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the check in the CC seems of by 1

[12-Oct-18 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Thinking now where to move next: can create TUI for assetsCC trading, or for betsCC placing, or improve gatewaysCC TUI automation (but it's better to do on feedback of someone tested it), or can start cover some uncovered CCs by auto-tests. Maybe if start write tests more probably to find bugs 🤔

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the most important untested one is multisig gateways CC deposit address

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is in a totally untested path, so maybe nothing works at all

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
together with @Mihailo I hope you two can find and fix all the bugs in oracles and gateways CC

[12-Oct-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
no better way to learn something than by breaking and fixing it

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Multisig gateways option is more than one pubkey usage on this stage ` gatewaysbind tokenid oracletxid coin tokensupply M N pubkey(s)` ?

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, try 2 3 <pubkey0> <pubkey1> <pubkey2)

[12-Oct-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
that will make a 2of3 multisig deposit address, starting with b for KMD

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
then at least 2 of three of those pubkeyX nodes needs to run oraclefeed properly to process withdraw requests

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i am 99.99% sure that there will be some problems with the msig withdraw, have fun to find and fix them!

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems interesting! Going ahead with it

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
and one this is working, the gateways CC will offer the absolute best level of decentralization for a token DEX

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
I envision something like 7 of 13 trusted community members to be running the deposit pubkeys

[12-Oct-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and with it be automated if oraclefeed is running, the withdraw guarantee is that 7 of 13 are simply running the oraclefeed

Is it possible to lock a block reward with a CC?  Further, can the BR then be paid out / distributed by another CC according to a different rule, like shares of participation of some external activity?

[12-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Mylo#8306
External activity having been oracle ized

[12-Oct-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was wondering this too ... for TROLL I wanted the BR to go into the faucet fund

[12-Oct-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
instead i used the maximum AC supply, and put it all in the faucet...

[12-Oct-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
burns all TX fees

[12-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL @blackjok3r has a simple TUI for dice betting already

[12-Oct-18 09:29 AM] CrisF#3405
@gcharang The only suggestion that I would have at the moment is to keep doing what you are doing.  I figure any other suggestions I might have are very minor in comparison.  The value, especially to newcomers to KMD and to CC, of the documentation you are producing is immense.  Get out as much as you can I'd say!

[12-Oct-18 09:35 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo Do you think `blockchain dog` is relevant to what siddhartha was asking about 👆?

[12-Oct-18 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
If blockchain dog gamified walking your dog - sure.  Collect tokens, meet at a dog park etc.

[12-Oct-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops the blockreward from going to any arbitrary address, including a CC address

[12-Oct-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but it could be that some CC wont work properly if it is done, not sure this seems like a case where it could break some CC assumptions

[12-Oct-18 10:20 AM] Mylo#8306
OK thanks, something we can test in #kmdlabs

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
a new simple project for CC dev is to make a faucet that is configurable

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so like the rewards plan it would allow to be parameterized

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
first step is to define all the parameters

[12-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
then to implement it as faucet2

[12-Oct-18 10:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Parameters defining should be on pre-compile stage or on-chain when CC is deployed?

[12-Oct-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to develop a CC, you need to define it first, then develop support for it, then debug it, etc. maybe one of the new students will want to do this

[12-Oct-18 11:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, not going to do it - just was interesting about way of params define implementation

[12-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you need help, just ask your local simple CC designer

Hi, I'm trying to test out channels.  Is there any reason it wouldn't work on STAKED branch?

[14-Oct-18 01:11 AM] CrisF#3405
I've successfully created a channel.

[14-Oct-18 01:14 AM] CrisF#3405
```"Channel": "REPu3ou58hBBQvfR8q8fH5mZDB9PRDvyvF - 1 payments of 1000000000 satoshi - 74921db337f13bcb1b0cd3f0d024d2167b15b1ccc4d63338ed2091511448f575"```

Is jl777 branch good for that, or FSM?

@jl777c can you take a look at this? I know you said you'd come back to oracles once a couple bugs were pin pointed, but I'm having trouble figuring out the pattern here. The json always starts with the same pubkey and prints dupes of it in each

I'm going to focus on identifying as many oracles bugs as I can find, but I was hoping to get this fixed before i start doing that. `oraclesinfo` is hard to use in the current state, makes it hard to use in general without scripting to ignore the bug
