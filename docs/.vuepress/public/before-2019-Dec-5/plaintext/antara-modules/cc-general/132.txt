**Test CC on a Sapling Activated Chain**

**1.** Clone, fetch zcash sapling params and compile
```
git clone https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout FSM
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
**2.** Chain params
```
./komodod -ac_name=SPLTEST -pubkey=<yourpubkey> -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &
```

**3.** Start CC testing as you did before. Sapling is already activated on this chain. Just mine a block or two and use the funds.

P.S.: Make sure you use this specific repo as this already contains sapling activation code and no need for you to manually edit source and compile.

Can, anyone pin this please?

@CHMEX do you mind to setup an explorer for SPLTEST chain as well? it would be beneficial for the CC testing on sapling activated chain

@Decker can you look at cc/CCtx.cpp? it uses the built infunctions to make a tx, so hopefully it is a matter of changing a setting in the CMutableTransaction

[26-Nov-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the CC vouts are signed using the same cryptoconditions signing, so it must be the tx version (and the normal vouts that are not signed using sapling)

[26-Nov-18 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems all CC transactions have same 1 version now.
So seems `-regtest`  chain wasn't the best way to test CCs on sapling ü§ï

[26-Nov-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker I think the problem is     auto consensusBranchId = CurrentEpochBranchId(chainActive.Height() + 1, Params().GetConsensus());
it isnt updating based on the ASSETCHAINS_SAPLING, need to add a new epoch or something like that

Thank you very much again. Much appriciated üòÉ

[26-Nov-18 02:10 PM] SHossain#0007
you may need to update the daemon once we have fixes for the bug found.

[26-Nov-18 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
CC tests passing on `PirateNetwork`without errors as well, and daemon told me that sapling activated:
```SET SAPLING ACTIVATION height.61
REGTEST sapling activation at 61```
+ when I started `-regtest` not in tests framework (when daemon crashed) CCs worked fine. 
Just checked and sapling activating fine (transactions "version": 4) in regtest mode

[26-Nov-18 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
So `regtest` seems fooled me üò∞

[26-Nov-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
wait, so without -regtest, is there a problem or no?

[26-Nov-18 02:46 PM] SHossain#0007
the output i provided with normal mode. no regtest

[26-Nov-18 03:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hey guys, I have built KMD from master branch in order to run KMD node (I wanted to avoid sapling changes to maybe make some problems). But when I start the daemon I get :
`komodod: main.cpp:3640: void PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion `!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed.`

[26-Nov-18 03:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
Even tried with FSM branch to run pure KMD node: `komodod: chain.cpp:147: CBlockIndex* CBlockIndex::GetAncestor(int): Assertion `pindexWalk->pprev' failed.`

[26-Nov-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to -reindex it

[26-Nov-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
long standing bug, unreproducable

[26-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, will try to trnasfer chain from other node where it works. Reindex will last too long

[26-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Usually happens syncing on system with too low ram, or a bad quality VPS where ram was over provisioned and runs out.

[26-Nov-18 03:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Thnx üëç

[26-Nov-18 03:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, interesting. I have 4GB ram on that VPS, but I was compling while chain synced and was out of memory on build, and also saw in get info something about memory. Good I have one node which synced good

[26-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just use a boot strap yeah.. thats how we been doing staked notaries msotly, as they dont need that much ram to run.

[26-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
Bootstrap? Like transfering chain from other node?

Probably not IMO ... its not liek it takes 48H to sync

[26-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its really good for testing

[26-Nov-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but everyone should not use bootstrap...

ok. ignore my lpost then

[26-Nov-18 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
actually, it takes about 1.5 - 2 hours for a full sync for me

[26-Nov-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes with very fast internet its not bad ... I was inernet limited at 50Mibt on last sync here, and it took many hours... for a ~10GB chain, it pulled in somehting lilke 100GB or more of traffic...

@KNOX this is a good time to run the automated python tests in the PirateChain fork of komodo: `./qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions --tracerpc`

[26-Nov-18 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
if they don't pass, something is wrong

[26-Nov-18 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KNOX just some advice, that renaming the repo to `pirate-komodo` or `pirate` makes more sense, so that somebody can clone `komodo` and this pirate version of KMD into the same directory. Right now, I have to choose a custom name for it. And because I already have hundreds of repos, and every person will make their own name for the repo, it's just not ideal

[26-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c @miketout Hey guys, I just figured out tokenconvert RPC is missing from the new FSM after sapling changes are added. Before there was rpcserver.cpp in src directory, but now I see it is moved to rpc/server.cpp and tokenconvert is not there. I'm worried that maybe something else is could also slipped with new changes...

i think when you do a pull request, anything else missing will come back?

[26-Nov-18 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
depends on how branches branched from each other, and which branch you are sending the PR to

[26-Nov-18 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
```src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
6864:UniValue tokenconvert(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp)

[26-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Mihailo#5902

[26-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
My worries are that merging the changes for sapling was used from some other branch that could had some other stuff missing...

[26-Nov-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, if it happened to 1 RPC, it probably happened to more than 1

[26-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Mihailo#5902

[26-Nov-18 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
