as long as the RNG of rogue can be used, then there is no problem. everytime you get a random number, the next one is calculated. there is no need to go back to high entropy source for each random number

[08-Mar-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
1000 rogue games will take a second or two to replay, tetris I imagine will be faster

[08-Mar-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst we would need to make longer blocktimes

[08-Mar-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
let us not overengineer things. zksnarks? math that is very hard to understand, fancy other things... not the best thing to start with such complex things

[08-Mar-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
I always start with the simplest possible solution

[08-Mar-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
often it is good enough and then I am done

[08-Mar-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, then I step it up to the next level of complexity and I stop as soon as the problem is solved. this ends up with arguably the simplest solution that solves the problem

[08-Mar-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, it is good to have bazooka, emp, hellfire missles in your toolkit, but if a flyswatter is all that is needed, just use that

[08-Mar-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the only issue about tetris that is different than rogue (other than tetris is MUCH simpler gameplay) is that not doing anything creates an event. that is the only real difference, so I dont expect there to be much different in the solution. maybe just just run length encoding of keystrokes

[08-Mar-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
do not overengineer things, especially blockchain logic

[08-Mar-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it has to be dead simple, else it wont ever consensus

[08-Mar-19 07:38 AM] Alright#0419
will every rogue node validate every game? same seed, same inputs, same result?

[08-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
"will" ?? they have been since early blocks

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the blockchain consensus concept applied to rogue

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
terribly inefficient, but impossible to cheat

{Reactions}
😂 

[08-Mar-19 07:45 AM] Alright#0419
Does a tetris game in this situation need randomness every 7 in-game blocks or just a single seed of entropy to start a game?

[08-Mar-19 07:46 AM] Alright#0419
I keep explaining this concept to joker(same seed, same input, same outcome), and he is convinced it's impractical to code game logic into consensus for every single node

[08-Mar-19 07:50 AM] Mylo#8306
game logic is logic.
crypto condition logic is logic.
wallet logic is logic.
it is all logic.   the faucet logic goes around in a loop until a transaction ends in 00 to stop leechers.
game logic is just to replay.  not in realtime.  super fast.

[08-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Mylo#8306
tetris.  who knows.  maybe the game was written in a time when computing 50k random numbers was expensive for cpu & ram.

[08-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
>impossible to cheat
I think it's the opposite? Die? Submit a different set of keystrokes in which you didn't die

[08-Mar-19 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im just thinking about games that are far more complex than these... it does not seem possible to replay every game with a fuill block to me.. maybe im wrong but doesnt seem to make a lot of sense

[08-Mar-19 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
if you limit this window in which you can "rewrite" the keystrokes, we limit cheating

[08-Mar-19 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
but no matter what, it's possible

[08-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
still the keystrokes submitted needs to have been played

[08-Mar-19 07:53 AM] Mylo#8306
i had this cheating argument at hte beginning of the week.   you're gonna lose 😄

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you might be able to implement a limited undo, but with a time constraint there wont be time to redo things in any significant ways

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the game can be replayed in a few seconds.... just use that code to play games in a microsecond over and over again until you win ?

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
I can cheat. I will cheat if you want me to demonstrate it

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you can cheat rogue?

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
Do believe I can

[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you can create arbitrary player data and have the network accept it?

[08-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
No, if I die, i can undie

[08-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Mylo#8306
mod the buffer?

[08-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
the network would never see me dying

[08-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Mylo#8306
ah no broadcast?

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
I think this window in which you can rewrite your mistakes will always exist in CC blockchain games

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
we need to limit this window as much as possible

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but you still need the actual gameplay keystrokes that wins

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
with rogue, keystrokes sent every level

[08-Mar-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can prevent being killed by the Troll, but with a time limit it could be that you cant create a winning keystrokes in time and that is death too

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
forgery of playerdata is doublespending

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
delaying of dying is reorging

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you can delay your death, but you cant create a win, unless you actually win

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] Mylo#8306
if keystrokes were mapped to a channelsCC-style of firing off tx, then streaming actions on the blockchain be possible?

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
ok, how about if i die, I rewrite the keystrokes to bail out instead of dying?

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
I claim the gold that is currently on me and restart

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
and bail before dying, fiddling with the buffer of keystrokes.

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you can reorg the keystrokes

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but the valid keystrokes must still be created

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
bailing out is a valid set of keystrokes and you didnt create gold out of nothing, you had the gold

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe death shouldn't give you 0 gold?

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Mylo#8306
take a ticket from a queue, the ticket and the keystroke are now bound.  next ticket from queue next keystroke bound to it.  throw them all  together in a ticket/receipt style hash.   hard to undo...surely

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it matters so much either way

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Alright#0419
because a hacker can make it give themselves the amount of gold they had accrued?

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
which translates to 0.3 ROGUE coins.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
I can see the cointelegraph article now

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
take for example the potion thing, we can see them all because a hacker can see them all

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
scroll*

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
hacker mods the rogue game and earns an extra 0.3 ROGUE coins

[08-Mar-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
this can be solved with a separate p2p network of nodes confirming keystroke by keystroke

[08-Mar-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and that would close this keystrokes reorging

[08-Mar-19 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
keystokes reorging is not the problem

[08-Mar-19 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
the difference between doing and not doing it is

[08-Mar-19 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
if we nerf the difference, it's fine

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess if dying was the same as bailing out that makes keystrokes reorging pointless

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I havent played rogue... but ive played rogue likes and usually when you die there is just some penalty... you dont lose everything

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but I am pushing toward preventing keystrokes reorging

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
faster timeouts

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
that is a good solution

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
with ROGUE you have the playerdata that we want to have a market for

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
you could have 10 seconds to replay something

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
if you don't come up with a winning outcome in those 10 seconds, you die

[08-Mar-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if people didnt lose their player data, there wouldnt be much demand for buying playerdata

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, currently the time limit is 60 blocks

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
can be shorter

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
that is a good game mechanic 😂

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] Mylo#8306
you can have players die have a reducing multiplier effect.   e.g. play again and when you find a 10gold, it is only worth 0.9 gold.   each time you die you are reduced in rewards of packages in game?

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
if you die, you have N seconds to unkill yourself

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just have a penalty for dieing...

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its much simpler

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to implement realtime keystrokes verification

[08-Mar-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and keep the gameplay the way it is

[08-Mar-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
having a market for playerdata is a key part of the experiment

[08-Mar-19 08:11 AM] Mylo#8306
hash(ticket(randomnumber) + keystroke), next ticket uses the hash as random number.

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] Mylo#8306
+ timeout i guess?

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, there still isnt much tx validation, so preventing keystrokes reorg is not at the top of the list to fix

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
in general you proritize things by how important they are against the other things

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
keystrokes reorg is maybe in the top 10, but just barely

[08-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
it's not even a "reorg" it's simply not submitting keystrokes when you die

[08-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
and replaying them so that you don't die

[08-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Mylo#8306
fun to read anyway.  i got `forgery of playerdata is doublespending` and  `delaying of dying is reorging` out of this exchange, 🙏

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Mylo#8306
does it invalidate the "uncheatable" statement though.  i think this is what @Alright  is targeting.

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
my point is

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
level out the playing field between cheaters and non-cheaters

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Mylo#8306
it's  a solvable problem, just "barely" top 10 😄

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
no matter how that affects gameplay

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Alright#0419
it just becomes a unique game

[08-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
it might not be "rogue" but it's "blockchain rogue"

[08-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe today isn't they day for this line of conversation.  i gotta go anyways.
