Did you notice any issues with the Dice contract?

[19-Aug-18 05:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I noticed that I win less than expected when increase the odds. For example for odds 5 I get result not fit the 3 sigmas which have a 0.3% probability

[19-Aug-18 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
There are two options as I think: 1) I'm a super unlucky guy 2) Win probability calculating not totally as we expected for a such model

[19-Aug-18 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
But I'll collect at least 500 bets for each odds to be more sure

@jusoaresf  how are you doing?

[20-Aug-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL very good data! The algo I use is:
    if ( odds > 1 )
        bettor = (bettor / arith_uint256(odds));
which I guess leads to some sort of binomial decay. I will need to research a bit how to get hash compares to map to odds

[20-Aug-18 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
thanks for a feedback @jl777c I'll also try to understand where problem in algo might be

[20-Aug-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure the reason is that each bit is independent

[20-Aug-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and dividing linearly doesnt match the odds.

[20-Aug-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
I have two hash values of 256 bits each. where each bit is high entropy random

[20-Aug-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it has to do with diff calculation: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty

[20-Aug-18 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Just add more 0 in case of increased odds?

[20-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i think to convert the hash to a difficulty and then divide one by the odds will do the trick

[20-Aug-18 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577

[20-Aug-18 10:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL are you assuming a gaussian distribution of bets to come up with your "probability to get out of 3 sigmas" ?

[20-Aug-18 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto I assume binomial distribution

[20-Aug-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the variation seems to be way off. i changed to match what dice sites use

[20-Aug-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
take 20 bits of hex, if less than a million mod with 10000 and compare against that

[20-Aug-18 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if >= million, use the next 20 bits

[20-Aug-18 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Which with high n -> to normal (or Gaussian) distribution

[20-Aug-18 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So yes in general 😃

[20-Aug-18 10:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think i can cook up some automated tests that we can run and calculate these stats, and the tests will fail unless results are within a specified number of sigmas

{Reactions}
👌🏽 

[20-Aug-18 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
It would be great I think

[20-Aug-18 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @TonyL and @dukeleto 😃

[20-Aug-18 10:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
they will probably be pretty slow, just gonna say. Because I will need to broadcast and mine a regtest block for each bet,unless I can create 500 betting raw transactions, broadcast them all, and mine them in one block. Not sure if that's possible

this BOLT chain, what is it?

[20-Aug-18 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, actually I found that confirm_bets.sh script not needed since you're getting bet result immediately after rawtransaction broadcasting without dicefinish

[20-Aug-18 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto i moved away from ATx prefiex just thought it was more solid (after a lot of hardforking changes)

[20-Aug-18 10:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
life has been keeping me very busy and I haven't kept up with all the backlog in this channel 🍿

[20-Aug-18 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
and started **BOLT**

[20-Aug-18 10:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
cool

[20-Aug-18 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
in hope that it will survive a longer than the earlier onces before we hardfork again

[20-Aug-18 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
and tried a different name 😃

[20-Aug-18 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
And this is a pushing monkey.sh script which I've used: 
```
BANANA=0
while [ $BANANA -lt 60 ]; do
./place_bets.sh
sleep 60
let BANANA=BANANA+1
done
```

[20-Aug-18 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
It's better to combine all in one script for sure I think 😃

[20-Aug-18 10:54 AM] dukeleto#7326

[20-Aug-18 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Great, I advice first to run some script which increase entropy by sending transaction to dice CC each block

[20-Aug-18 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
In such case you'll able to collect data much much faster

[20-Aug-18 10:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
nothing fast about the tests

[20-Aug-18 10:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
😃

[20-Aug-18 10:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
needs to be fixed, but we must mine test blocks in our tests to do a xtn, that makes stuff slow

[20-Aug-18 10:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
randomness may be an issue

[20-Aug-18 11:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Alright, I'll send my monkey to gamble a little anyway and then we'll be able to compare our results for this new dice code @dukeleto

@jl777c if you have advice to avoid the `EVAL_FAUCET Invalid: faucet is only for brand new addresses` error in my tests, that would be helpful. I read the code that generates the error but I don't quite understand

[20-Aug-18 11:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
the 🌅 is coming, so I should probably sleep

[20-Aug-18 11:34 AM] SHossain#0007
only way i know is, you need to restart the daemon with different pubkey and imprort the privkey (make sure your address has 0 tx of any kind) and use `faucetget`

[20-Aug-18 11:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
that seems pretty inconvenient

[20-Aug-18 11:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
both manually and in our tests

[20-Aug-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
this was to discourage faucet leechers

[20-Aug-18 11:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
well, we could turn off that check in regtest mode, is one option. which has pros and cons

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[20-Aug-18 11:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
it made my passing test suite fail, and getting around it requires a lot of work

[20-Aug-18 11:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
best ROI is to disable that check in regtest mode. Which makes sense, in regtest, we control all nodes => no need to worry about evil faucet leeches

[20-Aug-18 11:41 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you are right

[20-Aug-18 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
some pedantic testing person might argue "then it makes it hard to test that particular evil faucet leech condition in regtest mode"

[20-Aug-18 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
