i didn't test `faucetget`

[28-Nov-18 07:45 PM] axo777#1232
Hi All,  I am looking for help in putting together a UI something like the swagger.io demo where you write API's on their webpage.  I want a tool that will interface to the rpc where the user can "fill in the blanks" to create his own Oracle CC to put IoT data on the blockchain.

@SHossain `faucetget` worked.

[28-Nov-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
great.

[28-Nov-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
that means first 4 CC is mostly working

[28-Nov-18 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
except the verify error you found.

[28-Nov-18 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm still testing the rewardsunlock.

[28-Nov-18 07:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[28-Nov-18 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
no.

[28-Nov-18 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007

A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid.  This needs to get done first

[28-Nov-18 08:04 PM] axo777#1232
There should be a way to get data from a smart phone and upload it to the oracle CC

[28-Nov-18 08:07 PM] axo777#1232
A googlemaps API is another data source we can tap into

Is anyone around that can provide feedback on the gateways cc?

There is an rpc call, gatewaysinfo, for which I need more information.

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/komodo-docs-vuepress/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-gateways.html#gatewaysinfo

Look in the returned values and you'll see four === signs.

Those are the values for which I need some explanations about what they are and what they do.

taddr, prefix, prefix2 are the coin specific address prefixes that are customizing the address for bitcoin vs. KMD vs LTC,e tc

[29-Nov-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain I think you had your parameters reversed for the rewardsunlock:
"method": "rewardsunlock",
    "params": [
        "RWX",
        "8a4bb8b558dc47561e58f4eeaa5af3521689c3c32fbbf390e4975def396b4c7a",
        "c7c36c2689091103ab50e46967df354dfa63de41af4ed9c71accb96895801791"
    ]
c7c36c2689091103ab50e46967df354dfa63de41af4ed9c71accb96895801791 is the fundingtxid

[29-Nov-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
reverse them and it should work

[29-Nov-18 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so the only known issue seems to be dealer node doing a dice status with a specific bettxid

[29-Nov-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers @jorian does the sapling activated chain support things well enough so KMDICE will run properly? wondering if there is a new bug, or it is just a currently unused case that has a bug

[29-Nov-18 09:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Today i will update to latest FSM and restart the dealer node.

the blockchain dog mention is in that blog post from FBF (five bullet fridays)

[30-Nov-18 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Have an idea to make alternate RPC tests package  (maybe as TUI and separate module) after this situation with regtest and CC
Just use as RPC connection with one of the existing chains same as I'm doing in TUIs
```rpc_connection = Proxy("http://%s:%s@%s:%d"%(ip, rpc_user, rpc_password, port))```
So will possible to run same tests on any existing chain in "combat" conditions. Or run a new chain with needed params and run tests on it.

[30-Nov-18 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you think it's worth?

[30-Nov-18 06:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL sounds like you want to run tests against an already-running chain? sounds like a useful option

[30-Nov-18 06:57 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Yes, so we'll not need to hardcode chain params and even if we'll need to test few chains with different params it'll be a quite easy + possibility to test any production asset chain

[30-Nov-18 06:57 AM] TonyL#3577
This situation when something worked well in regtest but not worked at all on non regtest chain made me paranoid üòÇ

[30-Nov-18 06:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL make it so defining an environment variable like RPC_TEST_URL=.... makes running the regtests use that instead. Just a point of warning tho, existing tests are very tied to the regtest chain, and check for exact numbers of blocks/etc.. You will need to write tests in such a way to deal with that.

[01-Dec-18 01:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It worked on one machine, but the other is having more issues.

When I run `make clean`, I get this:

I asked in support yesterday, but haven't found an answer so far.

Searched on Google and found some suggestions from a thread where Luke-Jr was involved, but none of the solutions I tried worked.

[01-Dec-18 11:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm,  Is it a feature that all mining rewards going to pubkey which I've set as `-pubkey=` daemon param?

Noticed that after starting a fresh chain and mining 100+ blocks I have 0 balance. Investigated:
By mistake left pubkey from different asset chain start as `-pubkey=` and in block generating tx vout funds went to address which was valid to this pubkey on different chain

That only works on setpubkey rpc, and that RPC is in all komodods I am pretty sure

[02-Dec-18 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL a given pubkey is valid on any KMD chain, and even on any coin that uses the same curves. There are use cases where a node sets -pubkey but does not have it imported locally, I guess. Maybe some kind of startup message like "pubkey is not in local wallet" would be useful
