The more I learn about UTXOs, the more broken coins without them seem. @grewalsatinder ETH people assume there is "global state" for smart contracts, and so I think that is why "stateless" is like a "bad word" to them, it don't jive with their ecosystem

[18-Feb-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
CC seems to have plenty of state to me. the hard part is properly constraining the vin/vout to make validation as simple as possible

[18-Feb-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the traditional way of looking at smart contracts is too limited?

[18-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Mylo#8306
Maybe because dapps need a state.  Apart from a wallet being completely stateful, not many further dapps exist with utxo only.


Cannot write many dapps with utxo only, but CC opens up a whole new world of possibilities as we‚Äôve seen already in 6 months of half a handful of devs working on it.

[18-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Mylo#8306
CC solves it because any object can be encoded to the CCvout format.  Objects have state through their mutable fields which are exposed by RPC methods (like getters and setters and general functions)

[18-Feb-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
opreturn

[18-Feb-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
plenty of room for state info in opreturn

[18-Feb-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess if you look at pure definition of utxo, there is no opreturn

[18-Feb-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i prefer to look at what is possible

So $KMD accidentally invented Proof-of-Gameplay and you can now earn coins by proving your skills, which can be independently verified via the public blockchain. Another amazing application of CryptoConditions! $HUSH will also get CryptoConditions support, more details soo...

i have a problem i'd like to solve with a CC.

1.  i don't like claiming my 5% active user.
2.  i'd like to send funds to a myCC address and they are safe there (locked)
3.  i'd like the funds in (2) released back to original sender address when another deposit is made of more than 1 KMD e.g. 1.0005 from the same originating sender address
4.  whilst funds are locked, i'd like to periodically send a tx less than 1 KMD e.g. 0.0005 to myCC to check if 10k blocks has passed since last activity on the funds, and if so, claim the 5% reward.

possible?

[22-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Mylo#8306
if possible, would rewardsCC be the best place to read the code to build "LazyActiveUserCC" ?

[22-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo not sure I understand, but if it relies on CCs being on KMD itself, it will not work

[22-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
KMDCC will not have rewards

[22-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Mylo#8306
ah true.  thank you!

[22-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be too hard to do automated offline signing

[22-Feb-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
just seems unnecessary as it's *active* user rewards

[22-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Mylo#8306
trying to safely be lazy and write a useful CC, kill 2 birds with one stone.

[22-Feb-19 03:32 PM] Alright#0419
would recommend hyper ledger claiming app for lazy + safe rewards claiming

Would recomend BASIC commands.....go to...if then....OR you can write in HEX ...my though is make a new language for everyone forever.  Make it BASIC

[23-Feb-19 04:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I want to write a CC too!!

[23-Feb-19 04:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
A  CC not in*

[23-Feb-19 07:26 AM] Mylo#8306
C++ has all that

[23-Feb-19 07:27 AM] Mylo#8306
Just a little steeper learning curve.  Someone will make an interpreter one day

[23-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is not for weekend coders

[23-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
use the rpc calls of existing CC, that is for weekend coders

[24-Feb-19 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
at the speed new CCs are coming out, most people will choose from a large selection of existing CCs and customize them, maybe even with a GUI builder. Very few people will need to write custom CC's

[24-Feb-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct

[24-Feb-19 01:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Can also look at the other way, tehy are so easy to make... anyone can use the existing as example to make their own.

[24-Feb-19 01:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
"anyone" that is a developer that can mess with Makefiles and c++

[24-Feb-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Managed to learn how to do it in a year ü§∑

[24-Feb-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess it depsnds what you want to do though hey

[24-Feb-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think dynamically loadable cclib is the perfect fit, for those that want to dive deep in custom CCs

[24-Feb-19 01:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are easier too, from what I have seen testing musig

[25-Feb-19 02:07 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
This is what im talking about in my own language

[25-Feb-19 02:11 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
If each CC is broken down in Basic steps i think customization "could" become easy with a CC builder. /gui builder - thanks @dukeleto duke for semi understanding where im headed with my concept

[26-Feb-19 03:25 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Hi all, I have been testing the `musig` CC doing the Dilitihium rpc commands, but I want to generate some test coins, I can't seem to cpu mine it using `-gen` with `genproclimit=-1`

[26-Feb-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
@josephnicholas GMT+8 do you have multiple nodes running?

[26-Feb-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
a node will not mine if it's not connected to at least one other node

[26-Feb-19 03:32 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh okay, I just have one node running, since it is a new asset chain, so I will have to create another node?

[26-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
yes or use regtest mode

[26-Feb-19 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
would not recommend regtest for CC testing

[26-Feb-19 04:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
we do have CC regtests, tho

[26-Feb-19 04:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
but regtest is not mainnet

[26-Feb-19 04:12 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Understood, I am renting a VPS for testing, thanks @Alright

[26-Feb-19 04:13 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@dukeleto maybe I will try that as well, since its better for simulation purposes

[26-Feb-19 04:13 AM] Alright#0419
I have a chain I'm testing dilithium with right now, would you like to just connect to it?

[26-Feb-19 04:13 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
do we have a special RPC call to do CC regtests?

[26-Feb-19 04:13 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
That would be perfect

did you do `./makecclib` prior to build.sh?

[26-Feb-19 04:18 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yeah, I have a question, just ran the daemon but no connected nodes

[26-Feb-19 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
what p2p port does it show when you run it?

[26-Feb-19 04:28 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
51092

[26-Feb-19 04:31 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@Alright how do I make my VPS as node to connect to? or is it automatic?

[26-Feb-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
that is the correct p2p port for this chain

[26-Feb-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
no errors or anything in stdout or debug.log when you tried to connect?

[26-Feb-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
maybe just leave it running for a few minutes?

[26-Feb-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand your question

[26-Feb-19 04:35 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So I tried what you have said earlier about running 2 nodes to enable mining. So I created 1 node in my mac, and another one in a VPS. Then I ran the VPS daemon, then I connected my my daemon running in my mac to my VPS daemon, using -addnode=<VPS> IP, but it doesn't connect.
Should I add `-listen` or `-connect` flags?

[26-Feb-19 04:41 AM] Alright#0419
you must open the p2p port

[26-Feb-19 04:41 AM] Alright#0419
curious why you chose to start with dilithium testing

[26-Feb-19 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
there are much less complex CCs if you're just looking to get a general feel for how they work

[26-Feb-19 04:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904

start a new chain 
then start a separate node with something like this appended to the chain params

```

[26-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Alright#0419
it will run two instances of the daemon

[26-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli` will work with the daemon that has default rpc port set

[26-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
you'll need to use curl to interact with the other daemon

[26-Feb-19 05:00 AM] Alright#0419
does that make sense?

[26-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419
not quite?

[26-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Alright#0419

open another terminal and do

`./komodod -ac_name=MYCHAIN -ac_supply=999999 -ac_reward=1000000000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_cclib=soduku -datadir="/<user>/.komodo2" -rpcport=1234 -listen=0 -addnode=127.0.0.1`
