every cc rpc i try gives this same error. and i tried my NN pubkey, still no bueno

[06-Aug-18 07:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
the code doesn't even check that the pubkey is valid really, just if it exists

[06-Aug-18 07:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
or that addressindex has been enabled. But perhaps -regtest disables addressindex. just a guess

[06-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Mylo#8306
my docker image with pubkey=033aceKMDPIONEERS -regtest -cc=1 could return faucetinfo last week.
not sure if it does what you're after though, but it did return "success" from cli

[06-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Mylo#8306
as in real NN pubkey

[06-Aug-18 07:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
where is that repo again?

the new test file needs to learn how to create an asset chain in the test suite, where the python tests can interact with it. then we can start to add various unit tests and more complex tests to make sure all the RPCs work as expected. Just a bit more plumbing is needed

[06-Aug-18 07:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
and then we can hook this up to travis CI too

[06-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah that's 'very efficient' testing - not just rpc calls in a bash script üòÉ

[06-Aug-18 07:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
we can test very complex stuff with the Python test framework. There is also C++ unit tests, but those are kind of annoying to write and annoying to run and therefore less pragmatic for us. We will get more ROI from Python tests

[06-Aug-18 07:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, in the framework, there is already functions to call so you can spin up N nodes and mine certain amounts of blocks on each and have them be in a very particular state, just before your test runs, things like that

[06-Aug-18 07:46 AM] Mylo#8306
that's handy.  probably easier for someone to pick up python tests than cpp tests just because of language selection as well (hence why ppl have bothered to do handier stuff with py perhaps?)

[06-Aug-18 07:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
C++ are "unit tests" where Python are called "QA" tests which some people would call "integration" tests

[06-Aug-18 07:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
because they test multiple things at once, not just individual functions. the line is blurry

[06-Aug-18 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
blurry yes but makes sense if higher level stuff has been done in python i guess

[06-Aug-18 07:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's easy to describe complex stuff in Python, it's flexible, and easy to write + maintain tests in it. It's considered an additional layer on the c++ unit tests. The c++ unit tests would be like "let's test the foo RPC function with 99 different kinds of function arguments to do the right thing every time"

[06-Aug-18 07:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
where Python is like "make sure this bug doesn't happen when this complex situation arises"

[06-Aug-18 07:49 AM] Mylo#8306
yep gotcha

self.nodes[0,1,2,3] are regtest komodo nodes running under the test suite

[06-Aug-18 07:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
and you can run RPC functions on them like `self.nodes[0].getnewaddress()`

[06-Aug-18 07:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can override `setup_network` to create your own kinds/numbers of nodes, like the wallet.py test : https://github.com/letolabs/komodo/blob/752791ae3dc1c0b1c9f6d6c5179acda189d4d5cb/qa/rpc-tests/wallet.py#L22

what i still need to do in my `cctests` branch is teach the test framework about kmd-specific things, like -ac_* params, and a way to control them easily so you can easily create AC's for tests. Right now the test suite only knows how to create regtest `komodod` nodes

[06-Aug-18 08:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am going to sleep soon, hopefully tomorrow I can sort out why I get the annoying `to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet` error and get some actual cc tests running

[06-Aug-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
`./qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions` is how to run the test in my branch if anybody wants to play with it

[06-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Mylo#8306
validateaddress and stuff works as expected.  regtest mining 150+ blocks to test sending to faucet and stuff.

doesn't surprise me.  back in telephony, bsd was last to get anything

[06-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe i have to regtest with proper kmd params like 100m supply.  my ATEST chain didn't generate any mining rewards

[06-Aug-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
I added smart utxo selection to the CC tx creation for normal utxos. the CC utxos are usually limited in what they can be so not sure it is worth adding to all the CC specific CCutxo selection

[06-Aug-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this change should result in smaller rawtx,but there is a chance maybe I broke some things

[06-Aug-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully not as I want to restrict changes to bug fixes for the 1 million hardfork

[06-Aug-18 11:07 AM] Mylo#8306
```komodod -regtest -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_cc=1 -pubkey=033ace50aedf8df70035b962a805431363a61cc4e69d99d90726a2d48fb195f68c``` seems to break getting a balance after 101 blocks and mining rewards after that.
```
komodod -regtest -ac_supply=100000000
```
has mature 100m coins at block 100+ and mining rewards from 101 onwards no probs.

So i can't fund a faucet on kmd-regtest, nor any other regtest-ACs

[06-Aug-18 11:12 AM] Mylo#8306
addressindex=1 & spentindex=1 when included in that first `komodod` command also have same result.

[06-Aug-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
-regtest mode is needed?

[06-Aug-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and what does " seems to break " mean?

[06-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Mylo#8306
-regtest is very much needed.  it uses the ~/.komodo/regtest data.  without `-regtest` it doesn't know it's in regtest mode.  regtest mode is handy for app developers because app/front-end developers are not sys.admins or backend architect-types.

yes regtest mode is needed for the python integration testing duke is working on and also for enabling app developers & students to "start kmd and call rpc from their apps in less than 10 minutes without needing to install a full blockchain node on their workstation AND most importantly being able to generate blocks at their own devleopment pace"

`s/seems to break/breaks`.  it breaks the generation of coins in regtest mode - so being broken cannot test AC smart contracts like CCfaucet because no coins to transfer to faucet.

to quote @dukeleto  from about 5 hours earlier
```
we can test very complex stuff with the Python test framework. There is also C++ unit tests, but those are kind of annoying to write and annoying to run and therefore less pragmatic for us. We will get more ROI from Python tests
for instance, in the framework, there is already functions to call so you can spin up N nodes and mine certain amounts of blocks on each and have them be in a very particular state, just before your test runs, things like that

```
hope that helps a bit why regtest mode is needed for other type of dev

i am reading the new reddit AMA: ```
ETH has the truffle framework for building contracts, komodo has in built contracts for common use cases. ETH has the ganache tool for test mode so a developer can run their own node in isolation on their computer running at their own pace (e.g. generate a block every second if they want to emulate)

I‚Äôm testing an equivalent for komodo. Further, I‚Äôm testing packaging it up so a new dev at any skill level can be up and running in <10 minutes in their own self contained environment.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMylo Mylo```

[06-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes.  For app developers to not have to muck around with systems ‚úÖ

[06-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Mylo#8306
When they have most of their app working in private, they can move to a live blockchain.
