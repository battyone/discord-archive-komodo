[12-Oct-18 05:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We've already talked to thebot dev.,   He is adding an option to remove the rain spam.   And increase the minimum amount.   So if they wanna spam the net, at least it's worth it.

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] CombatWombat#0279
some people don't like the notifications i got everything on silent so i dont mind lol

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] C Adi#8432
@FishyGuts It was worth it for me. I'm up a whole nickel and had a good lol

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't mind them but some people do.

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah mute this channel if you mind the notifications

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This is a place of business for a lot of people (at least 20-30)

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] CombatWombat#0279
i think like in tipsy bot how there is an option to remove the tags

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
mute the bot.

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
it is nice. but sending 0.005 to hundreds of users seems spam

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] B.B.#7184
doesn't stop de notification number though...

[12-Oct-18 05:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So we do want to respect that and treat it like such.  

As fast as the tipbot came in , it can go if the drizzle spam continues üòÉ

It's cool and we don't want to abuse the priveledge KMD allowed us by adding it.

@AndronicusBass why am i rude?

[12-Oct-18 05:07 PM] stretcher83#6535
Sorry guys and gals i dont see the point of adding a tip bot if you are going to call it spam , üò©

[12-Oct-18 05:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
- Upping the min amount for rain and soak.
- Removing the notification tags for rain and soak 

@sclear üòÉ

[12-Oct-18 05:07 PM] B.B.#7184
I do appreciate the functionality, it's fun and all but when i see 20 notification i think it's important and then i just see it's the bot so it's a bit annoying

[12-Oct-18 05:07 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
I said 'quite rude' how are you rude?

[12-Oct-18 05:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
0.005 / 425 online people is spam.

[12-Oct-18 05:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We're going to have a min of 1 KMD for rain or soak to start

[12-Oct-18 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
