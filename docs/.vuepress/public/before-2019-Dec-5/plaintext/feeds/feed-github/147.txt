[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] Issue opened: #492 Currency should not be enabled if the \`electrum\` calls fails
When enabling the currency `OOT` using the `electrum` endpoint:

```
{
	coin: "OOT"
	method: "electrum"
	servers: [{url: "electrum1.utrum.io:10088"}, {url: "electrum2.utrum.io:10088"}]
	userpass: "…"
}
```

it fails with `500 (Internal Server Error)`, but the `get_enabled_coins` endpoint still returns `OOT`. `get_enabled_coins` should only return ones that were successfully enabled.

I would also like mm2 to return a proper error for the `electrum` endpoint than 500.

could be a good idea to use `server.version` with a min. protocol version 1.4 to the electrums, which would result in this answer

Hi! 

Aha, as I can see there was old mm2 version in this log so something doesnt update properly by play market "Update" button (we already working on updating process improvement)

Great that it work on your side now, I'm closing this issue.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #490: KMD\-RFOX swap failed with TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed and TakerPaymentRefundFailed
@tonymorony Hi, do you have application logs from runs when errors happened? I also need to know MM2 version which was used for these swaps, the old version fails the swap on first connection error, but newer retries many times.
Let's also use the `swap status` definition for `my_swap_status` or `stats_swap_status` outputs, `logs` should be used for GUI/MM2 console logging.

For first case I've requested app log but the user did not send them.

For LTC-KMD swap I got logs but there is no any information related to swap, mm2 version is `mm2] 22 09:20:39, lp_native_dex:1350] showwif.0 version: 7fc26ff` (it's an iOS and there is no fresher version for iOS yet)

Hi @bitcoinsfacil, thanks for your report! It's strange and rare case when transaction is sent in real but we get error from ETH node for some reason. We will investigate it. Also we will add the API to unlock the funds of the failed swap.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #490: KMD\-RFOX swap failed with TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed and TakerPaymentRefundFailed
The MM2 version is quite old, MM2 should swap more reliably after update. Also [API will be added to unstuck the funds](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/406)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #489: ETH\-VRSC swap failed with TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed
Should be some network issue as maker didn't receive taker payment data, but it's good that funds were automatically refunded. Let's keep this issue open for a while and see how often we will get such reports.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #492: Currency should not be enabled if the \`electrum\` calls fails
@sindresorhus Hi, thank you for report. When you have the RPC error please always provide the response body as it will contain error description. Status code doesn't contain any useful info for troubleshooting. The error is easily reproducible in this case, but it might be environment related so the response body and app logs might be very helpful.
@cipig It's good idea, however MM2 should work with protocol version 1.2, however utrum electrums return 1.2 as supported as I understand, but th...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] Issue opened: #493 Remove hardcoded list of coins that use dynamic fee estimation\.
If `coins` config doesn't have txfee or it's set to zero MM2 should start using fee estimation methods and calculate the fee based on transaction size. As of now it happens only for [BTC and QTUM](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L1670)

The withdraw transactions are OK, you sent from RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA to RKD8NjuLNrnqaFY9KRpU6MAWHeve9byjAA and the rest was returned to RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA, that is why the tx has 2 outputs.

I understand, but atomicdex display doesn't show the address where bulk of funds (the address input as destination) went to.

This creates the misconception that all funds were sent to self. User reported this when attempting to send to Binance (I linked them to tx on explorer to confirm it actually went there).

Hello @bitcoinsfacil Thank you for feedback.
Where do you think it is better to display minimal trade amount?
