[artemii235/SuperNET] Issue opened: #402 mm2\_lib restarts
As a GUI user I can log out from the app and log in with a different passphrase, in order to access a different set of wallets and addresses.

GUI implements this by issuing a `stop` RPC call and later re-starting the MM.

In mm2_lib we should support such restarts. In particular, `mm2_main_status` should return 3 after a re-start.

Sorry I don't remember, can we emulate the Raspberry Pi build environment?

> g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)
> Please submit a full bug report,

What kind of OS version and compiler is featured there?
Is that a standard distribution compiler or a separately installed version?

[artemii235/SuperNET] Issue opened: #403 Eliminate the difference between maker and taker orders on API level\.
In current MM2 code we still have old MM1 approach when we explicitly tell the MM to act as Maker (using `setprice` RPC method) or Taker (`buy/sell` methods). One of main MM2 goals is to provide UX similar to centralized exchanges and AFAIK there're no CEX that work this way. It's usually works this way:
1. Trader places an order.
1. If order matches another existing order the Trader is `taker`.
1. If order doesn't match any other it stays on orderbook (if it's not `fill or kill` order whi...

What if i don't want to be a taker? I always want to be a maker, regardless if my order would match or not. I would like to keep the logic of `setprice` like it was in mm1.

@cipig Good point, thanks! It's easy to keep `maker` only mode maybe with a bit of refactoring that will be required for new `buy/sell` logic.

[artemii235/SuperNET] Issue opened: #404 Generate and use unique DB path depending on passphrase\.
MM2 uses same DB dir per every passphrase which might cause problems for use case like `logout/login` in GUI apps. The data from previous passphrase might be mixed up with new one, so user will see e.g. swap history that shouldn't be displayed to him.

This enables payments plan to be paid by a contract, by setting a global scriptpubkey variable. Its an early implementation that works for PricesBet, but should be able to be expanded for other contracts with a bit of work.

Protocol defines the semantic of what we're doing. As MM developers we have the low-level knowledge of what's goin on and it is our task to share the gist of that knowledge in the API. Most GUI developers in turn defer to the API in their understanding of the system. Incongruencies in what the system does and what it says translate to unnecessary cognitive load and dissonance and tend to affect everyone and on every level of the system. Just my two cents.

I don't disagree (totally), just saying that imo having features is the job of the protocol and end-user UX is a totally different realm. I'm not sure it should be put off onto the protocol to decide logic of where the user fits (in reference to CEX experience) unless there's a reason-based belief that the majority of users will be cli.

Good point, one can argue that to make good decisions one should connect with the interested user groups first (e.g. in PDIA).

On the other hand, I've of an opinion that any task should have sensemaking information in it and not just the technical details (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), and the UX information in this issue might be in part of the sensemaking kind rather than a on-the-spot decision kind.

In MM1 the technical difference between the taker and maker was that...

There is also the financial/trading part of the story. The maker pays no dexfee in BarterDEX, only the taker. And i would only want to procide liquidity to a pair by posting bids/asks in the orderbook with a margin, but don't actively fill the orders. I just wanted to make sure there will still be a way to do this.

[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #398: Cancel a setprice order
The task is related to https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/403, the plan is to add something like `cancel_order`. `setprice/buy/sell` purpose is to `create` a new order, so I would agree that `setprice:0` as `cancel` might not look straight-forward and clear.

[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #403: Eliminate the difference between maker and taker orders on API level\.
There should be categories similar to CEX orders. Like market buy and market sell vs. Limit buy and limit sell orders. 

Market orders fill any order listed in the orderbook regardless of price or volume. It just fills the complete quantity you specify. In mm2 there is a limitation here because if your order is bigger than the first in line order listed you would need to establish communication with a different node and start a new swap for the rest of your market order.

[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #403: Eliminate the difference between maker and taker orders on API level\.
Also, in mm1 there was a limitation of order size by splitting utxos. In mm2, since utxos are not relevant anymore, if you do a setprice order the complete balance of the address is up for sale in just one swap. 

This can become a problem if not used properly.

I concur with @cipig that there should be a marketmaker mode available with orders on both sides of the orderbook and margin between sides.

You can vote as many times as you like, but it should not affect the results of the poll. Only the initial vote's value will matter. Is this not the case?

@artemii235 , the number of minutes in a day is 86400 / 60 = 1440. I wonder if `365 * 24 * 60`

@ArtemGr Yes, it might require some refactoring from our side I guess. As of now we `split` the stream (which consumes it) so IIRC we would need to drop `both` parts which are already `moved` to different handlers. I think that `drop on idle` is possible, but will require some refactoring that might be done after the `beta` as current `Electrum` implementation seem to work properly anyway.
