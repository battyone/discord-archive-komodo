[telegram] <PaulFDSD> 1 day left until the long awaited Binance pump.
The active member count is a lot higher than we expected. However, it is still a bit lower than the high times of Lion. With the current member count we can expect a great pump. Inviting more people will result in an even bigger pump. So, post about it on social media, forums etc.
Tomorrow we will explain our strategy.

[telegram] <Regnar> What always makes me laugh is when people see a project like Komodo and they agree it's an awesome project, team, and coin, but the price doesn't represent that. They then leave and sell their KMD or refuse to buy any...even after literally just coming to the conclusion that KMD is undervalued with huge and still realistic growth potential...

[25-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> No institutions are buying KMD, only retail..and retail chase pumps and dump coins that don‚Äôt have immediate gains. We will be pretty stagnant for a while until some random whale or institution comes in....or a random pump/dump
