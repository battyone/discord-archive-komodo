[telegram] <KryptoKiwi_2> The Agama wallet was cracked. To be safe download the other Agama wallet which looks the same, called the same & has same shortcut. Once you can see those changes coins are safe.
Like teaching juniors all over again (re @KryptoKiwi_2: So there are 2 versions of the Agama wallet that look the same & called the same but are different. What Einstein thought to do that?)

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Why btc should not go to moon on long term if some wallet vulnerability is used to hack coins? It's got nothing to do with the fundamentals or blockchain. And in this case team showed outstanding level of professionalism and also responsibility to protect the investors and ecosystem. Technical fundamentals remain and we all know what is coming and how advanced komodo is. So let's just go to moon. (re @Skelet0r_1: Hack)

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Like I have said above I think that this whole Agama wallet hack can be also used for good, it has marketing value in the eyes of persons who understand what happened once you give them the facts. What other project would go so far to protect the investors? So I think once we are open about it and delivering all the news what is about to come --„Äãmarketing value. There is this saying that there is no bad publicity, all publicity is good as you are being talked about and here I think we can deliver some very positive comments based on the facts, instead of fud üëçüòä

follow instructions! namely send the special tx 2) to the claim address: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[08-Jun-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to also do the blockchain claim, there are two halves to the process. the claim form and the blockchain special tx 2)

[08-Jun-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763

@Heritic is it a normal tx, a special dust tx was sent to all compromised addresses. to make the blockchain claim, just send 0.0001 to your claim form address

[08-Jun-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to send the special tx 1) that was sent to you, so best way is to send all funds to the new address

[telegram] <lion_musk> I think first you need to return the funds to all victims of the attack.
