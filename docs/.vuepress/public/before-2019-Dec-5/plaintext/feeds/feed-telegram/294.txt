[12-May-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Technically 2. KMD doesn't move from 1 confirmation to 2 until it is notarized on BTC. 2 confs means its notarized. Notarizations happen every 10 minutes, so confirmations will likely be notarized before that (you could have confirmed a few minutes before the next notarization) (re @Marcauj: how many confirmations on KMD blockchain while 1 conf on BTC ?)

[telegram] <Acura360> Forwarded from Acura360: We have released new version of Agama 0.3.6. The updated version has a lot of changes and an improved UI to make it more user friendly. This version changes how you create new wallet in Lite or Native mode and the way you use Lite mode vs Native mode.
Direct login using seed or WIF key is no longer supported. You will need to use restore wallet feature first with existing seed or WIF.
Concurrent usage of native and lite mode coins is deprecated. From now on you can either run Lite mode coins or Native mode coins during one session.
Your coins selection is automatically stored when you add or remove coins.
Native mode coins can be started without creating an Agama wallet. Just add them using the login screen.
Following security best practices you must write down your seed in a safe place while creating a new account. Do NOT take screenshot or picture of your seed on a machine that is connected to internet.
We have updated guides on how to use the new lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024492-create-new-wallet-and-encrypt-seed-spv-
How to restore wallet with new Lite mode using seed/WIF https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026360-use-private-key-wif-or-seed-phrase-to-login-into-agama-lite-mode
Please find all Agama Desktop related guides here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/29000034534
If you have further questions please search the solutions page to find answers first before asking for help. In case you still need help, please visit #support-wallet channel where community and team members are constantly helping users in need. Alternatively, you can create a support ticket. A link to support help desk is available within Agama, just click on 3 lines (menu icon) on the top-right corner or Agama and select Support.

[telegram] <Regnar> Hmm okay i see what you mean. I don't have any VOTE to see if it works, but I was able to access the vote area and shown the VOTE dust I have left over (re @kapscedric: yes i vote with my wif key but i have acces to other vote token with public key of other)

[telegram] <Regnar> Just asked in Discord "users can login using R address, that is watch-only mode. they can't send funds using that. they need to login using seed/WIF to send funds out" (re @kapscedric: yes i vote with my wif key but i have acces to other vote token with public key of other)
