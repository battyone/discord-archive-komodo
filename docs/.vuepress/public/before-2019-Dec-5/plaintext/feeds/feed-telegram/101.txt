[telegram] <Xap99> 1 Zil for every 100 Komodo...
1:100 is not very good

[13-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Xap99> I wonder why the airdrops with Komodo aren't more in KMD's favor...

[13-Aug-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> 11 million total Zilla. So 4.7 is more than you think. (re @AsadKhan1953: What I am going to do with 4.7 zilla)

[telegram] <Hermes08> A critical update for some users that are maybe still on the older versions if you have version2.41 you are on the new version (re @tobiasnunes: So maybe it was not replaced (win version) or the announcement was just a repitition of the current version from July? Still not sure I got it)

[telegram] <Regnar> People always seem to not pay attention to coin supply. would you rather have 1 BTC or 1 Million Doge? (re @yorklab: 11 million total Zilla. So 4.7 is more than you think.)

[telegram] <bpetridis> no one gets market cap 😞

[14-Aug-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Xap99> Market Cap can make it seem diluted

[14-Aug-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Xap99> It's be like Komodo having 2 Billion total supply, but ¢.17...
the ginormous supply for some coins is unnecessary

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> for some coins yes, but there is a psychological factor to it. The perception of "cheap coins" being sub 1 cent or something and "expensive coins" being higher dollar denominations. Perception has a lot to do with it. (re @Xap99: It's be like Komodo having 2 Billion total supply, but ¢.17...
the ginormous supply for some coins is unnecessary)

[telegram] <Sean> waiting for 50 bucks to buy in rather than 5 cents?

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Zossabossa> So it didnt really matter if an Altcoin,
>Forked,Airdropped or Raised 10Million or 1Billion via ICO
>Has legit, fake or no partnerships
>Used by 100 or 1 million users
>Had a 750 IQ team or a Negative IQ team

Everything is down 90%⚰️

[14-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> But nobody has to trust me, if you studied the project where you invested and you know it, you haven't to be scary, the people that is selling out now is loosing a lot of money because invested without any previous study and they don't really know in which project they invested😂😂😂 they are simply scary, so if you don't read the whitepapers and check the roadmaps but just put money inside with the hopenes that you will do more money, you will crash

[telegram] <Acura360> If there is any lesson I could draw from my 5 years of crypto investing, it is to not watch the price. Watch the projects, buy into project opportunities (good teams, good ideas, room for improvement). Don't HODL at all cost, just look at the project and make your decisions based on what you see.✌🏼
