[telegram] <Snail> I would rather lost it And sell limonade To learn the harsh truth of life

[16-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> Tomorrow will be a better day

[16-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Snail> That your logic ...

[16-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> He should lost everything

[16-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Taner> +1 (re @Rafalloc: Tomorrow will be a better day)

[16-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> Yes, it was my fault to have buy komodo

[16-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> then better sell and stop crying here. Thank you (re @miguelborges99: Yes, it was my fault to have buy komodo)

[16-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> It was a big mistake for sure (re @miguelborges99: Yes, it was my fault to have buy komodo)

[16-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> For me, it is a question of principle. If it is not important to you, then it should be ok. But it doesn't seems so...

[16-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I will leave this talk

[16-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> i read only "mininime"

[16-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> How many kmd do you have? 2? (re @miguelborges99: For me, it is a question of principle. If it is not important to you, then it should be ok. But it doesn't seems so...)

[16-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> Think that could you have ZERO kmd (re @miguelborges99: For me, it is a question of principle. If it is not important to you, then it should be ok. But it doesn't seems so...)

[16-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I have revealed my name, my funds, and for me this was really bad.

[16-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I thought that komodo had good principles related to be anonymous in the space

[16-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I feel bad and disappointed

[16-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> Do not take me wrong

[16-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I had even to give my discord/email to get my funds back

[16-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> well, I will not discuss this issue any further

[16-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> But surely, it was not what I was thinking when I bought komodo

[16-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Can you show me a project which has paid back the user funds after a hack and had saved the user funds from the hacker?

[16-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I had a really good idea of this community and about the crypo spirit that they have

[16-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kremer (n k)> Seems like Komodo is an awful project. Sell and move on

[16-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> What I said, i said... If you did not like it, then it is your problem.

[16-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> You pay more than 0,8kmd on any eth or bitcoin transaction, this is ridiculous (re @Abdul: Actually hes right... no matter on how much he lost...)

[16-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Abdul> Thats not his point

[16-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Abdul> Not so hard to understand

[16-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rafalloc> He should lost everything so he would had really reasons to blame the team (re @Abdul: Thats not his point)

[16-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> If you actually read the EULA,  KMD didn’t have to do anything to get your coins back (re @miguelborges99: Is it your komodo? Is it? Put the komodo where it belongs and do not release shit software)

[16-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Komodo doesn’t have halvings

[16-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ghsalsaid> Komodo is a half by itself

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Use Verus Agama (re @loxal: How can I create a new Komodo address where I can transfer all my Komodo, SuperNET, BTC and other assets?)

[telegram] <loxal> I just download it but I cannot find a corresponding functionality there

[16-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Verus Agama is based off the original agama ( without the dependency ) , it is not the QT

[16-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loxal> ok, so Verus is more user-friendly than the Qt based wallet from Komodo and I still can manage all my assets?

[16-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yes

[16-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <CryptomanXX> Yes , it is your fault! It is a beta version of Agama, it tells you when you download, use it at your own risk so yes it is your fault, and stop bothering this awesome team of developers . They worked their ass off for day and night to fix and get kmd back from hackers. Stop fucken complaining!!!! (re @miguelborges99: if the hacker has it, is it my fault to have use your wallet?)
