[telegram] <stefan62280> i have one last üòÖ , if you're tired of answering i'll search myself lol‚Ä¶ what is the use of KMD coin in the coming dex ?

[28-May-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> It will be the base pair. Similar to how others buy BTC to purchase other coins.

[28-May-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Also, all fees are converted to KMD.

[telegram] <walkthelin> Looking to pick up some KMD. Was wondering if someone could provide link to explain the dex? And do KMD holders get profits from the exchange.. I‚Äôm really confused.. thank you

[28-May-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Mobile Dex beta is coming out soon, KMD holders do not get profits from dex.  DEX assetchain holders do
