[telegram] <Cryppto> So they ask 30-40 KMD for 1 DEX on Barterlly. That is ‚Ç¨62 per single DEX. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> 0.0001 per block)

[06-Jul-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> It is becoming more expensive than LTC soon. üòÇ

[06-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Iceman> Why big dump? :3

[06-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Because what's going up must go down... üòç

[06-Jul-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Iceman> Yes but this doesnt Look healthy too me (re @Cryppto: Because what's going up must go down... üòç)

[06-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Iceman> Run over?

[06-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <abrecords> Someone wants to buy more cheaper (re @Iceman: Run over?)

[06-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <abrecords> It is fine, the decline is not that big, will be recovered quickly i think

[06-Jul-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <abrecords> + there is still time till the 15th

[06-Jul-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Last Bullmarket the price was 58kmd for 1 DEX Asset (re @Cryppto: So they ask 30-40 KMD for 1 DEX on Barterlly. That is ‚Ç¨62 per single DEX.)

[06-Jul-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
and, KMD price was $12?

[06-Jul-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rick> We

[06-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> i think yes (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <SHossain> and, KMD price was $12?)

[06-Jul-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Without knowing how much income 1 DEX generates, it is difficult to establish any game plan. (re @Acura360: Last Bullmarket the price was 58kmd for 1 DEX Asset)

[06-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> I don't even know what wallet holds DEX since I never used Agama or any Komodo native wallet. üòÇ Just Magnum.

[06-Jul-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> yea this has been a silent rise.  Not much shililng from crypto twitter thankfully

[06-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Bitcoin spiked up and KMD had a bit of a run, so it's natural it would go down a bit. (re @Iceman: Yes but this doesnt Look healthy too me)

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> If AtomicDex has a succesful launch, it's really gonna be a game changer

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> really looking forward to it

[06-Jul-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> What are the plans to incentivise liquidity on the dex?

[06-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> They allegedly hired Donald Trump. He will tweet about how great AtomicDEX is and how it makes it easier for him to shuffle his profits into anonymized crypto holdings. üòÇ (re @McAttack77: What are the plans to incentivise liquidity on the dex?)

[06-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Iceman> 2k sats is a bit ? :3 (re @yorklab: Bitcoin spiked up and KMD had a bit of a run, so it's natural it would go down a bit.)

[06-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> lol (re @Cryppto: They allegedly hired Donald Trump. He will tweet about how great AtomicDEX is and how it makes it easier for him to shuffle his profits into anonymized crypto holdings. üòÇ)

[06-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> "AtomicAPI has a shared liquidity pool."
From the latest article on the AtomicDEX. 
If 5 different projects us the same AtomicAPI they all share the same liquidity pool. (re @McAttack77: What are the plans to incentivise liquidity on the dex?)

[06-Jul-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> This could dramatically increase liquidity.

[06-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> is there an incentive to hold KMD as an AtomicDEX user?

[06-Jul-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> From the decrypt article:
"Komodo initially plans to solve this by using market makers who will commit to buying and selling large amounts of coins on the platform."

[06-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> There was talk of having a 10% discounted dexfee for trading with KMD. (re @McAttack77: is there an incentive to hold KMD as an AtomicDEX user?)

[06-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> 12 usd will be good

[06-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be the one that is used the most for trading on atomicDEX. BTC can be traded, but its txfees are so expensive and its confirmation times too slow

[06-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD 1 minute blocktime is much better for trading

[06-Jul-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> so in theory, KMD will be the base trading pair on atomicDEX given the fee structure and speed of transactions.  So where BTC, BNB, or ETH are largely the base pairs on Binance, KMD will be the natural go to currency on the dex.  Am I thinking of this correctly?

[06-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly!

[06-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and having the best liquidity on atomicDEX means the best prices will be via KMD

[06-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
people could trade anything to anything, but only if there is an exact match for it

[06-Jul-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> thanks.  I know I'm asking simpleton questions, but just want to make sure I know what I'm shilling to people.

[06-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there are two coins ABC and XYZ, both not that active, then odds of two people who want to do the opposite of each others ABC <-> XYZ trade is very unlikely

[06-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
however, with liquid KMD markets, you can convert ABC to KMD and KMD to XYZ, and the other party can independently do the reverse

[06-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the net buying pressure on KMD is neutral, just more usage and this is the value creation

[06-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
being used as the intermediate coin in a swap, that alone creates value for KMD

[06-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <McAttack77> Understood.  What is the privacy level when using atomicDEX?  About the same at BTC transactions?

[06-Jul-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD becomes the coin to park funds in. then if a good deal is available in ABC (or XYZ) you can grab it. having any other coin than KMD means you are "farther away"

[06-Jul-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
all swaps are using transparent addresses

[06-Jul-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that being said, there is no KYC needed and all that is known is the pubkey

[06-Jul-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sunya0> Why isn't jl777c on telegram or Twitter or anywhere but discord btw?

[06-Jul-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
for chains with zaddrs, you can then go from the taddr into zaddr

[06-Jul-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
telegram requires a phone to register
