[telegram] <N21_0> yes it's too hard to make people accept tokens via services or good's, Nano try to do that also with cash back but who care !
that kinds of smart money need years to be helpfull in real life (re @bpetridis: No store is going to use a pos based on a token. Pos systems are so ingrained they are so difficult the change. If anything if they start accepting crypto as a payment method then komodo is the only platform that will handle point of sale volume.they just need ro link the existing pos to the kmd apis.)

[telegram] <bpetridis> We they might they just arent gonna rip out their entire POS system to accept a different payment method, dumb use case. Worked on some ecomm project linked to POS systems with bricks and mortar operations. No chance im hell they ever touch their pos, you build around it.

[telegram] <Cabey> KMD uses delayed proof of work so I'm theory it is as secure as Bitcoin. It borrows the enormous hash rate of Bitcoin.

[telegram] <Cabey> Almost as secure*
