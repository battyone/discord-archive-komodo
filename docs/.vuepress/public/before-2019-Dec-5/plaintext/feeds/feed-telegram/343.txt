first 70 special tx are sent to those with claims smaller than 7 KMD
if you are one of these, please let me know you got funds and then send to your claim address
I want to make sure the basic process works before scaling it up to all the < 7777 addresses

[telegram] <Cryppto> Hi. New here. Does anybody know what happened on March 27 this year? (Or possibly March 26.) The KMD volume on HitBTC skyrocketed on that day and never went back. Is some whale buying tons of KMD? Does anybody know? Any article to read?

[07-Jun-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
they started supporting 8 decimal places on BTC, instead of just 4

[07-Jun-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
before that it was 0.0002 vs 0.0003 type of prices available

[07-Jun-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it only took them 2 years to change it

[07-Jun-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> So I guess there were traders who moved to HitBTC from other exchanges to trade KMD after 8 decimal places became available at HitBTC. Interesting. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> they started supporting 8 decimal places on BTC, instead of just 4)

[07-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
more probably, hitbtc traders were able to make trades without losing 30% on the bid/ask spread, so they started trading more than when it was within percentages of a 0.0001 multiple

[telegram] <Cryppto> 3866, is that when Dick Allgire and CryptoViewers bought into Komodo? üòÇ

[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
3866 is when huobi had a (fatfinger) marketbuy that pushed prices to over 100k on huobi. so it was arbitrage against the huobi 100k+ buys

[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
people made a LOT of money on that arbitrage

[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
essentially 70k sats per KMD arbitraged

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zilh1> Huobi required like a 100 confirmations  then.

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Cryppto> But who? Who was that fatfinger? Could be CryptoViewers gang.

[07-Jun-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Somebody placed a huge order to buy KMD for ANY price. That is not what professionals do. It suggests a layman. Notice two prior huge volumes that did not cause any price fluctuations.

[07-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Nice idea! (re @deckersu: There is a more simple way to hold big amounts in software wallets. Just need to use multisig address with privkeys on different PCs (or other information carriers). For example in scheme 3 of 3 multisig you probably will have x3 chances to be safe. Bcz if attacker somehow will know just one of your privkeys (for example, in case of virus infection) - he will not able to spent your funds.)

[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> It didn't take long for ppl to start bashing... I guess they'd prefer to see a hacker winning big with this vulnerability... Go figure!
I wasn't affected (moved my funds as soon as I saw the warning) but I congrat the genius who had the idea of "stealing" from the thieve and move the vulnerable coins before the attacker!!!!

[telegram] <Sungonightly> It worked for me, there is the option to enter your seed in the new version. Don't worry, I had the same problem too (re @Dimension 9: It doesn‚Äôt seem to give me that option on the 0.6.0-13 version)
