[telegram] <ionstar> That may be something you will regret sometime in the future. Maybe you know about that guy who had a lot of btc, but sold because he thought it didnt go anywhere. That was before 2013. He is probably regretting that now. (re @Bobzzzzzzz: Much better projects to invest. Buy and good luck to all)

[21-May-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I was in a project once that I knew was run by the right people. While waiting for my "ship" to come in it seemed like all the other coins were taking off. So I finally sold at a loss and got into some other coins (and lost money) while the good project I was in went 5x days after I sold. 
You just can't time the markets; I find a good one and just hang out. A lot less stress too; especially while I can get 5.1% in rewards while waiting. (re @Bobzzzzzzz: Much better projects to invest. Buy and good luck to all)

[telegram] <Marina> Hello üòä

[21-May-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> So after listening to the podcast, i have a question about BarterDex and im thinking about the full life cycle of trading. I understand you will control your own keys, which is great, but what about wallet integrations into BarterDex? For example if i have a nano ledger, or some other wallet...how easy and safe will that integration be or is that not part of the project?

[21-May-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> wow...that question was just answered....haha, still leaving the comment in case others are interested in the answer they will have to watch the podcast

[telegram] <kracken> Guys is there a summary of the benefits of using komodo to protect against 51% attacks for POS projects? 
I know a pos project that really needs it. But without a dot point summary the team may dismiss it

[22-May-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> Because both BTC and KMD would have to have that attack at the same time to succeed and KMD is a Delayed proof of work...so ya (re @kracken: Guys is there a summary of the benefits of using komodo to protect against 51% attacks for POS projects?

[22-May-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> But is there perhaps a formal doc from the team that summarises the key benefits of another project using Komodo? I really want to use something like that to convince one of my favorite investments

[22-May-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <first_world_peace> Also i noticed that your reward is different utxo, so if it is less than 10 kmd no interest rate is accumulated. 
I usually claim reward and after send all kmd to myself again. This way all balance is actually being locked and rewarded ;)

[22-May-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yes you're correct. You need to have more than 10 KMD in one utxo. If you are in doubt that the kmd is getting rewards, just send the full balance to yourself to "lock" the reward generation (re @first_world_peace: Also i noticed that your reward is different utxo, so if it is less than 10 kmd no interest rate is accumulated.
