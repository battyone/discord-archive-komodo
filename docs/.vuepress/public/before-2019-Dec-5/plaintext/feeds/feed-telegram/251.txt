It was supposed to be an equity only company but a few things have happened for the good, which was a pleasant shock and as a result they will soon be announcing an  IEO. This is massive for Komodo too as we will build out large businesses on Komodo tech. Very thrilled to announce this to you.

[telegram] <mohirbas> i bought my kmd from changelly

[17-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yeah that's why. You should send the balance to yourself from a wallet like Agama, Magnum, or Guarda. (re @mohirbas: i bought my kmd from changelly)

[17-Mar-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Ledger apparently fixed the issues with nlocktime so you can use ledger live and send the balance to yourself. In theory it should begin staking within an hour if the utxo is larger than 10 KMD
