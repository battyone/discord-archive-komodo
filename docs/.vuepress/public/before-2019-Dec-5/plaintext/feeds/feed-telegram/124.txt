[telegram] <Dr> Depends how much the money you have in means to you. 
If it is money you can get back relatively quickly then keep it in.
If it isn‚Äôt, take out as much cash as you wouldn‚Äôt be pissed off if you lost it, but enough so that if KMD does 50-300x you don‚Äôt feel like you have fully wasted your chance.
Overall I have put in about 4 months of salary after tax and I am just gonna HODL no matter what. Not putting anymore in until I have cash to really spare or until I get more positive news. GL (re @Kassu2: Honest opinions please..)
