[telegram] <alexgrowler> All you need is to create a new wallet or import old one with more than 10KMD. And then in the dashboard, tap on the button "claim reward" on the Komodo tab

[17-Nov-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> What type of stress you refer to? Recently if you see grey hats have tried to over run Dpow and they have been brought to a dead end. (re @cammofunk: If Komodo blockchain is as strong as the team claims, why is there no public records of this?)

[17-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> ah thats true, I just feel like no-one even know's the kmd powerhouse. And a stresstest that shows concrete transactions per min. Would make more people aware of your platform if you showed off a little (re @Hermes08: What type of stress you refer to? Recently if you see grey hats have tried to over run Dpow and they have been brought to a dead end.)

[telegram] <Braydean> Hello here one more question

[17-Nov-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Braydean> If i hodl komodo on magnum wallet for about 100kmd how much reward can i claim per annual ?

[17-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> They said that 1million tx/sec thing back in like june didn't they? (re @Cabey: They're planning to do a 1mil/tps soon)

[17-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> and legit I could make that on flash

[17-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> wheres the blocks for proof?

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Besides the technical considerations there's no point releasing big news in this market

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> I'd like to see them on the public blockchain, is there a way?

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> I suspect it'll be timed with rebranding also

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> Shouldn't be about the money, more people will USE it (re @Cabey: Besides the technical considerations there's no point releasing big news in this market)

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> and the money will follow

[17-Nov-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> ah, good point

[17-Nov-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> I agree with that, and I hope so. Just in disbelief  that my friends havent even heard of the blockchain but they know Bitcoin cash and Lisk ect..

[17-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> I think we all wish the wider world would wake up to how great Komodo is

[17-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> But on the flip side more time to accumulate!

[17-Nov-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> Haha yes this is true :) (re @Cabey: I think we all wish the wider world would wake up to how great Komodo is)

[17-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <alexgrowler> You can claim 5.1% annually (re @Braydean: If i hodl komodo on magnum wallet for about 100kmd how much reward can i claim per annual ?)

[17-Nov-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rock> Does anyone familiar with ‚Äúfmz quant‚Äù platform? Does they support arbitrage strategy? In the bear market now, arbitrage trading it he only choice we left right? Small range of volatility, trend strategy seems not doing so good.

[telegram] <yorklab> This might help you to calculate the rewards.

[17-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> TPS is done over multiple blockchains,   You know doubters can spin up their own blockchains and launch a capacity test of their own .  Otherwise will have to wait til we do the next one,  someone may have the previous TXSCL chains saved,  but not sure.  You get 60-100 tps per chain,  need more tps just add more chains it scales linearly

$KMD #KOMODO

Zoomed out perspective in here. Touched big resistance, made rising wedge, breakdown.
Couldn't keep support around 18-18250 satoshi and now retracing downwards.

Expecting a bounce/support here on the grey zone, possibly the lower one.

[18-Nov-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <kyle9569> since bitcoin dark is now kmd. I see bitcoin dark is off coin market cap now. so what happened w all that volume bitcoin dark had when that and kmd were listed as 2 different coins.

[18-Nov-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Volume is a product of action on exchanges. Which is the trading of proxies in a database.  The volume of bitcoindark on exchange has no relation to Komodo whatsoever.  Bitcoindark has been dead for over a year now ,  chain is probably forever stuck as there are no stakers
