they sold $400 million last year alone

[25-Mar-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
likely have raised many billions

[telegram] <PTYX11> Do you know how much Komodo raised? Did you bother to look that up ? (re @TheoHx: if you want adoption)

[25-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <TheoHx> i like KMD but im not going to glorify it if its not doing well on the marketing side, for istnace their traffic flow is down 300% from their alltime high

[25-Mar-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
how much is BTC down from alltime high?

[25-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
how much is any other crypto down from all time high?

[25-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
this constant posting whenever KMD drops 2% is getting tiresome. who cares? its the standard daily volatility

[25-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and volumes go down on weekends too

[25-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Philip> Teo, a ton of projects did an awful job budgeting their funds and invested too much into marketing rather than development. It‚Äôs not working out well for them. Kmd is doing really well for itself and the development is on fire lately. The marketing will come

[25-Mar-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810

KMD doesnt go up every single day, so best to sell it and buy the magical coin that does

its only $5000+ for something that has a shelf life for a few days

[25-Mar-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It just doesn't work that way. You have to think of the yield of the investment. Spending thousands of dollars to yield a few clicks isn't going to bring any more adoption that all the tech that Komodo already puts out.

that is why we are accepting donations from people who feel strong enough for paid placements.

[25-Mar-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that is called advertising, it is expensive

[25-Mar-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and how much revenues do we get?

[25-Mar-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
$0 as we give away all the software

[25-Mar-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so spending money to get non-revenue, it is really not cost effective. that is why we havent dont it and we dont plan to do it, unless we get directed donations that direct us to buy advertising

[25-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Mhm ok that‚Äôs efficient for long run for sure, but some day kmd has to be accessible for people not aquinted with it or crypto at all

[25-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
does it?

[25-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you assume that

[25-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there are companies that use KMD, and they do the advertising

[25-Mar-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
since they would have products and services for sale, it wouldnt be insane for them to pay for advertising

[25-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Well fair point that‚Äôs possible too

[25-Mar-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is an open source project

[25-Mar-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
how much advertising do you see linux doing?

[25-Mar-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yet, how many people know about linux?

[25-Mar-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
now we are nowhere near linux stature now, but in a few decades, it isnt impossible

[25-Mar-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> Do not be stupid, instead of spending it on advertising, spend it raising and lowering the value. This is how volume is attracted to the crypto. You inflate it and when you have entered enough money you sell. It is sold slowly to agonize those who entered and thus sell lost. It repeats the process once the volume is a laugh hahaha go, is what they do all the crap cryptoland

[25-Mar-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Linux had many advantages as for example having not so many competitors so I still think it would be a good idea too make the cosmos of kmd more accessible for investors and interested firms. But its still a shame there were no donations

David you are not living in reality

The reason why it hasnt changed in recent months is that nobody has sent in any donations and we have also been living off of our hedging we did during the bull market

[25-Mar-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
we have averaged spending of 22 BTC per month, including notarization costs during the btcfee market. $5000 would be a big chunk of our monthly budget, so please stop asking us to waste it on advertising, which is totally insane before the rebranding. and even after the rebranding, it is better for the businesses that build on komodo to advertise

anyway, I believe we have proven that we know how to manage our finances and we wont be spending money on things just because it seems a popular idea to do so. It must have a positive ROI, which is not easy when we have no actual revenue source yet

[telegram] <Regnar> A question you didn't ask, are you or paid placements targeting the actual target market for Komodo usage? Most crypto sites aren't where adopters (not investors) go for information. Individual investors who buy coins on an exchange and hold, or invest in crypto don't appear to be the market. komodo is building tools for people to use to build things. CC creation to target different markets (CC development is skyrocketing) Games with NFTs and their own chains (just got a new Game team), new blockchain projects (new tools are being finished up, plus groups like Chainzilla, Chainmakers, Redfox all have clients for this too). (re @JohDio: That is not necessarily true because more investors and people involved in this business become aware of Komodo as a presence in ‚Äûon the yard‚Äú which brings more investments and adoption possibilities or partners)
