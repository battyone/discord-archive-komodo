[telegram] <aiflord777> I said show me proof of the 20k TPS

[19-Feb-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> This is their press release

[19-Feb-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> Are you serious , how old are you man

[19-Feb-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> You believe everything you read ?

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Well, if you don't believe their report, what are you doing here? (re @aiflord777: I said show me proof of the 20k TPS)

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Irrelevant (re @aiflord777: Are you serious , how old are you man)

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> So if I published a report would you just take everything I said as fact ?

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Flaux> Interesting conversation going on here but yes, no one cares about TPS as it's mostly misunderstood for now, most likely what the admin was referring to was their solution to a 51 % attack.

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Yes! That's something called trust! (re @aiflord777: You believe everything you read ?)

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> No, I don't know who you are (re @aiflord777: So if I published a report would you just take everything I said as fact ?)

[19-Feb-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> You‚Äôre so dumb (re @TonyStarkBR: Yes! That's something called trust!)

[19-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Flaux> Which is basically backing up the chains on BTC so that chains created with KMD can have BTC's security

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Komodo's devs, OTOH,  are known, not anonymous ppl

[19-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> You just said you believe everything you read on reports because you ‚Äútrust‚Äù

[19-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> That‚Äôs literally the dumbest Thing I‚Äôve heard

[19-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> That‚Äôs how you lose money and hurt people

[19-Feb-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> No one cares? It seems those guys at BCH do, or they wouldn't have forked from BTC after the scaling war of 2017... (re @Flaux: Interesting conversation going on here but yes, no one cares about TPS as it's mostly misunderstood for now, most likely what the admin was referring to was their solution to a 51 % attack.)

[telegram] <aiflord777> Crypto is so dumb

[19-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> These conversations make me cringe

[19-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I'm no admin here, my opinions are mine, and if I lose money, I'm not hurting anyone else (re @aiflord777: That‚Äôs how you lose money and hurt people)

[19-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> So, what are you doing here, smart ass? (re @aiflord777: Crypto is so dumb)

[19-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> There is no scaling war you dumbass , BCH is a money grabbing scam (re @TonyStarkBR: No one cares? It seems those guys at BCH do, or they wouldn't have forked from BTC after the scaling war of 2017...)

[19-Feb-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Flaux> TPS is simply the capacity the chain can handle in the transactions, whilst scaling is great having high TPS won't mean anything if your chain isn't being used

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Oh, sure? (re @aiflord777: There is no scaling war you dumbass , BCH is a money grabbing scam)

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Thankfully I don't have any

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Flaux> As you said everyone is attempting to scale, which directly would contradict the statement "they have solutions other chains haven't even started on"

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Flaux> Which is why it's only reasonable to point out the 51% attack solution

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> You realize nobody actually uses these things right ? Visa , PayPal and other normal payment processors will always be faster because they‚Äôre centralized (re @TonyStarkBR: So, what are you doing here, smart ass?)

[19-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> Again the point of blockchain is to prevent double spend . Period

[19-Feb-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> This is one possibility! Anyway, there are very few solutions that claim to be able to scale beyond 1k TPS (re @Flaux: Which is why it's only reasonable to point out the 51% attack solution)

[19-Feb-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I keep asking: your discourse makes you look like a crypto skeptical...
So, why do you invest in crypto? (re @aiflord777: You realize nobody actually uses these things right ? Visa , PayPal and other normal payment processors will always be faster because they‚Äôre centralized)

[19-Feb-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> Show me the TPS (re @TonyStarkBR: This is one possibility! Anyway, there are very few solutions that claim to be able to scale beyond 1k TPS)

[19-Feb-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> You go around saying that and yet literally have no idea what TPS is

[19-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> It was created for that! I didn't deny it! So? You mean it can't be improved with other functions?
ETH is in the wrong tracks, then? (re @aiflord777: Again the point of blockchain is to prevent double spend . Period)

[19-Feb-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Cross chain communication , Nothing at Stake protection ( believe this one was mainly Verus ),  scalability of hard drive space.  Mobile Dex,   Cluster scalability.  Some things I know are being worked on but don‚Äôt know if the progress, feeless transactions that don‚Äôt spam.  Secondary DPoW layers (re @aiflord777: Like what ?)

[19-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <aiflord777> I‚Äôm not saying they are false but you do realize the complexity of what you are talking about makes it impossible to debate

[19-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1) Cross-chain communication = transference of information from one blockchain to another.   2) Nothing at Stake protection - protects proof of stake blockchains from double spend attacks . 3) Hard Drive scalability- when a blockchain gets too big that it becomes encumbersome to run, how does one shrink the space but maintain the integrity of the earlier records. 4) . Cluster scalability = how to coordinate things among a multiple blockchain project.  5 ) Mobile Dex = decentralized trading on your phone 6) feeless tx that don‚Äôt spam , pretty self explanatory. 7) Secondary Notary networks = if you wanted to make your own notary system and secure your own chain how would you do that.

[19-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> It can be discarded but most likely will be archived and used as a historical reference .  Saving on HD space, requires creating a new chain , same properties of the old chain with its genesis( or a reference in the genesis block )  as the last blockhash of the old chain. The new chain imports the old chains UTXO set ( everyone has their coins from the old chain with same privkey)
