No, so why the eff are people letting this affect them.  I'm not even mad at the manipulation anymore, I'm mad at the fickle people in this space that keep falling for it.

[telegram] <siulynot> We are happy to announce that on block 200,000 COQUI Cash will do a fork to add Crypto Conditions Smart Contracts capability. This fork will add a fully functional Decentralized Token Exchange, capability to create you own token, a decentralized dice game, capability to create rewards programs and a decentralized faucet. 
Please, if you are running a COQUI full node, update your node as soon as possible to evade a fork on your node. 
The new COQUI Cash execution command looks like this: ./komodod -ac_name=COQUI -ac_supply=72000000 -ac_ccactivate=200000
Questions or suggestions are welcomed,
have a nice day everyone.
