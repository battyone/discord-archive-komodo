@CryptoMessiah4me, by your way of looking at it, if BTC drops 25% and the KMD/BTC market doesn't make an exact inverse move (second by second), then KMD drops just because BTC dropped.

I'm not sure one could make a convincing argument that more coins would result in the entire market taking an upturn; in fact, one could argue that the more coins there are is the less there is to invest in each coin, thus stuffing up all/many coins

yes, but as long as the BTC/USD rock is tied to the neck of investors, it doesn't matter if Komodo (or anything else for that matter) the greatest tech ever, the pseudo USD value sinks with the weight of the dying rock of BTC/USD (wich is also up far more than it feels like)

@areweon @ComputerGenie the KMD token isn't even the best part of Komodo.  CHIPS, DEX, and REVS are great.  Word will continue to get out.  It feels like the word is getting out slowly, but it is better than how most of the "pump projects" are created.  Many projects make an announcement that an announcement is coming that will be the biggest thing ever in crypto... but we can't tell you right now.

[20-Jun-18 08:11 PM] Crypshotta#7766
I was reading something or listening to someone say that anything what gives you interest may be classed as a security, and as we get are 5% on kmd, would it fall into that criteria?

[20-Jun-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in theory, the answer would be "no" since not all circumstances and/or amounts yield interest

[telegram] <Kaichichow> Would there be a way to make liquidity and matching easier for our dex? Say person A wants to swap from ARK to OMG. 
Instead of just putting up an order to sell ark for omg, would the system be able to bring in person B?
So if person A is wanting to swap ARK to OMG, and no current orders available. 
Person B wants to go from OMG to NEO
Person C wants NEO for ARK. 
Would a system be able to be implemented where person A B and C are automatically matched and swapped? Seeing as fees are low enough for multiple trades to reach the endgoal outcome?
