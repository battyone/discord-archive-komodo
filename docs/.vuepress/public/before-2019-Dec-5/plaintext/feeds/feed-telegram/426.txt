[telegram] <Acura360> Forwarded from tese22: everyone - The Komodo team, specially our developers and QA experts, would like to thank all participants for their commitment and support during the first atomicDEX stress-test which was primarily held to collect backend, network and DEX-protocol metrics during the extreme high load and dynamic orderbooks. 
 
This is a high-level transparency report to summarise the events, results and details of this test.
We executed the stress-test with a minimum underlying hardware infrastructure which resulted in network layer failures during the (unexpected) load peak with ~2000 (!) simultaneous traders. This gladly delivered us essential data and metrics that will now allow us to fix this by refactoring the protocol - i.e. the networking part (rebroadcasting, routing client connections and orders, etc.). Our current networking model does increase the load with the growing number of network broadcast messages and thus lead to this unpleasant experience as it resulted in a ‚Äúnetwork bottleneck‚Äù where only a limited number of trades went through. Over 100 testers have been able to successfully execute swaps during the stress-test and we want to highlight how important this stress-test in a limited environment is/was for the developers and engineers at Komodo.   Our experts will optimize the affected layer over the coming weeks and as soon as the DEX is ready for a full scale test (with multiple trading pairs and automatic spam clients) we will announce the next stress-test (with bigger prize pool) which will focus on the general trading experience as opposed to the load-test of this time.   
We will announce the winners tomorrow together with the final numbers (successful swap statistics will increase) and our team will also randomly honor testers that have not made it into the leaderboard! Thank you for your time and participation to help us perfect the DEX system.
