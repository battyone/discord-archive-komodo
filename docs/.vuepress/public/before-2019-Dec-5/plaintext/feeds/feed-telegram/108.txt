one more point about being anon. compare an anon dev that is readily accessible vs a non-anon dev that rarely if ever responds to anything. which is better?

[telegram] <Giffordde2000> This is a transcendent project and jl777c is a brilliant light beaming in our world and that alone deserves 
anonymity and as Aretha would say respect.
That fact that anyone is even responded to or even answered should be enough, time is a commodity and it is precious.
Stop with the FUD. 
Privacy is a right and we are all invested in this project and it is far bigger then many comprehend. 
Obviously many do not nor cannot understand the value, yes value of KMD. Value is a multilayered word.
This is where due diligence of research and investigation of any project is paramount. 
When that happens these fearful questions are a moot point. 
The code speaks for itself, it is the founder and it is brilliant!
No more FUD just do it and stand with Komodo and share it with everyone you meet. Personal one on one communication is very effective and stating the obvious do your own research. 
This is a transcendent project that is manifest in the crypto-verse. 
A multi dimensional entity with the capacity to expand exponentially on the inner and outer. 
As KMD does and will, it will gain strength and speed beyond your wildest dreams. 
This is a transcendent project and it is called Komodo!

I dont use by real voice as voice print analyzers are connectedto allthe microphones and there are probably almost as many of those as cameras in the surveillance states. and anybody that has the right contacts to bribe can get access to all this data.

[telegram] <M.> So basically they copied KMD and make 1 improvement ?

[18-Aug-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
actually quite a few things they added, eras for -ac parameters, verushash that so far is CPU only even after GPU miners were attempted and that is just in the first phase. we are looking forward to more advances and these will come back into KMD after some amount of time

[18-Aug-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <M.> So does VRSC help KMD or completely independent?

[18-Aug-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I work closely with miket (lead dev of VRSC https://veruscoin.io/#contributors Former Vice President and Technical Fellow at Microsoft, recognized founder and architect of Microsoft's .Net platform, ex-Technical Fellow of Microsoft's advertising platform, ex-CTO, Parallels Corporation) and we help each other out. In fact, he is one of the few that I have known in crypto that can keep up with me at the core level. If there were dozens of VRSC caliber projects in the KMD ecosystem it would be a very good thing. miket invented the timelocked block rewards and the unique coin emission for VRSC and I look foward to his innovations in the voting and identity space using KMD

[18-Aug-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just use common sense. if some large company is involved, odds are that it is monitored or has backdoors
