[23-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Oh yeah it exists and it's trading. We plan on using it for rewards, payment method, cryptoconditions, and other functions that will become available as the tech matures. (re @TonyStarkBR: The coin still exists? Do you're kind of a "token" running on Komodo's platform?)

[23-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yes basically that's a good comparison. The big difference is that we have more freedom being a Komodo Independent Chain. (re @TonyStarkBR: Like an ERC20 token on ETH (I know there are several technical differences, is just a high level comparison))

I'm also working with https://www.blockfyre.com/ What I need to know are some pros and cons that you guys have come across with the KMD project. I'll also be doing my own research obviously but it does make it easier if you guys have anything to add!

[telegram] <yorklab> The market has been doing well the last few weeks for sure. But the buying we saw the last few hours with Komodo was something different.  Almost nobody is talking about RedFox Labs, but remember, they are only in business to bring companies into the Komodo platform. Add ChainZilla to the mix and I think we'll see more buying like this in the future.
