[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> So is there any lite wallet working?

[05-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> I just arrived to my desktop and when I open agama valance is zero. I see funds were sent to  RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF adress.
Are my funds safe?
How to proceed now?

[05-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ovidiu> You can just install agama by verus if you already have agama by komodo already installed?

[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ovidiu> They are not conflicting in some way?

[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jeffja> Verus install is bugged

[05-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> Yes, I have agama by komodo installed. I should install agama by verus and problem would be solved? (re @Ovidiu: You can just install agama by verus if you already have agama by komodo already installed?)

[05-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ovidiu> Thats what i want to find out too

[05-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> I tried that but verus lite won't connect to servers and is buggy

[05-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ovidiu> I would give it a try on windows but i dont know if it conflicts in some way with the agama by komodo

[05-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jeffja> What you saying that you either install agama or agama verus and if you have both installed it is in conflict with each other and    it crashrs?

[05-Jun-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Don't think so because it is just a zip with a binary how should that conflict? But anyways... I have no other versions installed! I'll give it a try on windows

[05-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jeffja> I tried installing verus with agama already installed and i got some java script json fuck up crash.

@Ra creating a custom seed is never safe as humans are bad at generating randomness
you can use a seed generated by another secure wallet
but please don't write random words by yourself and think it is secure
