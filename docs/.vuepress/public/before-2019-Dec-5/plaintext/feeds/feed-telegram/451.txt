decentralized nature of blockchain makes cryptocurrency theoretically immune to the old ways of government control and interference. Cryptocurrencies make it easier to conduct any transactions, for transfers are simplified through use of public and private keys for security and privacy purposes. These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional financial institutions.However, the latest news on cryptocurrencies indicates that because cryptocurrencies are devoid of a central repository, a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by a computer crash, a hack, and other unexpected events.

[telegram] <Acura360> We are less than a month from releasing Komodo v0.5.0 (Obsidian Dragon), a mandatory upgrade. It includes several bugfixes, a change in the Proof of Stake algorithm for Smart Chains, and Antara Module upgrades.
The update goes live on December 20, at block 1,670,000.

[29-Nov-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Forwarded from Acura360: With the crackdown in China, the recent hack of Upbit, and the shutdown of IDAX, exchanges had a tough week. Decrypt interviewed Komodo CTO Kadan Stadelmann about the inherent risks centralized exchanges face, being attacked by malicious actors and also by authorities.
Undoubtedly, one of the overarching trends of 2020 will be the rise of decentralized exchanges, like AtomicDEX.
AtomicDEX is fully non-custodial: you control your private keys, even when you trade one asset for another. We are progressing towards 1.0 with each beta release. This week we added Feathercoin, Turkish and Hungarian translations, and fixed a bunch of connectivity bugs.

[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo doesn't pay for listings. We are already on many of the major exchanges so there isn't really any volume gain to justify paying for smaller exchanges. Also Komodo doesn't have a huge pool of money to spend on things like that, almost all the money used to pay for things are donations from developers, whales, and individual smaller investors (re @klimenko85: Is this an exchange initiative or a paid listing?)

[telegram] <Regnar> We definitely appreciate smaller exchange listings as they help us get in front of more people.

[telegram] <klimenko85> Thanks. I thought so. I just need this information for further distribution. (re @Regnar: Komodo doesn't pay for listings.
