[13-Jul-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <borntobe4live> not yet, i think. They will add many coins with own mainnets (re @icantgiveyou: Ethos released their universal wallet for all devices worldwide. Looks good so far. No KMD though)

[13-Jul-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <icantgiveyou> I got some token I couldn‚Äôt hold anywhere but MEW which I don‚Äôt like at all so I can transfer now anyways I would always keep my Komodo assets in agama it‚Äôs much simpler and safer me thinks (re @borntobe4live: not yet, i think. They will add many coins with own mainnets)

[13-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <borntobe4live> You mean, that if ETHOS supports KMD, you would still keep it in Agama? (re @icantgiveyou: I got some token I couldn‚Äôt hold anywhere but MEW which I don‚Äôt like at all so I can transfer now anyways I would always keep my Komodo assets in agama it‚Äôs much simpler and safer me thinks)

[13-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> yes, i will just use it for the odd tokens i got, remember Ethos is basically centralised and they looking to fully track all balances and movement for tax purposes (re @borntobe4live: You mean, that if ETHOS supports KMD, you would still keep it in Agama?)

[13-Jul-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <borntobe4live> Agama is better for KMD I think, also for the staking and connected coins.
A bit centralised, maybe. But you own your private keys. ETHOS is good for mainstream adoption, easy to use for many
