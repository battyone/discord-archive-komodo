[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> supply and demand moves the market. hype is the name of the game and attracts new investors to the market. the whales are certainly also trading.

[21-May-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
hype: promote or publicize (a product or idea) intensively, often exaggerating its benefits.

[21-May-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
basically people are pushing us exaggerate things, the bigger the exaggeration the better, right?

[21-May-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
for that maybe a different project that is all vapor and no substance is better as they can make whatever amazing claims without having to prove it

[21-May-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> I agree with you 100% !! That's why I said several times that people must have patience! In addition, you as the main dev not without reason for a KMD OTC trade in the amount of 50 - 100 BTC asked if you yourself would not be convinced of komodo (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> for that maybe a different project that is all vapor and no substance is better as they can make whatever amazing claims without having to prove it)

[telegram] <Lennart> dpow protected chains are effectively protected by the massive Bitcoin hashrate. that's a huge advantage isnt it?

[21-May-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> as for disadvantage.. i dont know, takes some steps to setup maybe.. it costs some kmd..

[21-May-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> What is the cost? (re @Lennart: as for disadvantage.. i dont know, takes some steps to setup maybe.. it costs some kmd..)

[telegram] <kracken> Absolutely 100% (re @Lennart: dpow protected chains are effectively protected by the massive Bitcoin hashrate. that's a huge advantage isnt it?)

[21-May-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> as for cost i think it's best to talk to the team directly as there are different levels of dpow AFAIK

[21-May-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> around 300 KMD

[21-May-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> I wonder how much that is in usd and btc terms. I haven't been following the price

[21-May-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> all i know is that if you'd bought around 7000 KMD the rewards alone will pay for dPoW..

[21-May-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> KMD is about $1.15 USD

[21-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> So it would cost around... well less than usd$400 to use dpow..?

[21-May-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> Per year?

[21-May-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Yes, that is my understanding

[21-May-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Alternatively buy 7,000 KMD and claim the 5.1% annual rewards to cover the yearly costs

[21-May-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Price is low at the moment, might be worth paying more upfront.

[21-May-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <TheoHx> based on the weekly and daily chart, we are at the highest possible bottom (KMD/BTC) - 100% retracement as seen on 11/26/2019 where the reversal happened. Ideally we would like to see this week and the next to be green for confirmation. stay positive my friends

[21-May-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> your message is a little confusing..but i think i get your question: From a high level you can say the same thing about every other product and service we buy/use today, competition exists for a reason. Xbox vs Playstation vs Nintendo vs Steam as an example. Or better yet the dozens of different business applications out there fitting unique business needs. It all comes down to preference and personal use case. Blockchain is not going away and there is enough room in the ecosystem for all strong projects to flourish. (re @Ivan.V: Can Blockchain Scale? With #ETH, #BTC, #XRP, #LTC? #Amazon made the choice #KMD #Komodo and #ICX #icon are the platform for them to build that is what they choose now you? What do you think? What will you choose?)
