[29-Apr-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <IntenseBike52> they dont need an exchange though. they should focus more on development than the market side of things (re @pattersonbrad: Right now komodo have many exchanges but adding one will give us more options since I'm really not into on the exchanges that they have.)

[telegram] <IntenseBike52> The marketing for Komodo isn‚Äôt as strong as it is with other cryptocurrencies. But Komodo could gain more traction and adoption in the market if it did a better job on its product development. Markets should follow up soon (re @pattersonbrad: What do you think kmd lack in?)

[29-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Pretty cool of them. Notary Nodes are encouraged to help upcoming projects with funding and resources in order to help Komodo grow. There are plenty of excellent candidates this yea. It appears Chainstrike will be providing funds to Komodoregames and Barterlly.

[telegram] <Regnar> Remember to read notary node proposals and see the things they are doing to help the community, they could be doing conferences to raise awareness, building wallets or exchanges, bringing projects to Komodo, selling dPoW services to others, or funding community projects. This is in no way an endorsement of any particular project! But definitely read proposals and make your vote count. The better the ecosystem, the more value it brings to Komodo and KMD

[telegram] <Ra> This has been one of kmds problem since it inception (years now) and I don't think that would change maybe it not marketing , maybe most people don't find any uses for it , more technical people yes sure, so I don't think it a marketing issue (re @IntenseBike52: The marketing for Komodo isn‚Äôt as strong as it is with other cryptocurrencies. But Komodo could gain more traction and adoption in the market if it did a better job on its product development. Markets should follow up soon)

[29-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Users just ain't flocking not to say it good or bad, but maybe it time to accept it not marketing that at fault but general users don't understand topics such as CC or other technical subject

[29-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
MGW tech was many years ahead of its time, now many proxy DEX use similar tech without multisig

[29-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> and dont care unless they have a UI in which they can interact with such maybe DEX, poker etc

[29-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is almost 3 years old and people finally seeing its value

[29-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be the tech is indeed years ahead of its time

[29-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and certainly end users need gui, otherwise they dont care

[29-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what companies like redfox will be doing to productize the tech

[29-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
inventing half a dozen ground breaking tech, i know users dont care but the people that build products for users do

[29-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the alternative is nearly centralized things like EOS

[29-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
which isnt really any step foward

[29-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes however they have money in life money talks now imagine that capital in kmd hands

[29-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> but in the end users will always choose a product that serves them best so yes it will take time , but as for a DEX its needed Now to be honest, it a billion dollar problem and binance is not solving it so market for a great limitless Dex is still open. So still opportunity to get that market which will translate to more capital generated and put to work for marketing, UIs, hiring ,investing etc building a thriving community

[29-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
well we do have a pretty good ui for mobile dex, so not sure what your point is

[29-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo built all this after raising only $2 mil in its ICO and most of that is reserved for notarization costs

[29-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we simply dont have funding to be making many different end user guis and marketing all of them.

[29-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
our approach is to market the tech and have others make and market the solutions

[29-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
though for DEX it is quite critical so we did that one ourselves

[29-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Don't think I was disagreeing with your point if you read what I wrote above, Dex can produce needed capital to invest back into the ecosystem, the marketing era is dead , maybe in the mid to late 2017 yes marketing would have yielded  result now it just noise only product is the user generator in this new era.  we are on the same ship kmd problem is not enough users which can change (re @Ra: but in the end users will always choose a product that serves them best so yes it will take time , but as for a DEX its needed Now to be honest, it a billion dollar problem and binance is not solving it so market for a great limitless Dex is still open.

[29-Apr-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Notary nodes mine KMD and relay information from the Komodo ecosystem to Bitcoin. (re @Debodebeli: Hi
Can somebody simle answer  me what is the benefit of node owners from voting?)

[29-Apr-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Its equihash so there's quite a few ASICs available depending on your location and electricity cost. You could also consider mining ARRR which I think is fairly profitable for a lot of Equihash miners (re @tim87: im looking to mine Komodo, whats the best rig to buy? and software)

[29-Apr-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <freerider101> To perform an atomic swap, both assets are locked up in a 2-of-2 multisig address (with a timeout that allows the original owner to reclaim it). At least one of the two networks has to support Schnorr signatures (preferably both).
