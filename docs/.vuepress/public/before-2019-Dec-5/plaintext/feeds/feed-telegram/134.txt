[17-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> I've just got one question this 5% stake reward per month isn't going to last long is it. 60% inflation per annum doesn't seem wise but I could be wrong I have not read any white papers as of yet in regards to it.

[17-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Remember that the 5.1% reward is being done on a yearly basis and you have to claim the reward each month in order to be able to generate 5.1% of rewards :) (re @pumba2988: Hello fellow Komodians)

[17-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@pumba2988 the 5.1% is Annual - APR ( Annual Percentage Rate) , so you have to divide 5.1% by 12 , which should get you about 0.425 % a month

[17-Sep-18 11:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I think one of the upside of cryptocurrency is the increase of Financial Education for public  (hopefully) üòÑ

[17-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> According to the post posted before it pretty much says it used to be 12 months to accrue 5% now you accrue it in only one month. After one month that wallet no longer earns a stake. Unless you send that balance to another KMD wallet and once sent there it will start again. Essentially you can do 5% every month just gotta transfer funds from old wallet to new wallet every month?? Or am I seeing it differently (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <Gordon Komodo> @pumba2988 the 5.1% is Annual - APR ( Annual Percentage Rate) , so you have to divide 5.1% by 12 , which should get you about 0.425 % a month)

[telegram] <Andreeees> How often do i have to claim rewards in agama?

[18-Sep-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> This one (re @Hermes08: Here is an article from our knowledgeable that has more information about the structure of the kmd rewards system. https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/20480015/How+to+claim+the+KMD+active+user+Reward+in+Agama)

[18-Sep-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andreeees> Once a month? What if i do it only once a year?

[18-Sep-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You have to do it once a month , this is obligatory since there has been a change with the network rules.

[18-Sep-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> But you can do it daily if you want too right?

[18-Sep-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> 0.425% per month on holdings seems legit. But since the network rules have changed its too my understanding that if you don't collect reward after 30 days you won't accrue anymore staking rewards.

[18-Sep-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> Still better than holding money in a bank account

[18-Sep-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can do it daily also as long as you have more than .01 to claim you are good.

[18-Sep-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andreeees> So if i miss it just one time, i won‚Äôt be able to claim it anytime in future?

[telegram] <big7989> Î∞òÍ∞ëÏäµÎãàÎã§

[18-Sep-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> that's not the case because you have next day or month to do it

[18-Sep-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> After KMD block 1 Million, the amount of time before the rewards stop accruing is 1 month. But the annual reward becomes 5.1% instead of the previous 5%.

[18-Sep-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> so you have a 1 month time period to be on track with 5.1 % per year

[18-Sep-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> as long as you fulfill this you should be around that percentage

[18-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> if you pass a month and you remembered after two weeks past the month date when you needed to claim the rewards the only thing is that you won‚Äôt claim the full 5.1% annually but maybe let's say 4.78 % annually so it just depends on the users how much they are engaged with the wallet but as long as you claim monthly it will all be good

[18-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Sep-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryptocries> I have a question. If I join KMD today and hold KMD in agama  which is 18th Sept, should I claim my rewards at the end of Sept or 18th of October, next month ? (re @Hermes08: Also thanks for your feedback I will try to explain it better in the guide)

[18-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> 18 of October will count as the first month

[18-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> Are the Agama wallets the only wallets that receive this staking reward? Is there only agama wallets available to the public? Ledger nano must store our KMD in similar staking wallets since I suspect they are reaping the rewards from their users.

only UTXO of 10KMD or greater will generate reward so if you claim when only .01 reward , you might end up with a .01 UTXO which will not generate reward after you claim

[18-Sep-18 03:57 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
currently it's more profitable to claim monthly
