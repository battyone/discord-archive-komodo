[telegram] <PTYTrader> It isn't guaranteed it will be added. Usually there is a minimal vetting process. Also some coins aren't compatible for atomic swaps

[14-Jun-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It all depends on what kind of coin you have or Eth token

[14-Jun-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Airp2p> Its a eth token, are they compatible?

[14-Jun-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Airp2p> I can also have one of our coders look at it more closely, just reading a bit up on atomic swaps and how it works, brilliant

[telegram] <cryptoginto> You have to have the name trademarked to have any legal claim for that (re @rr621801: omg someone is selling komodocoin domain for $50,000 is that legal??)

if nothing happens restart the wallet

[14-Jun-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Guido> Restarted the wallet, now it saying synchronization in progress, so I will wait.. Thanks!

[14-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You could migrate your coin to a komodo chain and not have to worry about gas prices, scaling issues, privacy, atomic swap integration, etc. :) (re @Airp2p: I can also have one of our coders look at it more closely, just reading a bit up on atomic swaps and how it works, brilliant)

[14-Jun-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yes it's fine for a regular user (re @Guido: Or is keeping in the lite wallet just fine for a regular user?)

[14-Jun-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Jun-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Native gives access to privacy features and rpc commands and Jumblr and some other benefits but if you just want to send and receive coins and collect interest lite mode is fine. (re @Guido: Or is keeping in the lite wallet just fine for a regular user?)

[14-Jun-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
