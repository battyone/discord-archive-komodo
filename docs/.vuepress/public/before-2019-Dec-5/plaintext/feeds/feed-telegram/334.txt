[telegram] <mozsi> Your real concern should be dev competence (re @Heretic: I dont talk if it is good or bad...I am talking about that it is possible to take all my money)

[05-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> This is not the first and not the last time something similar happens. Keyloggers, clipboard sniffers, etc. Theoretically any wallet, especially Nodejs wallet with external dependencies can be exploited exactly the same manner. We could and should have done a better job with auditing external packages, and we take responsibility 100%. This is not about “OMG Komodo can access anyone’s funds wtf”. That is not the case and has never been the case. (re @xarux: quite rightly said!)

[05-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> I think that the immediate and proactive action from the team shows their competence. (re @mozsi: Your real concern should be dev competence)

[05-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> But my wallet was created in 2017. Why my funds were moved? (re @torsten1: Important question, thanks for asking. As you can read in the announcement we used the same vulnerability the hacker planned to use. This vulnerability only affected a subset of specific wallets created by / imported to Agama in the last 4 months. It’s an Agama vulnerability, not a “Komodo hack”)

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> If you used that wallet in the recent months it was compromised (re @Pablo_cbs: But my wallet was created in 2017. Why my funds were moved?)

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> Ok.. i use it every month at least (re @polycryptoblog: If you used that wallet in the recent months it was compromised)

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> If your funds were moved fill out the form above (re @Pablo_cbs: Ok.. i use it every month at least)

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> Already did it. Thanks (re @polycryptoblog: If your funds were moved fill out the form above)

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> Jason, i have to download agama v0.5.6a-beta right? This is agama verus.

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yes, create a new address there and send your funds to the new address, do not type in new seed to the Komodo Agama

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ethanwilliamg> How much KMD was stolen?

[05-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> Thanks (re @polycryptoblog: Yes, create a new address there and send your funds to the new address, do not type in new seed to the Komodo Agama)

[05-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Still being determined,  we estimate we have saved 90% before attacker could reach them, and are putting together a plan for those who lost funds and to reclaim funds that we have saved (re @ethanwilliamg: How much KMD was stolen?)

[05-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Can you give some info regarding DP situation? I was unfortunate enough to decide on sending all my kmd's there. As well as pirates. (re @polycryptoblog: Still being determined,  we estimate we have saved 90% before attacker could reach them, and are putting together a plan for those who lost funds and to reclaim funds that we have saved)

[05-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> I do not have any info on DP heard they stopped KMD for now, don’t know about pirate

[05-Jun-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
I am working on a plan to restore 80% of funds, even for addresses that were wiped out. not sure this can be achieved until we get more details on the actual damage done

[05-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Ok. I understood they were hacked too (only kmd) and pirates were safe. Guess just have to wait (re @polycryptoblog: I do not have any info on DP heard they stopped KMD for now, don’t know about pirate)

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <breasal_mnl> So my Supernet asset was not swiped from Agama - should it still be moved?

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Assetchains should be moved as well if you used that seed in the past 4-6 months

[05-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <breasal_mnl> Hmm. Ok thanks Jason. Should be safe but I’ll move to be safe.

[05-Jun-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <breasal_mnl> Btw any info I can read about where supernet is in the kmd ecosystem ?

[05-Jun-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <breasal_mnl> Not kept up with development lately

[05-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Make sure to generate new seed NOT USING Komodo Agama,  Verus Agama is fine.  Supernet is an umbrella of all the different techs built in the ecosystem.  In regards to that, Dex is coming along well, cc modules being built

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> we all understand it! But we need to store komodo somewhere in the future! It turns out that at the moment the safest paper wallet??????? (re @torsten1: This is not the first and not the last time something similar happens.
