[telegram] <encryptedBone> can SEC   shut down  hyperdex / barterdex ?

[24-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Barterdex is open source and peer to peer so this means that the technology will always be available ...the purpose of Barterdex is to enable atomic transactions...that's it's main purpose. It's decentralized because you hold the private keys of the smart address that you are using. This is they key of the dex...and with this in mind you could see some Dex implementing Barterdex technology with KYC and that still is decentralized because at the end you are in full control of your private keys.

[24-Nov-18 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> By it being open sourced the code will always be available to be used and modded in different iterations of the same protocol.
