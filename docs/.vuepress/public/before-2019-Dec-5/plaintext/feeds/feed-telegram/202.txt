[telegram] <yorklab> But not if you hold on exchanges, must be in your own wallet.

[02-Feb-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You don't need your wallet open.  Just open it once a month to claim reward.

[telegram] <Atlas> good review )

[03-Feb-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> but not undestand at now how tx/sec  have KMD ?

[03-Feb-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> like visa ?  22k ?

[03-Feb-19 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> KMD tx is technically infinite but blocktime is around 1 min. (re @Atlas: like visa ?  22k ?)

[03-Feb-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> ok block time 1 min ) how tx include max in 1 block  now

[03-Feb-19 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> answer get ~ tx

[03-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> i see on 2018 kmd tested 20 and 40k tx in sec

[03-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> but its test not now how i think

[03-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> so if kmd apply in real live its make big pump

[03-Feb-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> 20 - 50 usd for kmd

[03-Feb-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> It is because we use multiple chains (re @Atlas: ok block time 1 min ) how tx include max in 1 block  now)

[03-Feb-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> a when u send kmd from desktop wallet to desktop wallet   how long waite what coin is resive ?

[03-Feb-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> on some other coins its time 5-10 sec

[03-Feb-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> and after confirmaition  5 - 30 min

[03-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> in future yes, the sapling upgrade is a first step in that direction but then further changes are necessary (re @kapscedric: hello do you know if in the future z transaction are able to works in lite mode or in electrum wallet with no need of download all blockchain)

[03-Feb-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> seeing the tx is in seconds like any other coin, confirmation is ~1 minute and dpow definitive confirmations ~10 minutes (re @Atlas: a when u send kmd from desktop wallet to desktop wallet   how long waite what coin is resive ?)

[03-Feb-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> no no not confirmaition time  ok 1 min its wery fast

[03-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> but info what you have in coins before confirmaition

[03-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> i send you now kmd /// u resive message  instantly ?

[03-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> what coins starts confirmaition ///

[03-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> you see the tx in your wallet almost instantly, but without confirmations. This is true for any coin, even Bitcoin

[03-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> ok .... sorry not know that ) (re @barbierir: you see the tx in your wallet almost instantly, but without confirmations. This is true for any coin, even Bitcoin)

[03-Feb-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> No, you first need 1 confirmation. So it will take around 1 minute. Unless you trust the network and consider a tx valid as soon it is in the mempool (but this is dangerous). (re @Atlas: i send you now kmd /// u resive message  instantly ?)

[03-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> hm )  so who rigth )

[03-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> We are saying both the same thing. (re @Atlas: hm )  so who rigth ))

[03-Feb-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> no no 1 min and instantly its not to same )

[03-Feb-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> Komodo has a channel CC in development, that once fully implemented will allow tx that are instantly confirmed via prepaid channels

[03-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> i think i need install wallet and test it ))

[03-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> .... There is a lot of ressource about how blockchain work on Binance YouTube channel. You should take a look. (re @Atlas: no no 1 min and instantly its not to same ))

[03-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> try Bitcoin QT first, if you never tried a cryptocurrency before. Start from the basic

[03-Feb-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> i know  i tested that in KRB coin

[03-Feb-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> its work instantly on KRB

[03-Feb-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> Bitcoin QT so big )

[03-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> yes but worth the lesson

[03-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> and understand the utxo and change-address stuff if you use full mode

[03-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> I doubt it, KRB blocktime is around 240s.
There is a big difference between instant non confirmed transactions and transaction with at least 1 confirmation. (re @Atlas: its work instantly on KRB)

[03-Feb-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> for users wery important see what coins is income

[03-Feb-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> its not matter confirmed or not

[03-Feb-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> It is, to prevent double spend. (re @Atlas: its not matter confirmed or not)

[03-Feb-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> yes its important problem

[03-Feb-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> but i need only recive message for income tx

[03-Feb-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> before 1 confirm in all blockchaines you cant spend coins

[03-Feb-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kliop41> Then consider that literally all blockchain project transactions are instant 😂

[03-Feb-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> Yes but does this allow for a fully customisable inflation model or are we stuck with the option of either a reducing block reward or 100% produced up front supply? (re @Acura360: https://twitter.com/0xca333/status/1092044806048616449)

[03-Feb-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> There are many ways to set up a chain.  Yes you should be able to fully customize inflation.  I’m not sure if it was in the last big update or if it will be in the next one at election time.  But miket of Verus created epochs, which combined with existing features should give you what you need

[03-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> Ive been told that many times

[03-Feb-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> Im waiting. Ive practice launched a few assets and yeah.. the second i can make a doi based inflation pos asset on kmd, i will

[03-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> I need either a dev to make the required function.. or, the apparent update to make it possible

[03-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> It needs to be a default option to have a simple sigmoid function

[03-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CalemJohnSmith> Pick year end date and total amount and thats basicly it

[03-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
