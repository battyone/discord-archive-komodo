[telegram] <serge> If I mine arrr, will the arrr that I  mine have any attachment to me/my miner? Or will the new coins I mine be 100% anonymous

[03-Jul-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the mining pool could correlate how many ARRR your zaddr received, but if you just consolidate from your mining zaddr to a hodl zaddr, then all links are broken. even if the mining pool is coerced to reveal all outbound transactions, you remain private. also, each time a node is restarted, all the operationstatus is cleared, also z_getoperationresult will clear all send info. however, most pools/exchanges will (should) be logging these for troubleshooting and maybe they are not diligently deleting them

[03-Jul-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so to be 100% private, just transfer from your mining zaddr to any other zaddr

[03-Jul-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
then even with the extreme assumption that all exchanges and pools you use are attacker nodes, you are still private

[telegram] <yorklab> With regulation clamping down world wide the privacy coins will have a tough time getting/staying listed on exchanges. This is why Komodo no longer has the privacy feature; they are trying to stay compliant so they can continue to stay on, and possibly get added to exchanges. For privacy you can use Pirate (ARRR).
