[17-Nov-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> I mean I have no real data to prove my point. But just taking into account a few thins. For example, KMD has been looking good on many charts for months but still going down. And that everywhere I mention KMD people say it is undervalued, are they them selves invested or not. And the fact that KMD has brought us a functioning top of the game technology on the area cryptos originally aimed to provide, meaning easy to use, fungible and private way to share value. And the fact that now we may really have started the bull, I think rank35 by the end of the year can be a piece of cake.

On November 11, Chuangshi Capital announced that it will complete the multi-million yuan increase in Komodo (KMD) at the second level to support its ecological construction and development. Komodo is a privacy and cross-chain-centric cryptocurrency. The founder is JL777, the top developer of cryptocurrency. It proposes a new delayed workload proofing consensus mechanism. It can be published using the Bitcoin blockchain through the Equihash-based PoW protocol. Notarization improves security while using zero-knowledge proof to provide 100% anonymous transactions. Cross-chain, through Komodo's joint multi-chain technology, all sub-chains are granted seamless cross-chain operation with the federal chain. Each sub-chain can also connect and collaborate with the broader blockchain industry by connecting non-federal chains through atomic exchange. It combines the anonymity of ZCash with the security of Bitcoin, while featuring innovative atomic cross-chain technology.

the base nodes are enough to launch your Smart Chain and be ready to grow the network
but they might not be able to tolerate the load of a lot of new nodes connecting to them at the same time
so, if you are expecting a sudden influx of new nodes (as it happens during a Public launch), adding additional nodes (2 to 3) is a good idea
once other nodes are started and become part of the network, the load on the nodes maintained by the Antara Composer should decrease significantly

in spite of many exchanges closed, the fully arbitraged price appears to be right around $1

[18-Nov-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
there is plenty of KMD on binance that could be sold, over 10 million, so for those expecting a giant correction when wallets are reenabled, i wouldnt be so sure about that. it could be a 5% correction from looking at the different exchange prices

[18-Nov-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the china effect is quite significant and with volumes still relatively low (on binance), it isnt anywhere close to a pump level. my guess is that strong accumulation is going on as only the early adopters from the chinese community is likely to have come onboard to date.
