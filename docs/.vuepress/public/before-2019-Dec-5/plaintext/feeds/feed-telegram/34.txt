[telegram] <icantgiveyou> i think we talking about cult as an iconic status here not religion (re @ch6ris: There is no distinction between cults and religion. They also believe in Gods that do not exist.)

[25-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoMessiah4me> it was not possible to know human history without knowing the Catholic Church's struggle with gnostic Christianity. The church, like many pagan practices, had the same life in the life of Apolloius, the most important healer and sorceress of the first century.

Thank you for checking our whitepaper
1) rules and regulations per country is subject to its licenses, such as in our country we need to have an EMI (electronic money issuer)  and VC (virtual currency license yes there is one by article 944 and 942 circular memo ) license issued by BSP (banko Sentral or central bank) we have already applied, and in cases with other countries (such as HK they recuqire an MSO or money service operator license we have applied as well Singapore too) we have partnered with remittance agencies in those countries, and in our roadmap the different time line is because of the difficulty in obtaining them/partnering with real established businesses not just crypto to crypto partnership (for obvious reasons we can’t disclose them) 
We understand that majority of ICOs have underperformed even straight up scam that’s why We have opened a limited private sale with money back guarantee to show we have the confidence that we are here to put up serious legitimate business operation solving a problem (the unbanked) not just doing an ICO for ICOs sake. Hence the team have vested our tokens for more than 3 years which is longest in the industry by a landslide to show that too. And yes the requirements are quite stringent because it’s real even though it might sound misleading, as real business is concerned. 
For the ICO and dico it’s just a typo on our part. 
And yes we believe the entire crypto market will rise that’s why we’re all here in the first place right? (re @HMod_STULLE: atleast you can always get your money back 🤷🏻‍♂️)
