[telegram] <Raghav> I need to know this as well (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: Once Binance bans USA where can I trade KMD? Also Bittrex is banned here)

[26-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Raghav> Maybe it doesn’t get banned

[26-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <RAHUL> Not hoping from kmd this type of dump

[26-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RAHUL> If btc will go upto 20k then kmd 3k or 4k or 5k....😭😭😭

[26-Jun-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Nobody knows what coins will trade on U.S. Binance. But it will definitely be a lot fewer coins than on the regular binance.

[26-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Taner> 😭😭😭😭😭 (re @RAHUL: If btc will go upto 20k then kmd 3k or 4k or 5k....😭😭😭)

[26-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Do not worry. It will be around 1,30 usd if even btc goes to 20k. Then it will be our turn. (re @RAHUL: If btc will go upto 20k then kmd 3k or 4k or 5k....😭😭😭)

[26-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RAHUL> Thereafter btc will dump badly (re @Ggokhangark: Do not worry. It will be around 1,30 usd if even btc goes to 20k. Then it will be our turn.)

[26-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RAHUL> Now Btc is bubbling.

[26-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RAHUL> Because fund will move into alts  then BTC absolutely dump .

[26-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> If btc dumps then alts will dump even harder

[26-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> That's always been the case

[26-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> However you will be better than now. (re @RAHUL: Thereafter btc will dump badly)

[26-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> People still treating btc as if this were some dead cat bounce

[26-Jun-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RAHUL> Not will dump because whales will earn from alts. (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: If btc dumps then alts will dump even harder)

[26-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Check out a btc volatility study. When btc stops being volatile then alts generally rise.

[26-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Right now its volatility is flying

[26-Jun-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Check 2017 btc bull run and see what happened to alts after btc made dump. (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: If btc dumps then alts will dump even harder)

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Do not worry. It will do same. But the question is from which price btc will do down? This one I do not guess now. Maybe 20k. Maybe 16k. Or 50-60k.

[26-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kapscedric> i m annoyed if i have sell at 19000 i can have 2x more kmd to buy back  but it s life it s happen so quickly i hope for the futur of kmd don t sell

[26-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> This is normal. Bottom is there. It can go to even 0,00006 sats in these conditions. (re @zahaliya: This is not a normal decline, it has fallen too much, and other altcoins are not so much.)

[26-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Couple of points about the price:
-Maybe it's possible that the frozen deposits/withdrawals in some exchanges accelerated the decline now that btc is climbing
-Understand that btc is gone crazy and KMD is pretty much at all time low in satoshis while there are huge news and rebranding coming and we are at least 2-3x below "normal level"
-Logically this would mean excellent moment to buy and dca
-If you believe in kmd's tech and vision, remember we are funded for at least 9  or so years and you are colletting that sweet 5,1% anyways
-Dollar-wise we are not losing much so it'll be really interesting to see how high we will bounce once btc corrects, rebranding, antara etc are done. Hopefully also some trick like that 1 million tps for the public🤔😅

[26-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I don't believe there arrr many in this group that believe this is a fair price for kmd. In other words it's cheap now.

[26-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rick> Hopefully btc dont dumps

[26-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Actually now thinking about it.. This 1 million tps demo could serve as a really good marketing trick in the current market situation. Just to get some attention, this would be recognized widely and would also increase the interest towards other komodo features and rebranding. And when asked why this was done just give them answer: "Because we can". 😅

[26-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Werxadler> The good thing is there is no real reason for this dump, still komodo is great tech and awesome news are ahead of us, i expect an even greater pump at some point, not sure when though
