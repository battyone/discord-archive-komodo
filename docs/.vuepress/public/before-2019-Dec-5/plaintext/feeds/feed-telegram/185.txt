[03-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> the coins are just in the new address but i have no way to access them... as the wallet doesn't show this address

[03-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> i give that a try if this doesnt work (re @RealesState: maybe you can try this version too, https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases)

[03-Dec-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Or you can use lite mode where it sends all funds to the same addrerss when you claim rewards.

[03-Dec-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> still the same... i dont see the new address in the wallet even after a rescan

That means you collected `5.11998781 KMD` reward just 2 weeks before that using the same address.

[03-Dec-18 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
based on the tx history of that address

[03-Dec-18 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
did the rescan finish?

[03-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> yes i did collect the 55 kmd.. and that was the last transaction so i not been hacked

[03-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> yes i finished the rescan and still looks the same

[03-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> can not see address: RRN2a8QxC1GcKjd4SGKbLNo56pZKqdXc4N

[03-Dec-18 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
then, stop the wallet and start with `reindex` option (this will take longer time)

[03-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> the new address should be linked to my seed key

Search on Google Play Store "Agama wallet techloverhd"

[03-Dec-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> i thought the seed key hold everything

[03-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> because what happened was my pc i had to format my pc and i always just use the seed key to log into the agama wallet

[03-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> using native mode

[03-Dec-18 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
Seed holds a specific address. In Native mode all addresses and their private keys are stored in wallet.dat file

[03-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> oh fuck then.. i lost it then if thats the case

[03-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> and i have already formatted my pc so i will not be bale to recover the wallet.dat file

[03-Dec-18 02:31 PM] SHossain#0007
you can't use seed key to login into Native mode. you can only import seed key into native mode

[03-Dec-18 02:32 PM] SHossain#0007
you can try HDD data recovery if you can find that wallet.dat file. but, there is no other way to retrieve if you didn't backup wallet.dat or the private key of `RRN2a8QxC1GcKjd4SGKbLNo56pZKqdXc4N`

[03-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> yes, i imported my seed key into native mode.. when i created my seed key the address was: RXZZ4m1wCn1CMk9EdWdZvwh58U7bg5VoGs

[03-Dec-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> now i have a new address: RRN2a8QxC1GcKjd4SGKbLNo56pZKqdXc4N

[03-Dec-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> so what your saying is the seed key does not link to the new address

[03-Dec-18 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007
when you use native mode to send funds or claim reward, the funds goes to a new change address which is different from the address that the seed phrase generates. that is default behaviour for any coin that uses native mode including BTC
if you use the seed in Lite mode, all funds stays in same address

[03-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> i lost it all then

[03-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <andju> no way for me to get back

[03-Dec-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> These could be some options you may want to consider if you're unable to access the orginal wallet.dat file.

[03-Dec-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
