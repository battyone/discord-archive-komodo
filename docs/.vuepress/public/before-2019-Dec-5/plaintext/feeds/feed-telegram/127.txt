[telegram] <yorklab> You can claim daily, and though the fees are very small it can add up over time. That link I gave you will give you a pretty good idea.

[08-Sep-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <blade4383> Yup understood ... thanks a ton ! Earlier I waited for the interest to get above 10

[08-Sep-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <blade4383> Now will claim it as often as I can

[08-Sep-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I claim it whenever I think about it. Sometimes it's every three weeks, sometimes every three or four days.
