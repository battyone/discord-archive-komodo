MSHARK is designed for holding long term. It is backed by a set of investment assets actively managed by the Komodo team. The value of the MSHARK asset chain is determined by calculating the value of each of the cryptocurrency assets in the MSHARK fund.
We have automated the process of tracking the overall value of the cryptocurrency assets held in the MSHARK fund. Users who are familiar with the UNIX command line can discover the current market value of an MSHARK unit by entering commands within an installation of BarterDEX. Please ask for more instructions on our Slack channel if this interests you. The Komodo team also has ‚Äúmarket maker‚Äù bots trading on BarterDEX that are programmed to trade around the value of MSHARK‚Äôs total assets.

[07-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Krryypton#5637
Is this calculation correct? Let's say that the envisaged daily trading volume on AtomicDEX reaches $1 million. That is $365 million annual volume. The transaction fee collected by AtomicDEX is 0.15% of traded volume. That is annual fees of 365,000,000 * 0,0015 = $547,500. Half of it goes to DEX, i.e.  $273,750. There are 1 million DEX coins, meaning the annual income per 1 DEX coin is 273,750/1,000,000 = $0,27375. Is this correct, Komodo Team?

[telegram] <Hastrup> Here is all the fees that have been collected (re @Cryptick1: Hello, I am new here. I hear you have an atomic dex. I am intrigued. Can someone share a link for the explorer. I want to take a look at the transactions and see for myself what is going on?)

What defect are you talking about, @CryptoBridge? 
Are you cancelling orders for everyone because of the culprits? 
How is your investigation going?
Are you sure you want to lose your #trust?
