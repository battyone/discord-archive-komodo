[16-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Shivsempire> Yes but if there are enterprise level dapps built on Komodo platform then will POW be able to support those apps as there are newer consensus models such as POA and DPOS? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> KMD changing to PoS wont reduce bitcoin's PoW power consumption at all. Since BTC is already using this power, why not recycle it?)

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what does the consensus model have to do with dapps?

[16-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Shivsempire> Better scalability as POA and DPOS have high potential for Scalability for Dapps (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> what does the consensus model have to do with dapps?)

[16-Aug-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
DPOS is getting very close to centralized and the delegates have too much power as they create all blocks

[16-Aug-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD uses dPoW and is fine for scalability

[16-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Shivsempire> Hmm that sounds great ...so only smart contracts features not yet available yet on Komodo ? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> KMD uses dPoW and is fine for scalability)

[16-Aug-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it is available for any chain with -ac_cc=1+, so other chains can get the initial contracts: tokens, faucet, rewards and dice, with more coming

[16-Aug-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the  plan is to get them fully field tested before activating it in KMD

[16-Aug-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using blockchain enforced dice and the other contracts in #cc-general and making good progress. we only started onthe utxo contracts several weeks ago,so with relatively small effort we get new contract functionality across the ecosystem

[telegram] <Hermes08> Even though you encrypt your seed is always recommended to keep your seed written down or copied in a cold storage at least as backup. The encryption is saved locally in your PC so you are dependent on the PC to have that file to decrypt it.
