currently it is via command line, there is a webgui version running on localhost (native komodod -ac_name=ROGUE), ultimately after we get mobile CC tx signing working, then web based would be possible

[telegram] <Seko> JL777 estimates that there will be about 200 million KMD, although the exact sum could be lower or slightly higher. The exact amount will depend on the percentage of KMD in private z addresses over the 13.5 years, as these will not earn interest.

it is totally up to what percentage is doing the monthly claiming.

[18-Feb-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
using coinsupply rpc call we can track monthly growth in coin supply and see how that compares to maximum levels. the 200 million requires close to maximum rewards every month for 13 years
