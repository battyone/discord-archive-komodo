[telegram] <n> why not..if you don't think it will then say it lol

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n> i'm not asking so someone can tell me it will hit 100$

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n> i'm curiously asking what you guys think

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> Have you seen the current trends and changes?

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> For the entire market or KMD specifically?

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <wukenobi> great stuff!!! Good work! 👍🏻 (re @Acura360: https://youtu.be/qy7Ne4S-g9Q)

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Yes it is possible and depending on what is achieved a realistic goal (re @n: i'm curiously asking what you guys think)

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n> no i haven't

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <n> 😁

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> I believe a market cap similar to 2017 eth is very possible for kmd. Lets be honest its 10x better and more effcient than eth currently is. But only time will tell. There is lots going on now and the tech is about ready to be mass marketed.

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> This is just my opinion take it as you will

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> Yeah i want some rick coins 😂

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> Agreeing to this. Do look to the background story how Eth broke the 100$ limit (re @CryptoNinjaa: I believe a market cap similar to 2017 eth is very possible for kmd. Lets be honest its 10x better and more effcient than eth currently is. But only time will tell. There is lots going on now and the tech is about ready to be mass marketed.)

[telegram] <n> I'm hodling 3+ years

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> There was a time when i thought eth had raised too much money in their ico so i didnt take part 🙈

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> Kmd is 100% in a better position now then it was this time last year. There is soooo many things going on.

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> When they are ready im sure it will blow us all away. I know they have been working on rebranding the products ie dex, chain maker and other things. The website is one of the last things to do and im sure they said thats being worked on

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> Look at RedFOX Labs. Look at other projects. Consider that this is the beginning.

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoNinjaa> Yeah theres Redfox , chain makers , chain zilla all these are working to bring business to blockchains mainly komodos.

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n> Looks promising

[09-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> Imagine a company like RedFOX Labs operating in the South East Asia market. Imagine that they operate in a part of the world where most countries have adopted eSports as a national sport, with emerging economies. Think about their latest additions to their team. And now consider that they are partnered with a gaming company. Consider that the future of Komodo Platform is turnkey and freedom. Now gather all these ingredients smile while you see that cocktail being brewed. It's a Pornstar Martini.

[telegram] <gigaho> Two questions: 1) does kmd cost anything to transact on using the Dex? 2) any idea how well kmd platform will scale, e.g. will it perform better than binance centralized exchange does today?

[09-Apr-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The DEX is atomic swaps, so you pay on chain transaction fees. It's on chain so that should answer your second question for speed. I'm not sure if Komodo is bringing over the 0conf feature for instant swaps, I think they are. (re @gigaho: Two questions: 1) does kmd cost anything to transact on using the Dex? 2) any idea how well kmd platform will scale, e.g. will it perform better than binance centralized exchange does today?)

[09-Apr-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think there's a DeX fee that can be added by whatever interface you use. Komodo creates the engine, so Hyperdex building on the engine can put their own fee
