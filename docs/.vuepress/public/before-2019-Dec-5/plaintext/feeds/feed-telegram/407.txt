[telegram] <Seko1900> everyone ATTN: Dear users, there was a scammer –ö–æmodo NewsBot#2758 sending direct messages to users about Agama and KomodoOceanQT wallet update. Please don't click on those links, nor download them to keep yourself and your funds safe. The scammer is using github link https://github.com/KomodoPlatforms. Notice the extra s at the end. The original/real org repo URL doesn't have this https://github.com/KomodoPlatform. If you have a github account, please report the repo and the user and hopefully github will remove the phishing repo(s).
Please remember, we will never send you DM about software updates. If there is any update we will post it on our website and in the official channel.

[telegram] <Regnar> It's important to remember that even in open source communities not everything is free. It may be free to use as an end user, like Hyperdex, Atomicdex, Utrum, Chameleon, Komodod, and countless other software in the Komodo community, but it isn't free to create.
Even volunteer developer time has costs TO THE DEVELOPER! That is time they don't get to spend with their families and friends, or working for pay. But are instead providing their skills and time to ensure people all over the world have access to top software and financial freedom.
With that said it should be understood that the basic model for open source software is that the core functionality is free to use, fork, alter etc. But there are premium versions that are SOLD. This is to help the ecosystem survive by ensuring that those devs and others get some compensation for their work, or at the VERY LEAST, cover the costs of infrastructure for the free software.
What you see in those screenshots is community members donating KMD to HyperDEX, a desktop DEX using AtomicAPI. HyperDEX is funded by hyperDEX (the person) out of their own pockets, in order to provide this awesome software.

[telegram] <chizydon> How does the staking work

[06-Oct-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> technically no staking in Komodo. You receive rewards of 5,1% per year, need more than 10 KMD in a wallet that supports rewards (Verus Agama) and claim at least once per month or else it will stop accruing (re @chizydon: How does the staking work)

[06-Oct-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> We often get massive influx of users to this group whenever an ecosystem project is doing an airdrop. All those users ask about airdrop coins etc etc. And then they never appear again. Never ask questions about Komodo or even the coin they received.

[06-Oct-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I am not opposed to airdrops. I think they are a good way of distributing coins that you want people to use, and have other uses than simply exchanging value. Especially if your target market is initially a specific community

[06-Oct-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If your project relies on the use of a coin, it's much more difficult to get new users to buy the coin to try a project. Having the coins for free as a way to get them to try it and possibly convert them to full time users is a valid reason for airdrops imo

[06-Oct-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lion_ashy> Nope. (re @PTYX11: That sounds like you just want some free coins. Airdrops aren't necessary to bring "massive users")

[06-Oct-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Oct-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lion_ashy> Altho it brings about dump in project where people have several accounts. But what if the Airdrop isn't withdrawal until a certain price like a certain block height

[06-Oct-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lion_ashy> Or until U have a specific number. This will force people to actually buy for example.
If a wallet comes with 3KMD and the minimum withdrawal for the first transaction is like 20kmd

[06-Oct-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lion_ashy> It will increase users. Have worked for a project and it moved the users massively

[06-Oct-19 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> that's not really possible. you can't airdrop a token to a non-custodial wallet and make it unspendable until a certain price point (re @Lion_ashy: Altho it brings about dump in project where people have several accounts.

[06-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Oct-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You could lock the kmd until a certain block but that wouldn't mean that it would be at a higher price. You'd need a centralized solution where you show someone balance and when CMC says KMD=x$ you can withdraw (re @polycryptoblog: Well you can but not easily)

Would be lovely to consolidate above 745-750 for a potential attack of the upper range at 850.

Breaking above 850 and this thing can definitely start to fly.
