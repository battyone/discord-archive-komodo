[telegram] <Intelligent Crypto Investor> Let's support the PRLPAY private sale

[18-Jun-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lisbon3am> Thanks for the reply! ;) (re @eMort667: The team is shooting for 1 million payments a second but so far the team has achieved and sustained 20k transactions per second or 800k payments per second. Another stress test is coming soon so these numbers should increase)

[18-Jun-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> I would love to get involved somehow, I returned home now , so I am in Czech Republic, we pretty crypto friendly I would say( gov has no idea what crypto is)  so I could spread the word here but not sure how. (re @Regnar: We, as community members, must participate more actively in the marketing efforts put out by the team, and must do what we can to spread Komodo outside of our community and circles. 80K interactions per post means very little if those 80K interactions are already followers of KMD and hodlers, we need unique interactions and new eyes on the project to truly see what it's about. That takes things like retweeting, liking, sharing, and tagging your favorite crypto influencers on the posts. it also takes finding posts where Komodo fits the topic, inserting intelligent and targeted tweets on those posts, and having the community come in and like bomb the post so everyone around that post sees it, and the strong community. So if you see a post where Komodo fits, insert something intelligent (not spam) that shows how KMD can help (ie. a coin page says "we in discussions on how to become more resilient to 51% attacks" and you insert a link of Gamecredits using Komodo to do just that) tag Komodoplatform and then post it here and try to get the community to like and retweet your post. That's what I believe we need on the social media front. community involvement.)

[telegram] <Dgbtroll> barterdex need more volume to attrack mode investor involved in komodo

[18-Jun-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed. BarterDEX is still beta right now, HyperDEX is too. I'm personally a fan/user of HyperDEX, though they are the same engine (re @Dgbtroll: barterdex need more volume to attrack mode investor involved in komodo)

[18-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <grim_tactics> Man - I have been out of the loop for quite some time and wow the markets have become stagnant. Seems a possible die off of some companies is probably not too far off. Last I heard Komodo is still performing well but of course the market doesn‚Äôt reflect that in the price.
Anything of importance around the corner for KMD or are we kind of just riding the bear for the time being.
And Regnar  hope you‚Äôve been well my friend

[18-Jun-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Hey Grim, yea I've been doing well, just trying to do my part here with some social media marketing haha. we are working on the 1M tx/s test, have a few coins lined up for dPoW protection (just did GameCredits) have some projects asking about launching on KMD, another dICO launching shortly, HyperDEX still in their beta testing but coming along real nicely. and still have KMD 2.0 marketing from Steve that's being worked on. If you check my reddit posts with Steve Lee, he's been in talks with some HK exchanges etc. so there is definitely things being done, but we are certainly at the will of the bear right now, as everyone is.

[telegram] <grim_tactics> Nice - thx for the update. Yeah life has been really busy so I haven‚Äôt been following as much as I had before. When I saw the current state of the market and certain dev teams just going silent I figured the cannibalization of certain companies may be happening.
I knew KMD has been continuing to push through this down market and that‚Äôs fantastic. 
It was only a matter of time before the market started to see through hype and that may be a boon for KMD once investor reactions switch to proof of technology over who has the best hype team.
Still holding my KMD so nice to see that even in this market we are continuing to push the envelope. (re @Regnar: Hey Grim, yea I've been doing well, just trying to do my part here with some social media marketing haha. we are working on the 1M tx/s test, have a few coins lined up for dPoW protection (just did GameCredits) have some projects asking about launching on KMD, another dICO launching shortly, HyperDEX still in their beta testing but coming along real nicely. and still have KMD 2.0 marketing from Steve that's being worked on.

[18-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Have you read the white paper ? I will recommend you reading first about DPOW delayed proof of work and how it is helping secure other blockchains from 51% attacks to their networks.

[telegram] <emmanux> Notarization. The notarization happens on the KMD blockchain. (re @zec50: Why can't we just use BTC or LTC)

[18-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> after that you should be able to start understanding more about the importance of the project, is focused in privacy and security

[18-Jun-18 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@zec50 You can use BTC as often as you're willing to pay extra fees for no other reason than devs are paid by 3rd party companies to produce results that further their own financial interests

[18-Jun-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> I think that he means on BarterDEX. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <HoHumBug> @zec50 You can use BTC as often as you're willing to pay extra fees for no other reason than devs are paid by 3rd party companies to produce results that further their own financial interests)

[18-Jun-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> KMD is necessary for security, dPoW happens on it. (re @zec50: Why can't we just use BTC or LTC)

[18-Jun-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> It secures all the assetchains.

[18-Jun-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@emmanux that context still produces the same answer

[18-Jun-18 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
one can use BTC/anything in BarterDEX the same as KMD /anything

[18-Jun-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> The importance of KMD resides in its security. It's a security hub for all other assetchains.

[18-Jun-18 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the greatest achievement of DEX is you can do anything/anything pairs

[18-Jun-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
since DEX is a Komodo project, KMD is the spotlight; however, it's not "required" in DEX at all
