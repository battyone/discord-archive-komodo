[telegram] <Regnar> HEY EVERYONE!!! 3 hours to go on this poll, if you haven't voted yet, please vote on what you think is Komodo's crown jewel. Basically what do you think is Komodo's most important technology or feature. 
Do you think it's dPoW and its ability to secure scaling chains, 3rd party chains, KV databases against 51% attacks and secured to the Bitcoin blockchain? 
Is it atomic swap powered decentralized ICOs, Exchanges?
The MoMoM metachain scaling technology that has already handled 45K tx/s and is pushing 1M tx/s? 
or is it the privacy technology like zk-snarks and JUMBLR as well as the 5.1% rewards for hodling?

[31-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yea MoMoM is some awesome stuff! there's a lot of brilliant complimenting Komodo tech. for example MoMoM is effective because dPoW secures the scaling chains. But I thought MoMoM was so cool it should be on its own. Also dPoW could be considered as an additional security feature for 3rd party chains, which led me to list it as its own feature (re @pumtchak: Voted for MoMoM scaling, still needs to confirm through tests but impressive idea :))
