[telegram] <sreinhardt> I think it's always been fair to talk about price here but most of the talk has always been about the tech. Recently, across most crypto channels, we've been overrun by people wanting "when big news?" and "how high can it go this week?" and the classic wen moons... It's annoying, pointless, thoughtless, and shallow. Looking forward to crypto being a bunch of tech people enjoying the ride in the process. Maybe we'll get back to that or at least it'll be more balanced again. Komodo is better than most still it seems since there really is so much tech going on. Big stuff. Important stuff. All the time. Oh yeah, and the "Admin contact me, I have great offer!!" 🙄

[26-Mar-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <mannyfreshuk> Guys, how long does it take for a trade order to be completed on a decentralized exchage, for eg Digitalprice?

[telegram] <Lennart> DP is not a dex

[26-Mar-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Order will be completed when the prices of buyers/sellers match

[26-Mar-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Maybe you have a big order and there's not enough liquidity

[telegram] <crypto_hamilton> Hello, I am trying to understand the staking process, any good info?

[26-Mar-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Just put it in the Agama wallet (>10) then watch it grow starting an hour later.

[26-Mar-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> The wallet can be closed.

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> It's the "I'm rich" feeling... 🙄 (re @R.: seems like before the jump from 17k to 25k nobody talked about price..)

[telegram] <yorklab> Been away on a long business travel and now very sick, so I haven't been here much, but I wanted to reply to those who speak of price and marketing. I think some don't follow close enough to see what's about to transpire:
Listen to the interview with Ben very closely.

The new gaming team is moving lightening fast. I thought it may be a while before we here something from them, but I was wrong; we may hear something soon.
Crypto Union is gearing up to launch in West Africa to help small business grow
Ben has stated, and you can read, that parts of the Re-Brand are getting closer to completion.
All this stuff is out there if you go to the Komodoplatform website and Discord.
Now the really cool part is that none of this has actually launched yet, but some (if not all) are getting close.  Komodo has a marketing team and will do their thing when the time is right but as some have said they may not need to do much by then.
On top of all this there is ChainZilla which concentrates in the Latin American region (though they can help anybody launch a blockchain) and Chainmakers which helped to launch the Utrum project.
So while you give it some time and watch as things unfold, you can do some research and find out why many who came here to check things out end up staying while.

[telegram] <crypto_hamilton> I read somewhere that I had to make transactions monthly, is this true? (re @yorklab: The wallet can be closed.)

[26-Mar-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, but it's a simple button, click it and you're done.
