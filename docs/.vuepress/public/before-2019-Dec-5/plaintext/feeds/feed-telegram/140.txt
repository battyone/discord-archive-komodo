[telegram] <Remon> I think you mean that mostly all coins are linked to bitcoin in their movement, but what do you mean with coin that wil enter the market Will put end to this? (re @sryvnna: all the coins in the market are connected to each other. All coins fall because the market falls. it is the coins that will enter the market which will put an end to this. If the new comer has a strong support and a good staff, he gets out of the falling market and climbs up.)

[24-Sep-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sryvnna> The coins are never designed to be consistently high. if a new coin has supporters, it goes directly to the market when it comes to market. and provides the most profit in the first ascent, for example btc. btc was much more valuable when it first appeared in the market and now it is constantly falling. that's why big investors are making new coins rather than investing in a coine. (re @Remon: I think you mean that mostly all coins are linked to bitcoin in their movement, but what do you mean with coin that wil enter the market Will put end to this?)

[24-Sep-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Remon> That does Apply for all the trading markets, stocks for example, so what you are saying is that bitcoin when iT first hit the market iT was beter than how iT look right now? IT went from a few cents to 6500 this time. Why would you as an investor create a new coin when for example the ecosystem is already formed, the platform is already live with an excisting coin/ token. All projects got their OWN goals and roadmap and just because the price is stable for a long time between 5800 and 7400 does not mean bitcoin is constantly falling lol. Im sorry but you need to get your facts right, bitcoin got the longest Genesis block and the most secure just like Dogecoin is a really OLd and secure chain. I definetly dont agree with you

[telegram] <Remon> This year has been a development year for a lot of good projects, the tech is being build and the ecosystems are getting ready for Mass adoption. 2019 Will be the year where big instituonal investors Will come to the party, and you Guys Will be glad that you were the innovaters and bought before the early majority did. Slowly the whole retail and financial sector Will move to blockchain/crypto. Its like snowboall effect, the businesses and companies that dont embrace this out of this world tech(internet2.0) Will fall behind with for example with KYC and with low cost on transactions for example and Will soon follow. It is not a matter if this wil happen but in what month in 2019 this Will happen or maybe early december where the final  regulation for europe Will come(20 january approx)

Just gotta wait for the big early adopters to sell their coins and refresh them to a higher valuation.
