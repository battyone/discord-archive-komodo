[telegram] <Regnar> All depends on what you're good at, if you want to get involved in that capacity, if you have marketing, programming, UX, business experience, etc there's likely roles we need help in. If you don't want to get that involved the least we ask is to like/retweet/share our team posts on various social media and learn about Komodo so you can talk about it to other people/projects :D (re @Gudneh: What would be the easiest way for me to get involved in the project?)

[telegram] <BrokenBank> Under the AMA one of the new changes was 'moving' funds every month to get the full 5%.... Does this mean 'claim' the reward, or actually move all the funds from a wallet and into another one?

[28-Aug-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> By moving it means claiming the reward each month

[28-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Great thanks. Maybe a good feature could be a reminder when it gets to the last day or two within the wallet .... I always forget to claim lol

[28-Aug-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
Likely someone that wants to fork KMD ecosystem will not find it easy to just build a new release as there are literally dozens of different components. Certainly a clone will have some value, usually 1% or so of the original. People value the team that creates the softare, not so much the ones that just make a copy

[28-Aug-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
The main issue is which version (original or clone) will be the one to make the next improved version first?

Lovely chart here.
Potential triple bottom. 
Strong bullish divergences & volume accumulation. 

Upwards potential is mainly the orange zone if you'd swingtrading this one. 

One of the best projects out there.
