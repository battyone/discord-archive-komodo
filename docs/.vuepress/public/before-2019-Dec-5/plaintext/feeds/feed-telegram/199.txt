[telegram] <FlavioDSSS> Where on the site do I see BarDEX? I just saw the AGMA wallet to download. Is the atomic swap made within the AGMA portfolio itself? That is, is BarDEX within AGMA?

[telegram] <FlavioDSSS> Why is the BarDEX download not easily identified by the site?

[31-Jan-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Because it‚Äôs still being worked on updated and messaging being composed by marketing .   Some major updates to improve usability coming,  if your not too tech savvy BarterDEX may be a little much at this time

[31-Jan-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
