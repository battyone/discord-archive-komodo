[telegram] <Caleb> Guys, the point of this stress test was not to make money. I didn‚Äôt win, and I spent the full 6 hours attempting to make swaps... 
The crypto space in general should not be a means of getting rich. The whole point is to restore the power of trade back to the people where it belongs. 
I‚Äôve invested countless hours and energy into decentralized currencies, and thus far I have not actually made any money in terms of Fiat. I‚Äôm begging everyone involved to regain perspective and reevaluate why you‚Äôre here. Otherwise the opportunity we‚Äôve been given to regain control of wealth will be gone.

When i start trade on atomic dex

For an atomic swap trade both seller and buyer must be online (re @Debodebeli: Hi, i have question

[03-Nov-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
