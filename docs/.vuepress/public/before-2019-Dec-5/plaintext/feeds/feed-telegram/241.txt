[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> English please, my friend... Most ppl here can't read your language... (re @Marshall: ﻿抓紧提币走人，okex没法玩了，又被攻击了！真的瘦不了了，在okex有人账号被盗了，为啥总是我们炒币的损失？)

[telegram] <JohDio> But dont you have some of them dying on you? (re @TonyStarkBR: Not trading (as in using TA). I buy a masternode (if value is low enough) or shares of it on a pool, wait until it give me ROI (which can happen in days), take the returns out to something else and leave the node (or shares) running while it can pay for it's hosting)

[14-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Like before it makes profit

[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> That's my idea, I just don't have time to improve my TA skills and to trade daily, so I went the masternode shitcoin route! (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: All trading just to make enough money to accumulate more solid projects like KMD)

[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> The recent market is just sloshing

[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Well thats a fair enough ratio (re @TonyStarkBR: Happened the first time I tried)

[14-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> While marketcap is still staying still st 130 billion

[14-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> now I'm much more cautious in choosing where to enter and in how make my trades (re @JohDio: But dont you have some of them dying on you?)

[14-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Palm beach did many of those (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: Random pumps that dump shortly after on random coins)

[14-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Currently I'm on 3 coins, 1 that might have a future (600% ROI), 2 recently launched (2k and 4k % ROI): in a week and a half, have already recovered 25% of my initial value (re @JohDio: But dont you have some of them dying on you?)

[14-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> Damn nice

[14-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> One of them (the 4k% one) alone has already recovered almost 50%

[14-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> In 4 days

[14-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> If I can recover my initial in 15 to 30 days, I'm glad enough

[14-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Afterwards, it's just free money printing

[14-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Then, rinse and repeat

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> 😃😆😎

[14-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Obviously, there's a luck factor also (re @TonyStarkBR: Currently I'm on 3 coins, 1 that might have a future (600% ROI), 2 recently launched (2k and 4k % ROI): in a week and a half, have already recovered 25% of my initial value)

[14-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Good luck and be careful! (re @JohDio: Sounds like I somethin I could dig into thanks man)

[14-Mar-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Actually, it was the second time...
The first time I tried this strategy and the second masternode coin I invested (re @TonyStarkBR: Happened the first time I tried)

[14-Mar-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> The real first one gave me ROI in 20 days, but instead of diversifying, I used the proceeds to buy more of the same coin

[14-Mar-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Got rekt

[14-Mar-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> 😂

[14-Mar-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> So the main lessons are:
1) beware of coins with huge ROI and just recently launched! 😎
2) if you try to do it, after getting ROI, move the money elsewhere: either to BTC or another better established project or even back into fiat. Don't reinvest in the same coin before getting ROI!
3) After ROI you essentially have a free money printing machine at hand, so do with it as it pleases you! 😉 (re @JohDio: Sounds like I somethin I could dig into thanks man)

[telegram] <Techwyrm> In 5 years how could Komodo be less than 1$ really?? Imagine the projects and partnerships. This is top 10 tech 100% sure. Launch was only just Oct 2016!! It has at least 10x'd already. Yesterdays volume was OVER 44 MILLION KMD!!(over 1/3 the mkt cap) pump or not if that's not bullish signal, i don't know what is.

[14-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RN03xx> big news coming, shared it with the team

[14-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Techwyrm> In the last month there have been at least 4 chances to earn a quick trade 10-20% gain and reinvest into kmd and build that stack to more and more staking roi. Once ROI 5% reaches a juicy daily income huge supply will lock up and we will be in the promised land of a thriving ecosystem. Komodo is continuosly innovating and pushing the envelope with tech that other crypto's can leverage and use to become stronger. The working together model is where it's at not to be crypto competitive with other projects.

[14-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Mar-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Komodo is a ZEC fork, so when ZEC has a major upgrade it's possible to make the same upgrade to Komodo, like the sapling upgrade (very big). But Komodo is a platform and really should be compared to other platforms, and for that you'll have to research.

[15-Mar-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Mar-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> By the way, there has been recently a breakthrough in relation to this.

[15-Mar-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> Do you mean that 90% of the 20k TPS would not be safe?
The idea of having the most powerful car on the market is what cryptoland needs. If you can then scale 1 million TPS, then it's better for everyone.
Teach what you are capable of and not apply it is to be like a buffoon. The only real thing is that it goes slower than the bad horse
