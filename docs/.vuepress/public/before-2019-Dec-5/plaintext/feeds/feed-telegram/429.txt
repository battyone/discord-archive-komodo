[telegram] <BegottenHickory> I'm a really old miner, I've mined been on kmd way before asics even were a thought.
But sincerly now, 70% of the hashrate is still an 'unknown miner' probably chinese.
I saw this with all equihash coins, 1-2 weeks before the bump , there appears an unknown entity wich takes over a lot of the hashrate.
First Horizen, then Pirate chain, now KMD.
