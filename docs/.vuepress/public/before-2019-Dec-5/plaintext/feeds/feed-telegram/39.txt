[telegram] <icantgiveyou> Depends on what u looking for Scott. What‚Äôs are ur specific requirements (re @Snapperscotty: Looking for opionins on which is the better Komodo wallet, the download desktop one, or on youe ledger nano?)

[27-Jun-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> Either way I would go with Trezor rather or even paper wallet for long term HODL, agama is best for KMD stash due to easy 5% claims

[27-Jun-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Snapperscotty> Will be a long term hold, was just thinking hardware wallets are more secure than the desktop ones, but the 5% is tempting (re @icantgiveyou: Depends on what u looking for Scott. What‚Äôs are ur specific requirements)

[27-Jun-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> The agama wallet is very secure as long as you got your seed and back up your wallet.dat if I am saying that correctly, than nothing can really happen.
