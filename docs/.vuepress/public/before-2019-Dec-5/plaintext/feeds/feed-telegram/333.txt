[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Luckily we were able to identify patterns re: addresses and timing. We have a very good idea about what is the activity of the hacker and what is not. We caught him off-guard, when we stared acting he had to rush and he made mistakes. (re @ionstar: Would be even more difficult to prove if it were funds that were not sweeped by the dev team but (supposedly) by the hacker. Supposedly because one could send his funds somewhere and then claim it was stolen.)

[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> yeah, very different. Not the blackchain was unsecure. just the wallet (yeah, that isn't nice either)

[telegram] <mo7881> Glad ledger wallet was safe

[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Not gonna lie this could have been an extinction event for Komodo. This is why we had to act very decisively. (re @Keytothegate: So after all there were all the ingredients of this being quite catastrophic but maybe later we can think of this being a day of victory for Komodo. Lesson to be learned of course is the wallet safety - Komodo deserves only wallets that are super-secure. And bestüôÇüëç)

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pungoio> also some legit users did send kmd to binance to sell asap  and they are getting funds not deposited (and hopefully not taken away without a reason) üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We will do our very best to compensate everyone, yes. Can‚Äôt promise it yet but that is our goal. (re @tele090: All missed coins is compensate ?)

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> We need a mechanism to make sure there are no fraudulent claims. You should take your time before disbursing any funds. (re @LuckyBTC: https://forms.gle/kAQYPcN2aEwU83av7)

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> So there was loss?

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> I hope all be ok

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yes that is unfortunate, but those funds are at the safest possible place in transit :) (re @pungoio: also some legit users did send kmd to binance to sell asap  and they are getting funds not deposited (and hopefully not taken away without a reason) üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pungoio> hopefully not everybody depositing KMD on binance looks like a hacker to binance

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> There was. We are still assessing the damage. It‚Äôs not that bad. (re @mozsi: So there was loss?)

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> No, we have a very good idea re: the addresses the hacker used (re @pungoio: hopefully not everybody depositing KMD on binance looks like a hacker to binance)

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> Its be good idea

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> I sent to binance yesterday

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <mo7881> Get that man a taqila

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Did the hacker sell any kmd?

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Yeah i get it and i guess pretty much everyone agrees on this. It was pretty crazy, radical move to do but in this case crazy worked the best. And i think it was absolutely the only move to do - in case of simply warning the community the hacker would have received the signal to act and could have done a lot more damage (re @torsten1: Not gonna lie this could have been an extinction event for Komodo. This is why we had to act very decisively.)

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> No. We plan to compensate everyone. Can‚Äôt promise this yet as we are assessing the damage, but again, it looks manageable. (re @mozsi: Burn loss?)

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> Im just wondering what to to do in such case

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I don‚Äôt have info about this but I know we notified the exchanges very early (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: Did the hacker sell any kmd?)

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> What is possible and what is not

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> If all compensated its be good marketing to kmd

[05-Jun-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> Wow (re @tele090: If all compensated its be good marketing to kmd)

[telegram] <tele090> Haha

[05-Jun-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> The right thing is to compensate people. Currently we believe it‚Äôs around 1M KMD stolen. Some of this can probably be recovered from the exchanges. James (our founder) offered to cover 500k. We‚Äôll hopefully get to compensate everyone in full. (re @mozsi: Im just wondering what to to do in such case)

[05-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> Oh i see

[05-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> Thats a good way

[05-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yea that‚Äôs what I am saying, the loss is bad but looks manageable

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> Also how are you planning on proving who owns what wallet when the seeds were compromised and the addresses are public?

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> All new people there   agama is danger for your coins send it on exch or native wallets

[05-Jun-19 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We are working on a proof solution. I don‚Äôt have the details but our devs are on it. Details later! (re @mo7881: Also how are you planning on proving who owns what wallet when the seeds were compromised and the addresses are public?)

[05-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> and what are the terms of approximate compensation and for which wallets to receive it later - will komodo refuse agama?????? (re @torsten1: The right thing is to compensate people. Currently we believe it‚Äôs around 1M KMD stolen. Some of this can probably be recovered from the exchanges.

[05-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We are still assessing the exact scope of the damage, so can‚Äôt tell now. We won‚Äôt refuse Agama, it will get a fix. We can‚Äôt tell if an address is an Agama address unless it‚Äôs on the list of the compromised wallets.

[05-Jun-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <xarux> Fine! We are still with komodo! But the team needs to seriously conduct an independent and longer audit of the infrastructure for komodo, whether it be a wallet or dex! Komodo has great technologies and ideas - but a couple of such vulnerabilities and faith in the project will be undermined and people will go to other projects!

Vulnerability discovered in Komodo‚Äôs Agama wallet - This is what...
We strongly recommend moving all funds from Agama (KMD, asset chain coins, and other assets) to a new address as soon as possible.

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Heretic> Ah ok so what should I do now?

[05-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Heretic> How can I trust some coin that team can take my money from my wallet and put it to their wallet?

[telegram] <Heretic> Even with nice idea to protect it

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> So you would rather the hacker take the money from your wallet and the team to just shrug its shoulders?

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mozsi> You dont get it. According to team  hacker was already busy doing the exploit (re @Heretic: How can I trust some coin that team can take my money from my wallet and put it to their wallet?)

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Important question, thanks for asking. As you can read in the announcement we used the same vulnerability the hacker planned to use. This vulnerability only affected a subset of specific wallets created by / imported to Agama in the last 4 months. It‚Äôs an Agama vulnerability, not a ‚ÄúKomodo hack‚Äù (re @Heretic: How can I trust some coin that team can take my money from my wallet and put it to their wallet?)

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jackabc> Is it good alternative for Agama wallet or do you recommend another one? (re @polycryptoblog: Yes)

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Heretic> No but you dont understand it. If team can do it now with good purpose it can do it later for example when goverment will make pressure (re @polycryptoblog: So you would rather the hacker take the money from your wallet and the team to just shrug its shoulders?)

[05-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Again, we do not have access to your wallet. The hacker planted an exploit and gained access to a limited number of wallets created with Agama. We used the same exploit to secure the funds. (re @Heretic: No but you dont understand it. If team can do it now with good purpose it can do it later for example when goverment will make pressure)
