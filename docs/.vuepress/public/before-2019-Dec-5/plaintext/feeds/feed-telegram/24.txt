 Im using Suprnova currently and can't help feeling like I'm getting screwed on hashrate, definitely something not right with results I'm getting. (Had miners on different pools mining different coins so I have a rough idea what should be results))

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> what i am seeing is that people is doing the wrong choices in crypto as they are doing out of crypto, i see ardor next and komodo as great technologies with potential that is incredible but people do not understand it, there is no hype about them, it is needed someone that relate with people because these are complicated matters and people is attracted only to simple facts, big numbers and announcements of announcements, i hope that like with ethereum people will understand the power of komodo and invest in it like we did.

If you can't guarantee your investors that your coin will be worth 80¢+ in 3+ years, then you shouldn't be in crypto 🙄

[21-Jun-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> .... nice troll dude (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <ComputerGenie> If you can't guarantee your investors that your coin will be worth 80¢+ in 3+ years, then you shouldn't be in crypto 🙄)

[21-Jun-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's not a troll; it's a fact

[21-Jun-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> thing is, you cant promise it. and even if you are sure that you can, you cant say that.

[21-Jun-18 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you have the financial backing to promise it (which is how serious business actually works), then it's a valid promise

[21-Jun-18 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
seems you've never been to a stakeholder/shareholder meeting for any real company 😣

[21-Jun-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> yeah, because having tokens is the same like having stakes/shares lol

Having $5 in my pocket and willing to spend it means that I can guarantee you that anything in the world is worth at least $5

[21-Jun-18 07:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
$1M backing means you can promise $1M value

Because, math!

[21-Jun-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> yeah, seems like you have no idea about regulations

[21-Jun-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763

Oh, ffs; go back to your Republican troll hole

[21-Jun-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd explain it to you, but since you seem to have some 'Murican concept about how CountryA can enact "regulations" and/or laws that govern CountryB, you wouldn't understand the words you read anyway

[21-Jun-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jun-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> They are for sure not, but id love to see the answers of the team when it comes to paying taxes and declaring profits in a country that has different laws than some south east asian 3rd world country.

[21-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> atleast you can always get your money back 🤷🏻‍♂️

[21-Jun-18 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Or, maybe they should just move to Estonia and receive rewards in their wallet when they commit useful data to the network

[21-Jun-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I was reading the above and was curious because money back guarantees are always a red flag to me in ICOs but it appears they are some big requirements for those who want the 100% money back. here's the white paper

[21-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> then the advertisement is atleast misleading, as it implies otherwise. perception is bad anyhow

[21-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> also, why do they keep speaking about a ICO, when its in fact a dICO?

[21-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> mainly you get reimbursed the money back via Fiat, not crypto, and only if the fiat price is below the fiat ICO price ($0.20) which indicates they believe the entire crypto market will rise and if they accept in KMD they can likely get plenty in rewards just holding the funds in reserve (idk if this is what they are doing) but only the private sale purchases will work for the money back, so it's likely they are mostly accepting KMD via barterDEX right now. another thing is the funds are only 100% refundable after 3 years, and they must not move from your wallet in that entire time period. so you move the funds, or sell them w.e. then you can't get it back. so there's definitely some big requirements to be qualified for it. Idk if I'm really about the "guarantee" portion, it seems like the only way they can do that is to set aside and back the funds by $0.20 per coin with actual fiat. and regardless of the price they need to keep that $0.20 * presale number of coins.

[21-Jun-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
frankly, I don't give a fek one way or the other about that specific project or your "opinion" (outside of the fact that your "opinion" has 0 basis in factual reality)
