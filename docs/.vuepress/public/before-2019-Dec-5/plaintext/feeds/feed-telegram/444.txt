[19-Nov-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> everyone security reminder ‚ö†Ô∏è
Take a note ‚úçÔ∏è about the following
1) On Discord, it is possible to change name and even the four-digit code to pretend to be someone else.
2) There have been daily phishing and scamming attempts on Komodo Discord server. Stay vigilant and help us to ban the scammers.
3) Scammers are using fake Github profiles and spreading fake wallets that will steal your coins. Don't click any links and always verify your download
4) To expose a scammer, you must allow Discord's development mode ('user settings' -> 'appearance') and copy their user ID (mine is 403137719049519106). Report the code to our CommunityModerators

[telegram] <Regnar> We have aPoW which helps protect smaller chains from diff stranding, a situation where a large miner, or nice hash, mines alot of blocks on a smaller chain  pushing up the difficulty and then leaving, making it too difficult for the regular miners to find the next block and lower difficulty, effectively killing the chain.

To achieve this, users are allowed to lock tokenized external Cryptocurrencies and withdraw upto 80% of their value in the form of the Smart Chain‚Äôs coin (a collateralized "deposit and loan" system).

[19-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Decentralized loan platforms, already in testing on some chains in Komodo ecosystem, and we didn't raise a hundred million dollars, or dedicate an entire project to it. Komodo is designed to be modular, and we add single Antara modules that can do what entire coin projects are dedicated to do!
But it's important to remember Komodo builds tools (with the exception of AtomicDEX which is a product built on the AtomicAPI, which is the tool) it's up to others to build projects and businesses with those tools, and plenty are!

[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> This! (re @Regnar: Appreciate your feedback man! Well written. About the ETH ecosystem building defi and other X Y Z, AtomicDEX definitely gets the most attention by the official Komodo team, I think it's important here to point out some of the unique technologies being developed by Komodo team and community members.
nSPV is a SPV wallet that uses hundreds, if not thousands of times less data than regular SPV wallets (think light wallets, mobile wallets, etc) and uses MBs of RAM which makes it a perfect candidate for IoT and low energy devices. On the contrary SPV for ETH and others will continue to get larger and slower.

[telegram] <Regnar> We have Gateways. Gateway Antara Module allows the user to facilitate, manage, and trade tokenized representations of foreign blockchain assets.
For example, a user is able to deposit their real-world BTC into a monitored address on the Bitcoin blockchain. Then, on the Gateways-enabled Smart Chain, the ownership of this BTC is tokenized. Only the owner of the token has the right to withdraw the BTC to a chosen address. 
This is how a lot of chains build "DEXs" but this tech has other uses and Komodo believes the Atomic Swap is the preferred and most secure method of making a DEX

[telegram] <Regnar> A lot of these tools are being used in individual developers projects, which is exactly what we want! However this means it is difficult to find all those in development, for example things I'm building I haven't put on Github and shared with the community yet. 
But there is a community run effort to find, recognize, and consolidate a listing of these types of projects. So we will keep adding them to this list. This is not an exhaustive list at all!

[telegram] <Regnar> Please see the ton of messages above. Sorry for the info overload, but I just wanted to share with you, and everyone else in here, some of the DeFi, decentralized loans, quantum security, tokens, decentralized stable coins, Oracles, and other cool stuff in Komodo that doesn't get as much attention as AtomicDEX.
üòÅ (re @Craig: Was the stress test a failure? Not if the devs got good data.
HOWEVER
As a casual investor and potential user I found it sobering.
I had seen people posting on Twitter and YouTube about how awesome atomDEX is. 
The crypto community is sleeping on the fact that the holy Grail of crypto aka a LEGIT dex is already here! 
Just a matter of time until people notice!
I was hyped! 
Then I tried it out. Almost unusable. I'm not talking about how it was overwhelmed by 160(!?) testers.  Problem is, there are absolutely no features at the moment, not even a public orderbook. Things I didn't even think were features, like charts, just aren't there yet.
To be clear, I dont blame the team because my favorite idiot Twitter personalities over promise. 
But here is how I felt after the test: 
"This needs probably 6 months to be ready for prime time, and probably a few months after that to start catching on. Meanwhile you have like 50 competitors trying to lauch their DEX in the same time frame. Not to mention the possibility that people just stick with central exchanges.
"KMD has been bleeding for 18, 20 months, maybe longer. I don't expect that to change before they deliver cool, speculator friendly stuff. I mean, look at what's happening in the ETH ecosystem, all their defi stuff. Derivatives, lending, oracle's, tons of stuff. In 9 months KMD will have a sweet DEX (we hope) but some of these other ecosystems might have X Y and Z by then, on top of various decentralized exchanges."
Anyway I decided to hold my KMD after the stress test, but count me skeptical on november's 500 to 1300 pump.)

i guess komodo bleeds differently than other projects

[19-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo is not a single focus project. Some projects focus only on quantum security, have an ICO and raise millions, we have quantum security for anyone who wants it and more. 
Some focus on loan platforms, launch a token, raise millions and everyone has to buy their token to use loans. Komodo has decentralized loans available for everyone, on any project. 
Some are just stable coins, you have to trust a centralized issuer of the coins, or centralized controller of the loan fees. Komodo has this decentralized and built into a module for anyone to use. 
New cool stuff comes about we can add it as an Antara Module, no need to ICO and dedicate a whole project to it!

[19-Nov-19 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Craig> I'm just sharing my investment thesis.
I try to keep it dumbed down and simple because have you seen the average crypto investor? I mean, be honest. Five years ago on bitcointalk people were sharp, but 2019 is a new, very stupid era.
People want to speculate on bright shiny things. 
Komodo famously has a lot going on.
 
Like, a lot. 
So take just one example.
Stable coins.
From the outside it's like, Komodo talks about the potential for stable coins. Awesome, I completely trust that they will be great. More elegant than DAI, less counterparty risk than tether, better in a dozen ways.
Meanwhile though, ethereum has DAI. Its had DAI for like 3 years I think, and it survived a crazy bear market. 
KMD has the *potential* to do stable coins. ETH has stable coins. Like, billions of dollars worth.
You know who else has the potential to have really cool stable coins? I honestly don't. But I bet cardano has plans. I bet cosmos has plans. I bet we could find 100 semi legit projects that have plans, or potential. 
I'm not trying to say anything negative. I'm not saying the Komodo *project* is bleeding, just the KMD price. I think it's fine that things take time. From the inside, I'm sure various teams have spent hundreds of man-hours working and studying Komodo stable coins, and it's offensive to say it's "just talk". But to the average spectator, compared to ETH, it kinda just looks like talk.
Tr;dr I personally don't think Komodo has the bright shiny objects that will let it sustain this kind of pump vs BTC or vs ETH
In the future I hope it will.
So I'll buy back pretty soon. If the ride continues and I can't buy back below .0001 BTC, then I hope you all enjoy the moon!

[19-Nov-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> If you had 100 billion 24h volume going through Komodo side chains, I think that would help the market cap of KMD. (Even if, logically it shouldn't)
If you locked up millions of dollars worth of KMD in a maker/dai setup, I think that would increase the KMD market cap.
+95% of stable coins run on a single platform. 
That platform has a native token that is extremely attractive to speculators. I don't think that's a coincidence, even if the causation/ correlation is confused.

[19-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Nov-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> If tether decided tomorrow to ditch ERC20 and jump onto Komodo, I would find that extremely bullish news. 
Not saying it would deserve to 100X the market cap, but it would be bullish to speculators.
But I don't want to sound obsessed with stable coins, it was just an example of my admittedly stupid investment thesis
