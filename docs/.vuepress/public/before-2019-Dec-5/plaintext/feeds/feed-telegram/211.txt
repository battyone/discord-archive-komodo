Are you wondering what #Komodo Rogue CC is? Some users said they never heard of Rogue. FYI: It was a very famous computer game in the 80s. Thanks to a community member we have a gameplay video to show you what Rogue actually is: https://t.co/NBivv3yjxl #KMD #DEX #BTC #Bloc...

I think we should support blockchain adoption, and specially in elite circles, so even if you don't read French let's crash the like button and show that our mouvement is here to stay on the long run https://twitter.com/InstitutIRIS/status/1095996870088949761?s=19  I am asking them to make a translation in English for the first part and the second one. Anyway let's make a strong push for blockchain tech . Go like the article if you can.

[telegram] <outlaw00> I have a problem with SPV mode (latest Agama 0.3.4):
I can neither send KMD nor claim interest. I only have a passphrase, no wallet file, so I cannot use native mode.
Claiming interest results in over 2GB RAM being used by the process (after many minutes of loading) so it closes and the GUI becomes blank white.
Sending KMD results in endless "Processing transaction..." after many minutes of "Verifying transaction data...".
I mined to the address btw.
What can I do now?
