[telegram] <Werxadler> Your behaviour was not ok though, it always depends how you express yourself, no reason to insult other users (re @fabian: In german kmd group they kicked me ... asked them for Person of big Sells KMD !

[26-Jun-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I guess it depends on time frame you are planning to invest or trade. Short term, like right now, guess you are right in general, in longer run it's just cheap and lots of room for growth when getting back to historically tested normal satoshi levels, and beyond of courseü§î (re @Rick: This phenominon isnt positive for alt investors overall.)
