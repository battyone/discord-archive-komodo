[telegram] <Regnar> If you ever have doubts about Komodo....
"Since komodo architecture allows a custom CC chain to inherit all the rest, in literally a weekend, I created a chain that is able to generate dilithium keypairs, send funds to a pubkey and spend those funds using a privkey.
Unlike other quantum resistant algos, dilithium appears to allow pubkey reuse. Will dilithium be the officially selected algo? maybe, maybe not. if not, i will have to spend another weekend adding a different algo" -jl777

[26-Feb-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
CC changes the consensus rules

ETH smart contracts must stay within the ETH consensus rules

to ask what can be done if consensus rules can be changed is to ask what is possible to be coded

https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml

[26-Feb-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
"The design of Dilithium is based on the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" technique of Lyubashevsky which uses rejection sampling to make lattice-based Fiat-Shamir schemes compact and secure. The scheme with the smallest signature sizes using this approach is the one of Ducas, Durmus, Lepoint, and Lyubashevsky which is based on the NTRU assumption and crucially uses Gaussian sampling for creating signatures. Because Gaussian sampling is hard to implement securely and efficiently, we opted to only use the uniform distribution. Dilithium improves on the most efficient scheme that only uses the uniform distribution, due to Bai and Galbraith, by using a new technique that shrinks the public key by more than a factor of 2. To the best of our knowledge, Dilithium has the smallest public key + signature size of any lattice-based signature scheme that only uses uniform sampling."
