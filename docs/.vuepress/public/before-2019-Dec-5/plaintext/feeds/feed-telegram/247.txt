[telegram] <daniejjimenez> ParJar is a Telegram wallet and tip bot that works with /tip messages. 
All tips happen off chain. All deposits and withdrawals happen on chain.
The bot is entirely fee less. So no fees for tipping, depositing or withdrawing. Only normal gas fees charged by the blockchain for depositing from another wallet and withdrawing to another wallet since they are on-chain transactions.
Make sure to PM @parjar_bot to check out your own wallet on Telegram
