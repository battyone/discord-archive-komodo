[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Admiin, I need help with my Agama Wallet. I sent emails to support already. Please respond. Thank you.

[telegram] <Hermes08> Hi there

[16-Jun-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> We will get back to you shortly

[16-Jun-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> I'm not  behind firewall or vpn. I'm downloading in Native mode. I'm only able to see my wallet address in the Receive tabe.  I don't see my coin balance there. Do I have to wait for its completion before being able to see my balance or use Lite mode? (re @Hermes08: We will get back to you shortly)

[16-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> No you don't need to be in that mode in order to use lite mode, they are two separate modes of the wallet,

[16-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> if you had stored your funds in lite mode you are totally independant from native mode.

[16-Jun-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Very frustrated. I have been spending hours on this wallet update. Never have a wallet that has so much trouble.

[16-Jun-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> I just downloaded the wallet on your website last night. V0.2.39

[16-Jun-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> I responded to your email already.

[16-Jun-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> While I'm having this issue, are the coins in my wallet still staking?

[16-Jun-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> KMD does not "stake", you only need to access your funds once a month, and claim the monthly reward. That's it. (re @MeiMeiU: While I'm having this issue, are the coins in my wallet still staking?)

[16-Jun-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> OK. Thank you for the clarification. Will I lose the reward if I don't claim it monthly?

[16-Jun-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Yes. at least once a month, you need to make a transaction or claim your reward. (re @MeiMeiU: OK. Thank you for the clarification. Will I lose the reward if I don't claim it monthly?)

[16-Jun-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Good to know. Thank you. I'll wait for your responding email for my wallet issue. Thank you for your help. Appreciated!!!

[16-Jun-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> No problem!

[16-Jun-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> is komodo coin or token?

[16-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Komodo is coin not a token

[16-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PHBA2061> if Komodo can reach 1 million tx/sec , and with the dPoW which makes it as secured as Bitcoin network, plus the support smart contract in in the future, doesn't it make kmd the best coin out there ?

[16-Jun-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> This is Lite mode. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

[16-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> you can change the SPV server in Settings. (re @MeiMeiU: This is Lite mode. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)

[16-Jun-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Also, beware of antivirus and firewalls, they might be blocking you.

[16-Jun-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> No firewall. Changed the SPV. Didn't work.

[17-Jun-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <crypticalthinker> why? (re @crypto_chris9922: KMD volume on Binance is 13 BTC? Is that correct, seems off)

[17-Jun-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <crypticalthinker> you can't have buyers if noone is selling.

[17-Jun-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jun-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> The support team suggests that I log in my wallet using different computer. I downloaded a new wallet in a laptop. How do I enter the wallet address to it? (re @emmanux: Also, beware of antivirus and firewalls, they might be blocking you.)

[17-Jun-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> if you were using Lite mode, you'll need your passphrase (seed)

[17-Jun-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> if you were using Native mode, you'll need your wallet.dat or exported private key.

[17-Jun-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> OK. I entered my wallet seed. I'm able to see my wallet address in the Receive tab. However, in the transactions History, it still shows "Synchronization is in progress....".

[17-Jun-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> and the error message at the right lower corner keep popping up. (re @emmanux: if you were using Native mode, you'll need your wallet.dat or exported private key.)

[17-Jun-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> oh, probably a connectivity problem with the SPV server.

[17-Jun-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Did you try changing the spv server setting?

[17-Jun-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> in Settings, i think

[17-Jun-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Yes. I did. Didn't help. Removed the pop up blocker. No firewall. Still not able to fix the problem. (re @emmanux: in Settings, i think)

[17-Jun-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You are experiencing this with KMD or other coins as well ?

[17-Jun-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Only KMD.

[17-Jun-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> open a ticket (re @MeiMeiU: Yes. I did. Didn't help. Removed the pop up blocker. No firewall. Still not able to fix the problem.)

[17-Jun-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Try with BarterDEX, you can use it as a wallet.

[17-Jun-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Only KMD. Didn't have this problem before updating to v0.2.39 (re @Hermes08: You are experiencing this with KMD or other coins as well ?)

[17-Jun-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You are using which OS windows?

[17-Jun-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> What about the coins in my current wallet? (re @emmanux: Try with BarterDEX, you can use it as a wallet.)

[17-Jun-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> With the same seed you have access to all the coins in your wallet you can use it in Barterdex Agama or hyperdex

[17-Jun-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Window 8 on desktop, Window 10 in laptop

[17-Jun-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Try seeing if the installation that you had with Agama is not corrupted or try to redownload the file from the webpage also

[17-Jun-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> OK. I need you to walk me through this process. Which website should I go first?

[17-Jun-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Go to www.komodoplatform.com and go to wallets section and download the latest version try seeing if by doing a clean download it works better this time

[17-Jun-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can also erase the Agama files located in %appdata% folder

[17-Jun-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> First and then try download the wallet

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Do I delete the entire folder? (re @Hermes08: You can also erase the Agama files located in %appdata% folder)

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> If you want to do that process use this guide to locate the Agama Folder is in %appdata% Roaming/ you should see it by typing this in your file explorer

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Erase the Agama folder and do a clean installation

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Please, don't erase ANYTHING without previously doing super safe backups.

[17-Jun-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> @Hermes08 he did a fresh installation on another computer.

[17-Jun-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Yes. I did. But that didn't help the issue. (re @emmanux: @Hermes08 he did a fresh installation on another computer.)

[17-Jun-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Yeah itâ€™s most probably Spv issue

[17-Jun-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> are you in russia? (re @MeiMeiU: Yes. I did. But that didn't help the issue.)

[17-Jun-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Try using Barterdex or hyperdex with your same seed

[17-Jun-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> I changed the server but still didn't help. (re @Hermes08: Yeah itâ€™s most probably Spv issue)

[17-Jun-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Please work me through this process. Where do I go first? (re @Hermes08: Try using Barterdex or hyperdex with your same seed)
