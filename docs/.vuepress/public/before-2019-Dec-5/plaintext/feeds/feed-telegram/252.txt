[telegram] <prblocknet> How can it be slower then btc x 30

[18-Mar-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> it is not that it was only slow, but for huobi they ask for 100 confirmations and only with that rejects any attempt to take advantage of the arbitration

[18-Mar-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <prblocknet> Also 120 from binance

[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> that's what it takes to binance to  confirm your deposit, not the blockchain (re @prblocknet: How can it be slower then btc x 30)

[18-Mar-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <prblocknet> Well shouldnt komodo team take some action about this?

[18-Mar-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <prblocknet> I mean surely we dont want this slow as transaction here

[18-Mar-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> binance should do something about it, bittrex only takes 30 confirmations

[18-Mar-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> that is about 30 minutes, the same as 3 btc blocks

[18-Mar-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> Imagine that you are the owner of the crypto and you upload the crypto yourself and download it again... Do you think it will interest you to lower the confirmations of the different exchanges? The greater the amount of confirmations, the more margin of time they have for the gazelles to see the benefit that can be had with the arbitration and they end up lowering it below the value you bought so that they get rich... now we still have to wait until April to see her climb...

[18-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I keep hearing this talk about taking a long time to send to and from exchanges, let me straighten this out. An Exchange wallet is NOT like a regular wallet. When you deposit to an exchange they DECIDE how many confirmations they want before ALLOWING you access to your funds, this is so your transaction is confirmed by hundreds of blocks making it really expensive for an attacker to 51% attack to steal them back. The coins ARE in the wallet, you just dont own that wallet or its keys, the exchange does. (re @David: Imagine that you are the owner of the crypto and you upload the crypto yourself and download it again... Do you think it will interest you to lower the confirmations of the different exchanges? The greater the amount of confirmations, the more margin of time they have for the gazelles to see the benefit that can be had with the arbitration and they end up lowering it below the value you bought so that they get rich... now we still have to wait until April to see her climb...)

[18-Mar-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> KMD confirmations happen in about 1 minute. An exchange determines how many of these confirmations it wants to wait until it allows you to use your funds. Also Withdrawing from an exchange isn't always that quick either, usually when you click "withdraw" it sends you an email confirmation, and then goes through additional checks before it decides if it wants to execute your withdrawal, which can be blocked for whatever reason... as soon as they ACTUALLY make the transaction, it's in your wallet in under a minute, if that wallet is agama you have instant access, if it's another exchange, they can make you wait their arbitrary number of confirmations again (re @prblocknet: How can it be slower then btc x 30)

[18-Mar-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Honestly you missed the boat on most arbitrage opportunities. The 51% attack has effectively halted most arbitrage because exchanges increased confirmation times to combat 51% attacks, and with that hurt arbitrage and price stability. Komodo offers 51% attack protection with dPoW which we have been marketing to exchanges and some absolutely do treat notarized transactions as immutable, but not all exchanges do. Tweet out and get the community behind getting binance and other large exchanges to lower confirmations and credit balances upon being notarized instead. Otherwise wait for KMD mm2 dex to roll out, and we'll do it ourselves (re @David: it is not that it was only slow, but for huobi they ask for 100 confirmations and only with that rejects any attempt to take advantage of the arbitration)
