[telegram] <BearTheTrader> KMD is not top marketed or top in lists, it is top notch tech, just it isn‚Äôt recognised for now and your comments are not helping just fudding and depreciating the facevalue but remember this: when the time of using the coins in real life will come like EOS we will see what happens because komodo is already working and many other features like smart contracts will come out, then what happens? the customers will want a working product, scalable, usable, not only promises and thin air like 99% of coins are.

[telegram] <Matt> And the biggest tragedy is that americans preffer dumb shit talk from a populist that makes them vote on him.. it is the same story how the voting went for brexit... the campaign for brexit was a highly populist trick with dumb lies about saving UK from immigrants and UK donating billions to EU instead of NHS ... well NHS had massive advantage of EU researches and results being shared.. UK borders were protected by EU .. in france for example.
