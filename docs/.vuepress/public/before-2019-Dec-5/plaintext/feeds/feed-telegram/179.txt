[telegram] <Acura360> - Sapling Upgrade
- VerusHash algorithm, bringing near-equality between CPUs and GPUs with the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world
- VerusPoS algorithm, allowing for a 50/50 hybrid blockchain, which can be combined with either 50% VerusHash or 50% Equihash for the proof of work component.
- Time Locking, which allows mined rewards to be time-locked for random release, within a set of parameters.
- The ‚ÄúEras‚Äù parameter (ac_eras), allowing 3 eras of different coin emission schedules to be defined which alter emission, including slow start options, and linear exponential decay at specific, predetermined block height schedules.

[27-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> What is Sapling?
Sapling is a network upgrade that introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of Zcash shielded addresses.
Improvements
Performance for shielded addresses
Payments involving the new Sapling z-addresses can be constructed in as little as a few seconds and with only 40 megabytes of memory.
Decoupled spend authority
Allows the hardware that constructs the zero-knowledge proof to be independent from the hardware that signs for the transaction.
Improved keys
Full viewing keys allow owners of shielded addresses the ability to view incoming and outgoing transaction details without exposing their private spending key. (re @icoexplorer: Do you have an article explaining sapling?)
