[telegram] <PTYX11> 51% attacks are not viruses but Komodo does protect smaller chains through a mechanism called dPoW. (re @Atlas: and i reed what  kmd  be like antivirus  for other ZEC-like coins for 51 error ))

[01-Feb-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NegnFox> when i click on the link than it shows the orignal aws website i am ok with that, but when i go to aws website and search for komodo or apn partner etc...it found nothing about kmd, thats the only quesdtion i have, thanks (re @PTYX11: What doesn't make sense?)

[01-Feb-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> how i understand dpow on kmd rerise from notarize btc blochine

[01-Feb-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> If it is still in the works and hasn't been officially announced, why would there be something on AWS prior to that? (re @NegnFox: when i click on the link than it shows the orignal aws website i am ok with that, but when i go to aws website and search for komodo or apn partner etc...it found nothing about kmd, thats the only quesdtion i have, thanks)

[01-Feb-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> so get 51 attack on kmd you need hack BTC first )

[01-Feb-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NegnFox> ok, thank you (re @PTYX11: If it is still in the works and hasn't been officially announced, why would there be something on AWS prior to that?)

[01-Feb-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You need to not only take over BTC's hashrate, you also need to takeover the KMD hashrate and notary node network to do some real damage. (re @Atlas: so get 51 attack on kmd you need hack BTC first ))

[01-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> guys so what is prediction of price ?  50k satosh ? or 100k how you think

[01-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> someone can overpower the kmd chain temporarily, but as soon as the notarization happens, the hacker can't rewind past that point. That is why exchanges can start looking for Notarizations instead of normal confirmations

[01-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Atlas> i think kmd have future if  include innovaiton like that )

[01-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
