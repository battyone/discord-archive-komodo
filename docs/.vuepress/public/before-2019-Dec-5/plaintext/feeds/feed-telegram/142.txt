[telegram] <Yous> Hi, I'm new and trying to understand more Komodo. If I undestand well komodo is building a network of parallel blockchains so each projects can have its own blockchain and consensus? Is each independante blockchain can be adapted to the needs depending of the project? How many TPS can have each blockchain? Thanks! (re @Akijoman: )

[telegram] <Regnar> So Komodo, and other projects that build with it, can scale by adding additional scaling chains parallel to the main, they all act as the main chain and are fungible and secured with dPoW to one another and Bitcoin. This is using Komodos MoMoM tech. Other coins that build with Komodo can scale in the same way and are not limited to KMD itself, and can change mining algorithms, block sizes, coin amounts etc. I'm not 100% on the amount of tx/s that can be handled on each chain, but it's being worked on for a way that automatically spawns new chains as TX amount/demand increases, and each new chain secured by dPoW. I believe that last tests had 20,000 tx/s

[telegram] <Yous> I'm surprised that Komodo can reach hight TPS with POW as many projects are having problems to increase TPS with POW and trying other consensus like POS and DPOS to have more TPS, the problem is that POS and DPOS leed to centralized. It looks like Komodo is the winner? So its too good to be true, so my question what are their challenges right now? (re @yorklab: There is no real limit to how high it can scale.

[telegram] <Yous> I looked into github but don't undestand how to know about Dapps/projects that joined the Komodo ecosystem. For me to know about Dapps already in the network is the proof that there is projects that beleive in Komodo. Hight TPS in laboratory is not like in the real ecosystem application, many project promiss hight TPS. (re @yorklab: Also, Komodo will be doing a 1,000,000 TPS test in the near future so watch for that. No theory, it's actual working tech.)

[25-Sep-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> Pirate is a 100% private coin. It ONLY does Zk-Snark transactions, so all are invisible on blockchain but requires running a full node. It is a coin built from Komodo just like other project chains. And it also has dPoW through Komodo so its entire blockchain is protected and notarized by bitcoin. Which jl777 mentions makes it the most secure and private blockchain in the world.

Using #KMD dPoW, #EMC2 blocks will be recorded in #BTC‚Äôs chain and remain there permanently. Those blocks will serve #EMC2  against chain manipulation. Based on our research this is the best solution.

[telegram] <Regnar> You have to either mine it, or buy it over the counter from someone else. It isn't on Barterdex but if you check out the Pirate channel in Komodo discord, theres a dev selling 777 pirate for 15 KMD (re @Cdude: How do I get pirate?)

[telegram] <pumba2988> If I close the native pirate wallet from agama I have to activate it everytime I open agama there's no lite wallet for pirate as of yet.
