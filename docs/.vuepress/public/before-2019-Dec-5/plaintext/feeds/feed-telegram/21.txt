[telegram] <polycryptoblog> KMD doesn't earn interest in the true sense of the word ,  it's more of a reward (re @crypshotta: i heard anything you earn interest on could be classed as a security, what makes you so sure it aint?)

[telegram] <threeridges> Skycoin is scam, exit sky add to komodo

[19-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> given how cryptomarkets work, it would make sense to buy the Skycoin dip and wait for when it pumps again. Then buy kmd with the profit

[19-Jun-18 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The simple answer (way to explain) is that interest is calculated by a transaction timestamp, you get interest based on time last spent to now; if there's no stamp then no interest and the miners get the reward.

[19-Jun-18 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
over-simplified, but close enough

@bullishgentlemn Exactly! I'm definitely partial to @HyperDEXApp & @KomodoPlatform 
with atomic swap powered DEXs, but every DEX fills a need along the spectrum of decentralization. CEXs have their place, but only if you don't give af about your money, privacy, or security...
