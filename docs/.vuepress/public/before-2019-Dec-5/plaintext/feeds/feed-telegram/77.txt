[telegram] <BearTheTrader> i am going to put a page on the blog of my wife to get tips in KMD and i see that there is not the functionality to create a barcode in agama, is that going to be done? the mobile version would really help i think the adoption if people could use kmd like i want to do and something that created a piece of code to publish on a post that moves the sum amount and the address or only the address to the mobile wallet for a faster tip experience.

[31-Jul-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ca888_v1> Why? What scenario are you wanting protection against here? Logging in to Agama on a public PC then forgetting to log out, and walking away? Not trying to be funny, I don't get why extra security layers after unlocking your wallet with the private key would achieve. Surely no need, I see extra passwords as extra hassle. One private key to get you in, then you're free, caveat emptor. This would inconvenience every user every time they want to use the service, just to help one person in an unlikely scenario. Am I missing something? (re @bitcoinfiat: @Acura360 . What I meant is different from what you sent me. What I meant was when you about sending out some KMD in agama, it should prompt a spending password before the release of the coin.)

Do you think it's dPoW and its ability to secure scaling chains, 3rd party chains, KV databases against 51% attacks and secured to the Bitcoin blockchain? 
Is it atomic swap powered decentralized ICOs, Exchanges?
The MoMoM metachain scaling technology that has already handled 45K tx/s and is pushing 1M tx/s? 
or is it the privacy technology like zk-snarks and JUMBLR as well as the 5.1% rewards for hodling?
Let us know!
