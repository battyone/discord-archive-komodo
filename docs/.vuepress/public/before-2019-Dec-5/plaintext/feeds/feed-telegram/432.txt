[telegram] <Giac0> On discord... But I'm not very easy o' discord (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <phm87> in the #start-here channel, if you click on the French icon, you'll gain access to the french speaking channel)

[telegram] <Suzy> AhahahaüòÇ (re @Sedundneszlp: The illuminati took over bitcoin through blockstream. They now want to implement digital identities. They will do this by claiming btc is a threat. So, in the future we will all have an RFID data or Biometric info upload to the blockchain for security purposes. This is what the deepstate want. Anon coins will be illegal. That is why komodo is no longer anon. The illuminati requested that they be transparent. Do your research, the end is nigh.)

[09-Nov-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Nov-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It is an important difference, one, informing exchanges of updates (what Komodo does) is good crypto project practice. The other (asking to disable deposits and withdrawals) implied a form of market manipulation which Komodo does not do, and doesn't even have the ability to do.
