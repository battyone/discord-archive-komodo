[telegram] <icoexplorer> I agree, it deserves it. I have been promoting on my twitter üëå (re @N21_0: i always feel Komodo will be back to top 10 in CMC with more tech will blow minds)

[08-Jul-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Agree that komodo deserves a better ranking.

[08-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> BarterDEX is operational and does more than beer and pizza. HyperDEX is launching soon. (re @Matt: Komodo is not the only platform heh.. well.. if kmd want to be leader in it..need to beat several competitors.
And need to be fully operational.. not only beer and pizza)

[telegram] <Crypto> Will We be listed on any new exchange soon?

[08-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Yes, we will be available on HyperDEX this week and Coinexchange.io after the airdrop

[08-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> We will announce the aidrop date in the coming days with details of the snapshot.

[08-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> it's possible we will be on another small CEX too

[telegram] <yorklab> In relation to Komodo, they will help you create you're own Blockchain, which means you will then have your own token. (re @LAP: Zilla is coin maker kit?)

[08-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It's a full blockchain as a service provider (re @LAP: Zilla is coin maker kit?)

[08-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> KMD is listed on many exchanges. some of the largest ones (re @Crypto: But i was asking about KMD:p)

[08-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Crypto> Ye i know, But more would not hurt:) (re @PTYTrader: KMD is listed on many exchanges. some of the largest ones)

[08-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Sure, but the exchanges you arw are referring to ask upwards of 20-40 btc to be listed

[08-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It's ridiculous and those funds are better spent elsewhere

[08-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> We are on Binance, Bittrex, Upbit, Hitbtc and Barterdex

[08-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <stayfrosty1> yeah, it also looks kinda sad for komodo to be begging/paying onto those scamexes when they have their own exchange platforms.

[telegram] <Regnar> any idea how many KMD are stored on Binance, Bittrex, or upBit?

[08-Jul-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I can get trading volume, but that's obviously not a good indicator of how many coins are stored there you know?

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> I'm working on collecting the exchange addresses but it's a difficult task

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Only a few are known

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> I want to exclude those from the Zilla airdrop

[08-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I just pulled this together. the exchanges are obviously off. The exchange numbers are just the daily trading volume (could be counted multiple times) as well as the sell side of order books (Binance and Upbit I can't see the cumulative orderbook sell side) And of course any coins that are being held there that aren't being traded isn't included

[08-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> but there is 9.5M KMD sitting at a single sell price on UpBit. likely to keep price from going too high lol

[08-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That's more like it. lol my bad, I listed the buy side instead of sell side for UpBit because they have the colors swapped (from intuition) and I didn't translate

[08-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> the 41% voter# turnout is actually pretty impressive. that means at least 41% of the entire coin supply is sitting in people's wallets. and minimum 56.04% of the coin supply is OFF exchanges. There's likely more from non voters, mining pools and Z-addresses

[08-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> 24hr volume from CMC (took 24hr volume of top exchanges/price on that exchange)

[08-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> then I went to each exchange and counted up the sell side orders (bittrex totals it for you, upbit I copy and pasted, Binance I had to manually type out each order total)

[08-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> the dev funds I know they had 10% of the ICO 100,000,000 coins. the votes are just the total of votes received by all notaries (1 for 1 with KMD) and SuperNET lists their asset balances

[08-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> I've always wondered this

[08-Jul-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Do we market to people who will buy and sell KMD on exchanges? or does Komodo market to businesses and projects that will build on Komodo?

[08-Jul-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Thoughts?

[08-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That's a bit much lol. What about OKEx? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> it only takes one million dollars to get listed on huobi)

[08-Jul-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Jul-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think I need to try and make this clear, marketing can be a lot of different things. It can lead to more Komodo buyers/sellers if we focus on the traders, this can lead to higher coin prices and is generally what people think of when they say they want marketing.
However, the reality is Komodo is trying to create a platform, or building blocks for an ecosystem to exist. The KMD coin is to be used in that ecosystem from Jumblr, BarterDEX, zeroconf swaps, dPoW payments, and more. So any measure of success should be in the increase of projects and companies that build on Komodo. The greater the success there, the higher the KMD price will go.
The results as investors visually looks the same, Higher KMD prices. However, how we get there is dramatically different. One way offers higher prices based on only trading volume and "new buyers" which is the greater fool theory. The other is by actually building products, partnering with companies, bringing projects to launch their mainnet on Komodo etc. which will drive KMD price because of its usage in the ecosystem. This second way will last longer and actually grow beyond the "new users" who buy KMD on an exchange.
This isn't to say we can't push for both, but the priority of the marketing team I think would be to create content that can bring projects on board, partnerships, and build a Komodo Brand that means something to businesses and investors.

[08-Jul-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but neither is about paying millions of dollars for exchange listings

[08-Jul-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Focusing on the traders would be like Apple marketing to stock traders so they buy Apple stock and push up the price, instead of building apple products that will drive usage and eventually the price

[08-Jul-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> investors understand that driving the price through action and usage is better than the price just pumping from trading volume. Apple does best by their investors by creating products and marketing those products to their end users.

[08-Jul-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
former seems not a good approach but we need enough trading to have liquidity for when people need it

[08-Jul-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I think doing the latter should get enough people interested in trading it

[08-Jul-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Like I said though, we can try and do both, which is fine. but not if it costs us $1MM to get on a single exchange, when that $1MM could be used to hire more devs, build additional applications, pay for conferences to get our teams in front of different industries, hire additional business personnel, set up legal entities etc.

[08-Jul-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> well you know that lol I only say that for the conversation here

[08-Jul-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
we can have community donations toward exchange listing

[08-Jul-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Crypt0kin> I understand, I just feel that there aren't enough exchanges to handle the demand (at this point). So I think the prices (Fees to join) are inflated. But yeah, if people want to, why not.

[08-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yea that's not a bad idea, I think the dev funds should obviously be used for business reasons. but if the community wants to raise funds for exchange listings, why not.
