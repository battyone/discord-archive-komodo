[telegram] <emmanux> Komodo rewards activity. If you're an active user, you'll automatically receive this reward.

[telegram] <emmanux> 134 is a good amount

[12-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> With that amount if you claim your interest once each 30 days instead of each two the gain is a bit bigger.

[12-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ole> Can a admin say somthing about it. or point me to the place it have been answer.

[12-Jun-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
no fork over ASIC

[12-Jun-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD might be the only original equihash coin left

[12-Jun-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but 70% of blocks are notary mined so ASIC is not a primary issue for KMD

[12-Jun-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mirai_no_senshi> you need to keep it in your agama wallet, more than 10 will generate the interest

[12-Jun-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zafar177> You need more than 10 kmd to generate interest. Your options are the agama desktop wallet or the Guarda mobile wallet. (re @threeridges: Pls inform, I am new to KMD)

[12-Jun-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zafar177> Hmm, may I suggest you do some reading, being spoon fed information is a poor way to learn.

[12-Jun-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ole> Thx. But it sounds to me that KMD will be the only target. When they cant mine any other coin. I get the point only 30% but i will be a inpact (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> but 70% of blocks are notary mined so ASIC is not a primary issue for KMD)

[12-Jun-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <threeridges> Yes, I will do it now, thanks bro (re @Zafar177: Hmm, may I suggest you do some reading, being spoon fed information is a poor way to learn.)

[12-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Is calculated on a yearly basis you should claim it monthly always. You will get proportionally the reward monthly. (re @threeridges: How interest is calculated?)

[12-Jun-18 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if KMD is the only coin that can be mmined using the ASIC, then there wont be any issue with hashrate being switched on and off

[12-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever the hashrate is, the notary effective hashrate will match it and get 70% of blocks. At worst will need to tweak a few non-consensus parameters

[12-Jun-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ole> Ok so i am right to say that, Asic will have little to no effect on kmd block reward?  Thx for taking your time to explain.

[telegram] <Ole> Then i dont understand. If i have 2 1080ti i will get more kmd if i only had one. How is it possible that Asic wont effect how many kmd mine by Asic. Is NN stopping asic somehow (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> ASIC is expected to increase the hashrate, but block reward wont be changed)

[12-Jun-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
