[24-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ash_Cool> so with new blockchain, what will be the onchain transaction speed?

[24-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ash_Cool> u mean only 60 secs to settle. Sure? (re @yorklab: About 60 seconds, with unlimited scaling.)

[24-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, from Agama wallet to Agama wallet. If from Binance then a few hours because they demand 120 confirmations.

[24-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ash_Cool> and how we ensure liquidity in the platform?

[24-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> KMD is on lots of exchanges with plenty of liquidity now. I think Binance is the only one that wants that many confirmations.

[24-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you don't want to use an exchange and don't mind paying the fee, (probably quicker if you are facing deposit delays) you can use this link. Komodo uses an affiliate program with coinswitch and receives 50% of the fee to use towards marketing and development costs.

[24-Mar-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Ash_Cool> what if i need to swap from btc to ltc. is it possible in komodo platform

[24-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That is just an affiliate program between Komodo and Coinswitch. It isn't Komodos DEX. (re @Ash_Cool: thanks just checked the platform. So swaps are only with KMD pair)

[24-Mar-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes. You would use Komodos actual DEX, I only posted that because people asked how to buy KMD and the newest version of Komodo DEX isn't fully released (re @Ash_Cool: what if i need to swap from btc to ltc. is it possible in komodo platform)

[24-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ash_Cool> got it. what is the speed in Komodo DEX in terms of TPS please

[24-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You may be able to get into the Mobile DEX beta but I think the beta group is full up right now

[24-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo DEX is all powered by Atomic swaps, so order matching and fulfillment is very fast in the new engine, each coin is still subject to those coin's blockchain rules. So you swapping KMD for ZILLA will be very fast to receive confirmations, KMD to BTC will still have to wait for BTC confirmations, however the coins will appear in your wallet immediately as they wait for confirmations (re @Ash_Cool: got it. what is the speed in Komodo DEX in terms of TPS please)

[24-Mar-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So as you trade it will be swapped immediately, but because it's on chain you still should be aware of confirmations.

[24-Mar-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You fork what you want to work on, work on it and update your forked repo, get it so it works correctly, others try your fork to make sure it's good, help test, make additions, then they submit for merge, the code gets checked again to make sure it doesnt break things and then finally merged into komodo main branch.

[24-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Otherwise you'd have tons of testing and additions that could force Komodo miners onto forks, or have security holes etc. The purpose is not to do testing on a chain with investors holding coins worth over $100MM. So go into discord, check out developer lounge and look at the repos they are working on BEFORE they push to Komodo main branch.
