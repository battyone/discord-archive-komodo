[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> True words, I am convinced by KMD that it will be a big number. (re @barbierir: this point implies that blockchain tech has no other use case than speculation, that existing network effects and money trump everything else. So it's better to extract as much gainz as possible and exit before it all crashes down in due time. The other theory is that it has real use cases and that it all seems equal, for now, only because no project has scaled to mass use (yet). Ethereum has a lot of momentum but even the best case for Eth 2.0 is orders of magnitude worse than Komodo for real world use. Eventually if people want to build real stuff they'll need to use what actually works. They won't spend 10x time, money and effort when they can do the same for 1x. The reactions seen by people when they discover Komodo tells it all. When all pieces are in place, it will shine.)

[24-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> you can actually use tools like octapost to take the same message and send to multiple platforms..sounds redundant put some people prefer certain social media mediums and it improves the overal SEO score. the thing is "Time" is also a variable..which is why these platform accounts need to be created sooner than later. For example: a brand new company FB account that posts about KMD will have a lower chance of becoming visible to users based on SEO than an aged account

[24-Apr-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Agreed. I think there was talk of using Hootsuite a while back to spread across different social media, not sure where it is now. But also thinking about who the end target market is for Komodo, I think will narrow down where marketing will focus. I assume they will still hit all the basics but heavy focus on the areas where the target market is. (re @TheoHx: Even a simple YouTube channel where you talk about the same thing as the tech Tuesday would be a good start. Videos have a higher impact rate and can be shared across multiple mediums.

[24-Apr-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo is developer and business focused, the traditional avenues are heavily skewed toward KMD investors but the less known channels are where we likely will gain actual adoption. I'm not sure what the plan is for all this, hopefully we find out more soon

[telegram] <TheoHx> organic growth through social media is a 0 cost and just takes time..even if you post to something like Instagram where you will probably have 0 direct traction it will still indirectly help your other media outlet's score and ranking... <- this is what most people dont understand

[24-Apr-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There is a reason why Komodo has Twitter, LinkedIn, facebook, reddit, blogs, YouTube (though no Instagram yet). I definitely agree they need to keep these updated. When I say investor skewed, I'm talking about the typical crypto news sources which are almost all paid for, even YouTubers charge in the tens of thousands. It's a slow process indeed but that's organic growth.

It is a good time to start making people hungry, that's why Komodo is doing a rebrand. It's also why companies and projects building on Komodo are expanding their marketing too. (re @Snail: Show some data....
