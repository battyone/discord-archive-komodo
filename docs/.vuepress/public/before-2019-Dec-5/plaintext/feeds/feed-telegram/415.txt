[telegram] <Regnar> Tough to tell DeX volumes tbh, I've tried. Right now you basically have to calculate it by watching the DEX fee addresses and calculating the trade amount. But I saw some reports of people who did this (re @Bar_Harbor: What site is legit on dex volumes)

[telegram] <C_Sensei> Sometimes it feels like, that the BTC market holds back most of the alts reaching their potential either by killing them off by these market manipulations or simply hindering their actual value to surface thus leaving them to be forgotten (re @Deadpool1001: I have been following crypto markets for 8 years now.
