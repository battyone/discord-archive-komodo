Gaming & Collectibles  - it's been a great week for the @KomodoPlatform as development continues. To celebrate here's a #cryptopuzzle with 77.7 $KMD in a locked address. Got what it takes to solve it? The solution can be found in their latest article - https://t.co/C27S1NU...

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Try reinstalling... Maybe it has corrupted somehow... (re @outlaw00: Thanks, I tried that. Same problems with Server #2, and mobile wallet is stuck at verifying transaction data)

[14-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <outlaw00> It's solved. There were too many utxos so I had to lower the amount sent / split it into couple txs (re @TonyStarkBR: Try reinstalling... Maybe it has corrupted somehow...)

[14-Feb-19 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Then, it might be a good idea to consolidate your balance in a single  UTXO from time to time (re @outlaw00: It's solved. There were too many utxos so I had to lower the amount sent / split it into couple txs)
