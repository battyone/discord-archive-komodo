[29-Sep-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> For real though. If you guys want marketing you r really missing one of the biggest groups of prime targets 🎯 there is. Make deals with these dudes and kmd goes off. I can promise it’s a better plan and more effective than anything “ideas by nature”is doing

[29-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptomuse2018> Yes it about community these days!

[29-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptomuse2018> You need community you do not need brand building
your brand is fine

[29-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptomuse2018> you need to market the fact that your TPS is actually so high that is suitable for mass adoption

[29-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptomuse2018> Thats all nothing more nothing less

[29-Sep-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> People love donating and watching on twitch. Make a deal with a big streamer (s) have them put a kmd logo on their screen overlay. Have them accept kmd as a payment.

[telegram] <PTYX11> Focus moved away from the traditional barterdex gui to Hyperdex. The marketmaker 2.0 is being worked on as well.

[29-Sep-18 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
since barterdex gui is doing all it needs to do for it's advanced audience, and only updates it was getting was coin addition updates, those updates stopped after CoinsDB feature added to barterdex. since then there's been no need to push new updates to this advanced barterdex gui.

[29-Sep-18 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since we are much better version of barterdex being in the works by HyperDEX team, that's the obvious choice for a new trader to introduce to barterdex.

and it's fantastic!
