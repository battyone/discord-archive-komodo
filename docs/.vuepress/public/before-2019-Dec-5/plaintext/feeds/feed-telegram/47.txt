[telegram] <BearTheTrader> is there something with charts about the pairs traded on the barterdex or hyperdex for people to ti analyze? thousands of people use tradingview to do TA and then act on them, i believe if there was such thing the only real DEX komodo created would be recognised as a real exchange by more people

[telegram] <ch6ris> Yes that's fine you actually don't have to activate it. It all hapens on the blockchain. In lite mode chainzilla will be the same address as your komodo address. (re @DingDongSoLong: And last thing, is it ok if it‚Äôs in lite mode?)

[telegram] <barbierir> atomicwallet.io ? From what I read a few weeks ago, it uses atomic swaps for otc trading, there is craig-list type orderbook

[telegram] <barbierir> while barterdex does automatic ordermatching

[10-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> does it have working atomic swaps? it look awful lot like Exodus for mobile devices with changefly instead of shapeshift. And it wont even come up in google search i had to look for it directly (re @N21_0: yes it's working product with desktop app also working with crosschain direct to changlly as a partner)

[10-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> but keep eye on it

[10-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> yes, but now they have a app for public users

[10-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> they act as decentralized escrow and allows them to skip all the utxo part, but it's quite different from barterdex. Frankly I have many unanswered questions on it, I haven't yet tried it

[10-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> yes they have working atomic swaps, sure we need to keep eye on it (re @icantgiveyou: does it have working atomic swaps? it look awful lot like Exodus for mobile devices with changefly instead of shapeshift.

[10-Jul-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> the escrow should be atomic in the sense that the swap either it happens or not, and they don't control your keys
