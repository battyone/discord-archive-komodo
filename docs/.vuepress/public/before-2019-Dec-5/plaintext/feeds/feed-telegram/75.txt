[telegram] <pumtchak> wow, how is this satoshi nakamoto guys ? And what is this bitcoin he talks about ?? The fact is, you're right, many of the developer of Komodo are anonymous (pseudonimous to be exact). But they are well alive, and you can talk to them on Discord. And yes the main developer JL777 (who you can find the real name easily) wants to stay anonymous, but the guy know his subject... pretty sure he can rebuild bitcoin blindfoldly from scratch ! Real dev does not need a pretty picture, you know üòâ (re @Titanic Furniture: Whoah! What the f**k is going on with the Komodo team page... Instant loss of credibility! What are we? 8 years old!?)

We want Min-Liang Tan
 to see that we aren't here to mess around or blow up his twitter with "check out X" tweets that provide him NOTHING but a name to go on. We want to show him that we are the best platform to build on for a company.
