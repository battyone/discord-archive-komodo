[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Make a shortcut to your miner on your Desktop and just press Enter on it to start mining ) Every OS provide shortcut functional by default ) (re @tese22: Noob question: why is not possible to start mining (kmd or any other coin/token) just pressing one button?

M using portable and works fine for me..

[30-May-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Portable is the same as version with installer. Difference only in installer.

[30-May-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> That should be easy if you know how to configure a miningrig or smthng like that. I was in the suppose that somebody that doesnt know anything about mining and wants to start doing it with his laptop or home pc (re @OneGuyFromInternet: Make a shortcut to your miner on your Desktop and just press Enter on it to start mining ) Every OS provide shortcut functional by default ))

[30-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Unfortunatelly KMD mining is not more actual on laptop or home PC, even on GPU rigs. For KMD mining you should buy at least one Antminer Z9 Mini.

[30-May-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Or Z11 ... that is more better.

[30-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Also there is tons of various guides "How to mine ... " for any coin. Just need to search with Google.

[30-May-19 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> That wasnt the answer I was looking for but thanks for your explanations

[30-May-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> Ive done that sometime ago but I dont have coding skill. When I start reading how to mine kmd for example, I get lost in the first lines (re @OneGuyFromInternet: Also there is tons of various guides "How to mine ... " for any coin. Just need to search with Google.)

[30-May-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> Equihash (KMD) miner can be designed as app with one button "Start mining", but this will be non-profit, bcz even GPU rig with 6 x GPUs gives you lower income than just one Z9 Mini.

[30-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> So, no sense to make such app.

[30-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <tese22> Thanks bro!

[30-May-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> That's why nobody make such app, bcz nobody needs it.

[30-May-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> For home PC - VRSC (VerusCoin) is preferrable solution. You can stake VRSC even on home PC or your laptop.

[30-May-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tese22> I was thiking about making mining accessible to everybody, but if there arenot coins with easy mining this is useless as you said (re @OneGuyFromInternet: That's why nobody make such app, bcz nobody needs it.)

[30-May-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> May be you should look on NiceHash app? It's very easy to use.

[30-May-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
