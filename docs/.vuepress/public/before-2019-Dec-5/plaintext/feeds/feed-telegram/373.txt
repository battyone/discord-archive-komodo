[telegram] <RAHUL> Day by day going down.

[26-Jun-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as day by day  BTC Dominance:  61.8% goes up, then it will continue

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
up almost 2% in one day

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> In your opinion alts will recover ?

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
of course

[telegram] <virous77> Hey

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine a very big dam that is blocking all the water downstream. that is the BTC dominance. the higher it goes, the more water on the other side of the dam. it cant keep rising forever... and the more water that is collected, the more will eventually flow

[26-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> The question is

[26-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> When btc stop rising 😂

[26-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> Will*

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
some say 20k, others say 40k or even 100k

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that it keeps rising without any corrections

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that makes it easy for people to just convert to BTC and wait

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
until the uptrend weakens a bit so there is risk to keeping it in BTC, people will just keep it in BTC

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> Thanks

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> So for a trading view now it is better to buy btc

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> And then alta

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> Alts

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> Like komdo ahah

[26-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to predict the path things will take

[26-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
for all we know, today is the peak BTC dominance for this cycle

[26-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
which would mean alts only go up from here for a long time

[26-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
watch the BTC dominance, predict that and you are ahead of the crows

[26-Jun-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
crowd

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rick> This whole situation isnt going to help alts in long term. The first priority for any alt is  decoupling of btc pairing. Everytime its a massacre, a selffulfilling prophecy.

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
most alts are traded at their fiat price

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what we are seeing

[26-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rick> But everybody looks through the btc glasses

[26-Jun-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so if BTC doubles in fiat price, alt prices go down 50% in BTC, but stay the same in fiat

[26-Jun-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
not everybody

[26-Jun-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
a few percent are selling based on fiat price

[26-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
