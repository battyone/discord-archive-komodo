[telegram] <Regnar> I do remember you saying that, though I wouldn't say jl777 is a cult, or that there is a cult following around him, nor are we trying to make one. People have been generally interested in lead devs of any project and jl777 has done dozens of interviews over the years and is available to talk to in discord at anytime, he even has his own channel :P (re @Murat: Ragnar .... I said komodo or founder must be cult... look at JL777 ..I am happy..)

[20-Aug-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And I don't think cult factor is important. IMO it creates too large a central failure point. Look at the price of LTC when Charlie Lee said he sold all his, and just imagine what would happen to ETH if something were to happen to VB, or BCH if something happens to Ver, and so on. So I think we can share jl777's vision and have conversations with him but the focus should be Komodo as a project, not a single person, because it isn't a single person. I think jl knows this as well and doesn't talk about non crypto stuff, or try to build a cult following by talking about random politics, religion, etc.

[telegram] <Regnar> It's better this way imo, but I know you may disagree, that's fine. I'm sure both methods have their merits

[telegram] <Regnar> HEY EVERYONE! Another crypto orientated instagram page with 30K followers is talking about the China listings (focused on EOS but Komodo's name is up there) go show KMD some love! Pages like that are interested in what their viewers like and if they see a lot of Komodo love they may look into the platform more and post more content about it! Plus we want their followers to see KMD love too! So if you have an insta, go like and comment about Komodo!
