[10-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> Komodo is the coin to pay for notarizations and contracts on Komodo.

[10-Jul-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> ChainZilla is to pay for services rendered by the company. Additionally we will use the chain as a second tier of notarization in the future. We will distribute votes based on Chainzilla holdings. We can't use Komodo for out entire company but we do add it to our business model and in our eyes, it's the best platform to launch a minimum viable blockchain.
