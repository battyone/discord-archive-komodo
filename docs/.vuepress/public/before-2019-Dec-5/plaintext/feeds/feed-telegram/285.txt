[telegram] <tim87> nice seems easier than i originally thought (re @freerider101: To perform an atomic swap, both assets are locked up in a 2-of-2 multisig address (with a timeout that allows the original owner to reclaim it). At least one of the two networks has to support Schnorr signatures (preferably both).)

[30-Apr-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JaySave75> Komodo is incredible yet I hardly ever hear any of these famous YouTubers talking about it. It feels like very few really know anything about Komodo.

[30-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <audreyandersen> but as what i've saw in komodo's documentation, it has great missions and its plan are very much realistic and so I think it's a good project to invest with. (re @IntenseBike52: The marketing for Komodo isn‚Äôt as strong as it is with other cryptocurrencies. But Komodo could gain more traction and adoption in the market if it did a better job on its product development. Markets should follow up soon)

[30-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NightEve> agreed, I like the fact that it's profitable as most people have evaluated it, but honestly there is so much competition in the platform space and it seems to me like Ethereum is far ahead of the pack at this point.

[30-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pattersonbrad> Good thing there's no much bragging up KMD, though a solid project and one to be definitely excited about going forward indeed. Guess things will turn around when most don't expect it when it feels too painful to buy, that's probably a very good time to actually buy!
