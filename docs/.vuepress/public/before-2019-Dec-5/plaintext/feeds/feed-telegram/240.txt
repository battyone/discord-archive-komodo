[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Exchanges hold deposits for lots of confirmations as an additional security measure against double spends,  they don‚Äôt need to with KMD but still do anyway to play it safe

[14-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <GarvinY> KMD is put into the wallet, 5% per month?

[14-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> 5.1% a year. If you do not claim monthly you will stop incurring rewards at the one month mark. Once claimed you will again start collecting rewards.

[14-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> I put all of mine into my wallet and I‚Äôll just open up agama lite once a month and claim them.

[14-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <GarvinY> How can I get it monthly?Put kmd in  wallet for a month?

[14-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <wktong> Consider to buy some Komodo now.

[14-Mar-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> A few hours after you deposit it in agama you will notice a ‚Äòclaim‚Äô option that will show the amount of KMD you have gained since holding them in the wallet. If you don‚Äôt claim that once a month the number will stop getting bigger. (re @GarvinY: How can I get it monthly?Put kmd in  wallet for a month?)

[14-Mar-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> If you claim it more often than once a month make sure what you are claiming is worth more than the transaction fee.

[14-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
