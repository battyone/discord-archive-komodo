[21-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> It depends on how much you wanna invest really. I would start with silver&gold, then land, property and stable established business. You can also go for collectibles but that requires proper research. And if u still got some left ...yes u can invest in bitcoin. Just saying

[telegram] <vango28> Hi today I have found out that my Agama Wallet was hacked and someone moved my KMD to another wallet. I was shocked, never happened on any other coin before. I filled out the form that Komodo foundation provided. I created the Komodo wallet on Verus Agama as advised and created a Light wallet for KMD. Instead of ‚ÄûDiscord ID‚Äú which I don‚Äôt know what it is I have entered my gmail address, I hope it‚Äôs find. When can we expect to get the hacked KMD back? Is there an admin I can contact??

make sure to send the coins to the same address you claimed and the next day or two, it will be processed

[telegram] <icantgiveyou> Quite the opposite, silver as #1 imo check out JP Morgan position in silver, they pretty much own vast majority of actual psychical silver today. They been hoarding this for years, just as Warren buffet was before just several times over.

[21-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Also, if I'm not mistaken, other projects that use the same back end market maker (MM2) and liquidity pool will also pay same fee. It is also a good chance that KMD will be one of the base pairs on those other projects.

[telegram] <PaulMakds> Dear members, btc hit 10k ? 
Today is the day. 20 hours left and we will mass buy a coin. The team is totally ready. The strategy will be the same as last pump. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. 
üìçLink open only 24H : https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFJRX6T3CeJfRGZEUA
The helpers got hundreds of DM's about if this is going to be a rank pump or not. Like we stated in the Discord. The rank system is close to being ready. This means, that this pump it will still be free-for-all. Like last time everyone will receive the coin signal at the same time!

fiat prices are mostly stable but during a storm it is natural for some things to get out of alignment for a bit

[22-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
when the bull stampedes, everything gets out of its way

[22-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
normal process

[22-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the good news is that this is pulling in fiat into the crypto space

[22-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
when the dominance comes back down, by DEFINITION, it will mean that on average the alts are gaining in BTC price

[22-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the peak of altcoin price in fiat will be AFTER BTC has peaked in the bull cycle

[22-Jun-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
we are only 6 months from bear market low

[22-Jun-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if this is too stress, turn off the charts. nothing can be done, nothing at all, during BTC dominance surges

[22-Jun-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
alt season is likely 6 months or more away

[22-Jun-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the good news is that the longer it takes for BTC to peak, the more money has flowed into crypto

[22-Jun-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if you are day trading, then on any given day some random coin out of the 10000+ will be making big gains. good luck finding, buying and selling 100% precisely. if anybody can predict this consistently, they can make 1000x per year gains

[22-Jun-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> True words, it's like always! Patience

[22-Jun-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> This reasoning is only correct when you holding crypto as you main asset,BTC is over 10k its basically at 60% of its ATH while KMD is at 1/10 of its heyday price. Before BTC was pulling the whole market for years and all alts where going same direction now it‚Äôs the opposite. That confirms what I was always saying, BTC is gold and the rest is just speculative asset.

[22-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
until altseason, yes

[22-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
first BTC will have problems with mempool backlog (as it always does)

[22-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
then BCH goes bonkers as the alternative, ETH recovers as it is ETH

[22-Jun-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
people start worrying BTC wont be the future

[22-Jun-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
dominance falls

[22-Jun-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
then and only then can altseason begin

[22-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763

whatever the market cap is, KMD is currently under 0.1%, so it has a long ways to go
