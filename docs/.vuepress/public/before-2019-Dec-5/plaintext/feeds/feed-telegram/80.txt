[telegram] <JamPhish> Hoping KMD does not end up like Augur

[telegram] <JamPhish> 😜

[01-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> I see 90% traders treat btc as center 😀 (re @emman_utrum: Big whales are humans. And as such, they have a centralized mindset. It's easier to digest. They think that BTC is the center.)

[01-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> 50% . . . As of today (re @Ming 明: I see 90% traders treat btc as center 😀)

[01-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Many traders use stables

[01-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> It was probably better when only BTC for a stable

[01-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> More stable than alts

[01-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> It would have kept the Crypto more stable

[01-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> In terms of value going back n forth

[01-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> ok why you mentioned Augus i see its ranking still high 😃

[01-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> I use BTC as SAT index to indicate buys / sells on top alts that have Stable pairings

[01-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Augur (re @Ming 明: ok why you mentioned Augus i see its ranking still high 😃)

[01-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Many korean users use the korean fiat currency to stabilize, they have a pair.

[telegram] <Crypto> Why is augur so special?

[01-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Crypto> There are a lot of companys that doing market predictions

[01-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> like banca ? 😂

[01-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> None of them decentralized. That's why I insist with Utrum, a project born in the Komodo community. (re @Crypto: There are a lot of companys that doing market predictions)

[01-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Thanks for marking! He is scamming peoples with my username (re @Sagarmatha: @Acura360)

[01-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Does Utrum have an Assassination Market? (re @emman_utrum: None of them decentralized. That's why I insist with Utrum, a project born in the Komodo community.)

[01-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> banca ai alway recommend u to hold 100% ratio of banca for safer investment 😃🤣

[01-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> I would guess China Gov would not be happy about such a thing (re @JamPhish: Does Utrum have an Assassination Market?)

[01-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> There is no volume, we just started, the price needs some support right now from investors.
Development is going better than price. (re @JamPhish: Does Utrum have an Assassination Market?)

[telegram] <emman_utrum> Until chinese learn how to perform atomic swaps. (re @Matt: China will only allow a crypto that is 100% state owned or controlled .. both by prefference)

[01-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> its volume recently so high (re @JamPhish: EOS)

[01-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Centralized mindset again. Those projects represent the past. (re @Ming 明: its volume recently so high)

[01-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ming 明> yep, i did't buy any piece of eos (re @emman_utrum: Centralized mindset again. Those projects represent the past.)

[01-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> "block producers" ffs...

[01-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Should buy what can return good profits.. or someone else will and you missed out.

[01-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> In the short term, that can work well for you, but in the long term... You're killing projects that could save the industry (by investing only in high ROI "projects").

[01-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Like, how do we want to be during the next crypto winter? 
This, right now, it sucks. I want a better market next year.

[01-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> I'm not in EOS

[01-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> How can i kill by trading? Providing liquidity is a service that is rewarded if well handled.

[01-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Next crypto winter im a buyer with a considerable larger fiat balance

[01-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Crypto is going to come up with economic vechicles that only accure value

[01-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Im a trader... maybe.. traitor? 😉

[01-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> If everyone invests and never sell or hodl till the moon... who will fuell the rocket?

[01-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Make the Investment Good and there will always be more and more investors (re @Matt: If everyone invests and never sell or hodl till the moon... who will fuell the rocket?)

[01-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Maybe there are two types of traders? Ethical traders and unethical ones?

[01-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Trading can become investment as long the project and market pricing keeps going in the right direction.

[01-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Put me with the unethical.. i go for profits

[01-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Think about this - What if, coins were sold by the project at a retail cost (re @Matt: Trading can become investment as long the project and market pricing keeps going in the right direction.)

[01-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Invested in tobaco industry, oil, gold .. whatever 😂

[01-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Chinese pork companies etc...

[01-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Think about Retail (re @JamPhish: Think about this - What if, coins were sold by the project at a retail cost)

[01-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> This is an interesting problem.

[01-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> That retail cost holds a value

[01-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> So (re @JamPhish: That retail cost holds a value)

[01-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Why wouldn't Mercedes Dump???

[01-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Government backed cryptos will bring some new factors to this problem equation.

[01-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Because, people bought at retail cost

[01-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Now

[01-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> What happens if retail costs slowly go up over time???

[01-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Do you think that coin would dump??

[01-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> It still could, but not nearly as easy

[01-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Especially because

[01-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> What if that retail coin that was sold, was redeemable for something

[01-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> So now, If I purchase it on open exchange - maybe someone wants to exit - but - they are not going to dump it - because they could just redeem it instead

[01-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> This holds the bottom

[01-Aug-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> And if we increase the retail value over time . . . our digital coin now becomes a great longterm investment

[01-Aug-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Word spreads about our great long term investment - and prices shoot up - As prices shoot up on the open market - our Retail Price responds by going up

[01-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> In this example, we have a system of two markets that are influencing each other reciprocally

[01-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> This is why, Bitcoin needs alts, & alts need Bitcoib

[01-Aug-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> 🤙

[01-Aug-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> interesting (re @JamPhish: This is why, Bitcoin needs alts, & alts need Bitcoib)

[01-Aug-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emman_utrum> Maybe too many people bought into the "store of value" meme.

[01-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JamPhish> Its an ecosystem design - they both need each other

[01-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
