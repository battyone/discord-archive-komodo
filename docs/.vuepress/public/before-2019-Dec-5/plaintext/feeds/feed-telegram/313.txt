[telegram] <Regnar> Its saying what do you want this wallet to be called? "Main" or w.e.

[30-May-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> That sounds like desktop "Lite Mode"

[30-May-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> If it's too weak then enter a longer name.

[30-May-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I don't think spaces are allowed.

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes. So Agama lite mode uses seeds, when you restore, you are putting in the seed of a wallet you already have. Agama will then say "I'm going to save this seed and encrypt it with a password and wallet name, what do you want the wallet name and password to be?" (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: When i restore?)

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> No for my already in use pin

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> So I reset my pin?

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> In agama desktop?

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Yes

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Ive only used phone

[30-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It is different then the pin in your agama phone

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Just downloaded windows 64but

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You are giving it a brand new name and password

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jaime_Meneguele> I used 24 words in desktop with space.

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Ok so i set a new desktop pin?

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Ok thank you let me try

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes, but a password, not a short number. (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: Ok so i set a new desktop pin?)

[30-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jaime_Meneguele> In lite mode. And everything is ok. (re @Jaime_Meneguele: I used 24 words in desktop with space.)

[30-May-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> That sounds like the seed, not the PIN. (re @Jaime_Meneguele: I used 24 words in desktop with space.)

[30-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> THANK YOU SO MUCH MAN I WAS FREAKING

[telegram] <yorklab> Glad it's OK

[30-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Didnt realize had to create new password

[30-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Thought it would need the one i already made , thank god for my keys

[30-May-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, if you have your seed you can always get access.

[30-May-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> If I lost my id I couldnt get my money till I went and bought a new one this way i have those words can transfer 10 million with a phone call ??!! Really

[30-May-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Seeds are the 12-24 words you are shown when you create a wallet, they are basically your private keys, NEVER share them. They can be used in any lite wallet to access your funds. The pin and passwords you see on Agama are like locks on your phone to prevent someone from opening the apps. They don't do anything except lock your app. So a pin from mobile doesn't do anything for the desktop wallet and vice versa, but the seed, because it's your keys, will give you access

[30-May-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> When you think about it dont even have to transact could just give cz my keys and bam 50 mil untraceable

[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> You guys rock thats why im so heavy , very surprising noone really knows they already kicking ass in a 200 bill maket nm their dex 2 coming out all decentral exchanges will be the future atomic swaps

[30-May-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> üëç just remember, store your seed somewhere safe, don't leave it screenshot on your phone or something (people do it) those are your keys and whoever has those owns your coins.
The pin, password, and wallet name have nothing to do with the blockchain or your funds. They are only to lock the app so someone who steals your phone can't gain access. 
Think about your phone lockscreen passcode. That protects the contents in your phone. Those pin/password protect the contents in your wallet (your seed). So a phone pin won't unlock a wallet on your computer. (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: You guys rock thats why im so heavy , very surprising noone really knows they already kicking ass in a 200 bill maket nm their dex 2 coming out all decentral exchanges will be the future atomic swaps)

[30-May-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763

ZEC is 96% transparent and 4% zksnark, which defeats the purpose and as the paper shows allows it to be deanonymized

[30-May-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is zksnark only for user transactions

[30-May-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
mining has to go to transparent addresses and so do notarizations

[30-May-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so yes, my opinion is that PIRATE is the best privacy coin on the market right now
