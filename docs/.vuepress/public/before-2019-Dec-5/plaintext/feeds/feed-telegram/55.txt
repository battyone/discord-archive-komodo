[telegram] <Acura360> Zilla Airdrop Details: How to participate in the Phase  1 Airdrop?
Download the latest Komodo wallet and hold 500 or more KMD in one address by August 15, 2018 which is the day of the snapshot. The aidrops will be distributed two weeks later on August 30th, 2018.
The 1,00,000 ZILLA will be divided among the addresses with 500 KMD and above based on their balance.
i.e. If you have 500 KMD you will get 1 share. If your address holds 1000 KMD you will get 2 shares. If the address holds 750 KMD you will get 1.5 shares. If you have 499.99 KMD you will not be included in the snapshot.
Based on our calculations, if we divide the entire Komodo supply by the amount of the ZILLA available for the airdrop we estimate that an address with 500 KMD will receive around 4.8 ZILLA. We will know an exact number after the snapshot since it depends on how many addresses hold the required balance to qualify for the airdrop.

[telegram] <bpetridis> No store is going to use a pos based on a token. Pos systems are so ingrained they are so difficult the change. If anything if they start accepting crypto as a payment method then komodo is the only platform that will handle point of sale volume.they just need ro link the existing pos to the kmd apis. (re @N21_0: they try to make pos in some store's, but this idea it too classic and crypto really don't need this shit
they try to sold max because there is no future inside they know that as well no worrys)
