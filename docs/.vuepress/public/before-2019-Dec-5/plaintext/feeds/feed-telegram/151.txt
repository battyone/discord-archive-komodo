[telegram] <yorklab> There is no .dat file in Lite, only your seed; that's all you need. (re @pumba2988: How do you get your dat file from. Agama I use KMD lite and I activate pirate native.)

[03-Oct-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <pumba2988> Only way to create a pirate native wallet is to activate it through KMD lite wallet.

[03-Oct-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Pirate only runs natively , you are not using lite mode. Your wallet.dat file location is here depending of your OS https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000010755-where-are-the-wallet-dat-files-saved-for-komodo-on-agama-if-using-in-native-mode-/en (re @pumba2988: Only way to create a pirate native wallet is to activate it through KMD lite wallet.)

[telegram] <Hermes08> Currently an encryption method for accessing the file as you describe is not currently available...users use their own way for encrypting their files ...we will start getting this requests to our devs thanks for the feedback. (re @douglaspelo: Is there any method to encrypt the wallet.dat using Linux CLI commands yet? It's disabled. Then with Agama using a GUI, we can use a PIN file + Password. So is there something similar using CLI commands?)

[03-Oct-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Please send us a support ticket at support@komodoplatform.com send us if you can the screenshots..also OS version ...we will get back to you shortly.

Very disappointed that @ShapeShift_io is implementing KYC. 

Just goes to show that any centralized entity will be pushed in that direction, which is why LN, atomic swaps and Decentralized Exchanges are the only way to resist surveillance economics.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Predecessor  to Komodo .  All the tech that Komodo has originated there. (re @pumba2988: What is SuperNet?)

[telegram] <pumba2988> Okay so if komodo owns agama why don't they update the new wallet to the komodo website or they will when it isn't in beta test

[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> You have to back up your agama wallet how do you do that

[04-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Agama is open source .  If Komodo team feels it's ready it will be on the site,  otherwise you goto the GitHub where you can get the latest version before they are linked on the Komodo site (re @pumba2988: Okay so if komodo owns agama why don't they update the new wallet to the komodo website or they will when it isn't in beta test)

[telegram] <Andreeees> Can there occur any problem if I do not watch my kmd in agama for 6 months ?

[04-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andreeees> Are thos updates necessary

[04-Oct-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Your funds are not in the wallet . The wallet access the block chain and you get to see the funds because you have the private keys or seed for an specific address . (re @Andreeees: Can there occur any problem if I do not watch my kmd in agama for 6 months ?)

[04-Oct-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> New updates are always good and in some cases mandatory so when you want to use it again just make sure to update it if necessary , also remember that if you have rewards to claim you need to do it at least once a month .
