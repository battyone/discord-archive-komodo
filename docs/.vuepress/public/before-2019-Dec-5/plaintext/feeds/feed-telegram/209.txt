maybe somebody can help me. Until now I secured my KMD with a Ledger Nano S. Due to the staking rewards I created today a Magnum Web Wallet and linked it with my Ledger.
The problem I have is that I reslized I am not able to send KMD. Everytime after I confirm the transaction on the Ledger, I receive following error message:
{ "error": {}, "data": "16: bad-txns-in-belowout. Code:-26" }
A friend send me some KMD for testing to my adress and it arrived. But it seems that my funds are frozen and I cannot move them.
Thanks in advance!
