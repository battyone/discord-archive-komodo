[18-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> You can then add coin btc (and maaany others)

[18-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> how do i enable advanced settings? i see quick access

[18-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> First create new wallet for kmd lite mode for example

[18-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> I understand you're beginning with a fresh, new agama

[18-Feb-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Once you have your kmd wallet use your seed to login

[18-Feb-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Then you'll find aforementioned settings

[18-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> after i signed in with my seed, i see settings, but there's no button to enable advanced settings

[18-Feb-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> oh nevermind. its settings - app config - enable adv settings

[18-Feb-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> actually btc doesnt show up.

[18-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> oh isee, i forgot to save the settings

[18-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> all is good. thx

[18-Feb-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Even after you save the settings, I think you also have to log off then log back in. Or simply close it then launch it again to take effect.

Can developers build Dapps on

[18-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Feb-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Transaction speed is a misnomer, when people talk about TPS they are referring to capacity.  Speed to regulated in all internet based to network propagation.  Capacity is how much can be processed without slowing things down.  But yes, due to multi chain architecture increasing capacity based on needs is more or less trivial (re @dsteve26: Transaction speed ?)

[telegram] <kkekoa> I saw a couple of veriblock inquiries above but no replies yet.  Is veriblock a competitor?  How does their 51% protection compare to Komodo?  How does Komodo's protection impact the BTC chain?  For veriblock, supposedly more than 30% of the BTC chain traffic is from them.  Does this mean they have a lot of customers or their stuff is just chatty?
