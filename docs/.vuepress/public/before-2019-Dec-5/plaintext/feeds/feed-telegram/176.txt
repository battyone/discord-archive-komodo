[telegram] <Regnar> When you're inputting a seed, its different than a private key. It can be converted, but having seed words is easier to remember and spot errors. But this also means you can make a private key from a single word (would be insanely unsafe) but it also means that if you add another letter, remove a space, add a space, or change any of the inputs (the seed) it will be a different address. Different seed = different address. (re @Kpprabhu: Is the private key not fixed length ?)

[telegram] <Rubinho> Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant. Komodo dragons' group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of Timor deer, though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.[5] Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans.[9]
Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About 20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole.[5] The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take 8 to 9 years to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.[5]

We didn't try to copy paste the book on zcash, or go too much into dPoW.
