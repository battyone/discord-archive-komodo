[30-May-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Now its dowmnloading like a 60 GB wallet and zcash something and all I did was reisnstall the agama 64bit from komodo site

[30-May-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Then you are using desktop version and using "native" which downloads a lot of data.

[30-May-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> There is no seed for that one. If you are using desktop version use "Lite" not "Native"

[30-May-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You stated earlier that you were on your phone. Are you using the phone or desktop?

[30-May-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> No

[30-May-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Are you using the phone or desktop?

[30-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Click on Restore Wallet

[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Gets me to my pin and cant get in

[30-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Due to name of wallet

[30-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay just relax a second man, you have your seed phrase correct? The 12 or 24 words that you were shown when you created your wallet. Those give you access no matter the wallet you use, desktop or mobile.
If you are on desktop, open "Lite" mode and use the restore wallet button, it will ask you for your seed, make sure you put it in perfectly. Itll then ask you to name the wallet and give it a password. 
Native mode doesn't use seeds, it downloads the whole blockchain which will take a long time.
Mobile will also ask you for your seed. I'm not up to date on the agama bugs right now, if there is a grey screen bug, but if you have your seed, you have your funds. (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: I enter my pass after the qr code and I dont think I named it and i cant get in can anyione help)

[30-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You have your seed right? (re @CRYPTOCHAOS: Due to name of wallet)

[30-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Tried both cant get in get adress , after entering seed

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> "Cant get in" what do you mean? Is the address different?

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Says name wallet then password and comfirm

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes.

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CRYPTOCHAOS> Wont let me past that dont know name ?
