We have new Agama build v41 https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
This new version release changelog:

* Fixed settings save bug that got socket timeout param broken
* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io
* ZILLA coin added.
* Fixes the recent SPV connectivity issues

Direct Links:
Linux: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-installer.zip
macOS: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-osx-installer.zip
Windows: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-windows-installer.zip
Linux Portable: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-portable.zip

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

This can be done by reset settings from settings. If resetting does not work, please remove the `config.json` file manually.

Data to be deleted: 
Please don't delete the whole `Agama` data directory as the dir contains your encrypted seeds
* Ubuntu: Delete `~/.agama/config.json 
* MacOS: Delete `config.json` file from ~/Library/Application\ Support/Agama dir
* Windows: Delete `config.json` file from C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Agama\ dir

When you change an entry in the `Settings` and save it, for it to take effect: 

* Click `Complete Logout` from the Top Menu
* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.

(re @OriginalBitcoin: @benohanlon @Audok I‚Äôve been pushing to get Komodo listed on CoinEx since the beginning but yet no one from the development team seems to listen or has reached out.  Yesterday, CoinEx, the original BCH exchange surpassed even binance in terms of trading volume.  Maybe now komodians will take notice.  Applying to get listed is free, so I‚Äôm still scratching my head as to why the Komodo community hasn‚Äôt taken advantage of this.)
