exactly.

[24-Jun-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this is the first viable candidate to use for a nationwide crypto

[24-Jun-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
all the other proposed solutions I see are either insecure or unproven or dont exist

[24-Jun-18 01:44 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
this is so much superior to ethereum proposed sharding

[24-Jun-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is much simpler and simpler is much better, yes

[24-Jun-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it also costs much less per tx, a lot less

[24-Jun-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it ends up being as secure as BTC

[24-Jun-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
sort of a magic trick

[24-Jun-18 01:48 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
yeah in every way. more secure, faster, scalable, etx

[24-Jun-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is just one usecase of our contracts tech, we continue to create useful solutions while most other projects have some sort of pie in the sky whitepaper, many describing what we already have

[24-Jun-18 01:50 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
very true. meanwhile you are getting about 5X the current avg tx speed of Visa, and roughly 50X that of PayPal

[24-Jun-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
tx or payments?

[24-Jun-18 01:51 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
TX per second

[24-Jun-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
one tx can have 1 payment or 100+

[24-Jun-18 01:52 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
visa avg about 1600 i think

[24-Jun-18 01:52 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
oh right! lol

[24-Jun-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
at 100 payments tx, you lose 90% of tx/sec, but gain 100x on payments so a 10x increase in payments / sec

[24-Jun-18 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
10,000 tx/sec of 1 pay -> 1000 tx/sec of 100 pay = 100,000 payments per second. that is with "only" 64 chains

[24-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
ah. need to confirm the numbers on others...but for example i think ether is 20 or so, maybe that’s old info

[24-Jun-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the point for single blockchain throughputs when we can spawn an arbitrary number

[24-Jun-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to push all car traffic onto a single road. not even govts are that silly. if more road capacity is needed, you just build more roads

[24-Jun-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and we dont need some magical maglev vacuum sealed hypersonic roadway. just an old fashioned asphalt road suffices

[24-Jun-18 01:59 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
haha yes

[24-Jun-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever capacity  the hypersonic maglev road can achieve, N asphalt roads will get much better overall traffic throughput

[24-Jun-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and be much less expensive

[24-Jun-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only one complex/clever part about our scaling and that is the MoMoM, 99% is just bruteforce replication of working blockchain tech.

[24-Jun-18 02:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think train track example again suites here instead of roads 😄

[24-Jun-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
granted, being able to spawn a chain from the command line is pretty cool and what makes it possible to automate

[24-Jun-18 02:01 PM] yorklab#7270
If there is no limit (or if it's crazy high), then Komodo should advertise as such. State the actual tested then state what's theoretically possible, because the tested number proves the theory.

[24-Jun-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the only limit is the number of blockchains the internet can support

[24-Jun-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
more chains, more capacity. and we are seeing a linear scaling of capacity per chain, now the bottlenecks have been fied

[24-Jun-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed

[24-Jun-18 02:04 PM] yorklab#7270
Then Komodo's scaling capability is unlimited. Never heard anybody else state this before, much less prove it.

[24-Jun-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is limited by the internet's capacity

[24-Jun-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Oliver Westbrook  If you have any questions for me about the tests design let me know. Its incredibly simple in its function. As james said we just automated a system that allows for spawning unlimited chains and then filling all of their mempools with TX at the same time.

[24-Jun-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
while it is being notarized

[24-Jun-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[24-Jun-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and that also allows the burn protocol to be done at the same time

[24-Jun-18 02:06 PM] yorklab#7270
Speaking only of Komodo's capability.

[24-Jun-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is needed to create the proofs

[24-Jun-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW must go to KMD chain

[24-Jun-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
its only a few hundred KMD per year per chain, so it wont be that much of an effect, until we get 10,000+ chains notarizing

[24-Jun-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but considerng that 10,000 chains can be spawned automatically it is just a matter of having the funding to launch a single cluster of 10,000 chains

[24-Jun-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
on a separate topic I added: fill or kill, immediate or cancel and good till canceled modes for barterDEX trades, from the alice side. bob automatically makes custom sized utxo for alice so alice just needs to have the utxo for the purchase and the dexfee. it also autosplits if there is only one utxo

[24-Jun-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
until these improvements it was running in a hybrid (and silly) config of immediate or cancel for alice but bob was treating it as a fill or kill

[24-Jun-18 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so i think ordermatching will be 10x better now
