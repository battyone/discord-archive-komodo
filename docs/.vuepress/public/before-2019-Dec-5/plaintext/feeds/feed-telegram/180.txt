[28-Nov-18 10:09 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes you can...if you wish but you could also send the funds to a newly created address in Agama it depends on you...if you are using ledger and want to keep your private keys secure you can create a new address in Agama via Lite mode and use it from there.  Here is a guide on how to do this  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024492-create-new-wallet-and-encrypt-seed-spv-/en

[telegram] <Hermes08> For now we stopped giving the tutorial on how to this with Agama because some users complained that they risk of exposing their ledger private keys by doing so...so what we recommend for users for now is wait for ledger to make this update.

The other way around is to create a new seed with Agama as showed in the previous guide and send your KMD to this new address and then send it back to your ledger when you finish claiming the reward.
