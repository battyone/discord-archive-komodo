[telegram] <Craig> If we are throwing out random dexes there's also stakenet now in beta.
Just lightning swaps, which seems very limited.
But from the UI angle it's worth a look IMHO. You'd have to find the video on YouTube uploaded by user mirror Annon, video called stakenet early dex beta preview.

[telegram] <klimenko85> What is the frequency of payments to holders? Is this already happening or in the plans? (re @Acura360: DEX receives 50% of all dex fees which are using AtomicDEX API. The current holdings of all dex fees can be seen by visiting 
This shows all the dex fees collected for every coin. Before payout, these will be traded for KMD and then distributed according to the revenue sharing model. This is the distribution of the dex fees:
50% ‚Äì DEX
15% ‚Äì JUMBLR
15% ‚Äì BOTS
5% ‚Äì REVS
5% ‚Äì MGW
10% ‚Äì Claimed by the GUI developer)
