[26-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> AtomicDex is great for showcasing the things that are possible with Komodo. I agree with you that it's only the beginning. We must be looking for adoption in large scale and Antara makes so many use cases possible... It's crazy how little known komodo's possibilities are right now. I think we need more products like AtomicDex for showing to the world the possibilities. Once they are recognized, sky is the limit for adoption, growth and development based on Komodo. For this we need more projects building on it, recognition by the devs. (re @Ggokhangark: Atomicdex is a great unique project and it will help to kmd platfrom very much but I like antara project more than atomic dex. there are thousands of companies who wants to create their own blockchain to use in their business or in life.

Kmd team will lead the way and showcase how different use cases can be done be it then dicos, sto's, oracles, blockchain usage in games, whatever. Possibilities are huge. Once couple of products like AtomicDex are shown to world why would'nt devs want to build on komodo...

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Let's say something like chainlink that is very hot right now. (Btw personally I think the use case is very good but the whole thing is partly based on assumption that ethereum and projects / defi based on it will succeed also in future. Which to me is quite an assumption. Plus  quite bad tokenomics, still erc-20, evidence on organized pumps n dumps on it and so on.) Whatever back to my point which is once you get recognition the markets will react, in this case wildly. Now what is interesting to me is how hard it would be to develop such project based on Komodo? Certainly Komodo / Antara provides better tools for developing a project for such use case than ethereum...? Or gaming projects, would'nt Komodo be optimal platform to build projects? And so on.. Also the benefits like organising decentralised ico and get your project straight away to trade on AtomicDex... Very nice for starting a project. I think the key is to get the word out and by this way get devs to build real stuff with komodo. They just need to be made aware of the possibilities.
