1. already half a dozen external projects have dPoW and over 500 coins integrated into barterDEX. it seems this is well underway
2. agreed and we have projects in the works to solve this
3. the pegs CC will utilize KMD as backing to create stablecoins, but in general I prefer to just expand the ecosystem and KMD benefits indirectly. Artificially constraining supply, is pretty artificial and charging fees in KMD just because we can will slow down adoption.
4. the design of CC is such that each one creates its own set of rpc calls, so just by calling various rpc calls (in any language) you can create a dapp, this is much easier than even writing interpreted smart contracts
5. LN could work with blockchain protocol that doesnt have txid malleability, but they made it also require segwit. KMD will never have segwit. That being said channels CC solves the latency issue for payments and creates a hubless (no centralization) payment channels
6. as you say we are working with projects to integrate in all directions, gaming included
7. last time i checked, we have no way to force the community to do anything, but of course any community help is appreciated

thanks for your article, it seems most is covered but always we can use more help in the areas that we are not full covered in

[telegram] <Sam> Thank you for those kind words. We are doing this for like 7 weeks, and we had many lessons learned. A proper demo is planned for June 29th, so we were only going for a WIP.  A much more planned stream is set up for the Komodo Pioneers event. I understand that you prefer a super professional setup of everything and that we have all bases covered at step one. Sadly we are only humans who try the very best we can, work long hours and solve obstacles by crossing bridges when we face them. Writing articles is definitely a step in the right direction in our opinion, we are in no sense pushing people to believe what we do or forcing anyone to adopt our mindset. I hope you will feel better in the future about our work and appreciate the super amount of effort we put in this project that came into existance just weeks ago. We know that you would've organized this 1000x better, presented it a million times more professional. We did what we could do with limited resources and little time. We got some good and positive feedback too. And we are always open to feedback. So I thank you for your remark. (re @Ra: Is this some type of joke, when will you show a proper demo with full game play not this repetitive nonsense.btw your livestream was unorganized and a waste of time)

[telegram] <Ra> Well at least your not asking for investors money so you can do as you please. (re @Sam: Thank you for those kind words.

[telegram] <Ra> I also think if a game company acted the way you guys did and asked you for your investing cash you will promptly say No thanks

[28-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> We are actually backed by some people, and we do have an investing party for the games we develop. We are working on a whitepaper, and creating content such as those medium articles will make everything much more transparent and clear. (re @Ra: Well at least your not asking for investors money so you can do as you please.)

[telegram] <Sam> Based on that stream, you are entirely right. However, the people we work closely with know more about our work and velocity. I hope that in the upcoming week there will be a way better representation of what we do (we also had to find the right people to help us with that). I can promise you that our next live streams and youtube content will be way more professional. I invite you to visit us at The Hague Tech, in the Netherlands, so you know that there are a lot people working and learning on the way. We had a lot of obstacles that day (from streaming from two locations - a missing camera that became a solution of a phone with hangouts screen capture and finding a setting in chrome to get it displayed - a streaming setup that needed a better machine to process the gameplay, so OBS was set up the very, very last minute on my laptop - a playbook of things that was written out and then had to change to a freestyle - some game build bugs, like Linux build unable to display far plane media and a audio bug on Windows). We weren't also super sharp, as I haven't left the office for 3 days except for showers and a quick sandwich, Max worked his butt off to make overlays that at the end wouldn't scale well and the list goes on and on. A lot of people know I wasn't happy about how the stream worked out at all, but I got some very nice and supporting feedback too. We really do our best, and we were just having fun mere weeks ago, and now we are suddenly running a business where every week is just crazy. If you doubt us, we really don't mind. We got a lot to proof and put the tech where our mouth is. And we are in process of doing it.
