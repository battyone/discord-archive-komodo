@runpaint  your coin is on AtomicDEX now 🙂

[20-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Oszy#5734
is it just me or i can't see it in the coins file?

[20-Oct-19 01:34 PM] runpaint#7773
@t0sma thanks!

[20-Oct-19 01:48 PM] runpaint#7773
@Oszy did you download the new update?

[20-Oct-19 03:11 PM] Oszy#5734
No i was checking the official coins list file on github for mm2 cli

[20-Oct-19 03:17 PM] Oszy#5734
I see it in atomicdex :)

[20-Oct-19 03:18 PM] Oszy#5734
When can we see orders?

[20-Oct-19 07:20 PM] runpaint#7773
There are lots of orders now

[20-Oct-19 07:21 PM] runpaint#7773
@kmdkrazy - yes this is a very embarrassing typographical error in our announcement.  However, because of the decentralized nature of this project, we don't use checkpointing.  Therefore we must allow the typo to remain, just as it would on the blockchain.

[20-Oct-19 07:46 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok....wrong place for this post... but are you keeping your broken link too @runpaint ???

[20-Oct-19 07:47 PM] runpaint#7773
@kmdkrazy Commode.io was redirecting to the main site, then I was going to clone the mining pool at that url, but the mining pool isn't working.  I apologize for the inconvenience and personal trouble you've experienced

[20-Oct-19 07:49 PM] runpaint#7773
Was there any other broken link besides that one?  If not, please correct your statement from "broken links" to "broken link"

[20-Oct-19 07:59 PM] runpaint#7773
Thank you for the revision.  Our technical team is working to fix the link, and Komodo team is working to fix the pool.  The support from the community makes it all worthwhile

[20-Oct-19 09:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Good ...cause I just bought 99,999 coins

[20-Oct-19 09:35 PM] runpaint#7773
That's wonderful!  How much did you pay?

[24-Oct-19 08:17 AM] wolfgang#3508
Hello all - im trying to figure out if this is the right solution for me.

[24-Oct-19 08:18 AM] wolfgang#3508
Is the wallet available through antara mobile friendly?

[24-Oct-19 08:18 AM] wolfgang#3508
Basically want a token for a competition ill be running for a local community here.

[24-Oct-19 08:19 AM] wolfgang#3508
Dont know if using antara and kmd would be the way to go or just use RVN?

[24-Oct-19 08:19 AM] wolfgang#3508
tokens earnt through the comp will be ongoing like a currency for this community

@wolfgang what type of competition is it going to be? Also are the participants developer heavy or not really? This is to give me an idea of what is the best fit for you. Generally Antara is the simplest route and the best looking as you can get the wallet, explorers, etc with Antara. 

If your community is heavy developers they may be more interested in the nitty gritty parts of it, and you may want to explore the documentation for command line interface. However this wouldn't be a great route if you prefer everyone to be able to have their coins on mobile wallets.

[24-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Regnar#6164
If the coins are rewards for a competition, and it isn't something like a blockchain developer competition, I would suggest Antara. That will give you the coins, the wallets, the explorers, basically everything you need to provide coins as rewards and for your community to interact with them, hodl, send them, trade, check them out on explorers, the user friendly crypto experience.

@ca333 is definitely the go to here for walking you through Antara and making sure it is the right fit for you and your goals if you would prefer to discuss your plans in a less public channel.

[24-Oct-19 01:16 PM] ca333#0118
Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions @wolfgang - @Regnar just explained it perfectly. 
Antara lets you set up your blockchain/token, the entire minimal infrastructure to form a p2p network, blockchain explorer, SPV infrastructure, mining nodes, and much more just with a few clicks - however, it is not a pre-requirement to use Antara in order to build your chain on KMD and to get the mobile DEX wallet. Everything is pretty much very independent of each other on our platform.

@ca333 Commod chain has been stalled 45 minutes now. what is wrong?https://commod.explorer.dexstats.info/blocks

[05-Nov-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if its on demand chain, then simply lack of tx would make the blocks stop

[05-Nov-19 01:49 PM] Mark81#4505
ist mineable

[05-Nov-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
or not enough miners

[05-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Mark81#4505
Mining hashes has been same whole day but for some reason it just stopped to latest block

[05-Nov-19 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
there wasn't enough miners on COMMOD

[05-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Mark81#4505
its going on now...

[05-Nov-19 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007
hashrate on that pool doesn't seem to be accurate

[05-Nov-19 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007
i started mining few mins ago to get it moving

[05-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Mark81#4505
ok, thanks

[05-Nov-19 02:23 PM] ca333#0118
as pointed out by Shossain - the COMMOD network seems lacking miners @Mark81 (cc: @runpaint )

[05-Nov-19 02:27 PM] Mark81#4505
okay, my tx was stuck for a while and now its moving again. its just weird that pool shows steady hashes and still tx can get stuck. Is there pool upgrade for commod if its not working proberly? @runpaint

[05-Nov-19 02:41 PM] ca333#0118
the pool is working properly - only the hashrate stats are not 100% reliable/approp.

[05-Nov-19 02:55 PM] Mark81#4505
Over their ann someone complained lack of higher diff for asics?

[05-Nov-19 03:06 PM] runpaint#7773
Yeah I don't know why, I've had my ASICs and rentals on it nonstop.  Sometimes a block can take 10 times the target time to find, but 45 minutes seems extreme for 1-minute blocks

[05-Nov-19 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
could be difficulty spikes

[08-Nov-19 03:54 PM] Mark81#4505
commod chain is again stalled. almost an hour now.

[08-Nov-19 03:55 PM] Mark81#4505
net work is being attacked with high minig power to raise difficulty up.

[08-Nov-19 03:56 PM] Mark81#4505
Difficulty: 856821.2322978075

[09-Nov-19 07:20 AM] ciumete#3212
commod have no adaptive pow ?!

[09-Nov-19 09:39 AM] Mark81#4505
No just normal difficulty adjustment. I think aPow would be necessary especially for atomicdex to operate flawlessly with DEX swaps for assetchains.

[09-Nov-19 01:59 PM] ciumete#3212
can't make swaps if blockchain is stuck !

[09-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Oszy#5734
well that's up to the Commod team to think about inmplementing

[09-Nov-19 04:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They should rent a mining node in antara tbh

[09-Nov-19 04:57 PM] Oszy#5734
he has a few asic constantly running, but if someone comes and deliberately raises the diff with nicehash and leave, you cant do much with a couple asics

[09-Nov-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
adaptivepow was made for such cases

[10-Nov-19 07:00 AM] Mark81#4505
Atomic swaps won't happen with these conditions.

[10-Nov-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the pools for commod are not configured right

[10-Nov-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
adaptivepow is recommended for coins without a large number of miners and pools

[10-Nov-19 08:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Can they switch to adaptive pow without hardforking chain?

[10-Nov-19 08:49 AM] Mark81#4505
If i am right commod chain bought through antara framework and is in that sence boot uped by komodo devs.

[10-Nov-19 08:50 AM] gcharang#6833
> Can they switch to adaptive pow without hardforking chain?
no, it is a hardforking change

[10-Nov-19 08:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
antara framework is the initializer. and yes komodo team indeed has built it and made it easy, for SMEs to get started with komodo tech to start their own independent blockchain with much less efforts than being a developer, it does not mean it is booted by or started by the komodo devs.
it's the system.
system is created and setup by the komodo devs.
now it's the system who takes care of all things automatically.
and since the system also gives the params to all people who wants to connect to this independent blockchain to make transactions over a fully synchronised network client, it becomes distributed, being spread over multiple nodes than just the initial nodes which started this independent blockchain at the first place.

[10-Nov-19 08:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess since it's all the core basics of Network Topologies, could be confusing to non-IT people, but in a Decentralised/Distributed Network there is no central point of failure.

[10-Nov-19 08:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Neither any central point of control.

[10-Nov-19 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ah... guess I replied without understanding full context 😅

[10-Nov-19 08:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gcharan covered it in short and to the point 😄

[10-Nov-19 04:57 PM] Mark81#4505
i am thinking reason for this difficulty spikes to commod. what if this reason is to get network diff to high and after that stall rest of network. And then mine secretly blocks and not publish it? If done succesfully even one day it could cause huge mining rewards?

[10-Nov-19 04:59 PM] Mark81#4505
is there limit to how many blocks can be mined before added to last notarization?

[10-Nov-19 05:00 PM] ciumete#3212
from about 7 hours no activity on commod blockchain...

[10-Nov-19 05:01 PM] Mark81#4505
#28669 is the last block that is mined on official pool.

[10-Nov-19 05:02 PM] ciumete#3212
what is the address of blockchain explorer ?

[10-Nov-19 05:02 PM] ciumete#3212

[10-Nov-19 05:05 PM] Mark81#4505
they are empty since network is stalled but you can search that blocknumber

[10-Nov-19 05:05 PM] ciumete#3212
it was stalled last days but shows at what block left, now is different result !

[10-Nov-19 05:08 PM] ciumete#3212
interesting on commod pool are some miners !!! they receive the rewards ?!

[10-Nov-19 05:09 PM] Mark81#4505
if there is happening background mining and blocks are not published then even pool miners are screwed. hostile mining is so far by now that every reward will be vanishing.

[10-Nov-19 05:09 PM] Mark81#4505
there has been some reason why network was attacked in first place.

[10-Nov-19 05:10 PM] Mark81#4505
i guess its time to get  some mining power to pool since if it gets moving and is published then notary nodes will permanently write it to kmd and hostile mining cant erase that.

[10-Nov-19 05:11 PM] ciumete#3212
how it was attacked ?! have no dpow and apow features enabled ?!

[10-Nov-19 05:11 PM] Mark81#4505
dpow is enabled

[10-Nov-19 05:11 PM] Mark81#4505
its such my speculation that something is mined in background

[10-Nov-19 05:11 PM] ciumete#3212
interesting...

[10-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Mark81#4505
but once it has few block mined it will be notarized and possible mining without publishing blocks will be useless.

[10-Nov-19 05:15 PM] ciumete#3212
btw, will be created commod channel to inform people what happening , if is, or will be some hardfork, etc ?

[10-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Mark81#4505
Can someone take a look this commod pool? https://pool.kmd.dev/stats

Mark81, try using the low difficulty port

[10-Nov-19 06:47 PM] Mark81#4505
it is ported to 3777 which is low.

[10-Nov-19 06:47 PM] runpaint#7773
I'll ask ca333 who is in complete control of the pool

[10-Nov-19 06:48 PM] Mark81#4505
yes that i am hoping too because its run by antara framework.  @Oszy
