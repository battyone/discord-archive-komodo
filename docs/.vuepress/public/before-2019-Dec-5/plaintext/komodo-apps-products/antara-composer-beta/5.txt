[12-Jul-19 02:27 PM] TonyL#3577

I don't have 18.10

[12-Jul-19 02:31 PM] naezith#9757
is your firefox updated

[12-Jul-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
yes `68.0 (64-bit) ` it's latest release (released just July 9)

[12-Jul-19 02:33 PM] TonyL#3577
but it worked before update same way - there are deps interconnected with firefox (gnome partially lets say as I understand) - maybe it's really deps issue

[12-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Mylo#8306
if.... you're using `display: flexbox;` in css, firefox doesn't play well with flexbox.   `display: block` will work better, but this will make something small change in chrome - which can be fixed by another minor edit, then it all works fine. 
else....ignore if you're not using flexbox

[13-Jul-19 06:14 AM] naezith#9757
no flexbox but this. 

```
display: flex !important; 
justify-content: center !important; 
align-items: center !important;
``` @Mylo

[13-Jul-19 06:15 AM] Mylo#8306
yes that's the one, let me search discord for previous suggestion to flex problem with firefox.

[13-Jul-19 06:18 AM] Mylo#8306
`display: block;` and it will break 2 very small things in chrome which are easy to fix with chrome dev tools for that section.

hey guys, reading back, I'll help with the missing text in a second.

@Daniel CP you have to delete some item on checkout page by red bin button and then press "add more tools to your blockchain"

Imo we can just make all elements on this cart page with +- (some thigs as an AtomicDEX listing for example just +- from 0 to 1) and deprecate this additional page at all

[15-Jul-19 10:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020

site will be down/unstable for a while

[15-Jul-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
should it be considered as `the system is ready to go ` and ready for final test?

[15-Jul-19 11:40 AM] TS#7923
team, can you help me qith two things, please?

[15-Jul-19 11:40 AM] TS#7923
1. What is "Public dashboard", what do we offer exactly?

[15-Jul-19 11:40 AM] TS#7923

[15-Jul-19 11:40 AM] TS#7923
if this is not ready we should take this out

[15-Jul-19 11:41 AM] TS#7923
2. What is the difference between AtomicDEX listing and AtomicDEX mobile wallet listing? I guess nothing at this point so we should just keep AtomicDEX listing for now

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/585490205751115777/600290841101074432/unknown.png

[15-Jul-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Public dashboard is the page with infomration about blockchain (same blockchain info page as user can see inside of composer but detached and without chain deletion feature)

[15-Jul-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`2. What is the difference between AtomicDEX listing and AtomicDEX mobile wallet listing? I guess nothing at this point so we should just keep AtomicDEX listing for now` 
I wonder just AtomicDEX listing supposes steps to make coin compatible with mm2 protocol (coin params/electrums pr to coins repo for example), but it's better to confirm with @ca333 
On this stage this option is a stub I think.

[15-Jul-19 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
As a hot fix maybe make options which do nothing atm grey/inactive with "coming soon" in text?

[15-Jul-19 11:54 AM] ca333#0118
atomicdex mobile listing is the listing into the mobile dex app

atomicdex listing is adding the coin and logo to coins list of supported coins on atomicdex repo and running a swap test

[15-Jul-19 12:00 PM] TS#7923
@TonyL is this public dashboard live / ready? Can you show me an example?

[15-Jul-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's ready. Unfortunately I can't show example right now because a) website migrating b) all my blockchains were deleted

[15-Jul-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
let me try to find some screenshot

[15-Jul-19 12:01 PM] TS#7923
@ca333 I think we should join the two options for now while we are still in beta, what do you think? I can mention both in the copy.

[15-Jul-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
So dashboard in general is the page like this: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/585490205751115777/596129777241554945/unknown.png?width=1391&height=597

do the same things on that repo right?

[15-Jul-19 02:53 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
MM2 development is unrelated to iguana for long time, MM2 changes should not be repeated on main iguana repo.

[15-Jul-19 03:06 PM] ca333#0118
its irrelevant @naezith - fork supernet from jl777/supernet to chainlizard/supernet and do the modifications there. as aforementioned these will be merged to jl777/supernet after a manual review.
