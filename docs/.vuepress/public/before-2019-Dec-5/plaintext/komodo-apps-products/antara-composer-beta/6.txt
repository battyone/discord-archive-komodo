payment for another chain in DOGE was quite fast, for KMD payment waiting for a one hour already - seems KMD not working on coinpayments side at the moment

[15-Jul-19 05:51 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Could you please contact coinpayments? It looks like KMD payments not working from their side at the moment (most probably it's hardfork related because just 2 days ago I paid fine).

Example of problem payment (I paid full sum to provided adress but payment status never changed, with DOGE payment was smooth):

so we have to rise prices or remove these currencies

[15-Jul-19 07:16 PM] ca333#0118
this^ is irrelevant @TonyL - it is basically "dust-tx" prevention. Once we update to real prices they will be above the minimum..

I think there is no more critical issues at the moment ( at least detected ones üòÉ ) so with higher prices and temporary disabled KMD as a payment method we can show composer to wider auditory @ca333

in order to activate a specific CCs you can do this with -ac_ccenable=nn, nn, nn...

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[17-Jul-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the CC are built in and that would work, for the ones like dilithium that are in a libcc, you need to link in that libcc, or maybe there are just a few prebuilt komodod with each libcc

[17-Jul-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0118
yes - we will add CC (Antara modules) next together with dynamic timeframes (3 - N months) for the chain-subscriptions.

[17-Jul-19 01:58 PM] naezith#9757
composer does not use `ac_ccenable` for now

[17-Jul-19 01:58 PM] naezith#9757
only `ac_cc`

[17-Jul-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
that would enable them all, which is ok too, if that is what the customer wants

my saved chain from earlier in the day is not in "My blockchains" list, i didn't pay of it.  but the ticker is still unavailable & i can't access my saved template

[18-Jul-19 08:31 AM] Mylo#8306
found it in my cart, sorry for the bother

[20-Jul-19 07:26 AM] gcharang#6833
I am not sure if it is intentional, but the clusters section doesn't indicate that it enables Antara modules.

Is it possible to change the section name to "Antara Modules"
and add the options N=0 and N=1 too ? (for the cases: disable antara modules and enable antara modules but disable crosschain stuff)

Also the description of "Non-fungible" case should have: "less than 100"
and "fungible" case should have: "greater than 99"

did these two changes:
- change CLUSTERS  to ANTARA MODULES
- description of "Non-fungible" case should have: "less than 100"  "fungible" case should have: "greater than 99"

[20-Jul-19 11:11 AM] naezith#9757
we don't have any special rule for N=0 and N=1 @gcharang

[20-Jul-19 11:12 AM] naezith#9757
I mean you can set it to 0 and 1

[20-Jul-19 11:15 AM] naezith#9757
anything else?

[20-Jul-19 01:57 PM] Alright#0419
if the chain is meant to be fungible with others, it requires dpow and the number must be reserved

[20-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Alright#0419
so like if one customer makes ac_cc=312 chain, no other chains can use 312 unless that customer allows it

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[20-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Alright#0419
0 should not be a valid value btw, that is the equivalent of not setting ac_cc at all

[22-Jul-19 04:05 PM] gcharang#6833
@naezith 

my suggestion is:

```
Section name: Antara modules

Show 3 options
- Antara modules disabled ---> don't include  "-ac_cc" in the chain params at all
- Antara modules enabled but no crosschain validation ---> "-ac_cc=1" (a chain that doesn't want to scale at all)
- Antara modules enabled and crosschain validation is also enabled.
  |   If this case is selected, then show these two sub options
  | - non-fungible case ---> "-ac_cc=N" N >= 2 and <= 99 (chains that can interact with other chains to create some complex logic like fitbit tokens transfering to a insurance chain to activate an Antara module)
  | - fungible case ---> "-ac_cc=N" N >= 100 (chains that can scale and increase their txn/sec)
```
@Alright can you confirm the above description is correct?

[22-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
it's correct

[22-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
nothing really uses momom over than burn protocol right now, so 2-99 is just future proofing

[22-Jul-19 04:12 PM] naezith#9757
okay I can do the changes, do you approve @ca333 ?

@gcharang @naezith maybe mention this requires dpow

[22-Jul-19 04:16 PM] naezith#9757
current system does not check if dpow is in same cart

[22-Jul-19 04:16 PM] naezith#9757
since dpow is added after all these stuff are selected

[22-Jul-19 04:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@naezith if the third option 
```
Antara modules enabled and crosschain validation is also enabled.
```
is selected, mention there that subscribing to dPoW is mandatory in the selection screen

Later in the cart, if the user tries to go to the Payment screen without adding dPoW, throw an error saying "either select dPoW or go back to change the Antara module to the `-ac_cc=1` case"?

[22-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
it's a weird situation because nothing actually uses momom right now other than burn protocol

[22-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Alright#0419
a default value of ac_cc=2 would work for 99% of people

[22-Jul-19 04:33 PM] Alright#0419
practically, there is no difference between ac_cc=1 and ac_cc=2 right now

[22-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Alright#0419
the reserving any ac_cc value >99 is vitally important btw

[22-Jul-19 04:34 PM] Alright#0419
so if you can't do that right now, wouldn't support >99 for now

[22-Jul-19 04:36 PM] Alright#0419
Let's say Alice makes new coin with ac_cc=101, if Bob can create another ac_cc=101 chain and have it added to the same dpow network, Bob can make millions of coins on his chain and import them to Alice's
