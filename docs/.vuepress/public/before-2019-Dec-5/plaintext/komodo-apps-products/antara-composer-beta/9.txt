I added COMMOD on my pool unimining.net in case you need another pool @Mark81

I'll add the icon of the coin and I'll fine tune numbers (difficulty, TTF, profit)

[12-Nov-19 12:58 AM] Mark81#4505
Thanks @phm87 !

[12-Nov-19 12:58 AM] phm87#7395
you're welcome

[12-Nov-19 12:59 AM] phm87#7395
as I think that you have the whole network, maybe you can reduce hashrate used to lower difficulty and lower the cost of mining

[12-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Mark81#4505
Rented so i really cant.

[12-Nov-19 01:02 AM] Mark81#4505
Or i need to point some of hashrate else where. Its getting late here so i need to get some sleep. I will sleep better now.

[12-Nov-19 01:03 AM] phm87#7395
it is 2 am here and I can't set another pool. Tomorrow, I'll compare hash of last block of COMMOD on my notary node and my pool

[12-Nov-19 01:03 AM] phm87#7395
and I hope that the other pool will be fixed tomorrow

[12-Nov-19 01:04 AM] phm87#7395
Blockhash of blocks found on the pool are displayed here : <https://unimining.net/site/block?id=3097>

[12-Nov-19 01:06 AM] Mark81#4505
Thank you again!  Have nice sleep you too!

[12-Nov-19 01:08 AM] phm87#7395
No problem. Have a nice sleep

Antara commod explorer which is hosted by Amazon AWS is down. http://34.251.151.148 @ca333

[20-Nov-19 10:40 AM] phm87#7395
Hopefully the unofficial dexstats explorer of commod works fine: https://commod.explorer.dexstats.info

it works fine its just that if antara is PAID service it shoud be working all time

[20-Nov-19 10:43 AM] Mark81#4505
So far there has been problems with official pool and now with explorer.

[20-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Mark81#4505
if projects gets launched with antara more who will be checking all time that everything is fine and working.

[20-Nov-19 10:44 AM] Mark81#4505
explorer been down already at least four days.

[20-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
who is running the pool?

[20-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the main problems was spikes in diff and hashrate? Dont really see why that is a problem of antara team/kmd, more like a problem for the project itself?

[20-Nov-19 10:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
they can rent mining nodes as well if needed

[20-Nov-19 10:57 AM] phm87#7395
@Mark81 I have automated checks for my pool and some explorers, it requires adaptations for knomp and kmd ecosystem explorers. Yiimp pools have automated checks out of the box (email sent if payments fail), I don t know for knomp

[20-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Mark81#4505
runpaint has contacted ca333 always in case for pool problems

[20-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Mark81#4505
if you buy service do you run them by itself?

[20-Nov-19 11:00 AM] Mark81#4505
buy new car and you do pay maintance services to dealer and do services by your self?

[20-Nov-19 11:02 AM] Mark81#4505
if antara is hosted service then things need to run without need to worry those by buyer.

[20-Nov-19 11:03 AM] Mark81#4505
I know its new  thing still and things will get better over time.

[20-Nov-19 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Antara provides a toolkit. It also offers the services to run everything such as mining nodes etc. If you dont pay for mining nodes should you still get them because they are offered as an option?

[20-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont expect my bmw to have laserlights if I didnt pay for them even if they are offered

[20-Nov-19 11:14 AM] phm87#7395
@Cryptoon I think that they paid for the official pool. But I have no clues what are root causes of problems that occured

[20-Nov-19 11:44 AM] ca333#0118
@Mark81 what exactly are you trying to say?

i) the explorer is NOT down - https://composer.kmd.io/c/COMMOD clearly lists http://34.247.161.246/ as the explorer. Please do NOT spread false informations/FUD ref. Antara Composer.

ii) the pool for commod is a service i am running personally for runpaint for FREE and not being paid for it. it was meant as a favor. In addition we provided him pool sources/repos so he can set up an official pool.

@phm87 Not sure where you are pulling `I think that they paid for the official pool.` from?

[20-Nov-19 11:47 AM] phm87#7395
@ca333 I misunderstood some infos in the discussion here above. I owe you an appology, I did not know you were running this pool for free. Sorry for the wrong thinking

[20-Nov-19 11:51 AM] phm87#7395
Note: I was not paid to add commod on my pool. I did it to help guys

[20-Nov-19 11:51 AM] ca333#0118
No problem. Rest all assured that Antara Composer is a great and reliable service. It is fully automated and there is 0 downtime. The underlying infrastructure shows 100% uptime for all servers/p2p-nodes related to  https://composer.kmd.io/c/COMMOD - Composer uses the AWS API for the key operations. For the dpow'd chain networks itself we ensure there are at least 60 additional & independent p2p nodes available to form a truly decentralized network.

My thinking is from commod ANN site (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5194266.0) were links to ip http://34.251.151.148 are shown as explorer and when i checked that ip its "Amazon Data Services Ireland Limited" so if that is not part of Composer services then my apoligies to @ca333

its actually very well informed site!

[20-Nov-19 12:41 PM] Mark81#4505
i will provide these links to runpaint so he can update ann site accordingly.

[20-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Mark81#4505
Links are now updated to ANN site.

[20-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Mark81#4505
after talking to runpaint he told that links on ann were provide by Komodo team so is it possible that amazon changed explorer address?

[20-Nov-19 12:56 PM] Mark81#4505
@ca333

[20-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Mark81#4505
Well it turns out that Explorer address for composer is indeed changed by Amazon since even atomicdex wallet hardcoded Ip address is not working for commod coin explorer as its refers also to old address http://34.251.151.148/. @ca333

[20-Nov-19 01:34 PM] ca333#0118
@naezith ^ why did explorer IP change?

[20-Nov-19 01:41 PM] ca333#0118
ok i guess i know it just by logic - client bought explorer on monthly subscription - then did not pay/upgrade next month and had to buy the service again after expiration. In this case you get a new explorer server. Pretty sure this happened.

[20-Nov-19 01:42 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
plausible

[20-Nov-19 01:48 PM] naezith#9757
exactly

[20-Nov-19 02:24 PM] ca333#0118

[20-Nov-19 03:01 PM] Mark81#4505
Now that atomicdex commod explorer has wrong ip address does it affect somehow to commod trading on DEX?

[20-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Oszy#5734
no that is trough spv

[20-Nov-19 03:21 PM] Mark81#4505
How about transaction confirmations? also through spv?

[20-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Oszy#5734
yes, spv runs a full node

[20-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Oszy#5734
explorer is just GUI for the blockchain

[20-Nov-19 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
did spv server change ipaddr too?

[20-Nov-19 04:19 PM] Oszy#5734
not that i know of, i had COMMOD trade today in atomicdex, and mobile wallet is running fine too.

[20-Nov-19 06:48 PM] ca333#0118
no - the SPV didn't "expire" as we re using it for multiple chains so even if its being removed its just temporary and until the service is paid again which triggers the deployment

[25-Nov-19 11:27 PM] Regnar#6164
@ca333 is there a directory page that shows coins like you see at <https://composer.kmd.io/c/COMMOD>

[02-Dec-19 08:49 AM] zenosama#5371
i wonder would it be possible to create a smart chain soft cap ico ;D

[02-Dec-19 08:52 AM] zenosama#5371
as a matter of fact, the question would be how to

[02-Dec-19 09:12 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama you can create a smart chain with antara composer and get it listed on atomicdex, afterwards u just put up your "ico" coins for trade on the atomicdex. That would be the easiest way to make a decentralized ico.

[02-Dec-19 09:15 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus yeah but considered that soft cap needs more coins as people purchase, that would not be the case, also there is very little liquidity on atomicdex, so unless people would be willing to use it only for the ico, hmm

[02-Dec-19 09:17 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama I believe liquidity is low due to it being in beta stage, when beta is over there will even be liquidity providers running market makers

[02-Dec-19 09:19 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus yeah, and also it is only an app, so it would be pretty hard to get people use it atm

[02-Dec-19 09:20 AM] Markus#5464
atomicdex will be available on all devices not just mobile phones

[02-Dec-19 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
there will be web based version afaik

[02-Dec-19 09:23 AM] zenosama#5371
yeaah, but I am searching for a solution atm

[02-Dec-19 09:24 AM] zenosama#5371
so anyone know, could give some guidance, into how there would be possible to create a soft cap smart chain ico? at least where could one start

[02-Dec-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
could you explain exactly what you mean by soft cap please?

[02-Dec-19 09:43 AM] Alright#0419
@zenosama

[02-Dec-19 09:45 AM] zenosama#5371
@Alright in example there is a set MVP for 1m$, the crowdsale starts today. However, it is set to end in 1 month. So even if a project gathers 2m$ in 2days, the crowdsale still ends in 1 month, and the funds are being added till then

[02-Dec-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
VRSC will have this functionality

{Reactions}

[02-Dec-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
There is a parameter you could use that would allow a specific pubkey to print additional coins

[02-Dec-19 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
don't think it's integrated into antara composer, but I could walk you through how to use it. Not really sure how VRSC solution works, might be better

[02-Dec-19 09:49 AM] Alright#0419
could also just premine way more coins than you could possibly sell

[02-Dec-19 09:49 AM] Alright#0419
burn the rest when you're done

[02-Dec-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
have you used the app? Seems perfect for an ICO `yeah, and also it is only an app, so it would be pretty hard to get people use it atm` don't understand what you mean by this

[03-Dec-19 12:14 PM] Regnar#6164
I think this post might also be relevant here so I'm copy and pasting from #komodo-team. It's a tweet by Internet Wayback machine about letting family and friends save deceased people's tweets from being deleted by Twitter based on the new terms of service. I'm wondering if this would be possible using Antara Composer.

`Hey team, it might be a cool idea marketing wise and also to showcase what can be done with Antara, to build an Antara smartchain to put these tweets on a blockchain. We could throw an explorer up that lets people view their deceased friend's and family's twitters and give it over to the Internet Wayback Machine. Make the nodes public so others can contribute to maintaining it, and make the blocks mined on demand (when new people are added)`

There's no better reason to support the #WaybackMachine than this. https://t.co/rtxuDav228 https://t.co/jftBn1wxwO
Twitter

[03-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Regnar#6164
Or it could run hand in hand with Wayback Machine where they save the tweets like they would normally, and they add a link to their page that shows the tweet on an block explorer. Plenty of ways to cut this, but might be a cool marketing/proof of concept idea.
