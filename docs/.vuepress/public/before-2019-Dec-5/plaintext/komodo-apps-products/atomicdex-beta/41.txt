@NNoperator asset chain coins are available on Atomicdex-API right now. Or on early versions of chainswap and hyperdex

Anyone have the same issue?

[31-Jul-19 05:57 AM] miles#6381
Hi @veldahar - yup - just looking at the same issue that started last night, transaction history showing in wallet but no balance so can’t swap - weird thing is that the explorer for them shows zero balance and zero transaction history! https://morty.explorer.dexstats.info

@gcharang - are there any issues with the rick and north chains this morning that could be causing the issue? Would you like me to send the logs?

Thank youuu

[31-Jul-19 06:08 AM] gcharang#6833
@miles 
We migrated the RICK & MORTY test-chains to new and more economic smart chains with a hybrid PoW and PoS structure. Faucets have been reset and you have to request new funds for testing. AtomicDEX mobile will automagically use the new chains and thus not contain your old RICK/MORTY balances.

[31-Jul-19 06:08 AM] gcharang#6833
use the faucets to get the coins again

To update AtomicDEX on Android:
```
Playstore -> Hamburger menu (in left - top corner ) -> My apps and games -> Installed -> find AtomicDEX and click update
```
or, it will be updated normally along with the other apps when that happens

If the PlayStore doesn't have the updated version, clear the PlayStore cache

Yes - we upgraded the Rick & Morty chains so your balance will be 0. Faucets were upgraded too so you can just request new testcoins.
