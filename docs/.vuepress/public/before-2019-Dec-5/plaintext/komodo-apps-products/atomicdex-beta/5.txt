@TonyL noted thx

[16-Jul-19 12:58 AM] ca333#0118
we are adding a check for this and automagic fee deduction based on the cointype you are swapping for the next release

[16-Jul-19 12:58 AM] kimlab#2992
@TonyL Can I get some RICKY, MORTY Coin? My atomicDEX addr: RKJ7YJUftACw4hyV8xG7g3KGSdCJeBjSXh

@TonyL thanks

I saw earlier that someone suggested that when AtomicDEX is doing a swap that the phone is kept from timing out. I think that would be a good idea; TabTrader does this. I would think a liquidity provider would want this feature also.

[16-Jul-19 01:02 AM] allbits#5898
Yes I do

[16-Jul-19 01:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Without ETH for gas on balance magic can not happen. Anyway, please wait for a version with fixed logs 🙏

[16-Jul-19 01:03 AM] allbits#5898
Ok

[16-Jul-19 01:07 AM] yorklab#7270
When in the DEX and clicking on the Receive coin; next to KMD and Bitcoin it states: "Click to create an orc" what is orc - Order?

[16-Jul-19 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
should be "Click to create an order" here 🤔

Also on my Note 8 I noticed when creating a password and didn't have a special character that I needed, there was a warning in red below that telling me what I needed for that password, but it didn't state the entire paragraph. I think it ended with something like" ....a lower ca..." it ended with those three dots.

[16-Jul-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for report! Will try to reproduce

[16-Jul-19 01:16 AM] clark5251#0842

when trying to sell DOGE for BTC, when entering Amount to Sell, it only allows me 4 digits. When I hit the 5th digit, the whole string erases. I can't actually enter enough DOGE to satisfy the BTC minimum amount (0.0077 BTC, or roughly 27200 DOGE)

[16-Jul-19 01:27 AM] nasbats#7785
I can confirm a succesful DOGE for KMD sale, though 😃

When I try to make a KMDBTC swap this loading notifications shows when I try to select the feceiving currency. Then after a while it disapears and I still can't select the receiving currency.
