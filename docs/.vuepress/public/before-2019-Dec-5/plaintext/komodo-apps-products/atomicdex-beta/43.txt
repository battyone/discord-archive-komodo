This is from the orderbook but doesn't work

[31-Jul-19 04:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Can confirm there is a little problems with auto order matching in some cases (there is some rounding missmatch between frontend and backend and consistency should be achieved in next mm2 update). What you can do is manually create DOGE - KMD order with price better than price in orderbook and in that case it should match you with seller

what determines the ETH fee (0.0015) when withdrawing ETH? It seems waaay on the high side. An option to set a gas price would be nice?

[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] JvdP#8992
also, it would be nice if the app would ignore the "<coin>:" at the start of an address that Ledger Live puts there when generating a QR code

[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] JvdP#8992
right now it generates "ethereum:0x....." and the app says invalid address until I manually remove the prefix

I guess this may be a bit difficult to implement but...

[31-Jul-19 11:50 PM] nymkappa#9440
Do you plan to allow the user to fill multiple swap using a single front-end order?
For example, in the order book there are the following swap request like this:
```
price  - max vol   -  receive
0.5 MORTY - 100 MORTY - 0.5 MORTY
0.5 MORTY - 200 MORTY - 0.5 MORTY
```

[31-Jul-19 11:52 PM] nymkappa#9440
That would be really nice for the UX if I could fill both orders at the same time using a single actions from atomixDEX.
That would pretty much correspond to a `Market buy` filling as much order as needed until my maximum prices is reached.

So, the "Market swap order" would be:
```150 RICK for 300 MORTY```
And it would fill both pending swap request at once.

[01-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jward01#5133
Hey all!  I am new here and have done a ton of reading on Komodo AtomicDEX and have a few questions (I'll write a blog post about it later), first both parties need to create wallets on the Komodo AtomicDEX Wallet (??).  Any API/Smart contract non-GUI commands?

Then I can send BTC to a 'pre configured BTC address that is watched by AtomicDEX.

AtomicDEX will create an order, then swap my BTC for ETH directly in my wallet all via smart contract
Is there anywhere I can read about this, I have spent like 4 hours reading about this and love it! I just haven't found examples of what your talking about.  Only high-level chatter

[01-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jward01#5133
or code examples? thanks a ton for your help!

[01-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jward01#5133
BTC -- > ETH
ETH <-- BTC

[01-Aug-19 03:32 AM] jspook16#3059
@jward01 Im not part of the team but have been following for a while. Atomicdex is essentially a wallet with a DEX interface. You can either import an existing komodo address wallet or create a new address wallet in atomicdex. If you import an existing wallet, your coins (compatible coins ~ 99% of existing coins) should be accessible to send, receive, or trade. If you create a new wallet you will have to send your coins to the new wallet address(es) (BTC will have a unique non kmd type address and so will some other type of coins that are not komodo asset chains). Once they are in your new wallet you can send, receive and trade as you wish. When you trade, BTC to ETH for example, you use the DEX functionality and create your order that you want to trade. When you go to place it, you can select from existing liquidity or create a new order at your desired rate. Once it is matched, the rest is taken care of automatically. It leaves your wallet and the traded assets are sent directly to your wallet. Pure awesome'ness from jl777 and Komodo Team.
