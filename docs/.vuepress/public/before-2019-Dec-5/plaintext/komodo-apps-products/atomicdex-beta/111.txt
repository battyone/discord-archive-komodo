With all the volume from digitalprice I would say around : 30-50k$ per day - that‚Äôs around 15 usd or kmd as reward from one dex per year, if all the kmd assets only traded on AtomicDEX ü§ûü§ûü§û

[04-Nov-19 10:33 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
@vogelfreund88 i'm trying to calculate myself.  I believe the trading fees are 0.15% of a trade.  So if AtomicDex goes crazy and has $1,000,000 of trade volume per day, thats $365,000,000 per year.  0.15% of $365,000,000 is $547,500.  DEX holders receive half of that or $$273,750.  Divide that by 1 million DEX and its about 27 cents return per DEX coin per year.  I'm not sure if that math is right, but thats what I've been thinking about on whether to buy DEX or not

[04-Nov-19 10:45 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
that‚Äôs a lot of time get the money back if you buy for 30,50 or 100 kmd per dex

[04-Nov-19 10:54 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
yeah, I'm wondering if my math is wrong or something in my assumptions is incorrect

[04-Nov-19 10:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where do you get half is paid to dex holders?

[04-Nov-19 10:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah wait nvm

[04-Nov-19 10:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
50 to DEX, 15% to jumblr etc

[04-Nov-19 10:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@cryptoclueless it will all depend on real volume... 1mio is only 100btc at todays btc prices, but if btc goes to 50k by 2021 its only 20btc volume...

[04-Nov-19 10:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If atomicdex supports ARRR it will become the largest possible mixer for any coin

[04-Nov-19 10:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much volume do the mixer wallets take?

[04-Nov-19 11:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If atomicdex is used for dICO‚Äôs or whatever the name is

[04-Nov-19 11:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What will be the volume for that etc

[04-Nov-19 11:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You just cant predict what it will be, atm we just know the potential is there and is wider than simply trading because of arrr/dico/... other applications the protocol can have

[04-Nov-19 11:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is 1% of binance volume for example?

[04-Nov-19 11:04 PM] allbits#5898
1,000,000 of daily volume is hardly "going crazy" for an exchange. That's a tiny, tiny CEX in today's environment

[04-Nov-19 11:06 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
1% of binance is 11 million

[04-Nov-19 11:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1 billion daily volume on binance. 1mio daily would be only 0.1%

[04-Nov-19 11:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep

[04-Nov-19 11:07 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I agree that ARRR could help in changing that too

[04-Nov-19 11:08 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I also saw that post on Dune the other day, so it definitely seems like there is a lot of potential even outside of trading on AtomicDex

[04-Nov-19 11:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX also get revenue from all dex‚Äôs using MM2.0, so not just atomicdex

[04-Nov-19 11:16 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
well I picked up some DEX at 20 KMD and 30 KMD, so time will tell.  I was excited to get some when it first showed up on AtomicDex.

[04-Nov-19 11:34 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
Who is selling you that DEX tho? Where did it come from?

[04-Nov-19 11:36 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
not sure, but its on AtomicDex

[04-Nov-19 11:39 PM] PTYX#6840
There was an airdrop some time back as well

[04-Nov-19 11:40 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
was that to kmd holders or something else, I'm relatively new to this

[04-Nov-19 11:58 PM] allbits#5898
Originally DEX was an an asset on NXT blockchain, created in 2014. It was issued to some early backers of jl777 in the nxt community.  Then an after market developed on NXT asset exchange and many people acquired from there. It was migrated to Komodo based chain a couple of years ago.

@kmdkrazy was you a taker or maker in this trade? as I can see taker sent fee and after it maker went offline and even not sent swap status to the seednodes

[05-Nov-19 02:06 AM] TonyL#3577
If you was maker please DM me your log

hi. where is the order book stored?

[05-Nov-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
no single place

[05-Nov-19 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
decentralised....

[05-Nov-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
as nodes submit orders, it is sent to the network. remembering what orders locally is what allows to create what looks like a traditional orderbook

[05-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Mark81#4505
commod chain stalled? No blocks in last half hour.

[05-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Mark81#4505
Last notarized block 23036 and now stalled to 23046.

[05-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Mark81#4505
something to do with notary nodes?

[05-Nov-19 01:40 PM] aguycalled#1820
thx, so i assume they are not stored on chain

[05-Nov-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely not onchain

[05-Nov-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise there would be a blockchain txfee for every orderbook change

[05-Nov-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
totally unscalable if done that way

[05-Nov-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and expensive and inconvenient

[05-Nov-19 02:48 PM] ca333#0118
@kmdkrazy can you check the order-item in the history tab - it should have a button there to release the funds IF they re stuck.

[05-Nov-19 02:52 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
Hi, i have question about atomicdex. If both taker and maker had sucessfully send funds to the smart address start with b.. Will the swap still possible be timeout?

[05-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Oszy#5734
only if one of the tx-es remain uncomfirmed for a long time, I believe it could still timeout

[05-Nov-19 02:59 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
I see. Thanks, i just tried swapping. My fund was send to a smart address but still ended up timeout. I'll wait for my fund to come back then

[05-Nov-19 03:00 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
And another question, if timeout, that would means we'll lose some tx fees right?

[05-Nov-19 03:00 PM] Oszy#5734
yes, you get Dex Fee + amount back - minus tx fees

[05-Nov-19 03:01 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
Thanks for the explanations

[05-Nov-19 03:01 PM] Oszy#5734
refund should not take more than 4 hours, report back if there's any problem

[05-Nov-19 03:02 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
Okay. Thanks again

[05-Nov-19 03:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
No release button @ca333

[05-Nov-19 03:18 PM] kmdkrazy#8280

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on pull request #114: atomicDEX Turkish Support
Really good localization overall, thanks a lot.

I did not check where these words are used in the real UI, so I don't know the contexts but here are some potential mistakes I detected:

Line 13: `login` is translated as `Giri≈ü`,  is uppercase G correct?

Line 523:  `By` is translated as `Yazan:` - is the colon(:) correct here?

Line 588 and 595 has `{index}. word`, the dot there with `-th, -rd` is missing at Turkish translation like `{index} kelime`. Index will be a number here like ...

Ensure that you have stored a backup of your 12 word seed phrase and delete the app and reinstall

[06-Nov-19 04:31 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
some sort of issue from updating out of specific old versions, once you manually reinstall you shouldn't have to do this again

Anyone else have swaps complete but screen doesn‚Äôt show it? Got to 2/3 and just stopped. It had been plenty of time to complete Rick/Morty swap, so I checked history and it showed completed. Don‚Äôt think the timing was coincidence, seems like the progress screen stalled.

[06-Nov-19 04:58 PM] tolken#2655
I never switched away or let screen go to sleep, fwiw

[06-Nov-19 04:59 PM] tolken#2655
As a matter of fact, I kept poking the screen to keep-alive.

[06-Nov-19 05:01 PM] tolken#2655
While I dig the simplicity of the swap progress screen, some additional details would be cool to see. If each ‚Äú3rd‚Äù section of the progress graphic had subtle subdivisions indicating other steps in the smart contract execution, would be sweet.

[06-Nov-19 09:33 PM] Oszy#5734
@ca333
Is there some sort of rounding up / down for BTC amounts when creating a new order in atomicDEX, or did I find another bug? at 6 digit amounts for the base coin it rounds way too much and actually down when entering into the orderbook, so if you don't watch out you sell  much cheaper than what you set. 

At 5 digits, it's rounding up 0.002-0.003 BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin.
At 6 digits it's rounding down 0.0015-0.002! BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin. (I used 99999 and 555555 amounts for COMMOD, and 0.0077777 for BTC in both cases)

Can DM screenshots, let me know.

[06-Nov-19 09:34 PM] Oszy#5734
