I added my App Store email address by using the link in the initial email that said I got onto the beta. I haven‚Äôt received a followup email to the email I use on AppStore, been a couple days. Should I have heard from someone by now?

[15-Jul-19 09:55 PM] Camilo Lopez#8651
Is this the formal invitation??

[15-Jul-19 09:55 PM] ca333#0118
these with an invitation mail can access the app @SHossain - let me know if a pre-registered and invited user cant access it

[15-Jul-19 09:57 PM] Mcrypt#4468
here

[15-Jul-19 09:57 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@Daniel CP Ok, just saw it (I was reading pretty old msgs, first...) but I received the invitation email, does it mean it should be available at the Play Store?

[15-Jul-19 09:58 PM] Tony Stark#4609
@SHossain Yes, I received an email, telling me to come to this room, but I'm seeing the same error posted by @Camilo Lopez

[15-Jul-19 09:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 the above users registered and received invitation

[15-Jul-19 09:59 PM] Tony Stark#4609
if I go manually to Atomic DEX page on Google Play, it shows me the option to cancel registration only, not to install the app

[15-Jul-19 10:00 PM] Tony Stark#4609

I'm ready to start testing. Can I try to swap like KMD to RFOX? Or RFOX to K64

[15-Jul-19 10:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
anyone with ios that is having that problem?

[15-Jul-19 10:02 PM] Mcrypt#4468
is there even one person here who was able to install it?

[15-Jul-19 10:03 PM] yorklab#7270
I haven't. My google email address is deferent from my invitation email address so hopefully that doesn't create an issue.

[15-Jul-19 10:03 PM] hastrup#8742
I also can't install the app

[15-Jul-19 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if you didn't register with google play store email, you can't test

[15-Jul-19 10:04 PM] yorklab#7270
I did.

[15-Jul-19 10:05 PM] yorklab#7270
I get the "unregister" sign now.

[15-Jul-19 10:07 PM] allbits#5898
I have the same issue, getting the unregister sign now

[15-Jul-19 10:11 PM] yorklab#7270
@SHossain I remember now, I sent you my google email in a DM because I had read that was how to sign up at the time. Then later signed up officially, but maybe used a different address, so maybe I don't have the google email address registered after all. Don't know now.üôÑ

[15-Jul-19 10:13 PM] Mcrypt#4468
go to sleep now... hope this is getting fixed soon

[15-Jul-19 10:17 PM] NNoperator#3835
Hi I can't seem to get through the email address verification step.  Clicking just takes me back to the AtomicDEX signup page.

[15-Jul-19 10:18 PM] hastrup#8742
@Mcrypt me to

[15-Jul-19 10:19 PM] allbits#5898
That link gives me the same result: app not available

[15-Jul-19 10:19 PM] yorklab#7270
@ca333 Same issue. Maybe I need to delete my cookies?

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Markus#5464
sounds like they missed to click some sort of "publish test version" button

[15-Jul-19 10:21 PM] ca333#0118
@yorklab - dm me your playstore email address - i will check if its in the list

Are you 100% sure it's the email you use for your Google Store @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± ?

[15-Jul-19 10:38 PM] Audo#5667
checked, you are in @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±

I can't download  @Audo

[15-Jul-19 10:39 PM] Kiruel#2091
Like if you open your Google Store from your phone what do you see ?

[15-Jul-19 10:39 PM] Audo#5667
in the list that got email at least... I'll let ca333 check the playstore

[15-Jul-19 10:39 PM] Audo#5667
at least his email was not on the list that got an error

[15-Jul-19 10:40 PM] ca333#0118
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you are in the list - can you check if you are able now?

[15-Jul-19 10:41 PM] ca333#0118
we didnt do anything now and @benzo365 was suddenly able to download it, i guess google playstore needs some time to process and propagate this.

[15-Jul-19 10:42 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Hi! I received a mail to join this channel for the beta test, but when i search on play store still unavailable to download

[15-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Audo#5667
did you guys receive any email from play store regarding the invite? or only from us?

[15-Jul-19 10:49 PM] yorklab#7270
Mine was from you guys.

[15-Jul-19 10:49 PM] yorklab#7270
but to my hotmail address.

[15-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Audo#5667
Yorklab I saw your email on the error list

[15-Jul-19 10:50 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, ca said he added me, but still not working....it might take time.

[15-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Audo#5667
I see, ok

[15-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Kiruel#2091
@yorklab It takes time.

[15-Jul-19 10:51 PM] Kiruel#2091
If after 12h you have still nothing ping here.

[15-Jul-19 10:51 PM] yorklab#7270
OK. If I have to be on the next list that's OK also. I'll wait either way.

[15-Jul-19 10:51 PM] nasbats#7785
Hey, I was also having the "A testing version of this app hasn't been published yet or isn't available for this account.".  Checked back and refreshed after 20 minutes and it came through

[15-Jul-19 10:51 PM] nasbats#7785
takes some time for google to get it to their different data centers 'round the world it seems

[15-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Kiruel#2091
Yes.

[15-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Kiruel#2091
It's normal, play store is really big.
