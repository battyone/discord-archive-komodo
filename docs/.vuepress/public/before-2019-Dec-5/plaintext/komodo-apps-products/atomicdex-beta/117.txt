Is there a way to back trace my swaps? I forgot how much I paid for some of my assets

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #129 Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
Wallet transaction keep resetting to to first transaction while scrolling through history

[17-Nov-19 07:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@kmdkrazy in the orders tab it shows the successful swaps

[17-Nov-19 07:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Go to DEX -> history

[17-Nov-19 08:22 PM] Oszy#5734
guess he can't find an old one (history is limited)

[17-Nov-19 09:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I need to find out how much I paid for what and yeah I'm trying to go back to 2017 swaps...

[17-Nov-19 10:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
October isn't even showing..... Some local DB / custom web based  transaction search for amounts paid would be cool if I knew where and how to look up this information I could have a programmer write some type of query

[17-Nov-19 10:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Not even sure where to start except atomic explorer with my address

[17-Nov-19 10:03 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I just want to do it Emanuel for now

[17-Nov-19 10:12 PM] Oszy#5734
You can check explorers if you have a rough estimate in mind about the dates and coins

[17-Nov-19 11:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I just cant seem to get past the p2sh address it came from to find out the amount of what I traded....

Not sure which one to click and cant seem to get to where I need to look exactly...
I've only tried for 10 minutes tho

[18-Nov-19 05:57 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Out of curiosity, about how much time (hrs) on average, does it take to add a project like BNB, an Ethereum based ERC20) project, or one in the Komodo Ecosystem?
Btw we are very appreciative of your hard work and very proud of the project.

[18-Nov-19 06:06 AM] gcharang#6833
I am not sure which blockchain tech BNB uses, so can't comment on that

adding  a Komodo Smart chain is just writing a json and submitting a PR to the coins repo <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins>
```json
{
    "coin": "LABS",
    "asset": "LABS",
    "fname": "KMD Labs",
    "rpcport": 40265,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "required_confirmations": 2
  }
```
adding erc20 is similar but, the contract has to be verified if it has all the necessary methods. most standard erc20 should be compatible

[18-Nov-19 06:07 AM] gcharang#6833
* electrum servers and explorer links should be submitted too

[18-Nov-19 06:10 AM] Privatoshi#9487
BNB is BEP2, which is Binance Chain token type (BEP2)

[18-Nov-19 06:11 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It is similar to Tendermint.

[18-Nov-19 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
we haven't integrated any tendermint protocol coins/tokens yet
so it will take a lot of time to implement the first one

[18-Nov-19 06:13 AM] Privatoshi#9487
What about bUSD

[18-Nov-19 06:13 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Binance stablecoin

[18-Nov-19 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
the current priority is to optimise the current working pairs

[18-Nov-19 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
is bUSD erc20?

[18-Nov-19 06:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
For sure. I was actually just curious on how long it takes you guys.

[18-Nov-19 06:14 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm been using it since initial beta and I'm trying to get an idea of the time and the effort, put into it.

[18-Nov-19 06:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Let me check

[18-Nov-19 06:15 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I think you're right

[18-Nov-19 06:16 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Lol CZ probably enjoys weighing down the Eth network

[18-Nov-19 06:17 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah, if it is ERC20 and has the required methods, it can be added very easily to the cli

[18-Nov-19 06:20 AM] gcharang#6833
> I'm been using it since initial beta and I'm trying to get an idea of the time and the effort, put into it.
we have ETH/erc20 and btc protocol (btc forks, zcash and its forks and komodo and its smart chains) swaps already implemented
so adding one of those is just adding their details to a file and doing a test swap

for new protocols, it is a completely different story
we need to get in touch with their developers and code their swap entirely from scratch. So, it depends

[18-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I'm extremely impressed.

Thanks for the hard work.

[18-Nov-19 06:52 AM] Oszy#5734
@kmdkrazy when you have time and the amount of "Coin A" follow to the "b" address, see the address who received your "Coin A", and look up that address in "Coin B" explorer to see how much that address sent to a "b" address around the same time.

[18-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Redman#2839
Trying to understand what happens if I post a swap and the whole order isn't filled. Is the total sum reversed back to all parties that contributed ?

[18-Nov-19 11:11 AM] Redman#2839
Sorry for my naivety.

[18-Nov-19 11:28 AM] Oszy#5734
No it stays up until fully filled

[18-Nov-19 11:29 AM] Oszy#5734
also, orders are individual, peer to peer, they do not add up into one order.

[18-Nov-19 08:01 PM] artik123#2884
Hi. A small comment regarding the mobile AtomicDex.
I think that having to scroll down the End user license agreement (EULA) to get the next button enabled is annoying and self-righteous

[18-Nov-19 08:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Have to make users go through it to shield from liability

[18-Nov-19 08:39 PM] artik123#2884
I can't remenber when was the last time I had to do it...

[18-Nov-19 08:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
people shouldn't be blindly accepting terms & conditions

[18-Nov-19 08:40 PM] artik123#2884
@mrlynch don't be self-righteous. No one reads it

[18-Nov-19 08:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
why would you assume i'm self-righteous? have we met?

[18-Nov-19 08:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
i read t&c's as a hobby

[18-Nov-19 08:41 PM] artik123#2884
Good for tou

[18-Nov-19 08:41 PM] artik123#2884
*you

[18-Nov-19 08:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe people should take 2 minutes to read terms & conditions, we probably wouldn't see crass violations of privacy if it were to happen

[18-Nov-19 08:43 PM] artik123#2884
Are you serious? üôÇ

[18-Nov-19 08:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, very

[18-Nov-19 08:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you read t&c's you will be surprised how much crap people accept blindly

[18-Nov-19 08:55 PM] Oszy#5734

When was the last time that a software forced you to read a EULA?

[18-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Oszy#5734
Many websites do not let you continue until you scroll trough

[18-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Oszy#5734
It's for your own good.

[18-Nov-19 08:57 PM] artik123#2884
For example?

[18-Nov-19 08:58 PM] Oszy#5734
banks, loan sites, etc

[18-Nov-19 08:58 PM] artik123#2884
Give me one to check

[18-Nov-19 08:58 PM] artik123#2884
Send a link

[18-Nov-19 09:00 PM] artik123#2884
If someone wants to read he will read. But forcing him is another issue

[18-Nov-19 09:00 PM] artik123#2884
It's useless

[18-Nov-19 09:02 PM] artik123#2884
And regardless you can't force. People scroll just to get the button enbaled

[18-Nov-19 09:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
so scroll and get the button enabled

[18-Nov-19 09:03 PM] artik123#2884
No

[18-Nov-19 09:03 PM] artik123#2884
Just get the button enabled for easy of use

[18-Nov-19 09:03 PM] artik123#2884
That would be the better solution

[18-Nov-19 09:04 PM] phm87#7395
We should ask the user what is the fifth word of the 17th sentence of terms and conditions (and add questions to check understanding)

[18-Nov-19 09:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
@phm87 that wouldn't be a bad idea

[18-Nov-19 09:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
or maybe just squeeze a clause in there
`17.(c). You agree unequivocally, for the duration of usage of this software, to automatically transfer 50% of every transaction received to mrlynch.`

p.s.: i am in no way associated with atomicdex, but that looks like a good clause since most will agree anyway

[18-Nov-19 09:16 PM] phm87#7395
@mrlynch sorry I though I was on another channel... it was a joke
Your clause 17.(c) is cool but mrlynch entity needs to be defined in details (full KYC to avoid frausters)

[18-Nov-19 09:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
no it doesn't since you agree to the terms blindly, you could agree just as much to burn half the funds ü§∑

[18-Nov-19 09:18 PM] artik123#2884
Do you really want AtomicDex to take on itself to educate users?
99% don't read, therefore it should be enabled... for the rest 1% they could still read it if they want... noone will stop them. In 2019 you live in a user choice world. It's up to the user to decide. And anyway you can't force him. It doesn't make any sense to me. You just stick with old (and wrong) convention

[18-Nov-19 09:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
why would you want/need kyc anyway?

[18-Nov-19 09:19 PM] artik123#2884
Regulation

[18-Nov-19 09:20 PM] artik123#2884
Noone want's it... it's just a must

[18-Nov-19 09:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
i don't speak for atomicdex. i'm merely appaled by your statement. "just enable it, 'cause i don't read anyway"

[18-Nov-19 09:21 PM] mrlynch#5735

[18-Nov-19 09:21 PM] artik123#2884
For EULA I already showed you that noone forces you to scroll therefore scrolling is not a must, therefore we don't need it

[18-Nov-19 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
could have read it by now instead of talking about it here üòõ

[18-Nov-19 09:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
read the tos to bittrex & bitfinex while you're at it.. might not want an account over there after you do

It's annoying to you to know any rights you might have if something goes horribly wrong?
