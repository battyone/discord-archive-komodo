I have 7.77 kmd in wallet

[18-Jul-19 12:26 AM] 27aume#8635
And now i get "all electrum servers are offline"
Migth be the problem

[18-Jul-19 12:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think you need eth in your wallet for gas fees

[18-Jul-19 12:30 AM] 27aume#8635
Its not the other party that have to pay gas? Im trying to buy ETH ü§î

[18-Jul-19 12:30 AM] 27aume#8635
Not sell some

[18-Jul-19 12:32 AM] cipi#4502
both parties need ETH... you, the taker needs to call the swap contract on the ETH chain to get the ETH, and that costs gas

[18-Jul-19 12:32 AM] cipi#4502
electrums are fine... looks like networking...

[18-Jul-19 12:33 AM] 27aume#8635
Interesting, a bit unexpected but well it is what it is.

I was going to get some eth to pay for tx fee of trading other erc20

[18-Jul-19 12:34 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i know, it is crap, Vitalik Buterin haven't thought this well üòÉ

[18-Jul-19 12:34 AM] 27aume#8635
XD you killed me

[18-Jul-19 12:37 AM] 27aume#8635
I will test with other assets then XD.

[18-Jul-19 12:40 AM] 27aume#8635
KMD > RFOX available guys only for 1 kmd do

[18-Jul-19 01:03 AM] tolken#2655
Maybe Kmd will get extra fancy and have a pool of eth do draw from for dex users... but yea, eth has grown long in the tooth

[18-Jul-19 01:57 AM] cipi#4502
the problem with ETH gas is even bigger... look at this tx:  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x91ad987b51e9cf2838764150ab0c1d1b95ddef9e45f3d61bdd4548d5924332bb
value of transferred coin: $1.33
txfee: $0.37
so in order to not loose money, the margin should have been 50% or more on this swap
atm i help me by removing all ERC20 orders from orderbook when gasprice > 20 gwei
the above tx was with 21 Gwei, so i should remove the orders when gasprice > 5 gwei, but ok, i want to let people test all this üòÉ

[18-Jul-19 02:00 AM] cipi#4502
the other solution is to add a feature of `minvolume` for orders, so that the taker must buy at least x amount of the tokens for the swap to start... but that is not implemented yet

Is it ok to put the app into background while swapping in progress? My test swap seems to be stuck at Swap Ongoing stage.

[18-Jul-19 04:11 AM] xin#8037
It has been about 20 minutes now and still ongoing

[18-Jul-19 04:11 AM] TonyL#3577
are you on Android or iOS? In general it should be ok on Android

[18-Jul-19 04:11 AM] xin#8037
iOS

[18-Jul-19 04:12 AM] TonyL#3577
oh, on iOS there is limitation - unlilke android it does not swap in the background at the moment

I found that the issue is coming when clicking on KMD or Rick.

[18-Jul-19 04:20 AM] t0sma#0368
Before that the others are working fine

[18-Jul-19 04:21 AM] t0sma#0368
When you restart the app, it's ok

[18-Jul-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for video! Will investigate

Not sure if this issue has been addressed: after claiming KMD rewards in the atomicDEX app, you can no longer see your KMD transaction history. (When tapping on a coin in portfolio section, it normally displays transaction history, but after claiming, it seems to get erased, or fails to display)

[18-Jul-19 04:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@Vanncoins Is app reopening helps in such cases?

[18-Jul-19 05:03 AM] Simon#6247
Guys can i please get an invite? I recieved an email on the 10th of july. I changed my email to the same email of my appstore (the .icloud.com mail) and haven‚Äôt recieved anything since

@Simon i have the same problem. I think we should wait our turn. Or not??

[18-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Simon#6247
I don‚Äôt know ...

[18-Jul-19 05:11 AM] xin#8037
@TonyL thanks, I tried to keep the screen open and the swap succeeded. Another issue I found is, if I tap on Send, and then tap on the camera icon next to the Recipient address field, it crashes the app. I‚Äôm on iOS.

[18-Jul-19 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Access to beta-testeting providing in batches - if you has not received email that you're in first testers batch access will be provided eventually during this/next week.
@Simon please DM me your email
@Sanyadurnov please DM me your email. Did you enroll for Android or iOS testing?

@xin thank you for report! this crash will be fixed in next version

[18-Jul-19 05:18 AM] Sanyadurnov#9361
@TonyL thx, i thought so..

[18-Jul-19 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Jul-19 05:33 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I have a mild suggestion for the dex. How about having like a trading competition for people who use the dex with the highest volume after the beta comes out? You know like the binance style trading event. Peeps with highest trading volume gets some kmd and so on. That will really do the stress test rolling.

[18-Jul-19 05:36 AM] DigitalPunk#0381
What a easy a quick experience using the DEX, well worth the wait. Well done Komodo Team! I understand staking KMD is possible in the dex , is the minimum balance still 10KMD?

[18-Jul-19 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô I think it's good idea but at first AtomicDEX should be polished (before massive trading with real funds)

[18-Jul-19 05:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@DigitalPunk Thank you for feedback!
 Rewards generating (it's not staking technically because you dont need to keep wallet online to generate rewards) is the same for KMD blockchain in general  (it's determining by blockchain protocol, not GUI) - UTXOs > 10 KMD starting to generate rewards in 1 hour after "maturing"

[18-Jul-19 05:40 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to claim it once per 30 days to keep generation

[18-Jul-19 05:40 AM] DigitalPunk#0381
@TonyL  üëç

[18-Jul-19 05:45 AM] DigitalPunk#0381
@TonyL any idea when chainzilla will be added to DEX ?

[18-Jul-19 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Ecosystem coins should be added eventually, but I don't have information on ETAs/process

[18-Jul-19 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
It's in early beta üòÉ

If i click on Dex, i can only choose Rick and Morty to trade on iOS.
Strange

[18-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Acura#2748
Version 0.1.2

[18-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Acura#2748
Btc and kmd is also activated, but can only choose rick and Morty

[18-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
Do you have any other funds?

[18-Jul-19 07:01 AM] Alecandro#1179
I don‚Äôt think you can trade rick or morty for other coins?

[18-Jul-19 07:02 AM] Acura#2748
Ahh ok, that can be a reason

[18-Jul-19 07:03 AM] Alecandro#1179

Idk I‚Äôm confused haha

[18-Jul-19 07:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Technically RICK and MORTY same coins as other KMD assetchains, just don't have any real USD value

[18-Jul-19 07:05 AM] Alecandro#1179
So would it work for BTC then?

[18-Jul-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Technically you can swap RICK/MORTY with any coin which presists in AtomicDEX

[18-Jul-19 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Our basic QA test is swap of everything with RICK in closed trading network üòÉ

@TonyL sorry for delayed reply, was sleeping. No reopening app doesn‚Äôt seem to correct the issue. Still fails to display KMD transaction history after claiming reward once

[18-Jul-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you! Will try to reproduce on my side

[18-Jul-19 07:52 AM] Vanncoins#3044
@wl they were trying out IFTTT (if this, then that) which is an online application automation service. The RT bot wasn‚Äôt configured properly and went haywire lmao. It blew up my phone and woke me up at 3:30 am. I ain‚Äôt even mad

[18-Jul-19 07:53 AM] wl#4107
Yah, I had to mute it...

[18-Jul-19 07:53 AM] Vanncoins#3044
It‚Äôs fixed now, they‚Äôve apologized for the inconvenience

@nymkappa could you please try to restart app on your side? (probably app will resolve this swap if you not cleaned cache/deleted app after this swap)
It seems that taker payment does not returned to you yet in 6.1159 VRSC -> 25.0000 RFOX swap
