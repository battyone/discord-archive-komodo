Has anyone succeeded in opening AtomicDex on Nox app player in Winwdows? It crashes on startup.

[16-Oct-19 05:26 AM] Oszy#5734
well it's an emulator so I am not surprised. and I can't emphasize enough, these emulators are bloatwares, do not risk your seed or money using these apps. 
same goes for bluestacks, memu, etc..

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #112:  french translation for "Select a coin" is too long and causes the input field for amount to be too small
If a french speaker reads "Choisissez devise", he can think that a word was forgotten: "Choisissez **la** devise". I'll propose another translation if I found one (I'm native french speaker).

I heard that some dictionaries to translate laws and papers at EC have translation with the same number of words and/or characters. The aim is to have to be at the same page number when you read a text in all languages. I don't know if it can help here.

[16-Oct-19 08:13 PM] phm87#7395
@zatJUM  do you mind if I edit my comments on github to add your proposal (with credits to you of course) ? I'm not sure if it can work (if all other labels begin with conjugated verbs such as "choisissez", it won't match) but as your suggestion is shorter, it is good

[16-Oct-19 08:34 PM] zatJUM#9924

you could include a prompt to save a wallet.dat backup as well

[19-Oct-19 08:30 AM] namax#5496
How do you use the DEX exactly? As a trustless escrow if you want to do a transaction already agreed upon with a friend/a third party?

[19-Oct-19 08:32 AM] namax#5496
There's no market discovery, chart, order book, limit/spot orders or anything like that. So as an exchange set to provide liquidity it isn't efficient as there's no visibility on the other side (buyers when you want to sell or sellers when you want to buy)

[19-Oct-19 08:36 AM] namax#5496
I tried a small test: buy few hush with KMD but I had to go on CMC to evaluate the fair value for the pair first. Then my order is pending and I have no visibility about the other side (Hush sellers / market depth and liquidity) so even if i would like to adjust the price to the opposite side in order to buy on spot (market price) I have no idea how to do that

[19-Oct-19 08:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@namax 
> There's no market discovery, chart, order book
there is, though
we have a p2p orderbook

it is just not displayed in the app yet

[19-Oct-19 08:37 AM] namax#5496
then it would be better to just have a spot buy (atomic swap only) at market price at this stage on the app

[19-Oct-19 08:38 AM] gcharang#6833
> I had to go on CMC to evaluate the fair value for the pair first

when the orderbook is visible, this problem mostly goes away
you can also create a new order at the price you would like

[19-Oct-19 08:38 AM] namax#5496
So it matches the opposite side whatever the pair and even if there's no visibility then it is still possible to use it

[19-Oct-19 08:40 AM] gcharang#6833
you can click on "create an order" and set a price you like

[19-Oct-19 08:40 AM] namax#5496
Cuz if I cancel the order multiple times with different prices (blindly) until it matches, first I pay lot of tx fees and second I might overpay for the coin I want to buy

[19-Oct-19 08:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@namax market buy option can be implemented and it is in our wishlist

[19-Oct-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
no txfees for placing/cancelling orders

[19-Oct-19 08:42 AM] namax#5496
Should be if it's a dex. it opens a smart contract so a tx. What you don't pay is comission until order is fullfilled

[19-Oct-19 08:42 AM] namax#5496
Or am I mistaken?

[19-Oct-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810

Oh Ok. This is good tho

[19-Oct-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
posting/cancelling order does not create the contract, it indicates you are ready to enter into one. until there is a counterparty, there is no contract that can be created

[19-Oct-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is a good design. having to pay to place/cancel orders makes it pretty bad

[19-Oct-19 08:44 AM] namax#5496
alright cool. How about if my order is large and has to match several people on the other side? How is it handled ?

[19-Oct-19 08:45 AM] namax#5496
can't be partially filled right? everything or nothing?

[19-Oct-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
partial fills are supported

[19-Oct-19 08:46 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#atomic-swaps>
it will be partially filled

please see the above doc to understand how our atomic swap protocol works

[19-Oct-19 09:12 AM] namax#5496
you sure there's no tx fee at the root of the request to avoid DDOS? On the app I have 2 fees associated when I want to initialize a transaction: a (small) transaction fees and a (bigger) trading fee

[19-Oct-19 09:12 AM] namax#5496
By forcing a would-be attacker to spend real money, attacking the network becomes costly. Without this spam prevention, AtomicDEX could otherwise be attacked at the protocol level by any person performing a plethora of trade requests.

[19-Oct-19 09:12 AM] gcharang#6833
taker has two txn fee
when you are filling an existing order, you are a taker

[19-Oct-19 09:13 AM] gcharang#6833
> By forcing a would-be attacker to spend real money, attacking the network becomes costly.
this is what the first fee you are seeing as a taker is, called the "dexfee"

[19-Oct-19 09:14 AM] namax#5496
both are only paid if there's a matching order?

[19-Oct-19 09:14 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[19-Oct-19 09:14 AM] gcharang#6833
if you are creating an order yourself, you are a maker and don't pay any trading fee

[19-Oct-19 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
once you see a taker paying the dexfee, you (the maker) send your coins to a intermediate address(p2sh/contract)

[19-Oct-19 09:16 AM] namax#5496
Is it not automatized?

[19-Oct-19 09:16 AM] namax#5496
for the maker?

[19-Oct-19 09:17 AM] namax#5496
where are the trading fees going? to KMD?

[19-Oct-19 09:17 AM] gcharang#6833
it is automated
I'm just saying how the atomicDEX of maker behaves

[19-Oct-19 09:18 AM] namax#5496
Ok. As I have no such maker/taker option on the app I was a bit confused

[19-Oct-19 09:18 AM] namax#5496
actually the app is a kind of multi wallet with a blind swap feature to me

[19-Oct-19 09:19 AM] gcharang#6833
if you use the button that says "create an order", you will become a maker

[19-Oct-19 09:20 AM] gcharang#6833
the app is meant for end users who will mostly be takers
to become a proper maker, you need to run the cli and we are also creating a bot for liquidity providers

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator my test was to swap a few KMD for Hush but I see on the order book you shared there's no liquidity for it (no maker). So on the app user experience isn't great as it's total blindness. Had to came here to figure the whole thing

[19-Oct-19 09:31 AM] namax#5496
Ok sounds good

[19-Oct-19 09:33 AM] namax#5496
Also involved in OTC, I think you could addup later on a contract creation for people to load a contract with a coin (say BTC for KMD), load it with his coin and share it to a counterparty for him to load it too so the contract get executed. kind of what trader.airswap.io is doing but for any coin instead of just ERC20

[19-Oct-19 09:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there are provisions for private OTC trades using the atomic swap tech, though at the moment I believe it requires CLI (i.e. no gui)

```Will direct private trading be possible with AtomicDEX through private needs created on private nodes (not created on AtomicDEX)?
