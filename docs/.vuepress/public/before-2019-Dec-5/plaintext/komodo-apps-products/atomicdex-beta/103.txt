@heguli97 I have more than 200 still nothing(maybe one 1/3)...

[31-Oct-19 05:34 PM] Mark81#4505
is stress test over?

[31-Oct-19 05:35 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
I get 1 complete, 1 timeout, 5 waiting for a match and many more cancelled good stress we get 😬 👍

[31-Oct-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
`is stress test over?` no, 25 more minutes to try your luck

[31-Oct-19 05:35 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Is there a trick to get it running?

[31-Oct-19 05:35 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't know - got 500+ attempts without any luck

[31-Oct-19 05:35 PM] gigamesh#3544
if i check my RICK address in KMD explorer should that show me any swaps i made?

[31-Oct-19 05:36 PM] gigamesh#3544
cuz i see nothing

[31-Oct-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, in general it's possible to check your swaps via RICK/MORTY explorers

[31-Oct-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
by transactions from/to `b` address

[31-Oct-19 05:36 PM] gigamesh#3544
is that in the KMD explorer?

[31-Oct-19 05:37 PM] Strob#3417
There must be some trick cause someone got 19 and got 0 even though I tried since the first second of the test.

final swap data and leaderboard stats will be prepared over the next 24 hours. I will announce here once done and let everyone who sent logs know to get theier verification

[31-Oct-19 05:40 PM] heguli97#5781

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Sir Seven#7158

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And put in a new order

[31-Oct-19 05:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When it matches its usually in the first minute after you put up the order

[31-Oct-19 05:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I had 2 in the past 10-15 mins

[31-Oct-19 05:47 PM] Strob#3417

[31-Oct-19 05:50 PM] tese#3502
While an order is still in the "matching" (0/3) state and you navigate back, and click on the orders tab, then you can't get to the order again by tapping it. Usually, as soon as state 1/3 has started, tapping the order leads you back to its details. (Android)

[31-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@tese You can't get to details 'cause there are pretty much no details to show yet.

[31-Oct-19 05:51 PM] Sir Seven#7158
In 0/3 state

[31-Oct-19 05:51 PM] tese#3502
But you shoud view the 0/3 state

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] tese#3502
The same screen shown after conforming the swap

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] phm87#7395
I updated atomicdex, now i have a black screen when i start it. How can i bypass it ? Uninstall reinstall use existing seed ?

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@phm87 Yes, please make sure you have your seed saved before uninstallation. Oops.

[31-Oct-19 05:53 PM] ubiq#0240
The app use a lot of data ...2.3gb

[31-Oct-19 05:54 PM] phm87#7395
There was less than 1 kmd of value on it so i don t really care abt the seed. Thank you @Cryptoon and @Sir Seven

[31-Oct-19 05:54 PM] TonyL#3577
less than 1 kmd today, 1mil usd tomorrow, who knows 😅

Tried to exchange ltc against dgb between two phones with same rates, but it did not match and exchange.
But when it will work in future...
Wow that's awesome.

Happy to be a part of a revolutionary technology

Thank you all for helping Komodo! Great respect for everyone who was here for hours. I know how hard is was. 😬 Good job guys! 👏🏻👏🏻

[31-Oct-19 06:02 PM] sir#6225
Do any timeout orders count?

[31-Oct-19 06:02 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
Nope nothing for me but a lot of time invest in AtomicDEX 🎃

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] sir#6225
Got like 8 timeouts out of several hundred attempts

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Flint#6435
5-10 minutes before the end, a swap for thousandths of a coin was successful - so Im still lucky!)

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] coingirl87#6489
Me two flint

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I count 30 Swaps and 7 timeout.  Leaderboard Shows 17-0

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe we swap :-)

[31-Oct-19 06:03 PM] vogelfreund88#4534

If only I wasn't also working. Could have dedicated more time haha

[31-Oct-19 06:04 PM] Gordon Freeman#4502
This is frustrating, not a single swap. Tried for more than 3 hours. Sad.

[31-Oct-19 06:05 PM] Monstar#8630
Hi guys, do the Timeouts also count in?

[31-Oct-19 06:05 PM] Flint#6435
By the way, I once changed the VPN gateway - I dont know if this affected the event shortly before the end

[31-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Flint#6435
maybe taken into account - testers themselves do not yet know what to consider and what not😁

The leaderboard is not reflecting my swaps. 
And how are we taken into account if we had only 1/3 confirmations?

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] cezo484#5810
Finished?

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
im glad I at least got 1 swap in earlier

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@t1 it's enough to be logged by servers.

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] cezo484#5810
9 swap 👍👍👍

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] Flint#6435
yes

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Tomorrow we'll collect all the data we can (data about failed swaps as well) - for now in case of succesful swaps not counted in the dashboard feel free to send logs to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator to be sure that it's counted

[31-Oct-19 06:08 PM] cezo484#5810
When Will distribution +?

[31-Oct-19 06:09 PM] Flint#6435
@cezo484  are you a hacker😄

[31-Oct-19 06:10 PM] modereck#4269
only 1 swap 😦

[31-Oct-19 06:10 PM] cezo484#5810
