someone tried using tor vpn and atomicdex worked fine with it

[19-Nov-19 06:44 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I will / can Send APK to my suppliers if they can use it ....they will

[19-Nov-19 06:52 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Hmm.....how do I get a legit APK?

[19-Nov-19 06:54 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Businesses would use this instead of Western Union or ACH / WT

[19-Nov-19 06:55 PM] SHossain#0007
download to your phone first and use another app to save it your internal storage and share

[19-Nov-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why would atomicdex be blocked by chinese firewall?

[19-Nov-19 06:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
then they would need to ban the ip adresses of all peers?

[19-Nov-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
there are plenty apk extractor app available on play store https://play.google.com/store/search?q=apk%20extractor

[19-Nov-19 06:56 PM] SHossain#0007
also, VPN and TOR works

[19-Nov-19 06:57 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'm sure most factories use vpns already

[19-Nov-19 06:58 PM] phm87#7395
I confirm for the company I worked with (EVS in 2015)

[19-Nov-19 07:01 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok...I'll see if he uses iOS or android....

[19-Nov-19 07:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Absolutely positive ALL of my suppliers would use it....

Does anyone know if the issues currently reported at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues are still being read and considered? It used to be the recommended platform for us beta-testers to report issues, but it seems the recently reported issues have not been noticed/commented (I actually posted some).

So I've tried to send BTC out of atomicDEX to kraken, trezor, and eclair wallet and every time I get an "error try again latet" message. Are those all segwit only services? What legacy wallet can I send to?

[19-Nov-19 11:38 PM] lost_souls_club#8354
Should I just convert it all to KMD, send that out and convert on an exchange to what I want  later?

[19-Nov-19 11:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bittrex has legacy

[19-Nov-19 11:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Chameleon wallet too

[20-Nov-19 12:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can send to chameleon and send from chameleon to kraken.   Segwit address support is in future plans sorry for the inconvienence

When it's out of beta

[20-Nov-19 08:38 AM] Oszy#5734

Any stable based orders to buy kmd seems like there is none

[20-Nov-19 02:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @siu - Chainmakers had some orders up to buy DAI with kmd

[20-Nov-19 04:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Download it

[20-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Torankoku#4818
why do i have to download it to see the assets listed?

[20-Nov-19 04:14 PM] Torankoku#4818
it should be listed to let users know before they decide to download it

[20-Nov-19 04:18 PM] Torankoku#4818
someone should list the 25 assets the komodo blog says the dex has on the website or something

Noob question: do the swaps on the atomicdex app make use of the komodonetwork or is it completely independent of each other?

[20-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
does not rely on komodo network, is it's own separate off chain network

[20-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
barely a "network", just a way to get two peers connected reliably

[20-Nov-19 06:14 PM] atlas#9008
So no need for kmdcoins to do the swaps?

[20-Nov-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
don't need KMD

[20-Nov-19 06:17 PM] atlas#9008
Thanks

One additional question: is atomicdex a protocol or an app or both? I mean can anyone build an app that can do swaps with the 'atomicdex protocol'?

[20-Nov-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Marketmaker 2.0 is the engine. Atomicdex is the chassis

[20-Nov-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You are the driver

[20-Nov-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Mm2.0 is open source I believe, check documentation

[20-Nov-19 08:37 PM] atlas#9008
@Cryptoon ok, thanks. Was just wondering how censorship resistent doing swaps is?

[20-Nov-19 08:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How do you mean? If its possible to ban peers?

[20-Nov-19 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
as censorship resistant as a normal tx on the respective blockchains

I'm trying to install <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/> on ubuntu 16.04,
```sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install build-essential
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
1
  stable installed - rustc 1.39.0 (4560ea788 2019-11-04)
source $HOME/.cargo/env```
I encountered an error after the following command
```rustup install nightly-2019-10-06
info: syncing channel updates for 'nightly-2019-10-06-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu'
info: latest update on 2019-10-06, rust version 1.40.0-nightly (787005079 2019-10-04)
error: some components unavailable for download for channel nightly-2019-10-06: 'clippy', 'rustfmt'
If you require these components, please install and use the latest successful build version,
which you can find at <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history>.

After determining the correct date, install it with a command such as:

    rustup toolchain install nightly-2018-12-27

Then you can use the toolchain with commands such as:

    cargo +nightly-2018-12-27 build```
I tried the following command but I encountered the same problem:
```rustup update nightly```
How can I fix my problem ?

[20-Nov-19 10:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@phm87 looks like you don't have any problem - it's just info prints

[20-Nov-19 10:02 PM] TonyL#3577
```rustup install nightly-2019-10-06
rustup default nightly-2019-10-06
rustup component add rustfmt-preview


cargo clean 
cargo build --features native -vv
```

[20-Nov-19 10:02 PM] TonyL#3577
just try to execute these commands to build

[20-Nov-19 10:03 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know which version of nightly of rust I can use, I've never used rust before today. I'll try with your commands thank you

[20-Nov-19 10:04 PM] jorian#4555
that's really all there is to do. if you're on macos, some additional step might be involved

[20-Nov-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
first command return info prints but also an ``error: some components unavailable for download for channel nightly-2019-10-06: 'clippy', 'rustfmt'``

[20-Nov-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
I'm on ubuntu

[20-Nov-19 10:04 PM] jorian#4555
then just build, it should all be fine

[20-Nov-19 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
```cargo clean
error: could not find `Cargo.toml` in `/home/administrator` or any parent directory```

[20-Nov-19 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
well, maybe I should git clone the repo and change directory into the folder before doing that

[20-Nov-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
```administrator@uni-prod-web:~/atomicDEX-API$ cargo clean
error: failed to parse manifest at `/home/administrator/atomicDEX-API/Cargo.toml`

Caused by:
  the cargo feature `profile-overrides` requires a nightly version of Cargo, but this is the `stable` channel
See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html for more information about Rust release channels.```

[20-Nov-19 10:10 PM] phm87#7395
ok it is working now, I had to do this:
```git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/
cd atomicDEX-API
rustup install nightly
rustup override set nightly

cargo clean 
cargo build --features native -vv``` I needed to add ``rustup install nightly
 rustup override set nightly`` and now the build seems to build

[20-Nov-19 10:18 PM] TonyL#3577
hmm, but after `rustup install nightly` you getting not exactly `nightly-2019-10-06`

When I had building issue instead of `cargo build --features native -vv` I just used `cargo build` and it did it.

[21-Nov-19 02:00 PM] keda666#1678
any beginner user guide? I have 2 orders but I closed my app, will it get match automatically?

[21-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Oszy#5734
not if you close the app

[21-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Oszy#5734
iOS or Android?

[21-Nov-19 02:02 PM] keda666#1678
iOS

[21-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Oszy#5734
then you'll have to keep the app open , and the screen on

[21-Nov-19 02:02 PM] keda666#1678
üòÑ

[21-Nov-19 02:03 PM] Oszy#5734
it's peer to peer swap, not a centralized orderbook.

[21-Nov-19 02:03 PM] Oszy#5734
if there is no peer there is no swap

[21-Nov-19 02:05 PM] keda666#1678
why can't it just push noticfication me when thats a match?

[21-Nov-19 02:05 PM] Oszy#5734
1) because it's beta now
2) because Apple

[21-Nov-19 02:05 PM] keda666#1678
so android work?

[21-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Oszy#5734
on android you can leave the app running in the background and it matches trades yes

[21-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Oszy#5734
notifications will be added later

I found an error creating a transaction in atomicDEX when I try to exchange several coins, in particular 10kmd for QUTUM, the transaction does not work, but when I change the same 10 coins individually 10 times in a row, everything happens

[21-Nov-19 03:12 PM] Oszy#5734
You mean the order doesn't match?

[21-Nov-19 03:14 PM] Oszy#5734
In that case always try to swap a little bit less than the max available amount
