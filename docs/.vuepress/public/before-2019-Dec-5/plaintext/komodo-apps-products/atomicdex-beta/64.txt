Update of iOS, AtomicDEX logged out, logged in, smartphone restarted, problem not fixed. My orders are not saved and swaps are not executed. 3 different networks, same problem everywhere

[16-Sep-19 08:24 AM] Seko#7408
On Twitter there is another user who suggests to have the same problem. No one else with the problem?

[16-Sep-19 08:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
just installed on iOS, eth syncing 8mil txs. is there any trick to enable background operation?

[16-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Seko#7408
@TonyL A reinstallation of the app has solved the problem.

[16-Sep-19 08:36 AM] Seko#7408
But now the history is deleted. Pity...

[16-Sep-19 08:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
ahh, it does run in the background when checking notifications and taking pics, very nice.

[16-Sep-19 08:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
great job guys! this looks awesome.

[16-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Oszy#5734
@Seko  reinstall always fixes it, but will happen again after a failed or timeout swap. I have same problem. Anyhoo, your orders are there you just can't see em'.

[16-Sep-19 08:47 AM] Seko#7408
Yeah, I also think the orders are still there, I'm afraid so, but I can't see them. All the more serious the bug. If the orders still exist, I can neither cancel nor view them.

[16-Sep-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL are we able to reproduce this one? it seems a serious bug

[16-Sep-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
We're trying to reproduce this one: creating synthetic situations with both maker/taker swaps failed on different devices, performing a lot of swaps as a makers - but no luck yet unfortunately

[16-Sep-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
@Oszy could you please send the fresh adb log?

[16-Sep-19 09:00 AM] Oszy#5734
yes, weekend was super busy didn't get to  my pc to do the log üòÑ

[16-Sep-19 09:06 AM] ca333#0118
@Seko - can you please share device information, OS version, net-carrier, environment info (wifi or 4g?,...)etc. with me through DM - will try to reproduce this one. None of our testers has been able yet.

[16-Sep-19 09:12 AM] Seko#7408
Before I had iOS 12.4, but it worked fine. I swapped KMD vs. VRSC for example. Suddenly it didn‚Äôt work anymore. WiFi, 3G, VPN, other networks. Always the same problem...

Maybe we need the new release so that Dev¬¥s can better reproduce the problem via the extended logging function.

Hello. By accepting EULA and TOS... clicking button accept.... seems like "Encrypting wallet" process does not work... its taking 5 minutes and nothing happen.... still in "Encrypting wallet"

[16-Sep-19 01:19 PM] fazer#0903
turning off on application asking me for password... and also "Decrypting wallet" process seems like taking 3 minutes with no result

[16-Sep-19 01:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Hello @fazer ! Try to start wallet creation process again. In next patch encryption process will be reworked with better compatibility

[16-Sep-19 01:33 PM] fazer#0903
@TonyL thanks, i was trying multiple times with same result

[16-Sep-19 01:34 PM] fazer#0903

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #92 Unable to get past the new seed phrase screen
On a Samsung Galaxy S8, I'm unable to complete the new wallet creation since it doesn't make it past the new seed phrase screen.  I'm probably unable to scroll to see a button that should let me proceed.

technically it is possible, but it would need to be coded?

[16-Sep-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
I think that there are some kind of proxies that can transform their api to sth normal

[16-Sep-19 04:50 PM] phm87#7395
I don t find the link, I will send it later

[16-Sep-19 04:59 PM] cipi#4502
it also needs to be integrated in https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx, else no mobile use possible (i don't think the wallet will run on a phone)

[16-Sep-19 05:11 PM] liqdmetal#8650
if we let privacy go, we are shooting ourselves in the foot

[16-Sep-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
use atomicDEX to go through PIRATE and you gain back most of the privacy

[16-Sep-19 05:12 PM] PTYX#6840
@liqdmetal less than 0.5% of people used the privacy features in KMD

[16-Sep-19 05:13 PM] liqdmetal#8650
there will be more and more value to privacy features. if you dont think the end of crypto is the taxation of every transaction...

[16-Sep-19 05:13 PM] PTYX#6840
possibly, but the numbers don't lie

[16-Sep-19 05:13 PM] PTYX#6840
it's a non-issue at this moment in time

[16-Sep-19 05:14 PM] liqdmetal#8650
pirate is on atomicdex?

[16-Sep-19 05:14 PM] PTYX#6840
there's other tools that can be used for privacy

[16-Sep-19 05:14 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i think the need for privacy will grow.  it is a necessity for a relatively free society

[16-Sep-19 05:15 PM] PTYX#6840
ok

[16-Sep-19 05:29 PM] liqdmetal#8650
you seem to have a short term view

[16-Sep-19 05:29 PM] liqdmetal#8650
how many users did bitcoin have to start

[16-Sep-19 05:36 PM] Andersen#8337
You  can  swap  any  privacy  coin  to KMD  ,  and  swap back  again.  Just  use AtomicDEX @liqdmetal

[16-Sep-19 05:37 PM] PTYX#6840
@liqdmetal if kmd had kept it's privacy features we'd be delisted from major exchanges just like other privacy coins have. the decision to remove those features was made by james and it was a smart decision.

[16-Sep-19 05:38 PM] PTYX#6840
it makes more sense to keep KMD as a transparent chain and use privacy features through other methods. possibly even a side chain

[16-Sep-19 05:38 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i was more strictly talking about the dex including privacy coins, not about the public mature of kmd chain

there's no issues with the dex supporting privacy coins

[16-Sep-19 05:39 PM] PTYX#6840
it already does

[16-Sep-19 05:40 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin would be a worthy addition

[16-Sep-19 05:41 PM] PTYX#6840
i'll reach out to grin to ask about integration. there's the question of compatibility and listing fees.

[16-Sep-19 05:42 PM] PTYX#6840
in regards to privacy, what can grin do that pirate cant?

[16-Sep-19 05:44 PM] mammothine#5849
Pirate is way easier to use than Grin

[16-Sep-19 05:45 PM] liqdmetal#8650
lightweight, good privacy features, nochain records to snoop, very fast sync time. pretty good privacy and scalability

[16-Sep-19 05:46 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i am new to pirate coin, but i am learning.  grin has good community support that i know of

[16-Sep-19 05:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
how private is this atomicdex system

[16-Sep-19 05:53 PM] mammothine#5849
It seems it's as private as the coins you'd be swapping

[16-Sep-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue that i have not heard a clear solution to with mimblewimble, is that all the transactions are in plaintext for the miners

[16-Sep-19 05:55 PM] Andersen#8337
Unpopular question: if old  school private coins are delisted , or close to it, why is there no talk about delisting  GRIN  ?

[16-Sep-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it gets big enough, they will

[16-Sep-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
unless they dont mind as all the transactions are in plaintext in the govt archives

[16-Sep-19 05:57 PM] buralux#1776

GRIN

[16-Sep-19 06:43 PM] liqdmetal#8650
any network with enough sniffers on it is compromised, be it TOR or grin

[16-Sep-19 06:43 PM] liqdmetal#8650
de-anonymized

[16-Sep-19 06:45 PM] liqdmetal#8650
the network itself is critical to true anonymity

[16-Sep-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
you miss my point. GRIN transactions are effectively encrypted in the blockchain form, but all the miners get plaintext transaction details. granted, still some work is needed to correlate things, but without any encryption layer, it is all in plaintext.

[16-Sep-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
compare that to the zcash transactions (that are not taddr), the entire transaction is encrypted, before it gets to the miner. so add all the sniffers you want, without the privkey, you wont be able to decrypt the zcash z-transaction

[16-Sep-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case, the network is not so critical and that is the big advantage of z transactions. also with PIRATE, the user cant make a transparent transaction, which is how most of the privacy is lost. by preventing the users from doing transparent tx, the highest level of privacy is maintained

[16-Sep-19 06:59 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i dont believe i did. the miners of grin only receive the aggregated transaction details with no addresses. therefore enough nodes needs to be sniffer nodes to de-anonymize anything

[16-Sep-19 07:00 PM] liqdmetal#8650
assuming a good number of transactions

[16-Sep-19 07:02 PM] liqdmetal#8650
no system is perfect as far as anonymity goes

[16-Sep-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, what does it cost to run a sniffer node? or 1000?

[16-Sep-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
please tell me how you will deanonymize zcash transactions, if all you have are z -> z transactions

[16-Sep-19 07:06 PM] liqdmetal#8650
ive acknowledged it is a weakness, im not pushing an agenda here

[16-Sep-19 07:30 PM] liqdmetal#8650
zksnarks are obviously not as scalable. you are mighty defensive though

pros and cons to all approaches

[16-Sep-19 07:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
when and if grin is able to be transferred without both send/receive wallets being online it may have some utility. it's an apples and oranges argument that belongs somewhere else maybe #talk-other-topics

[16-Sep-19 07:40 PM] liqdmetal#8650
heh, dont you have to broadcast the transaction with all coins?

[16-Sep-19 07:48 PM] Andersen#8337
being online

[16-Sep-19 07:55 PM] liqdmetal#8650
you dont have to be online when the tx is sent to receive it with grin

[16-Sep-19 07:56 PM] liqdmetal#8650
obviously you must send/receive data for all coins. grin is unique at the moment with no addresses

I'm very excited about AtomicDEX and have done a successful trade with an open offer, buying KMD with BCH

[16-Sep-19 11:14 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Today I sent some BTC into my AtomicDEX and attempted to create an offer to sell some for USDC, however I'm unable to do this and am wondering what I'm doing wrong.

but I cannot.,

[16-Sep-19 11:20 PM] allbits#5898
You need ETH in your account to trade USDC because it is an ERC20 and there are gas fees

[16-Sep-19 11:21 PM] allbits#5898
Also when trading BTC Atomicdex imposes a minimum because btc transaction fees are relatively high

[17-Sep-19 12:25 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
ahh, an error message with that info would be handy in a future update
