7.1.1

[12-Sep-19 04:50 PM] dan.#2473
its been broken for a while, havent reported until now

[12-Sep-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, problem was exactly with Android 7.1.1 - specific for this OS version

[12-Sep-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
so you should be fine in the next patch

[12-Sep-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
``seems i can not paste an adress on android` @groundhog is it happening after you fold your application on sending page and restoring it back? can you try to return back to the dashboard and paste address then?

[12-Sep-19 04:51 PM] dan.#2473
thanks tony

[12-Sep-19 04:51 PM] dan.#2473
when is that dropping?

[12-Sep-19 04:51 PM] dan.#2473
can i possibly grab a release apk from anywhere?

[12-Sep-19 04:52 PM] dan.#2473
i know there isn;t, but is there open order books anywhere yet?

[12-Sep-19 04:52 PM] dan.#2473
like atomixexplorer used to have for mm1

[12-Sep-19 04:53 PM] TonyL#3577
@groundhog I've faced similar problems with address pasting while ago, will re-check it's behaviour, will recheck it on my side. Can't reproduce problem with password cursor moving/pasting. On what page are you facing it?

[12-Sep-19 04:53 PM] groundhog#0062
would really halp for testing if there was an option to switch off password and pin usage üò´

[12-Sep-19 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
you can turn off the pin in settings, but password turnoff is super insecure

[12-Sep-19 04:54 PM] groundhog#0062
solved the problem by deleting and reinstalling the app

[12-Sep-19 04:55 PM] groundhog#0062
didnt test the old wallet tho

[12-Sep-19 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
```i know there isn;t, but is there open order books anywhere yet?
like atomixexplorer used to have for mm1```  there is prototype made by @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/ (not showing orderbook but possible to find current best price and depth)

-Can not correct pw when logging in while setting cursor via touchscreen, only del works
-Dex swaps show ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù but don‚Äôt get broadcasted ( resolved after reinstall, on old and newly created wallet) 
-Can‚Äôt paste rick address in send
-Would be nice to scan screenshots no?
-Logging off also toggles me out of the app.
-After sending 5 mortys to another dress it has shown -10 mortys for about a minute
-On my first wallte after relog-in: rick and morty wallets are not shown, but on the second wallet they are shown.
-would be cool if for testing password could be disabled.

@gcharang could you please help to collect actual logs / info / reproducion steps for problem mentioned above ^^ Looks like not good and massive issue affecting expereience of being a maker on mobile.

I've got one very good log from Oszy ~month ago. Would be great to check if current problem symphtoms remained the same because code was refactored a lot since this time. Still got no luck to reproduce on any of my testing devices üò¶

@AkiraX not directly
you could use the seed in Ocean wallet to get privkeys

Soni wouldn't need. To send funds on my phone

[13-Sep-19 01:21 PM] gcharang#6833
you can convert seed created by atomicDEX to privkey uisng ocean wallet

[13-Sep-19 02:38 PM] Markus#5464
@gcharang maybe make a priv key to seed and other way at login screen of atomic dex? üòÉ

[13-Sep-19 02:56 PM] gcharang#6833
Privkey to seed is not possible 
but the other way is definitely possible and in the wish list
All these qol improvements will be added before the official release for sure

@IamTrader atomicDEX uses mixed case addresses for ETH. they have error detection builtin
it seems like your exchange doesn't support mixed case addresses yet
you can simply convert all the alphabet to lower case and submit
convert to lower: <http://www.convertstring.com/StringFunction/ToLowerCase>
mixed case vs all lower: <https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289992-Why-Some-Addresses-Are-Mixed-Case>
```
For example, address 0x6eaff3479c17b8e7a0069823dc87bab09fbf4549 is valid, but 0x6eAff3479c17b8e7A0069823DC87bAB09fBf4549 is easier to copy down safely.

@TonyL  updated issue #86

[14-Sep-19 02:01 PM] PTYX#6840
there's a user complaining on telegram about ```Still experiencing the endless connection screen on the new atomic dex. I 'm using a HUAWEI MediaPad M3 Lite 10, but same problem with a Samsung s8. I was in touch few weeks ago with tony from Discord but he wasn't able to find the problem with my app logs. Great. For the record, during the beta phase I was able tl use the dex. Performed several swap. But since an update, I m stuck on the connection screen```

[14-Sep-19 02:41 PM] Cryptosaurus#2742
I have the same issue, think it is a issue on some devices with android 7. Should be fixed again on next update...

Possibly, I remember we had this issue with the S7 but it was fixed

Hello how do i switch to atomicdex language in english

[15-Sep-19 09:24 AM] ca333#0118
AtomicDEX automatically uses the system language - in order to change it to english you have to change your phone language in the general settings. However - we will add a "manual language selection" feature soon.

Trying to withdraw btc. Says "error try again later"???

[15-Sep-19 10:32 PM] TonyL#3577
@marktyler please ensure that you're using non segwit address as recepient, only p2pkh addresses are suported by protocol at the moment

[15-Sep-19 10:39 PM] marktyler#0324
The sending address starts with a "3" is there more to it?

[15-Sep-19 10:40 PM] marktyler#0324
Sorry i meant receiving address

[15-Sep-19 10:43 PM] TonyL#3577
`3` or `bc1` thats segwit. Legacy addresses starting from `1` - you need to specify such address as a receiving address

[16-Sep-19 12:07 AM] marktyler#0324
So i need to use an address that starts with 1?

[16-Sep-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, thats correct

[16-Sep-19 05:35 AM] Seko#7408

In the next patch will be implemented more detailed logging so I think we‚Äôll hunt it down fast. Is there anything specific happened before this issue appeared? What is your phone model / Android version? @Seko

[16-Sep-19 07:49 AM] Seko#7408
iPhone 6s, iOS 12.4 and DEX 0.1.7. Nothing specific happened. I wanted to make a swap between KMD and VRSC, then I‚Äôm first of three steps the swap was confirmed. Afterwards nothing worked anymore. The same with a second and third swap and I cannot create any more orders since then. They‚Äôre not saved anymore.

[16-Sep-19 07:52 AM] Seko#7408
I cannot create a new order nor will existing order by executed.

[16-Sep-19 07:53 AM] Seko#7408
Until yesterday it was possible.

[16-Sep-19 08:04 AM] Acura#2748
@Seko maybe you try to update ios to 12.4.1

[16-Sep-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
If it worked before and then suddenly stopped to work unlikely OS update will help. You can try to "Settings -> Logout" and then login or reinstall app to see if it helps
