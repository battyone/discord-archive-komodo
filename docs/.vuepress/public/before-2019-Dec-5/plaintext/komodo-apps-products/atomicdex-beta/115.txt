@Arno it was just a bad ux flow
there is no technical reason for such a thing
the backend (mm2) does show available orders without adding funds

[13-Nov-19 12:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think it is a feature that will be added in later iterations

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #127 Impossible to view one's order in the context of other orders
Let's say I have only KMD in my atomicDEX wallet and want to trade it for ETH. Let's say I'll look at the available orders and decide that the offers do not satisfy me. So I decide to create an order myself and want to see "the other way round" which offerings there are already, so what would be a reasonable price for me to offer. So I return to the trade tab, pretend I would sell ETH for KMD (where in reality I want to do it the other way round), just to see the order book. At this point, th...

how do I read this order? 390 sats each? :p

4908 sats 😛

Hi! Im trying to withdraw ethereum but when i put the address tells me "invalid address" i checked if have "eth:" or something similar at the begining of the address but no, but still showing me invalid address

[13-Nov-19 04:35 PM] Oszy#5734
I think it may be case sensitive? is the address you have all lowercase?

[13-Nov-19 04:36 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Yes, all lowercase

[13-Nov-19 04:37 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
This is the address 

0x60d66ebed042f60120b552bee8f6c9e2af7d81d5

[13-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Oszy#5734
Do you have the non-lowercase version of this address?

[13-Nov-19 04:58 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
No, its from a exchange and its the only showed

[13-Nov-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
@FtrSaroth `0x60D66eBED042f60120b552bEE8f6c9e2af7d81D5` mixed-case version - this one should work for you

[13-Nov-19 05:02 PM] TonyL#3577
https://etherscan.io/address/0x60d66ebed042f60120b552bee8f6c9e2af7d81d5 It's generating on etherscan lets say `Contract 0x60D66eBED042f60120b552bEE8f6c9e2af7d81D5`

sorry if asked already

[13-Nov-19 07:22 PM] gigamesh#3544
why no USDT?

[13-Nov-19 07:41 PM] gigamesh#3544
does any team member wish to address this question before i publish?

[13-Nov-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
last i heard, the USDT erc20 contract is not compatible

[13-Nov-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and most of the USDT is some strange omni protocol if i remember right

[13-Nov-19 08:01 PM] gigamesh#3544
ty @jl777c

[13-Nov-19 08:02 PM] gigamesh#3544
are there are plans to USDT in future?

[13-Nov-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they will update their erc20 to a more standard form, maybe some other variant could be supported. with all the stablecoins supported, not sure USDT is a high priority

[13-Nov-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but it isnt up to me

[13-Nov-19 08:08 PM] gigamesh#3544
so OMNI not supported by DEX?

[13-Nov-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not now. not sure OMNI supports CLTV and hashlocks

[13-Nov-19 08:21 PM] gigamesh#3544
is this acceptable:

[13-Nov-19 08:21 PM] gigamesh#3544
``Notable by its absence is the beleaguered Tether (USDT), whose operations are being investigated by the NYAG. However, according to a source close to the project the omission is more likely due to USDT's non-standard ERC-20 contract which is incompatible with AtomicDEX. Additionally the platform lacks support for OMNI assets.``

[13-Nov-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure tether is beleaguered, they seem to be doing fine

[13-Nov-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why make any big deal out of it, it isnt supported due to technical reasons, nothing else.

[13-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For now, the platform lacks support for OMNI assets.

What are the requirements to be listed on AtomicDEX? Just posing the question here as there’s been an interest from another privacy coin. Thanks!

[14-Nov-19 04:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
What privacy mechanism does it use ?

[14-Nov-19 04:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Cryptonote and MW will require a good bit of work on their end to make it work .  Optional privacy coins shouldn’t be an issue.    There is a fee for the GUI integration as well

[14-Nov-19 04:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It depends on the difficulty of the chain

[14-Nov-19 04:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bitcoin based = easiest  Custom mechanism = hardest

[14-Nov-19 07:04 AM] Mark81#4505
Improvment sucestion: when choosing ie. Kmd and next to which  coin to trade it might be good to atleast show coin ticker next to icon since when all coins are enabled its very hard to start quessing what is that ie. Pax coin if not familiar with icons.

[14-Nov-19 01:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
When is there gonna be a BNB-like solution for all the dust? Got like 10 dollars worth of dust spread over 5 coins. Would be nice to be able to swap them with 1 button click to the best KMD offer or something

[14-Nov-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine somebody would need to setup a service for such a thing, it is not really atomic swaps

[14-Nov-19 01:39 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Isnt that the same as 5 little swaps (but automated to look for best offer with all 5 KMD pairs)?

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you overlook that dust amounts vs txfee for coins are rather large

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Oszy#5734
if it's "dust" it may not be eligible for the minimum trade amount ofo 0.00777

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] Oszy#5734
+tx fee

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and incurring the cost for swap is not worth it

[14-Nov-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
however someone might offer a service of you sending them dust amounts in N different coins and sending back some KMD

[14-Nov-19 01:42 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ah ok yeah i forgot about that. Well its quite annoying to have dust laying around allthough the dollarvalue is low. Maybe its my OCD that i dont like those odds numbers

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #128 Incomplete / incorrect German translation \- suggestions
Here are some suggestions from me as a native German guy with lots of GUI design experience:

Portfolio Tab: 
- Replace "n Assets" by "n Vermögenswerte".
- Replace "Claim your rewards" by "Belohnung einfordern", or "Lohn einfordern" (if too long).

DEX Tab:
- Replace "transaction fee" by "Transaktionsgebühr".
- Replace "trading fee" by "Handelsgebühr".
- Replace the big "HANDEL" button (to start the trade) by "Ausführen". Because "(der) Handel" means "(the) trade". "to trade" (infini...

A user asks if there is already an external audit for Market Maker V2?

He also asks if the order matching is "on-chain" ? 
He could not completely understand it so far.

[14-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
order matching is p2p

[14-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how can it be on chain if there are 2 different chains?

[14-Nov-19 05:42 PM] Acura#2748
@gcharang maybe you can answer that too ?

[14-Nov-19 05:50 PM] gcharang#6833
there hasn't been an external audit on mm2 yet
it is still in development and new features constantly added
it will definitely have an audit before full public release

>  if the order matching is "on-chain" ? 
it is not on-chain, it is better than that: fully p2p
every mm2 instance creates its own local orderbook based on the orders it hears on the network
more info: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>

> how can it be on chain if there are 2 different chains?
on-chain happens in proxy token DEXs; it is better than some DEXs that follow a similar protocol as ours but use a centralised orderbook like a website

ours is better than both of the above cases as it is completely p2p and works with home desktops, mobiles with 3g/4g/wifi etc.,

anyway i'm done researching this. atomic swaps were removed "months ago", but not from their website, twitter or other PR material

[15-Nov-19 03:03 AM] gigamesh#3544
personally i think its unprofessional or just lazy, esp. given they still publish testimonials associated with the DEX (Shrem)

[15-Nov-19 03:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomic swaps will be used for things not typically conceived .

[15-Nov-19 04:00 AM] allbits#5898
Do you have examples?

[15-Nov-19 04:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

[15-Nov-19 04:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
People who are doing big transactions with exchange otc desks likely wont care about atomic swaps via mm2 until they understand how much they could save on fees and by cutting out middlemen.                     They likely already have bulletproof legal entities in crypto friendly countries and dont have to worry about door kickers and alphabet agency extortion.
