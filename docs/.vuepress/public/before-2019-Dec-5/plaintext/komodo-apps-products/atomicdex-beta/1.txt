0.0005 will be too low because the tx fee for the RICK/MORTY chains is 0.0005.

[03-Jun-19 04:40 AM] Mylo#8306
you can't swap nothing basically

[03-Jun-19 04:41 AM] Mylo#8306
0.00005 tx fee.  sorry

[03-Jun-19 04:44 AM] Mylo#8306
wrong again.   default 0.0001 tx fee.   apologies.

i don't know why it wouldn't trade 0.01

@ca333 
1) After I press `logout`in settings I get to my phone screen instead of login screen. 
2) Also AtomicDEX asking me to create PIN every time I login to wallet with saved (created by AtomicDEX) seed
when i put the application to background / open it - it asking me to `Input` pin, but when I logout and login to my saved wallet from login page it asking me to `Create` pin

As I understand electrum dont like low amount sums (or this error means that app started to "DDoS" electrum):

[03-Jun-19 06:16 AM] ca333#0118
@TonyL - 
1) on logout event we shut down mm2 and the app. fyi - We added this with the last release. 
2) shossain reported it already - this will be changed with next release. We will store the PIN encrypted with pw too.
3) thanks - we will add exception handler for "history too large" response

waiting for a swap to finish, to test this again.

**WRONG** was the graphic of the "Awesome Post" slow to load.  **Can ignore**

1.  News "Check back later" in bottom half of screen
2. Gpt to News Saved.   Nothing saved.  Tap "Browse" to go back to news feed
3. News feed in bottom half of screen.
4.  Go to other tab (DEX for example)
5.  Go back to news tab, full screen.

**Unbookmarking Modal**

1. Unbookmarking a saved article, would be nice to have a confirmation modal, otherwise fat fingers might lose articles (or some kind of undo)

@modereck Hi! @SHossain will recheck it 

Thanks for logs - I can notice such `Error creating RaiiRm("/data/local/tmp/lt-dht-4861232908906222768.tmp"): Permission denied (os error 13)` in my logs too - so maybe it's a cause/symphtom

[04-Jun-19 12:59 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
on `view seed` page - 
it says `COPY THEN TO YOUR CLIPBOARD`
maybe remove `THEN / YOUR` so its just `COPY TO CLIPBOARD`

had this a couple times. steps to reproduce - 
click `max`, then click camera and scan qr code, then click `withdraw`

[04-Jun-19 01:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
works ok if input gets `focus`

[04-Jun-19 01:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've seen same thing on web forms, where app doesnt detect change without input being activate by clicking on

[04-Jun-19 01:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
issue doesnt happen every time, sometimes it sends without issue
