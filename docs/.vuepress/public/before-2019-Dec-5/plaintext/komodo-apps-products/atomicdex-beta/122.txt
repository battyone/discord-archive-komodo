So if a coin supports that a coin could be spent no earlier than a given height, but however not a date. It could be added?

[28-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Oszy#5734
If the utxo can be locked for certain time yes

[28-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Oszy#5734

If I failed to swap, then I may lose the taker fee(0.11%)?

[29-Nov-19 10:53 AM] gcharang#6833
yes @saturday

[29-Nov-19 10:53 AM] saturday#4156
that's unfair

[29-Nov-19 10:54 AM] saturday#4156
do you have a plan for payback the failed swap fee?

[29-Nov-19 10:55 AM] gcharang#6833
it is a necessary spam prevention mechanism and as the liquidity improves nd the software matures
failed swaps should be a rare occurance

[29-Nov-19 10:57 AM] saturday#4156
I failed 3 time. It costs more than 3 kmd.

@saturday looks like some bad/non-updated maker placed this order for kmd @20 . Tried to trade with him multiple time and getting timeout on makerpayment each time. It's a huge disappointment to lose taker fee each time, I agree

How long are your funds locked when a swap failed

[29-Nov-19 05:43 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have your taker payment locked inside the failed swap just keep app alive and funds will be returned eventually (usually it taking just few hours for not BTC and not BCH as taker payment)

[29-Nov-19 05:56 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I tried swapping kmd for some dex but it timed out, now it says on the main screen in still got my balance. But when i try to swap that kmd for something else it says that the majority (the amount i tried to swap the dex for) is locked. Its hours since the timed out swap

[29-Nov-19 05:58 PM] phm87#7395
I think that you should wait more than 3 hours. Do not close the app

[29-Nov-19 06:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@CoinKing88 iOS ?

[29-Nov-19 06:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
yeah

[29-Nov-19 06:02 PM] gcharang#6833
you have to make sure the app is open and screen is unlocked for atleast 30 minutes after the lockperiod (3 -4 hours) is over

[29-Nov-19 06:03 PM] gcharang#6833
right now the atomicDEX app on iOS doesn't work in the background
we are working on a fix

[29-Nov-19 06:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540

So if i have 100 DEX, then what? Explain like I'm your grandmama

[29-Nov-19 07:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
You will have 100 of 1 million DEX coins, so you will be eligible for 100/1.000.000th of the fee rewards by users who use the DEX api

[29-Nov-19 08:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
which will be paid out in .. KMD? to the same KMD address that the DEX are held in?

[29-Nov-19 08:07 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[29-Nov-19 08:34 PM] marktyler#0324
The kmd in the dex address, at what point does it payout?

[29-Nov-19 08:37 PM] Markus#5464
@marktyler when the total balance in the fee address reaches 1 mil usd

[29-Nov-19 08:40 PM] hastrup#8742
@marktylerSo that means if the dex api gets to be in the top ten daily volume for an exchange, as of right now that around 1b usd. The fee is around 0.15% so for 1b daily volume you get 1.5 m in fees the dex coin gets 50% of the fee to share in 1m shares, that's 750k so if you got 100 dex coin and the daily wolume is 1b you would get 75 usd rev share for that day. The good think about dex api is everyone can make a gui on top of it So it's not only atomicdex that needs to get to 1b in daily volume but every other dex combine there is about 5+ project right now working on guis for dex api. :)

Not sure if it has been said, but I updated atomicdex and tried to add FTC, feathercoin and couldn't activate it.

[30-Nov-19 02:13 AM] marktyler#0324
Where can you find the daily volume for atomicdex

[30-Nov-19 07:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Where can you find how many times some torrent has been downloaded?

[30-Nov-19 07:27 AM] Oszy#5734
on whatever site you downloaded it from? what do you mean? that number is on the tracker server, how does this relate to atomicdex?

[30-Nov-19 07:32 AM] Mark81#4505
Real P2p networks are not sql servers that save data to central points.

[30-Nov-19 07:35 AM] Oszy#5734
then you also know that real p2p network doesn't count that, you can only see uploaded data , because not all your peers are necessarily downloading all the files from just you.

[30-Nov-19 07:35 AM] Mark81#4505
Its saturated network.
