@gcharang this is what I get with your link, then when I click on the first link (if the AtomicDEX application isnt installed on your device, /donwload it from Google play/)

You need to sign up

[29-Aug-19 06:26 PM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Yeah well I already signed up twice, one on the first day (with a different adress than my Google Play adress - at that time my talks with ca333 and Angelina didn't really helped)  and one 3/4 weeks ago with my google play adress but this time I didn't received a confirmation email like I got the first time. I can PM you the details but if it's too much trouble I can wait, no trouble.

[29-Aug-19 06:53 PM] hastrup#8742
You need to wait for the next batch to get the invite idk when that happens. But eventually you will get your invite

[29-Aug-19 09:42 PM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Thank you @ca333,  after some troubles with the cache and datas of my play store application I finally downloaded the app and my first KMD-VRSC swap worked perfectly
Thank you all for your help :)

Did you have a question about AtomicDEX, @jose 17 ?

[30-Aug-19 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe someone here could help.

[30-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jose 17#6959
@CrisF yes friend here what do I have to do to earn the coin

[30-Aug-19 05:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, good question @jose 17. But this ( #talk-general ) is probably a better place to ask.
Unless you want RICK or MORTY coins.
If you want some of them please post your address. I will send you some.

[30-Aug-19 05:35 AM] jose 17#6959
@CrisF Well, as you know, I don't know anything about it, I don't even know how to do it

[30-Aug-19 05:40 AM] CrisF#3405
What do you want to do? @jose 17

[30-Aug-19 08:18 AM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Posted in the Blocknet discord a few hours ago, I dont really understand what's his problem with the "atomic". Maybe there is some documentation I Can point them to, or something more technical ?
Anyway here's the message :

What's up with nix using atomicdex?   I thought nix was working with blocknet?   Do they know that just because they called it "atomic"dex doesn't really necessarily mean that?

[30-Aug-19 08:24 AM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Oh maybe this particular NIX_KMD swap was not atomic because of their Ghost protocol thing ?

[30-Aug-19 08:32 AM] ca333#0118
@GuilouGuilouOTE  https://www.binance.vision/blockchain/atomic-swaps-explained - there is a sentence in this article stating that (we) jl777 did the worlds first automated cross chain atomic swap - even Binance gave us credit for the worlds first REAL DEX technology which i think says more than thousand words. Furthermore does https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-and-the-early-pioneers-of-atomic-swaps/ explain our DEX history and technology very well. However, rest assured that atomicDEX is the only 3rd generation, platform independent, cross-chain atomic swap technology.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #83 Integrate "recover\_funds\_of\_swap" API\.
I've recently added [API](https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#recover_funds_of_swap) to unstuck the [funds locked by some swaps](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22funds+stuck%22).
Please consider adding the `recover/unstuck` button for failed swaps.
I'm also going to add the `recoverable` field to `swap_status` to help understanding whether swap requires funds recovery or not....

Convenience feature allowing users to copy their swap history between different devices.
Also other use case: user has deleted swap data (app reinstall), but his funds remain stuck. We will send him swap status from seed node, user will import it and then unstuck the funds using `recover_funds_of_swap`.

Testing latest 0.1.62 on Samsung S10 (exynos). First start still rough a little bit. It connects and slowly loads the assets, very sluggish and freezes. Minimizing and opening the app again helps immediately, opens up quickly and working smooth. Only cold start is problematic.
