you can keep repeating it didnt work, ok, we all know that it couldnt handle 250tx/sec sustained, and the degradation of the network was not graceful, it saturated and stopped for most

[02-Nov-19 03:25 PM] duskonaut#1244
just my opinion anyway... you had 2000 people that tried to send 1 transaction for 6 hours.

🤦 (5) 💩 🤢 

[02-Nov-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly it could not handle it

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you keep repeating what everybody knows?

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
mm1 initial stress test was a bit similar

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
that is the entire point of doing these tests

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] duskonaut#1244
Because you keep repeating that test was success

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
by the third iteration, mm1 was able to handle the load

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the test was a success in finding what broke

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] duskonaut#1244
and I did not read other people comments here

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that was the point of the test

[02-Nov-19 03:26 PM] ca333#0118
@duskonaut stop repeating yourself and complaining about others repeating

[02-Nov-19 03:27 PM] duskonaut#1244
great

[02-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Mark81#4505
Is it normal behavior that when maker order gets partially filled and swap fails it get removed from inventory?

I want to say thanks to Komodo as I was a lucky winner.  I participated in the stress test, not expecting to win anything, just hoping, and hoping to help improve this software.  With the on-going creep of government into all aspects of our lives, I think AtomicDex will be an essential tool in fighting for freedom, and will especially fulfill that goal with the implementation of Pirate (ARRR).  Can't wait to help with future tests, and ultimately see this released for the world to use.

thank you for participating and congrats on your winnings 🙂

[02-Nov-19 05:28 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I asked in talk-trading but got no response.  I've seen a breakdown of rewards for different komodo assests including DEX.  Can someone point me to that exhibit/breakdown of what rewards a DEX holder would receive?

[02-Nov-19 05:36 PM] Oszy#5734
@cryptoclueless 
here is the breakdown, https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/429676131726262273/627154140509765648
it has been discussed a few times, try using the search box you may find the conversation you are looking for.

[02-Nov-19 05:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Sugi  thank you for making an Atomicdex video and getting the word out

[02-Nov-19 05:50 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
Thats it Oszy, thanks!  I've seen 1 DEX valued at 20-30 KMD, at least thats what holders are selling them for.  I'm curious if thats based on some estimation of atomicDex transaction fees

[02-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Oszy#5734
right now it's based on nobody really selling it 😄 some say it's worth even 100KMD, it's up to people to valuate it, surely has to look at in as a long term investment

[02-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Oszy#5734
but yes i've seen it between 30-40 in the past months

[02-Nov-19 05:56 PM] Oszy#5734
it's not a bad price now considering KMD is .57 cents not $1.50 as it was a few months ago

[02-Nov-19 05:57 PM] Acura#2748
@cryptoclueless Imagine a Dex that uses multiple GUI's...
Smartphone / Tablet (AtomicDex) + 
Native Web-based Dex

Plus other projects which will create their own GUI (e.g. HyperDex/Chainswap) and use Dex as engine - plus the potential when MM2 is ready incl. Z Address Handling (Pirate) + CEX Orderbook Connection

And not to forget the integration of Dex into existing wallet providers.

Everyone uses one and the same order book.
And you earn money with every trade.

My Point of view.

Thanks Oszy and Acura.  Its exciting to think of that potential, but feels impossible to wait 🙂

[02-Nov-19 06:00 PM] Acura#2748
And upcoming DuneDex is based on AtomicDex i have read ...

[02-Nov-19 06:02 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
yeah, so DEX holders would earn money from that too?

[02-Nov-19 06:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[02-Nov-19 06:03 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
so the question is do I convert the stress test winnings to DEX or stay in KMD, decisions, decisions.  Thanks for your views on this I really appreciate it.

[02-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Oszy#5734
i just wanted to say this 😄 i will

[02-Nov-19 06:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends on your timeframe, DEX will take some time to pay out as everything is early beta for now

[02-Nov-19 06:07 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
@TonyL i was told to send my log to @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator which i did, but did not make the list you posted at 2am lol

[02-Nov-19 06:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Thanks, I have your logs. Will check them and add manually later tonight.

[02-Nov-19 06:19 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I dont think it matters since the reward thing was a 4hr window in the middle of the night  @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[02-Nov-19 06:20 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
And winners anounced already, + i wouldnt have won anything with 3 swaps anywho

[02-Nov-19 06:20 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
All good though. Was fun testing

[02-Nov-19 06:20 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I like breaking stuff lol

[02-Nov-19 06:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm looking anyway, and doing what I can to improve data collection etc. Got a bunch of logs to check, some up to 70MB. Each needs to be cleaned up to only the json, then filtered to only look at swaps during the window. Had a decent sleep today, so getting stuck in.

[02-Nov-19 06:22 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
For that yes, logs r good. Cool zzz

[02-Nov-19 06:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be sending 7.77KMD to all who sent me logs **during** the test 👍🏽

[02-Nov-19 06:24 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Word. I still keep testing it. I want it to work. 
Will it possible to offer a maker position and close the app/lock phone? That would be a HUGE + for me. Unless my phone is plugged in the screen times out

[02-Nov-19 06:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
app needs to be running for swap process to initiate / progress.

[02-Nov-19 06:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a persistent maker would be best on a VPS.

[02-Nov-19 06:26 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Hmm, link to cli/code available?

[02-Nov-19 06:26 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

What's too bad is that my order doesn't stay online when I put it in with the iPhone and I switch the display to standby.

That is an iOS limitation if i know correctly, even on Android it goes off sometimes, I keep the display on with an app (never goes to sleep)

I remember the first 100K or million is not distributed or something?

And practical things: do i need to "stake" my DEX or is just holding them in my wallet enough to get a piece of the DEX fee in the future
