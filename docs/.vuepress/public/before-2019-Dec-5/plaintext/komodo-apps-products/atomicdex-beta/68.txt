Repos:

<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/> --> repo with the backend called Marketmaker 2.0, you can build it and get a CLI to the dex network
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX> --> this is the placeholder repo of the AtomicDEX mobile app, a mobile GUI that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex> --> the repo for the HyperDEX GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/chainmakers/chainmakers-ui-mono-repository/tree/master/packages/atomicdex-app> --> the repo for the Chainswap GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0

As all the UI's use the same backend, "Marketmaker 2.0", they share the same liquidity pool. i.e., an order created in one of them will be seen in all the others
<https://github.com/jl777/coins> --> all the coins in this repo with `"mm2": 1,` in the file named "coins" have been tested to work with Marketmaker 2.0 and any one of the GUI's is able to list them

Sorry if the question has already been answered.

Is there an alarm function for newly set orders for favorite Traidingpairs? Or is something in this direction already planned?

How do i recover funds locked in swaps when there is no active swap for them

@AchtSechs there is no notification/alarm functions right now
we have plans to add notifications for finished swaps etc., 
will take note of this feature too

[20-Sep-19 12:59 PM] gcharang#6833
instead of waiting for others to create orders on your favorite pairs, you could create them with the prices you like
they will stay in the orderbook if you are using android and the app is in background

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] fat3lvis#6079
So on iOS just updated to latest and first it crashed upon opening. Then it opens and my ethereum wallet is gone and ethereum is not available to activate. All other balances are fine.

[20-Sep-19 01:30 PM] demzet#8295
ok, how can i add new coin to atomic dex, where can i find an example of an integration ? ü§î

[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] fat3lvis#6079
New faster animations look good though. And am I right in thinking rotate screen has been locked? That‚Äôs good if so, I always meant to say that the horizontal view was a mess and unnecessary

[20-Sep-19 01:32 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Ah no I just checked BAT is not available either

[20-Sep-19 01:33 PM] fat3lvis#6079
On start up it says ‚Äúsorry eth not available‚Äù then ‚Äúsorry bat not available‚Äù what‚Äôs up with this?

[20-Sep-19 01:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@demzet the coin must be added to this repo <https://github.com/jl777/coins> first
for listing in the app itself, contact @PTYX 
he is a service provider and can help you with the integration

[20-Sep-19 01:34 PM] demzet#8295

Hi, should we still be reporting failed swaps?
I just had a KMD BAT swap after 2nd step.

[20-Sep-19 03:12 PM] CrisF#3405
And another just failed too.

[20-Sep-19 03:13 PM] PTYX#6840
@CrisF definitely, you should report anything that could help the team improve the app

[20-Sep-19 03:13 PM] PTYX#6840
were both swaps kmd/bat?

[20-Sep-19 03:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, tried to sell a BAT for KMD.

[20-Sep-19 03:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Wanted to see how it would go after reading the above messages about IOS not having it available for some people.

[20-Sep-19 03:28 PM] cipi#4502
the swap has not failed, it is still underway... this is MakerPayment: https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/6e01e35cbb8ff986140bf006b17d89171b95392e257b22064cf0a45587ac5e20
next step would be TakerPayment, so your node should make the BAT tx

[20-Sep-19 03:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I received a swap fail message on both of them.

[20-Sep-19 03:32 PM] cipi#4502
interesting... my node still waits for TakerPayment for both of them

[20-Sep-19 03:33 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll post a screenshot.

[20-Sep-19 03:34 PM] cipi#4502

[20-Sep-19 03:36 PM] CrisF#3405

did you run out of ETH for the TakerPayment?

[20-Sep-19 03:40 PM] CrisF#3405
I have a balance of 0.01092715ETH.  Not sure if that is enough or not.

[20-Sep-19 03:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, maybe this?  It says it is loading, Syncing 7160948 transactions!?

[20-Sep-19 03:42 PM] cipi#4502
yes, 0.01 should be enough... fee for the above TakerFee was 0.000958152

[20-Sep-19 03:43 PM] cipi#4502
unfortunately i don't know what the `Syncing 7160948 transactions` message is about

[20-Sep-19 03:44 PM] CrisF#3405
$0.21 transaction fee on a 1BAT swap!  Gas sucks.

[20-Sep-19 04:43 PM] LoveOfMoney#0616
will atomic dex integrate with coinmarketcaps. Bartedex information would not transfer to them so coins did not get credit for being on an exchange.

[20-Sep-19 04:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@LoveOfMoney we will try to get it on CMC once it is out of beta

[20-Sep-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX did eventually get onto CMC, i think we can try to rename it to atomicDEX when there is sufficient volumes

Made this question in telegram group and Acura adviced to ask it here.. So "If we talk about steps that need to be taken regarding Atomic Dex, how does it look? I mean:
‚Ä¢Beta testing phase now
‚Ä¢Liquidity solutions
‚Ä¢Stress tests
‚Ä¢Roll-out @ end of year, i guess?
‚Ä¢What is the strategy for getting as many coins listed as possible?
‚Ä¢And finally will there be marketing or some kinda campaigning towards the release?

Also, how much users are actually wanted / needed now as Atomic Dex is still in beta..? I mean it would be easy to multiply the user amounts right away by spreading some information, interviews and so on. Generally speaking I am interested in the strategy part of Atomic Dex roll-out"

[20-Sep-19 05:12 PM] gcharang#6833
> Liquidity solutions
there is a maker-bot under development that lets anyone be a LP <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/antara-makerbot>
> Stress tests
planned for the coming weeks
> Roll-out @ end of year
‚úÖ 
> What is the strategy for getting as many coins listed as possible?
> And finally will there be marketing or some kinda campaigning towards the release?
the main issue is getting a commitment from a coin community to provide liquidity, there are plans to collab with various coin teams for Promotion and liquidity

[20-Sep-19 05:13 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I only see available orders between btc and kmd, no other coins, is that correct, or do I need to clear cache or uninstall/reinstall to see current order book

[20-Sep-19 05:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptoclueless did you enable other coins? only orders involving enabled coins are shown

[20-Sep-19 05:15 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
yeah, I've enabled a bunch of them

[20-Sep-19 05:16 PM] gcharang#6833
can you tell me the pair you are looking for? I will check in my app

[20-Sep-19 05:17 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I've just tried to see whats available to swap for btc, and I'd have to create an oder for every coin except KMD.  I've enabled bch, axe, qtum, dash, vrsc, ltc, rvn bat, hush, zilla, rfox

[20-Sep-19 05:20 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I also have a little bat, zilla, qtum, rfox, and eth, and again the only available swaps are to kmd

[20-Sep-19 05:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptoclueless there are only KMD orders with BTC as base pair
there are orders for most coins with KMD as base

you could create an order by yourself for a BTC base pair if one isn't there already

[20-Sep-19 05:31 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
Yeah, I know, just surprised no swaps for btc

[20-Sep-19 06:11 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
maybe its because the minimum btc swap amount is 0.00777 which is around 75 dollars, will that minimum amount be lowered at some point?

[20-Sep-19 06:14 PM] gcharang#6833
not anytime soon
there can be times when btc txn fee is $1 
then swapping for less than $70 is more than 1% fee

there might be an option to disable the limit for advanced users in the future

[20-Sep-19 06:14 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
ok, good to know, thanks

[20-Sep-19 06:22 PM] Markus#5464
or make a check, if fee is greater than 1% then make a popup window appear to warn the user

[20-Sep-19 06:54 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Will it eventually be possible to set a minimum level of purchase for my offers?

[20-Sep-19 06:55 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
It appears I can set a maximum that I'm willing to sell, but not the minimum.

[20-Sep-19 06:56 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
That would be a super-useful feature.  Thank you for the promising app - I'm very interested in where this can go.

[20-Sep-19 08:16 PM] wl#4107
Or 10% 20% 100%... Like on some exchanges.

[20-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Seko#7408
I would get some Ether on AtomicDEX. But I'm unsure about this message.

[20-Sep-19 10:24 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Agreed, @wl , I would like to be able to have my offer's price continually update based on the market rate, so I could always have my BTC available at say, 10% above it.

[21-Sep-19 04:28 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF Interesting, both these swaps were failed on TakerTx broadcasting stage with:
`"error": "taker_swap:691] eth:864] eth:864] RPC error: Error { code: ServerError(-32010), message: \"Transaction with the same hash was already imported.\", data: None }"` error. Were there another successful or failed swap attempts with same BAT amount?

[21-Sep-19 06:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Not on this version (0.1.9), @TonyL .  I don't have the data from the previous version.  I did a few rushed trades on that just to see if it was working.  I don't remember if one was the same amount but it is possible.

[21-Sep-19 06:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Would the address be the same between versions?  I can check the explorer.

[21-Sep-19 06:53 AM] Seko#7408
I got a timeout for the swap. Exactly this KMD amount has been locked since then. I can't use exactly this amount of KMD.
