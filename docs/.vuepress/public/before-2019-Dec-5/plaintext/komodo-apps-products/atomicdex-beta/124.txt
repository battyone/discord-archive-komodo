Is there anyway to figure out community backing those coins/tokens?

[02-Dec-19 07:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Might be worth it if there is no additional support costs associated with it.

[02-Dec-19 09:14 AM] zenosama#5371
as I tried XMR cannot be added to atomicDEX, yes? it is not forked from bitcoin protocol and it funds can only be held particulary for a set height of blocks, and not time

[02-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama atomicdex do not allow privacy swaps as of now, therefore not supported but its being developed atm. I read somewhere that it would be ready Q1 2020. Not sure if that includes XMR tho but u will be able to swap Pirate which is more anonymous than XMR

[02-Dec-19 09:16 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus and where could I read about Pirate, to understand why is it more anonymous?

Due to almost instant confirmation times I'm thinking $NANO and $BAN would make good additions to @KomodoPlatform's AtomicDEX

I bought DEX, to receive the eventual dividends can I keep them the in AtomicDex? The dividends are shared in which currency, KMD?

[03-Dec-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and yes

[03-Dec-19 05:11 AM] criptobear#6402
Oh great thx for answering

[03-Dec-19 05:14 AM] criptobear#6402
AtomicDex is so good, when will people realize that?  it needs so much hype to make people see a product, irony is they buy so much shit like crypto ridge and their tokens now everybody in there has to rush a kyc to get back their tokens that in most part are worthless

[03-Dec-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in time, all that will be left standing will be the fully decentralized tech. the rest will either be regulated to death or become subject to govt control, ie. see china

[03-Dec-19 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
might as well use a govt run paypal

Is atomicDEX at risk or it just possibly at risk?

[04-Dec-19 05:04 PM] Oszy#5734
don't think so passphrase is encrypted

[04-Dec-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt it a keylogger?

[04-Dec-19 05:12 PM] Oszy#5734
kind of

[04-Dec-19 05:12 PM] Oszy#5734
but then everything is at risk

[04-Dec-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes,  i think that is the point of strandhogg

[04-Dec-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
banking apps also at risk

[04-Dec-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if you see a login screen that seems a bit off, probably it is strandhogg

[04-Dec-19 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i wonder if that can penetrate KNOX chip on Samsung phones to steal from the sandboxed apps ü§î

[04-Dec-19 05:24 PM] Oszy#5734
How to spot it:
```
An app or service that you‚Äôre already logged into is asking for a login.
Permission popups that does not contain an app name.
Permissions asked from an app that shouldn‚Äôt require or need the permissions it asks for. For example, a calculator app asking for GPS permission.
Typos and mistakes in the user interface.
Buttons and links in the user interface that does nothing when clicked on.
Back button does not work like expected.
```

[04-Dec-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
KNOX works like secured virtual machine which is like Qubes OS. But, users can't copy paste info to/from host. Also, when you run an app from Secure Folder, you can't make any screenshot due to security policy. So, if you use Samsung KNOX for banking or crypto wallet, your funds might be safe. But, still would be open to other vulnerabilities like mic and camera usage by the malware.

[04-Dec-19 05:31 PM] Oszy#5734
only if you give the permission

[04-Dec-19 05:31 PM] Oszy#5734
but why would you give a banking app microphone and camera perms

[04-Dec-19 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
banking app might need camera permission to scan cheques.

[04-Dec-19 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
microphone, not sure why would they

[04-Dec-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
facial recognition kyc is starting

[04-Dec-19 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007
except some mobile ONLY banking apps requires both for first time registration to take picture of your ID docs and record a video proof of your face while reading some words displayed on screen

[04-Dec-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
probably make sure to disable those permissions once you have your mobile bank account opened up

[04-Dec-19 05:33 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah right

[04-Dec-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007

[04-Dec-19 05:43 PM] SHossain#0007
if going back to use dumb phone due to privacy and security, might as well ditch camera, internet and other fancy things in a mobile. just play snake, calls and sms

[04-Dec-19 05:44 PM] SHossain#0007
having a removable battery is must for that

[04-Dec-19 05:44 PM] SHossain#0007
when you want to go totally out of the grid, pull the battery out
