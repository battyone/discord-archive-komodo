fee seems high for a send. can you plsDM the txid?

[14-Aug-19 02:33 PM] Oszy#5734
sent

[14-Aug-19 02:38 PM] Oszy#5734
sorry üòÑ

[14-Aug-19 02:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
perfectly normal, when there are rewards, fee is a negative value :treasure:

[14-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Oszy#5734
my bad and my 4 eyes couldn't see the `-` üòÑ

[14-Aug-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, but it seems that on tx broadcasting with rewards amount displaying not corrent in transaction info

[14-Aug-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
So visual bug is there

[14-Aug-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh but maybe it's feature because rewards credited back in same transaction üòÉ

[14-Aug-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a I sent 1 KMD but had 0.41 rewards so sending amount displaying as 0.58

[14-Aug-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
More bug than feature I think because confusing

[14-Aug-19 02:46 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
block explorer is same. tx without rewards, fee is 0.0001. When there are rewards, fee is a negative number

[14-Aug-19 02:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been confused by it before, now I just look for the negative fee. I wish banks had negative fees.

[14-Aug-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not about fee but about transaction amount

[14-Aug-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/d8fb5e8ab65b24f1e1c237778af0e6690faff617ccdd0a7799955349f8ae9c69 actually I sent 1 KMD

[14-Aug-19 02:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, that screen does look very strange üòÑ

[14-Aug-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
but on screenshot above it displaying like I sent 0.58 KMD (1 KMD - 0.41 rewards) what is quite confusing

[14-Aug-19 02:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so that is when reward is > funds being sent?

[14-Aug-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
no, I sent 1 KMD and rewards 0.41 KMD

[14-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
fee is (sum of inputs) - (sum of outputs)

[14-Aug-19 02:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, explorer makes more sense than screen

[14-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards are part of the sum of inputs

[14-Aug-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, in case of rewards just need to display amount of sending to destination vout as this number on top in AtomicDEX

[14-Aug-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
so it'll be clear like in explorer

[14-Aug-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
This thin edge between feature and bug üòÉ

[14-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jansako#3330
Could be addressed by the 'Fee' field being labelled as 'Fee - Rewards' or "Fee - negative if rewards claimed"

[14-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jansako#3330
The field would have to be KMD-specific, of course, unless other coins get rewards like that.

[14-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jansako#3330
may be simpler than messing with the math and still ending off because of the reward making the balance a different size than expected.

[14-Aug-19 03:38 PM] 27aume#8635

Ok so latest update on iOS doesn‚Äôt seem to swap. I am trying to buy kmd with btc and when I choose an existing order, it never matches. Never gets anywhere. Also when I pulled up control center and turned WiFi on, the whole app quit

[15-Aug-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
@fat3lvis are you on version 0.1.6 ? Can't reproduce control center crash on this one.
Also could you please send the app log via: "Settings -> Send feedback" and provide swap uuid? (to check on which side and why swap failed)

[15-Aug-19 03:16 PM] fat3lvis#6079
I‚Äôm on 1.6 flex and 12.3.1 iOS. I‚Äôll send log

[15-Aug-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
If it's not matched at all - is app creating order on "Orders" page instead of trade?

[15-Aug-19 03:16 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Dex not flex

[15-Aug-19 03:16 PM] fat3lvis#6079
There is an order sitting on orders page

[15-Aug-19 03:19 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Ok ‚Äúsend feedback‚Äù kicks me out of the app, as if I hit the home button

[15-Aug-19 03:19 PM] fat3lvis#6079
App is still open, but I get booted

[15-Aug-19 03:20 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Just restarted the app and it did it again

[15-Aug-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Can confirm issue with "Send feedback" on iOS 0.1.6

[15-Aug-19 03:23 PM] NMD3#0024
iOS v 0.1.6 (12) 
Swaps are not shown in order book, but if the app is open they are working.
Send feedback crashes the app

Rick & Morty chains getting updated, but no history

[15-Aug-19 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`Swaps are not shown in order book, but if the app is open they are working.` could you please elaborate - is orderbook not loading or you can't see ongoing swaps ?
`Rick & Morty chains getting updated, but no history` RICK and MORTY chains were restarted from scratch on some point, you can use faucet from pinned messages to get some

[15-Aug-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
@NMD3 Thats strange, RICK and MORTY chains were changed right between 29-30 July so now you can see some old chain transactions, from cache probably. 
Can you try to `Settings -> Logout` and login then? If it'll not help try to uninstall and install app back (ensure that you controll your seed)

[15-Aug-19 04:01 PM] NMD3#0024
Ok, Logout was already tried 
I will uninstall now...

[15-Aug-19 04:24 PM] NMD3#0024
@TonyL  Thanks a lot, uninstall and install again did the trick
Would be nice if there is a warning when uninstalling (seed and history)
Already did a swap and everything is fine

I can't seem to get a succesful build

[15-Aug-19 07:45 PM] Oszy#5734
that should be up to date where do you get stuck?

[15-Aug-19 07:49 PM] Oszy#5734
if `cargo build --features native -vv` does't run just do `cargo build` 
make sure you have `nightly-2019-08-05` set as default rust,  and don't forget to run `rustup component add rustfmt-preview`
it should build like this

Hello, I write because you told me that they would send me the invitation to try atomic swap to the new mail, and it was already weeks and they have not done it, the innocent problem was because they sent me the first invitation to my mail but the play store had another email

There is definitely something wrong with the latest version. I've reinstalled it. Restored one wallet. Seems to work fine.
Then I logged out and restored another wallet, then the app is rendering one frame every ten seconds for a while. Seems like it's good right now but there is something wrong at initialisation.

After closing the app and re-opening again. Same issue. The app freeze really badly at the connecting step it seems.

if you just want to try out atomic swaps, chainswap from #chainmakers  and #dex-hyperdex has a nice gui and they are working now.
both in beta, only experiment with small amounts.

[20-Aug-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi! Thats how swaps protocol works at the moment - if swap failing on stage when you already sent the taker fee it's not sending back
