My first few 10 swaps went through, 6 failed. Now everything seem to be stuck. I have like 30 orders waiting.

[31-Oct-19 12:44 PM] FtrSaroth#2069

looks like most fails at the moment are `startfailed` or `negotiatefailed`, which I dont count.

[31-Oct-19 12:45 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@cezo484 please explain in detail. And/or PM logs, from app Settings -> Share log -> Share

[31-Oct-19 12:45 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@modereck I can send some rick/morty if you have a new address.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Yep, so far mostly negotiations failed.

[31-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@Malti check above, you'll need first to uninstall app and reinstall it fresh from market.

[31-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
ok thanks a lot

[31-Oct-19 12:46 PM] 27aume#8635
Technicaly canceling trades to fast just cut your trues to connect to other node

[31-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I had same problem after update. Black screen. Remove app and reinstall.

[31-Oct-19 12:46 PM] debaas#3337
Yeah had the same thing. Removed app, then reinstall and works fine

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Malti if updating from a few versions ago, need to uninstall old version first

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] debaas#3337
Just no swaps seem to work

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] Malti#3948
Thanks a lot, doing it now

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] wookie#7663
So I cleared all my orders, accepted only 1 trade. Waited 15 minutes and nothing happened.

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] ubhillutd#3274
@wookie same

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] wookie#7663
If I just installed yesterday do i need to update?

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] RNI#2666
can't send log file

[31-Oct-19 12:47 PM] debaas#3337
Also when you have a bunch of swaps going on, you can't see the details of them. Can only cancel them but can't see status

[31-Oct-19 12:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
btw, if anyone is using same address on multiple devices, that is not going to work and will lead to fails. one address per device is recommended

Things might go better if all mobile traders cancel their maker orders

[31-Oct-19 12:48 PM] TonyL#3577
To clean up order books a little

[31-Oct-19 12:48 PM] farl#9964
@wookie no need to update

[31-Oct-19 12:49 PM] ubhillutd#3274
@TonyL I had about 15 orders put in. Canceled them all. Now only one in queue.

@Malti please ensure that you control the seed first before uninstalling

[31-Oct-19 12:49 PM] Malti#3948
yeah that's too late :p

[31-Oct-19 12:49 PM] danbedford#1068
@TonyL What does it mean if we send in an order as a Taker, but then the order is changed to Maker?

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] modereck#4269
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  thanks bro

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Malti#3948
but ok, lost some ricks and morty's üòÑ

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
another btw - leaderboard only counts the taker (alice). so best to buy from the book

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Booster99x#7054
So should we uninstall the app if we did it a few days ago ?

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] wookie#7663
Not sure what to do anymore. Canceled all my queuing orders, now even accepting 1 trade at a time did not go through after 15 minutes

[31-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
its not you wookie

[31-Oct-19 12:51 PM] danbedford#1068
What does it mean when you can‚Äôt cancel an order, and you can‚Äôt click on an order to see details?

[31-Oct-19 12:51 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
something is wrong and we are unable to make orders or its just really slow

[31-Oct-19 12:51 PM] modereck#4269
I cant see orders right now

[31-Oct-19 12:52 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
its working for somebody, i see one with 4 txos

here The AtomicDEX stress test is underway, and the MM2 network is experiencing a massive spike in traffic! This is exactly what the team wanted, and we‚Äôre collecting valuable data. If your swaps aren‚Äôt completing, please just keep trying!

[31-Oct-19 12:54 PM] vanity33#9778

[31-Oct-19 12:54 PM] debaas#3337
First swap just went through

[31-Oct-19 12:54 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
So far all my trades order didnt match. All 0/3, should i wait or cancel all of them and retry?

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] debaas#3337
Wait

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
Ok

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] ca333#0118
cancel all orders as soon as there is a cancel button

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] ca333#0118
@jkluwu0499

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] jkluwu0499#8218
Okay. Thanks

[31-Oct-19 12:55 PM] debaas#3337
Why cancel then ca333?

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] duskonaut#1244
I dont understand  why cancel

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Dirty Moe#2091
so his orders go through üòõ

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Hooftly#1337
how long do you wait before cancelling?  i have canceld a replaced a single order and its still not matching

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] farl#9964
I cancelled them,

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] ca333#0118
IF an order matches it matches - if not it will be automagically transformed into a maker-order and broadcasted across the network - this is why you re seeing hundreds of orders and also why you re not able to match @duskonaut

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Hooftly#1337
interesting

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] duskonaut#1244
Well few days ago Ihad no problem like that

[31-Oct-19 12:56 PM] ca333#0118
as soon as you see the cancel button @Hooftly - i.e. give it 5 - 10 seconds to match and then check its status in the orders tab

[31-Oct-19 12:57 PM] RNI#2666
had 31k rick .. closed the app .. now i have 7.77

[31-Oct-19 12:57 PM] RNI#2666
no swap worked

[31-Oct-19 12:57 PM] Booster99x#7054
So should we cancel all our pending orders?

[31-Oct-19 12:57 PM] ca333#0118
@duskonaut it is expected and we re increasing the network load as well in order to collect essential and VERY important metrics

not for me...not a single completed transaction

[31-Oct-19 12:58 PM] ca333#0118
we could have deactivated the maker-mode and let this look like a perfect swapping experience which would not have helped us to improve the network protocol and DEX technology - since we are targeting to cover millions of simult. users we really needed to do it this way - with minimal DEX infrastructure and highest load possible

[31-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Hooftly#1337
ok thats great it's going as expected for you guys but what about users who are unable to complete thirty swaps in the allotted time frame kind of unfair to put 4 hours in worth of effort to not be able to complete a single trade

[31-Oct-19 12:58 PM] ca333#0118
yes @Booster99x - cancel all pending orders if there is a cancel button

[31-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Malti#3948
