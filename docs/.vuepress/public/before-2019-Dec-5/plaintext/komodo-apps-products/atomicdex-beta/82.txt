keep the good work KMD team ‚ù§

[24-Oct-19 07:09 AM] Graal#2361
hope it will be as easy to list coin to atomicdex at it was in barterdex

[24-Oct-19 07:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Graal  there is a cost for integration into the mobile DEX , however one can integrate the coin into the backend and release their own GUI.  Other GUIs are in the works by other developers which may or may not have a listing charge .

I'm trying to test this out on an old galaxy s2, works OK, but its stuck on portfolio saying, connecting, forever. No network activity on that screen either. Anything I can do to find out why its stuck?

[24-Oct-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Checked logs, seem mm2 hasn't started, lots of connection refused errors.

[24-Oct-19 10:04 AM] Oszy#5734
wifi / 3g? newer samsung models had this problem a couple versions ago, we could kickstart it by starting the app a couple times, while tabbing out/back at the loading screen.

[24-Oct-19 10:22 AM] ca333#0118
@blackjok3r the Samsung S2 was launched with Android 2.3 and supported updates to 4.1.X if not mistaken - atomicDEX mobile supports Android starting with 5.x - please check your Android version and let me know

[24-Oct-19 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its 4.4.2.

[24-Oct-19 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ca333

[24-Oct-19 10:31 AM] ca333#0118
yea unfortunately not supported on that android SDK level @blackjok3r - could you somehow get 5.x installed? i just read on a few blogs that it seems possible if you re willing to root your device - few hackarounds exist for the current obstacles

Dex Mobil app crashes on me about once every 20 times I open it. Also I have to manually add back my assets pretty much every other time I open it. It usually shown my KMD balance but I have to add all smart chains to view.

After updating my atomicdex the app never loads and just displays a black screen indefinitely on launch

[25-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Lennart#9331

Hello
I just wanted to tell you that the work you are doing here, the AtomicDex goes beyond Komodoo.
It's a gift do the whole Cryptospace, to release Crypto from the chains of central exchanges.

[25-Oct-19 06:37 PM] cipi#4502
same here too... maybe someone is testing a bit before the real stress test begins
my prices are like this
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"setprice\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\",\"price\":2,\"volume\":1000}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"setprice\",\"base\":\"MORTY\",\"rel\":\"RICK\",\"price\":2,\"volume\":1000}"```
i think it is best to have the same price on all mm-nodes, that way the load will spread evenly across all mm-nodes

[25-Oct-19 06:38 PM] t0sma#0368
training for the D day lol. Making swap with the maximum efficiency lol

[25-Oct-19 06:39 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll switch back. A while ago I was asked to do 1:1 for people running out of coins.

[25-Oct-19 06:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be because so many orders hitting a hand full of bobs, waiting for utxos to return for the next trade cause a cascade in the queue. Might also do some utxo splitting to mitigate.

@Flint On what version you was when black screen occured last time? Have you try to restart the device?

[25-Oct-19 08:26 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL half an hour ago it was updated for the third time in a row - the two previous updates did not give the same result! It turns out that the fourth update from the current one back is the last working! When I start, I have a couple of seconds to see the DEX logo and immediately the black screen

[25-Oct-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@Flint Hmm, sounds like you updated from old version. Do you have your seed phrase saved in a safe place? If yes - please try to uninstall application and install again

Please re-check your seed phrase (words spelling, spaces and etc)

[25-Oct-19 09:08 PM] allbits#5898
Also check your address on an explorer, and compare to address shown in atomicdex. If they're not the same you put the seed in wrong.

[25-Oct-19 09:09 PM] allbits#5898
And the explorer will confirm to you that the funds are still safely in address

[25-Oct-19 09:10 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL I apologize - its my fault - I made a mistake in the word! all works now! thanks for the help!

Glad that it worked! Sorry for inconvenience caused by update

[25-Oct-19 09:14 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL  Nothing wrong! the main thing is that everything is safe - I still haven‚Äôt started large amounts until the wallet is finalized! It remains to wait for the liquidity in the wallet and you can enjoy forever!))

[25-Oct-19 09:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Good thing (which might be bad for sure if you lose it) is that you control the funds as long as you control the seed - no matter what happens with applicaiton or even with Komodo project

[25-Oct-19 09:19 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL Still such a question, will it be charged for stacking qtum in a mobile wallet?

[25-Oct-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Atm there is no possibility to stake QTUM in atomicDEX

[25-Oct-19 09:22 PM] TonyL#3577
If I remember correct QTUM full node requiring for staking and atomicDEX mobile wallet working in light (SPV) mode

[25-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Flint#6435
@TonyL  and to seek liquidity, how does binance do for their DEX when they keep it from 14 days for a fee? Or how will liquidity come at Komodo DEX? After all, you need to force users to keep funds there not only for instant exchange and withdrawal! perhaps the charge for retention motivates users and bring us liquidity, or are there other ways in the near future? And then our competitors are not sleeping - the same DEX bnb can make atomic permutations in addition to the rest and will select most of the users!

[25-Oct-19 09:29 PM] Flint#6435
binance however recently added such a QTUM reward option without a full client-side node as it used to be the only option for PoS

[25-Oct-19 09:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not fully aware but I think Binance staking QTUM centralized way (what rasing question about user funds possession matter and decentralization and etc)

[25-Oct-19 09:32 PM] TonyL#3577
For liquidty our team developing easy to use marketmaker software and elso there are negotiations with potential huge liquidity providers (but first step is easy to use software)

[25-Oct-19 09:34 PM] TonyL#3577
` After all, you need to force users to keep funds there not only for instant exchange and withdrawal!` it's a wallet with DEX functionality - you can use it for funds sending/receiving, KMD rewards claiming. And also you can trade funds decentralized way. Not sure why insta withdrawal somewhere is the case

[25-Oct-19 09:49 PM] Iago#8709
Is a standalone apk going to be available? Or maybe a release through fdroid or similar?

[25-Oct-19 09:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Standalone apk is not planned to be availiable anytime soon @Iago

[25-Oct-19 09:59 PM] Iago#8709
Wouldn't touch play store with a ten foot pole. Will wait patiently.

[25-Oct-19 10:01 PM] PTYX#6840
@Iago what's wrong with the playstore?

[25-Oct-19 10:01 PM] PTYX#6840
If your using an android, Google is already tracking you. Opening a burner email address to access the playstore makes no difference privacy wise.

[25-Oct-19 10:05 PM] Iago#8709
Just can't bring myself to press 'accept' on something I really don't. Don't mind me. Maybe only insofar as maybe creating a standalone apk option at some point.. :-)

[25-Oct-19 10:17 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
So how many people are actually beta testing the dex? Where do I find DEX stats to find out what kind of stress we are expecting in this test?

for the stress test.... does it have to be a minimum of 30 taker trades or 30 maker trades or a combination of?

7.77 rick is not enough for 30 trades

[26-Oct-19 07:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@jspook16 both ways RICK<->MORTY trades counting, and I think there will be no separation between maker/taker @ca333 please correct me if I'm wrong

@dudezmobi transaction fee is just 0.0001 so it's more than enough for 30 trades (when you sell RICK for MORTY you can sell back MORTY for RICK)

[26-Oct-19 03:46 PM] t0sma#0368
@dudezmobi with swap of 0.01 you make 777 atomic swaps with 7.77 RICK

[26-Oct-19 04:10 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Actually multiply that by 10000 if you trade back and forth

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #113 REL amount incorrect in orderbook after deleting decimals of already selected BASE coin when creating new order
How to Replicate:

Select any coin to trade (base) that has decimals in the amount you have, put max volume

Select the coin you want to receive (rel) , don't select from orderbook, but press create order, enter any amount

Now go back and delete the decimals of the base coin and press Trade

Order will be pushed to the orderbook with an insanely large or a much smaller number for the REL coin that you did set. 

Example: 
BASE: 59.9216431 
HUSH REL:  1 BTC 
go ahead and delete ....

[27-Oct-19 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734
`So when I have an open order and it gets filled if I don‚Äôt have the app open it fails?`  @MorganJekyll 
On android, the app can run in the background to complete the swap. Depends on your phone's power saving settings (wifi/4g keep alive while screen is off), background data usage settings etc etc ) 
On iOS you have to have the app open and the screen on at all times until the swap is finished. 

If the app is closed, or screen is locked, or network connection terminated, and the swap has already started (fee was sent), you can open the app again in a few minutes, to kickstart the swap before it fails (timeouts). If this does not happen, it will fail, and refund will be given in 4 hours.
