I think actually nothing happened... I pressed the back button from the "live trade" view and my balances are still okay. No pending order neither.

[16-Jul-19 02:47 AM] nymkappa#9440
Weird üòÑ

[16-Jul-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please describe by steps what you are trying to do / make screenshot?

[16-Jul-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@27aume yep, it's better to filter logs for package like a :
```adb logcat | grep -F "`adb shell ps | grep com.komodoplatform.redfox  | tr -s [:space:] ' ' | cut -d' ' -f2`"```

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] 27aume#8635
Cool

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] t0sma#0368
Can't update the app with Playstore. I tried to un install but I can't install it anymore. I'm one of the 1000 beta tester. And one of the previous beta. Need help  @ca333

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] TonyL#3577
No need to collect logs now @27aume but great that you learned new thing I think! üòÉ

`Redmi note 5 doesn't work`

Last hotfix update is broken, lets wait for @ca333

[16-Jul-19 02:52 AM] wl#4107
Ok

[16-Jul-19 02:52 AM] Mark81#4505
Can't even download here. Still in wait list.

[16-Jul-19 02:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Sorry for inconvience with update - happens on such early testing stages. And thanks everyone for participation! üôè

[16-Jul-19 02:54 AM] nymkappa#9440
Blockchain tech reached his peak today my friends. Much wow.

was able to download, but the app is titled redfox and won't run.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times with same result

[16-Jul-19 03:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@cryptoclueless it's temporary not possible to install the app

[16-Jul-19 03:43 AM] allbits#5898
Have completed multiple swaps with real coins. Revolutionary.  So much better than a centralized exchange - no waiting for deposits and withdraws, no risk of exchange shutdown. Easy and fun to use.

[16-Jul-19 03:46 AM] nymkappa#9440
Yes. Nice UX as well

[16-Jul-19 03:46 AM] nymkappa#9440
Some issues but the tech is here and its working

[16-Jul-19 03:46 AM] nymkappa#9440
Its quite fast too

[16-Jul-19 03:47 AM] nymkappa#9440
I think when the app will be stable...liquidity will explode and this will be a game changer

[16-Jul-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks for a feedback! Yes, it'll take some time to polish to stable release version but it's atomic swaps dex in your pocket, quite new thing as far as I know üòÉ

[16-Jul-19 04:01 AM] nymkappa#9440
I'm also interested in seeing if running a node could be used to make some small pocket satoshis ;)

My balances do not always update after withdraw and deposit operations. If I close the app and restart it the balances are all fine. I've had to do this three times.

[16-Jul-19 04:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it actual for some specific currencies? Have you tried to refresh transactions histroy page itself?

[16-Jul-19 04:14 AM] allbits#5898
It was VRSC only I think. I'll pay more careful attention in the future and report accurately. I believe I tried to refresh.

My KMD balance is not updated though

[16-Jul-19 04:31 AM] nymkappa#9440
It is only updated when the swap is completed..

[16-Jul-19 04:32 AM] nymkappa#9440
However I have this

[16-Jul-19 04:32 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@nymkappa Hi, this is how things are expected to work, app is sending real transactions on blockchains of selected coins so your balance is updated when these transactions are created and broadcasted. It also takes some time to negotiate the swap details between the nodes so you might notice some delay too.

[16-Jul-19 04:34 AM] nymkappa#9440
I think the wallet balances should reflect this

[16-Jul-19 04:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, but balance is locked "virtually" by ongoing swaps to prevent starting the swaps that are about to use more coins than you really have.

[16-Jul-19 04:35 AM] Mark81#4505
Finally installed but it's crashing from start due to update version 0.1.2?

[16-Jul-19 04:36 AM] TonyL#3577
it's temporary not possible to install the app, sorry for inconvenience

[16-Jul-19 04:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`I think the wallet balances should reflect this` - right, we need to discuss it, the balance meaning is actually "real coin balance on blockchain" so maybe it will be separate "locked balance" indication.

[16-Jul-19 04:40 AM] nymkappa#9440
Just to make sure. Any swap related to eth (ether or token) requires some initial balance right?

[16-Jul-19 04:40 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, you need ETH to buy ETH/ERC20 - it's required to run the smart contract functions unlocking the swap payment.

[16-Jul-19 04:48 AM] Tony Stark#4609

Also, it's called "redfox" and not AtomicDEX

[16-Jul-19 04:54 AM] Mark81#4505
It's due to update error on version  0.1 2 if I read correctly

[16-Jul-19 04:54 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, last hotfix 0.1 2 update is broken, please wait for a new version

[16-Jul-19 05:17 AM] Mylo#8306
plenty of co-ordintation happening, and the devs are busy atm.

the first goal is to make sure the first 100 users have no problems in the first few hours - there have been a cpl of beta hiccups which are being fixed.
the next beta testers will receive the follow up instructions (so they don't have to go through the same errors of the first 100).  hope you understand it's to allow ppl to process the success/problems without affecting everyone at the same time.

we may have aimed for one subset of beta testers first, maybe by timezone or phone model or some other "metric" or randomly.  i'm not aware of the choice, but it's so any minor errors don't affect everyone at once.

the channel has been made public, so everything is done transparently.

I have a failed swap but I lose token too. Is it normal

[16-Jul-19 05:37 AM] Mylo#8306
no you either have coins you had or coins you wanted.
depends what stage of the swap failed, there is a lock time on deposits.
someone with better tech/support understanding of the app/protocol will be able to respond more accurately

[16-Jul-19 05:38 AM] Mylo#8306
the lock time is protocol/blockchain enforced

[16-Jul-19 05:40 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@vichiet Please try to start the app in 3 hours from now, it should attempt to refund your payment, if it doesn't happen please let me know.

The only problem I notice so far with orbotVPN enabled AtomicDEX starting of app takes long activating all coins on startup

[16-Jul-19 06:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was mostly waiing on MORTY or RICK or ETH or USDC
BTC KMD VRSC loaded fine in my 4-5 restart app attempts

[16-Jul-19 06:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Maybe spv servers were either busy or not reachable or timed out on such slow connections over tor?

[16-Jul-19 06:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
