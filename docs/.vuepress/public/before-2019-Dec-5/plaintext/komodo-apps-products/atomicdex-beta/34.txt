Is siacoin capable of being atomically swapped with Atomicdex? I know it's not in the mobile ui of course, just wondering about the technical realities. Their lead developer is in their discord today talking about working on atomic swaps themselves in order not to be dependent on exchanges

[24-Jul-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure its not bitcoin protocol

In the short term it might be possible to do what binances fake dex does, where tokens that represent the non compatible coins are tradable.

[24-Jul-19 07:55 PM] wl#4107
Any help about this issue please?

[24-Jul-19 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
according to the error from your screenshot, you need to search that on google for answer. once of the answer i found is this https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/8505086?hl=en

[24-Jul-19 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
Try force closing Play Store and try to re-download again.

[24-Jul-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
this error is mostly related to play store server

[24-Jul-19 08:25 PM] Markus#5464
i think it would be better to change the popup scroll bar when selecting coin ur gonna swap to a text field with text matching cause imagine having 500 coins on the dex and scroll through to find 1 coin u wanna swap

[24-Jul-19 08:38 PM] Markus#5464
like a filter

[24-Jul-19 08:39 PM] allbits#5898
Following the link gives me the same thing. No update button. Just an "open" button

[24-Jul-19 08:39 PM] ca333#0118
next update with new coins will also add a search field (filter) and option to remove activated coins.

[24-Jul-19 08:39 PM] Markus#5464

you need to use the old address format till this is changed: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/5

[24-Jul-19 09:33 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I have clarification question, if I set up a trade that is stored in the order book, do I have to have my phone on, and AtomicDex open for someone to accept the trade, and for it to be processed?

[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] cipi#4502
yes, both nodes (maker and taker) need to be online to perform the swap

[24-Jul-19 09:36 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
so the hope is that more users = more liquidity, which eliminates the issue of the phone and app needing to remain on?

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] cipi#4502
yes... i also think that, as time passes, more people with atomicdex on PCs or servers will be there to offer liquidity

[24-Jul-19 09:37 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
So does an order then disappear from the orderbook when the app is closed? or does it remain, it just can't be successful?

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] cipi#4502
not sure about that, i haven't tried, but i guess the order will disappear from orderbook when you close the app... someone has to confirn this though

[24-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Crypto Rich#6241
@SHossain please see pm from me

[24-Jul-19 09:39 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I'm no programmer so I have no idea if its possible, but could there be a notification through the app if someone is interested in the swap?

[24-Jul-19 09:40 PM] SHossain#0007
@Crypto Rich ca333 will invite you soon. i've already forwarded your email to him

[24-Jul-19 09:41 PM] cipi#4502
@cryptoclueless i don't know either, but i guess it will be very difficult to implement this

[24-Jul-19 09:42 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
yeah, and maybe doesn't work with the whole trustless (dex) idea

[24-Jul-19 09:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I will put up a few more orders soon

[24-Jul-19 09:43 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
it would be nice if there was a way to allow the app to run in the background, maybe giving the user this permission option, as I'd expect it would eat at the battery

[24-Jul-19 09:56 PM] Mische#6695
Hey guys I have been testing barterDEX in the early days and am patiently waiting for my atomicDEX invite to snap some pictures - might it be possible to get the invite sooner ? I‘m on iOS 😃

[24-Jul-19 10:20 PM] ca333#0118
on android the app does process swaps and and other operations in the background. On iOS this is not possible though @cryptoclueless

{Reactions}
💯 

[24-Jul-19 10:21 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
ok, so the app can close as long as I don't log out, and swaps can still process?

[24-Jul-19 10:23 PM] ca333#0118
"close" is moving the app to the background and focus on some other app or locking screen for example - but if you "kill" the application then it wont do anything in the background.

[24-Jul-19 10:26 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
I believe I understand.  there is an option to "Log Out on Exit", so if I don't turn this switch on, and the phone locks after 2 minutes to save power, the app should still be running in the background.

[25-Jul-19 01:41 AM] allbits#5898
I updated to 0.1.4 and it's exhibiting poor behavior so far. Not loading orderbooks. Fiat balances are showing zero across the board (although the coin balances are all showing properly)

[25-Jul-19 02:20 AM] Regnar#6164
just a small design change I'd like to recommend on AtomicDEX, when you have an active trade ongoing, and you click on it from the "orders" menu, the whole "swap ongoing" screen should be moved up so that you don't have to scroll at all, currently the swap ID is cut off and there really isn't a need for this

[25-Jul-19 02:47 AM] allbits#5898
My orderbooks are fine now. But the fiat balance still shows at zero across the board.

[25-Jul-19 03:47 AM] TonyL#3577
@27aume please try to clean Play Store cache - helped me in similar cases (even phone reboot not helped but cache cleaning does)

@allbits please try to reboot phone, if it'll not help - please DM me your application logs (Settings -> Send report)

[25-Jul-19 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@Regnar thank you for feedback! Do you mean this ^^ screen?

[25-Jul-19 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it depends of phone screen size, maybe progress circle size should scale depends of the screen size to fit Swap ID 🤔 But in general Swap ID is debug/support information mostly in GUI

[25-Jul-19 04:35 AM] allbits#5898
Ok. Logs sent and screenshot of issue. Phone was rebooted

[25-Jul-19 04:42 AM] allbits#5898
Issue resolved by logging out and logging back in.  Settings > log out. Thanks Tony!

[25-Jul-19 04:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Was glad to help! 👍 Most probably it was caused by some cache + playmarket update

[25-Jul-19 04:47 AM] TonyL#3577
hope your experience will be smooth now 😃

[25-Jul-19 05:55 AM] Acura#2748
Don’t see the App anymore in TestFlight  App after the update on iOS. 
Normal? 🤔

[25-Jul-19 06:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, 0.1.3 is not visible in my Testflight too at the moment so it's normal state. It's related to propagation/approval of fresh 0.1.4 release with important fixes (to sync testing state with android platform)
