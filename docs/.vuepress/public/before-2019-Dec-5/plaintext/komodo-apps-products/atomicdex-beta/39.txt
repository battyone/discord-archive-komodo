@jl777c  Hello! How long will the beta be tested and will we see the final release this year - maybe in the leaf fall? !!!)

[29-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Angelina#6231
@ecbuddy can you try sending logs via different methods?

[29-Jul-19 06:54 PM] Angelina#6231
@Flint there are no set dates yet. But we will make sure to announce it!

[29-Jul-19 06:55 PM] Flint#6435
@Angelina Although would this year?))

[29-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Angelina#6231

best i could do

[29-Jul-19 07:22 PM] Angelina#6231
@ecbuddy in iOS AtomicDEX backend shutdown when app is not active (even if phone screen turn off because of inactivity), Can you try keeping the screen active while doing the swap?

[29-Jul-19 07:29 PM] TonyL#3577
At the moment backend trying to kickstart some of yours unfinished swaps, that‚Äôs why part of the coins locked. Please try to disable screen auto turn off and don‚Äôt switch to another applications for some time

[29-Jul-19 07:31 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@Angelina did a whole bunch of swaps with the app without the app being active

[29-Jul-19 07:32 PM] ecbuddy#8524
I am now keeping the screen active

[29-Jul-19 07:32 PM] ecbuddy#8524
although I have no swaps or pending swaps at the moment

[29-Jul-19 07:32 PM] ecbuddy#8524
and trying to initiate one gives errors in red (about balances) as I posted above

[29-Jul-19 07:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@ecbuddy as Angelina said, on iOS mm2 backend shutting down when operating system losing focus on app (screen turn-off or switch to another application). Right now on your side few swaps with "Timeout" status deadlocked backend because of the issue in swap kickstart logic. Developers already working on resolution and it will be resolved in next release.

[29-Jul-19 07:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Some swaps completed on your side after shutting down application because there is swap continuation feature, so seems it worked fine on your side in some cases 
But edge cases were found also - thats beta testing üòÉ

[29-Jul-19 07:54 PM] TonyL#3577
what you can do for now: 
a) if you don't have any swaps with your funds stucked in it - you can uninstall and install app. It'll delete information about your swaps but it'll not try to kickoff it anymore so funds will be unlocked
b) wait for the next release to update - problem you encountered will be resolved on the backend side

[29-Jul-19 08:02 PM] stealth#9257
My order never gets past this before timing out. Does that mean no match?

[29-Jul-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Please try to wait more time with screen turned on and without app closing or switching to another one

[29-Jul-19 08:09 PM] stealth#9257
Still no luck but will keep trying

[29-Jul-19 08:15 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@TonyL did as you suggested...deleted app, redownloaded

[29-Jul-19 08:16 PM] ecbuddy#8524
when I try to restore, inputting my details just creates a new wallet, and does not restore my old wallet and balances

[29-Jul-19 08:16 PM] ecbuddy#8524
am i doing somethign wrong?

[29-Jul-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
@ecbuddy please doublecheck your seed input, it should match the previous wallet seed

[29-Jul-19 08:22 PM] ecbuddy#8524
yes of course

[29-Jul-19 08:22 PM] ecbuddy#8524
it does match

[29-Jul-19 08:23 PM] ecbuddy#8524
have attempted 4x now\

[29-Jul-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Just to be sure: do you input 12 words seed or wallet password?

[29-Jul-19 08:28 PM] ecbuddy#8524
12 word seed

{Reactions}
üëç 

[29-Jul-19 08:31 PM] TonyL#3577
check grammar spelling, also there should be space between words

[29-Jul-19 08:36 PM] ecbuddy#8524
check

[29-Jul-19 08:36 PM] ecbuddy#8524
check

[29-Jul-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
is wallet address you see now for receive match previous one? are coins with balances activated?

[29-Jul-19 08:40 PM] ecbuddy#8524
balances activated

[29-Jul-19 08:40 PM] ecbuddy#8524
the wallet address does not match my wallet address

[29-Jul-19 08:42 PM] TonyL#3577
same seed phrase generating same wallet address, addresses missmatch means that there is a difference somewhere inbetween actual one and one you input

[29-Jul-19 08:43 PM] ecbuddy#8524
able to login agama with it lol

[29-Jul-19 08:43 PM] ecbuddy#8524
what is the proper way to restore wallet in atomicdex?

[29-Jul-19 08:43 PM] ecbuddy#8524
just click restore correct?

[29-Jul-19 08:44 PM] TonyL#3577
yes, proper way is to just click restore and input seed then

[29-Jul-19 08:46 PM] ecbuddy#8524
after 4x

[29-Jul-19 08:46 PM] ecbuddy#8524

what was the clue if not secret? üòÉ

[29-Jul-19 08:48 PM] ecbuddy#8524
despite being very careful, I must have been inputting the seed phrase wrong and creating a new wallet

[29-Jul-19 08:48 PM] ecbuddy#8524
cant think of what else it could be really

[29-Jul-19 08:48 PM] ecbuddy#8524
when  logged in through agama I knew it was all good though

[29-Jul-19 08:48 PM] ecbuddy#8524

[29-Jul-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
yep, some pedantry is needed with seed things. Especially on phone: small buttons + fat fingers = wrong wallet  üòÉ

[29-Jul-19 08:53 PM] ecbuddy#8524
Ps; I never shut down the app during the times I used it. I initiate, then continue doing other tihings while the app runs in background

[29-Jul-19 08:53 PM] ecbuddy#8524
is this ok?

[29-Jul-19 08:53 PM] ecbuddy#8524
been working the whole time for me

[29-Jul-19 08:53 PM] TonyL#3577
nope, mm2 (atomicdex backend) doesnt work in background on iOS - trust me üòÉ

[29-Jul-19 08:54 PM] ecbuddy#8524
ok

[29-Jul-19 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
most probably swaps were so fast so some finished before you close the app or during app re-opening kickoff

[29-Jul-19 08:56 PM] TonyL#3577
actually you can check it in app logs, on each startup backend printing version like a:
```29 18:50:55, mm2:144] AtomicDEX MarketMaker 64bfd683c
29 18:50:55, lp_native_dex:1311] version: 64bfd683c```

[29-Jul-19 08:57 PM] TonyL#3577
and there is a this event time print, so if it work in background time will be time in the past

[29-Jul-19 08:59 PM] ecbuddy#8524
Cool, I will inspect it

[29-Jul-19 08:59 PM] ecbuddy#8524
