[31-Jul-19 11:24 AM] cryptochas#4055
Update worked, used faucet after update, that worked. However trying to sell some Morty caused "loading orderbook" to hang.

Going to try logout/in then uninstall/reinstall if that doesn't work. Btw- on android.

Still hung up. Uninstalled and reinstalled. Clicked on restore and its asking me to name my wallet as if I clicked on create a wallet, a bit confusing.

[31-Jul-19 11:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@cryptochas even if you restore a wallet, you must give it a name so that from the next time you can login with a password

[31-Jul-19 11:44 AM] cryptochas#4055
Ok, but if I'm restoring a wallet, shouldn't it inherit the previous name/pass once restored? Or will it always require a new name/pass after a restore?

@gcharang if that is the case, I would make sure that the restore page appears differently from the new wallet page and communicates that clearly.

Currently "Create wallet" and "Restore", both options take the user to a screen that looks exactly the same. 

This might cause confusion to the user. Add some text to convey the difference between creating a new seed and restoring one.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #63 \[feature request\] \[x\] button deletes a whole number instead of 1 digit
I had 8.39088... RICK and I tried to swap 7.39088... RICK, so exactly 1 RICK is left on my account. 

First I clicked on "MAX", then I tried to delete the first digit '8' and type '7' in its place. Turns out clicking on [X] button on Android deletes the whole number. Pretty annoying.

[31-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Audo#5667
not sure what happened. Now I no longer got those orders up. Two swaps show on the history column
 - 2 RICK for 0.0167 KMD
 - 7 RICK for 0.0583 KMD

I tried to swap 12 RICK in total. @ca333 I think my phone should automatically remake an order if a swap did't fill up it entirely.

Not sure what happened to my MORTY order, it just dissapeared.

[31-Jul-19 02:24 PM] ca333#0118
if the remaining trade volume would be below 0.00777 its considered dust and the order gets removed - could this be the case?

[31-Jul-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0118
what was your order? 12 RICK for how much KMD ?

[31-Jul-19 02:27 PM] Audo#5667
hmm. I had 12 RICK for graps in total. Two swaps started (2 and 7 RICK = 9 in total). 3 RICK was left, which was in KMD a total of 0.025 KMD with the exchange rate I used.

(0,008333333 RICK/KMD, 12 RICK for 0.1 KMD)

[31-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Audo#5667
I also had an order for Morty (15 MORTY for 0.1 KMD). That order dissapeared without any record of a swap.

[31-Jul-19 02:31 PM] Audo#5667
