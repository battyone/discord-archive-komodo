This is the dev channel for the ecosystem dashboard project. The github repo for the core API is hosted at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/ - @Slyris is the dev and implementing this.

The (codename) "ecoboard" project is split into 2 subprojects:

A) the backend layer (above github repo) is a (golang) service that fetches ecosystem project related infos/data from various publicly accessible APIs - this includes blockexplorers [kmdexplorer.io, vrsc.kmdexplorer.io,...], coin market APIs [coinmarketcap, coingecko,...] and other 3rd party APIs. Furthermore this system persists a specific set of data locally (last price, blockchain statistic numbers, etc.) and serves a publicly accessible API so that other 3rd party projects can utilize it. The backend  can also request realtime data from external APIs like current blockchain stats by forwarding a request to external endpoints. 

B) the frontend layer is a mobile ready (responsive) website based on dashboard templates. This website interacts with the backend layer from A) - e.g. users can view data (get) or send specific requests (post) like blockexplorer queries.

@Slyris - these should be all coins we want to gather infos from: 
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.old

[08-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Slyris#2880
Thank you, I will finish setup golang server this evening, prepare the logger and finally began the router of the API in the backend.

external APIs we fetch the data from:

**blockexplorer data sources:** 
`*.kmdexplorer.io` where `*` is replaced with the ticker symbol of the chain. e.g. https://vrsc.kmdexplorer.io/ or https://pirate.kmdexplorer.io/ and 
`*.explorer.dexstats.info` resulting in https://k64.explorer.dexstats.info/ etc. - some chains aren't available on kmdexplorer.io but on the latter. 


**market stats (prices,...):**
https://www.coingecko.com/en/api
https://www.coinmarketcap.com

@ca333 "Furthermore this system persists a specific set of data locally (last price, blockchain statistic numbers, etc.)"

This means that we have to use a cache redis or a database ?

[08-Jul-19 06:01 PM] ca333#0118
yes - i think something like redis or mongo is enough for our purpose @Slyris

[08-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
ok, coinmarket api is not free, do you have an api key ?

[08-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
(since is not a personnal use)

[08-Jul-19 06:02 PM] ca333#0118
i see - in this case use only coingecko for now

[08-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Slyris#2880
ok

[08-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Slyris#2880
for the kmdexplorer and dexstats, do we have a documentation for those api ?

[08-Jul-19 06:14 PM] ca333#0118
they are both based on `insight` explorer and their API is pretty straight forward: https://gist.github.com/jackzampolin/da3201b89d23dd5fa3becb0185da1fb2 

both API endpoits serve under `insight-api-komodo` in our case. 
e.g. `http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/insight-api-komodo/addr/RSp8vhyL6hN3yqn5V1qje62pBgBE9fv3Eh`

[08-Jul-19 06:18 PM] ca333#0118
we will fetch a specific set of general blockchain infos of all chains into the persistence layer: current blockchain height, blockhash, and so on. 
And more specific infos like the example api url from above are the user-specific requests (not for the persistence layer). So our ecosysboard backend will just forward this requests to the explorer APIs.

[08-Jul-19 06:18 PM] Slyris#2880

@ca333 I added you on the pull request, a basic http router and a ping request on the coingecko api for you to get an idea of ​​the architecture of the program.

The coverage decrease, but this is not a problem, some part are just not testable since we use external apis

Hi, the `coingecko` API is clearly according to the documentation no complete at all and only works with ethereum for most of the requests, so I started with the insight  apis of komodo, i will push my first request of `kmd dexstats explorer`

For now I have no cache management, we will see how we want to manage our cache, on which elements in particular.

How much do the paid API's cost? Like coinmarketcap API. If it's not anything too crazy we could consider paying for it.

coincodex API... sure if you think it's good!

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Slyris#2880
I think coincodex api is poor, but free. and for coinmarket cap we can be limited

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Audo#5667
should be, yes. What does that cost? But if we achieve the same with coincodex then we can opt-in to use that

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Slyris#2880
So maybe we should just try, and look if it's fit

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Audo#5667
ok

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Slyris#2880
Maybe the marketing can drop a mail to coinmarketcap and ask them if we are eligibile for free usage

[09-Jul-19 04:25 PM] Slyris#2880

[09-Jul-19 07:21 PM] Audo#5667
Hey guys,

The rebranded website also has few stat boxes. IBN is asking if we will have these data points ready for the launch (this week). If not, then they will be scoped out from the rebrand release.

- Last Github Commit (would have to check the details, I think it's supposed to say something like "Last commit by ca333 made 39 minutes ago"
- Total Github Commits (we would have to add commits from multiple repos together)
- Most Commits Placed (who has made the last commits in some given period of time, like 30 days)
- Atomic Swaps in last 24 hours
- 24 Hour swap volume
- Number of Liquid KMD pairs (KMD pairs above some arbitrary treshold trading volume value)

> these data points are supposed to be on the site. the best way to do this is to provide us with an API endpoint that gives us all of this data at once in one call. could you work with someone on this on your end before end of week? otherwise we will need to descope it for the launch

Just let me know if we can finish any of these, if not, no problem. IBN just needs to know if they should plan it in the first version or into a post rebrand version.

[09-Jul-19 08:34 PM] ca333#0118
Hi @Audo - the github stats can be fetched from the github API. We have not included this into the current backend, but can add this in the future.

The atomic swap count is not tracked right now and i am not sure if its technically possible to track the global swap count. We will figure this out.

[09-Jul-19 08:36 PM] ca333#0118
We can check the orderbook of the main netid in order to show liquid pairs - however, there could be much more ("invisible") orders up.

[10-Jul-19 12:14 AM] ca333#0118
great - yes, test flow/order can be as important as the actual test.

[10-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Audo#5667
Once you guys take a closer look at the templates we could see if we can also showcase our roadmap on the dashboard.

I was looking at several dashboard templates yesterday and thinking about it. We could simply use 'cards' that have some heading, graphic, and a sentence description about the technology (such as  AtomicAPI), and then it has a link to a more detailed post about this specific thing.

`typo, it's status alright ?` - yes - typo
`for the moment i will get the currency exchange price from the dexstat api, or you want me to get it from directly from binance,hitbtc,bittrex etc ?` - it would be very handy if we could fetch the prices from wherever they are available - dexstats, coingecko,... - but if the current solution is fully functional we can stick to one API (dexstats) for now and add others later. Would be also good to figure out if dexstats itself uses coingecko or other 3rd party APIs ( @Mylo can you check with CHMEX please?)
`Are post requests necessary for ecosysboard ?` - yes, we actually wanted to add a search field to ecosysboard frontend like in https://www.kmdexplorer.io/ - users could post address, blockhash, txhash or height as input and `ecosysboard` checks if a matching record was found in insight and redirects the user to the corresponding url.

[11-Jul-19 05:46 PM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 Hello !

[11-Jul-19 05:49 PM] Slyris#2880
When you do a search on https://kmdexplorer.io is behind you make a request block, if it is not a block I test if it is a transaction, if it is not a transaction I test if it's an address? Or do you have some kind of parser that automatically detects it's an address, a block or a transaction, if so I guess this parsing is accessible somewhere?

[11-Jul-19 10:18 PM] ca333#0118
`you make a request block, if it is not a block I test if it is a transaction, if it is not a transaction I test if it's an address?` - lets only forward the request to the AP IF the user-input is pre-validated and filtered as best as we can to prevent explorer API spam:
If its a decimal number <= current blockheight its a block.
If its a 27 - 34 chars long base58 encoded string (prefix byte `60`dec / `3C`hex resulting in all KMD addresses starting with `R`) we know its an address (komodod has a `validateaddress`
 call but you can also use any base58 lib to validate the userinput). And if its a 32 byte long HEX its likely a TX ID or blockhash - check for TX hash first since endusers are more likely going to look for TXs.

[12-Jul-19 08:22 AM] Slyris#2880
As the komodo is not the only currency to manage, the other addresses do not parse in the same way? I planned to make a register that associates a regex to a currency, so we would have the same function regardless of the currency

[12-Jul-19 08:24 AM] Slyris#2880
