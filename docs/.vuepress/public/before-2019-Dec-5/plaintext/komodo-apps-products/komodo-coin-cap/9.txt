it is basically a coinmarketcap clone with additional blockchain related informations and metrics - we do use the native blockchain interface to fetch infos/data from. However, the coin-cap application itself is not executed "on" the blockchain.

Alright, excited to see the results üëç

[16-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Slyris#2880
(on my machine)

[16-Aug-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
So issue should be in my machine configuration it seems

[17-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL The programm turn the whole night for me without any problem

[17-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Slyris#2880

[17-Aug-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
yep, on my laptop working fine for a long time as well, so issue is somewhere in my server configuration

@Slyris how are you

[01-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm super fine thank's

[01-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Slyris#2880
and you ?

[02-Sep-19 05:49 AM] Slyris#2880
@CryptoMedication   yeah ?

[04-Sep-19 04:56 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is there anyone actively working on the front-end part ? This is my wip using VueJS + Tonyl's endpoint <http://35.159.51.208/coinCap> (I'm still learning things so my progress will be slow üòÖ )

[04-Sep-19 05:02 PM] PHBA2061#2530
and about this api call <http://35.159.51.208/coinCap>, most coins use tickers, like /api/v1/kmd or /api/v1/dex  except for Pirate ,  /api/v1/pirate works but /api/v1/arrr doesn't

[04-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Slyris#2880
cc @turinglabs

[04-Sep-19 05:09 PM] Slyris#2880
/api/v1/arrr doesn't work because the good endpoint is pirate

I think it is the ac_name that is used and not the ticker (except for exceotion of kmd)

ah yeah that's work now

[07-Sep-19 06:14 PM] Slyris#2880
@dukeleto Do you want the instructions for adding Hush into Komodo coincap ?

[07-Sep-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
may as well just pin them here

[07-Sep-19 06:16 PM] Slyris#2880 (pinned)
```
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/blob/master/esb_config.json#L7

In this file, just add an new entry with all your information.

if youre coin is not present in coinpaprika or coingecko you can let it empty for coingecko_id and give the same name as the field coin for coinpaprika_id
```

[07-Sep-19 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

[08-Sep-19 07:32 PM] Regnar#6164
Just scrolled through the `esb_config` file, looks like Coinpaprika is on their game

[08-Sep-19 08:03 PM] Slyris#2880
@Regnar What do you mean ?

[08-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Regnar#6164
a good thing, Coinpaprika has always been good for me when I try to add coins and info, so it's no surprise the `coin_paprika_id` field on that entire document is filled

[08-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i designed this configuration file !

[08-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Slyris#2880
So it's easier you parse when developing the application coincap

[08-Sep-19 08:05 PM] Regnar#6164
yea good idea

[08-Sep-19 08:06 PM] Regnar#6164
Is there anything specific we need someone to work on right now? I know some python

[08-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Slyris#2880
On this specific project you mean @Regnar  ?

[08-Sep-19 08:08 PM] Regnar#6164
yea

[08-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Slyris#2880
The project is written in golang (back-end)

I will let you know once the test period will be over, what is our future plans

[08-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Slyris#2880
For the moment we still discusss about it !

[08-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Regnar#6164
okay sounds good, I can test APIs then üòõ

[08-Sep-19 08:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, there is a docs folder inside the repository, feel free

[08-Sep-19 08:11 PM] Regnar#6164
cool thanks

[12-Sep-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris i am on it

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Slyris#2880
Great @dukeleto pinned message is for you

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
what are the "rules" for `git` ?

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I see the file I need to add to

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can add organizations or particular repos?

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Slyris#2880
Full URL for specific repos or organisation name

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Slyris#2880
And that's all

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see it now

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
`kmd` has a good example of all the optinos

groovy

[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is very nice

[12-Sep-19 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
Now I remember talking about it to y'all, when it only supported listing every repo

[12-Sep-19 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
supporting orgs is very nice!

hi, I notice that the API request /api/v1/tickers/kmd  returns additional_data.links.repos_url.github[0] which is <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform>, it doesn't exist though, should be just <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform>

[25-Sep-19 09:23 PM] Slyris#2880
It's coingecko

it's not a very big issue for me though, I can just pick another github url

[25-Sep-19 09:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
also some coins `max_supply` shows 0, like kmd, dex or rfox

[25-Sep-19 09:55 PM] Slyris#2880

@PHBA2061 any reason Hush isn't listed? I think I added a PR a long time ago to support it

[13-Oct-19 04:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
may be @Slyris can answer the question ? Hush isn't added to the back-end yet

[13-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Slyris#2880
