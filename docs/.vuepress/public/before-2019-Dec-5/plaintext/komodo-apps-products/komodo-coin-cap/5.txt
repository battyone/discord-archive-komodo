it would also be interesting to see actually

[25-Jul-19 01:30 PM] ca333#0118
which projects have their own repos and codes, wallets, tools, etc. and which projects dont...

[25-Jul-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris it would be smart of your code to know the difference between a pure smart chain and a source fork

[25-Jul-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC and HUSH are source forks, maybe you could consider PIRATE one, but mostly they use the main KMD repo. Pirate does have it's own github org, tho

yes - lets add `source_fork: bool isSourceFork`

[25-Jul-19 01:35 PM] ca333#0118
so VRSC and HUSH are `true` - rest should be false.

i use KMD codebase for my PIRATE nodes - so should be safe to set ARRR to `false`

[25-Jul-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 is SAFE considered an Antara Smart Chain? :troll_compadre:

such as: https://api.github.com/orgs/KomodoPlatform/repos ?

[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] Slyris#2880
@ca333

[25-Jul-19 02:00 PM] ca333#0118
yes exactly @Slyris

[25-Jul-19 02:00 PM] Slyris#2880
Great i got it üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 02:01 PM] Slyris#2880
But what if fork collapse with Org @ca333  ?

[25-Jul-19 02:01 PM] Slyris#2880
Such has @jl777c  we prefer use his repo of komodo instead of the one from the org

[25-Jul-19 02:02 PM] ca333#0118
lets list both in this special case - jl777 repos are considered the dev-repos while on KP we host the official/production repos.

[25-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Slyris#2880
ok

[25-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Slyris#2880
so i will clone into Org/UserName repos then.

[25-Jul-19 02:45 PM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 GitHub Apps making server-to-server requests use the installation's minimum rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. Organization installations with more than 20 users receive another 50 requests per hour for each user. Installations that have more than 20 repositories receive another 50 requests per hour for each repository. The maximum rate limit for an installation is 12,500 requests per hour.


i Will fetch data only one time per hour ok ?

[25-Jul-19 02:46 PM] Slyris#2880
Becuase it's does lot of request

[25-Jul-19 02:47 PM] ca333#0118
once an hour is fine for now - but lets target `"real-time"` for the future

[25-Jul-19 02:48 PM] Slyris#2880
How can we target real time if github is limiting our request rates

[25-Jul-19 02:48 PM] Slyris#2880
i mean we will reach it so fast

[25-Jul-19 02:49 PM] ca333#0118
Integrating the github-stats fetcher into ecosys-board instead of using github API. 
e.g. you can fetch any website low-level (curl, etc.) and parse it however you want - this means we could be fetching any github org page and parsing it in html to get all repositories recursively, etc.

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] Slyris#2880
Ah yeah we will do that later

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] ca333#0118
so as you can see: realtime is possible, not even hard to implement - even if we had to write our own github page parser

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok it's not urgent for the moment i think

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] ca333#0118
but for now we can use all these 3rd party APIs for everything

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] ca333#0118
exactly - for now we just want to get the base system up and running.

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] ca333#0118
and from there we can keep optimizing such things

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] Slyris#2880
oki :^

hello

[26-Jul-19 05:58 AM] Slyris#2880
are you here @ca333 I got few questions for the next steps

[26-Jul-19 06:58 AM] ca333#0118
next steps: we stop feature-additions and start with the frontend-layer. Do we have interested parties for the bounty task? i.e. have you already been contacted by potential webdevs?

looking at django + core-ui

[26-Jul-19 07:11 AM] ca333#0118
@Slyris todays workpackage:

a) get a responsive reactJS skeleton set up for the landing page view (smartchain table/list)
b) integrate https://coreui.io/demo/#main.html and make sure the frontend is responsive

Details we do want in a) are coinname, marketcap, coin supply (circulating), 24h volume, 24 price change, price per coin, dPoW status (green or red), current height, and last but not least the dPoW gap (time since last notarization)

[26-Jul-19 07:46 AM] turinglabs#2390
So we need to implement that template?

[26-Jul-19 07:47 AM] turinglabs#2390
There's a final web design made in Photoshop or something like that? Just to understand better how will should look like at the end

[26-Jul-19 07:54 AM] ca333#0118
@turinglabs you re planning to do it with react?

[26-Jul-19 07:54 AM] turinglabs#2390
It will be faster with vuejs, but if you prefer react I can do with it

[26-Jul-19 07:56 AM] turinglabs#2390
At the end the result will be the same I think

[26-Jul-19 07:57 AM] ca333#0118
vueJS is fine too @turinglabs

[26-Jul-19 07:57 AM] ca333#0118

@turinglabs There will be an addition in the configuration to add the path to the frontend folder (to serve the index.html)

[26-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Nevertheless, there are solutions to overcome such as packer or appimage if we want a single binary

@Slyris frontend and backend will be in the same server?

@turinglabs I think it's better

[26-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs And how can i serve the files if we are not in the same server

with vue

[26-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
you build to a folder like "web/dist" and i serve this folder

[26-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
For development mode you launch both app and the front end call the back-end layer

[26-Jul-19 09:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Everything is explained in the readme from this repository it's really simple !

[26-Jul-19 10:02 AM] ca333#0118
@Slyris it should be fully up to @turinglabs how to implement it. i.e. since the ecosys-board is a normal API he can just grab the data from there without having to use the go-vue-template

[26-Jul-19 10:02 AM] ca333#0118
i.e. the frontend is completely independent of the backend.

[26-Jul-19 10:02 AM] Slyris#2880
he dont have to use the template, it's just an example ^^'

[26-Jul-19 10:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Usually once the frontend is builded, i serve the folder and everything work, but if there is another solution i trust him

[26-Jul-19 10:03 AM] ca333#0118
`you build to a folder like "web/dist" and i serve this folder` - this sounded irritating. The backend is an API so he can grab the data from the endpoints on a specific host:port but not on a folder.

[26-Jul-19 10:05 AM] turinglabs#2390
@Slyris you are right

[26-Jul-19 10:05 AM] turinglabs#2390
vuejs create a build which have to be served statically

[26-Jul-19 10:06 AM] Slyris#2880
as you wish ^^'

[26-Jul-19 10:07 AM] Slyris#2880
i let the decision between you and @ca333

[26-Jul-19 10:07 AM] Slyris#2880
I will adapt my self to the solution

[26-Jul-19 10:07 AM] ca333#0118
you re misunderstanding this @turinglabs - the frontend has to be fully independent of the backend. The backend will NOT serve static data on a specific folder.
