So i am waiting for them to port that functionality from mm 1.0 to mm 2.0 then my devs can start porting hyperdex over. I dont think there should be too big of a delay between mm 2.0 being 100% ready and when hyperDEX can use it

[26-Jun-19 07:22 AM] CoinKing88#1540
@hyperDEX Okay thanks, atomicdex uses the barterdex asset also in the backend(DEX)?

[26-Jun-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes so atomicDEX is the mobile GUI the KMD team created

[26-Jun-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So it will be part of the DEX asset

[26-Jun-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The back end uses the new mm2.0 which is the upgrade of mm1.0 which was used by barterDEX and hyperDEX

[26-Jun-19 08:50 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Thanks for the update, i'll keep hodling my DEX assets (would be nice if there will be a liquid market soon), my delta app fluctates very heavily b/c of the DEX (although the price of DEX is the same for the last days on CoinExchange due to lack of volume).  20-25% changes out of nowhere give me a heartattack sometimes üòÉ

[26-Jun-19 11:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
haha

[06-Jul-19 02:23 AM] Regnar#6164
Hey @hyperDEX so what's the word on porting over to MM2? Do you guys have a rough timeline for when you can start/finished?

[06-Jul-19 06:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Regnar Unfortunately there were some miscommunications surrounding how our GUI was built and what functionalities mm2.0 requires for it to be a easy port. Unfortunately it is more work but i have asked Sindre to look into. No ETA at the moment as  there seems to be a few things we have to change with the current interface.

We will try to get it out ASAP

hey all do we have to be signed into google play store as the email we registered to download hyperdex?

[20-Jul-19 02:24 PM] furshure123#1929
Mine says coming soon - register

[20-Jul-19 02:24 PM] furshure123#1929
under play store

[20-Jul-19 06:27 PM] Regnar#6164
@furshure123 you're confusing HyperDEX with AtomicDEX. This is HyperDEX the desktop DEX platform.

[20-Jul-19 06:28 PM] Regnar#6164
try #atomicdex-beta for your question

[24-Jul-19 10:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Hi All, we are porting hyperDEX to mm 2.0. We have very early builds out https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex-nightlies/releases/tag/v0.0.0-c2d7531-19.7.24.1745

If you are adventurous give it a go and report any issues you may find. This is early so may not be good for grandmas just yet.

[25-Jul-19 03:22 AM] allbits#5898
Working well so far.  I did freeze my whole system when I tried to remove a coin

[25-Jul-19 03:54 AM] allbits#5898
I seemed to get an error. Forget what it said but it have the option to print the error? So I did. I now have kmd/Bch swap stuck at step three. And no more orderbooks showing up for any pairs

[25-Jul-19 04:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
When it crashes it clears all the other order @allbits and only keeps the ones in progress

[25-Jul-19 04:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But that is something we will work on, recover from crashes "gracefully"

[25-Jul-19 05:26 AM] SvetJordanov#9163
@hyperDEX reported the issue üòÉ Will test some more after work

[25-Jul-19 05:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Thanks. Please check the issues located at https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/issues just in case it has been reported already. Sindre will be offline for about 24 hours

[25-Jul-19 04:33 PM] vichiet#4058
Just buy 1 Dex coin from hyperdex . Very nice and fast

[25-Jul-19 04:46 PM] hastrup#8742
@vichiet what was the price?

[25-Jul-19 04:50 PM] jansako#3330
40 KMD per. I have a pair of orders up for testing.

[25-Jul-19 04:57 PM] vichiet#4058
40 kmd

[25-Jul-19 04:57 PM] Acura#2748
If anyone needs DEX, i can sell it for 40kmd

[25-Jul-19 04:58 PM] vichiet#4058
Create a marketmaker , I think you will sell very fast

[25-Jul-19 04:59 PM] vichiet#4058
I create an order at 35 kmd if you want to try with me on hyperdex

[25-Jul-19 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
Race to the bottom!!!! :troll_thuglife:

[25-Jul-19 05:05 PM] hastrup#8742
@Acura what was the highest price you can recall for dex?

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jansako#3330
I think about 47 or so at the height of the pump when MM1 was released

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jansako#3330
Supernet was at that time ~42-45

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember it traded at 100

[25-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jansako#3330
woot?

[25-Jul-19 05:16 PM] jansako#3330
OK, I did sell some DEX for 0.02 BTC, but neither KMD nor BTC were at today's prices... (October 2018)

[25-Jul-19 05:17 PM] hastrup#8742
@jansako ofc. but think it's selling for 40 right now whit a product. And 100 whit no product.  Just a matter of time

[25-Jul-19 05:18 PM] hastrup#8742
Beforüéâüéâ

[25-Jul-19 05:18 PM] jansako#3330
It is selling at 40 because that is how high I set my order... if (when) it sells I will put the next one higher üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 05:19 PM] jansako#3330
unless someone else undercuts me, of course!

[25-Jul-19 05:20 PM] hastrup#8742
Understandable  but 40 each is a good price :)

[25-Jul-19 05:20 PM] jansako#3330
Agreed.

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] Acura#2748
@hastrup for me i had seen 2017 highest price 58kmd one Dex - Could have been higher, of course.

[25-Jul-19 05:23 PM] hastrup#8742
@Acura thx for info!

[25-Jul-19 06:02 PM] willofleo#7505
Dex is one of those coins that will either go big or go home and if it goes big that a hell of a gain  like binance hell of a gain

[25-Jul-19 06:02 PM] allbits#5898
I get error "unhandled promise rejection" again. Seems to happen right after I start a second simultaneous swap

[25-Jul-19 06:07 PM] allbits#5898
Swaps completed tho. But I had to restart to see the updated balances.

[25-Jul-19 06:07 PM] jansako#3330
that you feeding me DEX?

[25-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jansako#3330
on my node it was sitting on some sort of http_fallback:464 status, but eventually got over it & completed

[25-Jul-19 06:11 PM] jansako#3330
says things like "time to use http fallback"

[25-Jul-19 06:12 PM] allbits#5898
This time I got unhandled promise rejection with just one swap outstanding.

[25-Jul-19 06:12 PM] hastrup#8742
@willofleo I do not agree whit that. If atomicdex api is a top 50 exchange. That in my mind is a success. But its now boom or bust but decent.

[25-Jul-19 06:27 PM] allbits#5898
Then I just waited without swapping and got the unhandled promise rejection error. Once that happens, balances and orderbooks stop updating and restart is required

[25-Jul-19 08:18 PM] willofleo#7505
@hyperDEX I see that sometimes  orders are no longer visible after a while when doing other things but that is fix when hyperdex is closed and restarted , a "Refresh button will be convenient or a circle icon with arrows point clock wise , so one can just click on it and orders reappear

[25-Jul-19 08:56 PM] willofleo#7505
@hastrup  we do agree with top 50 , binance is in top 50 too üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 09:27 PM] hastrup#8742
@willofleo XD üòÇ

[25-Jul-19 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@allbits devs will look at that soon. Sorry just ramping up and i have another dev starting soon so fixes should hopefully be faster.

[25-Jul-19 09:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@willofleo it should be always up to date. If you can somehow recreate that can you raise a issue on github? https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/issues

All good. Just reporting what I find :)  Great to back on hyperdex again! Brings back memories. And it's already working so much better!

[25-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think the bugs being reported should be easy enough to solve.

[25-Jul-19 10:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The new dev will be working on the arb bot side of things üòÉ

[25-Jul-19 10:32 PM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX great to hear you have a new Dev!! üëç

[25-Jul-19 11:28 PM] allbits#5898
When the user clicks on an order, the price field is automatically populated - at the moment, it is populated with a price that is a little lower than the price clicked on. This was necessary in the olden times.  But now, the actual price clicked should be populated.

[25-Jul-19 11:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@allbits we are waiting for the mm2.0 team to change the API for that but we are working to resolve that in the GUI once done

[25-Jul-19 11:36 PM] bigpromo16#8101
I got invited to the atomicdex but my email wasnt attached to my google play account. The email said contact someone here on discord.

[25-Jul-19 11:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@bigpromo16  hit up #atomicdex-beta

[25-Jul-19 11:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This channel is for the desktop app

[25-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@hyperDEX   Can't customize the price of the pending order?

[26-Jul-19 12:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you can set limit orders

[26-Jul-19 12:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We are working on a way to cancel the order. For now if you close the app and reopen the orders should be cancelled

[26-Jul-19 12:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is not ready to be used for real trading. Little amounts is fine but please be aware we are still trying to get a stable release out, this is a very early beta

[26-Jul-19 06:43 AM] miles#6381
just got set up and managed a few swaps - awesome job guys, so much smoother now! thank you!

[26-Jul-19 07:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@miles should be a lot better when we fix up the small little issues we have with mm2.0

{Reactions}
rum 

[26-Jul-19 07:46 AM] miles#6381
No doubt! But for such and early beta to out so quick and useable for small stuff is credit to everyone! Out of interest, I can see a difference between the fees for AtomicDEX and HyperDex for coins that are common (ltc for example) at the moment, is this something that will be aligned in the future so that users have. It need to think where to swap for the best rate?

[26-Jul-19 08:21 AM] Acura#2748
How there is a cancel Button for an open order on hyperDex?

[26-Jul-19 08:35 AM] Acura#2748
Is there also an option to Withdraw Coins from hyperDex?

[26-Jul-19 08:36 AM] Acura#2748
Otherwhise the user must Login via an another wallet to withdraw

[26-Jul-19 08:47 AM] jansako#3330
The button is on the 'wallet' tab, under each coin you have 'deposit' and 'withdraw'.

[26-Jul-19 08:48 AM] jansako#3330

my first trade went trough without any Problems - i love it

[26-Jul-19 09:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@miles  you mean fees or the rate? The mm2.0 team need to create a new API that gives accurate numbers, then we dont need the small % margin of error. Say i was to buy something listed for 0.1, when you click on it, our DEX might sell it for 0.09 instead. This was due to the mm1.0 needing this error margin. It will still execute at 0.1 though

Hi, can you explain how hyperDEX works and how it differs from other swap/exchange apps in the Komodo ecosystem? Thanks

[26-Jul-19 01:28 PM] gcharang#6833
@D2D privacyalternatives.com all the DEXes in the komodo ecosystem use the same backend - mmV2
they are all different GUIs so they have different UX + UI + features

creating an order in one of them will match in all the others
