Tried re-logging into HyperDEX, that did not help

[17-Sep-19 06:24 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
10 confirmations now, still not showing.  Guess that's what I get for being excited and sending a tenth of a BTC.  Thank you for any help you can provide this newbie.

[17-Sep-19 08:04 AM] phideas#8309
@FTL_Ian you are on old version of hyperdex. you can try out current nightly builds instead. remember hyperdex is in early development stage. only test with small amounts and report bugs. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex-nightlies/releases/latest

Using the latest nightly - got an error of:  "cannot read property of base_amount in undefined", when trying to place an order

[17-Sep-19 06:34 PM] jorian#4555
probably incompatible with latest mm2?

[17-Sep-19 06:35 PM] jorian#4555
@hyperDEX how much dev is going into HyperDEX?

[17-Sep-19 06:35 PM] jorian#4555
is it being prepared for mm2?

[17-Sep-19 06:35 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
hmm, I can't appear to put a photo here

[17-Sep-19 06:35 PM] FTL_Ian#8600

hmm... maybe I need ETH in an account since I'm requesting USDT?

[17-Sep-19 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[17-Sep-19 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
gas fees

[17-Sep-19 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
but not sure if you need it when you buy ERC20

[17-Sep-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
anything dealing with ETH or ERC20, needs ETH

[17-Sep-19 07:06 PM] jorian#4555
no matter whether you're maker or taker?

[17-Sep-19 07:07 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
May want to make the error more clear to the user.  In my case, using Ubuntu 19.04, it pops up and goes away.  If I weren't  watching, I'd never know it.

[17-Sep-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think both maker and taker need to invoke the atomic swap contract on ETH, which costs gas

[17-Sep-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
general rule is ETH charges gas for everything

[17-Sep-19 08:26 PM] cipi#4502
both taker and maker need gas when dealing with erc20... and USDT is not supported by mm2

[17-Sep-19 08:31 PM] cipi#4502

simply use USDC instead

I do not see USDC in HyperDEX's list of options

[17-Sep-19 09:23 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
It has USDT, GUSD, and TUSD

[17-Sep-19 09:23 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
What is MM2?

[17-Sep-19 09:23 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
I'm using the Nightly from 9/16.

mm2 is https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API

[17-Sep-19 10:54 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
AtomicDEX is also known as MM2?

[17-Sep-19 10:54 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
I was wondering if AtomicDEX would be able to interact with trades from HyperDEX and vice-versa.

[17-Sep-19 10:54 PM] PTYX#6840
MM2 lives inside the atomicdex

[17-Sep-19 10:55 PM] PTYX#6840
hyperdex also use mm2 as far as i understand it. this goes for any implementation that wants to get liquidity/orders from the general network.

[17-Sep-19 11:32 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
So how come USDT is in HyperDEX if it's not included in MM2?

[18-Sep-19 01:19 AM] PTYX#6840
Mm2 should support erc20 and USDT was added on mm1

[18-Sep-19 01:20 AM] PTYX#6840
I suspect that mm2 supports tether. Different graphical interfaces might have different coins available depending on their listing policies.

[18-Sep-19 04:41 AM] cipi#4502
USDT does not work, just read the comments in the posted issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/408
especially the last comment...

[18-Sep-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
hyperDEX comes bundled with mm2.0, we have to add the coins manually, we have not added any new coins as we are refactoring part of the code base.

[18-Sep-19 08:38 PM] Hember#5341
I installed hyperdex but it will not connect to marketmaker and then it just says that hyperdex will now relaunch.

[18-Sep-19 08:46 PM] Hember#5341
Can I find some logs to paste here?

[19-Sep-19 04:41 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
Are there any active offers on HyperDEX?

[19-Sep-19 04:41 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
I'm not seeing any

[19-Sep-19 04:41 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
not even with test coins

[19-Sep-19 04:41 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
do I need to have balances in each coin in order to see the relevant offers?

[19-Sep-19 04:50 AM] Acura#2748
There are many active orders on HyperDex

[19-Sep-19 04:51 AM] Acura#2748
Example dex/kmd

[19-Sep-19 04:56 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
Do I need to update the daily every day to keep seeing them?  Maybe I just need to restart.

[19-Sep-19 04:57 AM] Acura#2748
Do you use the nightlybuild ?

[19-Sep-19 05:00 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
Yeah, restarting it resulted in seeing a few offers now

[19-Sep-19 05:00 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
I'm using a three day old nightly

Getting this error trying to withdraw some USDT

[19-Sep-19 07:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@FTL_Ian which version did you download, we dont have a "stable" release out, the nightly is the latest working releases

[19-Sep-19 07:33 AM] Acura#2748
@FTL_Ian same offers, yes

[19-Sep-19 09:12 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
The latest nightly, @hyperDEX , from 9/17

[19-Sep-19 09:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Hmmm ok, wasnt there something about USDT or something

[19-Sep-19 09:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@FTL_Ian might be to do with that more than the mm having issues i think

[19-Sep-19 09:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think i read that in another channel

[19-Sep-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Have you tried any other coins?

[19-Sep-19 03:49 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Yes, I was able to send out bitcoin fine

[19-Sep-19 05:41 PM] cipi#4502

[19-Sep-19 06:06 PM] cipi#4502
@hyperDEX could be a good idea to remove USDT from the coins list, else more people will have their USDT stuck

[19-Sep-19 06:28 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
agreed

[19-Sep-19 08:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will do.

[20-Sep-19 12:07 PM] cryptopoli#6868
My experience with Hyperdex!  Yesterday Buy 1 placed Dex order, the order was marked with cancled, I thought nothing about it wol not be executed. This morning look in and see the order executed, in the history but still marked with Cancelled, KMD amount was debited, 0.99999 Dex were written well, ???????????????????????????

[20-Sep-19 12:09 PM] lollipop#1682
If you want DEX use chainswap. Works every time.

[20-Sep-19 12:10 PM] cryptopoli#6868
wat is chainswap?

[20-Sep-19 12:11 PM] lollipop#1682
Its also a dex

[20-Sep-19 12:14 PM] lollipop#1682
Perhabs it electron

[20-Sep-19 12:14 PM] lollipop#1682
Its called electron

[20-Sep-19 12:14 PM] lollipop#1682
Im not sure

[20-Sep-19 12:15 PM] lollipop#1682
Electronjs.Org

[20-Sep-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
electron is a popular chrome wrapper for javascript apps

[20-Sep-19 12:16 PM] lollipop#1682
Hmm

[20-Sep-19 12:16 PM] lollipop#1682
I use an app called chainswap for trading DEX

[20-Sep-19 12:17 PM] lollipop#1682
But I cant find it on google

[20-Sep-19 12:18 PM] lollipop#1682
Obe

[20-Sep-19 12:18 PM] lollipop#1682
One

[20-Sep-19 12:19 PM] lollipop#1682
You can use it to buy DEX

[20-Sep-19 12:19 PM] lollipop#1682
Works for me

[20-Sep-19 12:19 PM] lollipop#1682

[20-Sep-19 12:21 PM] lollipop#1682
What is the price for DEX on hyperdex?

[20-Sep-19 12:22 PM] cryptopoli#6868
Well I rather expect an answer to my story with Hyperdex KMD/InstantDEX Order? has anyone had any experience with Hyperdex? The prices are very different v 10-40KMD

[20-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Acura#2748
My trades on HyperDex, especially Dex Asset working fine

[20-Sep-19 12:24 PM] Acura#2748
Never had bad experience

[20-Sep-19 12:37 PM] cryptopoli#6868
yes it seems to work even if an order is marked ge-cancled, but that contradicts the general practice of an order withdrawal!!! and I would have hoped for an answer to that.

[20-Sep-19 06:21 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
@cipi , unfortunately MEW did not work with my HyperDEX seed words.  I also tried Exodus wallet and it doesn't see anything.

[20-Sep-19 06:24 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Just tried to withdraw BTC from HyperDEX and got this error:

Unhandled Promise Rejection
TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'amount' in undefined
    at app://-/bundle.js:142066:30

[20-Sep-19 06:27 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
ok, tried a smaller amount than the full amount and it worked - apparently that is the error that comes up if you type in the full amount in your wallet

[20-Sep-19 06:50 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
update- I was able to withdraw USDT by using an amount lower than the maximum

[20-Sep-19 09:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@cryptopoli can you send me a screenshot? Are you saying you did get it the DEX too?

There is some differences in the way mm2.0 handles the taker/maker model which the GUI does not account for and something we are trying to get done. Hopefully i will get some assistance to speed this up soon.

Currently the nightly releases somewhat work but please consider it a alpha until we get a refactored release out.

[20-Sep-19 09:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@FTL_Ian good to hear
