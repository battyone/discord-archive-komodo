Also fix vrsc electrum would be great üòÑ ‚ù§

hahaha thanks. @lukechilds can you take a look?

[15-Oct-18 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@0x03 is hosting the electrum server maybe judging from the link?

[15-Oct-18 09:17 PM] 0x03#8822
i am, `el0` is resyncing with the sapling release

[15-Oct-18 09:17 PM] 0x03#8822
it's about to be done

[15-Oct-18 09:20 PM] 0x03#8822
@Cryptoon also i've posted about this in the veruscoin discord üòÉ

[15-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aaaaah great! Will try firing up tomorrow then.

[15-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@lukechilds is it possible to have marketmaker launch anyway even if one of the electrum servers isnt working? Because now it just keeps loading because of the vrsc electrum. I think most people dont look at dev console, so they wont know whats causing hyperdex to load forever

[15-Oct-18 09:23 PM] 0x03#8822
yea, make sure to not test it in ~8-12hrs time, because then i'll be updating the other electrum server, and consequences will be the same üòÑ

[15-Oct-18 09:23 PM] 0x03#8822
i'll have to get a 3rd vrsc-electrum up as it seems

[15-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Any way to find out how I know we‚Äôre good?

[15-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Like check sync progress or something?

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] 0x03#8822
my console has that, yea üòÑ

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Haha ok inside info only

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] 0x03#8822
no sadly not in an automated fashion, but i'll be posting in the veruscoin-discord 'somewhere'

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] 0x03#8822
probably in #private-contributors

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway 8-12h wont be a problem, time for bed and work after that

[15-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

@lukechilds#2707 is it possible to have marketmaker launch anyway even if one of the electrum servers isnt working? Because now it just keeps loading because of the vrsc electrum. I think most people dont look at dev console, so they wont know whats causing hyperdex to load forever
```

@Cryptoon it should do that already, there is something like a 5s timeout. If the electrum server doesn't respond in that time `marketmaker` should ignore it and move on. If mm is hanging on an electrum server then it sounds like there's a bug in mm. Unfortunately we can't tell it to stop from our end, we can't communicate with it until it's finished.

If you can reproduce the issue are you able to report it to mm devs?

[16-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@lukechilds electrum servers are fixed, so now I dont have that issue anymore

[16-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But before I could just keep repeating the issue where I restarted hyper and it kept loading on that electrum server for vrsc that wasnt working. If I wanted to close hyper it said 'could not connect to marketmaker'

[16-Oct-18 12:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
ohhh, I see

[16-Oct-18 12:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
so most likely this is actually an issue with Electrum

[16-Oct-18 12:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
If @0x03 was resyncing then the actual coin daemon on his node would (I think?) be locked. So we probably did successfully connect to the electrum server, but there was an issue with Electrum <-> coin daemon communication on the actual server that was hanging.

[16-Oct-18 12:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think Electrum servers should be resyncing regularly, so this likely isn't a huge problem. But if people running electrum servers bring down electrum while they're resyncing coin daemons that would likely solve the issue

[16-Oct-18 12:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
// cc @0x03 @cipi üòÉ

[16-Oct-18 12:34 PM] 0x03#8822
oh, it is down during the resync of the chain (i.e. the outside/p2p port is not bound to by electrumx)

[16-Oct-18 04:32 PM] cipi#4502
the problem isn't there on CLI, when i enable electrums and they are unreachable, it simply takes longer, but mm is showing an error and continues with the other electrums

[17-Oct-18 05:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's odd

[17-Oct-18 05:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's possible that we have an outdated version of mm, but I don't that that's it, I'm not aware of any recent changes to the way electrum timeout is handled

[17-Oct-18 06:07 AM] cipi#4502
i also observed two different situations
1. the method "electrum" returns with an error saying the server is unreachable, so does the console output
2. the method "electrum" says everything is fine, but console says node is dead
on CLI this does not seem to make any difference, but i can imagine GUIs are relying on the info that mm returns (not the output in console)
i don't know where the difference between this 2 fails is... could be the difference is that one tcp connection returns "Connection refused" immediately and the other case is where Firewalls do their part and the connection attempt doesn't return anything, it is simply stuck... that may also cause the large delays when starting mm... it makes a difference if a connection attempt is refused immediately or if mm waits for the OS timeout... could be a good idea to try to cover this in the code by playing with the timeout-options, but i fear i don't have the knowledge to be able to tell this for sure

[17-Oct-18 06:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
The GUI works fine with either an error or success response

[17-Oct-18 06:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
if we get a success response but it actually errors that could definitely cause issues

[17-Oct-18 06:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it wouldn't just hang, it would move on to the next electrum server

[17-Oct-18 06:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help @cipi

[17-Oct-18 06:16 AM] cipi#4502
yes, you are right, it shouldn't hang forever... but i didn't experienced this with CLI, only that it takes much longer if i have bad electrums in my config

[18-Oct-18 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833

@lukechilds

[19-Oct-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
@vrcninja What's your total balance and how much were you trying to withdraw?

[19-Oct-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
or if you don't want to say publicly; was the amount you were trying to withdraw very close to your total amount?

[20-Oct-18 02:42 PM] vrcninja#5651
@lukechilds That was the problem. I was trying to withdraw everything and when I dropped it down the transaction went through

[20-Oct-18 02:42 PM] vrcninja#5651

@lukechilds @pbca26 found electrums for UFO: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/176
and also updated electrums for CRW: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/CRW
i would recommend you to use this repo directly, there are probably more changes then this 2 that are not HyperDEX/Agama

this file contains the VTC servers https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/master/app/marketmaker/supported-currencies.js#L2152
it changed recently, so i simply suppose you have the old config... but without knowing the electrum server you are trying to connect to, i can't tell, you would have to check

@cipi Did you take down the VTC Electrum server already?

[22-Oct-18 04:54 PM] cipi#4502
yes, i am running out of RAM.. they had 0 connections by that time, so i thought they are already switched

[22-Oct-18 04:54 PM] modereck#4269

[22-Oct-18 04:55 PM] sindresorhus#8187
In the future, a warning before taking it down would be nice.

[22-Oct-18 04:55 PM] sindresorhus#8187
You said you would take it down when there are no more connections to it, so I assumed it was no rush.

[22-Oct-18 04:56 PM] cipi#4502
there were no connections when i took them down... will write a warning next time
