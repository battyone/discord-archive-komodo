@Nabob sent that to me and i had a look... bobdeposit and alicepayment were done, both are unspent though... next would have been bob doing bobpayment, but that one is missing... if you call swapstatus for that swap it should be "rewinded" (alice gets back alicepayment and bob bobdeposit)

[03-Oct-18 04:53 AM] cipi#4502
yes, like this `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"swapstatus\",\"requestid\":3076945675,\"quoteid\":1167555031}"`

[03-Oct-18 04:54 AM] Nabob#5004
👆  That issue is with other user @strugglebus

[03-Oct-18 04:55 AM] cipi#4502
could be strugglebus was alice and tolken was bob in this failed swap?

[03-Oct-18 04:56 AM] tolken#2655
Yes, my bob died right at start

[03-Oct-18 04:57 AM] tolken#2655

hmmm, both are still unspent... if there is already a .finished file for that swap on bob, could be you will have to remove that and repeat the swapstatus-call again...

[03-Oct-18 05:03 AM] tolken#2655
Sure

[03-Oct-18 05:05 AM] Nabob#5004
so, swap Now waiting at 4/5 need to complete alice spend

[03-Oct-18 05:08 AM] tolken#2655
There we go, I see some action now

[03-Oct-18 05:09 AM] cipi#4502

if alice now calls swapstatus again, she should be able to spend alicepayment: https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/ffb1d45808635c95284cb7cea53093be8380048c5fc9b2c5794f79a6d607193a

[03-Oct-18 05:17 AM] tolken#2655
Thank you @lukechilds for calling attention to this, @cipi for your help!

[03-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Nabob#5004
@strugglebus  @Hermes 👆 
Thanks @cipi  for a quick look

[03-Oct-18 06:15 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds @strugglebus Hi, in case of stuck swaps it's required to provide MM logs and swap data from `DB/SWAPS` directory. In this particular case I need to know bob deposit tx id to retrieve Bob PrivN (in case bob refunded the deposit). Please provide this info in PM and I'll be able to help.

[03-Oct-18 06:18 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Could you please point @strugglebus how he's able to find logs and SWAPS data?

[03-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Nabob#5004
@artem.pikulin  Seems issue resolved, bob node stopped suddenly, after he started and initiated `swapstatus` call. then, everything goes fine
struglebus is alice
tolken is bob

[03-Oct-18 07:10 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Nabob https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bD7WSJat5QmzpKtpmdF5AMi2UKAGUXAmSE - the address reported as APayment and KMD is still there, need to send it back to struglebus.

[03-Oct-18 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i think strugglebus just needs to do a swapstatus

[03-Oct-18 10:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
Opening HyperDEX will do that automatically

[03-Oct-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
But if SWAPS data is still needed then you can get that by clicking `Debug > Show App Data` in HyperDEX
Then inside the directory that pops up navigate to: `marketmaker/DB/SWAPS`

[03-Oct-18 10:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@strugglebus Please follow steps Luke posted above, if HyperDEX restart doesn't help please send the swap data to me in PM.

[03-Oct-18 01:54 PM] coiin#0708
I need some kind of support in Hyperdex or Barterdex.  In Hyperdex i'm able to take a trade but nothing happens. Still pending/open after one our. In Braterdex thesame.  Anyone could help?

@yo88 hyperdex is another trading software built on same barterdex network, same API calls, different gui and features.  barterdex is the "reference" of anything that is possible on the dex network.   hyperdex is a polished version of the functions for trading.

[04-Oct-18 02:58 PM] d_lzz#0109
The latest HyperDEX doesn't work on my Debian Stretch.  There is only the screen that asks if I want to add HyperDEX to  the menu. After that it just "hangs", nada. The terminal doesn't give any errors. The previous version also didn't work. The versions before that did start correctly. I have to add that I'm testing it inside Whonix, although I doubt it has anything to do with it.

[04-Oct-18 02:59 PM] d_lzz#0109
I'm using the AppImage

[04-Oct-18 04:13 PM] qmc#4355
HyperDEX requires only 2 electrum servers right ?

[04-Oct-18 04:14 PM] qmc#4355

You could probably get a bot to test and merge this to be honest...something in combination with travis

[05-Oct-18 12:58 AM] qmc#4355

[05-Oct-18 01:05 AM] qmc#4355
is hyperdex volume counted as barterdex volume on CMC?

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] qmc#4355
Alright, hopefully the end users/traders understand it better (and we'll post a video tutorial whenever we are listed)

[05-Oct-18 01:42 AM] qmc#4355
Volume seems low to say the least, marketing issue or usage issue?

[05-Oct-18 02:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
We intentionally haven't marketed HyperDEX yet, because we don't think it's ready

[05-Oct-18 02:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's still beta

[05-Oct-18 02:37 AM] lukechilds#2707

Seeing this in hyperDex 0.1.3 although I seem to be able to continue. Since that error came up I’m 3/5 through swap steps buying bch with kmd.  Confirmed Alice payment, waiting quite some time for my fee. Not sure if it’s still going or not.

[07-Oct-18 03:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
just FYI for everyone  here, I'm focussing mainly on claiming KMD interest on the Ledger for the time being

[07-Oct-18 03:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm still working on HyperDEX

[07-Oct-18 03:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
but Ledger interest is my priority at the moment

@sindresorhus is probably a better point of contact for HyperDEX related issues for the time being
