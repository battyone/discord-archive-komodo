[02-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you are selecting withdraw max

[02-Aug-18 12:53 PM] monokh#4656
@Cryptoon  i was inputting only a small value. I think it's something to do with marketmaker, i cannot see any orderbooks and sending orders hangs as well. what is a good way to troubleshoot the marketmaker?

[02-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm that's weird

[02-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which version are you using? @monokh

[02-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There was a new version released yesterday/today ish

[02-Aug-18 12:58 PM] monokh#4656
i have the latest version. Barterdex shows orders though

[02-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[02-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I had the same issue with previous version on mac

[02-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362

will take a look at this tomorrow morning

[02-Aug-18 06:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
just checking @monokh but are you running HyperDEX and BarterDEX at the same time?

[02-Aug-18 06:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
if so, they will conflict and only one will work

[02-Aug-18 10:17 PM] monokh#4656
@lukechilds only running one at a time but I do have both "available", BarterDex i start via NPM and HyperDex as DMG

[02-Aug-18 10:28 PM] c2k#4915
i am unable to get my BDEX or HDEX open. when sign into HDEX i get an error msg popup saying "marketmaker crashed" then "hyperdex will now relaunch"
...then when i click ok i get an "unhandled promise rejection"
TypeError: Cannot read property "focus" of null followed by 5 more lines of stuff

anyone know whats going on?

[03-Aug-18 04:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[03-Aug-18 07:14 PM] GoldmanSocks#8569
Quick question, so there is no way to add a non-stardard non-komodo address based coin to hyperdex? The reason I ask is because there is a HUGE need for anytype of exchange for a sia-fork coin called hyperspace that currently has nothing to exchange with and people are resorting to private escrow via members in discord. Hyperdex would really be a great platform for this.

[03-Aug-18 07:24 PM] GoldmanSocks#8569
And since they had a huge airdrop for sia holder it would be wise to be one of the first DEX services to be able to support P2P trades in it. Plus with all the legal trouble in SIA with the failed manufacturer of SC1 miners made in the usa im thinking a lot of sia holders will move mining and coins to hyperspace IMO..

[03-Aug-18 07:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@GoldmanSocks you should ask Cipi in #dev-tradebots but if it's not bitcoin-based it's not possible yet

[05-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Erast#4164
Hi, i,m not sure if my BarterDEX (ver. 1.1.1. on Linux) works properly and would appreciate some clarification. When I try to buy some BTC for KMD I don't see my order, though the terminal shows that something is going on (fill.1  gtc.1) and then there's  message  saying "time expired for Alice_request". It then repeats and  also information about other requests occur

[05-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> Did you try a "good until cancelled" order?

[05-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Erast#4164
no

[05-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Erast#4164
should I?

[05-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> That's what I usually do. My orders always show up but it might take a little bit

[05-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Erast#4164
I will try it, thanks

[05-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> Yeah no proboem

[05-Aug-18 04:32 PM] Erast#4164
Now I can see my order at last

[05-Aug-18 04:34 PM] Erast#4164
In My Offers, however not in the Buyers section

[05-Aug-18 06:58 PM] Erast#4164
How long on average does it take until you find a trade partner?

[06-Aug-18 04:53 AM] jspook16#3059
it depends on what you are trying to trade. there isnt alot of volume on all trade pairs yet

[06-Aug-18 04:53 AM] jspook16#3059
what are you trading?

The below issue means you're being rate-limited by CMC. We need to setup some kind of cache server for HyperDEX:

// @lukechilds

[06-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@sindresorhus ok, but is that also the reason why my orderbooks won't load?

[06-Aug-18 08:54 PM] Erast#4164
@jspook16 i am trying to buy BTC for KMD

[06-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Erast#4164
@jspook16  buying BTC for KMD

[07-Aug-18 04:11 AM] jspook16#3059
you need to look at your UTXOs and try different amounts. You could look at the BTC orders and see what size their UTXOs are and try to match one.

[07-Aug-18 04:12 AM] jspook16#3059
@Erast Have you tried on hyperdex? that might be easier

[07-Aug-18 05:57 AM] Erast#4164
I guess I'll try hyperdex

[07-Aug-18 07:51 AM] Erast#4164
I am trying different amounts on hyperdex and they are all mismatched. Could the reason be not enough utxo for a fee?

[07-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Erast#4164
Anyway thanks for your help @jspook16

[07-Aug-18 08:08 PM] 135b987#6684
Howw do i create a Order on hyper dex? if i buy or sell for a amount not currently offered by set orders?

[07-Aug-18 08:09 PM] 135b987#6684
i tried to play around and got the error code -9999

[07-Aug-18 08:10 PM] 135b987#6684
its not exactly described in the kb https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/322240534/How+to+view+Open+Orders+and+Swap+History

[07-Aug-18 08:14 PM] 135b987#6684
are the orderbooks for all dex based on komodo the same? lets say barterdex and hyperdex orders?

[07-Aug-18 08:15 PM] 135b987#6684
since the dex is only the gui?

[08-Aug-18 08:36 AM] crumb#2550
@135b987 yes, HyperDEX and BarterDEX have the same underlying orderbooks

[08-Aug-18 09:19 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@Cryptoon If you mean the rate-limit issue, it should not, but could potentially, since Marketmaker (which handles the orderbooks) talks to CMC too, and not being able to talk to CMC might block its other operations, like getting the orderbooks. @lukechilds Would probably be able to give a more accurate answer.

[08-Aug-18 09:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon I don't think CMC rate limiting will stop your order books showing up. I often get rate limited by CMC and my order book still shows. Sometimes it does take a while for them to sync. Can you view the requests in the network tab and verify they are getting through to market maker?

You could also try running `_api.debug({method: 'getpeers'})` in the console to see how many peers you are connected too. If you're poorly connected that may be why

[08-Aug-18 09:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
But sometimes and on certain networks it does just take a very long time for order books to show, this is something I've noticed myself and is a problem with the underlying `marketmaker`  daemon. We poll it once a second for order book data and as soon as it gives us some info, we show it.

[08-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll see if I have time later to test it, will get back to you

Did you follow the installation instructions and delete your trade history if you're upgrading from an old version?

Can you check the network tab in dev tools

[10-Aug-18 12:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
there should be lots of requests

[10-Aug-18 12:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
alternating between `portfolio` and `orderbook`

[10-Aug-18 12:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can view the direct response from `marketmaker` there
