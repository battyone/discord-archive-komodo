[10-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but rebooting hyper always fixed that

[10-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But now from booting it also greys out when pressing buy/sell

[10-Aug-18 02:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
If you view the network tab as your press buy/sell do all the requests stop?

[10-Aug-18 02:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
we grey out the button until mm responds to the order request

[10-Aug-18 02:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
and it can't do anything else while it's processing that request so it blocks everything

[10-Aug-18 02:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
normally it doesn't take too long but occasionally it can take quite a while

[10-Aug-18 02:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
and I think you will probably need atleast one peer before placing an order

[10-Aug-18 02:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
otherwise I don't think you'll be able to broadcast it to the network

[10-Aug-18 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah after I restarted it just wasnt connecting to peers anymore

[10-Aug-18 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is probably why the button was greyed out

[10-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
very odd

[10-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
it really sounds like some kind of networking/firewall issue on your end

[10-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the fact that you get the same issue at home and at work

[10-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
and the fact that the dev build worked ok

[10-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't really support that theory

[10-Aug-18 03:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
could you maybe try alternating between the dev build and the prebuilt binary a few times

[10-Aug-18 03:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
let it run for a few mins, then check the connected peers

[10-Aug-18 03:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you try on dev build, then on prebuilt and do that about three times on each

[10-Aug-18 03:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you consistently get peers on the dev build but not on the pre built release at least we can be sure it's something to do with the release build

[10-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm gonna have to try that in weekend, got a lot of work left and need to go out with the in laws in a bit

[10-Aug-18 03:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah no worries

[10-Aug-18 03:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
ping me if you need a hand

[10-Aug-18 03:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for taking the time to look into it üëç

[10-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
no worries, sent someone with the same mac build as me a message that they test as well

[10-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
to see if orderbooks load yes/no

[10-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok had my brother test it, same problem

[10-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
fresh download

[10-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and he is at his place and on his laptop, so again completely different network/machine setting

[10-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
will try the toggle between dev and github build tomorrow if I have the time, but I *think* the problem is at the level of the build

[10-Aug-18 04:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's very strange

[10-Aug-18 04:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
I can run the latest build fine on my machine

[10-Aug-18 04:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
do you mind saying what country/location you're in?

[10-Aug-18 04:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's possible you could have weak network connectivity to the rest of the network

[10-Aug-18 04:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
from a geographical perspective

[10-Aug-18 04:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
although that would mean the issue would persist on the dev build and BarterDEX GUI too which it doesn't

@lukechilds Belgium, internet connection shouldnt be a problem

[11-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And barter works

you should plug eslint to your project

[17-Aug-18 10:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
@OsTa did you set a custom marketmaker url?

[17-Aug-18 10:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
and we do use eslint

[17-Aug-18 10:52 AM] OsTa#2589
nop

first time I run hyperdex on osx

Can you try going to `Debug > Show App Data` then open the `config.json` file

[17-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
and send me the output

hmm works now

[17-Aug-18 01:12 PM] OsTa#2589
only the first launch has failed

[17-Aug-18 01:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
odd

[17-Aug-18 01:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
let us know if you experience it again

[17-Aug-18 05:33 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Today I tried to use both Barterdex and HyperDex several times. Both failed. I downloaded Hyperdex 12 and retried. The result was same. It gave error message like "not connecting to market place". I tried again in the evening. Maybe problem with my machine. I will try it on other machine.

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] DanMercurius#7990
Hello! I tried to update my Barterdex to 1.1.1 today. When I start it, I get error messages for all electrum wallets of my coins previously added to 'startup'. Additionally all coins come up as 'undefined'

[18-Aug-18 12:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
Hi @DanMercurius this channel is for HyperDEX development

[18-Aug-18 12:47 PM] DanMercurius#7990
Hi @lukechilds ! thanks, could you please point me to the barterdex channel? can't find it...

[18-Aug-18 12:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
To be honest I'm not sure one exists

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
you could try contacting @grewalsatinder but I'm not sure he works on it much anymore

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] DanMercurius#7990
it states on the komodo website and github to please test barterdex and give feedback in the BarterDex channel on discord...

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] DanMercurius#7990
ok so should I transfer my assets from barterdex to hyperdex? 
Would be great to communicate discontinuation of barterdex to users...

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's discontinued

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think Grewal just moved on to something else

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm really not too sure

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not involved with BarterDEX development

[18-Aug-18 12:50 PM] DanMercurius#7990
^^ per definition not working on sth anymore is 'discontinued' . language fails again xD

[18-Aug-18 12:50 PM] DanMercurius#7990
is there a best practice to follow when moving assets from barterdex to hyperdex?

[18-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
the seeds are compatible

[18-Aug-18 12:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
so instead of creating a new wallet in HyperDEX

[18-Aug-18 12:51 PM] DanMercurius#7990
Wonderful (:

[18-Aug-18 12:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
click restore

[18-Aug-18 12:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
and paste in your BarterDEX seed

[18-Aug-18 12:51 PM] DanMercurius#7990
awesome, thanks for the valuable info!!

@lukechilds don't scare ppl unnecessarily.... I'm not gone yet üòÑ

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
hehe sorry

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
np

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
I thought I heard you were working on something else now like CC

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, I'm on to token exchange GUI which is CC

[18-Aug-18 12:55 PM] DanMercurius#7990
not scared that easily ^^ one quick question:
@grewalsatinder  Should I make a backup of my legacy coin db (which seems corrupted now, since all coins are shown as 'undefined) before resetting it in 1.1.1?

[18-Aug-18 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@DanMercurius don't need to fiddle with your BarterDEX data folder. just follow the video if you get it, and that should solve your problem.

[18-Aug-18 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I assume you are upgrading from 0.x.x version to 1.x.x ?

[18-Aug-18 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's the the case you have to follow the video help.

[18-Aug-18 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no way around.

[18-Aug-18 12:58 PM] DanMercurius#7990
correct. the video says to reset coin db, however dropdown shows not 3 coins but all coins as undefined..

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Hermes and @SHossain can help you step by step.

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] DanMercurius#7990
if I have my seed, there should be nothing to worry about when resetting the coin db, correct?

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
seed is the most import.

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] DanMercurius#7990
ok then I just go for it ^^

[18-Aug-18 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
make sure you follow the video help *exactly* as is. don't skip a step.
