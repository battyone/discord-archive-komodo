‚òù That was trying to trade KMD/AE, alice matches with a Bob but never sends the initial tx so it times out

[01-Oct-18 05:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
cc @artem.pikulin

[01-Oct-18 05:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
There also obvs a huge amount of `ETH RPC response parse failed: (null)!` and `curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server` errors getting spammed

[01-Oct-18 05:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
so somerthing's definitely not right

[01-Oct-18 06:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds could you please run `curl --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST 195.201.0.6:8555` from your machine where you have a lot of network errors?

[01-Oct-18 08:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
@artem.pikulin 
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x62264d","id":1}
```

[01-Oct-18 08:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
Btw, I tried tethering to my phone and I didn't get all those network errors

[01-Oct-18 08:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it could be possible that it was an issue with my connection

[01-Oct-18 08:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
however the bug still exists

[01-Oct-18 08:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
Alice still didn't send the initial TX after matching

There is no connect/connected event in latest log, did it happen?

New beta version of HyperDEX is out which fixes some issues people were seeing, in particular, the `Document update conflict` error.

[01-Oct-18 11:02 AM] cipi#4502
i also had the problem of "SWAP never started" couple of times... bob then shows
```didnt get valid data after 120
error waitsend pubkeys```
the reason was always the same: i forgot to stop my JDownloader on alice before starting the swap
with a running download in the background on alice, 90% of the swap attempts failed

[01-Oct-18 01:03 PM] tolken#2655
For what it‚Äôs worth, I just successfully did a kmd buy using eth, using cli.

[01-Oct-18 01:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
Which mm version?

[01-Oct-18 01:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
And probably unrelated but are you using Electrum or native for kmd

[01-Oct-18 03:33 PM] tolken#2655
1.0.717, possibly 1.0707. I can double check if you need to know precise version - I‚Äôm going by when I downloaded it relatively to release. Using native kmd.

[01-Oct-18 03:35 PM] tolken#2655
I have some test eth bob online if you need to test.

[01-Oct-18 04:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah if you could let me know the precise version that would be great

[01-Oct-18 04:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
mm should dump it in the terminal on startup

[01-Oct-18 04:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
than I can test that version on my end and see if it works

[01-Oct-18 04:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, if you wouldn't mind downloading the mm binaries we bundle with HyperDEX and use them via the CLI seeing if it still works for you that would be incredibly helpful

Hi

[01-Oct-18 11:30 PM] qmc#4355
Anyone around?
Wondering if there is any difference between using Electrum and/or ElectrumX for our coin (that we would love to list with you)

[01-Oct-18 11:34 PM] qmc#4355
@anyone üòÉ

[01-Oct-18 11:35 PM] qmc#4355
Actually @lukechilds is the right address, I've heard

[02-Oct-18 01:27 AM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds you got it, I‚Äôll give it a shot tonight/tomorrow morning.

[02-Oct-18 02:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
@tolken  thanks so much

[02-Oct-18 02:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
@qmc not to sure what you mean, are you asking wether you should run https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server or https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx on your server?

[02-Oct-18 02:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
If so then definitely ElectrumX. They both support the electrum protocol but `electrum-server` is outdated and unmentioned, ElectrumX is the official replacement.

[02-Oct-18 02:09 AM] qmc#4355
Wasn't sure the protocol was backward compatible, thanks @lukechilds

[02-Oct-18 02:09 AM] qmc#4355
*or different

[02-Oct-18 04:04 AM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds confirmed mm 1.0.717 via terminal output. I‚Äôll see if I can test another trade in the morning with the hdex mm.

[02-Oct-18 12:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
@tolken Thanks, I just checked on 1.0.717 and I'm still getting the same issue ü§î

[02-Oct-18 12:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
Also, do you experience the issue when you use HyperDEX?

[02-Oct-18 02:33 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds   Successful bdex cli swap using 1.0.707 mm from the link you provided.

[02-Oct-18 02:35 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm a bit of a late starter using hyperdex, just tried it for first time a week ago. Really like the interface. I tried it through a vm (parallels on a Mac) using Mint Linux and it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll try again on another computer config soon.

[02-Oct-18 02:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
Buying KMD with an ERC20 worked?

[02-Oct-18 02:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
normal coins are working for me

[02-Oct-18 02:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's specifically ERC20 that's the issue

[02-Oct-18 02:36 PM] tolken#2655
Buying kmd, yes.

[02-Oct-18 02:36 PM] tolken#2655
But it‚Äôs a kmd/eth swap.  You can do that fine?

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
I actually only tried ERC20, I will try ETH

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
pretty late here

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] tolken#2655
There are no eth bobs. I‚Äôm the only eth bob now afaik.

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
will test in the morning

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I can spin one up

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help

[02-Oct-18 02:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
appreciate it

[02-Oct-18 02:38 PM] tolken#2655
Np, thanks for all your help and explanations in the past. Least I can do üòÉ

[02-Oct-18 02:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
btw, re HyperDEX not working in a VM, there are known issues with mm and flaky networking

[02-Oct-18 02:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
and you can only have one mm instance per public IP

[02-Oct-18 02:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
so could possibly be some to do with that

[02-Oct-18 02:39 PM] tolken#2655
Reverting back to my old setup and putting my eth bob baxk online. I‚Äôll get some erc20 online next and test that.

[02-Oct-18 02:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
Legend üëå

[02-Oct-18 02:39 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm isolating mm to unique ip

[02-Oct-18 02:40 PM] tolken#2655
even routed hyperdex through a different network. I think it‚Äôs a clash with the vm config

[02-Oct-18 02:41 PM] tolken#2655
Has many flavors of piggybacking on the host network.

[02-Oct-18 02:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, possibly, re Mint, we only officially test HyperDEX on Ubuntu cos manually testing loads of distros would be a nightmare, but it should work on Mint. If you submit an issue on GitHub with details on the issues you had on Mint we'll look into it.

[02-Oct-18 02:41 PM] tolken#2655
Not in love with mint, I‚Äôll probably just move to Ubuntu next to eliminate more variables.

[02-Oct-18 04:31 PM] qmc#4355
@lukechilds what's the listing time like once we have electrum up and running? any procedure or just need to be listed on barterdex first ?

[02-Oct-18 06:12 PM] strugglebus#2266
how do I locate my userpass on the windos gui

@qmc actually adding you to HyperDEX is very quick and easy, main thing is getting you a custom icon added which can take a bit longer.

@lukechilds waiting on other dev to setup electrumx, thanks!

[03-Oct-18 01:03 AM] qmc#4355
Also waiting on the BarterDEX merge - isn't that a must before getting listed on HyperDEX too ?

[03-Oct-18 01:05 AM] qmc#4355
Ohhh I see what you mean

[03-Oct-18 01:07 AM] qmc#4355
What if we don't have a website (out of choice, really)

[03-Oct-18 01:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
No, you don't need to be listed on BarterDEX first, as long as we have all your coin params

[03-Oct-18 01:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
easiest way is to update this repo: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins/

[03-Oct-18 01:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c we have a HyperDEX user with funds stuck for over 12 hours, kickstarting doesn't seem to help and mm will not reclaim the funds.

You can view the log from HyperDEX here: https://pastebin.com/xJAbqCVC

You can see mm sent `alicepayment` but the swap never progressed from that. The funds are currently in this address: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bD7WSJat5QmzpKtpmdF5AMi2UKAGUXAmSE

I believe this issue happened to me before and you talked me through how to manually find the temp keys in the mm DB and created a redeem TX. Are you able to this with our user or cc someone else who can do this

funds stuck for 12 hours doesn't sound fun though

[03-Oct-18 01:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
@qmc great, then it looks like a custom icon is all that's needed for HyperDEX integration

[03-Oct-18 01:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, the marketmaker daemon we build on is still in early stages, sometimes these things happen, @artem.pikulin and @artemciy_dice are making great progress on mmv2 which should resolve these issues.

[03-Oct-18 01:32 AM] qmc#4355
How often are they? Was just about to prepare the LP for QMC

[03-Oct-18 01:32 AM] qmc#4355
The issues I mean

[03-Oct-18 01:40 AM] dan.#2473
Very rare if not edge cases that can be patched. I've done 10k swaps on cli and got every Satoshi back

[03-Oct-18 01:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
you would be better off asking in the #dev-tradebots channel as that is more of a marketmaker question than a HyperDEX question, but the issue aren't too regular. But they are often enough for us not remove the beta tag from HyperDEX

[03-Oct-18 03:32 AM] qmc#4355
cool, good to know!

[03-Oct-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just use a proper release of merketmaker and make sure your internet doesn't go down during swap and it usually fine. I had one instance a long time ago where I lost about $500 that was never able to be recovered. Dont think I have seen that particilar thing happen to any person ever apart from me... it wsa 99.9999% likley something I did, and stupid of me to be transfering that much $$$ at once on the wrong version of marketmaker üòÇ

[03-Oct-18 04:37 AM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds it likely isn‚Äôt lost. It‚Äôs BTC.

[03-Oct-18 04:37 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve had it take days to come back.

[03-Oct-18 04:38 AM] tolken#2655
12h isn‚Äôt a guarantee or a maximum time.

[03-Oct-18 04:38 AM] tolken#2655
Btw, that trade was with my bob. Had a glitch that took my mm down briefly, no fault of mm.

[03-Oct-18 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont have time to troubleshoot it. it sounds like a reclaim is needed, which would happen after bob side does his reclaiming. BTC txfees went steeply up the other day and is the likely cause. with BTC the timeouts are set long, so as long as bob is still running his node, you can reclaim a bit faster. if he isnt then it invokes a different claim, but for that you need to wait a bit longer. you do get 12.5% more though

[03-Oct-18 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
cipi would know best how to recover

[03-Oct-18 04:46 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi any way I can speed up the reclaim? My bob has been active all day, was only down for a minute or so after it went down as the swap started.

[03-Oct-18 04:47 AM] tolken#2655
Marketmaker marked the job as finished.

[03-Oct-18 04:47 AM] cipi#4502
