Is VRSC in hyperdex yet? Their trading channel begs for a market

[18-Jun-18 03:43 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@jorian We need an Electrum server for it. Needs to be added here first: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums (That's the list we source from)

[18-Jun-18 03:44 PM] jorian#4555
ah, and i remember @cipi saying something about their different algo making it difficult to create an electrum instance

[18-Jun-18 03:45 PM] jorian#4555
is that still the case? so no electrum yet?

[slack] <vrcninja> @Anyone else having issues withdrawing from Hyperdex?

[19-Jun-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> @vrcninja you can always load the same keys into agama or barterdex and make a transfer. Its not a withdraw in the same sense as a CEX.

[19-Jun-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> I tried Agama as well but it is having server connection issues. I'm wondering if the same thing is impacting Barterdex

[19-Jun-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> @jspook16

[19-Jun-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> are you in electrum mode?

[19-Jun-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> yes

[19-Jun-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> Are there issues with the electrum servers now?

[19-Jun-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> I've tried Barterdex as well.

[19-Jun-18 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> 1.0.7 newest version

[19-Jun-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> It basically just gives a message that the transaction did not complete, please try again.

[19-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> It's possible. Actually now that you mention it, I was unable to make kmd transactions yesterday from Agama Mobile.

[19-Jun-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Nabob> Please explain, what are the agama issues you are facing

[20-Jun-18 02:57 PM] Acura#2748
I find it strange with HyperDex my sell order does not stay in (unmatched) and with BarterDex my order remains constantly active.

[20-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Hermes#6934
Most probably you need to make a new sell order

[20-Jun-18 09:10 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
I can only get about 1 out of 50 orders filled on the DEX.  I've played around with breaking up my UTXOs.  What else can I try to be more successful?

[20-Jun-18 09:13 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
I'm clicking on a sell order to have it select the price for me, by the way.

[20-Jun-18 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
increase price a bit

Is there a way to make hyper **not** use electrum?

[22-Jun-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Not at the moment. Our main focus is for grandmas. Once we have done we may look into native

[22-Jun-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Also good news, the work needed for translations in HyperDEX is done so expect that to be rolled out soon

Electrum server not found for XSG, last time I looked at hyperDEX.  Any workaround to get it working?

[23-Jun-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might be the wrong one possibly. I might not have changed them over. I can check with TXID and ge this fixed. Thanks for reporting. Not sure there is any bobs up for XSG though.

[23-Jun-18 05:07 AM] 7rank#9952
@blackjok3r happy to help

[23-Jun-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just finishing some things off for the scaletest, cleaned up the code and fixed a few things. Need to start the test to make sure I didnt break anyhting then I will DM you.

>Is there a way to make hyper not use electrum?

If you really want your own full node you could run your own Electrum server locally

[23-Jun-18 06:47 AM] criptobear#6402
i am trying to sell beer for pizza on hyperdex, i clicked on the beer buy orders and created the order now after 5 minutes of ‚Äúpending‚Äù it became ‚Äúunmatched‚Äù this is what i don‚Äôt understand if i accepted the price of the order in existence why it is not executed? (it says timed out)

[23-Jun-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
could be anything... I did just take down all my bobs. Try increasing the price a bit. I dont know if anyone else has good bobs up for that pair.

[23-Jun-18 06:58 AM] criptobear#6402
yeah i see no orders now

[23-Jun-18 07:00 AM] criptobear#6402
i tried again and now it is all grayed out cannot use it  at all

[23-Jun-18 07:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@webworker01 which os? I have an issue with hyper where it turns unresponsive after 10ish minutes, think it must be marketmaker or something. Clicking buy etc doesnt do anything anymore. Is on osx

[23-Jun-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Havent tested latest alpha yet though but it was still there on 6

[23-Jun-18 09:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
@webworker01 thanks for the detailed feedback, all of those issues appear to be issues with `marketmaker` though, not HyperDEX, we literally just send/display data to/from `marketmaker`

[23-Jun-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
>*sometimes the buy/sell buttons get greyed out or blink and don't seem to do anything and the app needs a restart
We grey out the button until `marketmaker` responds to the buy API request. Due it's blocking single threaded nature sometimes requests can take a very long time

>*sometimes the bobs don't show up anymore and the app needs a restart
We poll `marketmaker` for the order book once per second and display it's output. If orders aren't showing up it's because `marketmaker` isn't telling us about them

>*sometimes it seems that the bids/asks displayed either aren't really there or aren't responding to being matched properly
Same as above really.

>*almost always need to enter an offer higher than what is displayed but when the swap is completed you get close to the price displayed
We just pass the values directly to `marketmaker`, all order matching logic is in `marketmaker`.

>*not sure how utxos are handled but as i get down to the bottom of what i sent in to buy with the trades aren't close to my amount i wish to buy anymore where they were closer in the beginning with a single utxo, i need to now make multiple offers to get to my target buy amount

We don't handle UTXOs at all, it's entirely handled by `marketmaker`

[23-Jun-18 09:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
Unfortunately we can't fix any of these things in HyperDEX, it needs to be fixed in `marketmaker`. There is a v2 re-write in the works that will hopefully resolve these issues

[23-Jun-18 09:34 AM] criptobear#6402
i cannot remember i have to send my self in hyperdex coqui to have utxo right?

[23-Jun-18 09:39 AM] criptobear#6402

Possible but probably not a good idea

[23-Jun-18 11:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
so many edge cases and potential bugs could creep in

[23-Jun-18 11:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
although I agree, if it worked correctly it would provide a better experience for the user

[23-Jun-18 11:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
if we restart we can guarantee the UI and `marketmaker` are in sync

@webworker01 I can confirm a similar experience with hyperDEX alpha 6.  Kmd/hush trades.  1/7 success rate, even though I select sell orders and leave the price unchanged.

[23-Jun-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you increased the price a bit?

[23-Jun-18 03:59 PM] 7rank#9952
@jl777c I've tried that as well with limited success.  It doesn't always guarantee the swap.

[23-Jun-18 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I just pushed a possible fix to improve things a lot at the core level, if it does, then when the update gets into hyperdex, things should be significantly better

[23-Jun-18 04:01 PM] 7rank#9952
@jl777c thank you, sir!

[23-Jun-18 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, plz give it a try. i pushed it into dev branch as it has been doing swaps just fine
