@aFastHero  HyperDEX has this nice feature for debugging, if you click "view" on the swap, and then at the bottom "Copy swap debug data", you can past it here, so we can analyze it more in deep.

[16-Jun-18 11:14 PM] aFastHero#2811
Alright. I'll do that now.

[16-Jun-18 11:18 PM] aFastHero#2811
it is quite long

[16-Jun-18 11:18 PM] aFastHero#2811
cant paste it all in this window

I have a few things to take care of. I will check back in an hour. Do you believe you will be needing any info from me between now and then?

[16-Jun-18 11:24 PM] aFastHero#2811
nvm, I will take my iPad in to the shop with me.

[16-Jun-18 11:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Did you see these numbers in the filename of the .finished files that you deleted?:
```
            "requestid": 491551125,
            "quoteid": 1300658118,

```

[16-Jun-18 11:25 PM] aFastHero#2811
I will check now.

[16-Jun-18 11:26 PM] aFastHero#2811
"requestid":1029909388,
"quoteid":461716101,

[16-Jun-18 11:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
then it is not related.

[16-Jun-18 11:28 PM] aFastHero#2811
based on timestamps of file creation, there were no .finished files associated with the swap in question.

[16-Jun-18 11:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
on what directory?

[16-Jun-18 11:28 PM] aFastHero#2811
SWAPS directory for HyperDEX

[16-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
what is the path to it on windows?

[16-Jun-18 11:33 PM] aFastHero#2811

[16-Jun-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Do you have any completed swaps in hyperdex? Can you look in the debug info for a completed swap for the requestid and quoteid and see if there are files for it in that directory?

[16-Jun-18 11:49 PM] aFastHero#2811
I will check now

[16-Jun-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Are you using hyperdex nightly or hyperdex? Can you give the link you downloaded it from?

[16-Jun-18 11:50 PM] aFastHero#2811
HyperDEX

[16-Jun-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> They both say the same in the title, but I believe they store swaps in different directories for testing purposes

[16-Jun-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Ahh, that's not the nightly build, nevermind

[16-Jun-18 11:58 PM] aFastHero#2811
I found the file, in the aforementioned directory, that shares a requestid and quoteid found within the debug data of the one and only successful swap in HyperDEX.

[17-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
but that's not relevant, right? we need files related to the stuck swap.

[17-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> I was wondering if he was in the correct directory

[17-Jun-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763

I guess its safe to assume that this is somewhat of a doozie?

[17-Jun-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> No if you have the swap files, it's totally recoverable. Just for some reason Hyperdex is not doing it. If you are familiar with using CLI tools, I can walk you through how to claim it with the marketmaker CLI.

[17-Jun-18 01:35 AM] aFastHero#2811
I still need to compile all the files to run CLI

[17-Jun-18 01:36 AM] aFastHero#2811
can you send me the link to the CLI guide?

I am not able to find the guide for marketmaker CLI on windows.

[17-Jun-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Sorry, I'm not sure I'll be able to help. I have 0 experience using the marketmaker on windows.

[17-Jun-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> You could install barterdex, take the hyperdex SWAPS directory, put it in %appdata%\BarterDEX\DB , start barterdex, sign in with the same seed, go to trade history, click the stuck swap, click "kickstart stagnant trade" then restart barterdex

[17-Jun-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Should claim the stuck KMD

[17-Jun-18 04:37 AM] aFastHero#2811
Understood. I will get on that.

[17-Jun-18 04:38 AM] aFastHero#2811
I guess it would be worth my time to set up an old laptop with Linux to run the CLI?

[17-Jun-18 05:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can  get access directly to mm methods from the JS console

[17-Jun-18 05:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's a bit easier than using the CLI

[17-Jun-18 05:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
and it'll automatically use the correct port/userpass

[17-Jun-18 05:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
Open the devtools and run:

```
_api.debug({method: 'swapstatus', requestid: 174600499, quoteid: 4137389265})
```

in the console

[17-Jun-18 05:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
obviously change the params to whatever you want

[17-Jun-18 05:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
give it a few seconds and it will dump the response in the console

[17-Jun-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can do any mm command this way

I still have this same issue. I have btc stuck in the same manner. I tried moving my SWAP details into a working version of Barterdex and Barterdex isn't picking up on the stuck swap.

[17-Jun-18 04:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
hi guys, I was thinking if that would make any sense if Hyperdex would have 2 tabs 1 with atomic swaps exchange 2nd with proxy token exchange ?

[17-Jun-18 04:46 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Maybe it sound stupid, but from user experience (easy of use) proxy token is some way easier and faster right? more similar to CEX ?

[17-Jun-18 04:46 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
in that case the same app having these 2 options coul attract more users ?

[17-Jun-18 04:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
especially when small traders want to trade small amounts, atomic security is maybe not as important as easy of use and speed ?

[17-Jun-18 05:42 PM] aFastHero#2811
@SHossain My friend, you are the man! That worked immediately. Thank you so much for the guide, I will be saving it!

[17-Jun-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> @lukechilds if the current version doesn't do it already, and if it's needed (as i believe it's needed) i would suggest that HyperDEX implements a function (not necessarily exposed on the GUI) that not only issues the swapstatus method, but also deletes the affected .finished files.

[17-Jun-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> maybe the "kickstart" method already does that?

[17-Jun-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I withdraw some crypto, then I realized that i had no way to see the transaction id.

[17-Jun-18 07:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would be nice having some wallet functionality besides the swap/exchange stuff.

[17-Jun-18 07:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basic wallet functionality i mean.

[17-Jun-18 07:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like transaction history (like some CEX's have).

[17-Jun-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> That will come later in the year. Hyper will have agama functionality

[17-Jun-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> We are looking into this

[17-Jun-18 11:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
what do you mean with "Agama functionality"?

[17-Jun-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Basically another tab in hyper that does everything that agama does

[17-Jun-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> So full wallet functionality

[17-Jun-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Or maybe we incorporate it into the wallet section

[17-Jun-18 11:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh, got it: emulating Agama's functionalities.

[17-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not using Agama's software, more like replicating it.

[17-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
making something similar.

[17-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Basically building the wallet functions within hyper

[17-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cool.

[17-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Once we have that we can do fun things like check bobs utxos

[17-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
sounds like a challenge

[17-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Have a list of them and setup trades based on that info

[17-Jun-18 11:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope it works, it would be super. Or even hyper.

[17-Jun-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Haha we will see. When I get on discord remind me to shoot you a tip for helping out with support

[18-Jun-18 01:43 AM] vrcninja#5651
Just to close the loop @SHossain  I tried again and the suggestion you gave worked. My swap is no longer stuck and my payment was returned.

Yep, I'll be working on that this week

[18-Jun-18 10:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would be great to have the option to switch the pairs you are trading like in barterdex

[18-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For example when you have BTC on the left and KMD on the right, you see the price in kmd for a bitcoin 3457 kmd

[18-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And if you have a button to switch the pairs it would be nice

[18-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So you have the conversion to 0,00029

[slack] <acura360> if i place an sell order, i wait ca 30-60seconds... after that i get an "unmatched" and i don¬¥t see my Sell order in the Sell Orders Tab .. :thinking_face:

[18-Jun-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon I wouldn't recommend flipping the pair, choose the pair you want to use and then place buys and sells

[18-Jun-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
a BTC/KMD sell is the same as a KMD/BTC buy

[18-Jun-18 12:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
but if you want to flip them, you only need to change one currency on the drop down, if it's the same as the other side it'll flip

[18-Jun-18 12:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
e.g if you're on KMD/BTC:
- Change the base currency from KMD to BTC
- The quote currency (BTC) will automatically swap to KMD
