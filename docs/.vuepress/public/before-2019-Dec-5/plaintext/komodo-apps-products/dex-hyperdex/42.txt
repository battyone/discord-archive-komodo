[07-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Oszy#5734
To start use this with your actual details filled out
`mm2.exe "{\"gui\":\"MM2GUI\",\"netid\":9999, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"YOUR_SEED_HERE(same as you used in hyperdex)\", \"rpc_password\":\"ANY_PASSWORD_HERE\"}" &`

[07-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Oszy#5734

@TonyL @Sir Seven can we help this gentlement? I thought if we use latest mm2 binary we could cURL the fund recovery trough that, I tried on my end but the binary can't access any swap history from hyperDEX, and comes up with " swap not found"

[07-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@Oszy send me json you are trying to use as history.

[07-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Oszy#5734
I don't have json maybe thats the main issue üòÑ

[07-Nov-19 01:50 PM] Oszy#5734
Not sure if hyperdex keeps it anywhere after exit

[07-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Sir Seven#7158
MM2 will not know about any swaps until you transfer swap history from json file.

[07-Nov-19 01:55 PM] Oszy#5734
Sir, we only have uid

[07-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Oszy#5734
wait @vichiet say he has it

[07-Nov-19 01:56 PM] Oszy#5734

[08-Nov-19 12:27 AM] vichiet#4058

[24-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Elmis#0347
I'm speaking with some others i support but the solution is not so clear, the problem is:   when I conect my  ledger, open the Ledger KMD Reward Claim and click on Check Rewards to beguin the process and after the firs time I press on export public key, I get a red label error: Error
Bitcoin JSON-RPC: Request Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8232

[24-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Elmis#0347
What can I do?

[25-Nov-19 07:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Elmis i think the server is out of sync. I have reached out to the dev to kick it.

[26-Nov-19 08:47 AM] gcharang#6833

[26-Nov-19 11:34 PM] Elmis#0347
@hyperDEX, the problem I have since I updated the firmware of Ledger 1.6.0.     I can enter my ledger wallet but when I claim the reward I get a REJECT in ledger and Error: Ledger device is unavailable!  in the api

[27-Nov-19 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@Elmis there are some issues with browser access to ledger after the latest firmware update

[28-Nov-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734

hyperdex and chainswap merging efforts?

[28-Nov-19 03:27 PM] jorian#4555
not really, we just thought it would be better to invest time in the better available solution (HyperDEX is :shexy: ) and morph Chainswap to more cc-gateway and cc-peg related solutions

[28-Nov-19 04:33 PM] Lennart#9331
judging from the outside... that sounds really good

[29-Nov-19 07:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
TBH i have had issues with time in the last few months. Jorian has been a great help with the project!

[29-Nov-19 07:06 PM] marktyler#0324
Can someone explain the dex "coin" on atomicdex or provide a link to a website that explains it.

[29-Nov-19 07:35 PM] Oszy#5734
scroll up literally a half screen

[30-Nov-19 12:13 PM] marktyler#0324
Where can you buy/trade "DEX" other than the atomic dex app

[30-Nov-19 12:31 PM] Acura#2748
OTC Deals

[30-Nov-19 07:51 PM] hastrup#8742
@marktyler like Acura said the only place to buy dex is with otc deal and whit dex api also called mm2= market maker 2 atomicdex hyperdex and chainswap use the same order books so it does not matter witch one you use.
