oh yea this would work

[11-Jul-18 03:50 AM] Regnar#6164
but I think the concept is actually pretty important for an atomic swap powered DEX. Like how I didn't think of it before, liquidity can be huge, but only if people are actively on it, and people who are only on it to trade won't be on it for long, or long enough to find buyers/sellers. So, add a feature that gets people to stay on it longer (for fun, company, or to find traders)

@hyperDEX It's fixed but not merged, we might have to wait until we've got the crowdin translations sorted first so it doesn't break anything

@sindresorhus @kevva can we merge this without messing up translations on Crowdin?

Hello, who do I need to talk to regarding listing on the dex?

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@leecrypto for which coin? Shoot me a dm

[11-Jul-18 01:10 PM] hardcoree#7374
hello

[11-Jul-18 01:11 PM] hardcoree#7374
does the barter/hyperdex store all the different coins in one wallet?

[11-Jul-18 01:11 PM] hardcoree#7374
like how bread and exodus support several coins with  1 private key?

[11-Jul-18 01:23 PM] PTYX#6840
With hyperDex you have one seed for all addresses

[11-Jul-18 01:23 PM] PTYX#6840
And yes it acts as a multi wallet

[12-Jul-18 02:57 AM] GoldmanSocks#8569
So do you need servers/vps that can keep hyperdex active/open 24/7 ? If so I can help.

[12-Jul-18 03:01 AM] PTYX#6840
Do you mean as liquidity providers?

[12-Jul-18 03:02 AM] GoldmanSocks#8569
as whatever I have some room on datacenter vmware servers.

[12-Jul-18 03:07 AM] GoldmanSocks#8569
I also run a mining pool on it tho.

[12-Jul-18 03:09 AM] GoldmanSocks#8569
64 cores 256gb ram with direct fiber connections.

[12-Jul-18 04:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Regnar Me for the moment but will be looking for people to help with that.

@GoldmanSocks The app is run locally but if you want to be a LP that would certainly help

[12-Jul-18 05:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
@GoldmanSocks or run Electrum servers

[12-Jul-18 07:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
hehe that is what i was thinking, but best to leave that out for now till we get to a point where we can make that process easier than what it currently is

Spoiler, Didn't even MENTION BarterDEX.

[12-Jul-18 09:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Of course not üòÉ

[12-Jul-18 09:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone should write an article about doing good research and why that is important.

[14-Jul-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hi guys, would it be possible to push for a new hyperdex release to get glxt added?

[14-Jul-18 03:20 PM] sindresorhus#8187
I‚Äôm doing another alpha release on Monday.

[14-Jul-18 03:30 PM] ad1981#7176
is this the place for BarterDEX support? And if so, would any one know why the DEX is unable not to recognize MUE, UIS, BATA and CRW when the wallets are fully synced on same machine running the DEX program? Thnks alot

[14-Jul-18 03:32 PM] ad1981#7176
for BATA the DEX exchange states "coin disabled" and does not respond well to enable native or electrum

[15-Jul-18 12:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@ad1981 That is strange there is no barterDEX channel. This channel is for hyperDEX support

[15-Jul-18 03:08 PM] ad1981#7176
okay thanks

[15-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Evitor#6985
Is it possible to run hyperDEX on a raspberry pi3?

[15-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Evitor#6985
Would be nice, if you want to sell something üòâ

[15-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
#dev-tradebots is for barterdex support @ad1981

[16-Jul-18 01:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Evitor I dont think so at this stage. PCs are very cheap these days, probably can grab one for $100 that you can leave on 24/7. But this is a problem that needs to be solved üòÉ

[16-Jul-18 01:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No one turns off their phones, so maybe there is some magic jl777 and Luke can do to make the mobile app workable üòÑ

[16-Jul-18 02:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@lukechilds What do you think about this?

[16-Jul-18 05:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
It should run on a Raspberry Pi fine in terms of resources, however I'm not sure if `marketmaker` will compile on ARM, I haven't tried that

[16-Jul-18 05:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
Mobile app is definitely possible but I don't think it would be a replacement for a 24/7 box, it would absolutely kill the battery if it was always running in the background and would likely never get approved on the iOS app store

[16-Jul-18 05:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
An alternative would be to work on a fully featured API for `marketmaker` v2 which could run 24/7 on a cheap VPS and then the mobile/desktop client would connect directly to that as a thin client

[16-Jul-18 06:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm sure `marketmaker` will compile on Raspberry Pi fine.

[16-Jul-18 06:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Any GUI has to just replace the marketmaker in the app and it should work.

[16-Jul-18 06:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
best is to try the command line tools to run the app on Raspberry pi instead of expecting a prebuilt.

[16-Jul-18 06:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BarterDEX GUI should work in that way.

[16-Jul-18 06:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But since the Raspberry Pi is still a low resources machine, using it for DEX may or may not be as optimal on Desktop machines.

[16-Jul-18 06:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
should still be fine for using short time and tests.

[16-Jul-18 08:02 PM] Jonathan#3687
Not sure how relevant it is or if the scenario would even come up but while having HDEX open when I open the GLX dICO app it crashes marketmaker and relaunches HDEX. Reproduced it quite a few times

[16-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Hermes#6934
I think they are using the same Marketmaker that can provoke that

[16-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Hermes#6934
they are the same process in some way

[16-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Jonathan#3687
Weird though when HDEX relaunches everything is ok

[17-Jul-18 02:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
mm should be the same, unless the bundled mm is a different version than the one hyper is using?

[17-Jul-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant run two marketmakers on the same computer. So its expected that the two apps cant run at once.

[17-Jul-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To do that in PIZZA/BEER stress test, I had to make 9 Virtual Machines to separate them all out.

[17-Jul-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And even then, each marketmaker had to be on a different netid... As you cant have 2 marketmakers using the same public IP on the same net id.

[17-Jul-18 02:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont forget it is 1 mm per wan IP also.....not just computer

[17-Jul-18 02:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is something we hope is fixed in mm 2.0

[17-Jul-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. Unless you are using multiple NetID's then you can run more than one... Thats only a nanomsg limitation as far as I am aware. Moving away from nanomsg is probably required for MM2.0. IMO.

[17-Jul-18 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont know if you can get away from nanomsg, seems to be ingrained ....

[17-Jul-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There has to exist better suited network stacks that can be used, I guess james used nanomsg because its C code and he had experience with it from iguana.

[17-Jul-18 02:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes and it worked

üíØ 

[17-Jul-18 02:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it is not a viable solution to the DEX

[17-Jul-18 02:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
well if we want to scale

[17-Jul-18 02:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
mm 2.0 will be using rust which should be much better in terms of memory handling, so i have high hopes that we can make something decent

If possible Web-RTC would be a great protocol to build mmv2 on

[17-Jul-18 07:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's P2P and will allow native web clients to be built in the future

[17-Jul-18 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would be good

New HyperDEX alpha release is out:
