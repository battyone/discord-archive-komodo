Thanks. I will try a bit

[30-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I think hyperdex has an auto utxo splitter?

[30-Jul-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for reliability its best to have a "trading" address with a spread of UTXO's then trades just always work. thats how I have always done it for a long time, and rarely have faliures.

[30-Jul-18 12:14 PM] 7rank#9952
@blackjok3r can you elaborate?  How did you set up the spread that works most of the time?

[30-Jul-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just have lots of them. I always yuse the same address then sent a heap of 10 KMD to it... over time the transactions cause change UTXO's to fill up the wallet... occasionally they get a bit small, sou you need to withdraw some KMD back to your own address to consolidate some of them. This way there is always lots of dust UTXO to use for the Alice Dex fee aswell. No nede to worry about splitting UTXO's and all that stuff.

[30-Jul-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BarterDEX has the UTXO inventory, which is good to use to split one deposit in one transaction to save on transaction fees and time.

[30-Jul-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Once you have it set up, it works for quite some time.

[30-Jul-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not like I buy 100's of KMD volume of anything though.

[30-Jul-18 12:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can also use barterdex inventory maker

[30-Jul-18 12:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Login on barter, make inventory, login on hyper with the same address to do the trades

ðŸ¥‰ 

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
send you KMD to trading address, make inventory... 10-50 UTXO 10-20 KMD in size and a few 0.1 to start with is pretty good.

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you should get matched on any trade that way, proveded the bob is working.

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Another thing I notice with Hyper, ALWAYS increase the price it chooses by 5%.

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or at least 2%

[30-Jul-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it gets `unmatched` a LOT on smaller amounts.

[30-Jul-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most of the time, on the bob console it was refusing a trade with HyperDEX buys, by margins of less than 0.001c

[30-Jul-18 12:22 PM] 7rank#9952
@Cryptoon @blackjok3r thanks for your input, guys.  I'll try this from now on.  For some reason I though hyperDEX removed the utxo hurdle from users.  However, after many unmatched trades it would explain why I'm having issues.

[30-Jul-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It does not `join` UTXO together... it can only trade up to the larges UTXO you have, and doesnt really tell you this.

[30-Jul-18 12:23 PM] 7rank#9952
@Cryptoon for larger trades, do you recommend the 2 transactions funding approach?

[30-Jul-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unmatched doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong either... I was trying to buy GAME earlier, 2nd trade for 3 GAME was matched,  but only bought 0.9 adn then after than couldnt get a single trade through.

[30-Jul-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Most bobs dont have large UTXO's for sale. so buy/sellign large amounts you usually need to do heaps of smaller trades.

[30-Jul-18 12:45 PM] 7rank#9952
@blackjok3r I understand. Thx

[30-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When I get a hit, I try the same amounts, if it's unmatched, it usually means the UTXO's of the sellers aren't matching yours so you can try different size orders/utxo's

[31-Jul-18 12:25 AM] c2k#4915
i was on hyperdex yesterday but when i try to log on now i get 2 messages...
1) HyperDEX will now relaunch

[31-Jul-18 12:28 AM] c2k#4915

Are you trying to open it with barterdex already open? Seems like possibly the marletmaker is crashing or not starting.

[31-Jul-18 01:29 AM] c2k#4915
no bdex was closed. plus i checked task manager to make sure and there were no instances

[31-Jul-18 01:29 AM] c2k#4915
of mm

[31-Jul-18 03:58 AM] Hermes#6934
Any type of firewall or program that could be blocking hyperdex? I have seen this when the connection is bad on my end

[31-Jul-18 04:42 AM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
So there is no way to cancel?

[31-Jul-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what do you mean... HyperDEX trades time out after 60s unless they match and complete

[31-Jul-18 01:05 PM] c2k#4915
fwiw, i uninstalled and reinstalled. whatever the issue was went away and im now able to log in

[31-Jul-18 04:55 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
My wallet shows my balance - my hyperdex balance. Hyperdex shows my swaps and "no match". It also shows "18 assets" my hyperdex deposit wallet shows 0.

[31-Jul-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
HyperDEX has a bunch of coins activated by default. I am not 100% sure how you remove an unmatched swap. Unmatched means it did not match and timed out. The DEX can only make trades while you are online, if you ave gone offline, (closed the app for any reason) that trade is dead.

[31-Jul-18 05:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it was unmatched it never found a seller and nothing happened.

[31-Jul-18 05:03 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Ok

[31-Jul-18 05:04 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
How do i withdraw my deposits

[31-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Jonathan#3687
In the Dashboard view, select the coin you want - the withdraw and deposit buttons are there

[31-Jul-18 05:05 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Jfc

[31-Jul-18 05:06 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I know that. My balance is zero because my coins are locked up in swaps

[31-Jul-18 05:06 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Swap isnt "auto cancelling" like everyone says

[31-Jul-18 05:06 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I feel like i'm going round and round with this chat

[31-Jul-18 05:06 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590

@Decker plz help

[31-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
decker isnt hyperdex specialist

[31-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@lukechilds and @sindresorhus are hyper devs

[31-Jul-18 05:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
@NWhiskeyTango what's the issue?

[31-Jul-18 05:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
sorry, I know you said you've been going round and round

[31-Jul-18 05:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
but I'm not up to speed

[31-Jul-18 05:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can see the balance in HyperDEX?

[31-Jul-18 05:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
or you can't?

[31-Jul-18 05:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, if it is EQL there were some issues with spv which might be at the origin of all this

[31-Jul-18 06:25 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Ty  @lukechilds at work now. When i get home i am going to try a couple other suggestions. If not i will send some screenshots this way. Sorry i didn't mean to sound like a DH earlier every1. Bee a long week

[31-Jul-18 06:26 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Thanks for all the help too btw

[31-Jul-18 06:26 PM] lukechilds#2707

[31-Jul-18 06:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
I might be asleep when you're back from work

[31-Jul-18 06:26 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
All good

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
could be an issue with the underlying `marketmaker` daemon locking up your UTXOs which is out of the control of HyperDEX (we just build the GUI)

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
you could try downloading HyperDEX Nightly

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
import your seed into that

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
then withdraw your funds

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
they are totally isolated instances

[31-Jul-18 06:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
won't fix the bug, but will enable you to withdraw your funds

[31-Jul-18 06:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
you should avoid running both HyperDEX and HyperDEX Nightly at the same time too

New HyperDEX alpha version is out: ERC20 support and the ability to export your trade history to CSV (for Excel).
https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases/latest

Important: If you have used any previous beta version, you need to delete your trade history as this version has an incompatible format. Right after opening this version, go to the "Debug" menu and choose "Delete Trade History".

The update fixed it ty

[01-Aug-18 03:00 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Is there no "good until cancelled" option?

[01-Aug-18 03:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
not yet, but we will be looking at adding thar soon

[01-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi guys just for the record on the Windows version I receive a message after the download like stating that this is not a regular program and it shows an option to discard the download

[01-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Hermes#6934
after the download ends

[01-Aug-18 03:31 PM] Hermes#6934
user has to select to keep the download

[01-Aug-18 03:54 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I got that too. Something like "this is not a regularly downloaded file"

[01-Aug-18 04:05 PM] monokh#4656

@ciumete restart and try again

[01-Aug-18 06:29 PM] SHossain#0007
that should help

[01-Aug-18 06:49 PM] ciumete#3212
i restart the hyperdex, no more errrors receive. but the swap status is still at 3/5 and  the btc amount is short (same in blockchain explorer)

does the beer faucet work? waiting for some beer but it doesn't look like it's coming through

[02-Aug-18 01:31 AM] kremer#4440
nevermind, no markets on hyperdex to test with anyways

[02-Aug-18 01:31 AM] kremer#4440
the GUI looks very nice

[02-Aug-18 02:10 AM] kremer#4440
found some chips to test with - can't get a match in 5 tries

[02-Aug-18 02:14 AM] cipi#4502
can't see any CHIPS requests... means your node didn't sent the request to the network... so you either don't have proper UTXOs for the coin you used to buy CHIPS or marketmaker does not have proper connection to the network.... the console output of marketmaker will tell you what is wrong

[02-Aug-18 02:19 AM] kremer#4440
i have a few utxos for chips and tried varying size sells. got -9999 error if that helps

[02-Aug-18 02:20 AM] cipi#4502
-9999 is a GUI error code, don't know what it means, i am only a CLI guy ðŸ˜ƒ

[02-Aug-18 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Unmatched i think

[02-Aug-18 02:23 AM] kremer#4440
that's what a channel search says - unmatched

[02-Aug-18 02:25 AM] cipi#4502
strange is that i didn't saw a request for CHIPS...

[02-Aug-18 02:26 AM] kremer#4440
it was small amounts, 0.1 up to 1 and a few in between

[02-Aug-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have noticed that about 5% of trades I have tried never propagate to the network. Not sure what causes it.
