[30-May-19 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007

[30-May-19 07:58 PM] 24052019#7280

[30-May-19 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
`yeah i think,` ?

[30-May-19 07:59 PM] 24052019#7280
i dont know if anyhtings meant to happen so was unsure

[30-May-19 08:00 PM] SHossain#0007
that comamnd mean to close the file by saving it

[30-May-19 08:01 PM] 24052019#7280
i have box open with GNU Nano 2.0.6

[30-May-19 08:01 PM] 24052019#7280
top left

[30-May-19 08:01 PM] SHossain#0007
that means you couldn't save it

[30-May-19 08:01 PM] 24052019#7280
with ./komodo-qt-mac -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 & pasted in it

[30-May-19 08:02 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't know how to do that, just close the terminal you were using to create the shortcut, use the other way how you started next time. just save the steps in a notepad

[30-May-19 08:04 PM] 24052019#7280
okay. sorry for wasting your time man

[30-May-19 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
how's your PIRATE wallet doing?

[30-May-19 08:17 PM] 24052019#7280
dont know, just following the steps again

[30-May-19 08:19 PM] 24052019#7280
./komodo-qt-mac -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 & saying no such file or directary

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
that means you are not in the right directory

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
it was there

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] 24052019#7280
im in MacBook-Pro:komodo-qt-mac-2 XXX$

[30-May-19 08:20 PM] SHossain#0007
type `ls` and see if you the `komodo-qt-mac` file is there or not

[30-May-19 08:21 PM] 24052019#7280
MacBook-Pro:komodo-qt-mac-2 XXX$

[30-May-19 08:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't see the file, you are in a diffrent directory

[30-May-19 08:22 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to `cd` to the right directory and issue the start command

[30-May-19 08:23 PM] 24052019#7280
cd ~/Downloads/komodo-qt-mac-2    right?

[30-May-19 08:25 PM] SHossain#0007
should be

[30-May-19 08:25 PM] SHossain#0007
it's your computer

[30-May-19 08:25 PM] SHossain#0007
based on the outputs you provided me last time, it was there

[30-May-19 08:28 PM] 24052019#7280
yeah dont know why its showing up not there, nothing has changed

[30-May-19 08:28 PM] 24052019#7280
pirate.sh.save, PIRATE_7776, komodo.conf, fetch-params.sh

[30-May-19 08:28 PM] 24052019#7280
are in the folder now

[30-May-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
that means, you somehow deleted the `komodo-qt-mac` file

[30-May-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
delete the full folder and unzip again

[30-May-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
and try

[30-May-19 09:05 PM] 24052019#7280
sorted it.

[30-May-19 09:06 PM] 24052019#7280
My man Hossain; thanks for keeping your cool with a lemon like me

👍🏽 

[30-May-19 09:11 PM] 24052019#7280
since it says komodo wallet, im guessing ARRR can be used in the same wallet as KMD?

[30-May-19 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
the command i gave you is to start ARRR wallet

[30-May-19 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
if you wanted only KMD the start command would be `./komodo-qt-mac &`

[30-May-19 09:13 PM] 24052019#7280
oh right, i double clicked komodo qt mac in my folers

[30-May-19 09:13 PM] 24052019#7280
chmod +x pirate.sh?

[30-May-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
that was to create shortcut, so you wouldn't have to use the long command every time

[30-May-19 09:16 PM] 24052019#7280
./komodo-qt-mac -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 &

[30-May-19 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-May-19 09:27 PM] 24052019#7280
ran it and its opened up another kmd wallet

[30-May-19 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
you can run as many wallets with this file

[30-May-19 09:29 PM] SHossain#0007
same wallet you can run only one instance

[30-May-19 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe you are running KMD and PIRATE now?

[30-May-19 09:30 PM] 24052019#7280
i see, it has pirate instead of kmd, sorry i just took a quick glance at the top of the window

[30-May-19 09:30 PM] 24052019#7280
i am yes, sorry

[30-May-19 09:31 PM] 24052019#7280
And the seeds from these are transferbale to agama, once we have the updated agama out?

[30-May-19 09:32 PM] 24052019#7280
thank you hossain, not only did you help me making the wallet but actually taught me about terminals, appriciate it alot.

[30-May-19 09:33 PM] SHossain#0007
if you use native mode, it doesn't use seed, it uses wallet.dat which contains your addresses, their private key and related txs. if you close this wallet and start using Agama native mode for these coins, Agama will automatically pick up these wallet.dat

[30-May-19 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll be more happy if you can remember all these and learn more while using and help others in need

[30-May-19 09:37 PM] 24052019#7280
ive got the steps down on notepad, at the moment its just a process to me but im going to look up the meaning behind the commands and how it intergrates  together. Once ive grasped it if i see anyone with similar issues i’ll shout up.

Is there any VanityGen for kmd ? 🤔 
I want to find(create) custom wallet public address.

[01-Jun-19 11:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
@Mr. HashEm  github.com/DeckerSU/vanitygen-plus

[01-Jun-19 11:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe this here is for windows in case you are on win: github.com/DeckerSU/vanitygen

[01-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
Thanks

[01-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
It doesn't say KMD is supported

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
which one you use?

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
vanitygen-plus

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
?

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
yes

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
I think I must use BTCD address format

[01-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Mr. HashEm#3357
right ?

[01-Jun-19 11:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
that should work yes

[01-Jun-19 12:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
./vanitygen -C KMD -i -k RCHMEX

[01-Jun-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do yourself a favor and always run vanitygen with `-F compressed` 😉
