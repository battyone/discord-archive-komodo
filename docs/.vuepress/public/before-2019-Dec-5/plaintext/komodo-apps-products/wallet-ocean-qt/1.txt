small survey ... how do you think, how many people used our `komodo-qt` in everyday life? question related to upcoming changes since 1.000.000 block ... currently komodo-qt didn't have needed changes in sources for monthly interest claim support and few other things. we didn't see much interest from the community to this wallet. so, the main question is - should we continue to support it? if nobody uses it, should we continue to work on it?

[28-Jun-18 12:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless Agama is planed to eventually have advanced features, I think the qt wallet is highly necessary; however, I could just be biased because I use it daily

[28-Jun-18 12:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
As to the 2nd part, community interest could have to do with presentation. 99% of the time all people hear is Agama. Granted, it's a flagship product, but I don't think most people even know there is a qt wallet

never used it, but i think QT is underpromoted on KMD platform since Agama is the wallet to rule them all

[28-Jun-18 09:54 AM] jorian#4555
once on the KMD platform, chances are you want an asset or two, and that will want you to go to Agama

[28-Jun-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"since Agama is the wallet to rule them all"
Until Agama has any real coin features, I'll continue to not use it.
imo, Agama is the granny wallet and QT is the wallet for people that actually use currency.

[28-Jun-18 11:33 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie you are in the right channel üòõ

[28-Jun-18 12:08 PM] jorian#4555
well i can use a currency using Agama

[28-Jun-18 12:08 PM] jorian#4555
define use

[28-Jun-18 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe "use" is too strong of a word and I should have said "maintain personal control of"?
Unless I've just missed something, Agama lacks :
the ability to send multiple payments at once 
the ability to control fee expenses
any way to manage UTXOs manually
and
any way to even know what UTXOs you have.
Specifically, to the last bit, Agama is like cramming all of your money in your pocket, buying a coffee, and then shoving all of your money at the cashier and saying "here, you sort it out and give me back whatever change you decide I should have."

[28-Jun-18 12:29 PM] jorian#4555
good analogy, i think you're right. but it's the easy solution what most people want. If you buy a 23.49$ coffee and all you have are lots of quarters and dimes, then most people are lazy as fuck and rather shove it, yes.

[28-Jun-18 12:29 PM] jorian#4555
the cashier is a computer after all

[28-Jun-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, the flip side to that is:
If you want to spend 9 KMD and you have UTXOs of 10, 10, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 0.0001 then agama will bust up your reward 10 and leave you with 10,  3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0.9999, and 0.0001

[28-Jun-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because, bitcoin üò¶

[28-Jun-18 12:33 PM] jorian#4555
yeah, who cares. :troll:

[28-Jun-18 12:33 PM] jorian#4555
but anyways, you use QT, i think most of the advanced users use the CLI

[28-Jun-18 12:34 PM] jorian#4555
and in that way, Agama is really the granny solution

[28-Jun-18 12:34 PM] jorian#4555
and that's not bad

[28-Jun-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not saying Agama's not a good product or that it's not good for many folks; I'm just saying that I think QT has a place and there are a lot more folks like me out there (that perhaps haven't even come to Komodo yet)

[28-Jun-18 12:34 PM] jorian#4555
if you want more control, you need to do a little more

[28-Jun-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"but anyways, you use QT, i think most of the advanced users use the CLI"
tbh, I use QT on my win box only and cli on nix boxes

[28-Jun-18 02:26 PM] Decker#3767
What about me - i'm using QT on both platforms: WIndows and Ubuntu, it's very convenient ... and Coin Control Features are "unique". I can simply select an utxo from which i want to send coins. Agama doesn't allow this, and from cli - this is a problem too. Because no utxo field in `sendtoaddress` or other cli commands. In CLI i just can do `lockunspent` to prevent few utxos from being spended. But i can't select an utxo from which i wish to spend from CLI ... and this is not comfortable.

I like QT coin control

[28-Jun-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Seems you answered your own question there; yes, we need it üòõ

[28-Jun-18 02:27 PM] Decker#3767
But Qt have other problems ... if you have 20000 utxo with 0.0001 KMD in your wallet - GUI will hang for a couple of minutes to display it )

[28-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Decker#3767
That's why it's not recommended to use wallet.dat with very high number of utxos with Qt.

[28-Jun-18 02:29 PM] Decker#3767
Btw, today i invited @Ocean in this chat ...

[28-Jun-18 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The hang and lack of multi-select are negatives, but the hang is more inherent in the core than the GUI (I think)

[28-Jun-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
alternatively, don't mine 20k blocks before you consolidate üòõ

[01-Jul-18 04:44 PM] pbca26#5430
mos of the features you desire are not needed for regular users
if we loose one computergenie  to qt wallet and gain more average joes in agama i say that's a solid win
no one in sane mind is going to work through numbers to save on some dust fee amounts as well as messing with individual utxos
people wanted a somewhat grama friendly product so here you have it
i like qt wallets for their speed and advanced features for hardcore folks

[01-Jul-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Yes, @pbca26, because what sane person would want to send out 2+ payments at once rather than paying double tx fees ü§¶üèø

[01-Jul-18 04:46 PM] pbca26#5430
how many people need to send 2 or more payments?

[01-Jul-18 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
When a crypto is actually used as a currency: many

[01-Jul-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I get going for mass appeal; I don't get the notion of "fek real use cases we love Granny"

[01-Jul-18 04:49 PM] pbca26#5430
well most folks want grandma friendly
they don't need coinage control or mass payments
anyhow all these features are on my todo list but they come last on it

[01-Jul-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you were paying your monthly bills and had fees asigned to amount of payments, would you opt for paying extra fees and making extra payments or opt for less fees and only having to make 1 payment?

[01-Jul-18 04:50 PM] pbca26#5430
are you paying your monthly bills in kmd?

[01-Jul-18 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the hope is someday

[01-Jul-18 04:51 PM] pbca26#5430

[01-Jul-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if we're not in crypto to use is as a currency, then wtf are we doing

[01-Jul-18 04:51 PM] pbca26#5430
when the day finally comes i'll add it

[01-Jul-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
keep in mind that this fee argument is coming from a guy that makes his living off of fees üòâ

[01-Jul-18 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
professionally, I hope no one ever pays less fees
personally, I find limiting options to be limiting

[01-Jul-18 04:54 PM] pbca26#5430
for your own good :)
not w/o a reason

[01-Jul-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Limiting your options for your own good"
Didn't they try that in 1940s Germany?

[01-Jul-18 04:56 PM] pbca26#5430
lets not succumb into history/politics discussion
your consideration is noted

[01-Jul-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
That was more sarcasm than political, but my point is that while I can see keeping Agama as a flagship product, I think that making it the sole focus is a horrible idea
By extension, it's the same as abandoning BarterDEX and only promoting HyperDEX

[01-Jul-18 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If marketing is pushing Komodo as an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider", it's counter to that to say that apps with extended features are "insane"

[01-Jul-18 05:03 PM] pbca26#5430
all products deserve focus
but i'm not sure how agama is related to any pr
there's no pr and never was, random tweets and posts don't make it marketing

[01-Jul-18 05:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
scroll through the marketing channel (or most any of them) and count the team references to "Agama" and count the total references by everyone (not counting me) for "QT" or "Ocean"

[01-Jul-18 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
üéµ "...seems like they forgot about Dre...." üéµ

[01-Jul-18 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
In fact, if you read #komodo-team  from yesterday and don't get the sense that Audo is all about pr for Agama (where wallets are concerned), then I'll never speak of wallets again

[01-Jul-18 05:29 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't see why we can have the best of both worlds and have QT for the technically inclined and Agama as a user friendly wallet

[01-Jul-18 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that's what I'm saying

[01-Jul-18 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or even add an overlay for the raws to Agama and have it all in one
While I love the technical aspects of Ocean being 1 of only 2 equihash QT wallets, if Agama had actual currency features then this would be a different conversation

[01-Jul-18 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's hard to be an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" and cut out promotion of a given _x_ feature of tech

[01-Jul-18 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
And, while it's technically, grammatically true that "Agama doesn't get pr", it's 99.9999999% the only option offered or discussed and I'd literally bet some KMD that about the same percentage of users don't even know that Ocean exists

[01-Jul-18 05:45 PM] PTYX#6840
Does coin control work in spv?

[01-Jul-18 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
same as in native: raw transactions (like mm uses)

[01-Jul-18 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and to step into my condescending shoes for a moment:
Not counting electron, what tech is in Agama besides a webpage and a bit of ajax?

[01-Jul-18 07:08 PM] PTYX#6840
Your feature request is added to the wishlist. If it's so simple then make the changes and PR. If not, then we wait for the person who tackles the feature wishlist by priority.

[01-Jul-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"If it's so simple then make the changes and PR."
The flip side to that is:
"Why would I spend time coding a feature that already exists in a hugely over-looked, and under-promoted, app already?"

[01-Jul-18 07:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
combined with:
"If I didn't suck at graphic design, I likely would have done so long before the Ocean wallet existed"

[01-Jul-18 08:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I have to add in, there are tons of people that have experience with QT wallets, so it would be nice to have that experience available with KMD. I use Komodo-Ocean-QT on one machine, so I would like to see it continue if possible @Decker üòäüëè

I am delaying updating master for now. but beta will become master prior to height 1000000

[03-Jul-18 05:40 AM] Decker#3767
ohhh ... this will be too hard, i think, to import all current beta changes to komodo-qt ... `komodo-qt` and  `komodod` is **unmergable**, so, updating komodo-qt it not just `git merge` ... it's a hard work to analyze every (!) commit for compatability with komodo-qt. if you just merge `beta` komodod into `master` - i think we don't have time to import all changes. because currently, as i remember, don't contain anything about new assetchains keys and other things. also, as i remember, dev and beta branches have some changes in library usage ... it seems to me it will like a pain ...

[03-Jul-18 05:42 AM] Decker#3767
importing in komodo-qt current commits from master - is a one work, but if master will be merged with beta - it's a totally different and more harder work.

[03-Jul-18 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then make the version compatible with master for now. that should work for KMD, just wont work with the new CC enabled chains or chains using new ac options

[03-Jul-18 06:21 AM] Decker#3767
yes, this was initial plan ... make `komodo-qt` compatible with current master.

I've been writing with Fyookball to negotiate an electron Komodo wallet. They are now integrating ledger and I think it's worth pursuing a pure fork.

[03-Jul-18 04:38 PM] PTYX#6840
It would probably be easier to take the BTCP electrum wallet, fork it to Komodo and then apply the ledger changes to the wallet if it doesn't break anything.
