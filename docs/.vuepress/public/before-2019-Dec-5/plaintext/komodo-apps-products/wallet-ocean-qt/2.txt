some custom work would be needed, the benefit is freedom from crazy fees

[04-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Senda#7983
yes, i know

[04-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Decker#3767
@pbca26 I think easier to fork any existing SPV wallet and modify it for Komodo than integrate it into Komodo-Qt. Is there any SPV wallets for Bitcoin example, that integrated into Bitcoin Core client? I mean not separate SPV wallets, i mean SPV wallet that using Bitcoin Core codebase?

[04-Jul-18 01:09 PM] Decker#3767
p.s. Of course combining native and SPV wallet idea like it implemented in Agama is interesting . But at this moment we haven't such aim.

[04-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Senda#7983
I'm sorry, I wanted to write my messages in the marketing channel

[04-Jul-18 02:43 PM] pbca26#5430
if there's a library/source that is c based you can make your own implementation
this will be a one of a kind qt wallet
jl mentioned once that nxt pioneered hybrid wallet/mode approach

[04-Jul-18 02:47 PM] pbca26#5430
i guess you can borrow code from bdex

[04-Jul-18 03:51 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If we could integrate ledger access into agama/qt we could put that long talked about issue to rest with ledger nano s

[04-Jul-18 03:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Bch has it done so we can definitely somehow modify their implementation.

[04-Jul-18 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or people could accept that hardware wallets come with that downside and caveat emptor

[04-Jul-18 04:56 PM] pbca26#5430
it wont help as change is required inside ledger fw
if it was as easy as integrating ledger would've been done by now

[05-Jul-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BreadWallet has C/C++ library as I remember
If that helps with SPV

@pbca26 what requires a fw change?

[05-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Alright#0419
I'm fairly sure someone could fork the electrum desktop app and get ledger support working, rewards included as it supports raw txs.

[05-Jul-18 05:16 AM] PTYX#6840
Already working on it

[05-Jul-18 05:16 AM] PTYX#6840
The ledger part is harder but we will have a Zilla Electrum in the coming days and hence Komodo electrum we if we want it

[05-Jul-18 05:16 AM] PTYX#6840
I personally love electrum and want it as a standalone in addition to Agama

[05-Jul-18 08:21 AM] pbca26#5430
@Alright you can trace back pull requests to ledgerhq from other coins to get an idea
check out ark for example

[01-Aug-18 02:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Decker hey mate, can you please tell me how are you keeping the QT wallet updated with real time updates from blockchain data?

[01-Aug-18 02:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
_I haven't actually tried QT, but I assume it behaves exactly as Bitcoin QT wallet _

[01-Aug-18 02:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I know the core daemon has zmq, 
are you using that in QT wallet ?

[01-Aug-18 02:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want a way to have realtime update from the wallet, pushed to the front-end code.
so I see few possibilities using go as backend and react.js as front-end
- use zmq to get the update on new block/tx and when it sends this update trigger the RPC API calls
- or make a code to process the debug.log file, and use it's realtime updates to trigger events to the go which passes to the front-end react.js code.

[01-Aug-18 02:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
which way you suggest?

[01-Aug-18 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Decker @pbca26 @ca333

[01-Aug-18 02:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the reason is this time I don't want to use `interval` push/pull method to get updates from the wallet and then do action.
I want to follow the event driven method of development with next app I'm working

[01-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Decker#3767
@grewalsatinder don't clearly understand the meaning of the question. Komodo-Qt is not external GUI on komodod, it's Bitcoin Core Qt Interface + Komodo Daemon inside. So, it has updates from blockchain data same way as komodod. And GUI part is used for visualisation. It's not used ZMQ or any other interface to interact with "daemon", it has "daemon inside". So, Komodo-Qt = closed integration of GUI and komodod, same as bitcoind and Bitcoin Core GUI.

[01-Aug-18 02:50 PM] Decker#3767
But i think for your purposes to get real-time updates from daemon in "external app" you can somehow use ZMQ or blocknotify ... but i never deep in how ZMQ works, so, can't advice anything concrete.

[01-Aug-18 03:17 PM] pbca26#5430
^ either that or watch debug.log/stdout
bitcoin has an option to output everything to a console, -printtoconsole

[01-Aug-18 04:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Decker okay, thanks for clearing.
@pbca26 in agama do you always do native `komodo-cli` command ? I tagged you as I thought you might be also doing something realtime in agama ü§î

[01-Aug-18 04:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for native wallets

[01-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Decker#3767
I think Agama calls uses RPC requests directly, without executing `komodo-cli` ...

[01-Aug-18 04:25 PM] ca333#0118
@grewalsatinder try `blocknotify` and see if its good for your purpose - its natively available and really easy to use.

[01-Aug-18 04:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ca333 right.... so with blocknotify whenever a new block will be synced to the local wallet, only then the set of API commands will be executed to check on getting updates, instead of doing every set interval api calls every seconds/minutes etc.

it *is* good, but much like `-reindex` it tends to get used/suggested more often than it should

@grewalsatinder  fyi https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/bitcoin-cli.cpp
using cli would be like using a proxy to make calls to coind rpc server
current agama implementation is old school, timers based
i'm going to convert it to event based in future
not sure when though

Hi there just in case , I get a syntax error if the Komodo folder doesn¬¥t have the .conf file. Users may encounter this error most likely if they are new

@jl777c read up 4 of satinder's messages - ```I want a way to have realtime update from the wallet, pushed to the front-end code.```
that annoying request i make at any opportunity of a blockchain event system, first was in Verus discord with mike about using an event system for their autochains, and more recently for CC state changes and how it will allow for real time UI updates and other oracle like services to be built (supply forecasting etc.).
can we emit to an endpoint?

[02-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Mylo#8306
it's just how app devs and front end devs think - on system changes and reacting to them

[02-Aug-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything happens on a block being received, just grab the relevant info with a blocknotify, blocknotify can be written in C or anything you want.

[02-Aug-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the native deamon will call the executable you specify on a block being received, check for condition

[02-Aug-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing happens if block isnt mined.

[02-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Mylo#8306
sending a tx to mempool happens before the block, and you don't want to be polling for mempool info - it's inefficient compared to an event system that would fire off a 'mempoolTxReceiveEvent'

[02-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Mylo#8306
apps won't be realtime waiting up to 60s for block.  can have a to-be-confirmed state and offer realtime-ness.

[02-Aug-18 09:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm... then we need to add mempool notify, but what if somebody spams the network?

[02-Aug-18 09:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
zmq covers the tx

[02-Aug-18 01:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
zmq is required when setting up the insight explorers. That must be how they can see pending transactions before they are confirmed in a block

[02-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Mylo#8306
nice, yeah that was the first time i saw the zmqxxxxxx settings in komodo.conf.
@grewalsatinder i didn't get much reading done, but it's all about patterns - communication patterns.  maybe have a look at some explorer code to see how it gets the pending tx like xRobeSx says.  thanks @xRobeSx

[02-Aug-18 08:57 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Was working a couple days ago, but now zilla wallet stuck, 0-connections, 5 days behind

[02-Aug-18 08:57 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Any ideas?

[02-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Hermes#6934
@NWhiskeyTango  I think you are talking about Agama , in which version you are having the issue? go to #deleted-channel

[02-Aug-18 09:31 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
#wallet-ocean-qt

[02-Aug-18 09:36 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I mean, wth. Must be used to shooing people away but ok.

[02-Aug-18 09:38 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Now what?

[02-Aug-18 09:39 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Using -addnode 54.39.23.248

[02-Aug-18 09:41 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
With 0 connections i assume that is the issue

[02-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Hermes#6934
I think that you misunderstood what I asked I haven't seen Zilla on the Komodo QT Wallet so I just pointed you to the Agama channel ... for us to help

[02-Aug-18 09:53 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think there is a Zilla QT wallet @Hermes based on komodo-ocean qt

[02-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Hermes#6934
hmmm a that's something new thanks good to know

[02-Aug-18 09:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not positive, but i think that's the case. I recall seeing it once if i'm not mistaken

[02-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Hermes#6934
And @NWhiskeyTango  have you asked PTYX ? He should know better he is the one managing Zilla

[02-Aug-18 09:59 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Yup

[02-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Hermes#6934
ok well if there is anything else we can help let us know

[02-Aug-18 10:01 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I feel like i'm probably going to be finding this fix on my own.

[02-Aug-18 10:01 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Based off that message it's affirmative

[02-Aug-18 10:02 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
For the record i asked him first then come here. Best of luck all

[02-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Hermes#6934
Just for my recommendation is that until an stable version of the Zilla QT wallet is released , try the Agama version for now

[02-Aug-18 10:10 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Ya agama works after the .41a release. Was just hoping i could get it stable. So much potential but so much instability with all the kmd products

[02-Aug-18 10:11 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
One day, it will all work from "download". I have faith

[02-Aug-18 10:12 PM] Hermes#6934
I am documenting the QT wallet right now is totally easier I think some users will decide in getting their Kmd only in the QT wallet and well Agama will remain for the majority of the users that want a multiwallet

[02-Aug-18 10:15 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Agree

[02-Aug-18 10:16 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
But at the same time is use the qt as a multiwallet. Can never have too many wallet options

[02-Aug-18 10:17 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@NWhiskeyTango I can give you a few of my ip's if you wanna try to start it with -addnode=

[02-Aug-18 10:17 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Here or pm?

[02-Aug-18 10:17 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
It's worth a shot

[02-Aug-18 10:18 PM] xRobeSx#5136
pm

[03-Aug-18 12:05 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Ty. Doesn't appear to have worked.

[03-Aug-18 08:35 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
