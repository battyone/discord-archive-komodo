ok thanks i'll try that

[10-Jun-19 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`and the veruscoin agama wallet creates a different address`
the same seed will create the same R address no matter what

[10-Jun-19 04:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@Decker any idea what causes this error?

[10-Jun-19 04:52 PM] ecbuddy#8524
no idea why this is happening, i changed the rpc user and pass, ran the batch file ect ect

[10-Jun-19 04:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@ecbuddy is there a komodo.conf file in the location: `%APPDATA%/Komodo` ?

[10-Jun-19 04:56 PM] ecbuddy#8524
no

[10-Jun-19 04:56 PM] ecbuddy#8524
I am installing on secondary hard drive

[10-Jun-19 04:56 PM] ecbuddy#8524
space blockchain is too large for my main drive

[10-Jun-19 04:59 PM] ecbuddy#8524
just pasted one in the folder adn the app opened up

[10-Jun-19 05:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@ecbuddy so is it working now?

[10-Jun-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
for "non-default", you need to add like
`datadir=/mnt/Storage/CoinData/Komodo/` (or path as per OS)
to komodo.conf and have a copy of the conf in the default location

[10-Jun-19 05:07 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@gcharang its working, but i can not DL the chain on this drive

[10-Jun-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
try what genie said

[10-Jun-19 05:08 PM] ecbuddy#8524
I add the path to the conf file?

[10-Jun-19 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes, just like any other conf param

[10-Jun-19 05:10 PM] gcharang#6833
theres a solution to add a shortcut in the article @ecbuddy that should work

[10-Jun-19 05:11 PM] gcharang#6833
one thing to note is that, if you remove and connect the external drive, it may get a different letter assigned in windows
so just change the setting at that time @ecbuddy

[10-Jun-19 05:13 PM] ecbuddy#8524
So, my path is

[10-Jun-19 05:13 PM] ecbuddy#8524
D/Wallets/Komodo/

[10-Jun-19 05:13 PM] ecbuddy#8524
in my conf I put this at the very bottom of it

[10-Jun-19 05:13 PM] ecbuddy#8524
datadir=D/Wallets/Komodo/

[10-Jun-19 05:14 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah but properly
like so:
`D:\...\...`

yes, win has slashes wrong way round:
`datadir=d:\Wallets\Komodo`

[10-Jun-19 05:17 PM] ecbuddy#8524
not working

[10-Jun-19 05:18 PM] gcharang#6833
@ecbuddy which solution did you try?

[10-Jun-19 05:19 PM] ecbuddy#8524
I moved the whole komodo directory to my D drive

[10-Jun-19 05:19 PM] ecbuddy#8524
i added the path to the conf file

[10-Jun-19 05:19 PM] ecbuddy#8524
i also moved kmd.exe into the same drive

[10-Jun-19 05:20 PM] gcharang#6833
you mean komodooceangui.exe ?

[10-Jun-19 05:20 PM] ecbuddy#8524
komodo-qt-win(1)

[10-Jun-19 05:21 PM] ecbuddy#8524
which houses the komodo-qt-win

[10-Jun-19 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`I moved the whole komodo directory to my D drive`
do you have a copy of the conf in 
%appdata%\komodo
?

[10-Jun-19 05:22 PM] ecbuddy#8524
no, I was told to move the whole directory as per the link above

[10-Jun-19 05:22 PM] gcharang#6833
so did you add the shortcut as the link said?

[10-Jun-19 05:22 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

Trying to run ocean wallet for the first time on Mac OS and getting "Error: Cannot parse configuration file:  Missing komodo.conf.  Only use key=value syntax".  Could someone please help?

[11-Jun-19 11:44 PM] richardt#2807
Using the latest version v2.0.15-rc2-g28-3

[12-Jun-19 05:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Before you start create the following configuration file, named komodo.conf in  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo folder:

rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=password
txindex=1
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241
addnode=144.76.94.38
addnode=89.248.166.91

[12-Jun-19 05:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Change rpc user and pass to something more secure

[12-Jun-19 11:20 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or just put the one provided in the download there

[12-Jun-19 08:33 PM] richardt#2807
Got it.  Thanks guys!

[14-Jun-19 06:24 PM] BadAss#8800
how do i claim interest with komodo-cli?

[14-Jun-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
send all funds to yourself

[14-Jun-19 06:25 PM] BadAss#8800
thanks!

[14-Jun-19 06:36 PM] BadAss#8800
is there a specific command for that? Like komodo-cli sendtoaddress address SENDALL?

[14-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
getbalance

[14-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
to know your balance

[14-Jun-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
sendtoaddress <addresss> balance - 0.0001

[14-Jun-19 06:39 PM] BadAss#8800
lol, yeah ok...was wondering which command agama was using in the background, but i guess it is more lines of code

[14-Jun-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
its basically that

[14-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Decker#3767 (pinned)
In komodo-qt we have "magic button", especially for claiming rewards )

How do I get my WIF from Ocean Qt so I can claim rewards in Verus Agama?  Is it "dump privkey" from the console?

@agnewpickens why would you want to? just send it to yourself in QT and be done with it
