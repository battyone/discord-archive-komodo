use `make clean` if you see errors, then, `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` again

@Notary-Operator **Important: Update Your Node Now**
Dear Notary Node operatos. Please update your node with saplig ready code for Komodo and Iguana, both from `dev` branch. We are about 12 hours away from network-wide Sapling activation. ZILLA and OOT are not activating sapling in their chain and we have added `-ac_sapling=5000000` in their chain params. Please performa a `git pull` with these updates. Stop ZILLA and OOT and start with new params. This is high priority. Please be sapling ready with your node ASAP. Thanks for you co-operation.

@Notary-Operator you need to update (restart) iguana after sapling activation, which happened right now. Without it you probably wont be notarizing assetchains. So it's mandatory.

There will be a mandatory VRSC update in the coming days, it would be best if everybody updates in time. more details as it becomes available, the tl:dr is that fpga algo is getting 75% of hashrate and it needs an updated fpga resistant algo (apparently it is possible)

new VRSC hardfork release is out. we need to update

[21-Dec-18 02:24 PM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator  hi guys! ere is summary of new update:

1. New version of VRSC came out. It's a hardforking change and very important that we have all notaries update it's version. I will be monitoring that everyone updated, so to help me do that - please - let me know (in DM!) that you updated or if for whatever reason you cant update. This means I expect all NN ops to msg me success or fail message :)
Update itself should not be a problem, just git pull and build.sh.

2. komodo/iguana now have  new assetchain KSB to honor @metaphilibert
I funded all nodes, you need only impportprivkey to that chain also. Nodes making first notarization of that chain will get special thank you. (THANK YOU :)

3. Please, monitor your notarizing funds in advance, not on the very last moment. If you need more - DM me. Dont go to #safespace searching for me or any other chat - just DM. You can also msg me in telegram ( @kolobus ) if something strange with discord. But not chats where it can be missed easily.

Cheers.

@Notary-Operator new fix for 4MB blocks problem pushed today. This means all notaries should again go updating all chains and report here if possible.
Please, switch to `beta` branch since now and update your nodes to current version of there which should be *0.3.3b*. Deadline for updating all nodes is 14 jan.
I know noone loves updating daily, but we should. Hopefully moving *all* noatries back to `beta` branch will allow to push there only important updates and combine them.
PS: Not updating in next 2 days means not only bad behavior, but also will fork your node making you not mine real KMDs.  Do not try that at home.

@Notary-Operator Ok. So noone do like in correct order - I will sum up everything into update. Lets do GINCOIN notarization now:

1. Install GIN coin by compiling from their repo or by using ready easy script, which went flawlessly for me:
 https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/456828345871761408/542321009307418634

2. You need to import GIN wif generated from your iguana seed. They have exactly same addresses as GAME, but WIFs are different.
In Decker's repo there is genkomodo.php - you need to edit it to add your iguana very secret passphrase, run it via PHP php genkomodo.php - it will print all WIFs including one for gincoin, and dont forget to remove secret passphrase after that.
Be careful if you're installing PHP first time. you need cli-only PHP, not the one which installs full webserver as a dependency!

'./gincoin-cli importprivkey WIF-from-above'

3. Tomorrow will be GIN coin airdropped to all notaries.

4. Iguana already have PR to start notarizing GIN, will be in beta tomorrow also.

5. All other steps are same as always.

Please, ask if you have issues doing above. Peace!

I will (temporaily) stop merging ANY pull requests for page content changes on 1st May in favor of "stable" promises for voters. They can always check page changes history, but this will be better.

After 14th May repo will be open to your fixes again and you will have to keep your page up to date during whole node life and afterlife (or till the end of time, whatever comes first).

@Notary-Operator here 
Hey, notaries, remember I promised bounties for those, who put their time in exchange to making Komodo great again? Here it comes.
I will not make any puzzles, quests or tricky questions (when polo?). I decided to just pick those, who actually made things better or worked hard. 
1. @Alright for making our days harder and putting our attention on election weak side. Much disliked but needed thing. 50000 VOTE.
2. @Decker for being *real* election master. Bc almost all election tech side is actually made by him, not by me. 50000 VOTE.
3. @blackjok3r - just scroll this chat up to see who actually spends best years of life here. 50000 VOTE
4. @SHossain is constantly helping dev process (he denies that, but thats true) all the time. 50000 VOTE
5. @MadMaX for komodod.com. It's awesome. 50000 VOTE
6. @CHMEX won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
7. @CrisF won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
8. @mrlynch as a pirate can get 1kk ARRR, but I only have VOTE's, so 50000 VOTE.
9. @Mylo - sometimes I underestimated much how hard marketing team and writers work also. Supported election public stuff. 50000 VOTE.
10. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 for being almost as cool as @Alright (joke). For activity in testnet and general participation. 50000 VOTE

Heroes above - please DM me your VOTE address (one and only). I will send batch when get all addresses.

And sorry to all others. I love you all and your donation to community is always valuable. But if we give VOTE's to everyone - there is no need for elections.

P.S.: Stop making long disattractive advertising nicks! Next time I did not find someone in discord hintbox - he misses the party :-p

@Notary-Operator please, have some attention on your assetchains funds. You should pm me for assetfunds in advance. Always keep 1000 or so inputs available. I’m here every day, but also sometimes sleep, eat or breed. I can’t send you funds instantly, it usually takes from 5 minutes to few hours or full day in some rare cases. That’s not my fault if you request funds only when 0 inputs left.

@Notary-Operator Dear NEW notaries! Welcome to the amazing world of Iguana TV! It's time to enter this world as a main characters. Please, send me in DM your two final pubkeys for the komodod and iguana.
One pubkey should be generated by iguana ("btcpubkey" field in iguana encryptwallet method output) as written in manual. It will be used for dpowing komodo to BTC and all assets into komodo. It's your main pubkey.
Second pubkey will be used for 3rd party coins notarizing. It should be generated same way as above, but with different passphrase.

You all know the safety rules, but I would like to remind:
1. Keep both passphrases (seeds) SAFE. It's main thing from which all your wallets, keys etc are generated deterministically. Knowing seed/passphrase means knowing all BTC, KMD and other privkeys.
2. Keep it really SAFE. Compromising your passphrase (as well as privkey) means your notary is done once and forever. We can't (100%!) revoke, recover, change or tweak pubkeys in komodod once they are hardforked in.
3. Make sure they are correct. As said above - we can't fix them or change later. It's blockchain. 

We already had notary ops lost everything because accidentally sending privkey to public chat or because evernote hacked. They just lost their spot and network got couple of dead servers.

Deadline is one week.

@Notary-Operator Dark things are happening! If you generated your pubkey (or even opened your seed just once!) in Agama wallet withting last 3 months - please, consider your seed (whole wallet) COMPROMISED. 
For new season notaries - if you did so - provide me new pubkey !ASAP!, which should be generated NOT in Agama and never opened in agama, I will update keys list before it's too late.
For old notaries - nothing you can actually do, but withdrawing all your mined funds very often and not keeping any amounts there.
In both cases - please report that to me in DM so I will know affected nodes. Dont feel ashamed, it's not your fault.
Others who used Agama - secure your funds!

[07-Jun-19 02:00 AM] kolo#1111
@Notary-Operator who did not submitted me new (generated after agama incident) pubkeys for the next season - please, do that ASAP. Just generate new set and DM them to me.
While we have second chance - I recommend everyone redoing set of keys to be safe. Regardless of using Agama. It's not hard.

Desired way of generating pubkey is using iguana itself, directly on the notary server where it will be used.

According to manual of setting up NN:
1. Put random passphrase in wp_7666 file, replace method with  `encryptwallet` (instead of `walletpassphrase`) 
2. Start iguana TV once, it will print you all coin WIFs (except couple of 3rd party coins)
3. Import that WIFs into their coin daemons
4. Replace back to `walletpassphrase`

Now you can write your passphrase on piece of paper using pencil, put that paper in a safe secure place and thats literally everything you need to restore your wallets anytime later.
Do NOT save your WIFs  in any  app or service. Do not type your passphrase or WIF *anywhere* at all. If passphrase was invented directly when editing wp_7666 file on your NN server ensures your passphrase wont be compromised anywhere outside.

You can use genkomodo.php (on same server!), but I don't see much reasons installing PHP just for that right now.

@Decker notice: I'm aware iguana won't print some coins WIF's, but this will be fixed. You should agree writing passphrase only once in a lifetime statistically more safe than additional script :-p

@Notary-Operator Hello my beloved NN team!

It's time to setup your season 3 servers (and update old ones sometimes).
 
1. New notaries. Your main server should be ready ASAP and will be notarizing:
KMD -> BTC, KMD assets (not forks!) -> KMD. Nothing else.

Install sequence is not different from old seasons:
Compiled Komodo, Bitcoin, Iguana.

Iguana should use `beta` (!) branch from `jl777/SuperNET` repo.

No other coins needed there.

[01-Jul-19 11:20 PM] kolo#1111
2. Old notaries.

Just continue working as you do now until very end (probably if possible till the end of July.

If you need to prepare for the new season on the same server - you can start setting up 3rd party as in the instruction, but please, don't kill old KMD/BTC setup until 15h July. And you should be using dev branch until then.

If you need time to switch over (send funds to new pubkey, rescan wallet or whatever) you can stop needed 3rd party coins, but please, try to keep KMD/BTC notarizing up.

3. 3rd party coins on new season NN

All other coins will be separated for the safety. There is a short manual by @blackjok3r on installing updated version of iguana for that. You will have to setup separate (!) server.

3rd party branch is: `git clone https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET.git -b blackjok3r`
Manual is here: https://pastebin.com/qD6zjTwX
(Please, notice iguana branch url is outdated there, use one from above)

Recommended specs are: not less than 16Gb RAM, 256Gb SSD, 8 threads min. On that server you will have Komodo, other version of iguana and all 3rd party coins. There should not be mining so it feels like specs will be ok (but I recommend having more disk space if possible, we can't predict what will be next coin).

This stuff is very experimental. Please, help @blackjok3r and others around you as much as you can. Time to implement this is very limited.

Also you CAN use different user on the same server as a temp solution while second server is in the process. Until the end of summer.
Than you will need to change port in secondary Komodo config into something different or use separate IP (if you know how, danger zone!).

Please, do not import secondary Komodo pubkeys/wifs into coins on primary Komodo and vice versa. It's your safety!

4. 3rd party coins on phasing out notaries: Do not touch them!)

Good luck. Please, ask any questions and don't get mad if not answered by me. Too many stuff in process and we totally lack time.

@Notary-Operator please, validate DEX chain on your nodes!
if you're stuck at 777930 (or near), do 
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX invalidateblock 04672a927367dd6372aeeabf815216f2ca02722d333a2b4ce28b588d43060bef`
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX reconsiderblock 007e3ef8eea980d8af1d4ecfe1ba60b760b1900eba763787d364bb3a032e2b24`
Should catch up real chain. 
Do nothing if it's already ok.
Ask for help in priv-nn.

@Notary-Operator hey guys. Much thanks for patiently NOT waiting for coin to be ready. Please, update komodod and iguana and import privkey to the new assetchains COMMOD. We are notarizing it already, please join the process. Notarizing funds are in your wallets.

It's important to restart all chains after update, not only KMD. Plz, make sure that you have restarted all notarized chains.

@Notary-Operator plz, check VRSC daemon status on your 3rd party notaries. If it's down, you should `git pull` fresh version from VerusCoin repo, recompile, restart daemon and iguana. Thx in advance.

@Notary-Operator update time! This time we need staged update with EU nodes updating first and others not updating yet.
Please, update your EU (!) nodes, switching to new official Komodo repo https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/tree/beta (beta branch!). Please report any possible issues.

@Notary-Operator please, update Komodo to 0.5.0 from the new main repo as announced by @ca333 earlier today. This time it's for all nodes, not only EU.
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/tree/beta
This is mandatory update, keeping on old repo from jl777 github account will result kitties blown up, earth destroyed and your node getting random dysfunctions.
