@Alright my connection is 1gbps.

Hi @SHossain 
Can you tell me how you are getting so many connections? Are they all outbound connections? Did you edit net.cpp? I have only 16-16-16-12. It seems like I have only outbound connection. The max of outbound is 16 but inbound can go as high as 125 so I guess I don't have inbound connection. My p2p ports are opened in my router forwarded to my server, UFW let those port pass too. fail2ban has all the NN ip to not trigger it. What else?

[02-Apr-19 11:01 AM] Strob#3417
My NN stopeed notarizing 2 hours ago. It seems I can just wait.... ☹

[02-Apr-19 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
open the ports, don't keep them binded to 127.0.0.1 and keep the daemon running for long without restart

[02-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Strob#3417
```don't keep them binded``` how?

[02-Apr-19 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
don't use `bind=127.0.0.1` or `rpcbind=127.0.0.1` in the conf

[02-Apr-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
SHoissain is some kind of special node... litterally every singel komodod tries to connect to his Alien servers for some reason... I have not been able to figure out why, apart from maybe they are the fastest and the protocol just chooses them

(if you used it)

[02-Apr-19 11:03 AM] jorian#4555
not sure about removing rpcbind

[02-Apr-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
the bind basically restricts other nodes to be connected to your node

[02-Apr-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r my EU node on mainnet (komodo) has only default 16 connections

[02-Apr-19 11:04 AM] Strob#3417
I don't have that in my conf

[02-Apr-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔  hmmm maybe someone else has a 37. node then 🤷

[02-Apr-19 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
oh....and i moved my testnet to a different server

[02-Apr-19 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
dedicated to dedicated

[02-Apr-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
58 connections on KMD is normal as long as the port is open properly

[02-Apr-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node ususally has about 90

[02-Apr-19 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[02-Apr-19 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
my AR node has 73 connections right now

[02-Apr-19 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
tbh...i don't think conn number does anything special

[02-Apr-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
more accepting connections are better for the network

[02-Apr-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
i have a separate dedicated server being used as seed

[02-Apr-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
all ports open and no funds

[02-Apr-19 11:09 AM] kolo#1111
@mrlynch we need that to make sure you have your node exactly at fork time/date. There can be no excuses for any reasons including mistakes, fires, hurricanes or data center delay

[02-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Strob#3417
Just discover in my router: Filter anonymous internet request set to on. I'll set it to off to see.

[02-Apr-19 11:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
@kolo that will not be an issue. it will be ready, locked & loaded

[02-Apr-19 11:15 AM] kolo#1111
Should I 100% trust everyone saying that?

[02-Apr-19 11:17 AM] kolo#1111
First year there were people learning how to use SSH after winning elections

[02-Apr-19 11:18 AM] kolo#1111
This is very strong recommendation so we won’t need to disqualify node for dumb 1 day dc delay

[02-Apr-19 11:18 AM] mrlynch#5735
of course you shouldn't

[02-Apr-19 11:19 AM] mrlynch#5735
so full node will be required for testnet as well?

[02-Apr-19 11:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
also, do you want us to put the election promises in the main github? i assumed we're not supposed to when you obsoleted the proposals folder

[02-Apr-19 11:27 AM] kolo#1111
@mrlynch I want all nodes to have both contact data / description and everything they want to say to voters and users in their github folder

[02-Apr-19 11:28 AM] kolo#1111
Actually I only made easy way to link node name into anything textual about that node. Up to nodes what they put there

[02-Apr-19 11:28 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok.. is it too late to add our promises on our page?

[02-Apr-19 11:29 AM] kolo#1111
Nope. Page can be and should be updated any time, and after elections also. That’s your node contact page, permanent

[02-Apr-19 11:30 AM] kolo#1111
Testnet is my recommendation

[02-Apr-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`tbh...i don't think conn number does anything special` it has been tested to be 100% a factor in counts.

[02-Apr-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not the largest factor.... but once all other optimizations are done on all nodes... this will give that extra little push

[02-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
does ok

[02-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

@mrlynch  Yes I know thankS! zero TXS since 10 hours. I checked everything: cleanwallettransactions, merge utxo (send to self), split 20 utxo, etc I can't see why

I created another TXSLCLL wallet on another server. I will send all my TXSLCLL to it but 0.0001 and then send back only 3 TXSLCLL instead of the 449 I have now and split them. we'll see if it helps.

[02-Apr-19 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the total value of coins doesn't matter
one UTXO of 10000000 coins is the exact same as one UTXO of 0.00000001

and yet nothing in stats...

[02-Apr-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you send out a tx with a time limit, if others sign it and there are enough of them, then it gets processed and becomes a notarization
not all attempts succeed

[02-Apr-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if time is past (expired), it gets ignored

[02-Apr-19 04:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
if your node managed to participate in a notarization, it will show up here, this is your address right ? http://txsclcc.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RKB54sZSUWEk6WVGN2Q7TBsjk7csd7Lm2z

[02-Apr-19 04:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
check your utxo, check your peers, check if your  TXSCLCC is fully synced

is your chain  synced ?, If yes then try to `cleanwallettransactions` and ,  enable `nosplit` if you haven't, then  manually reduce the number  of utxo to around 20
