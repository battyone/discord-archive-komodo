PIRATE is strong, REDFOX also, UTRUM also, we're all acting and going into the same directions

[20-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
and all people that join the boat, will make this happen

[20-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
not to the ecosystem

[20-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
to a platform spotlighting KMD and assetchains

[20-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
nope

[20-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
when govs will just unilaterally decide that if you can't backtrace funds to convert to FIAT, as long as you can't pay worldwide everywhere with crypto

KYC is necessary evil

[20-Jun-19 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
its not in an ideal world..

*censoring myself*

[20-Jun-19 02:22 PM] dan.#2473
the dream of no kyc will live on and cryptography makes it possible. but it wont ever be mainstream

[20-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s the point, mainstream

[20-Jun-19 04:11 PM] PTYX#6840
KYC is necessary or you go to jail as a business owner

[20-Jun-19 04:12 PM] PTYX#6840
if you run a non-kyc business, then you have to be prepared for the consequences.

[20-Jun-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
what countries dont have strict kyc rules?

[20-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
all i know is that end users atomic swapping cross chain is in the clear!

[20-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what else do we need?

[20-Jun-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
how can they do no kyc?

[20-Jun-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought fiat needed kyc

[20-Jun-19 10:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 you fill find that KMD internals are hardcoded to go into interest codepaths if the current coin is "KMD"

[20-Jun-19 10:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you need an abstraction layer

[20-Jun-19 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
or patch in your testchain ticker

[20-Jun-19 10:31 PM] phm87#7395
so if I want to have a testchain with interest, a real copy of KMD, what should I do ? Change genesis and ticker at few places ? Or just launch 2 KMD nodes without internet and without kmd blockchain and mine on it ?

[20-Jun-19 10:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@phm87 you could make a new chain and hack the code so it has ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL=0, then all the KMD code will kick in

[20-Jun-19 10:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
that would avoid changing hundreds of lines of code

[20-Jun-19 10:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User local.bitcoin.com is getting popular, many people migrated to it from localbitcoins

I had some issues to sync CHIPS too 4 weeks ago. Do some searches in #chips I think you'll find a solution

[21-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
we can provide direct access to nodes, , btw @Dr.Terminus addnodes won't bypass classic dnsseeds.
If you want to make sure, use -connect=X.X.X.X -> this will only connect to the target node

Hi 👋
There is a proposal aimed at streamlining NotaryNode Consensus reaching discussion and your thoughts and ideas would be appreciated.
http://pad.supernet.org/p/KMD_NN_Group_Consensus_Proposal
``` Problem
 
- circular discussion (infinite loop) 
- devolution into personalization of issues
- issues never satisfactorily finalized leading to carryover into later, unrelated issues
 
 
Goal
 
To develop a basic framework to facilitate Notary Node operators in reaching an informed `Group Consensus` that focuses on the issues involved, not the personalities of those participating, and optimized the path to reaching a mutually acceptable, if not agreeable, result. ```

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Please drop by the pad and feel free to add.
