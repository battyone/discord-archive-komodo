Downdate seems like that might not be a bad option for a bitcoin node.

wouldn't hold your breath on this, if it is actual network problems, we won't notarize at all

paxmatches is usually the amount of nodes that agree on a blockhash, yes?

`ht.112640 [0] ips.43 BEER NOTARIZE.13 matches.16 paxmatches.13 bestmatches.12 bestk.10:-1 118

is this `paxmatches` number is the amount of nodes ready to notarize this height?

[27-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but they need to be in bestmask

[27-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you need 13 bestmatches

[27-Apr-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
one more node to go

[27-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Alright#0419
what is the difference between the 2?

[27-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Alright#0419
best vs pax

[27-Apr-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember exactly about paxmatches, but likely it is all the nodes that agree on all the notarization data

[27-Apr-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so it could be the total number of nodes

[27-Apr-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
bestmatches can only be max of 13 and must be the specific nodes

[27-Apr-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
likely one of the node isnt connected to all the other nodes, just one connection missing in one direction would prevent the crossconnect logic from selecting a node and if that was one of the paxmatches node, you wont have the 13 needed

[27-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Decker#3767 (pinned)
@Alright i have saved explanation of paxmatches and bestmatches from past:

```0x7fb82c606620 ht.814690 [0] ips.43 KMD NOTARIZE.14 matches.15 paxmatches.41 bestmatches.9 bestk.60 190061600b012010 recv.7fc27f67df27e619 sigmasks.(0 0) senderind.60 state.0 (866fa306 0 0) MoM.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 [0]

ips.43 -> 20+ nodes not connected to the notary network on port 17775. make sure your firewall isnt blocking 17775
paxmatches.41 means that most of the 43 nodes are submitting the first iteration of data and it is matching
bestmatches 9 means there are 9 (of 14) nodes from bestk.60 that are within the paxmatches
```
