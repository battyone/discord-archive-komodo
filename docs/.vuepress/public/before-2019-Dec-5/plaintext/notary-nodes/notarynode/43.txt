It doen't mean that don't have value

[15-Mar-19 11:38 AM] Ludom#5832
BTC is a store of value

[15-Mar-19 11:39 AM] Ludom#5832
Komodo could be too ( 🙏 ) but it's almost for me a bridge in the Komodo ecosystem and technology

[15-Mar-19 11:42 AM] Ludom#5832
That's my opinion.

[15-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Ludom#5832
For me the priorities are : building a strong decentralized infrastructure and developping usecases that use our infrastructure

[15-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Lumbi#8378
The 'value' of KMD's notary system lies in its *impartiality*... a paradox,  no? 😉

[15-Mar-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
plz discuss this sort of thing in #politics

`also NN operators should be limited to 1 NN in  max 1 region` <-- this assumes we have at least 64 competent NN ops who also have the time/finances to maintain a NN, and that is not quite the case. I would estimate it's closer to 50. Also, once you are a really good op, and have things automated, it makes sense to expand to multiple regions

[15-Mar-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't support a total newbie person who has never been a NN op running in 4 regions, and I think most NN ops would look poorly upon that

[15-Mar-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also, it splits your vote and you would probably go mad trying to make it all work, if elected

[15-Mar-19 12:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I disagree that a YouTube should get a node based on Influence.    This is where I think @Ludom was going yesterday, and I do agree.   I haven’t heard much since then about KMD from said person.   
This whole year I have been excited for these up coming elections as I’ve been a nonstop participant and contributor.  

Really looking forward to many years with KMD.

[15-Mar-19 12:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There was a time where people were looking at this from a cash return.

[15-Mar-19 12:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But they have all disappeared.   I wonder if they’ll even run this year.

[15-Mar-19 12:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Watching the NN channels all year says there’s a lot to do.  
MrLynch and I won’t let the constituents down if we get in.  ❤️

[15-Mar-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you are thinking about running a NN for the money, let me save you some time: Leave this discord and go live a simple life.

[15-Mar-19 12:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
😂

[15-Mar-19 12:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
Running a NN is not for the weekend sysadmin, this is a full-time job

[15-Mar-19 12:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
not doing it for the moniez

[15-Mar-19 12:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
MrLynch said “I’m going part time to run this”. 

My response. 😬

[15-Mar-19 12:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
doing it for KMD and ARRR

[15-Mar-19 12:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But hey... I’m all about helping him!   That’s why he’s getting the operator portion 100%.   I’m doing this for exposure and supporting the ecosystem.  Nothing to do with KMD rewards.

[15-Mar-19 12:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
my mantra is: focus on the job, get it done right... rewards are just an aftermath

[15-Mar-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's nonlinear, as well. Some weeks, nothing happens and everything is groovy. Some weeks there are mandatory updates every few hours to chase down some production bug and it's just madness

[15-Mar-19 12:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
not taking 100% btw, i know what the donation address is if u don't take it 😜

[15-Mar-19 12:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Like December 2018? :trollface:

[15-Mar-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
and sometimes the network is fine but your node decided to 💩 the bed and you go debugging things for dozens of hours

[15-Mar-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
restarting the NN daemons takes time, and the network takes time to see you. Nothing is short, simple or quick

[15-Mar-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
blackjoker spent countless hours sacrificing his uptime to improve the system

[15-Mar-19 12:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
From what I can tell that dudes been a superhero the past 18 months.

[15-Mar-19 12:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As much as one can be going from 0-100 coding skill in such a short amount of time.   Very impressive.

[15-Mar-19 12:35 PM] kolo#1111
I knew ops asking how to SSH back than and committing code now

[15-Mar-19 12:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
i guess i have a leaner learning curve then 😜

[15-Mar-19 12:36 PM] kolo#1111
So noobs are possible. It's just not that easy to commit parttime job for free for the long time

[15-Mar-19 12:37 PM] kolo#1111
Also last year KMD was up to 16 bucks

[15-Mar-19 12:37 PM] kolo#1111
Made nodes mad money printing machines.

[15-Mar-19 12:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've planned for this... i'll be fine 😬

[15-Mar-19 12:52 PM] Strob#3417
@dukeleto Just to clarify, by saying it's a full time job I guess you mean you have to be available full time but the real work probably take no more than 25 hours a week? Is that right?

[15-Mar-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob no, what I said

[15-Mar-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
just reading the private NN discord channel is a part-time job

[15-Mar-19 12:56 PM] Strob#3417
Ok someone else told me lazy nodes put 20 hours a month and the best one 100 hours a month. but you say how many hours a week?

[15-Mar-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, external coins take up a lot of time, and we keep adding more (no thanks to me)

[15-Mar-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not giving any hours/week estimate, there is no average week

[15-Mar-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's up to each NN. The less time you spend, the shittier your stats, and the less likely you will be auto-re-elected

[15-Mar-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
the people that spend very little time per month, they spent hundreds of hours perfecting their automation

[15-Mar-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
and no matter what, when an external coin breaks, or there is a CVE in BTC/KMD, or 1000 other reasons, you will be a sysadmin in the middle of the night with no warning

[15-Mar-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a full time job

[15-Mar-19 12:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
the best NNs monitor their systems all the time, with notifications to telegram/SMS if bad breakages happen

[15-Mar-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
One notary node is about 50 cryptocoin daemons running happily, with iguana glue. Keeping it all working is a juggling act, and usually at least some small part is broken and being researched

[15-Mar-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
each NN decided what is worth doing and how often to update

[15-Mar-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
Updating too often will kill your uptime, so you have to be strategic about it

[15-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Strob#3417
Ok so every node is different then? depending on each NN op?

[15-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Strob#3417
I thought there was a very precise coordination to get everything the exact same on each node.

[15-Mar-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
Every NN has to run certain coin daemons, and iguana. The way the node is setup, which OS and all that, is up to the admin

[15-Mar-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not good to have identical setups

[15-Mar-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
then if there is a single exploit, all are vulnerable

[15-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Strob#3417
Ok

[15-Mar-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
some NN ops use docker, most don't. Some use Redhat iirc, most use Debian/Ubuntu

[15-Mar-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't think anybody runs a NN on FreeBSD or Windows, nor do I think anybody should try. Unless you are a really special snowflake.

[15-Mar-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
so we are diverse, while also having very stringent requirements for cooperating via NN network

[15-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Strob#3417
In you case can you tell me if you could at least get a few contract jobs other than operating your node to make a living or you could just live the whole year with the meager reward?

[15-Mar-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
the NN network uses nanomsg, and so basically, all notary nodes try to keep connections open to others, as best they can. (This is a convenient lie, I am sure James can go into depth about this)

[15-Mar-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob that depends completely on your monthly expenses, location, and future expected expenses

[15-Mar-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and skills

[15-Mar-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if you cant do unix command line, then it will need a lot more time

[15-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Strob#3417
haha I wouldn't even think about this if I could NOT use a command line.

[15-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Strob#3417
I already have the hardware (I have a rack of 1 u servers meeting the specs) and even many more powerful workstations. a 300MBPS connection on both sides. But I don't think I can spend 40 hours a week only on operating the nodes for the full years. I could spend a few week at 100 if needed. But I also need to work on my regular business VFX 3D and 3D animation business. I can decide how many hours I spend on my regular business most of the time but I can't just stop it. So maybe I can't be a NN operator if it takes so many hours. I maintain my own render farm of 16 computers, ftp server, designed and maintained a few externally hosted websites since 1995. I mined on windows and linux many different coins since 2014. So I am mostly an artist but still highly technical in many aspects (mainly fluid sims and all kinds of VFX, with some scripting in maxscript, melscript, houdini VEX, VOP) but I'm not a coder. So I guess I would need to put a lot more time than most others NN op. I would like to try it for 2 or 3 months and see if I can do it for a full year before proposing. So maybe I will propose next year instead.

[15-Mar-19 01:17 PM] jorian#4555
we will set up a testnet (i hope) to see what it is and to show that you're capable

[15-Mar-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob you sound like a good candidate, if you sysadmin a bunch of machines already

[15-Mar-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes do the testnet for NN and you can get a feel for it. if you already are a sys admin, that is most of the experience needed

[15-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Strob#3417
But I did it only on windows so far.. But always wanted to switch on linux and started just recently and so far I love it but still not a pro on it.

[15-Mar-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Sysadmin skills really help in all the day-to-day management of NN servers. Dev skills really help when you are chasing down inevitable bugs/problems, and allows you to sometimes "help yourself" instead of waiting on somebody else to fix it. We have plenty of really good NN ops who are amazing sysadmins, but not developers

@p0nd3ea I’m no Dev... but I have looked into being a notary node.    Now, if I were to fork a coin that had an aspect like that, I would use it (because it’s a great feature) or disable it.   Not leave it open in the code and pretend like it is erroneous.     #whengra...

@Strob if you are not comfortable with compiling your own code on Linux CLI, then that is a bare necessity for being a NN op

[15-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Strob#3417
My own code?

[15-Mar-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
no, BTC/KMD and all the code that runs a NN server

[15-Mar-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
some can be done from packages, some not

[15-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Strob#3417
I could compile the rogue game on linux and play it.

[15-Mar-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob ok, that is pretty good 😃

[15-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Strob#3417
But the instructions were clear and the command line on linux is easier to use than on windows I think.

[15-Mar-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i estimate a NN has about a dozen different git repos, which you must constantly keep up-to-date, compile, reboot and sometimes switch branches between

[15-Mar-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
NN ops need to be familiar with git

[15-Mar-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
nothing crazy advanced, but the basics

[15-Mar-19 01:26 PM] Strob#3417
I think I  would be able to handle this. Anyway like James said I will try the tesnet and we'll see.

@Strob i support this, you sound like a strong candidate

[15-Mar-19 01:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
The biggest reason to become a KMD NN operator is how much learning you do. I can't even describe how much I have learned from being a NN op.

[15-Mar-19 01:31 PM] Strob#3417
Ok thanks! My main goal is to learn but I don't want to screw up and I hope to do it the best I can. If we need to keep up to date that's something I am expert at. I always update all my systems, plugins and 3D app to get the latest feature and also beta tested v-ray, phoenixFD, 3ds max, blender.

[15-Mar-19 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
my blender needs an update, thanks for reminding
