why do you need the 24 words passphrase if you have your compressed WIF already ? If that's for using the `genkomodo.php` then here's the tweak:
- replace `$k` in `$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKey($k)` (line 141) with your private key in hex format https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/genkomodo.php#L141
- ofc you'll need to convert your compressed WIF to the private key, here's how:
convert your WIF from base58 to hex, using a tool like this (offline of course) http://lenschulwitz.com/base58
once you obtain your WIF in  hex format , for example :
```BC10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C01168A5381```
remove the first 2 characters (BC = 188 in hex which is the wif type of KMD) & the last 10 characters (`01`-this is the compression byte and `168A5381` - this is the first 4 bytes of the double SHA256 checksum of all the previous bytes). Then you'll have:
```10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C```
This is the private key that you'll need to insert in the first step

enter KMD, BTC, GAME, EMC2, GIN, or SUQA wif and
it will output KMD, BTC, GAME, EMC2, GIN, and SUQA wifs with matching pubkey```

awesome guys, thanks

i was going to investigate myself but this is easier

[27-May-19 10:26 AM] SHossain#0007
seed works as additional layer of backup. you can also export WIF from a seed, but can't do other way

[27-May-19 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
however, iguana works with both

[27-May-19 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
if you already have your NN server ready and securely setup, you can just create and import the privkey and validate address to get pubkey and all other required info

[27-May-19 10:28 AM] SHossain#0007
**Security** is important in your server as the seed/WIF will be stored in plain-text inside iguana dir

[27-May-19 11:04 AM] And1_89#6578
it's not intended to use wif, only passphrases.

but if you want to use WIF change line:

$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKey($k);


on

$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKeyWithWif($passphrase);

@kolo can you clear up the conversation we had yesterday in pm? Specifically in relation to the 2nd pubkey and not importing it yet.

Hello everyone. We are configuring the node and it seems that we have a problem with HUSH3. When we try to see the debug log, it does not exist, it has not been started correctly. I am also seeing that in assetchains.old there is no initialization for HUSH3.

[27-May-19 12:17 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
Is this something that already happened to anyone else?

[27-May-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@Carlos Crypto Economy hush has its own repository (<https://github.com/MyHush/hush3>) and is built as an external chain

We are having a little problem with CHIPS too, it seems that there is no peers? - "connect() to 5.9.253.195:57777 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)"

[27-May-19 12:40 PM] Decker#3767
and there is an other reason, why shouldn't do that. bcz on different systems hush3 daemon binary have different paths. mean, on my node it can be like `/home/decker/hush3/src/komodod` and on other it can be `/home/user/hush3mylovelycoin/src/komodod` )
