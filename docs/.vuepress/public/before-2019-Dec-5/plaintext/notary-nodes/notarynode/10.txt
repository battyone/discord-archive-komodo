For my NN I have 2 deamons one that mines and one that does Notary stuff... so I just dont refresh the mining node and use that to send balance to self after removing wallet.dat on Notary Node.

may be needed for gamecredits build: sudo apt-get install libssl1.0-dev

[29-Jun-18 10:54 AM] gcharang#6833
Should I just add it as it won't hurt, or wait for confirmation from others? @metaphilibert

[29-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <metaphilibert> I needed it every time I build gamecredits (on debian 9)

[29-Jun-18 11:12 AM] gcharang#6833
Ok. I will add it. As it might have been come as default with Ubuntu.

[29-Jun-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its only needed for Debian9

[29-Jun-18 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
And I found it better to just compile the openssl and put into the gamecredits folder then point gamecreditsd at it, so it didnt stuff up my other coins.

[29-Jun-18 02:07 PM] gcharang#6833
```
In Debian9 you might need to do ``sudo apt-get install libssl1.0-dev`` or compile the openssl and place it in the Gamecredits folder and point ``gamecreditsd`` at it, so that it wouldn't interfere with other coin daemons.
```
I will add this.

so about empty assetchains in Notary nodes, its responsability of assetchain creators to fill the nodes with funds to notarize right?

[02-Jul-18 06:26 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if no funds provided, no notarizations

If I were an assetchain operator I would only be funding top ranking nodes in each region to get a notarization from time to time. If 13 NN rule applies to AC notarization which I'm not totally sure...

[02-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
What about consensus if you select specific nodes among all of them ?

[02-Jul-18 07:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even if not notarizing each node has a role : takeover when some are not avail / on maintenance / any lag. That just theorically allow a 100% uptime

[02-Jul-18 07:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kimmel (Pungo.io) that is an interesting idea, but then the window for 51% attacks increases, because if you only fund the top performers, sometimes you will have longer stretches of attack windows, when underperforming notaries do the the notarization. It does seem like a way to save money via sacrificing some security.

[02-Jul-18 08:23 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if AC has no mining, no 51% attack...?

[02-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> You need to produce blocks somehow, Kimmel. Staking for example.

[02-Jul-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> is possible for any consensus algo, we can only mitigate it, and Komodo does it really well, with redundancy of algos (dPoW and PoW, and probably hybrid staking in the future for assetchains).

[02-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> It's almost impossible to get 51% at everything (BTC + Komodo dPoW + notary network + coordinate everything).

[02-Jul-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Imagine doing that with a hybrid staking assetchain coin, even more difficult.

[02-Jul-18 11:05 PM] Alright#0419
hybrid POS/POW coins are possible right now
