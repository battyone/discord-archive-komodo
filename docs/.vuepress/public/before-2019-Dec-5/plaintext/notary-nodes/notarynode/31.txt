You do have your chain and it was free for you doing it, right?

[06-Dec-18 11:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why would erc20 at $2500 price be an example?

[06-Dec-18 11:52 AM] Lumbi#8378
@siu - Chainmakers if I added up the hours of POS64 that took me down the rabbit hole, I don't think I'd be ahead on DIY ^^

[06-Dec-18 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I missed you here

[06-Dec-18 11:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I got confused, dont know whar you are talking about now

[06-Dec-18 11:54 AM] Lumbi#8378
DIY = doing it yourself is not cost effective üòâ

[06-Dec-18 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
From what youbsay here, its more cost effective than paying a yearly fee for someone to actively work for a year to secure your network

[06-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Lumbi#8378
365KMD/365LUMBER is a lot to ask... especially if KMD/LUMBER hit $1000. Why make things more difficult than they have to be?

if you cant afford to pay a few thousand to secure your chain, then just run an unsecured chain

@jl777c how "unsecured" is a  60/40 PoS / PoW hybrid KMD asset chain ?

[07-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Lumbi#8378
....the 365KMD already cost me a few thousand

[07-Dec-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you want it to be very secure make the PoS higher

[07-Dec-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then dont give anyone any coins

@Lumbi why not buy some KMD now? it is around $0.5 now. $200 worth will get you more KMD needed for 1 year

@Deleted User we've got an ERC20 called TALLY that we plan on keeping. @SHossain I am loading up on KMD on the way down to lower the average buy in price. I just don't like the additional fiat cost of dPoW.

[07-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Lumbi#8378
how about a double KMD payment for the first year of dPoW? üòâ

[07-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Lumbi#8378
365x2?

[07-Dec-18 06:33 PM] SHossain#0007
nope. no double payment.

hi

[07-Dec-18 07:01 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
a bit like a quality control in accounting like when they check to make sure credits and debits add up

[07-Dec-18 07:02 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
is it recorded in hexidecimals?

[07-Dec-18 07:02 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
base 16

[07-Dec-18 07:03 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
sure. Im watching

6 is 6 and f is 15

[07-Dec-18 07:12 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
also it represents decimal number is groups of 4

[07-Dec-18 07:12 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
so every hexidecimal character is a goup of 4 binary numbers

[07-Dec-18 07:12 PM] molody(Pungoio)#2849
Hi, guys

[07-Dec-18 07:12 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512

what is a utxo?

[07-Dec-18 07:16 PM] Alright#0419
@GlorymanRTS mastering bitcoin and komodo whitepaper will teach you so much

[07-Dec-18 07:16 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
oh i see, I guess one character for 4 binary characters does look neater.

[07-Dec-18 07:16 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
i see

[07-Dec-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
utxo is unspent transaction output

[07-Dec-18 07:17 PM] Alright#0419
read mastering bitcoin for more detail

[07-Dec-18 07:18 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
yeah, I will. thanks for having faith in me guys

@Deleted User you're confusing me, so I can only imagine how he feels right now

[07-Dec-18 07:21 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
The last hexidedimals I looked at had 0x in front of them to index it but none of these numbers have them

imagine the notes are utxos and coins are satoshis

[07-Dec-18 07:25 PM] SHossain#0007
but, all of them are UTXOs, even the satoshis

[07-Dec-18 07:26 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
oh so utxos are just lots of satoshis

[07-Dec-18 07:26 PM] Alright#0419

both of your analogies are bad üòõ

[07-Dec-18 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
Total balance: 335.32 EUR
16 UTXOS (includes notes and coins)

[07-Dec-18 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
each individual value is an individual utxo
based on the image ^^

[07-Dec-18 07:28 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
I read that utxos are like codes that are responsible for starting and ending a transaction? right?

[07-Dec-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
Alright
Just let him read mastering bitcoin and come back with questions

[07-Dec-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810

That works better

[10-Dec-18 05:53 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah.  Read mastering bitcoin.  Much more effective teaching.  Captivating!!!
In your pocket is your wallet.  Inside wallet is government issued fixed size utxo.  ‚ÄúPackets of value‚Äù

@molody(Pungoio) that `komodod: wallet/wallet.cpp:1183: void CWallet::DecrementNoteWitnesses(const CBlockIndex*): AssertionnWitnessCacheSize > 0' failed.` is an interesting error, some people have seen it on HUSH recently too. It seems to be rare

[15-Dec-18 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326

that contains the fix.

[20-Dec-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
basically if it falls so far under your limit... or 0 ... you know its fauiling to split

[20-Dec-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you send the balance to self, and wiat fior confirm before issuing the split fund

[20-Dec-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that also contains an error check, that will fail to do anything if there are 0 uspsents (its already sent to self but isnt confirmed)

[20-Dec-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I run this every 15mins and its working perfectly
