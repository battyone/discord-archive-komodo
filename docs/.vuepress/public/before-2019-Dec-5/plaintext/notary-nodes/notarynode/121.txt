You tipped @CHMEX **30 KMD**

[12-Apr-19 03:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
Wow thank you very much!!

[12-Apr-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and ty as well
what you do and how you do it makes my life and my OCD much easier

[12-Apr-19 03:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thats feels good to read. 🙏

[12-Apr-19 03:26 PM] newvulcan#4719
Has anyone seen komodod essentially go runaway with CPU ? Mine has, grabbed 100%, and has basically said to all other processes "My CPU, p*** off !"

[12-Apr-19 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only when I was on a single core vm

[12-Apr-19 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
are you trying to mine with it?

[12-Apr-19 03:28 PM] newvulcan#4719
Hmm, yes for TXS, though I have a 16 core processor, it ought to be able to handle it really.

[12-Apr-19 03:29 PM] newvulcan#4719
I think I'll reboot, take TXS out of the equation and see how it handles then

[12-Apr-19 03:30 PM] newvulcan#4719
Yes, its the TXSCLCC  process of komodod that seems to have gone runaway

[12-Apr-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many threads did you tell it to mine with?

[12-Apr-19 03:31 PM] newvulcan#4719
Just the 1

[12-Apr-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it ate up 100% of all 16 cores? 😮

[12-Apr-19 03:33 PM] newvulcan#4719
Would explain why I was notarizing quite happily with BEER this morning, then everything stopped after I reindexed TXSCLCC and started mining. I'll reboot and take a look at my setups

[12-Apr-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I still can't see how you set 1 thread and it ate up 16 cores

[12-Apr-19 03:35 PM] newvulcan#4719
I'll check  mainlog on the server. Its always possible its a hardware fault

[12-Apr-19 04:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
do `htop`

[12-Apr-19 04:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
that should tell u what's eating it

[12-Apr-19 04:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
look at tree mode

[12-Apr-19 04:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_assumed that was done and how the conclusion was arrived at; now guesses he shouldn't assume_

[12-Apr-19 04:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
never assume 😉

[12-Apr-19 04:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
`I think I'll reboot, take TXS out of the equation and see how it handles then`
why reboot tho?

Instead of the usual

[12-Apr-19 07:18 PM] And1_89#6578
which was the script to keep utxo small?

[12-Apr-19 07:24 PM] And1_89#6578
dont i add utxo with that

[12-Apr-19 07:26 PM] newvulcan#4719
I know I have to be patient, but I've only notarized 6 BEER and nothing else in the past 10 hours or so. Everything appears to be working - I have a log file for iguana running. The only thing I've noticed is a recurrent message "error signing raw PIZZA utxoduplicates tx don't have PIZZA utxo, please send funds" which is odd 'cause I've lots of utxo for each of the coins. Autosplitting seems to be working, and my utxo balance is getting really large as its not being used.

[12-Apr-19 07:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@And1_89 that is how you create utxos, yes

[12-Apr-19 07:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can use `./komodo-cli sendtoaddress $address $(komodo-cli getbalance) "" "" true`

[12-Apr-19 07:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
to merge them into a single utxo

[12-Apr-19 07:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
and then use the split script to split however many you want

[12-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Greer#0666
Since getting involved with this Notary Node business I've eaten pizza 3 out of 5 days.  Coincidence?  I think not. 🍕

[12-Apr-19 07:49 PM] SHossain#0007
i lost count how many 🍕

[12-Apr-19 08:23 PM] Strob#3417
BTW @And1_89 you sent me some BEER the other day. I guess you just went to the faucet to get more...

[12-Apr-19 08:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
for the love of god please read/check whatever script you're running

[12-Apr-19 08:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
after fighting with iguana for close to 12h we now made peace and back to #1 for the past 6h 😁

[12-Apr-19 08:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahah iguana's can be quite fiesty

@gt did you find any solution for listunspent bug?

[13-Apr-19 04:14 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r node is in this state again if you want to try to help me debug this

[13-Apr-19 04:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been seeing more of these than I'm confortable with -
 `{"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"}`

done a few things over the last 2 days to resolve, ntx counts way down, though they still happen sporadically. 
fresh wallets, send to self, restart chains, reboot server, restart iguana, checked ports, blocked non connecting seed node ips, addenodes, removed nodes. 

Could that error be due to attmpting to notiarise two chains in close succession?

Would deleteing peers.dat and /or other ~/.komodo  user data help?
Also noticed updates to daemon in dev branch, just pulled and rebuild, yet to restart. if it improves, will advise. Suggestions welcomed.

[13-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Alright#0419
might not even be you @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[13-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Alright#0419
might be someone else's node messed up in the notarization round

[13-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
mine 😛

[13-Apr-19 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
happening fairly regularly... All I know is my node is stuggling to notarise onver the last few days and I cant figure out why.

[13-Apr-19 04:35 AM] CrisF#3405
I had one of those a few minutes ago and have been getting a few over the last 6 hours or so.

[13-Apr-19 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
every change I've been patient to wait and see if improves so not poking too much and causing issues with running scripts too close togather

[13-Apr-19 04:37 AM] gt#2812
@Alright  getting utxos and walletcleaned on a second node and then sent to  another address, funded again and then a walletreset seems to might have done the trick

[13-Apr-19 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I know in LABs we had those sometimes when people didnt update daemons. Could this be the cause? We're on dev branch right? are some updating and others aren't?

[13-Apr-19 04:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm running `TXSCLCC` on FSM.
Others on dev/jl777..

[13-Apr-19 04:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
or do I just have the poor luck of being closest in ping to someone messing up ntx :troll_hmm:  ?

[13-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
there should be more info in stdout @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[13-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
as to why it failed

[13-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
that error you posted is very broad

[13-Apr-19 04:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been racking brain to try and figure out what I was doing wrong or hadnt thought of yet

[13-Apr-19 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not positive it's me, but my node keeps going into a bad state after a few hours

[13-Apr-19 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
tired of trying to figure out why, just redoing everything

[13-Apr-19 04:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I suspected my iguana was crashing earlier too

[13-Apr-19 04:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm just foing a BEER split, not involved in any Notarizations atm though :/

[13-Apr-19 04:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
had it so stdout was feeding into log, and then tailing it. seemed to just stop tailing after a few hours.

[13-Apr-19 04:43 AM] CrisF#3405
I was wondering if the previous one was do to another split that I had going through...

[13-Apr-19 04:43 AM] gt#2812
with import false i had to make sure to first start split with acsplit and not splitfunds

[13-Apr-19 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
while rescanning is progress number 100 or 1

[13-Apr-19 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
like is it counting to 1 or 100

[13-Apr-19 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
please tell me 1 🙏

[13-Apr-19 04:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
10000000

[13-Apr-19 04:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
nah its 1

[13-Apr-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@gt  what is difference? I'm using `utxosplitter.sh`

[13-Apr-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
looks like that uses splitfunds

[13-Apr-19 04:48 AM] gt#2812
right

[13-Apr-19 04:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
100 is like percentage :p

[13-Apr-19 04:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol

[13-Apr-19 04:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s 1 :p

[13-Apr-19 04:49 AM] gt#2812
so i've had to start with ac split first and then let utxosplitter take over after

[13-Apr-19 04:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
isn t utxosplitter just a looped acsplit ? :troll:

[13-Apr-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
its looped splitfunds

[13-Apr-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
acsplit looks much simpler

[13-Apr-19 04:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
iguana call easily scriptable
