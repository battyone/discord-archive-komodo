not sure if @blackjok3r @patchkez have read in #ask-jl777 about 24 hours ago, talk of an all-in-one komodod with electrum docker container.  check it out - utilising komodod's bitcore integrations.

Trying to work out whats wrong with my notary since the update/f4a/attack ... it seems KMD is on a fork?

[27-Jun-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have tried going back to yesterdays iguana... Is anyone who updated to newest KMD having issues...

[27-Jun-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have abnormally high network bandwidth and I am getting flooded with `bestmatches.0`

[27-Jun-18 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
AC are simpley not notarizing, I had a few BTC and a fre CHIPS/GAME but no AC at atll.

[27-Jun-18 10:19 AM] patchkez#5349
@blackjok3r I updated everything today, it seems I have the same issues, some BTC/CHIPS/GAME notarizations here, but not ACs

[27-Jun-18 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am reverting everything back to this commit: 4c36b53066e5a15896f556f1cbf9ab535868aacb

on komodo... on iguana I dont think its a problem, but I gone back to the commit where my node was on fire

[27-Jun-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yesterday.

[27-Jun-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone who has not yet updated, I would advise not to, you are the only nodes notarizing all AC, I will come back and join you soon. 😄

[27-Jun-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
did KMD go on a fork with the new version?

[27-Jun-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... it appears soo..

[27-Jun-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we had notarizations on it, AC wont notarize on it/

[27-Jun-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we need some nodes who have not updated to tell us block hash

[27-Jun-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so AC went on a fork?

[27-Jun-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but not notarizing could be due to MoM mismatch

[27-Jun-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what it looks like...

[27-Jun-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was seeing a LOT of 0000's

[27-Jun-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the checkfork script only says that one of the data points for KMD is 200 blocks behind

[27-Jun-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everything else was ok.

[27-Jun-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
which data point is 200 blocks behind

[27-Jun-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181

that is mainchain, is anybody not on it?

[27-Jun-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am on that one for KMD.

[27-Jun-18 10:31 AM] patchkez#5349
me too

[27-Jun-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
AC not notarizing doesnt indicate KMD has forked, but rather AC notarization cant get consensus and if all of them are broken, it seems not that they are all on forks at the same time (almost impossible) but MoM data not having consensus

[27-Jun-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
lets pick an AC not notarizing and post the MoM it is trying to notarize

[27-Jun-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are nodes notarizing AC, just they did not update yet.

[27-Jun-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just reverted komodo to get my node notarizing again, can go back to newest if you like but will need to restart again.

[27-Jun-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so new KMD likely broke MoM calcs

[27-Jun-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IS that expected, did anything change? Should be all update to newest, its just a matter of not enough updated?

[27-Jun-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
lets pick an AC not notarizing and post the MoM it is trying to notarize

[27-Jun-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if we get values from people who updated KMD and from who didnt, we can see if that is the issue

[27-Jun-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
for now dont update until we figure this out

[27-Jun-18 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Jun-18 10:47 AM] patchkez#5349
yes

[27-Jun-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be for KMD and all assetchains

[27-Jun-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just updated back to newest to help

[27-Jun-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
had hardly any notarize all day anyway, and 3x normal yesterday.

[27-Jun-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if the MoM doesnt match, then it wont notarize

[27-Jun-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is a change in komodo or iguana?

[27-Jun-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a change in komodo, but iguana asks komodo for the data to put into the notarization

[27-Jun-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok updated both back to newest, we jst want one AC or a few?

Btw, @NNoperator is on Ubuntu 14 and could not compile the newest version today. So anyone who is still on 14.04 will need to update to at least 16.04.
