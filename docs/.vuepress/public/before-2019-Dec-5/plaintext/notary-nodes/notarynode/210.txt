Hi, I've gotten back into my account.  Thanks for the advice, @kolo !

`CVE-2018-15664: docker (all versions) is vulnerable to a symlink-race attack`

[28-May-19 02:02 PM] Mylo#8306
yep as good as docker is for some things, i let the docker NN dream go in december.   thanks duke

[28-May-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's super useful for local testing, I give it that. But there are just too many docker-isms for me to ever trust it for prod

Considering SELinux as a fix 😃

@deleted-role going to use this testnet to test notary hard fork for Pirate as it's a special case. I need some people to submit an additional pubkey. Once I have enough new pubkeys, we can start an ac_private chain with a special branch of komodod. We'll set hard fork activation about 2-3 days past start time. Once hard fork activation passes, we will switch to the new pubkey you provided

https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/ARRRhf/src/komodo_defs.h

if you can simulate you being autoreelected with current key and then running a separate instance of iguana with an additional newly elected key, go on dexstats and find someone not running their NN and replace their key with your new one. Otherwise, just replace your's with a new one

would prefer PRs, but can change it myself if you just pm me and I confirm I saw it

we need some keys to stay the same, so if you can run an additional instance of iguana for a new key while still running the old key's iguana, this will help

@CHMEX @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator could either of you run an additional instance of iguana afterwards? ie simulate you being autoreelected with current key and then an additional newly elected key?

[29-May-19 04:11 AM] Alright#0419
no worries if not, don't need too many people to do it

[29-May-19 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
this test is actually relatively simple, but I figured we'd give this testnet something to do 😂 Fairly confident there will be no hiccups with the actual hard fork, but may as well test it to be sure

[29-May-19 04:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
I can yes

[29-May-19 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

@Alright I can run as separate node/iguana (want to test a little server prepared for mainnnet)

[29-May-19 04:37 AM] Alright#0419
added

[29-May-19 07:01 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright I'll send a new key and keep running the old.

[29-May-19 08:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
Hi CrisF

[29-May-19 08:08 AM] zatJUM#9924
Can you give me a peer ip for chipsd please?

[29-May-19 08:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
@zatJUM

[29-May-19 08:23 AM] zatJUM#9924
thanks

[29-May-19 08:28 AM] zatJUM#9924
Is 57777 p2p or rpcport?

[29-May-19 08:28 AM] zatJUM#9924
How can I know it from cli?

[29-May-19 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
`getinfo`

[29-May-19 08:50 AM] Alright#0419
oh wait, chips...

[29-May-19 08:59 AM] zatJUM#9924
yes, chips 😉

[29-May-19 09:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Ah, sorry @zatJUM , just saw this now and see you've got them,
Thanks, CHMEX!

[29-May-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, not sure on the port.  @jorian would know the port.

[29-May-19 09:19 AM] jorian#4555
57776

[29-May-19 09:19 AM] jorian#4555
is the rpcport

{Reactions}
🙏 

[29-May-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Jorian got it, @zatJUM  😃

[29-May-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Jorian, how can you find it from cli?

[29-May-19 09:20 AM] jorian#4555
so 57777 is the p2p

[29-May-19 09:20 AM] jorian#4555
no, netstat

[29-May-19 09:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Awesome, thanks a lot!

[29-May-19 09:24 AM] zatJUM#9924
If 57777 is p2p, it seems `chips-cli getnetworkinfo | jq .localaddresses` displays it fine

[29-May-19 09:24 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks jorian

my new pubkey `02a4a6c21b41a3903ef9ca37617d1b93fe74c9b5d5cc72d67b4e3524981f334acd`

[29-May-19 07:18 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain for ARRR testing?

[29-May-19 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[29-May-19 07:22 PM] Alright#0419
should I just change your key or will you run the old key as well?

[29-May-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...in that case i can run with old key

[29-May-19 07:23 PM] SHossain#0007
it's already running

[29-May-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
yea we'll need some people to stay the same as well

[29-May-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
although tony and chmex have keys that will be in both seasons

[29-May-19 07:24 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me stay the same then

[29-May-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
can you just change your's?

[29-May-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
no need for a second iguana instance, just changing key

[29-May-19 07:25 PM] Alright#0419
no worries

[29-May-19 09:33 PM] Greer#0666
Hey, is there a reason that the hush daemon wasn't symlinked to `/usr/local/bin` in the instructions at https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/setup-Komodo-Notary-Node.html#compile-bitcoin-and-other-3rd-party-coins-from-source? ```shell
bitcoind &
chipsd &
gamecreditsd &

[29-May-19 09:36 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no reason. if you want to symlink it, do it

[29-May-19 09:36 PM] SHossain#0007
it will work either way

[29-May-19 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
the guide is just a general guidance. you can run your node your way

[29-May-19 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as the sim doesn't cause the bash script circle back to /usr/local/bin, I forget if hushd is dir linked or just ./

[29-May-19 09:39 PM] SHossain#0007
HUSH3 and VRSC uses `komodod`.  the normal komodod is already symlinked. `hushd` is just a script. you can symlink that along with `hush-cli`

[29-May-19 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`HUSH3 and VRSC uses komodod. `
all hush bits have been migrated to jl777/dev?

[29-May-19 09:40 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure about that. Dukeleto can tell

[29-May-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it would be better if we can use normal komodod to run HUSH3

[29-May-19 09:41 PM] SHossain#0007
just like any other AC

[29-May-19 09:41 PM] Greer#0666
ah, I see how its different now.  thanks

[29-May-19 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's been a bit since I tried hush params on "normal" komodod

[29-May-19 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't try hush params on normal komodod

[29-May-19 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
afaik, it had different codebase

[29-May-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's hard to keep track of what was pushed where and when, so I just run from src dir

[29-May-19 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can't keep track of things, that means Komodo ecosystem is growing 😛

something interesting that I just learnt, may be most people  already know this: 
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"method\":\"walletpassphrase\",\"params\":[\"$passphrase\", 9999999]}"
```
will return the same result for `$passphrase` = either  your 24 seeds words or your compressed/uncompressed WIF (of course they must attach to the same private key).
P/S: tested on StakedNotary iguana & testnet iguana

[29-May-19 10:53 PM] SHossain#0007
on testnet?

[29-May-19 10:55 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I tested it on StakedNotary iguana, not tested yet on testnet iguana

[29-May-19 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't work for me on mainnet

[29-May-19 10:56 PM] SHossain#0007
yep

[29-May-19 10:57 PM] SHossain#0007
ah! you are back to frog 😃

[29-May-19 10:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i like the frog

[29-May-19 10:58 PM] SHossain#0007
so, i didn't make bad choice by not symlinking hushd

[29-May-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_almost never links anything_

[29-May-19 11:00 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, `komodod` & `komodo-cli` is already symlinked

[29-May-19 11:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I cheat and alias cli or use a script for it

[29-May-19 11:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the main problem with links is if you move the dir it feks shit up

[29-May-19 11:02 PM] SHossain#0007
but, as i said, the guide is just a general purpose only and gives you idea how things works. many different ways to run a node and all related things. since all nodes has different specs and even OS version, i'm sure you will find your own way to managing.

[29-May-19 11:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i'm sure you will find your own way to managing.`
I just hope I manage not to screw it all up 😛

[29-May-19 11:04 PM] SHossain#0007
blackjok3r was not happy with the wallet.dat size which affected his performance and he coded the sh*t out and made `cleanwallettransactions`

[29-May-19 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
that helped everyone. thought that is not the best solution and it tends not to work sometimes afer a while, but, that still helps

[29-May-19 11:05 PM] SHossain#0007
as long as it is working

[29-May-19 11:06 PM] SHossain#0007
anytime there was issues, blackjok3r and Decker coded things to solve them or other helpful scripts

[29-May-19 11:06 PM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 don't worry, you will not screw it up

[29-May-19 11:07 PM] SHossain#0007
you already know how things works in Komodo. you even used the SuperNET repo before for barterDEX... things will be easy for you

[29-May-19 11:09 PM] SHossain#0007
and, things will be easier for LABS ops as well

[29-May-19 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you will not screw it up`
You might want to scroll back through the years before you say that :P
I don't think there's a single thing I've tried or been involved with that hasn't broken on me in a manner that no one else in the world (literally) has experienced 🤣

[29-May-19 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
well, if you manage to screw it up, you will learn something.

[29-May-19 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe you will find bugs

[29-May-19 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
indeed

[29-May-19 11:10 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe you will create bugs :troll:
