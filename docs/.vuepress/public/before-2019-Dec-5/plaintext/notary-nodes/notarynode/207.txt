Today I will try rebooting like 10 times, waiting an hour or 2 between each reboot.

[21-May-19 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe rebooting too much is the problem?

[21-May-19 07:50 PM] Strob#3417
Before today my last reboot was approx 4 days ago

I assume it prints in iguana tv still... I commetned them out on mine, but defaulty behaviour was to print it.

[21-May-19 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if you put a random string into that coin param i guess you'd probably find out`
bad coin name has a null return, so either it works or at least it thinks it works (no telling with joker's edits :troll: )

@Strob 
`uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(symbol, ccid, kmdheight-5, moms, destNotarisationTxid);`
If your comodod contins this in its source code that is why its not working. When I said check MoMoM this is what I meant. There are some branches that have the -5 in them, that will prevent you reaching consensus with all the nodes who do not ahve the -5.,

{Reactions}
😲 

[22-May-19 02:29 PM] Strob#3417
Hi blackjok3r, nice try but I just checked my crosschain.cpp and I don't have the -5. So it's not that. 
I get this: 
`uint256 MoMoM = CalculateProofRoot(targetSymbol, targetCCid, kmdHeight, moms, targetChainNotarisationTxid);
`

Hi @Dr.Terminus ,

the testnet data has currently stopped updating because some hardware failed

[24-May-19 08:55 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for the update @CHMEX .  Hope it isn't big thing 🤞

[24-May-19 09:50 AM] CHMEX#0686

[24-May-19 11:36 AM] CrisF#3405

I've had that before @Deleted User.

[24-May-19 01:01 PM] CrisF#3405
In my case I got it working again thanks to the help offered in the chat between these 2 comments:

This was the meat of it```There is 1 trick though:
delete wallet.dat
import notary private key with "" false 
then use z_import key on a random z address specifying the last 50,000 blocks only. then run
clean wallet transaction with no txid.```

Was beginning to wonder, haha.

because then you'd have to zap anyway

[24-May-19 02:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
@blackjok3r thanks, but seems that esxi doesnx't like hard raid so i'll go with proxmox + zfs instead

[24-May-19 02:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
wish me luck

[24-May-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm using hardware RAID with esxi but the esxi is installed on a pair of SD cards

[24-May-19 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
proxmox is pretty straighforward

[24-May-19 03:54 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User I am on esxi

[24-May-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
hardraid ? ^^

[24-May-19 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
I should check but I think that only 1 server have hard raid. Others are on softraid or no raid. I will check
