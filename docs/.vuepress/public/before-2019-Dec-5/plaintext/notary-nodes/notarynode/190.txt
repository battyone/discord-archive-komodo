and, the guide will be updated again

@CrisF just saw your message, don't forget this is a testnet, and it is intended to show that people can communicate / coordinate and work as a team. The 2nd role of a testnet, is to test :D.
In a real case scenario, I don't think we should expect any harm from other NN's, we just need to be prepared.
I have no doubt in case something goes wrong / an operator goes rogue he will just have all other NN chasing him. That s exacly what would happen to anyone harming my node, personnally. Am personally very cool with testnet stuff (even now I quitted), but the main NN is another subject, and I believe it s crystal clear for everyone ^^. This situation WILL happen, or MAY happen, the testnet here helped us to get safeguards.

[04-May-19 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
the other point being personal incentive VS network incentives

[04-May-19 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
typically affected by UTXO management

[04-May-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
on this point, we don't need rules, but "expected and recommended behaviour"

[04-May-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
It just makes me laugh to see people with 5 utxos

[04-May-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Guyz, I split by 100 when under 100, my node is 4th, so it works fine ?

[04-May-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
tweaking as long as it doesn t harm

[04-May-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
or induce an additionnal cost

[04-May-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
but that s another subject

[04-May-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I really believe we DO have protections that no other coins or very few have

[04-May-19 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
and am not talking about DPOW, but the ability of Joker / alright to dig and break and come up with a fancy solution

[04-May-19 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Shossain's node are 1st and second, and I think he used **autosplit**

[04-May-19 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
tweaking when there is a performance issue or a lack by >10 or 20 %, hell yeah

[04-May-19 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
to win 1% and just fuck the network, noneed

[04-May-19 04:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
on that point, I agree with you, but just on Mainnet ^^

[04-May-19 04:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i do use autosplit.

[04-May-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
manual split or split via cron is extra job

[04-May-19 04:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
to me, the goal is not to have  people too much low on performance, and just have a good average performance. No point getting 13  **uber** nodes

[04-May-19 04:15 PM] PHBA2061#2530
seems like notarizations start to pick up the pace

[04-May-19 05:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
still no BEER..

[04-May-19 05:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
other assets notarizing fine..

[04-May-19 07:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
what's the command to get the TXSCLCC daemon started?

[04-May-19 07:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
had to reboot

[04-May-19 07:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
I've got:
`./komodod -pubkey=xxxx -ac_name=TXSCLCC -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &`

[04-May-19 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@Lumbi how do you keep track of chain start command? i see you quite often ask for TXSCLCC start command. it is pinned in this channel

[04-May-19 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
save it in your server somewhere or in your local computer

[04-May-19 07:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
those parameters look correct
yeah you should save commands that you frequently use somewhere

[04-May-19 07:12 PM] phm87#7395
It should be in the readme of 2019testnet repo of Alright

[04-May-19 07:16 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it's in the testnet repo too

[04-May-19 07:19 PM] Lumbi#8378
thx üëç 
back to Iguana TV :troll_compadre:

[04-May-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain I can make a py script for key conversion if you like

[04-May-19 07:32 PM] Alright#0419
well actually have it already, just need to touch it up a bit

[04-May-19 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. i can list both method in the same page.

[04-May-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
slept in quite a bit, did I miss something here?

[04-May-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
see you said wait for Alright to someone

[04-May-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
what was that in reference to

[04-May-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
some ops were talking about changing minsig.

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
do we need to? I figured we would stop for now based on what jl said

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
because it was taking long to get ntrz started after your last change

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
no need

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
we were doing fine with 13 for a while

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
it has started notarizing

[04-May-19 07:34 PM] Alright#0419
can't understand why we're struggling at 11 now

[04-May-19 07:35 PM] SHossain#0007
someone mentioned that maybe some ops just reacted with thumbs up emoji rather than updating.

[04-May-19 07:35 PM] Alright#0419

[04-May-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
I noticed that I had to restart iguana 3 times before it would see any other nodes in masks

[04-May-19 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright i tested on mainnet today using `passphrase.txt` file inside iguana dir and commenting out `./wp_7776` file. it doesn't work on mainnet. shows `error signing nn packet`.

[04-May-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why

[04-May-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
should work just the same, didn't change anything iguana wise

[04-May-19 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i know. not sure why not working. tried multiple times in different way (with `""` and without, with passphrase and WIF). always same result. need a fresh node to test it again with mainnet key.

[04-May-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776/" --data "{\"method\":\"walletpassphrase\",\"params\":[\"$passphrase\", 9999999]}"` if $passphrase is correct, this shouldn't be any different on mainnet

[04-May-19 07:39 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe `walletpassphrase` decrypts and sign the nn packet

[04-May-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
ah maybe it relies on doing it with WIF

[04-May-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
don't think I've tested with actual seed phrase

[04-May-19 07:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i've tested with WIF too, before and after server reboot

[04-May-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
I'll test it out prior to mainnet, can't see why it would be any different

[04-May-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
we use it for LABS as well

[04-May-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
joker uses it on his mainnet node too I believe

[04-May-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
trying to get accurate info as i've started writing the guide.
yes, we can test before next mainnet.

[04-May-19 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
could be because i used `encryptwallet` call uisng the first `wp` command based on current mainnet guide and `wp_7776` file contains the `walletpassphrase` call. only way can be 100% sure by setting up a fresh node

[04-May-19 07:42 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how any of the guides expect it to work

[04-May-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
kind of figured it out through labs, all the guides at the time were wonky

[04-May-19 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
that guide was written almost 3 years ago and adapted throughout the time

[04-May-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
there's no reason you can't use the encryptwallet method

[04-May-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
but there's also no reason to use it

[04-May-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
the `encryptwallet` call was needed that time to display pubkey, privkey, address with 1 call

[04-May-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
from seed phrase

[04-May-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
Decker wasn't around to create his php script

[04-May-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
I've always just used WIFs, never seed phrases

[04-May-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
now we have tool to disply WIF without using `wp`. if you also put a py script, we will have more.

[04-May-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
he is thinking to rewrite the php script using C

[04-May-19 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
that would allow ops not to install php in their server

[04-May-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
i have scripts right now for WIF conversion, have to figure out how to use a seed phrase though

[04-May-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it's needed tbh

[04-May-19 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
having a seed is always better than having only WIF

[04-May-19 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
gives ability to generate the address in 2 different ways

[04-May-19 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
Can convert compressed wif to uncompressed wif and vice versa

[04-May-19 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
I'll figure out how to do it with seed phrase for those who want to use it though

[04-May-19 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
I guess this is kind of a nooby question, but how do OPs with like year up times handle kernel updates?

[04-May-19 08:05 PM] Alright#0419
just not do them?

[04-May-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i update and reboot my servers regularly.

[04-May-19 08:17 PM] SHossain#0007

1 and half hour ago last reboot

[04-May-19 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 do you only reboot when a kernel update is relevant?

[04-May-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007
who can do a quick proofread of this new mainnet setup guide? https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Setup-Komodo-Notary-Node
includes all coin setup instructions, example conf file. this is not final for the next season yet as we still need to understand how the 2 set of pubkeys will work. few things still needs to be udpated.
and, this will never be the end guide as there are multiple ways to do the same thing.  always looking forward to update the guide as necessary. if something is not understandable, please ask.

I'm reading it but I'm not sure that I'll be able to improve it

[04-May-19 09:04 PM] phm87#7395
Question: why using
```cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout beta```
and not 
```cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo -b beta
cd komodo``` ?

[04-May-19 09:05 PM] SHossain#0007
it's the same thing just different way of doing it

[04-May-19 09:05 PM] phm87#7395
yes but I prefer the shorter version

[04-May-19 09:05 PM] phm87#7395
and about ``./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`` I will add an explanation about nproc and parenthesis (I think we must remove parenthesis and type -j8 but I am not sure, I will check)

[04-May-19 09:06 PM] SHossain#0007
`and, this will never be the end guide as there are multiple ways to do the same thing.`
you can always use a shorter version. but, the guide is just a general purpose guideline.

[04-May-19 09:07 PM] phm87#7395
ok I understand

[04-May-19 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
blackjok3r has scripts to do most of it rather than using the guide

[04-May-19 09:08 PM] phm87#7395
yes but the guide is good to understand what is going on

[04-May-19 09:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`git checkout beta` this is easier to understand for people who are not familiar with github yet, rather than `git clone ... -b`

to install pools there are automated one-click script but you won't understand it if you don't read it (and risk of any error in the super script)

[04-May-19 09:11 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if it is normal but there is no chmod 600 on komodo.conf in the guide, I guessed that we can do it
