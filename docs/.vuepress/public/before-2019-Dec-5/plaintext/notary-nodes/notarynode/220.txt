you can mine the block but not be allowed to submit it to the blockchain it marks these as MAYBE_MINED... Pretty sure thats why it does it.

[05-Aug-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810

Hi,
When running ```komodo_cli -ac_name=${coin} sendtoaddress ${address} $(komodo_cli -ac_name=${coin} getbalance) "" "" true``` I'm getting `getbalance: command not found` and `sendtoaddress: command not found`.
I've tried many different combinations but can figure out how to get it working.
Does anyone know what is wrong?
(FSM barnch if that makes a difference)

[06-Aug-19 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`komodo-cli` not `komodo_cli`

[06-Aug-19 05:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, sorry that was a typo when putting it here, not in the script.

[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] CrisF#3405
```komodo-cli -ac_name=${coin} sendtoaddress ${address} $(komodo-cli -ac_name=${coin} getbalance) "" "" true```

[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] CrisF#3405
This is what's getting the `not found`.

[06-Aug-19 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
is $coin actually being set?

[06-Aug-19 05:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, `coin=$1
`

[06-Aug-19 05:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm trying to get Labs `walletreset.sh` to work on ACs.

[06-Aug-19 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I mean does $coin have an actual value set

[06-Aug-19 05:48 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if you echo it in the script, is it returning what you expect?

[06-Aug-19 05:48 AM] CrisF#3405
`./walletreset.sh PIZZA`

[06-Aug-19 05:48 AM] CrisF#3405
will check

[06-Aug-19 05:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`I'm trying to get Labs walletreset.sh to work on ACs.`
it already does 游땟

[06-Aug-19 05:49 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been able to get any of the walletresets I've tried to work.

[06-Aug-19 05:49 AM] CrisF#3405
Wondering if it's due to FSM branch?

[06-Aug-19 05:51 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
are you sure you have all of the scripts that it depends on and they are edited properly?

[06-Aug-19 05:53 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been through them a few times and think they are ok.
I tried removing the `$`s and just using the commands also. same errors.

[06-Aug-19 05:55 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
komodo-cli, in terminal, is returning command not found for getbalance? or the bash script is?

[06-Aug-19 05:56 AM] CrisF#3405
just the script

[06-Aug-19 05:56 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then you borked the script or the listclis.sh script

[06-Aug-19 05:57 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
that's the downside to daisy-chaining scripts; you can't see wtf you're doing because 1/2 of it is somewhere else

[06-Aug-19 05:57 AM] CrisF#3405
I tried hardcoding the `komodo-cli -ac_name=` but still errored.

[06-Aug-19 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
then try `cd`ing to where the cli file is and using `./`

[06-Aug-19 05:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, will try.

No more speeding up loops being able to give any advantage... Although I am doing it so that all nodes start a dpow round  as close together as possible, to reduce the chance of them not reaching consensus.

Hi @zatJUM, What did you edit on the script?

[06-Aug-19 07:35 AM] CrisF#3405
I've searched the error I was getting an it looks like I may need to update FSM.

[06-Aug-19 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
A bit concerned about screwing something up if I do though.
