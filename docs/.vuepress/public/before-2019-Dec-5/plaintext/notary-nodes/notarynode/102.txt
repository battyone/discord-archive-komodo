[07-Apr-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[07-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Ludom#5832
And how should we count the "number of completed notarizations"

[07-Apr-19 09:34 PM] Ludom#5832
That's a very important question

I made some tests and errors on some AC (I told it to @metaphilibert ), I learnt later that they have dpow. I hope that these tests and errors won't affect the definition of "top" and which AC are stable and unstable

[07-Apr-19 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
what kind of errors @phm87 ?

[07-Apr-19 09:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
@phm87 the point made is about bugs in the core

[07-Apr-19 09:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you uncovered them, the bugs were still there

[07-Apr-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
I mined a coin with 2 GPU, I didn't expect to have 99% of hashrate, the block explorer rebooted (lost its history)

[07-Apr-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
I have no clues if there are bugs into the core

[07-Apr-19 09:36 PM] SHossain#0007
which coin?

[07-Apr-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
I've done it about a dozen times, don't worry lol

[07-Apr-19 09:37 PM] phm87#7395
there were 2 or 3 , KSB at least but I won't mine with 2 GPU on these coins

[07-Apr-19 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
when a daemon crashes it can corrupt database (if the daemon is not shutdown properly/graccefully)

[07-Apr-19 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
explorer nodes also uses a native daemon from where it displays data

[07-Apr-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
I've never seen it crash a node, if that did indeed happen, I have some testing to do

[07-Apr-19 09:37 PM] phm87#7395
there was no crash on my side, maybe on the explorer side

[07-Apr-19 09:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe the explorer op just rebooted the server 😜

[07-Apr-19 09:38 PM] phm87#7395
I already had several coins crashing (out of kmd ecosystem : all wallets of the network of all forks of TZC crashed once per xx months, no explanation except that they forked TZC)

[07-Apr-19 09:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I hope that these tests and errors won't affect the definition of "top" and which AC are stable and unstable`
@phm87 I can assure you that whatever disruption you caused, there are several of us that did worse last year

[07-Apr-19 09:39 PM] SHossain#0007
if you find a bug, you can report here in discord. either in this channel or #dev-general 
best is to get the backtrace data if you can and the steps if the crash is re-producable

[07-Apr-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  I expect it at least ^^

[07-Apr-19 09:39 PM] phm87#7395
I told it in the KMD groups I was in (not yet in this discord)

[07-Apr-19 09:41 PM] phm87#7395
but from the point I told @metaphilibert  who said it is fine, I though that it was fine (or kind of) because making crash a blockexplorer is not an exploit

[07-Apr-19 09:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
@phm87 don't worry you didn't make the explorer explode lol

{Reactions}
💥 

[07-Apr-19 09:41 PM] phm87#7395
lol

[07-Apr-19 09:41 PM] Alright#0419
the ability to crash someone else's node on demand sure as fuck is an exploit

[07-Apr-19 09:41 PM] metaphilibert#0926
mining KSB is not a good idea with 0 block reward by the way 😉

[07-Apr-19 09:42 PM] phm87#7395
yeah, do not ask me for yiimp though

[07-Apr-19 09:42 PM] phm87#7395
one day, we'll have the discussion about nomp

[07-Apr-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
You found the reason why chains that don't expect to have much hashrate should use some % of POS

{Reactions}
✅ 

[07-Apr-19 09:42 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i was getting excited to test something new 😃

[07-Apr-19 09:42 PM] kolo#1111
Ok, we will count as expected, 1:1 plus 1:3. Website already ranked this way.

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] kolo#1111
I was wrong probably

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was wrong once

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] kolo#1111
All ACs

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it was not a fun day

{Reactions}
😂 

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] kolo#1111
Won’t affect result

[07-Apr-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
Could you explain what you mean by "But as I said I will try to leverage that by bounty for development and testing those"

[07-Apr-19 09:44 PM] kolo#1111
I will distribute bounties (legally delegated by KMD holders) by subjective measure

[07-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that time you thought you found a secp256k collision?

[07-Apr-19 09:44 PM] Ludom#5832
Could you set rules for the re-election 2020 one year before ?

[07-Apr-19 09:45 PM] kolo#1111
Yes, if we count all ACs hopefully it won’t change later also

[07-Apr-19 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright no, the time I thought I knew how dPoW worked and found out I wasn't even close to knowing wtf I was on about

[07-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Ludom#5832
Could you write it and annouce it clearly on the github already ?

[07-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
I'm still not sure what that means kolo

[07-Apr-19 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
bounties of VOTE?

[07-Apr-19 09:47 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 LABSTRE?

[07-Apr-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
huh?

[07-Apr-19 09:48 PM] Alright#0419
when I performed censorship attack on LABSTRE chain? This is when you realized you didn't know how dpow worked?

[07-Apr-19 09:48 PM] kolo#1111
@Alright yes. Large KMD holders get their votes and send them to me to reward good devs

[07-Apr-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No, I realized it when james told me I was wrong 😛

[07-Apr-19 09:51 PM] Ludom#5832

Good night ludom

[07-Apr-19 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
@kolo not sure it matters as there aren't two nodes too close to each other, but do you have a timestamp for when stats are definitive?

[07-Apr-19 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
just in case it does matter

[07-Apr-19 09:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  and in details what you were wrong about dpow ? I'm just curious

[07-Apr-19 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pretty much all of how signing works 😛

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Apr-19 09:59 PM] kolo#1111
That doesnt, so no one will speed up last moment) But wont affect result at all, anyway

[07-Apr-19 09:59 PM] kolo#1111
You should perform top all the time

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] kolo#1111
Doing dump needs more than second, couple of hours min

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
if they can speed up at the last moment, why shouldn't they be autoreelected?

[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] SHossain#0007
even with speed up stats will not change much. max a day score is about 500

[07-Apr-19 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
or even at 600 of total score each day

[07-Apr-19 10:01 PM] kolo#1111
@SHossain unless there is AC you can speed up

[07-Apr-19 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, it will need all the freq to go high as well for all AC

[07-Apr-19 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`unless there is AC you can speed up`
_thinks he knows a guy that can speed up most of the acs_

[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
if given a timestamp, I can script it. Yes it will take a while, but it's objective

[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
won't take more time than if I didn't have a timestamp

[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
even if the speed goes high there are other nodes who will participate as well

[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] kolo#1111
I would love to accept any corrections for the next elections, please be free to kick me any direction after this elections, not few days before current

[07-Apr-19 10:04 PM] kolo#1111
Or (actually anyway) I will disappoint others

[07-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Alright#0419
@SHossain will you continue to run your AR node in France?

{Reactions}
🤔 

[07-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
if so, I believe it should be 1/4 dev nodes

[07-Apr-19 10:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or is that still @kolo and @ca333's decision to make?

[07-Apr-19 10:07 PM] phm87#7395
1/4 ? a quarter of a dev node ?

[07-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
1 of 4 dev nodes as opposed to having a 5th dev node spot

[07-Apr-19 10:08 PM] phm87#7395
understood, thank you for the explanation

[07-Apr-19 10:09 PM] kolo#1111
We have 64 dev nodes 😃

[07-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Alright#0419
so no more region rules? 😃

[07-Apr-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:shexy:

[07-Apr-19 10:10 PM] kolo#1111
Only 4 are outside elections this year

[07-Apr-19 10:10 PM] kolo#1111
Others are still devs day by day, it's nn work

[07-Apr-19 10:11 PM] metaphilibert#0926
catching all the above discussion about elections rules
i agree with ludom, it is quite shady and it makes me sad to read 

-what numbers of node are automatically reelected and how many spots available? 
this point is very clear this year to mee, that's cool
-what is the limit to push your proposal? 
in practice before the activation of new set of notaries as we need a pubkey
but if we put a date, let's put a date, not a "you are encouraged to do it before that date"
-what metrics are taken into account for auto re-election? 
aah for this one the answers were quite frightening to me 
only BTC taken into account because no reliable stats for AC? We are daily watching komodostats and it is finally not the source of counting? 

Ok I am here for enough time to trust most of you but it is not very serious for newcomers in search of decentralized elections, or when you try to explain this great project to someone
i also know kolo is doing is best as election master 
now, these 3 points have be risen because not clear last year around the same moment (too late) and we already said that we should discuss about rules earlier in the year (and come one day to a more automated process)

So this year let’s make this workshop ! @Ludom

[07-Apr-19 10:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
now good luck to everyone, one metrics don't lie, number of VOTE2019 you will receive

[07-Apr-19 10:12 PM] metaphilibert#0926
euuuh until wich block / date?  :troll:

[07-Apr-19 10:12 PM] phm87#7395
I'd like to participate to this workshop (at least to witness this) if possible

[07-Apr-19 10:14 PM] kolo#1111
All are welcome to discuss on elections in between elections.

[07-Apr-19 10:14 PM] kolo#1111

[07-Apr-19 10:15 PM] SHossain#0007
yes @Alright. it will move to AR

[07-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Alright#0419
Don't understand why it was ever in France to begin with

[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
well i understand that it was less convenient

[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] kolo#1111
it was swapped with @Decker to easify for both

[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
and yet he's still competing in AR

[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`All are welcome to discuss on elections in between elections.`
Since they don't start for another 7 days, that's why it's coming up now 🙂

[07-Apr-19 10:17 PM] kolo#1111
They started month ago. After hardfork in june any new rules or something assumed more fair than I did - is HIGHLY welcome

[07-Apr-19 10:17 PM] kolo#1111
Not when I cant change current rules

[07-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
is 0dev4_decker up for autoreelection in EU or AR?

[07-Apr-19 10:17 PM] kolo#1111
No

[07-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Alright#0419
neither?
