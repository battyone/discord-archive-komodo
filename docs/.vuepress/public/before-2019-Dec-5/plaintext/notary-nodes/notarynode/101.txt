But you don't need to make much more

[07-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
one topic I'd like clarity on is the metric for autoreelection. Can we trust komodostats.com stats for this?

[07-Apr-19 08:42 PM] Ludom#5832
Kolo asks for more informations but it's not technically needed

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Ludom#5832
As you see, there is a lot of thing that can be improved next election 2020

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Ludom#5832
And I'll definitelly propose a workshop on that during the Komodo meetup

[07-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Ludom#5832
For 2019, good luck everyone

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
stats scripts are public

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
yea, didn't ask that the right way

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
I assume komodostats is open source

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
nope

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
don tt think so

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
Ok, please point me to these scripts

[07-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
but personally I have last year scripts

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
that do all things auto

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
and someone please clarify the exact metric for rankings

don t even remember the repo I put em

@SHossain You LOL, but what's to stop someone from doing an independent social media blitz campaign and getting earned votes while saying "meh I don't want to do a readme"?

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
BTC notarizations counts the same as ac and 3rd party?

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
no worry

[07-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh for notarizations ?

[07-Apr-19 08:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess the scoring is
1x BTC Notarizarion = 1 Score
3x AC Notarization = 1 Score

[07-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
you guess? üòÖ

[07-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
what was done last year?

[07-Apr-19 08:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i believe

[07-Apr-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
AC have less weight than BTC

[07-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
is it 1:3?

scoring explained üòÉ

[07-Apr-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe with more coins the ratio should increase

[07-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
a discussion for next year's, changing it now might not be a great idea

[07-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
We went by 1:3 last year though, yes?

[07-Apr-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@kolo

[07-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
Also, the timestamp for when it should be calculated?

[07-Apr-19 09:09 PM] kolo#1111
We can‚Äôt count AC notarizations this year due to untrustable nature on most current ac notarizations amounts, also we didn‚Äôt count last year and can‚Äôt change this. But for test this year I will count most trustable ACs to distribute bonus (which is planned to be very big!)

[07-Apr-19 09:10 PM] kolo#1111
AC s that developed to be stable by now - will be counted next year

[07-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
what is trustable and what is untrustable

[07-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
and why?

[07-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Ludom#5832
Good question üòÉ

[07-Apr-19 09:12 PM] kolo#1111
ACs had too much bugs during year, which made some nodes not equal in dpowing possibility

[07-Apr-19 09:13 PM] kolo#1111
Different branches, forks etc. I‚Äôm sure it will be totally unfair to count them

[07-Apr-19 09:13 PM] kolo#1111
But as I said I will try to leverage that by bounty for development and testing those

[07-Apr-19 09:13 PM] Ludom#5832
By bounty ?

[07-Apr-19 09:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
1 question since you're here  @kolo

[07-Apr-19 09:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
is this the official testnet?

@Alright assets which are stable now - objective metric for next year

[07-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Ludom#5832
And we need an election protocole for 2020

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] kolo#1111
All but OOT which had bug recently I think

`What defines stable`
How bored I get? :troll:

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
What was the issue with OOT?

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
so it's simply 1:3 excluding OOT?

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] kolo#1111
Urgent update few days ago

[07-Apr-19 09:16 PM] kolo#1111
Proportions are subject to discussion

[07-Apr-19 09:17 PM] kolo#1111
This year only KMD will be fair, since only those were announced before

[07-Apr-19 09:17 PM] Alright#0419
discussion between who?

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
This all seems way too subjective for my liking

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] kolo#1111
Everyone

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
Ok, I want the one that gets a-team reelected

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Alright#0419
see the problem here?

[07-Apr-19 09:18 PM] kolo#1111
Notarization counts are objective

[07-Apr-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
*objective-ish

[07-Apr-19 09:19 PM] kolo#1111
Assume all ACs that exist by now and which won‚Äôt have bugs (e.g. when only some nodes dPoW them while fixing something) count next year re-election

[07-Apr-19 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
ok, let me figure out which chains are "stable" so a-team gets reelected

[07-Apr-19 09:21 PM] kolo#1111
Just do it between elections and we‚Äôd figure out most fair method

[07-Apr-19 09:22 PM] kolo#1111
@mrlynch testnet is testnet, it‚Äôs useful whoever runs it

[07-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
I'm confused. Are the proportions for determining who is auto-reelected this year still up for discussion?

[07-Apr-19 09:23 PM] kolo#1111
Nope

[07-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Alright#0419
ok, what are they

[07-Apr-19 09:24 PM] Ludom#5832

[07-Apr-19 09:24 PM] kolo#1111
Number of KMD/btc notarizations

[07-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
AC notarizations needs to be part of it too?

[07-Apr-19 09:25 PM] kolo#1111
Not when not announced which prior to elections

[07-Apr-19 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
probably wont change the outcome that much, but just count all AC notarizations

[07-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Ludom#5832
It's ok for  me to just take KMD/BTC notarization

[07-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Ludom#5832
:troll:

[07-Apr-19 09:25 PM] kolo#1111
@jl777c it will

[07-Apr-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the more notarizations the better, with BTC notarizations weighted more

[07-Apr-19 09:26 PM] kolo#1111
Specially with ACs which were notarized before putting on all notaries

[07-Apr-19 09:27 PM] Ludom#5832
It's funny to have a discussion right now about the rule of reelection

{Reactions}
üò± 

[07-Apr-19 09:27 PM] kolo#1111
We did not changed any rules since last year I assume

[07-Apr-19 09:27 PM] Ludom#5832
What was the rules last year ?

[07-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Ludom#5832
How this year we have 7 notary nodes per area re-elected

[07-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Ludom#5832
And last year, we elected 5 NN in NA area

[07-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Ludom#5832
7NN in EU area

[07-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Ludom#5832
9 NN in AR area

[07-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Ludom#5832
9 NN in SH area

[07-Apr-19 09:30 PM] Ludom#5832
The rule this year is not the same. That's for sure

[07-Apr-19 09:30 PM] phm87#7395
https://komodoelection.com/1-about/komodo-elections/
```Every year, the Komodo community holds an election to choose who will operate notary nodes.

- The 28 best-performing notary node operators are automatically re-elected.
 - Performance is measured according to the number of completed notarizations
 - The top 7 nodes from each of the four regions are re-elected
- The other 32 positions are opened up and the community elects new operators.
- Anyone can run in the election. You don‚Äôt need to own any KMD or be on the team.
- VOTE tokens are airdropped to KMD holders at a 1:1 ratio.
- Community members simply send VOTE tokens to their preferred candidate(s).
- At the end of the voting period, the top 8 addresses with most VOTE tokens within each four regions win. Thus, in total, 32 new operators are elected.```

yes but I though these rules would be applied to know how many NN will be elected in 2019
