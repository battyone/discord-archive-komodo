it is not needed into komodo/src I think

[15-Apr-19 04:29 PM] phm87#7395
I agree with Genie

[15-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
tried running ./assetchains

[15-Apr-19 04:29 PM] phm87#7395
why ?

[15-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
"Import private key into assetchains
Import your KMD/BTCD WIF into all assetchains

cd ~
cd komodo/src
./assetchains
# wait for the blockchain to fully, will take a long time
./fiat-cli importprivkey BTCDwif"

[15-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
asked command to import priv keys but didnt see straight answer so went looking

[15-Apr-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
as we have 3 AC, I prefer to import key manually to learn

[15-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
found this

[15-Apr-19 04:30 PM] phm87#7395
``komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER importprivkey MySecretPrivKey``

[15-Apr-19 04:31 PM] phm87#7395
I have no clues if ./assetchains is configured properly

[15-Apr-19 04:31 PM] gt#2812
that will start many chains

I wouldn't mind not to see a balance, as long as iguana does.. *mais alors c'est dommage* : `error signing raw KMD utxoduplicates tx`

[15-Apr-19 04:31 PM] phm87#7395
@gt  thanks, I didn't know that 2019NN testnet had such scripts

[15-Apr-19 04:33 PM] gt#2812
from the /src folder i mean

[15-Apr-19 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok

@phm87 in answer to what you asked me
||search box works well||

[15-Apr-19 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
priv key imported to all 3 assets

[15-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
now need to fund I believe

[15-Apr-19 04:34 PM] phm87#7395
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  yes thank you (I asked you because you may know if it has already been developed)

[15-Apr-19 04:34 PM] phm87#7395
@Dr.Terminus  yes for KMD you'll need to buy some and I think that there is a faucet for BEER and PIZZA

[15-Apr-19 04:35 PM] phm87#7395
for TXSCLCC  you can mine it using 1 CPU thread, you'll get block in few minutes

[15-Apr-19 04:35 PM] phm87#7395
to start mining TXS... : ``komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true 1``

[15-Apr-19 04:35 PM] phm87#7395
to stop mining : ``komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate false``

[15-Apr-19 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
if you put 1 KMD that's enough on the KMD node (way too much to be precise)

[15-Apr-19 04:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok

[15-Apr-19 04:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'Create a file named pubkey.txt at ~/2019NNtestnet/iguana/pubkey.txt. Contents should be

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
WIF is your private key

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
these textfiles should be created on my fork then new pull request made?

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
no no no

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
do not put on github your private key

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
figured

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
you should put these files on your server

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
guide sorta reads that way though

[15-Apr-19 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
no guide is perfect but I'm happy because there is a guide ^^

[15-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Me too.. lost enough as it is 😃

[15-Apr-19 04:38 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

command to output asset coin addresses ? or is it all the same KMD address ?

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
if one of the faucet doesn't work, some guys may have too much BEER or PIZZA

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
I can send you some TXSCLCC  if you are not able to mine it

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the pubkey.txt file

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
pubkey=xxxxxxx

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
just like that inside ?

k

[15-Apr-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
Commands are the same for KMD and AC but to talk to an AC you'll need to use ac_name:
``komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC  get info``

[15-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
gonne try to send some beer to kmd address

[15-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not to pubkey right ?

[15-Apr-19 04:43 PM] phm87#7395
no to KMD addy

[15-Apr-19 04:43 PM] phm87#7395
KMD addy that is the same for each AC because you imported the privatekey

[15-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yep

[15-Apr-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
@Dr.Terminus  if you mine some TXSCLCC (there is no faucet), you'll need to move the funds before being able to split the coins

[15-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
output of this address showed after privkey import

[15-Apr-19 04:44 PM] phm87#7395
good

[15-Apr-19 04:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how much beer enough ? too much?

[15-Apr-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
so when you will have milked the faucet of BEER and PIZZA, you will still need to have some TXSCLCC (I posted the commands here above) but you'll need to move these funds before being able to split these coins.

[15-Apr-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
1 or 2 BEER is enough

[15-Apr-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I stole this from medium atricle:
```
1. Private key
A private key is essentially a randomly generated, 32-byte number.

2. Public key
A public key can be derived from the private key using what’s called Elliptic Curve Cryptography. 

3. Public address
Public key → 8-step process involving concatenation, hash functions (SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160), and Base58Check → public address```

[15-Apr-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
thank you CG

[15-Apr-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
explanation of the trick about TXSCLCC  : it is not possible to split coins that were mined (coinbase coins). You need to move these coins then it is possible to split them

[15-Apr-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it depends on *how* you split them

[15-Apr-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
yes I'm not an expert but using the iguana autosplit script (with default settings), I was not able to split coinbase coins

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
maybe a simple parameter should be added somewhere

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Alright#0419
that's not a technical limitation, just a limitation in that splitter

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
I didn't know

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC getbalance

` 😛

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
..

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok I have not started mining TXSCLCC yet..

[15-Apr-19 04:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
should i or should i opt to have it sent ?

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
thank you to enhance my KMD general culture @Alright  and @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
splitting sounds.. tricky maybe ?

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u let it split coinbase it will runaway split kmd

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its there for a reason

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
what do you mean by runaway ?

[15-Apr-19 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
if you have any idea what you're doing, you should not be using auto-split

[15-Apr-19 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
it's there as default behavior so lazy nodes continue to notarize if not maintained

[15-Apr-19 04:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Keep splitting higher than your target

[15-Apr-19 04:50 PM] phm87#7395
i'll explain the manual split after he got some coins of each AC and KMD

Rule #1 of splitting with raws:
unless shielding is required on CoinX, if you can't split it with raws then you don't hold the signing key for it

[15-Apr-19 04:51 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  several guys asked me how to do the NN testnet in private messages but I prefer to discuss in public (then other ppl can correct me if I say bullshit)

[15-Apr-19 04:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Rule #2  of splitting with raws:
raws are our friend
