Afaik yes. Its a method or burning coins.

en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN

[24-Dec-18 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 @CHMEX both are the same OP_RETURN

[24-Dec-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
OP_RETURN is a special bitcoin script opcode that says "the rest of this script is just data, do not store it in the utxo database", which every node must store in memory

[24-Dec-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
this service records things in OP_RETURN, very similar to how dpow uses OP_RETURN: https://opentimestamps.org/

OpenTimestamps: a timestamping proof standard
OpenTimestamps aims to be a standard format for blockchain timestamping. The format is flexible enough to be vendor and blockchain independent.

[24-Dec-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
in the days before OP_RETURN, people stored data as actual utxo vin/vouts

[24-Dec-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as, the original Satoshi whitepaper PDF is stored directly as a multisig transaction(!)

[24-Dec-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
that bloats the utxo DB for the rest of time on every node

[24-Dec-18 05:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
hence why btc core is so against storing rando data as utxos, OP_RETURN allows rando data to not pollute utxo DB

[24-Dec-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
opreturn script returns failed

[24-Dec-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so any attempt to spend it will fail

[24-Dec-18 08:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 by definition, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable (unspendable), and do not need to be stored in the utxo database. That is what he is trying to say, I think

[24-Dec-18 10:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Op return usually have zero value, so being unspendable does not matter

[24-Dec-18 10:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think u can attach value to them to burn coins

[24-Dec-18 10:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That was how labs was going to launch its cluster chains. Op returnn with chain params, burning the ac_supply

[24-Dec-18 10:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if that is still the plan

[27-Dec-18 11:24 PM] smellycouch#3071
quick question, why to addresses involved in notarization and 0.0001  UTXOs often have negative balances?

@smellycouch fairly sure it's an explorer bug

[27-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Alright#0419

@Alright   thx

[28-Dec-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notary nodes would break anything that tried to log their transactions ... when the local wallet itself cant go a couple of days witout totally bogging down and breaking, an explorer could hope for at best a few weeks before having corrupted data.

[28-Dec-18 01:41 AM] smellycouch#3071
@blackjok3r  is that because of the number of transactions, or some other factor?      I'm interested.   that address above is at 1.2 million transactions.   Many systems need to handle that much per second, with near zero tolerance for error.   I do hope to see KMD itself handle that any transactions per second someday

[28-Dec-18 01:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a database issue, not the actual blockchain itself... the blockchain is accurate but when you try to keep track of the tranacions in some place (like the BTC wallet code, or the insight DB's (for explorers) It just doesnt work ... I figured out ways to "fix" it on the BTC wallet code side... where the node lives inside a "bubble" of 1000 blocks, and does not save its tranasacion history from before that time. This has 100% fixed any problem notary node has of bogging down, btu its a very specific fix and definatly cannot apply to all nodes. I think possibly a mining pool node's wallet could also use this method. Exchanges though, not very sure.

[28-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If some use was using a blockchain for millions of transacions, I think they would need to deploy thier own entrie DB code and infristrucure to support that.

[28-Dec-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No mean feat ... I looked at the BTC wallet code for about 3-4 days, to wrap my head around what would be required to replace it before deciding that it basically cant be done.

[28-Dec-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Decided on hacking workarounds into it instead. As unless your really pushing it to do what it was never designed ot do it does a perfecty fine job.

[28-Dec-18 01:52 AM] smellycouch#3071
@blackjok3r   thank you, very interesting.        I will save myself the 3-4 days then üòÉ      I'm surprised a DB can't handle it, but glad it's an external issue

[28-Dec-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah not really sure why or how it ends up corrupted, this is pretty rare but a rescan on a wallet with millions of transactions takes an extreme amount of time.

[28-Dec-18 01:55 AM] smellycouch#3071
that it does üòâ  üçø

[29-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Mylo#8306
i think it's something to do with moving wallet.dat files between block reward maturity.   just a guess.   the active wallet.dat on the notary nodes sometimes rescan from a particular height _after_ their block reward matures.

reason i think it's related to this is the pioneers NN wallet was -50 to -100KMD for a while.  side note, a rollover wallet sometimes tops up the NN wallet to do notarizations.  When these mature block rewards are accounted for but not spendable because they don't have `nLockTime` set.   <--- too low level for me to hand-on-heart say i'm an expert on behaviour without someone blessing my assumption with "yes you are correct mylo" or "derrr mylo, you are so wrong" üòÑ

You can't use iguana mainnet until you are elected and your pubkey exists is in Komodo source.

@SHossain  oh I'm not doing that, no.   no KMD mainnet for me.

[03-Jan-19 05:07 AM] smellycouch#3071
at least at this moment.   just realized I should be in #kmdlabs

[04-Jan-19 01:04 AM] Mylo#8306
3 years sys admin experience or equivalent (telco background is handy because of real time comms nature of systems)
compiling stubborn code
git workflow
fault troubleshooting
on-call
full node experience
scripting ability
like matrix style code & logs drifting up a screen
competitive
humble

#kmdlabs gives all of that.   1 month there is like 1 year of sys admin work, maybe more depending how many chains requiring troubleshooting for what they are doing.

@dukeleto why is git clean less optimal?

[08-Jan-19 11:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
Isn't that the exact point of git clean?

[08-Jan-19 11:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
To get the repo in a clean state for doing a fresh build

[08-Jan-19 11:58 PM] SHossain#0007
best thing for me is `git reset --hard`. works all the time

[09-Jan-19 12:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
`git clean` is like `git reset --hard` but nukes everything. 
`git reset --hard` can leave some bits behind like build artifacts

[09-Jan-19 12:02 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, and my own files

[09-Jan-19 12:03 AM] SHossain#0007
for removing old builds i use `make clean`

[09-Jan-19 12:03 AM] SHossain#0007
basically, i use these everyday

[09-Jan-19 01:45 AM] Mylo#8306
thx `git reset --hard` sounds like something i shd use more, cheers

[09-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@lukechilds it can lose data accidentally, mostly

[09-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
the "less optimal" is that it can do what you want, but you *might* lose data, depending on the state of your tree

[09-Jan-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
build.sh X 3 cannot lose your data

[09-Jan-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain i have this shell alias for like 10+ years: ```
$ type undo
undo is aliased to `git reset HEAD^'
```

[09-Jan-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
not --hard tho, because that can lose data. Don't make it easy to accidentally lose data, is very core git philosophy

[09-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
so Git folks veer towards the solution that has least risk of losing data, if multiple choices exist to do the same thing

[09-Jan-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
`undo` is great for "oh, i didn't want that commit message, let's do that again"
