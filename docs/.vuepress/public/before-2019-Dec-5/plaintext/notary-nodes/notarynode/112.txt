_was against it last year too (and he wasn't even running then)_

[10-Apr-19 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
we can do more to minimize fud sources imo

[10-Apr-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
and i don't think rewarding voters is such a big source of fud

[10-Apr-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
political parties promise voters stuff too right? indirectly money too

[10-Apr-19 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if you want to reward voters, then there's no problem as long as you collect enough votes`
How's it any different than straight out saying: "Give me 1 million votes and I'll give you $20k worth of KMD"?

[10-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
whether or not political parties actually do it is another question lol

[10-Apr-19 05:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i see where our disclosure gets confusing in the proposal

[10-Apr-19 05:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```We thank our voters for the confidence in Chainmakers, which resulted North America Address
in 2 notary spots in season 2. As keeping a notary automatically
re-elected for the next season falls on the shoulders of us, Chainmakers,
we will not be airdropping any mining rewards from the automatically
re-elected notary nodes this coming season.```

[10-Apr-19 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
an "indirect service" is wholly different than "I'll give you x$ for every vote"

[10-Apr-19 05:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that last part should read as: "we will not be airdropping any mining rewards from the automatically re-elected notary node or the one running for elections this year"

[10-Apr-19 05:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This was written when we were still not sure if both nodes got automatically re-elected or not.

[10-Apr-19 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
yes, so chainmakers is bribe-free. yay

[10-Apr-19 05:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But i think we can state that we WONT DISTRIBUTE MINING REWARDS TO VOTERS

[10-Apr-19 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
just submit a PR with those words and that should make it crystal-clear

[10-Apr-19 05:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So @CHMEX please, edit the list for us.

[10-Apr-19 05:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, will do.

[10-Apr-19 05:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In Puerto Rico we say: "lo que es igual no es ventaja"

[10-Apr-19 05:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"what is the same is not an advantage"

[10-Apr-19 05:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So if everyone was allowed back in past elections to do it, not doing it would have been political suicide

[10-Apr-19 05:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the same way now with the prohibition.

[10-Apr-19 05:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Has anyone come across this error before ```2019-04-10 17:31:46 ERROR: CScriptCheck(): 11f878452ba67473d4e8ac0b512d4dffd1d13ce84a7d0f4a73 39a115de0efe88:0 VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a f alse/empty top stack element```

[10-Apr-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka usually a UTXO issue

[10-Apr-19 05:34 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have a single UTXO :S

[10-Apr-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why 😛

[10-Apr-19 05:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Does this indicate it failed the tx?

[10-Apr-19 05:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ahh, right, well, its similat to a prohibition since the organizer of the election is actively stating that people distributing rewards should not be voted for.

[10-Apr-19 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@NutellaLicka it has to be a spilt UTXO of 0.0001 or it will not go

[10-Apr-19 05:36 PM] Lumbi#8378
bribes on the notary level, is not just in bad taste, it's retrograde macro-economics. the value of a notary is impartiality.

[10-Apr-19 05:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which is ok, since we decided to not distribute more on second season when we noticed that rewards barely paid for the servers at the low prices.

😃 thanks! 😃

All I know for sure is that if I get elected, I can sleep soundly in knowing that the overwhelming majority of my votes are on merit
Everyone else must use their own measuring device...

I hadn't really thought about it until now, but I suppose yes it could be considered "bribing". I'm doing this to learn more about how cryptocurrencies work and trying to promote Komodo in the UK - crypto in general isn't big here, and trying to persuade people it isn't just another form of gambling is an uphill struggle.

[10-Apr-19 05:44 PM] newvulcan#4719
Having a notary node would give me something "physical" to show and say "Look this is what its all about"

[10-Apr-19 05:46 PM] Greer#0666
If Voskcoin gets elected, I fear that I'll never sleep again...

[10-Apr-19 05:47 PM] newvulcan#4719
Just an aside but f*** me, is that a real rise in Pirate ?! 78% increase. Huge rise in volume in the past hour - wonder what sparked that

_wonders if vosk will get the "he's an influencer and can bring people to KMD" vote_

[10-Apr-19 05:50 PM] Greer#0666
it didnt' work last year 😄

[10-Apr-19 05:50 PM] jorian#4555
that is an important vote, though

[10-Apr-19 05:50 PM] newvulcan#4719
@webworker01 oh I dunno though 😉

[10-Apr-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jorian I don't disagree, it's part of the reason he's in my "maybe" list (not that my little spread matters much 😛 )

nuke energy is green, coal, not so much

Also @newvulcan I'm sorry that PR slipped my mind. I'll merge it tomorrow ~3pm UTC

[10-Apr-19 08:41 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Alright I had a similar experience when cleaning my wallet after I sent funds to it again

[10-Apr-19 08:41 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
after importing it with the `"" false` params

[10-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
3rd time this has happened now, just wondering why it happens

[10-Apr-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
I can script it to fix itself, but I'd rather understand why it happens in the first place

[10-Apr-19 08:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was able to split the funds after that

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
hahaha @Alright

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
exactly what happens to me with verus for no reason :p

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
weird thing is that I'm able to use sendtoaddress

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
without UTXOS

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
but the txes don't seem to propagate properly?

broken listunspent

[10-Apr-19 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000

am used to resync verus...

[10-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I pinged mike a while ago, and he told me to resync

[10-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
technically it was impossible

[10-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
not sure it's the same problem

[10-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
my node just flat out cannot propagate txs to mempool it seems

[10-Apr-19 09:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
When I had that error I was able to sendtoaddress and then the unspents reappeared

[10-Apr-19 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem to be the same thing

[10-Apr-19 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright are you using the daemon with the walletfilter?

[10-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
I did at one point, but it wasn't running when this happened

[10-Apr-19 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't know about the "regular" one, but I'm using the 1st filter version and I've noticed that it will not split beer if it's the only UTXO left

[10-Apr-19 09:25 PM] newvulcan#4719
@Alright - No Probs 😃 Thanks

[10-Apr-19 09:28 PM] crumb#2550
what is the VOTE2019 token snapshot block or UTC timecode, whichever is more appropriate in this case?

[10-Apr-19 09:29 PM] crumb#2550
the available info just says 14th of april

[10-Apr-19 09:29 PM] crumb#2550
lots of timezones to take into account 😄

[10-Apr-19 11:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Can someone with some time to spare walk @Lumbi  through setting up his node
_is in the middle of 🍽 and he really needs assistance_
