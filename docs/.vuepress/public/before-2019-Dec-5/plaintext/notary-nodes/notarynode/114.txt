I am on an older comit of my iguana still btw, the one at the lates commit is not as good... but I have to stick with it on a-team to see how long it alsts before it stops (if it stops) few theories on why that happens but it take 8 days to get into the broken state... 😦

``const int MAX_INBOUND_FROMIP = 5;``
Is it good for notarization rate to increase this constant ?

[11-Apr-19 04:17 PM] zatJUM#9924
Couldn't we just do ```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"51.89.152.133\"}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"addnotary\",\"ipaddr\":\"51.89.148.138\"}"```?

[11-Apr-19 04:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no, because there are new nodes which were added to testnet.json

[11-Apr-19 04:20 PM] zatJUM#9924
Isn't that command made for that?

[11-Apr-19 04:23 PM] gt#2812
we need to add pubkeys

[11-Apr-19 04:23 PM] gt#2812
which needs a restart

[11-Apr-19 04:24 PM] zatJUM#9924
And why sometimes we just need the iguana call? When someone just change its IP?

only if you want to let each node connect to you a gajillion times and have them flood you with a single sendmsg

lol, your donkey is a good donkey ^^
I work at about 120 km from home : 3h20 to 4h of travel per day to go to work and come back. But I'm addicted to the train (you can discuss with girls or use the laptop while you cannot do anything in the car). I own a car but I feel more free in the train

[11-Apr-19 04:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
120 km ? Is it Lyon - Grenoble by any chance ? 😃

[11-Apr-19 04:46 PM] phm87#7395
no, it is Liège - Bruxelles

[11-Apr-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
but before, I went to Luxembourg and the 200 km travel from Liège to Luxembourg (and 200km to come back) was too difficult (then I took a flat)

you can, but since stats is only pulling the name, the rest is meaningless unless you actively do something else with it besides stats

[11-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Greer#0666
just wanting to move it out of the command to start the daemon, so I can start with `komodod -ac_name=PIZZA` and everything else tucked away into that conf.

[11-Apr-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`komodod -ac_name=PIZZA` without params will give you a different chain

[11-Apr-19 05:27 PM] Greer#0666
thats what I was asking, wanted to put the rest in .komodo/PIZZA/PIZZA.conf.   Cant do that?

[11-Apr-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, you cannot do that

[11-Apr-19 05:28 PM] Greer#0666
alrighty then

[11-Apr-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought you meant the json conf that we're using for stats; sry for the confusion

[11-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Greer#0666
np, I realize I just spilled a though from my head without being clear

[11-Apr-19 05:29 PM] Greer#0666
your handy BeNN has sleeps between starting the coin daemons, why are those needed?

[11-Apr-19 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I add the longer sleeps because of how long KMD takes to load and the shorter ones in case used on lessor CPUs

[11-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Greer#0666
ah, ok.  tks

This list could be broken down into regions

I'm but mere pixels on your screen, no need for such formal titles

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I assume some candidates have no need to run after being automatically in

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe somebody can make a per region list of candidates that need to run

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Some candidates assumed they were automatically in and are running for another node too

[11-Apr-19 06:32 PM] kolo#1111
It's possible, but non official, since it can miss someone

[11-Apr-19 06:33 PM] kolo#1111
but all need to update their page to include updated facts

[11-Apr-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking people will need to see a list to choose from for each region and it shouldnt have candidates that are not eligibile (for whatever reason including already being elected)

[11-Apr-19 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
didn't someone do that last year, or was that part of the agama voting process?
