@Alright and?

[17-Apr-19 02:51 AM] VoskCoin#1869
also to prove you're wrong, I showed up late 2018 in regards to pirate

[17-Apr-19 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`frankly many of the bash scripts are over complicated mess`
so don't 😭 and "uncomplicate them" 🤷🏽

[17-Apr-19 02:52 AM] VoskCoin#1869
this is my full-time job, not a hobby -- not sure what you dont understand about that @Alright

[17-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Alright#0419
@Greer run for elections yourself.

` @Greer will take care of the node,`
the same @Greer who's saying it's too hard to manage with 3 chains?

[17-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Greer#0666
CG, I've spent the last two weeks using that search box.  what you guys dont see is that you're taking a lot of information for granted.  There's a reason the few that came from the kmdlabs did so well.

`There's a reason the few that came from the kmdlabs did so well.`
And we've posted 100% of what we did and learned there in this channel

[17-Apr-19 02:54 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@Deleted User hey its worth a shot 😄 lol

[17-Apr-19 02:54 AM] Alright#0419
How much will it cost to get #kmdlabs promoted @VoskCoin ?

[17-Apr-19 02:54 AM] Alright#0419
what about #mgnx ?

[17-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Greer#0666
when did I say that its hard to manage three chains?  I run Bitcoin, Lightning, two ethereum nodes (geth and parity) and a zen secure node on my own hardware with little effort.

[17-Apr-19 02:55 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@Alright just your private keys 😄

[17-Apr-19 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there is no reason to be disrespectful`
No? I'm sitting here busting my ass 18 hrs a day, literally saying and posting all the "secrets" and he's going to get elected on your fame and he can't handle 1/20th of the job?

[17-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
You'll promote MGNX for my MGNX private keys?

[17-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Greer#0666
what I find hard is understanding how the notorizing works, this is unique to kmd and pretty much undocumented

[17-Apr-19 02:56 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 are you saying you wanted to partner up 😮

[17-Apr-19 02:56 AM] VoskCoin#1869
i'm pretty sure @Alright wants to work with me

[17-Apr-19 02:57 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, promote MGNX, and I'll give you 5% of it's supply

[17-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Greer#0666
I've been trying to clean up the mess I've found in this channel and get it running in a managed way using some best practices, without letting my stats drop too far on the testnet leaderboard.

[17-Apr-19 02:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`are you saying you wanted to partner up`
No, I'm saying that if you're not going to do the job then he should campaign on his own merit (or his admitted lack thereof) and he shouldn't get elected just because people know your name and think they are giving you the job

[17-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Alright#0419
@Greer run for your own node.

[17-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Greer#0666
it turns out that autosplitting utxo's isn't autosplitting via iguana at all, its manually splitting them, which is fine, but undocumented.

[17-Apr-19 02:59 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that was a lighthearted comment

[17-Apr-19 02:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it turns out that autosplitting utxo's isn't autosplitting via iguana at all`
and that's been posted in here 20 times

Speaking as one of those who came here from LABs, I've spent more hours learning outside my day job than I did in my day job.  I've only recently joined the KMD team, before that it was months of curiousity, reading, testing, poking etc which got me here

[17-Apr-19 02:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've also posted just about every script I'm using, many of them variations on scripts by others.

[17-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Greer#0666
sure and now I know whats what, some of what I read before makes sense.  but this is not documentation and hindsight shouldn't be a requirement

[17-Apr-19 03:01 AM] Greer#0666
its not just Vosk and I either, Voskcoin has a large community including many developers, available to help.

@VoskCoin your only reason to do it is based on what you make rather than technical metric?

[17-Apr-19 03:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User It's not about "deciding"
It's about he's literally bitching that a job that's being handed to him is to hard when he's been spoon-fed everything he needs to do it. And it pisses me off that we work hard for our skill and someone incompetent is likely to get the job and someone competent will get knocked out if he gets it

[17-Apr-19 03:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
LABs has been a great learing environment, and I appreciate all the info I gained from spending my free time there.

[17-Apr-19 03:03 AM] Greer#0666
one of the most active members has more apps on the ledger than any other dev and has code in the linux kernel.  NN operators shouldn't' need to be devs though, sysadmins a different skillset entirely.

[17-Apr-19 03:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I honestly support the idea that it acts as a prospective NN bootcamp

[17-Apr-19 03:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There are at least 9 competent people running in EU

[17-Apr-19 03:04 AM] VoskCoin#1869

if he is elected and does regular content, if only to pimp his kmd bags, we all win

Greer is an awesome guy, he wont just ditch anything because some random guy on the internet says to lol

[17-Apr-19 03:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User Look at the EU candidates and seriously tell me that you think someone that thinks that 3 chains is too "secret" should get a spot there just because someone else is youtube "famous"

[17-Apr-19 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
Year round, yes

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you liked my stuff when I was talking about :pirate:

Looking at the  #notary-node-alarms  I see a few that didnt make it though winter, havent notarised in months or made any contributions to code etc... but are still mining. Then there are the others, like @blackjok3r  who despite having a node located in a disadvantaged area has made massive contributions, learning on the way.

[17-Apr-19 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@VoskCoin yes I did, but at that time you weren't about to take away a competent NN and put someone that thinks being spoon-fed is to difficult in their place

[17-Apr-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I;m very happy there are people like genie here helping everyone. If I was doing this alone for all the people I wouldnt be able to get any work done 😃

do you think KMD should invest in marketing or solely dev work?

`CG is just doing his thing to compete`
Actually, I'm not; I'm not even running in EU

[17-Apr-19 03:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CG is just doing his thing to announce that he wants NNs that are capable of being NNs

[17-Apr-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Last year we had no help think of basically everyone being Dr Terminus (no offence man)

[17-Apr-19 03:11 AM] Greer#0666
so what makes you think I'm less competent than anyone else here?  You dont know anything about me or what I know because I don't let on what I do/do not know here.  Only with regard to kmd notorization which is a new concept for anyone coming in.

[17-Apr-19 03:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
regardless of what the skillset - promo, dev, sysops, writing docs... all are contributions... but consistent commintment and contribution is critical, as is being able to run a node and hang around for the duration of elected term.

[17-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I do like lots of good documentation myself

[17-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Greer#0666
iguana, specifically

[17-Apr-19 03:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what about it?

[17-Apr-19 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana documentation is its code... I think its liek that for a reason.... so that we are forced to improve it

[17-Apr-19 03:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as a whole, iguana is 15 different things in 1 codebase

[17-Apr-19 03:14 AM] Greer#0666
ok, well there's something that could be documented

[17-Apr-19 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everything I use is also on git.

[17-Apr-19 03:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure you noticed, but code changes fast here. docs can be a challenge, but there no stopping anyone from writing more.

[17-Apr-19 03:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Plus I made custom RPCs for the daemon which I pestered james for months to be merged that make your lives very easy. 😃

[17-Apr-19 03:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Doesn't mean that I dont have intimate knowledge of linux and server security.`
Then how do you not understand basic shell scripts?

[17-Apr-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
documentation is discord... just hope ppl listen  and relayt this information 😉 One of the best reason ofor LABS was I was able to pass on most of my knowledge to a bunch of people at once. These people can then teach others. etc...

[17-Apr-19 03:20 AM] Greer#0666
I understand bash scripts very well

[17-Apr-19 03:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm speaking in general, as a bloke who spent time learning with what was available, and adding where I could.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 getting elected and simply getting a node up are different things -- unsure why you wouldn't want elaborate & complete guides associated with the project you're investing your time and resources in

[17-Apr-19 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If your talking about utxo management.... You can do it all in bash and not use iguana at all check webworkers repo. 😄

[17-Apr-19 03:21 AM] VoskCoin#1869
if I followed your logic, my youtube channel would be worthless

[17-Apr-19 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How can you have an eleborate and complete guide for a notaty node when there are at least 10 ways of doing it?

[17-Apr-19 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`unsure why you wouldn't want elaborate & complete guides associated with the project you're investing your time and resources in`
Then spend less time on youtube and write one up, we all know you're good with words and explaining shit 🤷🏽

[17-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Greer#0666
Along the way I have not understood why I am bash scripting some of the things that have been scripted and would have preferred to understand the why so that I could my my own scripts instead of have to try to figure out what is happening by follwing a trail of scripts that run scripts that run python scripts

[17-Apr-19 03:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@VoskCoin I'm in favour of good docs. I've written more than a few, early on just because they werent available. My proposal has a percentage towards translation of docs into other languages.

[17-Apr-19 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Along the way I have not understood why I am bash scripting some of the things that have been scripted`
