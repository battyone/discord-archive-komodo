I have created notarynode-announce channel here. Please use that only for announcements. No chats allowed and will be deleted.

@SHossain do you know if there's a way to crank up notifications on a per channel basis on Discord?

[18-Jun-18 02:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
dm, found it

[18-Jun-18 02:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
just in normal notifications, scroll down and you can override for a specific channel

I saw there's a new #notary-node-alarms channel

[19-Jun-18 08:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
was that made in error as well as the announce channel?

[19-Jun-18 08:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is it for something else?

marcel.hodan improve connectivity to other nodes, do faster transaction sign

[20-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <marcel.hodan> 1. so add manually more nodes to our nodes
2. increase CPU power?

[20-Jun-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what is wrong with the notarization ration? it seems 90%+

[20-Jun-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <marcel.hodan> how did you calculate this ?
did you check for batman_sh and for batman_ar ?

[20-Jun-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <marcel.hodan> I checked https://notarystats.info/notarizationsbtc.php 60min ago and it said "last btc notariation for batman_sh = 1333min ago (around 20180619 mid day)"

I don't know if it's been asked here before. But could someone ELI5 what a notary node does on a day to day basis. I understand the importance of a notary node, and the fact they notarise KMD blockchain onto the BTC blockchain atm, but how do they actually go about this?

[21-Jun-18 09:12 AM] jorian#4555
actually, when the notaries are notarizing, there's not much 'work' to do, concerning the notaries. all we do is monitor the nodes and see if everything works ok

[21-Jun-18 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
apart from that, i think a lot of us are improving the ecosystem by helping out the community

[21-Jun-18 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
they see the rewards that the notary mining gives as a kind of salary for which some work needs to be done.

[21-Jun-18 09:14 AM] jorian#4555
at least, that's how i see it

[21-Jun-18 09:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Awesome, and your basic setup is accompanied by a lot of miners as well?

I see it totally differently. As stated during elections notaries job is to "notarize" : secure kmd and ecosystem by running programs that devs (and mostly jl777) release.
This can be seen as : buy / rent a node run program and it s done.
To me (at least) that doesn t mean there is nothing to do : process / tech is very young ( I think it s the 2nd election so far ). So it need very special attention : monitoring and be sure to have the best performance is time consuming : you have the choice being a notary to be proactive on it : monitor and check every single change in codebase : refresh and test asap, or just wait and do it when you have time for it.
Linking other activities like ecosystem development is not relevant, at least to me : your job as a notary is to protect the network and be very reactive. Developping side business is not a part of the deal : it helps the entire ecosystem but relation with notaries duty is in my mind a : 0.
What is related is everything and every process that can help refine adapt and make the notarizing system better, period : for example you have 2 huge contributors : @webworker01  that developped a wonderful interface to monitor every notary activity / performance : THIS is a way to optimize the notarization system because it shows publicly strenghts and weakness of any operator and it just hardens the competition to be on top stats : top stats job well done. Another high contributor ir for example @blackjok3r that just coordinate and develop scaling investing time like no other contributor.
A lot of other notary nodes operator participate on this and participate in the process. That s how the system and ecosystem is refined. That s how I see the notary "todo" list done.

[22-Jun-18 03:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
And just out of curiosity, is there any mining penalty for notary nodes with much lower notarisation rate (geographic handicap inclusive)?

[22-Jun-18 04:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cheers

[22-Jun-18 04:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are  all artiks nodes active? 
komodostats only lists his EU node. 
notarystats show recent mining activity on all 4, but 3 of those show no notarisations in the last 18 days

[22-Jun-18 04:18 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
expected to go back to notarising at some stage? If so, I'll leave them in. If not, there's only 61 nodes?

Instead of `./m_notary` run `./m_notary_testnest` maybe.  Your pubkey probably won‚Äôt be recognised until you submit for inclusion, but just installation and testnet run `BEER` and `PIZZA` assetchains in the `./assetchains` script when you get to that section.

Is a notary node like a master node? Do I need to lock up kmds?

[24-Jun-18 07:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No it is a set of nodes that notarizes the chain to btc

[24-Jun-18 07:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They are elected once a year

[24-Jun-18 07:33 AM] PHBA2061#2530
isn't it 6 months ? according  to the faq: "there are 64 nodes in total, 32 notary-node seats are up for election every 6 months, once elected a notary-node seat lasts for 12 months "

[24-Jun-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
wherever that is written it is wrong and self-contradictory. how can i tlast for 12 months but be up for reeletionevery 6?

[24-Jun-18 08:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@jl777c it's written here https://komodoplatform.com/faqs/#faq/can-you-tell-me-about-the-notary-node-elections it's written here, and actually it's not self-contradictory, if I understand it correctly, because only half of the total number (32 out of 64) got elected at each election, so a gap of 6 months between each election is possible (let's say in Jan 2018, 32 nodes were elected, then in June 2018 the next 32 nodes were elected, then in Jan 2019 we'll have a new election in order to replace the first 32 notary nodes, while the 2nd 32 nodes still have 6 months). But I'm not sure this is true with the actual situation or not ?
