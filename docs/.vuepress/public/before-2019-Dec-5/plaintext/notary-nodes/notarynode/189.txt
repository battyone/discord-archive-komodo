I'm getting a few now.

[04-May-19 11:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes

[04-May-19 11:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
i have a lock now for beer buut bestmatches is still 10

[04-May-19 11:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
@jl777c where's the port set for iguana?

[04-May-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
The last time I received many of those my node was basically out of commision for over a day.  Happened twice.

[04-May-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization file

[04-May-19 11:30 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@CrisF yeah , I think we're all seeing 00000, because consensus is not reached at the end of the round , because bestmatches stuck at 10

[04-May-19 11:31 AM] CrisF#3405
When I was getting before  other nodes seemed ok for that.

[04-May-19 11:31 AM] CrisF#3405
I believe others might have experienced the same

[04-May-19 11:32 AM] PHBA2061#2530
a locked utxo will always happen when nodes attempt to notarize, but if bestmatches can't reach 11, the nota won't happen and the utxo will be unlocked

[04-May-19 11:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't located notarization file.

[04-May-19 11:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
silly me, right at the top

[04-May-19 11:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
in testnet.json... port is the same.. thought maybe alright pulled another one on us but he didn't

[04-May-19 11:36 AM] CrisF#3405
SHould we consider changing the port?

[04-May-19 11:38 AM] PHBA2061#2530
why ?

[04-May-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm wondering about the meaning of this `when doing hardforking change, changing the port is sometimes the best way
`

[04-May-19 11:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
we could try

[04-May-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
stop

[04-May-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
set minsigs to 10

[04-May-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
change to a new port

[04-May-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
minsigs is in the source code

[04-May-19 11:53 AM] mrlynch#5735
is it set in any other place apart from testnet.json?

[04-May-19 11:53 AM] SHossain#0007
no

[04-May-19 11:55 AM] CrisF#3405
So how will this work?
@mrlynch  to do a pull request for @SHossain ?

[04-May-19 11:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
17712 for the port?

[04-May-19 11:55 AM] SHossain#0007
let me change that to 10 and 17712

[04-May-19 11:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok

[04-May-19 11:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
don't forget to open 17712 in fw

[04-May-19 11:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Then we wrangle up 10 NNs?

[04-May-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
in the source code there is a define for minsigs, not sure how it is changed for kmdlabs

[04-May-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
2019testnet repo is a direct fork of your repo

[04-May-19 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
and, we are using master branch. not sure if dev branch was merge to master.

that's set to 13 but testnet.json is set to 11

[04-May-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
#define DPOW_MINSIGS 13
#define DPOW_MIN_ASSETCHAIN_SIGS 11

[04-May-19 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
oh wait.. that's for btc

[04-May-19 11:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
is that the mingsgis for btc though ?

[04-May-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe DPOW_MIN_ASSETCHAIN_SIGS is what applies, not sure

[04-May-19 12:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok... who here has a custom iguana that didn't rebuild? or should that matter?!

[04-May-19 12:00 PM] SHossain#0007
strange. it was working without changing the `dPoW.h` file

[04-May-19 12:01 PM] SHossain#0007
only changes were in `testnet.json` file

[04-May-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if minsigs is set 11 or above, it should work

[04-May-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if minsigs is set to 10 or less, it might notarize with 10 sigs, but it wont be accepted as valid

[04-May-19 12:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
we're currently set to 11

[04-May-19 12:03 PM] And1_89#6578
What do we do now ? have set to 10 and port changed to 17712

[04-May-19 12:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Port will be 17712.

[04-May-19 12:05 PM] CrisF#3405
No need to do anything yet, but please stay ready.

[04-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810

No no port switch

[04-May-19 02:19 PM] CrisF#3405
There were no changes made.

[04-May-19 02:20 PM] CrisF#3405
A few notas, but nothing more.

[04-May-19 02:22 PM] Strob#3417
4 pizzas and 2 TXSCLCC . It seems to have started at least. Only missing beer.

[04-May-19 02:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Prreviously when I was having trouble and restarted I'd get a few quick notas like that.  Then back to not able to get into the mask, even with many connections.

[04-May-19 02:26 PM] NNoperator#3835
Strange that we only have 17 nodes listed now, looks like a few operators are restarting,  and why is bestk at 18 if there are 17 nodes?

Hmm, urban dictionary has an intersting take on `nonce`.  I guess the cryptographic nonce better suits this context.
