on mainnet there are huge things at stake, so in case what you tested here happen, we ll all have to be well prepared and act accordingly

[28-Apr-19 11:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They can do that. Some others are too stubborn and wanted to stay in their proposed location to try increase efficiency withoug changing location 😂

so really cool that everybody grasped it, and can foresee what we have to be prepared against

Don t remember it s testnet, counts matter, sure, but don t try to find solutions where there aren t any problem, the randomness is real, tracking 6h chart is very cool, but don t fall into the addiction

stats that matters are on the long run, in very different conditions.

for my point about moving is that people have IP *x* in the startup and move to IP *y* and now others are stuck trying to connect to dead IPs and chase peers around the world. Yes it "works itself out quickish", but in the meantime it wastes time and effort of others

[28-Apr-19 11:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
we had the issues on mainnet

[28-Apr-19 11:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
people regularly changing, sometimes because they wanted to try increase counts

[28-Apr-19 11:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
due to the stability of the mainnet, it s really not a good idea to change everyday

[28-Apr-19 11:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
or at least it was

dont we just have to find the data that when hashed twice is equal to `1b549cfc12bd56569b5d1b73fa5cdda12ca5f681c648328b40445db4f41e15f5`?

I double hashed that word and its not it (or I dont know how to do the hashing correctly)

I rely on Decker to solve these things.  Don't know what to do if he isn't the solver...  😂

[29-Apr-19 05:48 PM] Greer#0666
I have the original image with all metadata, so much it could be and I'm working so cant spend time on it 😦  fun puzzle though.

[29-Apr-19 05:53 PM] Greer#0666
Decker said no clues or I'd ask if we're looking for text or binary data, if text, one or multiple words and capitalization or not

[29-Apr-19 06:01 PM] NNoperator#3835
I wonder if we need to add the previous bock header to the clue  and then hash it?

[29-Apr-19 06:04 PM] Greer#0666
worth a try.  but what are you hashing from the clue, the S-word? 😄

tried `sha256(sha256("this picture"))` and a few other variations on this, giving up 😂

in the example I linked to the bytes were reversed I didn't understand that.

That is called endian-ness, big endian vs little endian

Transaction puzzle
Transaction a4bfa8ab6435ae5f25dae9d89e4eb67dfa94283ca751f393c1ddc5a837bbc31b is an interesting puzzle.

scriptPubKey: OP_HASH256 6fe28c0ab6f1b372c1a6a246ae63f74f931e8365e15a089c68d6190000000000 OP_EQUAL
scriptSig: 
To spend the transaction you need to come up with some data such that hashing the data twice results in the given hash.

Stack    Script    Description
Empty.    <data> OP_HASH256 <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    
<data>    OP_HASH256 <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    scriptSig added to the stack.
<data_hash>    <given_hash> OP_EQUAL    The data is hashed.
<data_hash> <given_hash>    OP_EQUAL    The given hash is pushed to the stack.
true    Empty.    The hashes are compared, leaving true on the stack.
This transaction was successfully spent by 09f691b2263260e71f363d1db51ff3100d285956a40cc0e4f8c8c2c4a80559b1. The required data happened to be the Genesis block, and the given hash in the script was the genesis block header hashed twice with SHA-256. Note that while transactions like this are fun, they are not secure, because they do not contain any signatures and thus any transaction attempting to spend them can be replaced with a different transaction sending the funds somewhere else.

@Notary-Operator here 
Hey, notaries, remember I promised bounties for those, who put their time in exchange to making Komodo great again? Here it comes.
I will not make any puzzles, quests or tricky questions (when polo?). I decided to just pick those, who actually made things better or worked hard. 
1. @Alright for making our days harder and putting our attention on election weak side. Much disliked but needed thing. 50000 VOTE.
2. @Decker for being *real* election master. Bc almost all election tech side is actually made by him, not by me. 50000 VOTE.
3. @blackjok3r - just scroll this chat up to see who actually spends best years of life here. 50000 VOTE
4. @SHossain is constantly helping dev process (he denies that, but thats true) all the time. 50000 VOTE
5. @MadMaX for komodod.com. It's awesome. 50000 VOTE
6. @CHMEX won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
7. @CrisF won by testnet results. 50000 VOTE
8. @mrlynch as a pirate can get 1kk ARRR, but I only have VOTE's, so 50000 VOTE.
9. @Mylo - sometimes I underestimated much how hard marketing team and writers work also. Supported election public stuff. 50000 VOTE.
10. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 for being almost as cool as @Alright (joke). For activity in testnet and general participation. 50000 VOTE

Heroes above - please DM me your VOTE address (one and only). I will send batch when get all addresses.

And sorry to all others. I love you all and your donation to community is always valuable. But if we give VOTE's to everyone - there is no need for elections.

P.S.: Stop making long disattractive advertising nicks! Next time I did not find someone in discord hintbox - he misses the party :-p
