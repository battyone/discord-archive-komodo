[01-May-19 04:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
do you see anything like `[6] notarize BEER->KMD` ?

I don't log the output, I use tmux

👌

[01-May-19 04:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so here's what I promised yesterday, this is my 1st time doing something like this, so I'll start with a simple one, 7.777 KMD awaits for you in this P2SH address , it is very similar to Decker's puzzle, I only changed the secret, which is `vote4phba2061` (yeah I know it's lame 😂 ). The unlock condition is also similar:
```
OP_HASH256 sha256(sha256(vote4phba2061)) OP_EQUAL
```
since I already gave the secret message, I'll leave the calculation of double sha256 to you (the correct result 
 of the double hash starts with `09ff ...... 711`).
Then you'll have to build to correct script & rawtransaction to redeem the reward, hope you'll enjoy this like I did 😃 
https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bKkVULQfE6o4KXy7vUoNDsd3UGsfTB1Qbq
1st hint: you will eventually need to use these command: `decodescript` , `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction` ,  `createrawtransaction` , `sendrawtransaction`

[01-May-19 06:19 PM] Mylo#8306
approx on line 10
```
../agents/iguana testnet > iguana.log 2> error.log  &
```

[01-May-19 07:15 PM] Greer#0666
@PHBA2061 tried two different methods of double hashing `vote4phba2061` and got `213b414b3fc55817fb0b3fa9a69fc7a1db107c87af30f9fe5e10726b5aa2aa6d` both times.

[01-May-19 07:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what is your method ?

[01-May-19 07:16 PM] Greer#0666
one of them is ```#!/bin/bash

data=$1
openssl dgst -sha256 <<< $(openssl dgst -sha256 <<< ${data})```

[01-May-19 07:16 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Decker posted his php script of hash256, you can use that

[01-May-19 07:17 PM] popcornbag#4039
the testnet is not notarizaing , about 200 minutes last ones

[01-May-19 07:17 PM] Greer#0666
the other kinda same but with shasum

[01-May-19 07:17 PM] Greer#0666
will try deckers php see whats different

[01-May-19 07:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Decker's script should give 09ff...711  as output

[01-May-19 07:18 PM] Greer#0666
oh, bin2hex...

[01-May-19 07:19 PM] Greer#0666
👍 I see it now

[01-May-19 07:19 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, that's the difference

[01-May-19 07:20 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@popcornbag we had an update 3 hours ago

[01-May-19 07:21 PM] popcornbag#4039
i did restart iguana some minutes ago

[01-May-19 07:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
don't forget that minsigs is 12, so we'll have to wait for a while

[01-May-19 07:32 PM] popcornbag#4039
ok 👍

[01-May-19 08:05 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what I don't understand is if those who did update left a checkmark above (currently 9) then, there's still more than half running on the old version, then they should still notarize 😕

[01-May-19 08:12 PM] PHBA2061#2530
the moment I updated iguana is also the moment the notarizations stopped, may be just a coincidence

[01-May-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
it's not coincidence. minsig change is significant.

[01-May-19 08:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I was the 3rd one who updated , which means there were more than 20 nodes running on the old version with minsigs = 13, but they still didn't notarize, may be I have to look into the code to understand how significant minsigs changes are 😕

[01-May-19 09:15 PM] LeFevre#5755
<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=SHA2('256')From_Hex('Auto')SHA2('256')&input=dm90ZTRwaGJhMjA2MQ>  but no real clue how to send a tranasction lol

[01-May-19 09:16 PM] LeFevre#5755
Tried to read how you did Deckers, but eh, still unsure lol

[01-May-19 09:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that's the correct hash, the second step is to construct the script

[01-May-19 09:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
hint: you will eventually need to use these command: `decodescript` , `getrawtransaction`, `decoderawtransaction` ,  `createrawtransaction` , `sendrawtransaction`

[01-May-19 09:32 PM] LeFevre#5755
ya, i dont have a way to do those =(.

[01-May-19 09:34 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli help decodescript` may help you, 2 days ago I had no idea how to do it either 😃

[01-May-19 09:36 PM] LeFevre#5755

that's unfortunate

[01-May-19 10:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, have there been any notarizations since the update @Alright ?  Either by updated or non-updated nodes?

[01-May-19 10:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
apparently 0

[01-May-19 10:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Like you said, does seem strange that non-updated haven't been notarizing either.

[01-May-19 10:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Seeing some movement now.

[01-May-19 10:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no idea why, have to look into the codes to fully understand how it works 😂

[01-May-19 10:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Are we certain there haven't been any notarizations?  (I can't see any.)

[01-May-19 10:18 PM] CrisF#3405
@PHBA2061  How are your iguana connections?  I'm showing 25.

[01-May-19 10:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[01-May-19 10:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
as minsigs = 12, we need 2 more in order for notas to take place

[01-May-19 10:23 PM] CrisF#3405
No connections = not mask at all

[01-May-19 10:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
there are connections, the problem is consensus can't be reached

[01-May-19 10:25 PM] CrisF#3405
There should have been a few notas after update.

[01-May-19 10:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, at this number updated and a few who aren't participating probably matter of waiting.

[01-May-19 10:26 PM] CrisF#3405
But right after update announce and early updates, still should have been a couple at least.

[01-May-19 10:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
no, I was in the 3 last  notas on BEER, PIZZA and TXSCLCC, since the moment I updated, there weren't any nota, I checked the nota destination address

Yeah, I was there too.

[01-May-19 10:31 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, @deleted-role, 6 hours with no notarizations on the testnet.  Need a few more to update.  Please `git pull` ` ./m_notary_testnet`.  minsigs is now 12.  Thanks!

[01-May-19 10:33 PM] CrisF#3405
If you already updated after @Alright message 6 hours ago, please disregard the above.

[01-May-19 11:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
simply run git pull within the 2019NNtestnet folder

[01-May-19 11:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
then in separate command restart notarization process?

[01-May-19 11:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
git pull tells me im already up to date though i hadnt run git pull in a while ..

better kill iguana first with pkill -15 iguana , then git pull and after m_notary_testnet to run again
