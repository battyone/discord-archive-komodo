Hi @Lumbi , I had that when my node went down big time.

[08-May-19 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
I was suggested to `-reindex`, `reboot`, and then `You can also try -reindex-chainstate`.  I wanted to reboot anyhow, so did that.  Next time I'd try the  `-reindex-chainstate` frst.

[08-May-19 01:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Certainly didn't want to `-reindex` KMD unless it was the final option.

[08-May-19 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont reboot the server until you have stopped all daemons with the stop RPC. 😃

[08-May-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If a daemon is not stopping with the stop RPC, then that is a bug and I need to be told about it please.

is there a command to send max balance of asset coin to self?

[10-May-19 12:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or send balance ?

`./komodo-cli sendtoaddress <ADDRESS> $(./komodo-cli getbalance) "" "" true`

[10-May-19 12:59 PM] CrisF#3405
I use that to send to self.  Maybe someone else has a better way?

hard fork version will be released in june, activation end of june or early july

[12-May-19 11:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Awesome, thanks. So the pubkeys and information will be needed by early june?

[12-May-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[12-May-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
also, in the event that a candidate without any proven record of notarizations (past mainnet, testnet) gets elected, they need to prove they can before beginning of June, or lose their spot

[12-May-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so far, this is not an issue yet, but just wanted to be clear about that. it is possible that the first runnerup or even second will get the spot if we have a couple such winning candidates
