Introduce as many technical people to dPoW and Notary Nodes.
Notary Nodes election is like the festival over internet for us to bring some talented people to our ecosystem.

agreed

[29-Jan-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe we can focus on specific other communities, such as debian package maintainers, and open source project people that have all the skills, but probably never heard of us

[29-Jan-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, we should probably reach out to every coin which has added dpow and encourage them to run in the election, since we actually do

[29-Jan-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
most probably don't have the resources, but some might. And they can earn a stream of KMD while helping the network which they rely on

I estimate NN elections on june as was asked before. Long issue to add new NN.

[31-Jan-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@kolo to clarify, elections will be in June and external dpow coins will need to update soon after that? Many of our dpow coins want to plan around our election dates

[31-Jan-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

Remember to add GIN to your notary node!!! https://gist.github.com/leto/3a66158cc1378c899c751e3157e5e240

"Notary nodes can reasonably expect to make roughly 1800 $KMD per month in exchange for their contributions to the Komodo Platform community."

[12-Feb-19 10:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this mean 1,800 KMD per month, or $1,800 worth of KMD per month?

[12-Feb-19 10:54 PM] SHossain#0007
it's about 1500 KMD per month

[12-Feb-19 10:54 PM] SHossain#0007
the USD value will depend on market parice of KMD

[12-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
👌 makes sense

[12-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thnx

[12-Feb-19 11:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is it expected to run notary nodes locally?

[12-Feb-19 11:11 PM] SHossain#0007
no. Data center or dedicated server needed with high-end spec

[12-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
want to run one, figure I'll have to use VPS to make it happen though, at least until internet improves in my area

[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm actually close to being able to meet the spec, VPS will prob have to do for now though.

[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] SHossain#0007
and public  ip

[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
u know if Vultr hosting have a known best bang for buck plan which can fit the need ?

[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] SHossain#0007
good VPS should do the job with testing

all kind of benchmark scores show for plans

[12-Feb-19 11:14 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
these scores pertain to any relevant KMD notary node performance metric?

[12-Feb-19 11:15 PM] SHossain#0007
next season it may be 1TB SSD min requirements for mainnet

[12-Feb-19 11:16 PM] SHossain#0007
for testnet you need minimum 2 CPU cores. more threads are better

[12-Feb-19 11:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
when next season start ?

[12-Feb-19 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
q2

[12-Feb-19 11:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hmmm, storage seems a bit limited on vultr

[12-Feb-19 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
those are VPS. you need dedicated server

[12-Feb-19 11:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the top dedicated plan comes in just short of 1 TB by look of it

[12-Feb-19 11:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
4 x 120gb..

[12-Feb-19 11:18 PM] SHossain#0007
here is a spec of bare metal that is being used as mainnet NN
```
Chassis:    Intel 1U Server System R1208WFTYS, 8x 2.5" Drive Bays
Processor:    2x Intel Xeon Gold 6134 Processor - 8 Cores, 3.20GHz, 24.75MB Cache

[12-Feb-19 11:19 PM] SHossain#0007
building your own server and using co-location is ideal

@Dr.Terminus please go through this article. I wrote it keeping in mind to encourage more technical people inviting to participate in next Notary Nodes elections. It covers huge part of those questions.

[13-Feb-19 04:19 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
awesome. thanks a bunch

[13-Feb-19 04:20 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I'm prob going to wind up having to go the dedicated hosting route. Wish I had started research  on hardware involved sooner

[13-Feb-19 04:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
still not too late to start

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a good time to start, most people haven't

[13-Feb-19 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
and while lots of HW is good, mostly you need unlimited bandwidth, decent peering and lots of HD space. Some people use small VPSs, but they do more work to keep things performant. Beefier HW gives you some buffer

[13-Feb-19 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't recommend spending more than maybe $300 month. You can get physical 8 core machines for much less than that, which is what I used. Some NN ops use digitalocean droplets with huge amounts of cronjob automation. ymmv

[13-Feb-19 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
wallet management is a sizeable part of being notary

[13-Feb-19 03:59 PM] jorian#4555
if you get that right, you're a good notary. then 8-16 threads is plenty, no need to have 48 threads when iguana only uses one of them

[14-Feb-19 02:34 AM] kolo#1111
I would recommend >1Tb SSD. Ultra mega high expensive, but would do the job in case of buying hardware. Can happen we won't fit in 1Tb next year

[14-Feb-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, we don't control the size of external coins that add dpow

[14-Feb-19 01:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
how much space do you currently need to run all notarized chains on a nn?

[14-Feb-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, i have to go around and delete unnecessary junk to make room, if that helps 😃 I will look

[14-Feb-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
`/dev/md4        392G  358G   15G  97% /home`

[14-Feb-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
just BTC is 200GB of that

[14-Feb-19 01:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
thanks not too bad

[14-Feb-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
500GB disk is too small for next year

[14-Feb-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
each new external coin we add is a few more GBs, and then of course all chains keep growing

[14-Feb-19 01:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
and ram wise how much do you have used?

[14-Feb-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
changes over time i would say

[14-Feb-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
64GB ram

[14-Feb-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
iguana is using 13% of it

[14-Feb-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
less ram might suffice, i am not sure. sometimes there are memory leaks in iguana tho...

[14-Feb-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
i know some NNs have said iguana filled up their RAM sometimes. having more is a buffer against that

[14-Feb-19 01:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[14-Feb-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i know that @lukechilds probably runs the NN server with the "smallest" specs, a digitalocean droplet, and he gets very good numbers from lots of automation.  Not sure of the exact specs

[14-Feb-19 01:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
we use a physical 8 core box

[14-Feb-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
one massively important thing: make sure you don't pay for bandwidth!

[14-Feb-19 01:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes ec2 is no good:)

[14-Feb-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
running this stuff on AWS and paying for bandwidth would be crazy expensive

[14-Feb-19 01:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
I have on the explorers alone 2TB out per month

[14-Feb-19 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
free bandwidth, and good peering. See how many hops you are from other NNs

[14-Feb-19 01:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX yep, that is a lot 😃 I paid $400 in one month for Hush explorer bandwidth fees once, learned my lesson

[14-Feb-19 01:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
outsch that hurts

that tool will help you sort all NN IP's by how many hops they are from you

[14-Feb-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
we use it to connect to the closest/best NNs, but also good to see which NNs are close to a given IP

[16-Feb-19 06:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you mentioned digitalocean.. VPS offering or dedicated / bare metal both suitable offerings

[16-Feb-19 06:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
?

[16-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I don't want to skimp

[16-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
would manage the hardware myself if I lived where bandwidth was available

[16-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Handling self vs 24/7 support dedicated bandwidth is a lot of trouble for not so much gains

[16-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
good point

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
seems most viable to go with dedicated hosting

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
So lets take a scenario

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Vultr doesnt seem to have suitable offering though unless I'm missing something

[16-Feb-19 06:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

To host, but for tech and performance issues and also legal ones
