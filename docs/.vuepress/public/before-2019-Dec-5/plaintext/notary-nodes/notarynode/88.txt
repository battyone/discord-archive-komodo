@Mylo please @ me if there's something off with pirate's proposal

[05-Apr-19 04:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll edit it now and do a PR

[05-Apr-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but it was relative url, ./genie.jpg which is great when it's in the repo, but sucks for generating externally`
I forgot about that one, the reason is image size, I can't operate gimp, so feel free to resize it ad fix it how you like :troll:

[05-Apr-19 04:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
thank you!

[05-Apr-19 04:42 PM] Mylo#8306
np.   use absolute urls, check in browser that they open to the image source.   much more tranportable.  thanks for quick responses.  ok @mrlynch

@blackjok3r earlier? When I search recv in this channel history it was last year 😁
And at the same state last year everyone was "am I in the revc mask? Why am I not in the revmask" lol

[05-Apr-19 04:45 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Maybe there is a planned learning curve this year but I think it is time to introduce the concept

mean lil UTXOs 😡

[05-Apr-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Finally updated... Moved node to London and doubled its ram and CPU. See what happens. Also added another possible iguana optimization I am testing on mainnet aswell.

@NNoperator not big at all, just an improvement from 90mbps

[05-Apr-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well it found a server 3Km away so its bound to be fast.

[05-Apr-19 05:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
is that with ovh?

VULTR I use for testing VPS.

[05-Apr-19 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they got pretty good latley... Had some issues a while back with memory being full when it wasnt

[05-Apr-19 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
i like vultr.. only issue is they don't have big enough servers

[05-Apr-19 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
testing ionos now... they have good reviews, but so far not impressed 😒

[05-Apr-19 05:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
comes with what seems to be a hw firewall though

[05-Apr-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
64G should be plenty big enough 😛

[05-Apr-19 05:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
i only see 32G 😒

[05-Apr-19 05:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
i found something that i like at ionos.. it comes with a real minimal install... there's no sudo 😜

[05-Apr-19 05:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to upgrade the account... I have a few 64Gb ones avalible here

[05-Apr-19 05:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
$320 USD a month though

[05-Apr-19 05:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's pricey

[05-Apr-19 05:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
just got a 96 GB one for aprox $250 ... but the line's shit

[05-Apr-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that's pricey`
in my experience with them, I'd say "not really"

[05-Apr-19 06:10 PM] newvulcan#4719
Think I have the same question as @PHB2061 had back on the 16th of March, and I think the answer means everything is fine 😃 I've imported my btcwif key into bitcoin-cli but I only get "isvalid": true - no mention of "ismine" : true. I am right in assuming that everything has worked ?

[05-Apr-19 06:18 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@newvulcan  you must use bitcoin 0.16.3 , don't use the 0.17 version

✅ 😁 

[05-Apr-19 06:35 PM] newvulcan#4719
Thank @PHBA2061. I've just realised I'd been following some old install notes and not the updated ones. A quick skim through looks like the only difference is the install of bitcoind, but I'll re follow them just in case.

[05-Apr-19 06:43 PM] newvulcan#4719
...and it was going so well lol. Got to reindex the blockchain. That'll teach me to make sure I'm reading the right install guide

[05-Apr-19 07:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
Most likeley yes till after elections are completed. But who knows we need 7 sig to complete a notarization.

[05-Apr-19 07:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is literally starting to feel like some folks removed his pubkey from their nodes and went on without him_

[05-Apr-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your pubkey?

[05-Apr-19 07:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't think anyone removed key. all node should run same keylist

[05-Apr-19 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it was a joke 😛

[05-Apr-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
lol...ok

[05-Apr-19 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007
after each restart of iguana, it may take some time before a node fully start notarizing

[05-Apr-19 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have 1 chain that hasn't hit in 5.5 hrs and another that's at 25mins 😛

[05-Apr-19 07:28 PM] SHossain#0007
that is normal.

[05-Apr-19 07:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
I assume you dont have 10000 of utxos

[05-Apr-19 07:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`after each restart of iguana, it may take some time before a node fully start notarizing`
the "start" isn't the issue as much as everytime it starts running as expected we do a reset and it falls to the bottom of the pack again

[05-Apr-19 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CHMEX it's as optimal as can be and other than adding new folks it's the exact same as when it was neck and neck with alright

[05-Apr-19 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
**and** it's one of the 1st nodes to see most new blocks 😕

[05-Apr-19 07:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Hmm strange than I guess its just bad luck but yes strange guessing that you mine a lot connected directly to that notary node

[05-Apr-19 07:32 PM] NNoperator#3835
would the checkmasks script be adaptable to run in the testnet?

[05-Apr-19 07:33 PM] NNoperator#3835
is it as simple as changing the port?

[05-Apr-19 07:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`guessing that you mine a lot connected directly to that notary node`
yeah, most of the new blocks come from my mining nodes

[05-Apr-19 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figured it would be ezier (since we're only doing 3 chains) to have the chains active so folks can see everything constantly moving

[05-Apr-19 07:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It sure isn't for the 1.46407283 BEER I mined :troll:

[05-Apr-19 08:02 PM] zatJUM#9924
checkmasks works without changing the port

[05-Apr-19 08:20 PM] NNoperator#3835
I am not seeing anything yet,  are these the ports that we are using?    ```sudo ufw allow 51797 # TXSCLCC
sudo ufw allow 8922 # BEER
sudo ufw allow 11607 # PIZZA
sudo ufw allow 17711 # iguanatestnet```

[05-Apr-19 08:50 PM] zatJUM#9924
What komodo repo/branch do you have?

[05-Apr-19 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true 1`     to start PoW mining
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate false`       to stop
