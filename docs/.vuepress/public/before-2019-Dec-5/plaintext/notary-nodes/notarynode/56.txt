Haha, that generator is getting a lot of use recently.

[30-Mar-19 03:35 AM] Strob#3417
I prefer using the paper wallet generator , create 5000 addresses and choose one that I like

[30-Mar-19 03:37 AM] CrisF#3405
What paper wallet generator are you using Strob? `https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024508-paper-wallet-guide` ?

There is a tab to create thousands of addresse

[30-Mar-19 03:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I have a large list from that generator.

`There is a tab to create thousands of addresse`
Or you can just run the daemon on an air-gaped PC and `dumpwallet` a couple times

I just used `getnewaddress` for testnet NN (following this: `https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet `), but @SHossain 's guide  ( `https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/setup-Komodo-Notary-Node.html#setting-up-supernet-iguana` is making an `encrypted iguana wallet`.  I also found this: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/How-to-Generate-Address-and-Private-Key-(WIF)-for-3rd-Party-Coins-Using-Passphrase`.

[30-Mar-19 03:47 AM] CrisF#3405
Which method should I use for mainnet NN?

[30-Mar-19 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
does anyone here know if an uncompressed pubkey will for for NN?

```no ( -> PIZZA) utxo: need to fund address.(RU2Wi8FGdheQXSfHzgtMANB6JJTLchfHhE) or wait for splitfund to confirm
dont have PIZZA RU2Wi8FGdheQXSfHzgtMANB6JJTLchfHhE utxo, please send funds```
🤔 i have PIZZA; KMD is split

[30-Mar-19 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For mainnet u can just use a KMD wif as the iguana passphrase like labs does

[30-Mar-19 06:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wait for splitfund to confirm`
Is there a big ass block of hex just before that in the output?

[30-Mar-19 06:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
it is

[30-Mar-19 06:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
but it does that every time

[30-Mar-19 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
k, then just wait, that hex is the split tx

[30-Mar-19 06:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or maybe try:
`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA resendwallettransactions`

[30-Mar-19 06:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
```komodo-cli -ac_name=PIZZA resendwallettransactions

[30-Mar-19 06:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
if i do listunspent i only have 2 PIZZA utxo

[30-Mar-19 06:08 AM] gt#2812
did you split pizza?

[30-Mar-19 06:16 AM] Mylo#8306
i went through notary setup, waiting for kmd chain to sync, but here's my instructions step-by-step so far.   obv i'm not on testnet yet but if anyone gets stuck on something, here's how i've done the setup so far.
will continue adding and then update docs where necessary.   the docs seem to be up to date up until this point.
i compiled bitcoin from v0.16.3 instead of relying on some ppa repositoty (on ubuntu)

installation is pretty straight forward.
system setup pretty straight forward.
utxo management - probably a cpl more docs about it, but this is a new performance stuff from the last 12 months.

OK, so @mrlynch has funds, but only 2 UTXOs and iguana isn't auto splitting it for him

[30-Mar-19 06:19 AM] Mylo#8306
kill iguana, wait for utxo's to come back.
may have to resync PIZZA if they're not in wallet.

[30-Mar-19 06:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
they're in the wallet

[30-Mar-19 06:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the wallet shows them and good on confirms

[30-Mar-19 06:20 AM] mrlynch#5735

how do I turn off auto split?

[30-Mar-19 11:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
** jorian yesterday:
if you want to disable autosplit, you have to edit the m_notary_testnet file, and add notary_nosplit as a parameter to ../agents/iguana
but, testnet is already a parameter to that binary, so i don't know if nosplit needs to go before or after testnet
**
i did not try that

[30-Mar-19 11:51 AM] Strob#3417
I tried it and it didn't work before or after testnet

[30-Mar-19 11:52 AM] Strob#3417
I also tried with " " in between and didn't work either

[30-Mar-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419

To disable no split on testnet you need to use labs iguana or blacktest branch of my repo.. Its not possible to pass it no split and a json file.

Hi guys, we want to officialize our candidacy for re-election of our North America Region node. Remember that we depend a lot on these nodes to have continuity of our business and dont receive any further investment other than the revenue from our services and these notary nodes. We leave our proposal attached to this message so that you can take a look and share it with your peers. We count with your vote!

after the change, the number of notarizations went up a lot.

[30-Mar-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the server has a software raid setup.

I have 2 960 pro 1Tb in my workstation but they don't make much difference for my regular work so I will put them in a node and see.
