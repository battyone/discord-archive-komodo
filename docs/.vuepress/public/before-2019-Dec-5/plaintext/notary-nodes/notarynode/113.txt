Setting up a notary node?

[11-Apr-19 12:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes for NNtest

[11-Apr-19 04:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Deleted User where is your testnet node located?

[11-Apr-19 09:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think he needs to prove he can get this going by himself.

Help can be given once its set.

Am I right in that it can take quite a while to mine a TXSCLCC block ? Must admit I'd forgotten I'd set it mining at the weekend

[11-Apr-19 09:43 AM] CrisF#3405
It shouldn't take long. I mined 124 in a few minutes.  That was a while ago, but shouldn't take long.

[11-Apr-19 09:44 AM] newvulcan#4719
Hmm, I'll check it again once I'm added to the testnet later today, then I can do a clean reboot and test all my startup scripts.

[11-Apr-19 09:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you mean you haven't been able to mine?

[11-Apr-19 09:46 AM] newvulcan#4719
It might be. If I should have had something by now, I'll delve into the log files a bit deeper, see if there are any error messages. I'll also double check I've opened all the necessary ports through my firewall

We have submitted a PR in order to add a NN on testnet

`Am I right in that it can take quite a while to mine a TXSCLCC block ? `
Like any other coin, it depends on your hashrate and the diff

[11-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
We would like to make some tests prior being elected - if we are elected - as NN in the mainnnet

So easy to miss something small. Realised i hadn't opened port 51797 for TXSCLCC - Hopefully that will make a difference

@newvulcan what are you trying to do?

[11-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Lumbi#8378
what is this error again? 
`>>>>>>>>>>> KMD dpow_sendrawtransaction ({"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"}
)`

[11-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Mylo#8306
do you have UTXOs for KMD?  `komodo-cli listunspent | grep 10000 | wc -l`

[11-Apr-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its ambigious

[11-Apr-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
usually its no utxo, because of a bug in nthe official iguana

[11-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Lumbi#8378
`998`

[11-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did it just happen?

[11-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Lumbi#8378
yes

[11-Apr-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok i'll check my node if its there 2 we ahave a problem

[11-Apr-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nope no error on my node. It indicates some kind of connection problem. You node is trying to send a transaction with either the wrong sig in the wrong place, or a missing sig

[11-Apr-19 12:35 PM] PHBA2061#2530
did you already clean the dust 2 days ago ?

[11-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Lumbi#8378
ok. where is the iguana dictionary? I'd like to brush up on *iguanidae*... 😎

[11-Apr-19 12:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listunspent | jq length`

[11-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Lumbi#8378
I got that far, but this jams:
`./komodo-cli createrawtransaction "[{"txid":"myid","vout":0}]" "{"address":0.01}"`

[11-Apr-19 12:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
which means you didn't do it correctly

[11-Apr-19 12:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
what exactly are your command inputs then, and what is the error ?

[11-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Lumbi#8378
It's a JSON syntax error...

[11-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Lumbi#8378
most likely ..

[11-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Lumbi#8378
if this is the dust, what would the createrawtransation look like?
`/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listunspent | jq '.[] | select(.amount > 0.0001) | .'
{
  "txid": "cf262feea28284be43bfa8f153a19af0a8eb65f7b3e83645e041f04e2363f57c",
  "vout": 0,
  "generated": false,
  "address": "RNf1YmRnq6Mc3FayVYPNJVr1KUHXhjn3SH",

  "scriptPubKey": "76a91492b9ff07e02c675f2dd3afebcdd53c16ebd72bc688ac",
  "rawconfirmations": 17895,
  "confirmations": 17895,
  "spendable": true`

[11-Apr-19 12:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`  "txid": "cf262feea28284be43bfa8f153a19af0a8eb65f7b3e83645e041f04e2363f57c",
  "vout": 0,`
is what you  need for the input

[11-Apr-19 12:53 PM] PHBA2061#2530
don't tell me you copy paste exactly `./komodo-cli createrawtransaction "[{"txid":"myid","vout":0}]" "{"address":0.01}"` ? 😕

[11-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@Lumbi you really need to do the basics yourself and if it is too hard that means being an NN is too hard

@Alright Just trying to get it to mine a block - its been trying since Sunday, and I only noticed this morning that it didn't have its port open through my firewall

[11-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Lumbi#8378
@jl777c well I could of just deleted the wallet.dat, but wanted to stick in the back with the dust, until I figured it out. 😉

[11-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Lumbi#8378
haven't really weathered a dust storm before now...

[11-Apr-19 12:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that is a bad excuse, the attack was 2 days ago already

[11-Apr-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
NN need to make solutions, not excuses

[11-Apr-19 12:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so you decided to leave your node like that for 2 days ?

[11-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Lumbi#8378
