From just abandoned nodes to necromancy üòÉ

What are you planning on doing for abandoned nodes mid year?

[15-Apr-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
a handful of abandoned nodes is not much of a problem

[15-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
we have at least 2 right now

[15-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
solution is don't reelect them

but when a NN doesn't perform any notarization KMD->BTC, does it earn KMD or not ?

We're both vying for the same job and you don't think it's proper for me to point out that you did poorly the last time you had that job?

[15-Apr-19 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
You ran 2 nodes that combined, literally, had less notarizations than some single nodes that only ran for 6 months

[15-Apr-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
And it's not right to point that out?

[15-Apr-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Or to refer to you/it when a question is asked that is a direct parallel?

I'm surprised to read that operators who failed to keep their node up to par because 'life happened' are still eligible for reelection.
That said, my own testnet node sucks and I cannot find any resources on improving performance, just that wallets should be kept small and network connectivity should be good.  I have those things yet still performing poorly compared to others.

ah, didn't know that.  I am not managing manually, wondered why people did that

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Greer#0666
I've read the scripts that do it for you, seems quite simple but thought that was a thing of the past.  Will get on that then.

Is there still an issue with splits not returning change to the wallet on BEER?

[15-Apr-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or has this resolved itself in some way? I missed a few days of chat here it seems.

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
All I know is iguan split works nice, and running split / selfsend / cleanwallettx too close together is a bad idea

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a-team does split evvery 15mins (if needed) and cleanwallettx rpc every 6H

[15-Apr-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sometimes it seems it may not clean due to utxo hanging around but its never goten into a bad state

[15-Apr-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got split at */15, selfsend at 55 */8 and run cleanwallet mannually

there are many many ways to clean wallet.. I found a way that worked for me so I dont need to sepnd time tending to node, early on I psent nearly all day with it up on terminal just watching it...

[15-Apr-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now it almost the opposite... but right now seems places are locked in. I am using ti to test radical changes to uiguana to amke it more stable with very long run times.

$40 8GB VPS here

[15-Apr-19 05:47 AM] hastrup#8742
its just what i have at home, would it be good enough for a "real" notarynote

[15-Apr-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would just work with current requirements

[15-Apr-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but 128GB ram is better. Most  imporetant is I/O speed
