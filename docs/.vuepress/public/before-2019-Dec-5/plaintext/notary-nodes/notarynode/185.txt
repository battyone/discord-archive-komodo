[03-May-19 01:30 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah looks similar....ah i took a photo of my missus with a frog buddha next to her last week

[03-May-19 01:37 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok.. full day later and still no beer nx's

[03-May-19 01:38 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
pulling latest 2019nntestnet and restarting m_notary_testnet didn't change anything for me when everyone started notarizing again

How was your wallet after the dwy_attack?  Did you get it cleaned up ok @Dr.Terminus ?

[03-May-19 01:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you mean I should  run walletreset script ?

[03-May-19 01:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
walletreset.sh

[03-May-19 01:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
in stakednotary folder i have

[03-May-19 01:42 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
think i went unconventional route here.. perhaps was provided help from a kmdlabs operator who clued me into this repo..

[03-May-19 01:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Was wondering if you might have -reindexed or something since the attack.

[03-May-19 01:43 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i have not run any reindex command Im aware of

[03-May-19 01:43 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
just activating asset chains after system reboots

[03-May-19 01:44 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ran a coupleapt get update / upgrades for the os but thats all.. did the latest git pull and restarted m notary testnet

[03-May-19 01:53 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
according to stats script

[03-May-19 01:53 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I often find creative and ridiculous corners to work myself into

[03-May-19 01:54 AM] CrisF#3405
And this `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq '[.[] | select(.bestk > 0)] | . |length'`?

[03-May-19 01:55 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
utxo's have dropped in number... should i run m_notary_testnet again after cleaning wallets ?

[03-May-19 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
utxos go down when you spend them, which indicates it is notarizeing

[03-May-19 01:56 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I had like 10x the usual

[03-May-19 01:57 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
presuambly from some dwy attack ?

[03-May-19 01:57 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that a member ?

[03-May-19 01:59 AM] CrisF#3405
No, you'd have had 10 of thousands of time if you were attacked.

[03-May-19 02:00 AM] CrisF#3405
The dwy_attack was a test we had early on.

[03-May-19 02:01 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
well, I did have 100+ for utxo's on asset chains

[03-May-19 02:01 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
while I have kept my setting for target and threshold between like 10 and 4

[03-May-19 02:02 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
again, I figured the difference somehow stemmed from the latest git pull, only this walletreset seems to have reverted utxo target back to 9 for me

[03-May-19 02:04 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
any time I have gotten the nn running properly / competitively notarizing it has taken a while after resets / resyncs for activity to seem to begin and later pick up speed

[03-May-19 02:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I've usually experience that too.

[03-May-19 02:08 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
my utxo for kmd just dubled in last like 10 mins lol

[03-May-19 02:08 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and its super high now

[03-May-19 02:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you have the autosplitter off?

[03-May-19 02:09 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
its on crontab like always..

[03-May-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Autosplit must be active mate

[03-May-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Maybe? Or your splitter isn't working correctly

[03-May-19 02:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, if you set up the node again you'll need to disable the autosplit again.

[03-May-19 02:12 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
splitter has not changed

[03-May-19 02:12 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
only the 4 values for target and threshold

[03-May-19 02:13 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this same script,again in Stakednotary github repo pull I was pointed towards, which has worked to get me close to top 5 within 6 - 12 hour nx's stats

[03-May-19 02:13 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269

start of my my utxosplitter script, including only 4 values i have ever altered

[03-May-19 02:16 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
`#!/bin/bash
cd "${BASH_SOURCE%/*}" || exit

# Optionally just split UTXOs for a single coin
# e.g "KMD"

kmd_target_utxo_count=9
kmd_split_threshold=6

other_target_utxo_count=9
other_split_threshold=6

date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S)
`

[03-May-19 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
You have to uncomment  line 2203 in `iguana/main.c `

[03-May-19 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
then rebuild.

[03-May-19 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
That will disable the autosplit in iguana.

[03-May-19 02:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Then you can use your own splitter.

[03-May-19 02:23 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
`  myinfo->dpowsock = myinfo->dexsock = myinfo->pubsock = myinfo->subsock = myinfo->reqsock = myinfo->repsock = -1;
    myinfo->psockport = 30000;
    myinfo->nosplit = 1; // uncomment for testnet nosplit
    if ( arg != 0 )
`

[03-May-19 02:23 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
like so ?

[03-May-19 02:23 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok to leave that secodn comment commented ?

[03-May-19 02:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I've watched chainzilla interviews

[03-May-19 02:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I like their aim

[03-May-19 02:27 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Their focus on utilizing KMD bodes well for both teams futures

[03-May-19 02:28 AM] CrisF#3405
It's this line dr.terminus `https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/9d7ae94aa8ba7a2c17bc7b2b3e76f17e99e1d5a3/iguana/main.c#L2203`

[03-May-19 02:28 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yep

[03-May-19 02:28 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
browsed to it in nano

deleted first two //

[03-May-19 02:29 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
left the tailing comment though

[03-May-19 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
Uncomment the first part and leave the `//` on the comment.

[03-May-19 02:29 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
saved

[03-May-19 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
now rebuild.

[03-May-19 02:29 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
./m_notary_testnet?

[03-May-19 02:30 AM] CrisF#3405
You might have to `2019NNtestnet/agents/iguana` (to make sure proper place is rebuilt)

[03-May-19 02:31 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
havent been in agents dir before..

[03-May-19 02:31 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i did restart m_notary_testnet

[03-May-19 02:31 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not utxo's up in 50's for all assets

[03-May-19 02:32 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
pizza and txs bot getting nx's though

[03-May-19 02:32 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
do i need to stop / start komodod service ?

[03-May-19 02:32 AM] CrisF#3405
You need to rebuild, not restart.

[03-May-19 02:33 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sorry, total newb here

[03-May-19 02:33 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
rebuild what ? how ?

[03-May-19 02:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Me too, haha.

[03-May-19 02:48 AM] CrisF#3405
rebuild iguana.

[03-May-19 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
delete `2019NNtestnet/agents/iguana` and do `./m_notary_testnet` and it will rebuild

[03-May-19 04:01 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah if your chains are running and no errors in debug.log then your attention should go to wallet related stuff (size/speed/utxo count/spendable tx eg not mined) and iguana (the notarizer)

[03-May-19 04:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Wallet is not part of blockchain, it hold your key and is a database of relevant tx stuff (wallet.dat).   There are no coins in your wallet, it‚Äôs all on chain.

Wallet vital data is your key.

How many ppl are managing their own utxo splitting?

[03-May-19 05:22 AM] Strob#3417
I think everyone maybe except SHossain are splitting manually

[03-May-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say he is aswell tbh. Could eb wrong though... At least he would ahve changed the minimum amounts in iguana to use it autosplit.

[03-May-19 05:51 AM] Mylo#8306
ok good to know.
are people using cron to do it automatically or just manually tracking it?

[03-May-19 05:56 AM] phm87#7395
I am using a .sh script with a loop

[03-May-19 05:57 AM] phm87#7395
Most ppl are using a crontab I think

[03-May-19 06:09 AM] Strob#3417
crontab works perfectly on my side

[03-May-19 06:12 AM] Mylo#8306
ok good, just making sure your'e not creating work for yourself but you know what's going on.

[03-May-19 06:13 AM] Mylo#8306
do you send notifications if it fails?   either thru a mail api, scp output to another box (like simple text accessible by web server) or telegram?

[03-May-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how does it fail? üòÑ

[03-May-19 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Mine hasnt failed once in like 117 days uptime so far with nothing  touched... that said it seems to be up and down like a yoyo in counts, top one day last the next NO IDEA whats happening there

[03-May-19 06:14 AM] Mylo#8306
too big a split (not enough balance) or the no duplicates error where you need to send to yourself

[03-May-19 06:15 AM] Mylo#8306
i send notif every split üòÑ

[03-May-19 06:44 AM] Strob#3417
I make it write the output to a log file so I can check it if I suspect any failure. But you will see if it fails or not by just monitoring your stats utxo count

[03-May-19 06:46 AM] Strob#3417
Like this for example: running autosplit for kmd every 15 minutes
```CSS
*/15 * * * * /home/username/komodo_scripts/autosplitKMD.sh >>/home/username/komodo_scripts/autosplitKMDLog 2>&1
```
