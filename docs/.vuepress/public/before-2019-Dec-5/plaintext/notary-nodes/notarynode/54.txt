in testnet it shouldn't affect anything

./m_notary_testnet ?

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Strob#3417
yes

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, not much nodes etc

[29-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Strob#3417
ok @SHossain  cool if you say it! It would be a lot simpler!

[29-Mar-19 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
700 for KMD and 100 for AC is normal and it is set by default

[29-Mar-19 02:54 PM] Strob#3417
ok cool!

[29-Mar-19 02:55 PM] SHossain#0007
on mainnet some ops use nosplit option to manually split via cron or other ways

[29-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s an **optim**

[29-Mar-19 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000

dont' remember the exact PR, but i remember it was Kolo or Decker's PR that fixed this. before that some coins wouldn't split automatically after a while

[29-Mar-19 03:03 PM] NNoperator#3835
autospliting has been working flawlessly.  Any AC  UTXO count drops to 49 it gets +50 more like clockwork.

reminds me I used nosplit option day 1

[29-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
and never looked back :p just on labs back in the day

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User why haven't you done a PR to add labs scripts to nn test yet? :troll:

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
only if you have few different eligible utxos that can be splitted, iguana can try splliting it multiple times. as, iguana try to split when require and until splitted utxos are confirmed it tries again and again. on that time, it can use other utxos

[29-Mar-19 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
hence, there can be a lot of utxos

[29-Mar-19 03:51 PM] SHossain#0007
you can send PR @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[29-Mar-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I did, someone has to accept and commit it 😛

[29-Mar-19 03:53 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok. then, it is only @Alright since it's in his personal repo.

anyone got a link to bootstrap BTC?

[29-Mar-19 07:35 PM] Strob#3417
I look hard but didn't find a trustable one... so it's the only one I didn't use the bootstrap.

[29-Mar-19 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
guess I'll just use `scp` 🤷🏽

[29-Mar-19 07:41 PM] Strob#3417
bitcoin.org stopped providing it since 2014 cause they say it's not faster to download than by the usual way.

[29-Mar-19 07:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
faster if you're only setting up 1 PC, ~~yes~~maybe; not if you're doing 5 remotes 😛

[29-Mar-19 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_ thinks not enough people have updated testnet because he still has 0 notarizations_

[29-Mar-19 07:55 PM] Strob#3417
I haven't done one since 1:09 pm

I'll upgrade my ssd for a samsung M.2 960 evo pro raid soon

[29-Mar-19 07:57 PM] Strob#3417
We'll see if it notarize faster

[29-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Strob#3417
so 3 hours ago

[29-Mar-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3hrs is about the time that some updated and some didn't 😛

[29-Mar-19 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think that the last notarization tx was around that time 06:10 pm GMT +1

[29-Mar-19 08:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah that's right

[29-Mar-19 08:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I notice that each time we  relaunch iguana after adding nodes, we have to wait for a while before there are enough nodes online, but I'm not entirely sure

They probably say that because in fact they don't want to admit the real reason.

`I notice that each time we relaunch iguana after adding nodes, we have to wait for a while before there are enough nodes online, but I'm not entirely sure`
Whatever the minsig is, it has to be that much or more that agree

[29-Mar-19 08:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, last time minsigs was 5, this time it is 6, so there must be at least 6 nodes before a notarization can happen I guess

[29-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Strob#3417
exactly

[29-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
have we not notarized yet?

[29-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419

We haven't had a notarization since, meaning 6 people haven't(or another problem 🤷 ). If 5 people leave a 👍 I'll lower the sigs to 5

[29-Mar-19 09:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
Updated, but still cannot sync beer and pizza, haven't found the reason (even disabled the fw). For each IP I have ```connect() to 52.65.58.103:13350 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)```

if it isn't 8922 and 11607, you might be starting them with the wrong params
