[09-Apr-19 03:33 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
both helped me a lot!

[09-Apr-19 03:33 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Now I can see in a fancy table that I have been notarizing nothing since almost 4 hours ago 😦

What locale do you use @MadCryptoHead ?

[09-Apr-19 03:40 PM] zatJUM#9924
(for your system)

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] gt#2812
try keep your utxo count under 20

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] gt#2812
make sure your p2p ports are open

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
@zatJUM es_ES.UTF-8

[09-Apr-19 03:47 PM] zatJUM#9924
So in Spain you have a decimal separator = comma?

[09-Apr-19 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it all works fine in the US, move here now while you still can :troll:

[09-Apr-19 03:48 PM] zatJUM#9924
I never wanted Macron, but I wouldn't like Trump neither 😦

[09-Apr-19 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no one that's met him does

[09-Apr-19 03:49 PM] zatJUM#9924
When I was young I wanted to visit USA. No more now 😦

[09-Apr-19 03:51 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Yes, and as far as I know in the US they use the period sign, right?

[09-Apr-19 03:51 PM] zatJUM#9924
Yes, that's why scripts often fail

[09-Apr-19 03:51 PM] zatJUM#9924
bc command over all

[09-Apr-19 03:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
`echo "2,2+2" | bc
(standard_in) 1: syntax error`

[09-Apr-19 03:52 PM] zatJUM#9924
`echo "2.2+2" | bc
4.2`

[09-Apr-19 03:53 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I going to change the locales to en_US

[09-Apr-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because in scripts a comma is a "delimiter"

[09-Apr-19 03:56 PM] zatJUM#9924
if you see "invalid number", you should first think about that!

[09-Apr-19 04:25 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
OK, now I am fighting with my system

[09-Apr-19 04:25 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have restarted the server and now I have the proper locales

[09-Apr-19 04:26 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
thanks

[09-Apr-19 04:47 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok I have started everything again

[09-Apr-19 04:48 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Now it is running

[09-Apr-19 04:49 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
How many time should take to get a notarization?

[09-Apr-19 04:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
just be patient

[09-Apr-19 04:52 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Check the out put of this command `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"agent\":\"dpow\",\"method\":\"active\"}" | jq -c .[]`
if your node masks are not 0, then that's a good sign.

[09-Apr-19 04:58 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I have run that request but it is taking a while

[09-Apr-19 05:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
can you check this `komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listunspent | jq '[.[] | select(.amount == 0.0001)]| length'` ?

[09-Apr-19 06:00 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Yes, the output shows 0

[09-Apr-19 06:00 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
for pizza 99

[09-Apr-19 06:00 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
and for TXSCLCC 50

[09-Apr-19 06:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
how about  komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER listunspent | jq length

[09-Apr-19 06:08 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I think you haven't clean the dust from yesterday yet

[09-Apr-19 06:09 PM] PHBA2061#2530
we have a priv-testnet channel, you may find valuable instruction you need there

take a look at the 2019-priv-testnet channel

[09-Apr-19 06:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, I'm in

[09-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
could someone tell me the command to list balances by address?

[09-Apr-19 06:12 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
I am going to take a look

[09-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
I have a phantom balance on my KMD node somehow 😫

[09-Apr-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
like no unspent utxos and yet it shows a balance

[09-Apr-19 06:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unlockunspent?

[09-Apr-19 06:15 PM] phm87#7395
Weird : when I look at global stats of testnet it seems that nobody nota anything since some time

Legend, thanks

[09-Apr-19 08:49 PM] Alright#0419
Ok, kind of nailed down exactly what my problem was

[09-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
KMD daemon was showing a tiny amount more in `getbalance` than the UTXOs actually added up to

[09-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
so it was convinced it had more unspent UTXOs than it actually did, if it tried to use these UTXOs, the notarization round would fail

[09-Apr-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
fix was empty the wallet entirely, resend coins back to wallet and resplit UTXOs

[09-Apr-19 08:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
rounding errors?

[09-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
db error is my guess

[09-Apr-19 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
did a lot of funky stuff on my nodes yesterday

[09-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
mining KMD to my testnet node then not properly handling these block rewards really killed me past couple days

[09-Apr-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
derp

[09-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
was a good test at least

[10-Apr-19 12:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
or more exactly the balance just goes crazy and skip utxos

[10-Apr-19 12:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
randomly, only a resync gives funds back

only workaround I have is to maintain a serv consistently syncing the NN wallet

[10-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Strob#3417
In one of my DC comics I was reading while watching the Disney Channel  and having a Diet Coke I found a Discount Code for a Data Center hosting in the District of Columbia. But they didn't take my Debit Card so I plugged myself on Direct Current and soon all I will be needing is a Death Certificate. 😂

[10-Apr-19 01:53 PM] Strob#3417
Thought about that while wondering what DC meant!
