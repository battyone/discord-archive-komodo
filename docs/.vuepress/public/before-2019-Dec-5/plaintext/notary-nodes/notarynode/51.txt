Does the number of tx on my BEER address can tell me how many notarizations I did? https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/address/RGmYfVy6U9m27cQ5ade3b9QSnbyXG3LTFD

[26-Mar-19 05:54 PM] jorian#4555
yes, you can count how many txns your address did to the RX..nhA addy

Weird thing: when I try to log iguana output to a file (by uncomenting that part in m_notary_testnet, iguana just die after a short time.

[26-Mar-19 07:05 PM] Strob#3417
../agents/iguana testnet > iguana.log 2> error.log  &

[26-Mar-19 07:22 PM] jorian#4555
hmm

[26-Mar-19 07:22 PM] jorian#4555
i use nohup: `stdbuf -oL nohup ../agents/iguana testnet &`

[26-Mar-19 07:23 PM] jorian#4555
then, after it says something like: output appended to nohup

[26-Mar-19 07:23 PM] jorian#4555
you can get to the log at any time, using `tail -f SuperNET/iguana/nohup.out`

personnally I don t output to a file and just screen (or tmux like suggested earlier)

[26-Mar-19 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can play with the buffer and check ntrz rounds

[26-Mar-19 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
it may be ultra stupid but a file means I/O. maybe it s not relevant... but ^^

[26-Mar-19 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
(was addicted to files when doing my first cli scripts... and when it comes to parsing it always was a pain and for big operations the db always was the solution... ) Files need to be handled, take space and you ll never need to come back to xxx days back in time unless hardcore debugging

[26-Mar-19 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
plus, learning how to use a screen session manager will help you in future tasks

[26-Mar-19 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
the cool thing is that you don t even need to change the file at all

[26-Mar-19 10:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
so you won t have any doubt : it crashed... is it my wording ?

[26-Mar-19 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
"keep it vanilla, or at least make it think it is :p"

[27-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Strob#3417
Ok so for tmux we don't need log file? I'll try that.

[27-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Strob#3417
For the testnet is it allowed to installed more than one server for testing purposes, so I can try different things on each one? If yes can I use the same pubkey?

[27-Mar-19 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you would need more than on pubkey, and I cant see why we cant add more than on for each person. Thats a good idea actaully. Tmux and no log files here always, you can scroll up 4000 lines per pane. Which for me is enough usually... If there is some error that is reoccuring I add a log out to file inside the actual program, iguana or komodod, if a log doesnt already exist. Not really something most operators would need though.

[27-Mar-19 01:21 AM] Strob#3417
So more than one pubkey but on the same ip, will it work?

[27-Mar-19 01:25 AM] Strob#3417
I could install 6 other nodes, I would just need to order a few ssd drive to get enough space.

[27-Mar-19 01:26 AM] Strob#3417
For the tesnet is ther some kind of mining going on too?

[27-Mar-19 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think you can install it ont he same IP

[27-Mar-19 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you would need  VMs and diffrent public Ips

[27-Mar-19 01:26 AM] Strob#3417
oups.

[27-Mar-19 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no mining o0n testnet... Its only there to teach how to setup and use iguana

[27-Mar-19 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mining is like a single caommand... really dont need to do anything... you  set it to on and leave it all year... A script to withdraw the mined funds off is a must, but there  are plenty on giut ready to go, stick your address in it and let it run

[27-Mar-19 01:28 AM] Strob#3417
Ok cool!

[27-Mar-19 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can help you isntall multiple iguana on the same IP but its really not going to be easy, you need to change iguana code and all kinds of stuff and I highly doubt it would work very welll as you can only ahve outgoing connections

[27-Mar-19 01:31 AM] Strob#3417
ok... I'll think about it... I'll see if I can have more than  one ip with my provider.

[27-Mar-19 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have 3 on my server then forward it by MAC address works fine... depsnds if you use a hypervisor though... which is highly reccomended by just about only me üòÑ

[27-Mar-19 01:42 AM] Strob#3417
Do you use DDNS?

[27-Mar-19 01:44 AM] Strob#3417
Or maybe it's a dumb question ddns is for when your ip is changing..... but how do you gat 3 ip, you pay for 3 internet account from your provider and have 3 modems and 3 router?

[27-Mar-19 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No, I got a fairly custom setup at eh DC it wasnt cheap... 
There is the quad CPU server, with 4 1gbit eth ports. Vmware ESXi 6.5 runs off dual SDcards. 
Then each VM you can assign a MAC address to it, one of the eth ports goes through a diffrent subnet at eh DC where they filter by MAC address to  a public IP and I just set the operating system on that eth port with the public IP they supplied me...

[27-Mar-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we can add as many Ips as we like, but the problem is they all share the same 1gbit eth port

[27-Mar-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so at some poiint its going to be heavily bottlenecked.

[27-Mar-19 01:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
even excluding initial sync ? oO

[27-Mar-19 01:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have loads of network cards here that came wth it buit I took them out

[27-Mar-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The plan was to use all the pci-e ports for nvem .. but i nver did it as I found software optimize was a far better way to go

[27-Mar-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But using heaps of eth ports the DC stuff gets more expensive I think...

[27-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
housing here is approx half cost of NN xD

NN cost half what my mortgage is ... but it was like a $3500 upfront cost to buy the server and SSDs to start with

[27-Mar-19 01:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully lasts multiple years tho

need to setup a dev infra... renting costs balls :p

[27-Mar-19 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
should do the same with NN and just buy it

[27-Mar-19 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah that 3k5 upfront would have saved 1 year of renting

[27-Mar-19 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
but in the same time renting gives flexibility

[27-Mar-19 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah cant really move now, even though high counts may demand that üò¶ Still rather decentralize the netwok.
