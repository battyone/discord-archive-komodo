I don't have change nick privileges on this server, could someone set me to "jackson"?

[15-Jun-18 06:21 AM] Jax#4739
Also, is the process for switching physical hosts as streamlined as it should be? I'm looking at moving from my current setup (which is actually a high-end VPS) to a dedicated, co-located server. Are there any issues associated with IP address change, etc. that are worth knowing?

the miners wait for the diff to drop, then blast away

[16-Jun-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then since the prior blocks are all GPU, diff doenst start dropping for 50 blocks or so

regarding Syscoin github hack.  In the past we tried to add this coin to our nodes.  I now worry about adding others' code  to our nodes.  Good thing we are not running windows.

[16-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I said that this will happen, and it happened. I think that it would be the best, using different keys for client chains.

its wat too much tbh

[17-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> The main goal of `init_iguana.py` is to get rid of all the bash wrappers in the standard method. Replace them with a single, clear, python script. Decoupling thus the building process from the initialization process.

[17-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> So it's not just about making the operation easier, but also making the current code base better.

[17-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Kind of two convergent yet distinct different goals.

[17-Jun-18 05:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thing is i won t personnaly change bash scripting unless am forced to. I don t see the need of adding a layer with python for something that already works flawlessly

[17-Jun-18 05:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
When we ll have to it will be different. Am very lazy : i see things a different way : the tech and bottlenecks create the need for adaptation. The adaptation is here to follow or serve the needs. Not the opposite. But am a dinosaur lol

[17-Jun-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I see.
The problem with the current architecture (i'm talking about the operational codebase, not iguana itself), is that it wasn't designed to scale, but to just work. If it works, every time, with one click, then it's OK.
Now, if we want to scale, that approach is no longer valid, and we need to be prepared. Putting each part of the process in its own space (module) is crucial to achieve scaling.

[17-Jun-18 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even with 1k chains it is valid. Not "fashion" but no risk at all relying on it.

[17-Jun-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
And before we have this scaling problem we ll have to figure out other things and possibly change the way architecture is done atm.

[17-Jun-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
No problem until there is one :D

[17-Jun-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> When you say ‚Äòscale‚Äô what do you mean?

If it‚Äôs something like autochains from section 3.1 of the verus vision paper (p7 of http://185.25.51.16/papers/VerusVision.pdf). Then there is mention of a provisioning protocol on page 8 do there is Blockchain based ‚Äúspawning‚Äù it reads.

[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> And having to expand to a multi-host setup, each notary node.

[17-Jun-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> In any case, having a clear division between every operational stage is good and desirable, in my opinion. One thing is the core (iguana and komodod binaries), another thing is initialization, another thing is daemon handling, another thing is utxo handling, etc.
Today it's all mixed up; it works, I know, but it is not ideal.
