you don t care on testnet

[19-May-19 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
but beware on mainnet

cleanwallettx does or pool just stops seeing it?

[19-May-19 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
cleanwallettx just deletes it from listunspent

[19-May-19 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
before it s available to send

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I have to sync a 1.7gb wallet.dat to get a few kmd back

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I don t deport the mining)

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I noticed that on my pool, it listed them all as orphans, but was under time crunch and didn't investigate

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
good to know that

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
here again, not a word of trust

[19-May-19 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
but you will deal with easymining, now, notary friends

[19-May-19 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
looping every 15 min

[19-May-19 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
will make you potentially lose all mining rewards xD

[19-May-19 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
not lose

[19-May-19 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
just not "see"

[19-May-19 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you keep a synced mining wallet separated it s ok

[19-May-19 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
just be warned if you do allinone, you ll have to make frequents resync to grab a few utxos back

[19-May-19 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
on a separate node ofc :troll:

[19-May-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe use a "master" node on a vm that has needed keys and never gets cleaned on cron without consolidation?

[19-May-19 09:28 PM] Decker#3767
@Deleted User btw, just for your knowledge ... you don't need to wait to resync all chain and wait all txes to be in wallet just for get some "forgotten coins". if you using resetted wallet and need to access some forgotten funds before reset - you can follow two ways:

1. use explorer API to get unspent outputs and construct spending tx manually.
2. just parse LevelDB database to get your utxos and construct tx from this data.

i have a plan to write a separate app or script which will help to do this automatically.

[19-May-19 09:29 PM] Decker#3767
bcz rescan wallet from scratch after a year of notarisation is very looooooong process.

[19-May-19 09:30 PM] Decker#3767
and more than 1 Gb wallet.dat for kmd is slooooow anyway.

LABS lottery for the two additional NN spots is ending in ~3 hours(1558320334)

[20-May-19 12:32 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Hey gang. Still got my testnet NN running, given thought  to beginning prep work for full KMD NN.. Didn't want to stop my testnet node if continuing running is beneficial to the team.. Thoughts?

[20-May-19 12:33 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
also, slight confusion, will I need to use same pubkey where I received votes on testnet for mainnet NN?

[20-May-19 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
I've been thinking about this as well. Do we want to maintain this network?

[20-May-19 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
LABS will have a separate iguana network for CFEK shortly, we could transition to this

[20-May-19 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
no reason we can't keep this running, just saying my focus will shift from this testnet to the CFEK network

[20-May-19 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
CFEK is "clusterfuck", an iguana testnet and testnet fungible cluster for LABS

[20-May-19 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can fully commit to continuing until Sept 1, beyond that would depend on markets (can if KMD stays over $1.10 after then)

[20-May-19 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
there's no reason to "commit" though, it's a testnet

[20-May-19 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
it'll run without you. It's only useful to people testing things

[20-May-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, it needs minsigs (whatever that is) participants

[20-May-19 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
so change them

[20-May-19 12:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just putting it out there that I can do x
if others can do x, y, or z and also state so, then we can formulate a plan

[20-May-19 12:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and yes, I'm well aware that crypto functions without me 😛

[20-May-19 12:44 AM] Alright#0419
we can do a poll on TXSCLCC 🤷

[20-May-19 01:46 PM] cipi#4502
lol ... i like that license

really? let it come. i have over 500

[20-May-19 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
would be a good test to see if that is enough. if not, will increase that for the future

[20-May-19 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@NNoperator thanks for the heads up

[20-May-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
i have 1x 100 utxo split tx unconfirmed from 2 hours ago

[20-May-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007

If there is a consensus I’ll keep my testnet up. Have it turned off right now.

[20-May-19 04:32 PM] phm87#7395
I will keep my testnet NN setup at least until beginning of mainet and maybe later (I need a test environment)

Around 2 hours after the announcement, not bad 😅

[21-May-19 02:56 AM] Strob#3417
Does anyone have any idea why d0ct0r has no BEER and I have no TXSCLCC? I tried everything I could think of. My loss of TXSCLCC was triggered by some downtime around 5 days ago. then I tried many things: reindexing, zapping wallet, reseting wallet, cleanning wallet, rebooting many times, deleting everything in myTXSCLCC forlder and reconstructing it. And since 3 days and a half I have been doing nothing just to see if the stochastic Iguana process will just randomly choose me again one day. All without success. I could just wipe my hard drive and rebuild my node from scratch but I would like to know what's the bug... 🤔

[21-May-19 02:58 AM] Strob#3417
What is the maximum of days I should wait without any notas until we can say something is really not working as it should?

[21-May-19 03:43 AM] Strob#3417
By splitting with Decker's script

I use the same for PIZZA and BEER

[21-May-19 04:31 AM] Mylo#8306
decker's script uses iguana, if  the coin hasn't been activated (wallet loaded, whatever the terminology is) - it won't split.

[21-May-19 04:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I just realise my name was left out of the official email for newly elected notaries aha. The southern hemisphere only lists the top 7!

[21-May-19 05:11 AM] Mylo#8306
ah damn..... i'll pass it on.

@webworker01 Please tell me more about those files ending in 7776 I didn't run them manually. when should we execute them?

[21-May-19 11:09 AM] phm87#7395
I did not receive any email. @NutellaLicka what email ?

[21-May-19 11:09 AM] Strob#3417
If I execute TXSCLCC_7776 I get {"result":"coin already there","tag":"6185625597598235028"}

[21-May-19 11:12 AM] Strob#3417
I got notas for TXSCLCC for the whole testnet. It just stop after the election when I had to stop notarizing for some maintenance (changing router and server).

[21-May-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Strob when cleaned up, the BEER one looks like this: <https://pastebin.com/FphMVLjB>

[21-May-19 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when should we execute them?`
they can be used to add the coin (line 12) to iguana (and mm too iirc)

[21-May-19 11:16 AM] Strob#3417
Ok they are the same as line 58-60 in m_notary_testnet

[21-May-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
So who broke their BEER on testnet?

[21-May-19 02:19 PM] Strob#3417
BEER was always working for me, only TXSCLCC got broken.

[21-May-19 02:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, it's been almost 4 hrs since a notarization, so that means that less than minsig have the chain properly working

[21-May-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
HIGHLY recommended reading for NN ops, about privacy and who you are protecting yourself from.  
Goes into extensive detail about tools uncovered by Snowden and other recent updates: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch2-May16.pdf

[21-May-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
that chapter of that book is probably the best summary of all that stuff I have seen

[21-May-19 02:47 PM] jorian#4555
First 9 pages are frightening already

[21-May-19 02:47 PM] jorian#4555
Does it really have 24+ chapters?

[21-May-19 03:23 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks

[21-May-19 03:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
old news.. is the full book posted there?

[21-May-19 03:38 PM] Strob#3417
@webworker01 Ok yes then there are all activated everytime we run m_notary_testnet that contains the same curl commands

[21-May-19 03:40 PM] Strob#3417
Important to check yes. When I run it manually for TXSCLCC it says already added

[21-May-19 03:46 PM] Strob#3417
Because I have a cron job that keeps them low.

[21-May-19 03:47 PM] Strob#3417
I checked it, no locked

[21-May-19 03:47 PM] Strob#3417
How much did you keep for the textnet?

[21-May-19 03:51 PM] Strob#3417
mmmh... everyone seemed to agree that the default was too high and we should keep the utxo count the lower possible iwthout ever going to zero....

[21-May-19 03:52 PM] Strob#3417
I will set it higher to see if it makes any difference

[21-May-19 04:22 PM] zatJUM#9924

for some reasons BEER notarization stopped for 4 hours

[21-May-19 04:24 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`bestmatches` stuck at 0 during every rounds

@Strob have you resynced the chain?

[21-May-19 07:45 PM] Strob#3417
Yes. At one point I deleted everything in the TXSCLCC folder and resynched it etc

[21-May-19 07:47 PM] Strob#3417
I just rebooted and my BEER and PIZZA got nota very fast after reboot but no TXSCLCC
