It must difficult to see if it really makes a difference cause yesterday for no reason my notarization became faster for a while then went back to 1 every 10 minutes

[31-Mar-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It takes a very very long time to measure anything definitavly yes. Look at a-team, 9th in SH for whole year, today is 1st 🤣

I regreted buying this highpoint raid card and 2 x 960 pro M.2 drives cause in my workstation it didn't make that much a difference and we can't boot from it. We need to buy the new v2 to be able to boot

[31-Mar-19 01:46 PM] Strob#3417
So I will try if it can be on any use in a NN or else I will put it on ebay!

[31-Mar-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol any nvme will be fine IMO.

[31-Mar-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
yes @mrlynch  software raid 0. And backup on a regular drive

[31-Mar-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
strange.. i have nvme on my workstation as main drives and boots fine

[31-Mar-19 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe it's the raid card?!

[31-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Strob#3417
Yes I am booting on a single Nvme drive too. It's the raid card yes that doesn't support booting

[31-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Strob#3417

There is probably a hack somewhere to make it boot (I saw someone claiming he could boot on it in his mac but didn't find anything for linux or windows yet)

[31-Mar-19 01:53 PM] Strob#3417
Anyway if I put my home on the nvme all the blockchain data will be on the nvme and the os on the ssd, maybe it's beneficial too to have the os and data on separate drives.

[31-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, 100% do that. its a life saver

[31-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I used a /mnt for data drives

[31-Mar-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then symlink to `~/.komodo`

[31-Mar-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if OS gets killed dont need to sync all chains to get back up, also keep backup of OS. So can resume notarizing asap

[31-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Strob#3417
Yes i saw about simlinking to move softawares even after installation linux is really handy for that! You can also update the os without reinstalling all the softwares

How much ram max is the real net using?

[31-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I ditn worry about it for github clones, but for blockchina data its really useful. Get you nodes OS setup, then take an image of it. Any time it may get broken just restore it. I also used vmware ESXi so can make lots of drives. Easily attach a storage drive to another VM. 😃

[31-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My notary is using atm 40GB

[31-Mar-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its using custom iguana, without that iguana its using over 50GB most of the time

[31-Mar-19 02:03 PM] Strob#3417
ok wow ram hungry! Almost like fluid simulation!

[31-Mar-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just leaks memory, I seem to have fixed it, but needs more tests.  running 50 coin daemons is where most of the use comes from though.

[31-Mar-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I expect that only to increase more and more over time.

[31-Mar-19 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
128GB DDR3 server here, was very cheap, plenty of room

[31-Mar-19 02:05 PM] Strob#3417
Yes better have 128!

[31-Mar-19 02:07 PM] Strob#3417
I have 3 workstation with 96MB of ram for fluid simulation but my servers only have 64 or 24. But I can upgrade them ram is not that expensive anymore I guess since the class action lawsuit against price fixing. Did you get your money back from the lawsuit?

[31-Mar-19 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
umm no. I got a second hand server with the 128GB ram in it for liek $1300 without storage drives lol.. Its like the last Athlon64 based chips ever made.

don t overbuy servers as of now, we don t have infos but we will need to provide **2 pubs**

[31-Mar-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
VM's 😄

[31-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
if we reach 64gb ever, I think if the decision is already made to split

[31-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
we know that maybe 2 64 gb will be far cheaper but also needed

[31-Mar-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think with more work iguana can use even less mem... RAM shouldnt be an issue unless we have hundreds of coins.... in which case 2 server/VM will be required

hopefully we will know if my iguana can run an entire network on its own by end of this week. LABS still has -26 errors from somehow mixin up selected utxo between chains.

[31-Mar-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem problem on mainnet with 4-5 nodes using, or on this testnet with just me using it.

[31-Mar-19 02:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but LABS may have ppl on buggy versions

[31-Mar-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤞  its good

[31-Mar-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
saves us a lot of money long term

So the faster make 1 notarization every 12 minute (it's a 25 hours variation)

[31-Mar-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats just about all of them

[31-Mar-19 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we have seen this pattern before I think... but it should even out over time.

[31-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Strob#3417
So the speed seams the same I guess variation comes from restart or other idle time.

[31-Mar-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really. Those guys probably have full servers not small VPS. Im using 2 core 4GB in Australia lol.

[31-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Strob#3417
Yes I guess you can be slower than 1 every 15 minutes but maybe you can't be faster than 1 every 10 minutes

[31-Mar-19 03:09 PM] CrisF#3405
I was down for about an hour today. Seemed to lose som speed, haha.

[31-Mar-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also more coins makes a massive diffrence... once you start loading it up...

[31-Mar-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
uptime without a restart... is very good... My SH a-team is destroying today after 2-3 days after restart.

[31-Mar-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the official guide was to stop iguana when upgrading daemons... once I worked out you didnt need to do that... it helped a LOT

[31-Mar-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r It wouldn't confuse me as much except for the fact that this is literally the server I used for LABS

[31-Mar-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah does 100% of nodes have your pubkey already, and after another day the data will be more valid.

[31-Mar-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nodes form groups of best mates when the network is unstable

[31-Mar-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[31-Mar-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
utxo on KMD min 10, max 25. 
AC min  5, max 10. 
clean wallet, dont restart.  That should be optimal on testnet, if that doesnt work try my or labs iguana. 
noramlly after a change a week of testing with 100% uptime was needed to say yay or nay. 
At least for changes that make nano seconds of diffrence.

[31-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I probably should drop KMD a bit, I've got it set for 150/30 (25 spent too much time making txes when we had more than 5 chains)

[31-Mar-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
generally less is better... although with labs iguana it selects them diffrently... It just picks one randomly assuming there is only iguana utxo and the split utxo in the wallet.

[31-Mar-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So you can run a few more there I gues... I just use the lowest safe amount and that selection 😄

[31-Mar-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is just glad he isn't dealing with 4-5 other assetchains that his wallets have like 8k-60k UTXOs :P_

I haven't consolidated several of them

[31-Mar-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It has a very specific function... Took me ages to describe it easily.
`deletes any spent utxo deeper in the chain than the last unspent`
so dont let some stray utxo sit around for 1000 blocks, send it

KMD is the most important. running 2 nodes on the same server with 100 connections each actually helps quite a lot, best if open ports, pll connecting to you rather than forcing out is much better. 
uses shit laods of bandwidth though.
