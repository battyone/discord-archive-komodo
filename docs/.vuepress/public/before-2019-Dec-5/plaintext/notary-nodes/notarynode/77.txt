it is the site that doesn't update or the last btc notarization was at 2019-03-31 20:50 UTC ? https://notarystats.info/notarizationsbtc.php

[03-Apr-19 12:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not actualy much of a problem... as the notarization on the target isnt that important...

[03-Apr-19 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
privided those tx dont go missing that is

[03-Apr-19 12:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as they are eventually confirmed

`not actualy much of a problem... as the notarization on the target isnt that important...`
thanks for the details, that's what I was wondering

[03-Apr-19 12:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like its important as in if it wasnt there... then dpow isnt as strong...But the reorg protection is done by the source chains notarization tx

Hey, I'm setting up a NN using this guide https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Setup-Komodo-Notary-Node except I've specified `testnet=1` in komodo.conf but for the testnet only I get the following error ```shell
$ ./komodo/src/komodod

call komodo_args.(./komodo/src/komodod) NOTARY_PUBKEY.()

about rpcport, should they also be opened in the firewalls or better not?

[03-Apr-19 02:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob super no

[03-Apr-19 02:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
RPC is private, like your backdoor

only p2p ports need firewall rules

[03-Apr-19 02:52 AM] Strob#3417
Ok. thanks ! so in your case do you at least open p2p ports on only iguana and ssh?

[03-Apr-19 02:52 AM] Strob#3417
ok cool that's what I did

[03-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Strob#3417
But I still can't figure out why I have less peer that others

[03-Apr-19 02:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
open a port for every service that is needed, iguana and every full node

[03-Apr-19 02:54 AM] Strob#3417
iguana and the p2p port of each asset right

[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@gt looking at that repo, it seems to be missing some steps.  Starts with `Start PIZZA, BEER, TXSCLCC and KMD daemons with -pubkey=` I dont have those daemons yet, the KMD one was the one I was having trouble syncing to testnet.

[03-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Strob#3417
PIZZA, BEER & TXSCLCC are KMD asset chains you just start them by adding -ac_name=BEER for example

[03-Apr-19 03:19 AM] Greer#0666
yup, but didn't get the Komodo daemon on testnet yet.  having this issue https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455755767132454913/562828489430925325

[03-Apr-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
./src/fiat

[03-Apr-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
`cd src;  ./fiat/beer getinfo`

[03-Apr-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
use `./fiat/coin` it will save you typing and time and typos

[03-Apr-19 03:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
./src/assetchains starts them all

[03-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Strob#3417
You don't have to add testnet=1

[03-Apr-19 03:22 AM] Greer#0666
ah, ok.  Thats the part I screwed up thanks!

[03-Apr-19 03:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
and ./src/assetchains.old has all the CLI commands in a very useful form that you will want to see and use sometimes, but that is no longer the canonical source of info, that is assetchains.json

hopefully that is a useful lesson for the day, very important info for NN ops

[03-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Strob#3417
It's not on a testnet it's notarizing BEER, PIZZA and TXSCLCC for real but those coinsare dummy coins used only for testing.

[03-Apr-19 03:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
and testnet=1 is very rarely used in KMD world, we just spin up new chains

[03-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Greer#0666
I did this last year, the penny dropped on that as soon as you pointed out no testnet=1

[03-Apr-19 03:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
we do have regtest mode, I made sure that worked and hopefully continues to work

[03-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Greer#0666
anybody do this on k8s yet?

[03-Apr-19 03:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
some people use docker, haven't heard of k8s used, but who knows. NN ops are quite enterprising

I wouldn't consider using k8s unless you want to fix some really low level bugs in various pieces of software and kernel

[03-Apr-19 03:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
a safe version of docker is probably safe

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] Greer#0666
k8s is kubernetes, a way of orchestrating docker containers

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
but hey, I like simplicity in life

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
I understand

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
Bare docker = good. k8s = bad

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] Greer#0666
oh, sorry, I misread

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
k8s has crazy kernel bugs in networking layer in some latest releases according to above bug report

[03-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
which break shite

[03-Apr-19 03:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's really nice to see a lot of new potential NN ops who are motivated and skilled
