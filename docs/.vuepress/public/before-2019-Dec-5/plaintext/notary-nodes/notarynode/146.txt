`if I was elected`? Why not "in order to provide services that justify me getting elected"?

[17-Apr-19 03:23 AM] Greer#0666
@blackjok3r part of what I'm talking about is utxo management, as it turns out its quite simple, just didn't understand why what was required.  I never once said complete guide.

[17-Apr-19 03:23 AM] VoskCoin#1869
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator theres a difference between spoon feeding and simply having complete guides, it shouldnt be too hard to judge someones motivation after some interaction

[17-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Greer#0666
@blackjok3r yes Labs is perfect and I only just found out about that by chance

[17-Apr-19 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all you whineing about utxo management have me to blame... before I worked out that it gave an extremly large advantage .... we didnt ahve to do it 😄

[17-Apr-19 03:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User If my dumb ass can read a shell script and understand it, it's not "hard" for someone with "intimate knowledge of linux and server security"

[17-Apr-19 03:24 AM] VoskCoin#1869
I see it a lot w/ miners, you get the guy who says what should I mine? with what? why? etc then you get the guy who says I ran x y z numbers, I set this up and I like this, however X is not working even after trying 1 2 3

[17-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Greer#0666
bit late now, and thats partly on me.  I searched labs a few days ago when it was mentioned, didn't see much that relates.

[17-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Greer#0666
I've spent at least 8hrs per day for the past 14 days, I know how much time it takes.

[17-Apr-19 03:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Asking on discord is a great way to learn. So is LABs. There are some docs, but the rate of change can make them obsolete rapidly.

LABS been dead for weeks though sadly.. the people whop were there to help make it learnt the most.

[17-Apr-19 03:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Basiccaly it is a daily commitment to keep up to date with whats happening.

[17-Apr-19 03:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and talking to those that made it happen

[17-Apr-19 03:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S. anyone crying about what we tested in labs can use the search box and see every bit of conversation (it's one of the main reasons we left slack for discord) - literally all the way back to the creation of PoS on Komodo

[17-Apr-19 03:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
from there, if someone writes docs that others can grasp, power to them.

[17-Apr-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I said, getting a node "up and working" is easy as pie... makeing it go fast is another matter

its like travelling the frontier. if you dont get out of the wagon, you wont know where you are.

[17-Apr-19 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If it wasnt for the  "get the most notarizations rule" I never would ahve bothered to make everything go faster... but those are the rules. 🤷

[17-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Greer#0666
I am neither crying or whining.  I'm pointing out that kmd have a very important task that needs informed op's.  docs (not idiots guides or step-by-steps) would benefit kmd

[17-Apr-19 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I feel its only fair to share how to make it go faster... even ios that seems to confuse the situation.

it’s been stated that NN ops ought to have technical skill at this time more than other points. technical skill comes from doing more so than reading (research can definitely help though). you can get that here in testnet or LABs. Docs will come and things will eventually get more streamlined

[17-Apr-19 03:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
docs cant speak to you either. good for basics, beyond that talk to your local notary

[17-Apr-19 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181

CG, that guide isnt' for testnet, not close and its literally what an op doesn't need.  I dont need you to tell me how to compile bitcoin core.  I need to know why I need bitcoin core to start with.  (I know that, but not all would and it should be documented for potential ops).

` I need to know why I need bitcoin core to start with.`
Then you need to read the whitepaper and learn what Komodo is/does 🤦🏽

[17-Apr-19 03:37 AM] Greer#0666
as I said, I read the whitepaper and I did know that part, but there are aspects not documented in the wp that are critical to running a nn

[17-Apr-19 03:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how things work.` Is something you should know **before** you decide to kick somone out of a job that already knows how it works

[17-Apr-19 03:38 AM] Greer#0666
people doing the job only know parts

[17-Apr-19 03:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
For testnet - https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/README.md
`assuming komodo installed`
utxo management, scripts etc are various based on previous NN stuff they figured works for them.
participating in discord also helps

I guess that I can manage a server way more efficiently than more than half the ops.

[17-Apr-19 03:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`people doing the job only know parts`
I'm saying that there are 9 people running in EU that know more than the basics already and you're going to boot one of them out because vosk is internet famous

[17-Apr-19 03:39 AM] Greer#0666
devs have done what devs do and made a pretty simple job very messy and complicated.

even with all the time I spent in Labs, my node still goes wierd. I woke up to 3hrs of no ntx on TXSCLCC.

`and keep it notorizing better than those guys in #notary-node-alarms`
given that some of them left 6 months ago, that's not really a brag

[17-Apr-19 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181 (pinned)
Iguana uses the wallet code from BTC (that is in every coin we notarize) 
In short this code is terrible and slow and inefficiant. 
`time komodo-cli listunspent > /dev/null`
you will find with a large number of  utxos, the time for this call far out weighs ping time or any other factor. 
The goal is to make this as fast as you can, while never running out of utxos. 
Iguana starts a round of dpow in a thread, each node is connected directly to each other. 
there is recvmask, which is the first round.  To enter this, you must select and utxo and broadcast it to all your peers.
From this mask, the bestk and bestmask is generated randomly which chooses who notarizes. 
 The goal is to respond to enough peers fast enough that you are always in recvmask, and so have the best chance at being in bestmaks. 
There is nothing else you need to know. How you do this is toally up to you, and everyone aproaching this diffrently is what gets things to work better.

KMD cant do that. I made LABS have -ac_notarypay that pays each notary for each notarization. Cannot be imnplemented in KMD.

[17-Apr-19 03:45 AM] Greer#0666
@Deleted User I know he's talking about them.  My point is they are just as likely to have 'life happen' to them and quit too.  Vosk has a track record and reputation, as do I.  Not in this community, but in a much wider community.

[17-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Greer#0666
I did check in a few months ago, and again several times, saw nothing, left and came back a little late.  As I said, that is on me.

[17-Apr-19 03:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is transferring node when `life happens` an option?

[17-Apr-19 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`You should have come like 3 months before the elections to get all this straight...`
That bit I agree with.
This is like applying for a job in Silicon Valley and saying "before I start, can you teach me everything I need to know for the job I start on Monday, because I'm coming into this with 0 foreknowledge and experience"

politics is fine, doesn't intereste me, I ignore it.  even if vosk stands no chance of getting elected, I made a commitment to learn this and setup a node.  I'm not happy with it just running, I want it running reliably and well.

@Greer If you have the knowledge and experience then why don't you write the docs you want to see instead of groaning that they don't exist?
Or at the very least answer the question I asked 3 times, which is: dafuq is it that you think is missing from the docs?

docs for the notarization part, someone linked a devs guide that appeared to have some of the missing pieces.  internals aren't needed, just concepts, what are the three chains, how do they interact with kmd, why is iguana needed, how are we able to run the kmd daemon several times over with these -ac flags, these are the kinds of things that are important, if not for me and my dumbass youtuber friend, for 2020 ops and 2025 ops...

[17-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Greer#0666
the official docs shows how to build, step by step commands, no op should need to see this and its not for testnet.  The testnet repo starts with 'start pizza, beer, txsclcc'..... at what point was it made clear wtf pizza and beer have to do with anything, let alone how and why you start them.
