trying to do it around the same time each day

[01-Apr-19 02:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh ok, gotcha

[01-Apr-19 02:25 AM] Strob#3417
What are the nodes we are adding when launching PIZZA  (78.47.196.146) , BEER (78.47.196.146) and TXSCLCC (54.36.126.42 and 94.130.224.11) ?

[01-Apr-19 02:29 AM] Strob#3417
Here are my peers: KMD=16

[01-Apr-19 02:29 AM] Strob#3417
PIZZA =16

[01-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Strob#3417
BEER = 16

[01-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Strob#3417
TXSCLCC = 8

[01-Apr-19 02:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Strob maybe also send funds to self in case utxos locked

[01-Apr-19 02:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm still 3hrs since last pizza ntx, just did that too just in case

[01-Apr-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC sendtoaddress RXhapCShoqNeWytLXeWR2wX7m5xfNYfxNx $(./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC getbalance) "" "" true` 
Change the adddress. You cant split mined utxos

[01-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Strob#3417
I just got another notarizxation . i just restarted the server and all .

[01-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Strob#3417
thanks guys

[01-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Strob#3417
I think it was due to some update I didn't get last time, 1 file was changed from the repo.

[01-Apr-19 02:42 AM] Strob#3417
It was a second TXSCLCC that I just did

[01-Apr-19 02:44 AM] Strob#3417
my last üçï was at 3 pm! My server is hungry!!!

[01-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Alright#0419
@CHMEX when I clicked last 12hr on the testnet stats page, I'm not shown

[01-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Alright#0419
https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RA5UJWSvSTx3oVEpUf9716MtbLiknX4QNG
definitely have notarized in the last 12 hours

[01-Apr-19 03:03 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I need to tweek it a bit and show the 0 values ( for Pizza in your case I think)

[01-Apr-19 03:05 AM] Strob#3417
In my log I see this: [3] notarize PIZZA->KMD 001eaeeb3b3b729eb62f47eb63760aac7a5cca0051f7ee48304ad4663c8661c6 ht.68738 minsigs.5 duration.300 start.1554087437 MoM[12] 77de3e07a415dfc8cb933234b8cff71f532f03495c53e17659685bbf427efd33 CCid.0

[01-Apr-19 03:06 AM] Strob#3417
When I go to that blockhash I see this: http://pizza.explorer.dexstats.info/block/001eaeeb3b3b729eb62f47eb63760aac7a5cca0051f7ee48304ad4663c8661c6

[01-Apr-19 03:07 AM] Strob#3417
Is this a notarization or not? And I don't see any notarization on my pizza address

[01-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Strob#3417
I see I have locked utxo in komodo after stopping agama, how can I unlock them?

[01-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
look at m_notary_testnet @Strob

[01-Apr-19 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
there's bash line for it

[01-Apr-19 03:22 AM] Strob#3417
ok cool thanks got it!

[01-Apr-19 03:23 AM] Strob#3417
komodo-cli lockunspent true `komodo-cli listlockunspent | jq -c .`

[01-Apr-19 03:23 AM] Strob#3417
So the command to unlock them is lock them!? lol

[01-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Strob#3417
It worked!

[01-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Apr-19 04:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you write a script that is more intuitive.

Maybe one day! I'm not a that level yet. üôá

[01-Apr-19 04:22 AM] Strob#3417
Now I'm trying to understand how I should do the git stash in order to modify the main.c file to set iguana in nosplit mode. I deleted ~/2019NNtestnet/agents/iguana , uncommented the nosplit line 2203 in main.c, then I did git stash, then I ran m_notary_testnet but  my change just got overriden and iguana started in autosplit mode.

[01-Apr-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I dont usually bother with stash... if you edit a file locally and your nmot commiting anything ... then it should leave your edit there, unless the git pull edits that exact paret of the code

[01-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Strob#3417
ok I'll try again

[01-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Strob#3417
tx

[01-Apr-19 04:28 AM] Strob#3417
I guess I should comment out the git pull in m_notary_testnet or my changes will be overriden?

[01-Apr-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they should not

[01-Apr-19 04:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
git will only pull the actual changes

[01-Apr-19 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so unless someone has uncommented or commented that line in the latest commit ti wont touch it

[01-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Strob#3417
ok cool

[01-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r having edited files seems to make git pull not actually pull

[01-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
or am I crazy?

[01-Apr-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont let you push

[01-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Alright#0419
man if I'm wrong about that, I've wasted a lot of time editing things

[01-Apr-19 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive been running local edits on many rpos for a long time never had any problem unless pulling down an update that edited the same line

[01-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
has anyone not gotten any notarizations since TXSCLCC was added?

[01-Apr-19 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[01-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
I know Cris hasn't

[01-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
wondering if anyone else is the same

[01-Apr-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Look testnet is unreliable.,.. your constantly chaging pubkeys

[01-Apr-19 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the thing is bound to be broken most of the time until you stop adding keys. Just stop wasting time on it

[01-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Strob#3417
I had only2 notarization

[01-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Strob#3417
Adding the TXSCLCC fecked up my setup it seems

[01-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling the people who are notarizing don't have all of the latest pubkeys or something

[01-Apr-19 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hold on I'll check my node again

[01-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Alright#0419
Need a single notarization so it'll print the prints I added üò´

[01-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Alright#0419
waiting a long assss time now

[01-Apr-19 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I manually added txsclcc to coins and dpow call and pulled the json from git and started it ... notarized all chains withing 30mins

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the m_notary_testnet is wrong ?

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean I didnt use it and manually added the new chian

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Alright#0419
take a look at it?

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what I'd be looking for

[01-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Strob#3417

[01-Apr-19 04:38 AM] Alright#0419
including KMD?

[01-Apr-19 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no KMd will catach up once it sees some notarizations

[01-Apr-19 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just need to have the same of the follwoing to reach consesnus: 
1) block hash and height
2) MoM
3) MoMoM (this comes from KMD)

[01-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Alright#0419

@metaphilibert I am wondering how to get the webworker01 stats script to work for tesnet.

[01-Apr-19 05:32 AM] metaphilibert#0926
Mostly by commenting lines
Lol just woke up and on mobile

[01-Apr-19 05:34 AM] metaphilibert#0926
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodotools/blob/master/webworker01/stats

when we launch TXSCLCC there are 2 addnode ip  (54.36.126.42 and 94.130.224.11) different from the single ip for pizza and beer (78.47.196.146) but in the m_notary_testnet they all have the same seedipaddr (78.47.196.146). could it be a problem?

[01-Apr-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
seedipaddr doesn't do anything

[01-Apr-19 05:58 AM] Strob#3417
ok

[01-Apr-19 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my node seems also deaded after adding txsclCC

[01-Apr-19 06:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its ntoarizing but not very often. .. I think @SHossain  broke it üòõ

[01-Apr-19 06:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or the dexstats site is broken...

[01-Apr-19 06:04 AM] zatJUM#9924
TXSCLCC broke my poor vps ```$ beer getinfo
