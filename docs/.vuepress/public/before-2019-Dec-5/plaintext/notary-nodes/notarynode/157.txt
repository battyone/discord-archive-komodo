I won't lie to someone who thrust me

[18-Apr-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
yeah ma7555 used oddhome parts but it won't work

[18-Apr-19 09:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@phm87 
Let me ask this in a way that you might understand better....
How functional do you think you'd have been in this test if others hadn't freely shared code with you?

[18-Apr-19 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
We shared... you benefited... and the entire community benefits

[18-Apr-19 09:46 PM] phm87#7395
Unsure that I can do anything without others. But I try to share what I learn here.
I helped yiimp community and I'm still helping a lot (you can check my replies to PR on github and comments)

[18-Apr-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I won't lie to someone who thrust me`
ffs it's not State secrets and I literally just posted a link to it

[18-Apr-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
yeah but last time I tried it, it didn't work and many rpc changes are not done into stratum

[18-Apr-19 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the algo bits aren't rpc

[18-Apr-19 09:48 PM] phm87#7395
bits are mostly a copy from zcash

[18-Apr-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's all that was ever asked for

[18-Apr-19 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[18-Apr-19 09:49 PM] phm87#7395
I don't agree and I don't want to lie to you

[18-Apr-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You don't agree? show me where I asked for more than the algo bits.....

[18-Apr-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ever

[18-Apr-19 09:50 PM] phm87#7395
the difficult part is not to copy paste the algo from the coin to yiimp, it is the easy part. Huge work here is to adapt everything else to suit equihash specificities and zcash rpc

[18-Apr-19 09:50 PM] phm87#7395
if I show you only the algo bits and not the whole rest (about 1000+ lines changes), I think I don't respect you

[18-Apr-19 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Huge work here is to adapt everything else to suit equihash specificities and zcash rpc`
I was going to do that part
I don't know why this is sooooooo hard for you to grasp

[18-Apr-19 09:52 PM] phm87#7395
I tried during months without success (before crackers gave me it), I'm talking about 1000+ lines of code to change

[18-Apr-19 09:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
lol

[18-Apr-19 09:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you have the algo and you need 1000+ lines to clone CoinA into CoinB on a pool, then you're lost
The algo is the hard part

[18-Apr-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
I agree that algo is the hard part

[18-Apr-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
but for yiimp, the algo part is to copy paste the algo from coin daemon to yiimp (if the coin is in c/c++)

[18-Apr-19 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`getbalance` is `getbalance`,`getblocktemplate` is `getblocktemplate`, and `whatever` is `whatever` for damn near every coin on the plannet

[18-Apr-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
except BTC, they like to remove useable shit

[18-Apr-19 09:56 PM] phm87#7395
if it is that easy, I wonder why he changed so many lines

[18-Apr-19 09:57 PM] phm87#7395
my difficulty here is that I don't know an opensource pool that have BTC and equihash so it is difficult to show you (apart from yiimp)

[18-Apr-19 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
here's the real kicker that you seem to ignore....
he had equihash CoinX and wanted someone to code KMD for 1000 KMD
I literally offered to do it for half that for the equihash algo bits
You seem to be on about what isn't the point and ignoring the actual words I type

[18-Apr-19 09:58 PM] phm87#7395
You said that equihash algo is opensource

[18-Apr-19 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my difficulty here is that I don't know an opensource pool that have BTC and equihash `
Besides the one I linked to?

[18-Apr-19 09:59 PM] phm87#7395
and I though you knew that zcash was in c++

[18-Apr-19 09:59 PM] phm87#7395
the one you link doesn't work (for rpc and stratum part)

[18-Apr-19 10:00 PM] phm87#7395
@Mauro  can you give me a hand here ? I'm happy you joined btw

[18-Apr-19 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`(for rpc and stratum part)`
at any point are you going to read the words I type or just keep typing something that has 0 to do with what I said?

[18-Apr-19 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
algo bits as you said can be found on google in few seconds, the code I'm talking about is really inside the coin dameon

[18-Apr-19 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
so yes I don't know what you are talking about

[18-Apr-19 10:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the code I'm talking about is really inside the coin dameon`
So, I can just drag and drop komod/src into a random yiimp folder and I'm ready to go? sweet

[18-Apr-19 10:03 PM] phm87#7395
and change few lines of c++ to c and link the stuff (I'm not sure if yiimp is standard compared to other pool types)

[18-Apr-19 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so yes I don't know what you are talking about`
Because you refuse to read the words I type
I.....wanted......the....algo....bits....for....yiimp...in....the....yiimp.....repository....

[18-Apr-19 10:03 PM] phm87#7395
but about drag and drap, I'll take MTP algo as example:

[18-Apr-19 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'll take MTP algo as example`
again, off-topic

[18-Apr-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
I wanted to try to add it so first I copied all the algo files (usually a crypto folder) into yiimp stratum

[18-Apr-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
no it is not off topic

[18-Apr-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
it is just to explain to you how we do stuff

[18-Apr-19 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"we" use an algo that's not the working algo "we" want to confuse the conversation?

[18-Apr-19 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he had the algo bit in the proper location already and had it properly working
all it needed was a few tweeks

[18-Apr-19 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
anyway I'll prove that the stratum doesn't compile:

[18-Apr-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
it contains CUDA code as I said that should belong to the miner and not the pool

[18-Apr-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
oddhome made a mistake that ma7555 copied

[18-Apr-19 10:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`anyway I'll prove that the stratum doesn't compile`
If it didn't compile, then he wouldn't have had an equihash coin running

[18-Apr-19 10:06 PM] phm87#7395
except if you put a GPU into the pool and add CUDA but I don't think it is correct

we will be selecting the top 13 notaries, preferably ones that are demonstrated years of consistent service. We need 13 multisig signers for the automated gateways CC processing of withdraw. it is a matter to run the chain that has the gateways CC and a small oraclefeed dapp. all the handling is automated, of course there could be some cases where some manual work is needed for dealing with bugs. There isnt any monetary advantage to this, just the honor of being in the top 13. These 13 will safekeep peoples KMD and other coins that create sidechains and gateways CC deposits

[19-Apr-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if you feel you are one of the top 13 of all time, please post here and you will be considered. the selection process will be a judgement call, i guess i will make it in case we have more than 13 volunteers

[19-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jorian#4555
i'd say we go to komodostats.com and get the 13 best individuals

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] newvulcan#4719
My Komodo daemon has hung again, and has resisted attempts at a restart. My DC has said my server has got memory errors, so they want to take it down for a while to repair - just in case this reports any errors in your notary nodes. I'll post when it's back up.

[19-Apr-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
@jorian please describe a metric as to to determine the best individuals when some run one node, others 4, and in between, some both seasons, others just one

[19-Apr-19 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
if the multiple in years is important, then looking at komodostats might not be the best

[19-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jorian#4555
but being in the top at komodostats means that you have been the best for at least 1 season

[19-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jorian#4555
so yes, difficult

[19-Apr-19 10:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How often will these signatories be changed?

[19-Apr-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
permanent for each sidechain/gateways CC msig address

[19-Apr-19 10:04 AM] jorian#4555
that's a pretty long-term commitment

[19-Apr-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why we need the allstar NN. it is always possible to migrate the funds to a new sidechain

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] MadMaX#0593
please include me. madmax_AR not a relected notary node. but you can see my node in the early responders for new komodod, iguana & dpow coins update announcements.

will it act like pub for notaries and depend on a hardfork for key change or is the CC valid forever until switched to another one ?

using /proc/<pid>/cmdline is also an option
