so any large amounts could lead to questions about vote selling

[14-Apr-19 01:33 PM] phm87#7395
it is weird now as I have 26 IP and 27 NN pubkeys ...

[14-Apr-19 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@phm87 i already removed that directly 😃

[14-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
which is not good. best to not do multiple VOTE sending

[14-Apr-19 01:37 PM] phm87#7395
@SHossain  I don't understand : there are 28 entries in testnet.json and 30 in m_notary_testnet
Can we add several IP for one pubkey ? Is it allowed ?

[14-Apr-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
only about 7 ips as seednode is enough in testnet.json file

[14-Apr-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
you can add more in m_notary_testnet

[14-Apr-19 01:39 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you, I didn't know it was allowed to use several IP for one pubkey (1 NN I mean)

[14-Apr-19 01:39 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if it is also allowed on mainet of NN

[14-Apr-19 01:40 PM] SHossain#0007
https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/blob/dev/iguana/elected#L5
mainnet has only 8

I was not talking aboout the nb of seeds but the number of notaries

[14-Apr-19 01:42 PM] phm87#7395
I compared the number of entries in testnet.json and in m_notary_testnet

[14-Apr-19 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
i see now what you mean. probably 2 entries out of 30 is old and the op didn't remove it while doing pr to add new

{Reactions}
👌 

[14-Apr-19 01:43 PM] phm87#7395
I expect the same number of IP in m_notary_testnet (call to addnotary) compared to the nb of notaries in testnet.json

[14-Apr-19 01:43 PM] phm87#7395
ok thank you for the explanation

[14-Apr-19 01:43 PM] phm87#7395
anyway, just for KMD culture, can you confirm that on NN mainet, each notary is allowed to have 1 IP max per NN ?

[14-Apr-19 01:47 PM] SHossain#0007
ops shouldn't run iguana using same pubkey in 2 different server at the same time.
yes, 1 IP per node. better not to change them unless needed for a very good reason.
changing ip in mainnet can lead to to low count for some time as all other nodes needs to recognize your new ip

[14-Apr-19 01:47 PM] phm87#7395
one or two days ago, a NN testnet operator said that he was running 2 iguana but maybe it was a joke

[14-Apr-19 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think it was a test and everyone recommended against it if  i remember correctly

[14-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
I was swapping servers so I did it for maybe 30 minutes

[14-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
It did not cause any problem

[14-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Strob#3417
In fact my speed was really good during that time

[14-Apr-19 01:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
running same pubkey on two different instances means same UTXOs will be locked for notarizations

[14-Apr-19 01:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if both nodes try and get the same utxo locked it might give issues

[14-Apr-19 01:49 PM] SHossain#0007
testnet is for  testing :)
mainnet is more serious as the whole ecosystem depends on NN

[14-Apr-19 01:49 PM] phm87#7395
so the speed is better is we run several instances on different servers if I understand correctly but it is not allowed on mainet

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We should integrate SUQA into this testnet

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] phm87#7395
yes but if rigorous tests cannot be performed on testnet, things might happen on mainet only

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
give the opportunity to testers to add a new external coin and also see if all is good for production setup.

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Strob#3417
I don't know if it really helped the speed I would need to run it for a longer time

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] phm87#7395
ok

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it will bring issues eventually.

[14-Apr-19 01:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not recommended doesnt mean its prohibited, its just that it has been known to cause issues.

[14-Apr-19 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers you need @dukeleto, @blackjok3r  or @Decker to integrate SOQA first into the testnet. then, guides and funds for everyone along with PR

[14-Apr-19 01:51 PM] phm87#7395
not recommanded on testnet but not allowed on mainet if I understand correctly

[14-Apr-19 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not recommeneded anywhere really

[14-Apr-19 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007
running 2 instances with same pubkey will most likely harm your performance

[14-Apr-19 01:53 PM] SHossain#0007
will put your nodes into troubles

[14-Apr-19 01:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
like i said, if both nodes try to lock same utxo for a signature at once, you will get into trouble.

[14-Apr-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you're going to run 2 instances, my recommendation would be different coins on each instance
As noted above, you will have UTXO issues if you share
Adding an extra amount of UTXOs to "avoid" this problem will, in most cases, actually lead to a **slower** result than 1 instance with good management

[14-Apr-19 01:55 PM] phm87#7395
I was thinking about utxo filter to see only half and the other half on the other iguana instance

[14-Apr-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every filter you add makes it slower than no filter

[14-Apr-19 01:55 PM] phm87#7395
indeed

[14-Apr-19 01:56 PM] SHossain#0007
with different set of coins still possibility of problem
the common coin is KMD
like Siu said, what if both instance lock out same KMD utxo for the next notarization of different coins in their server. either one of the notarization will fail or maybe both

[14-Apr-19 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
unless you can program iguana and kmd daemon to work as you intend

[14-Apr-19 01:57 PM] phm87#7395
with the existing wallet filter of blakcjok3r, if we split coins from an external address, we can have 2 sets of utxo for KMD using the existing code

[14-Apr-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the common coin is KMD`
yes, that falls into the issue of making it slower 😛

[14-Apr-19 01:58 PM] phm87#7395
then if using 2 iguana, we should split coins from 2 different addresses

[14-Apr-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not to be picky, but I can think of ways to implement filters that dont slow down anymore with additions (to a limit)

[14-Apr-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
but yes it can be a little bit slower indeed but as it use the existing wallet filter code, the slowlyness can be limited (filter less than 10 utxo)

[14-Apr-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
about the wallet filter of blackjok3r, it doesn't seem to slow down things so much

[14-Apr-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c I'm not saying that it cannot be done, but imo when you add that filter exponentially to 20, 30, 70, 100 different chains, there's bound to be some inherent added latancy

[14-Apr-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is true in some cases there is no avoiding it

[14-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i was taking what you said out of context and finding it to be imprecise, hashtables and more specifically bloom filters give an idea of how to filter more things without slowing down as things stay at constant time

[14-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but to implement that in a multicoin env, you would need a true multiwallet...

[14-Apr-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so not practical

[14-Apr-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In my defense I need more ☕ and was mostly making a blanket statement that should been more clear that I was meaning that some things we do that might work in testnet will not hold true on mainnet and actually be worse results than simple maintenance (similar to a "sample size of one" notion)

all you can do is raise the child, then let it run free and supervise. Reserve discipline for the critical failures.

[14-Apr-19 02:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a slight nudge in the right direction can be ok, but too much poking leads to trouble

[14-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
Do not add additional IPs or remove IPs from testnet.json

[14-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
must have 8 values

[14-Apr-19 02:30 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright  As discussed with SHossain here above, I compared the number of entries in testnet.json and in m_notary_testnet : there are 28 entries in testnet.json and 30 in m_notary_testnet, SHossain replied
``i see now what you mean. probably 2 entries out of 30 is old and the op didn't remove it while doing pr to add new``

[14-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
Yep, probably just old ones left there

[14-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Alright#0419
don't pay much attention to it, doesn't matter

if you want to figure out what the extra ones are, you're welcome to 😛
