I read up on this a bit last week - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Client_Node_Discovery
beyond setting up extra nodes personally with `connect=` pointing to NN, not sure IP hoarding  is possible. Excluding NN IPs ussing `setban` is possible, but not convinced it would be advantageous to the bad actor.

@NNoperator Here's my promise to you because I'm tired of the subject, I'm a miner, and I have the equipment:
After May 10, you will personally burn through the exact same amount of UTXOs on ACs if all of the notary nodes carry 51100 UTXOs or someone splits them every 5 minutes.

Slightly off topic, but my mining pool server now has pirate, zaddex and hush working, just komodo to do, which is proving a stubborn whatsit and I'm not 100% sure why, but I'll figure it out. Oh and if anyone is interested it also works with Buck - tbh that was just to see if I could get it to work, what I'm going to do with 1,000,000 of them I don't know !

[26-Apr-19 08:44 PM] SHossain#0007
what issue you are having with KMD pool @newvulcan ?

[26-Apr-19 09:21 PM] newvulcan#4719
@SHossain continuous re-join messages in knomp. It's the only one that does it

[26-Apr-19 09:27 PM] newvulcan#4719
Will do, thanks. For the moment I've pushed my mining rigs back to pirate as I'm beating the odds and pulling a block every few hours - probably won't last for long, I'll have a look at KMD over the weekend

[26-Apr-19 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
re-join messages are ok to ignore as far as i undertood

[26-Apr-19 09:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
ignorable right after a block find, other times it's likely an issue

[26-Apr-19 09:33 PM] SHossain#0007

when double notas happen, it seems to me that NN are split into 2 group https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455755767132454913/570237336722604033

[27-Apr-19 09:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm pretty sure that will be the case, BEER is the onyl chaion having problems, and its not actually using the notarizations, it ignores them

[27-Apr-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
well shit, I still want to change min sigs to 6 or 8

[27-Apr-19 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
so if I see a 7 sig notarization, I can know it's a problem immediately

[27-Apr-19 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can change sigs, but doing BEER dpow at he same time is a very good test to see if these "double notas"goaway

[27-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
ok no change then

[27-Apr-19 09:42 AM] PHBA2061#2530
BEER doesn't have dpow ? so that explain why "notarizedhash" & "notarizedtxid" are all 0, I was wondering about that all the time, now that makes sense

ok. need to make PR to dev. np its a single line of code

Need to wait for jl to merge it.

[27-Apr-19 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changing min sigs is also a good idea to seperate nodes who update and who dont

[27-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Alright#0419
wait until 3pm UTC?

[27-Apr-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how long is that from now?

[27-Apr-19 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its merged now to dev branch

[27-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Alright#0419
well I'll still change sigs at 3pm UTC

[27-Apr-19 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and i'll still be here then no doubt only jsut started work at 5PM lol

[27-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Alright#0419
might it cause a problem if people rebuild prior to that?

there are many that are suspiciously close together

[27-Apr-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
not exactly a definitive indication that it's happening though

[27-Apr-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no, the only way to know for sure is to get the actual block hash from each notarisation then compare if he same one is in 2 or more txns

[27-Apr-19 10:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think any RPC call exists to gtet that kind of data, but I could make it pretty fast, no need for it to be merged anywhere. if your that worried about it I can do it though

are the block hashes the same?

[27-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
look at komodostats decode

[27-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
same data

[27-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
different txs

[27-Apr-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
technically is doesnt actually matter, which ever tx is included in the block first si the one that is used.

[27-Apr-19 10:05 AM] NNoperator#3835
``well we can see which 7 are the problem``  First group has operators: PHBA, Cris, Genie, Popcorn, Tony, Greer     Second group has:  Alright, CHMEX, Strob, gt ...   Do you suspect either group really could have a problem ?     I  am pretty certain these operators are all up to date.

[27-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
well yes but that's not the point

[27-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
could be an indication of another problem @NNoperator

[27-Apr-19 10:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine was definatly not updated, hadnt touched in in a very long time. Ive been away nearly 4-5 days

[27-Apr-19 10:07 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@NNoperator  that what I suspected yesterday as well

[27-Apr-19 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
increase minsigs to like 60% of all ndoes and see if nota stops dead

[27-Apr-19 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that will defintavly answer if there is some connection problem

[27-Apr-19 10:09 AM] PHBA2061#2530
^ same thought here,

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] NNoperator#3835
It seems the groups stick together too.

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] gt#2812
the groups change from my observations

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I noticed that when double notas happened, ususally half of the NN `bestk` are -1, and half of the `recvmask` & `bestmask` are 0

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it indicates that recvmask is diverging

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
some nodes are so much faster than others, that it splits the network into 2

[27-Apr-19 10:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@gt  that is also true from my observation

[27-Apr-19 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Same here.

[27-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so increase minsigs to some stupid number... and see if it stops working... if it does you have the answer

[27-Apr-19 10:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not that nodes create their bestmask with each other... they create the recvmask with each other then you generate 2 diffrent best masks.

[27-Apr-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will see that there are terrible nodes that exist that are so slow they hardly respond at all, and they still occasionaly notarize because enough node just saw them to get a random chance to enter bestmask

[27-Apr-19 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least this is my understanding of how it works, I could be wrong but from a lot of ovbservation this seems to be the case.

[27-Apr-19 10:13 AM] CrisF#3405
So we need an update of Komodo as well this time?

[27-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
seems that isn't the problem

[27-Apr-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
but might as well

"crazy"?

[27-Apr-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will help, but may not be the only iussue/. 60% of all nodes online

[27-Apr-19 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot split into 2 that way

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
if it's slow nodes like you suggest, how does that help?

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
51% would suffice

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] NNoperator#3835
I looked at this double nota  and saw the same grouping  https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/block/0048d7ab5018b24b2ec4189781da0c67ef21011c00a11a9558725c0ba4c31c54

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
it will just slow down overall

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will stop everything working

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so then you know what it is

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you really beleive its a problem, this is how you test it

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling it will continue to work, but slow down

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the group change overtime, but they stick together for a long period

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
just doing it slowly

[27-Apr-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is normal behaviour

[27-Apr-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
some are placed ver close together and some a very very far away... you only need a few nodes with a diffrent recvmask to generate a differing bestmask and it will split things up

[27-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
does this happen on mainnet?

[27-Apr-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once again, longer window for recv would also fisx this "problem"

[27-Apr-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not really there are too many ndoes... but as it doesnt break anything, I doubt anyone really checked it
