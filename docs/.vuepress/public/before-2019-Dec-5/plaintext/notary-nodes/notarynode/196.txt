Closing d0ct0r NN campaign post. Big thanks to all those who have cast votes for me!
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/d0ct0r

The latest and most significant addition made to my proposal reflects redistribution of KMD NN rewards directly to active members of the KMD Discord community. If elected then I pledge 10% (or more! üòâ ) of all of my KMD rewards will be put towards KMD Discord community game prizes, most specifically towards regularly scheduled Discord Chat trivia session winners and host(s).
I am open to suggestions as to just when and with what frequency trivia events will be held. I have seen many formats work, things can become particularly interesting with 'special' guest hosts..
i.e. Math trivia night.. I probably should not be the one to host this particular trivia session üòÅ Seems there are plenty of number crunchers around here who could have a field day with some math trivia / challenges though.
Thanks for all of the support / assistance from so many of you current NN operators! Super cool group here and I hope to become a meaningful part of it for a long time to come!

Thank you for your script @Mylo

[13-May-19 05:17 PM] Mylo#8306
nw, what would be cool is maybe formatting it into json (in "post production") for each node....and graphing it.....somehow by region..... it's already too much data üòÑ

and fyi, vrack is OVH brand

[13-May-19 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
it just can "bend" routes

[13-May-19 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
and latency

[13-May-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
so my way of handling this here will be to provide relays and see if that makes SH nodes stronger

[13-May-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
**not** via main server

[13-May-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause if that works, that would be unfair

[13-May-19 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

Thank you dwy. I don't know if community will agree but I'm happy that discussions occur on how to enhance SH. I don't want to use main NN server (it won't be fair)

have tried hard not to go farther than necessary in troubleshooting this BEER nx issue..

[13-May-19 06:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
IRL, when facing issue that needs prompt fix I'd have gone to greater lengths..

[13-May-19 06:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
as far as launching new VM / starting from scratch rather than nit-picking / band-aiding on and on.. been interesting and valuable learning going the long way

[13-May-19 06:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hope this approach / lack of BEER nx's over past couple weeks in testnet phase doesn't reflect too poorly on me as potential NN operator
