I think the true metric is how consistent you are

[02-Apr-19 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
not your literal counts

it's at least twice as long as it needs to be

[02-Apr-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All you can do is get your node so it responds fast and NEVER RESTART IT! Eventualy it will start working good. 
btw a-team is now 8 days with no iguana restart only 2GB of ram used on iguana.

Seems maybe this iguana build can run for over a month before getting to the same ram use as the official one does in a single week, maybe even 2 months.

`Just want to understand have I adjust something or not`
I know that feeling very well :abusedsmily:

[02-Apr-19 03:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I recon as long as it's doing ok, poking it too much does more harm than good. Restart is a killer.

[02-Apr-19 03:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I've messed myself up with that twice.

[02-Apr-19 03:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
do what you can to make connections higher, and rpc resposes faster. if its a change needing restart, wait until next update and do it then. get ti ready so you're not down for too long

[02-Apr-19 03:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and dont copy paste scripts wih other peoples addresses in them

Check list for testnet:
- Disable auto split 
- Setup some utxo splitter on cron:
-- less than 50 utxo on KMD, less than 20 on AC
- Make sure all p2p ports open
- Make sure iguana port open 
- Make sure there is no firewall on your VPS, closing ports!
- Less important for testnet:
-- Wallet cleaner:
--- cleanwallettransactions RPC will work fine.
--- If not use Deckers reset script first. Then cron the RPC. 
Try to never restart iguana. If you can keep iguana up longer than all other nodes, it becomes a trusted peer or something and just works better.

[02-Apr-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really apart from that there isnt much you can do guys, waiting for your luck to turn 😄

Oh I've not disabled auto split and have 500+ KMD utxos, maybe it is a clue. Will change it on next update so

disableing autosplit on a-team sent me from dead last in SH to 4th consitently

[02-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
should I just disable auto-split by default?

[02-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
Tony look at the pins here for how to disable it

[02-Apr-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well yes, because I cant see why anyone would ever use it

[02-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
well it keeps lazy nodes notarizing

[02-Apr-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
that's a good default behavior I think

[02-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is true, Im not even sure how to merge my iguana upstream whilst keeping autosplit

[02-Apr-19 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Probably going to end up needing two builds... slow and fast 🤣

[02-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
I've found it hard to really tweak the setup with daily updates. Could we start updating every other day if need be?

[02-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
I mean we will reach that point anyway

[02-Apr-19 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think at first we want to add ppl as fast as possible, it wont be that long before there wont be anyone joining then ppl can really start testing optimizations

@Alright autosplit would be good if you could easily change  or override the max utxo and reup params for it. I have a feeling different setups would have different optimal values.

[02-Apr-19 04:17 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
agree it is dangerous for the network to have noautosplit tho, if people might be unexpectedly offline for too long etc.

[02-Apr-19 04:19 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll get a bootstrap up soon.

[02-Apr-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can do that, just need to edit the code... The problem with autosplit is its unrelaible.. it will just stop working for no apaprent reason sometimes

Getting started with Tmux
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer an alternative to GNU Screen. In other words, it means that you can start a Tmux session and then open multiple windows inside that session. Each window occupies the entire screen and can be splitted into rectangular panes.

I was wondering, if the NN candidates with the most votes are not equally  distributed among regions, then what will happen ?
the candidates who run their NN on VPS are allowed to switch region or not ?

14 from EU, 1 from SH (AUS), 4 from NA and 1 from AS (Japan)

[02-Apr-19 06:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that's why I asked that question 😃

idk, I just check based on the ip I found in testnet.json 😃

[02-Apr-19 06:14 AM] TonyL#3577
I set two regions in proposal (EU+AR) but for testnet using EU node because its obv cheaper

@PHBA2061 location where you placed node in testnet not affecting anything connected with voting

That was my plan too, although I thaught about an AR ndoe aswell.. as that should be rpetty easy to get into top... but id have to rent... so I decided against it..
