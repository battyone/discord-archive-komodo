skinny transactions fit into blocks better than fat ones

[23-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
fat txes are more efficient

[23-Apr-19 03:34 PM] NNoperator#3835
60k UTXOs sounds pretty skinny

[23-Apr-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@PHBA2061 if you are asking "how many transactions does it take to fill a block?", it's quite dependent on which coin you are talking about

[23-Apr-19 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
or are you asking "how many xtns could possibly fit in a block?"

[23-Apr-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
it only takes very few very fat transactions to fill a block

[23-Apr-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`"how many xtns could possibly fit in a block?"`
all of them :troll:

[23-Apr-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
on ZEC, you can fill a block with 1 transaction

[23-Apr-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody thought that was a good idea

[23-Apr-19 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
on ARRR it's about 20, iirc

you can get 16x in there if you pretend that the signatures are somewhere else and their data is trasnported by magic

[23-Apr-19 04:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD does not have sapling and the numbers are different

[23-Apr-19 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
DoS'ing via fat xtns is the most financially efficient way to DoS the network, but the dwy attack is "worse" in various ways, and costs a bit more

[23-Apr-19 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
doing both at the same time would be rough times

[23-Apr-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it costs less if you have chickens on your farm

[23-Apr-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
dwy attack is expensive enough that you couldn't do it indefintely

[23-Apr-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
Sapling Woodchipper is so cheap, you could fund it forever with a single Z9, most likely

[23-Apr-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's quite bad

[23-Apr-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the dwy woodchipper

[23-Apr-19 04:32 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@dukeleto  `or are you asking "how many xtns could possibly fit in a block?"`
what I meant is how many utxo could possibly fit in a block, I know that transactions size can vary, but I'm not sure about utxo size, sorry did not clearly express myself 😂

[23-Apr-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the same question

[23-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
4MB blocks

[23-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
2KB per zkproof

[23-Apr-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
74 bytes per signature

[23-Apr-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
p2pk is the most efficient one when it comes to spending

[23-Apr-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so a large sendmany with lots of p2pk outputs as the vin source will allow many tx, especially if they are just using a txfee to send a 1 byte opreturn

[23-Apr-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then each tx would be less than 100 bytes and you could get 40,000 in one block

[23-Apr-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can make 200kb tx and get 20 in a block

[23-Apr-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so your questions is not phrased correctly

fyi i admin pioneers NN and cakeshop is a small dev unit.   cakeshop exists because pioneers can't have liabilities (like software) when they have their own separate businesses etc. (like a DAO that share stuff) - all details on respective proposals.

[23-Apr-19 06:14 PM] Mylo#8306
@Alright no rush with PR, i'm going to bed soon and have to recompile with jl777 branch.
both testnet boxes are on the same physical host, using KVM virt (& virt network shouldn't leave the box, just go through the bridge) if you wanted to test anything to do with close peers

[23-Apr-19 11:42 PM] NNoperator#3835
40 of the 42 IPs come up as 10 hops,  and the others are 8 and 9

I have a favour to ask too. Can the top fastest in the testnet show their .conf. I have very hard time going above 25 not/6 hours (1 not every 17 min or so) since I change my .conf for what you see below. But I think it also concorded with some notaries moving all to Europe to get faster. So now I don't know was it my .conf settings or is really just a matter of location to get faster???

50 CNCT for BEER

[24-Apr-19 02:10 AM] NNoperator#3835
and  you have both ingoing and outgoing,  so that is a good sign

[24-Apr-19 02:12 AM] NNoperator#3835
how many are actual testnet nodes?

[24-Apr-19 02:18 AM] NNoperator#3835
I see my node (another 149. IP)  connected to yours, but I don't see an outgoing connection back to make a duplex.  I notice this in my node as well, all of my connections were one-way.  Only one exception with  one seed node that connected back to my node, while it had accepted a connection from my node.

[24-Apr-19 02:29 AM] NNoperator#3835
One thing I find odd with my BEER connections, is that when I used CG's connector script and I picked up your node along with 10 or so others, some didn't seem to make the connection to port 8922.  I wonder if they are useful connections then?

Maybe @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  knows why this occurs?

[24-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yes

[24-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you seem to have pegged it

[24-Apr-19 02:33 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so odd, at times earlier this week / late last week I was top 10, almost top 5 at times.. No major changes made since then but now these results..

kinda wanna leave it running and wait / see how it looks in morning

[24-Apr-19 02:34 AM] NNoperator#3835
It could be that they are duplicates ?

[24-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I could need to trim peer.dat..

[24-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what progam can I use to mod it though?

[24-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
such generic extension, looks like db which cant be opened in common editors

[24-Apr-19 02:34 AM] NNoperator#3835
