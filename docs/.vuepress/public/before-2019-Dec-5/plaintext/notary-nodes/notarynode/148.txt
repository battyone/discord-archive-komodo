` as he did with Zencash`
That's still a thing? 😕

[17-Apr-19 04:47 AM] Greer#0666
I used that word facetiously.  serious about looking at what he did for zencash

[17-Apr-19 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, if it's genuinely based on accomplishments

[17-Apr-19 04:48 AM] Greer#0666
Zencash became Horizon, you can see what happened when he stopped promoting it.

I'll do it.  If I think I can do a good job. I'll do it.  Not part of any pledge for votes, just because it bothers me and I wasted tonight 'complaining' about it.

I haven't followed this conversation since the beginning, so I don't get the context.

I only saw that there were some comments about "bdex docs aren't docs" or something, and wanted to share before someone invested time in improving dead docs.

`i don't think that mm1/2 has much to do with notary node documentation`

[17-Apr-19 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as I said at least 3 times, iguana isn't just 1 thing, it's at least 15 all in 1

[17-Apr-19 06:15 AM] Mylo#8306
iguana has a stenography api, tx blasting api which can be used for streaming.   and then the other 15 things.  i think it makes burnt toast as well.

[17-Apr-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana is 1000 things... I have been slowly over time removing parts of it that are not needed to notarize, but its a massive undertaking.

[17-Apr-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would almost be eaiser to write a new one.

[17-Apr-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I believe if you update between notarisations you are more likly to do well for the next 24 hours. Also I have seen a reboot on my node did the trick of getting better results. Just my obersations that does not have to be true.
I'm not sure if that is really the reson as in the last 48 hours it did not so good.

When you start the round makes a huge diffrence... One trick is to call each dpow call on iguna with som random delaly of seconds, with lots of chains this does actualyl help (but onyl after restaret) over time it all evens out.

@CHMEX  I noticed that updates can affect my node performance, don't know if it is true for other people, before the 2nd last update my node performance was really good, then it suddenly fell during the 2nd last update, then after the last update it seems back to normal again

so if getting a stable NN setup is too hard given the docs that exist, then likely some out of the blue event would also not be solved

that is a very good point the more different setups and systems are used the more secure it is for the whole network as a single exploit might not work on all system. Mybe at some pint it can run on OSX or even windows....

i woke up hoping to find useful tips or hints, instead i spent 1 hr of my life catching up on bitching and moaning that spoon feeding is not available..

as a n00b in kmd and NN i found the NN setup docs to be quite comprehensive, however 'how to run an efficient nn' would be detrimental in my opinion!
as @webworker01 said this is like SF.. kmd knowledge and getting your way around a linux box should be a requirement! running an efficient node is down to commitment, ability & willingness to learn. from the little time i spent here i observed that a NN has tremendous responsibility which should NOT be taken lightly.

if you're not willing to get in everyone's git, go through code, test, break & improve things and dyor one should not be here <- this has nothing to do with current skills btw

@Deleted User - barriers should not be lowered btw, i'd rather we have high standards to which candidates should aspire to.. one should not seek equality of outcome with 0 input.. put some damn hours into it

`and if he is elected, his server will out perform all of yours, just so I can middle_finger you all next year` talk is cheap.. prove it

OK, I have been reading the conversation about revenue sharings, but I can see that only one approach (the votes buy/sell) has been taken into account. Not everybody offers a revenue share for the same porposes. We wanted to send a message with it saying that we are not in this ellections for profits, as we already own a working infrastructure and after doing some calculations we considered that 50% is enhough for us to mantain the node and thus support the komodo community and its ecosystem.

Holy hell, what a day. Turns out I missed one interesting conversation. If I can throw my two cents in there; this time last year I didn't know how to use Linux.... So there's a bit of transparency for any voters considering me as a NN  😛 
A perceived 'lack of docs' didn't stop me learning all I could through trial & error, along with a massive amount of help from multiple members of the community here who put their time and effort into answering my silly questions along with explaining concepts. I wouldn't be able to do a lot, if it wasn't for the patience of people like @Alright @webworker01 @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @blackjok3r , just to name a few. 
I find it difficult to understand when people come into this community and don't find it easy to integrate into. I believe if you have the right attitude and willingness to learn, test, trial, error, and continue to test, you will struggle . I think that could be translated into anything in life though I suppose.

@jl777c It is a pity that, the only thing of our message that has penetrated has been that 50% of revenue share. Our intention was to present a proposal as honest as possible, with minimal compensation for our informative work and maintenance of the node. Of course, 50% is not the only thing we offer, as it can be read in our application.
