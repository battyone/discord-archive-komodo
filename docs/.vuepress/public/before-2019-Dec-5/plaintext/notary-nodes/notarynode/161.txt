dont use FSM for NN stuff
use dev or beta

[20-Apr-19 05:24 PM] Alright#0419
just felt like tagging people?

[20-Apr-19 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
did you know?

[20-Apr-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
Yes I generally know the status of each branch, when you say we must be on dev I assumed we *needed* something specific from dev

[20-Apr-19 05:29 PM] SHossain#0007
some ops were using different repo and branch. what is wrong with tagging a small group of people to remind of a message if they missed?

[20-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r jl777/FSM branch has the new MoMoM handling that is an iguana hardfork

[20-Apr-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so dev/beta is what to use for notaries

I was on FMS of jl777 btw from the wallet filter merge

[20-Apr-19 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so not on that commit that changed it

[20-Apr-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
updated to dev. which was not much change

[20-Apr-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also reverted some things in my iguana that seemed to break consensus on main net but didnt affect the testnet

[20-Apr-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[20-Apr-19 06:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ports opened? Privkey imported? Correct coin files in iguana folder? Utxo splitted at right size? Iguana running? Komodo has utxo? Etc.

I am on @blackjok3r  repo I will update. Thx

[20-Apr-19 07:16 PM] newvulcan#4719
Just my two peneth. This might not work for you @Lumbi but it works on my install. If I find one of my chains isn't notarizing for a couple of cycles (I base this on the most succesful nodes at that time), then I first consolidate then clean then split. If that doesn't work after another couple of cycles, I kill the daemon for that chain and restart, without reindex (made that mistake once, won't do that again!!). It might decide to verify the chain which can take a while. Once its finished, I found there will be no difference unless I consolidate/clean and split again. Once I've done that it all works..Again it works for me. I managed top stop on the 6hr chart for a short while following that, and up into the top 5 on the 48hr chart. Then I f***** up by restarting KMD, forgetting I had -reindex set, and lost a day !!

[20-Apr-19 07:22 PM] newvulcan#4719
Have to say that because I work for myself and at home all day, I have the ability to keep a very close eye on things, so nothing is as yet automated, which I know is fine for the testnet, but not for the mainnet, so my method here wouldn't work in the real world

[20-Apr-19 07:25 PM] newvulcan#4719
Oh the only time I ever contemplate restarting KMD, is if nothing is notarizing - Fair point its a hammer to crack a nut method, but it works.

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Apr-19 07:53 PM] newvulcan#4719
I know I'm waffling, but here's a good example right now. My notarizing figures on the 6hr chart are 10,59,28 and I'm 6th. Around me I'm seeing figures of 10 for BEER, 20 and 28 for TXS and the odd 59 for PIZZA. So even though the current best performing node is And1-89 with 10,11,20, I'm not going to do anything at this point, as I appear to be notarizing fine, albeit not the fastest. And there you go, 10 minutes or so later, I was right to do nothing, and I'm cycling at the same rate as the current top 4 and up into 5th spot

tau  your proposal mentions NODE  I think you left some of Goldenman's proposal in your copy.  You may want to change your proposal to avoid confusion.

My node went from #4 in the last 12hrs to #20 overnight. Those rotating masks play a huge role obviously. Considering my node is in Aus and is a relatively inexpensive VPS.

Crypto Economy,  looking over your planned server specifications, you will need to opt for SSD to have a competitive node.

If only I could understand this promise maybe I could understand why it was plagiarized....🤔

[21-Apr-19 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
I believe the idea was to distribute a coin called NODE which would be used for revshares

[21-Apr-19 12:45 AM] Alright#0419
basically so you could trade your revshare to someone else I guess

[21-Apr-19 12:47 AM] NNoperator#3835
Similar to REVS

[21-Apr-19 12:48 AM] Strob#3417
REVS? Why not send KMD directly  if you want to share?

[21-Apr-19 12:49 AM] NNoperator#3835
I guess cause it is cool to make your own chain. But somewhat costly if you want it to be backed by dPow

[21-Apr-19 12:52 AM] Strob#3417
Ok so to "maximze" profits they both decided to trash the token and send KMD direclty! So  now I understand the concept but still don't understand why it was plagiarized! Probably just a copy paste mistake!

[21-Apr-19 12:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Trading your revshares from notary node income? Thats one way to make the ecosystem better :)

[21-Apr-19 01:54 AM] NNoperator#3835
I am pretty certain their is no connection, just an honest copy paste mistake.

I have tried to harvest data from all the prospective NN proposals, it is difficult to compare all the different promises.  Lots of our prospective operators are very generous to the community.  It would be nice to get more specifics on location of servers.

[21-Apr-19 07:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ill update my my github when I am back home but I will be using at least 15% of mining rewards to support a bounty fund for KMD projects(for dev/marketing/ project improvement) initially this will be used to fund a gui dev for CHIPS, then for other KMD projects to apply for.

[21-Apr-19 08:47 AM] newvulcan#4719
I'm updating my PR today, but essentially my Test Server is based in Manchester as thats where I could get a rolling Monthly contract - The Mainnet I'm hoping will be based just down the road from me in a DC in Manchester,UK as thats where I used to work, so I know the setup there. 10% of KMD earnt will go back to KMD.
