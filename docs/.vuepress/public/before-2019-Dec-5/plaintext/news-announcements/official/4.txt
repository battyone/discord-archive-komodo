Two short twitter threads from our CTO @ca333 worth reading everyone ! 

1. Crosschain atomic swap has been executed/processed solely with SPV technology which means users wont have to sync (download) a full blockchain db or to run a blockchain daemon in order to use our DEX technology https://twitter.com/0xca333/status/1088245559134171136

This article is an intro into the new tech that solves the #blockchain #oracle problem using Komodo Platform's #opensource application framework for custom consensus.  It shows how full nodes all participate in the decentralized oracle validation and then scales it using existing lite wallet protocols without any changes.  Komodo's multi-chain architecture and #interoperability between coin protocols will enable application #developers to build out ecosystems that talk to one another, like current web services - but p2p, validated and secure.

Komodo is a permissionless platform. However, with the application layer (programmable blockchain) that Komodo‚Äôs Custom Consensus modules enable, a developer team can create a permissioned blockchain solution.

everyone We have released new version of Agama 0.3.6. The updated version has a lot of changes and an improved UI to make it more user friendly. This version changes how you create new wallet in Lite or Native mode and the way you use Lite mode vs Native mode.

Direct login using seed or WIF key is no longer supported. You will need to use restore wallet feature first with existing seed or WIF.
Concurrent usage of native and lite mode coins is deprecated. From now on you can either run Lite mode coins or Native mode coins during one session.
Your coins selection is automatically stored when you add or remove coins.
Native mode coins can be started without creating an Agama wallet. Just add them using the login screen.
Following security best practices you must write down your seed in a safe place while creating a new account. Do NOT take screenshot or picture of your seed on a machine that is connected to internet.
We have updated guides on how to use the new lite mode https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024492-create-new-wallet-and-encrypt-seed-spv-
How to restore wallet with new Lite mode using seed/WIF https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026360-use-private-key-wif-or-seed-phrase-to-login-into-agama-lite-mode
Please find all Agama Desktop related guides here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/29000034534
If you have further questions please search the solutions page to find answers first before asking for help. In case you still need help, please visit #deleted-channel channel where community and team members are constantly helping users in need. Alternatively, you can create a support ticket. A link to support help desk is available within Agama, just click on 3 lines (menu icon) on the top-right corner or Agama and select Support.

The Tokens Custom Consensus (CC) module enables core-asset support for the on-chain creation of colored coins, also called tokens. The functionality is facilitated by utxo technology. Tokens can be generated on any chain where the ac_cc is enabled.

everyone  **Security Alert**: if you created or used your seed phrase with Agama please deinstall it, stop using it and immediately rotate your seeds and move all your coins out from there (to a different seed - which was NOT created with Agama) - if you know what you are doing please use either cold-storage (paper-wallets, offline storage, ...), the KomodoOcean wallet or komodo-cli. We will provide you an alternative desktop wallet very soon. If you need assistance please reach out to our support team: #support.
Our team will provide you all details of the incident in the coming days. 
This does only affect seeds that were used or created with Agama for Desktop, Mobile or Browser.

[05-Jun-19 01:50 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Please remain clam and move your funds securely.

**What wallet can I use?**

1. Paper wallet (best to use in offline computer) - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024508-paper-wallet-guide
2. Use native mode from source - https://github.com/jl777/komodo
3. Use pre-compiled binary for native mode - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/beta-multios-0.3.3b-2 
4. KomodoOceanQT wallet - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ - guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet
5. Ledger
6. Send to Exchange (if you trust CEX)
