[25-Jun-18 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
need to turn it on and have CHIPS enabled for it to work, the order doesnt matter

[25-Jun-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the mpnet onoff:1 is only needed to send to CHIPS, reading is free so if it is enabled it will do it

the slow responding bobs get a lower ranking when ordermatching. maybe i need to tweak the penalty to make it much more severe?

[26-Jun-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
has anyone tested on win10 with mpnet?

[26-Jun-18 07:31 AM] jansako#3330
I tried but the coins db update disappeared all the icons and all I saw were the missing icon messages in the console... which branch should I use?

[26-Jun-18 08:05 AM] jansako#3330
OK, figured that part out.

[26-Jun-18 08:07 AM] jansako#3330
dunno that it needs to read the coins db every minute... seeing what looks like refresh requests scrolling by... just saying

[26-Jun-18 08:27 AM] jansako#3330
Put up a seller bob on SN, see if I get any nibbles. Will be trying alice on other pairs, let's see how it goes.

[26-Jun-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder  how often is coinsDB updated, it seem only need to do it once per instance?

[26-Jun-18 08:32 AM] jansako#3330
It is doing "coins_db_read_ "for explorers, coins_json and electrums. round and round üòÉ

[26-Jun-18 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to do it more than once on init

this god damn forkers... can't rename  their stuff... talking about Zcash when it is a completely different coin... best would be to disable such coins

[26-Jun-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
we might need to disable ZEC as i think they changed the tx serialization format

they changed the onchain tx serialization to include maxtime in mempool.

[26-Jun-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
which wasnt needed to be done to change the txformat after it is not in mempool anymore

the read logs are only about reading the local coins.json file data.

[26-Jun-18 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's not calling github every single time user see prints of showing reading coinsdb data etc on console.

[26-Jun-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
why the need to call the file 12 bajillion times if/when nothing changed?
If a user is trading CoinX/CoinY for 5 hrs and nothing else, there's no need to use resources not involved in trading CoinX/CoinY
