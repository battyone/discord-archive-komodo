[24-Jun-18 05:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes you can set them to 1

[24-Jun-18 05:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just turn them on

[24-Jun-18 05:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
they should have been turned on by default ü§î

probably your price was too low

[24-Jun-18 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
or if you have fill:1 no bob had the right sized utxo, but the latest version they will autocreate them

[24-Jun-18 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if they can and it isnt a large percentage of their balance >25%

completed BTC KMD trade. It was quicker. far quicker üôÇ üëç

[24-Jun-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to get 100% ordermatch rate. if it was possible you would have to fill all orders no matter how ridiculous

[24-Jun-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
that wont be happening, so there will still be errors

[24-Jun-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is finding errors that shouldnt be happening

[24-Jun-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I found a glitch (still looking on exactly how to replicate it since I had 2 scripts running and a manual buy order) where BTC/KMD buy of KMD turned itself into a sell KMD

[24-Jun-18 06:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
CHIPS KMD trade started quicker too! I just placed the order matching my inventory utxo and it started üòÉ

[24-Jun-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a pervasize change so we do need to test all the usual cases. likely doing 2 or more trade api calls at the same time would lead to unexpected results, but having it flip the order around, I am not sure how that would happen

[24-Jun-18 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers pushed a bug fix for `fill` `gtc` buttons for linux.
I noticed on linux it somehow starts as off state. They should by default start as on.
so if user for example turns them off, goes back to portfolio screen, clicks on exchange button, they will by default be on.
also they must be on after first time login to barterdex too.
let me know if you still find them off by default etc.

[24-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> ok

[24-Jun-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be a better default is gtc:1 fill:0, but not sure. depends on if it is better to get a partial fill or to sometimes/usually get a complete fill 5 to 10 min later

pushed possible fix for spontaneously reversing the order. it looks like some edge cases it is possible for alice to become bob

[24-Jun-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i made it so that doesnt happen. if you had autoprice going and do an alice trade for the same pair, then temporarily it should cancel the bob order and then come back with the next autoprice iteration

[24-Jun-18 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
> some edge cases it is possible for alice to become bob
In those cases, if the order stops at bob deposit, will later swapstatus still pick up the fail and return deposit?

[24-Jun-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
any swap that gets started will generate the DB/SWAPS files and that has the info needed to reclaim bobdeposi

[24-Jun-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
