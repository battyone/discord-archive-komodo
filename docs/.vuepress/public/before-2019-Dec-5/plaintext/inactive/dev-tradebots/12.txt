[29-Jun-18 02:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once confirmed it's good for release

[29-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> which branch of github.com/jl777/coins is being used for coinsdb?

[29-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> i just noticed there are a bunch of assetchains missing

[29-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> well, not a bunch, but the ones i created recently

[29-Jun-18 04:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
master branch of jl777/coins

[29-Jun-18 04:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
try fetch updates etc button to get latest list from github if it doesn' show latest coins list.

[29-Jun-18 04:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
fetch coindb update button

[29-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> i dont see the coins in the coins repo either

[29-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> so they are missing, need to add them

[29-Jun-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

nm, I figured out the delete, manual add, restart thing

[29-Jun-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Now that's sorted, there seems to be a malfunction with the debug raw send

[29-Jun-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

Hi, in `SuperNET/iguana` what are the the differences between the scripts in `exchanges` and `dexscripts`?

Somehow the tx is not getting through

[30-Jun-18 12:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[30-Jun-18 12:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@cipi are the spv servers ok?

[30-Jun-18 12:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, it's not in the mempool of anything I have running:
`$ komodo-cli -ac_name=COQUI getrawmempool

[30-Jun-18 01:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers had forgot to add important line in HTML code for promise lib, without which the windows manage coin git coinsdb list would have given error.
jus woke up and remembered I didn't push that change... üòÖ 
pushed it now. should work fine.

[30-Jun-18 01:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie that modulus fail error is coming from chartX library. it pings to check the license and seems to be failing to check that.

[30-Jun-18 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@grewalsatinder Do we need to add an actual off feature for those that never use them?

[30-Jun-18 02:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie  we have no certain way to tell if anyone is using or not using.

[30-Jun-18 02:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I agree, we should replace it with better charts

[30-Jun-18 02:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be the ones @siu - Chainmakers did?

[30-Jun-18 02:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was it siu ? ü§î

@siu - Chainmakers that explorer is stuck: https://explorer.coqui.cash/ this one shows the correct height: https://coqui.kmdexplorer.io/ ... and the tx has 150 confirmations: https://coqui.kmdexplorer.io/tx/110dc769bce6d45e8dfcfbd5d2748b7c36bbb5a3ecfa73e85de59e4340e25012

If I click a button that's the equivalent of "I'm never going to use these charts", it would seem to me that's a good way to know

[30-Jun-18 02:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
do you get any analytics of how many users are using bartedex and how many have explicitly enabled or disabled these kinda of settings ?

[30-Jun-18 02:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would help.

[30-Jun-18 02:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not really, because most input we had on charts had to do with the lack of functionality; along the lines of "fek it, they don't work anyway so meh it'll be OK if they're gone"
Which was the reason for "hide" iirc

[30-Jun-18 02:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true that. but I'd prefer to have them replaced than just removed.
just single red line of 404 from lib is harmless to the console log which don't show to anyone.
and I don't see it slowing down anything in the app.

[30-Jun-18 02:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[30-Jun-18 02:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
maybe it's good idea to add the one which I guess someone else made on the website.
I don't remember who was that. @siu - Chainmakers or @jorian ?? ü§î

since the stats log is expected to be always up to date on website, I think the end user will get always up to date charts info in app if I call these charts in app

[30-Jun-18 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Is there a Windows DL link for Barter DEX 1.1.0, all I see is an OSX download.

[30-Jun-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
given that the OSX post is only 4 minutes old, I'm going to say that it's in the process

[30-Jun-18 03:10 PM] Acura#2748
Is there any trick on the new BarterDex Release 1.10 to add coins? I only see 3 Coins on the list to add - ETOMIC; Bitcoin & Komodo

[30-Jun-18 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart

i also have problems swapping erc20 tokens, but no error message, maybe the parity node has some problems... normal coins are working fine

yes, no error message in my computer either

[30-Jun-18 05:14 PM] cipi#4502
i already used this version in the past to do erc20 swaps, so i think the parity node has problems, could not explain it otherwise

I downloaded this latest version but can't add coins, they're all "undefined" in the menu and without icons. If I try to add any it says there's no electrum servers. The tar.zg package on Ubuntu

Never had to any of this with earlier releases.

Have bronchitis, will figure this out later.

[30-Jun-18 10:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@agnewpickens You're correct, this wasn't in earlier releases.
BarterDEX has reached a point where it actually works with "too many" coins.
The current solution seemed the best option, I'm sure that over time it will become more intuitive and "user-friendly"

[30-Jun-18 10:33 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Can only figure out how to add one other coin right now, will take this up later.

@grewalsatinder can we add a startup dialogue to barterDEX that says "You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart"
it seems everybody has the same problem and there is no way to really know this

[02-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Acura#2748
It would be cool to change the BarterDex Settings/ Manage Coins without entering a Seed - Maybe it's workable like in Agama

[02-Jul-18 12:18 PM] PTYX#6840
we need to add the same seed login mechanism to barterdex too so users don't have to paste teh seed all the time

[02-Jul-18 12:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

With current dev branch win build of mm (originally posted in #dev-marketmaker, but deleted and move here because I cannot replicate it directly using mm on nix) :

`broadcast error.({"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"})`
any idea why I keep getting this and swaps never start?

`myfee rawtxsend.[226] 9e7837d7bab30c8b5ce4bddece5bf78b456acc408fe254d929dc57c3b3622b9c vs 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
seems to be related because bobdeposits are being made despite myfee not being paid

[02-Jul-18 05:49 PM] cipi#4502
@AngelaTrishia29 no, the only bob offering SANC for sale is my own... and i had to use a fixed price, because there is no external price source to do autoprice... SANC is not on CMC... the SANC-guys would have to run their own bob, i assume they have enough SANC and i assume they want to sell some

[02-Jul-18 05:51 PM] cipi#4502
but the txfees on ETH chain are anyway extremely high: https://etherscan.io/gastracker, so every swap would cost 5$ txfees or so... i don't think that someone would want to trade erc20 tokens when the txfees are so high... maybe if they want to swap tokens worth 10000$ üòÉ
