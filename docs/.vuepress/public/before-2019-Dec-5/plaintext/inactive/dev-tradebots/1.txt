@noashh hey mate, can you please check if DIscord is linked with Slack #dev-tradebots channel?
looks like the messages are not showing there from discord.

@KomodoWorld it's best to add the coins to jl777/coins repo.

Considering they are talking about erc20's, I'm sure they will say the same about etomic being the centralizing factor in barterdex

@jorian how could be that true? when you can trade any token for BTC or KMD or LTC?

Is anyone else having issues withdrawing from Barterdex?

[19-Jun-18 02:03 AM] ch6ris#5240
It's not really withdrawing, more making a transaction on your own wallet/address to another addresz.

If the spv server is down that can cause problems with your balance.
