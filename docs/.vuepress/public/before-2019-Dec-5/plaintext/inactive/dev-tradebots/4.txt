pushed to dev branch a very significant new flag and bug fix!

[23-Jun-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
all orders now support a "fill":1 flag, if set the order must fill 100% the volume specified. since many people complained about this (even if they got a better price) it should reduce complaints, alice has utxos

[23-Jun-18 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
while implemeting it for bobside, I realized that somewhere along the way, bob scanning of smaller sized trades was lost! So I now have bob scanning smaller and smaller trade sizes if he cant fill the full order (only if fill:0 which will be the default for any older versions)

[23-Jun-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
from what I see bob not filling partial orders is the main cause for people not being able to ordermatch. the other is networking troubles, especially on windows. current fix wont change that but being able to  ordermatch partials will increase ordermatch (and user complaints that the full order didnt complete). Before alice was operatng as fill:0 and bob as fill:1

from the user point of view alice.fill.0/bob.fill.1 would likely look very similar to alice.fill.0/bob.fill.0
of course until all the bobs update, we wont see the full effect. updating my bobs

[23-Jun-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
they are all updated

[23-Jun-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the reason we didnt find this was alice doing the partial fills (Scanning for utxo that fit) made it so partial fills were normal and the assumption was bob was also doing fill:0

[23-Jun-18 05:27 PM] allbits#5898
Earlly indications are that this is working much better üí™

re: `canbind=1`, is it better to go in `xxcoinc.conf` or in `client`, as in `./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":1,\"canbind\":1,\"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &`?

jl777 branch now supports gtc:1 flag, it is only valid for that instance of mm, eg. on exit it will forget, so it isnt really a gtc (yet), but it does keep repeating the order every 5 minutes, cancel uuid will stop the repeating

combining gtc:1 with fill:1 will trigger bob to create the utxos to exactly match your order. all you need to do i smake sure you have big enough utxo for your order and the dexfee. debugging the automatic utxo creator

@jl777c where do I need to add this flag? `gtc:1` ?

in buy or sell api call

[24-Jun-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Jun-18 01:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`var ajax_data = { "userpass": userpass, "method": "sell", "base": base_coin, "rel": rel_coin, "price": mt_data.price, "basevolume": mt_data.volume };`

[24-Jun-18 01:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if I statically just add this `gtc:1`, it will pass this in all manual trade commands for sell.

[24-Jun-18 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that OK or do I need to add more conditions ?

[24-Jun-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
thre is fill and gtc now:
fill:0 gtc:0 <- how it behaved before, basically an immediate or cancel order
fill:1 gtc:0 is a fill or kill order
fill:1 gtc:1 is probably the thing to do for a default
fill:0 gtc:1 will stop as soon as any part of the order is done

also as soon as a trade starts, it basically cancels the gtc

[24-Jun-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
this is all for alice side! now alice can automatically put in long term orders (as long as mm is running): ioc, fok, gtc variations

[24-Jun-18 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks üôÇ

awesome, this should "solve" many complaints

[24-Jun-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
bob will only do an auto utxo combine once per 3 blocks per coin

[24-Jun-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but alice will just keep repeating the gtc:1/fill:1 order every 5 minutes, so even for BTC it should eventually fill if there is a liquid bob

[24-Jun-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, I got tired of hearing about how mm is so hard to use due to utxo. now the only utxo issue alice needs to follow is to have one big enough for the trade and one for the dexfee. hopefully that wont be too hard for people. also, it will autosplit if they ignored the instrutions and only have one utxo

autoprice is just for bob

[24-Jun-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810

the uuid for gtc orders will end in cccccc

[24-Jun-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
these uuid will keep appearing, over and over, even though that will drive luke crazy

[24-Jun-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I saw a bunch of trades not get filled, but it triggered autocombine on the bobs and now the same gtc trades are CONNECTED

5 such trades

[24-Jun-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c oh you mean you added it as default option to all trades ?

[24-Jun-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe people will want partial fills, so it could just be two checkboxes default on

gtc [x]
fill[x]

gtc:0 fill:0 is immediate or cancel and should show up when that is the pair set

right, okay I just add these two more boxes and don't change the autoprice option. I leave it there.

gtc:0 fill:1 is fill or kill
