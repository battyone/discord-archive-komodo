in the last 40 Days they rebooted the host once ( last night ) it's ok for that price

[19-Jun-18 10:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
just cronjob after reboot and you should be fine

[19-Jun-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I'll set startup scripts

[19-Jun-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
that should be fine for this

[19-Jun-18 10:40 AM] lukechilds#2707

[19-Jun-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Yes, ovh does

[19-Jun-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Although many businesses in the US ask for ID now after you pay with a card. It's annoying and I've canceled orders before because of it

[19-Jun-18 11:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
really I did not have to show my Chicken I hope it stays that way must be something new
let me know if you need a server.

[19-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jorian#4555
yeah i can hook you up too

[19-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jorian#4555
maybe it's because you're not in the EU or sth

[19-Jun-18 12:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
it''s ok

[19-Jun-18 12:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm verified now

[19-Jun-18 12:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks though

[19-Jun-18 01:18 PM] jorian#4555
did you show them your chicken?

[19-Jun-18 01:34 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@lukechilds and @CHMEX I‚Äôve gotten komodod to build on .5 gb of ram on low end VPS‚Äôs. It just requires 4gb of swap memory, just for future reference

[19-Jun-18 01:34 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Ahh I missed @blackjok3r said swapfile as well

@SHossain @siu - Chainmakers I haven't heard any issues on coinsdb from any one.

[20-Jun-18 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Either nobody tested it enough, or may be it's working as expected.

[20-Jun-18 06:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it's best to make a release from `coinsdb` branch and publish it's package on release section of repo so general users can test.

[20-Jun-18 06:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
please still keep it only in house testing release...

[20-Jun-18 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means no major announcements until confirmed it's working for those early testers.

[20-Jun-18 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
once enough users report it's working as expected, we can merge it to dev branch and to master branch.

unless you have 50% margin, it would end up the same at such satoshi level pricing

Best to wait 4 hours and see if it moves, after that remove the swap file?

[20-Jun-18 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[21-Jun-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure that trying to place a valid order counts as "spamming"...

[21-Jun-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and even if you count it as "spamming", there's still the fact that it lacks liquidity to the point that one has to "spam" it for 2 months in order to sell 400 ü§¶

[21-Jun-18 11:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
Intensive testing I would call it. You might have done up 20% of all atomic swaps.

[21-Jun-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if 6-10 swaps a week is 20%, then we're in trouble :/
