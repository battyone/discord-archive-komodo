I read you are swapping Komodo, ltc and BTC.  Can someone point me to repository or docs?  Want to see what it would take to swap DCR

[24-Sep-18 03:19 PM] PTYX#6840
DCR is already supported on barterdex I thought

`After that trade fails, listunspent only shows the one 0.20789742 utxo, until I restart bdex. ` yes, it does, because it locks the utxos and releases them after a while or when you restart marketmaker

[25-Sep-18 12:11 PM] cipi#4502
and the swap fails to start, simply because it does not find the right utxos, it only has one `added 1 of 1 from LTC listunspents`

Yes. Would be nice to have it off by default since it seems like the latest mm has some dificulty with it

@jl777c any suggestion?

[01-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if testing shows problems, leaving it defaulted on will create extra support issues

[01-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want less support issues, change the default

[01-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to ask about such things

[01-Oct-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay üëç

[01-Oct-18 01:18 PM] cipi#4502
the "problem" with GTC is that people are issuing swap requests without first looking in orderbook and so they try to buy amounts that are simply not available on the bobs... saw such requests spamming the network for hours up to days

[01-Oct-18 01:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if that is the problem, it should be the same when not having them on

[01-Oct-18 01:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
since you are aiming for a UTXO that is not available

[01-Oct-18 01:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but in my tests, once i turn them off using exactly the same price and amounts, it works.

[01-Oct-18 01:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lets try to have them off in this release, if we get more support issues or problems we change it back.
