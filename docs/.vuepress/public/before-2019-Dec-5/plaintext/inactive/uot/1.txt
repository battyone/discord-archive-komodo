Cool, thanks @jl777c

[04-Oct-18 05:04 PM] jspook16#3059
Hell yes!!  Makes me want to go back to school for a CS degree

[05-Oct-18 12:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You don't need a degree in fact o would say not having any formal training has helped me learn this block chain stuff faster, because there is no prior knowledge making me think things should be a certain way, and I I can just learn from 0 with block chain concepts.

Who will be in this channel

[05-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Should probably lay down the ground rules hard and fast

[05-Oct-18 03:24 AM] jspook16#3059
I can get around the chains pretty good.  It's tougher to implement an app for me ..outside of something easy in python

[05-Oct-18 03:26 AM] jspook16#3059
For myself yeah. Mostly scripts to manage my stuff more efficiently or status it

[05-Oct-18 03:27 AM] jspook16#3059
Not yet. I want toake some progress on the chat thing I've been looking into first

[05-Oct-18 03:27 AM] jspook16#3059
To make

[05-Oct-18 03:29 AM] jspook16#3059

Hey, Sajib Datta from UTA had asked me to join this channel.

[10-Oct-18 10:20 PM] ashwin#5867
I would like to know where to find the code for OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITIONS

[10-Oct-18 10:50 PM] Kalyan#1867
Hello Everyone, I am Kalyan Sikdar, graduate student in University of Texas, Arlington. I am new to this group and have been invited by Dr. Sajib Dutta. Thank you for having me here.

[10-Oct-18 11:07 PM] Hermes#6934
@ashwin  you can check our #cc-general  channel there you can find the pinned posts for the latest updates

[10-Oct-18 11:07 PM] Hermes#6934
Welcome aboard

[11-Oct-18 03:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ashwin @Kalyan https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions is a very good resource to explain what CC's are at a high level, will help you learn the terminology and things like that

Hello , Dr Datta from invited me to join this channel.

[11-Oct-18 05:46 AM] SuSC135#6248
I am very much interested in block chains and have been exploring few uses cases from  past one year. Komodo has really interesting concepts and I am really looking forward to work on it.  Right now I am just going through the github link . Let's see where it takes me

[11-Oct-18 06:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the mastering crypto conditions is a great place to start. #kmdlabs  we make all kinds of cool things, and provide a way for test chains to have notarisation, if your project or needs that... for example to use multiple blockchains that can interact with each other.

[11-Oct-18 03:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/index-contracts.html is a good resource as well

[11-Oct-18 10:04 PM] ashwin#5867
If I have any technical questions, which channel should I ask?

[12-Oct-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Depends on what your asking about ?

[12-Oct-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
#ask-jl777  is a good one for indepth tech things

[12-Oct-18 08:45 AM] abcdelweb#0752

[12-Oct-18 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ashwin you can ask here too, or #dev-general

[12-Oct-18 05:12 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Hey guys, I'm Preston. I help out in the Verus discord, mainly basic issues. I'm going to spend time in here daily to read over & try to understand, and maybe begin to participate soon, on a very basic level, if that. Lol when guys say I shill KMD my response is, you know everyone that dev team is as sharp as a tack..
They can't help but laugh.. Good to be here. See you around

[12-Oct-18 05:41 PM] ashwin#5867
I've been having some trouble building and running Komodod on Mac. The build-mac.sh file in the zcultils directory only recognizes gcc@6. I had gcc@7 and it did not recognize the compiler. If that is a bug, I can fix the build-mac.sh to recognize version >= gcc6 on Mac.

[12-Oct-18 05:41 PM] ashwin#5867
Running zcutils/fetch-params.sh gives the following errors `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh: line 112: flock: command not found
Only one instance of fetch-params.sh can be run at a time.`

[12-Oct-18 06:05 PM] Hermes#6934
Thanks for the feedback , haven't tried gcc7 will test this and let you know from our side

[12-Oct-18 06:24 PM] Hermes#6934
@ashwin  Currently we have seen that gcc6 is working with no issues , this is why still is the version that is in the guide , unless we see that it presents an issue there's no i need to change it.

[12-Oct-18 06:33 PM] ashwin#5867
@Hermes ok.Im having trouble with this step also. Running zcutils/fetch-params.sh gives the following errors ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh: line 112: flock: command not found
Only one instance of fetch-params.sh can be run at a time.

[12-Oct-18 06:36 PM] Hermes#6934
inside the komodo directory right ? Just in case this is the most updated guide for Mac users , make sure you have the complete dependency packages that are previous to this part of the installation https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-osx

[12-Oct-18 06:42 PM] ashwin#5867
@Hermes that works perfectly.

[12-Oct-18 06:44 PM] Hermes#6934
good to know , just in case which guide you were using in order to update it ?

[12-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Hermes#6934 (pinned)
These are our most updated documents  regarding from start to finish from launching Komodo CLI to understanding assetchain creation and Barterdex our Decentralized exchange https://docs.komodoplatform.com/index.html

hey all,  Faisal here. Excited to start working with y'all

[16-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
My idea is for each dev to come up with a custom CC to implement

[16-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I am happy to help with implementation questions and even basic design issues as I understand this is totally new territory

[16-Oct-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but you need to be creating and come up with a unique consensus rule change that will change the world! or at least be useful to some specific set of people

[16-Oct-18 09:58 PM] ashwin#5867
I tried this command `./komodo-cli faucetfund` it gives me an error `o use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet`

[16-Oct-18 09:58 PM] ashwin#5867
It started the demon with `$./komodod -pubkey=file.pub`

[16-Oct-18 10:08 PM] ashwin#5867
Does it read the publickey from the given file?

[17-Oct-18 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
you need a valid pubkey in the -pubkey= parameter

[17-Oct-18 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
use validateaddress <taddr>

[17-Oct-18 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the "pubkey" field starts with 02 or 03, 66 chars for a 33 byte secp256k1 compressed pubkey

[18-Oct-18 12:17 AM] ashwin#5867
can i create a wallet in cli?

[18-Oct-18 12:22 AM] ashwin#5867
What is a z address?

[18-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
komodo is a fork of Zcash and Zcash has two kinds of address: a z-addr is a fully private address that uses the zero-knowledge proving system to shield a transaction and balance privacy. A t-addr (aka "transparent address") is similar to a Bitcoin address.

[18-Oct-18 12:31 AM] ashwin#5867
Ok. How do i create a wallet so that I have an address?

[18-Oct-18 12:32 AM] ashwin#5867
Should I get a zcash address and  validate it with komodo-cli?

[18-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
a lot of your questions probably can be answered from here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/search/solutions?term=cli&authenticity_token=LfoqrYfEGaIHkS%2Bk9ZhSQCtPlDJ9a2J0uP3I%2BO4kfbA%3D

[18-Oct-18 12:38 AM] ashwin#5867
Is it payingkey or transmissionkey the pubkey?

[18-Oct-18 12:42 AM] ashwin#5867
@Gordon Komodo  Thanks that link was useful.

👌 

[18-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the pubkey should be of the address , I am a noob myself 😄

./komodod -ac_name=origin -pubkey=02924f03a79ea43b5b3790978a2b099c20c95dac517e269d1eca52a808b0223797

[18-Oct-18 01:07 AM] ashwin#5867
I still get the same error `to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet`

[18-Oct-18 02:45 AM] cipi#4502
`komodo-cli validateaddress xxxxxx` shows you the pubkey of  the address xxxxx, if it is in your wallet

[18-Oct-18 06:46 AM] gcharang#6833
@ashwin this doc might help you: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/test-use-write-integrate-cc.html

[18-Oct-18 06:46 AM] gcharang#6833
the asset chain should also have the `-ac-cc` parameter to test cc contracts

[18-Oct-18 06:02 PM] ashwin#5867
@gcharang it still gives me the same error

[18-Oct-18 06:03 PM] ashwin#5867
`./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=Origin -pubkey=02924f03a79ea43b5b3790978a2b099c20c95dac517e269d1eca52a808b0223797 -setindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10`

[18-Oct-18 06:06 PM] gcharang#6833
Is this the command you entered: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=origin faucetfund`

[18-Oct-18 06:07 PM] gcharang#6833
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/faucet/rpc/faucetfund.html @ashwin  you have to specify the amount too

[18-Oct-18 06:10 PM] ashwin#5867
@gcharang  These are the steps I ran : `./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=Origin -pubkey=0244ab0355c208f707c465d7acd021ef30dce227e9b0b0ec3973bd80535b789b28 -setindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10`

[18-Oct-18 06:11 PM] ashwin#5867

[18-Oct-18 06:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Do you have funds in your wallet?

[18-Oct-18 06:12 PM] ashwin#5867
I dont

[18-Oct-18 06:12 PM] ashwin#5867
How do i add?

[18-Oct-18 06:13 PM] ashwin#5867
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=Origin getaddressbalance '{"addresses": ["RHczSAiLa1nmUSWFYUiXUZjggoeWPQZPr7"]}'
{
  "balance": 0,
  "received": 0
}
`

[18-Oct-18 06:13 PM] gcharang#6833
You will have to start mining the chain using the command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=Origin setgenerate true -1`

[18-Oct-18 06:14 PM] ashwin#5867
ok

[18-Oct-18 06:14 PM] gcharang#6833
Is the pubkey `0244ab0355c208f707c465d7acd021ef30dce227e9b0b0ec3973bd80535b789b28` generated in this wallet or in a previous wallet?

[18-Oct-18 06:15 PM] ashwin#5867
In this wallet

[18-Oct-18 06:15 PM] gcharang#6833
If it was from a previous wallet, you will have to import it's privkey in this chain's wallet

[18-Oct-18 06:16 PM] gcharang#6833
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=Origin validateaddress RHczSAiLa1nmUSWFYUiXUZjggoeWPQZPr7`  does it give `ismine:true` and `pubkey:0244ab0355c208f707c465d7acd021ef30dce227e9b0b0ec3973bd80535b789b28` ?

[18-Oct-18 06:17 PM] ashwin#5867
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=Origin setgenerate true -1` This gives an error

[18-Oct-18 06:17 PM] ashwin#5867
`Error: There is no RPC client functionality in komodod. Use the komodo-cli utility instead.`

[18-Oct-18 06:18 PM] gcharang#6833
Which repo did you use to build komodo?

[18-Oct-18 06:19 PM] ashwin#5867
`https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform` master branch

[18-Oct-18 06:21 PM] ashwin#5867
