This time I used KMD/RFOX atomic interchange, not with test coins, it took 15 minutes, and the perfect interchange was successful, it feels great.

That was my attemp

[19-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Simon#6247
I have my app open non stop for the last 30 minutes or so

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
But the last attemps i made went that way, only until 2/3 swap ongoing then failed, i only have success on Rick/Morty and one Ltc/Kmd

[19-Jul-19 01:57 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
And have the app open all the process

[19-Jul-19 01:58 PM] Simon#6247
I have succesfully made a Verus to KMD swap, and a lot of RICKMORTY swaps

[19-Jul-19 01:59 PM] Simon#6247
I'm still missing the 13.37 verus in my balance right now, it says swap is still ongoing 2/3

[19-Jul-19 02:01 PM] Simon#6247
Maybe your swap failed, because I was trying to swap KMD for DOGE at the same time? Just thinking out loud

[19-Jul-19 02:05 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Since were on beta test can be, but in all my failed attemps was only trying with one attemp at the moment, but failed every time the same way, only went until 2/3

When there is "Best available price", is it impossible to create new order?
Best available rate on atomicDEX is higher than CMC or other CEX.

@goldenman the "showing all available orders" and "allow manual order-creation" features are coming in the next weeks - at this time it is not enabled.

What is the fee for bitcoin withdrawal from atomicdex?

[21-Jul-19 07:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
how about we just airdrop a deflationary erc20 token like ethplode and call it dexit. we could set up the smart contract to burn the dexit token once the swap is made. an assetchain called ethrekt will be created and distributed one for one for each dexit token burned. ethrekt will be a vehicle to to fund gas fees for future eth/kmd swaps. eth put into the address of your dexit token address will help cover the cost of gas fees, you can get a percentage of the dexfee for these conversions only. I have no idea how the minutiae would work, just spitballing. https://airdrops.io/ethplode/
