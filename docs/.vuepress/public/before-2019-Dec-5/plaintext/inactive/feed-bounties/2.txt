@blackjok3r can you please add support for private coins as well?

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can try that

[04-Dec-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in general, they dont need the spicial coinbase ...

[04-Dec-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think webworker made pirate workign pool.

[04-Dec-18 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, he was working on the pirate pool

[04-Dec-18 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I copies some of his code to get mine working. I think it was just a small change he copied from verus though.

[04-Dec-18 01:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
For private only chains, it seems kind of required to take the pool fee out from the coinbase as normal, otherwise the pool OP could easily steal coins and the miners wouldnt know about it.

also a very cool thing would be to how dpow protected on a transaction shown on the explorer
something like that

I can offer 200 KMD if somebody can do that

issue a getrawtransaction and if "confirmations" == "rawconfirmations" -> set "protected by dPoW"

@Decker mighty insight master. Do you think that is a lot of work? Is that something you can do?

[11-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
@webworker01 was helpful in getting import/exports txs shown properly on LABS explorers, maybe he's interested?

[11-Feb-19 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
Is anyone willing to chip in for a bounty to show all CC txs properly? Right now I believe CC vouts simply aren't shown

[12-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I looked at doing something like that when I was messing with MoMoM, web helped link the explorers together but I got most of it working with some of his advice. I didnt like it, but its not that bad. The rpoblem is, not the explorer so much but making the RPCs match the explorer. For instance MoMoM I had to heavily modify 2 repos for explorer and 2 or 3 RPC calls in komodod....

[12-Feb-19 06:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
Decker volunteered to do it we just need to decide on the design

Hello, I do not know if this is the right place to post, but I would like to start support testing. I am a professional Java, Python and PHP developer with four years experience working as a Software Engineer and Technical Consulatant for a German bank. So if there is anything to test, I would like to help. (why testing and not programming? Because I know how hard it is to get into a mature software product and testing is the best way to learn. Later I would like to help programm features)

[19-Mar-19 05:06 PM] radix42#3743
like, is anyone besides myself whack enough to go after the EWASM and Solidity ones?

[19-Mar-19 05:07 PM] radix42#3743
and if so have they gotten anywhere to your knowledge?

[19-Mar-19 05:07 PM] radix42#3743
don't wanna bust my butt if someone else is almost there!

[19-Mar-19 05:08 PM] radix42#3743
^^^ @jl777c I am down to this part of my TODO list it seems

[19-Mar-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
I doubt anybody else has made any meaningful progress

[19-Mar-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the key to all these language ones is to allow calling a txid

[19-Mar-19 05:08 PM] radix42#3743
that's what i thought, as "step zero" is what you just said lol

[19-Mar-19 05:08 PM] radix42#3743
need to convert back and forth between utxo and account model

[19-Mar-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so in the txid is an opreturn with the functions code, parameters in the opreturn, results too

[19-Mar-19 05:09 PM] radix42#3743
think i know where to stick that in as a shim in the layer between the EVM and the blockchain

[19-Mar-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and access to blockchain variables that are useful

[19-Mar-19 05:09 PM] radix42#3743
the EVM does everything based on a balance in an address

[19-Mar-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
blockhash, txid, utxo amounts, etc. basically a useful system that can be used

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use getaddressbalance

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] radix42#3743
yup

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] radix42#3743
what I'm planning on doing

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the time it will work, just need to have a reserve for txfees

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] radix42#3743
yeah, mapping that to gas

[19-Mar-19 05:10 PM] radix42#3743
this is gonna be some hella deep voodoo

need to prevent recursion, or at least extreme recursion

yeah they missed that one lol

[19-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it so much more efficient to just write a natively running CC but having interpreted languages is a good stepping stone

[19-Mar-19 05:15 PM] radix42#3743
its what all the kids are used to

[19-Mar-19 05:16 PM] radix42#3743
they were shocked on twitter at me waiting multi hours for native builds on RISC-V and ARM64 boards with slow IO

[19-Mar-19 05:17 PM] radix42#3743
fuck a PIVX RISC-V build took OVERNIGHT

(i was tossing a bone to the masternode privacy coin fetishists)

[19-Mar-19 05:20 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@radix42 Solidity bounty is still open but I'm no longer sure if it makes sense with the CC modules already so advanced. What could it be used for? If it's useful I can keep it or I can repurpose the bounty to something else 

The Wasm bounty is still open too, but just the other day @mrlynch asked me about that one and he's interested too... So I'm not sure what I should do if suddenly there are 2 people interested at the same time üòü        

Emmanuel is working on the Python one

Maybe is there something else that could be useful? Any idea? @jl777c

[19-Mar-19 05:20 PM] radix42#3743
they are useful in that they will add ethereum dAPP compatibility

[19-Mar-19 05:21 PM] radix42#3743
I think a horde of ethereum dAPP developers is a VERY useful thing for us to have!

[19-Mar-19 05:24 PM] radix42#3743
I pinged @mrlynch about where they are at

[19-Mar-19 05:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I also talked about solidity w @TwilightPunkster K64 because perhaps his CA6 could be extended to cover the bounty

[19-Mar-19 05:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
not sure if it's a good stepping point or not

[19-Mar-19 05:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but ok, perhaps it's no longer useful to port existing Ethereum Dapps (at this point it will be easier to rewrite them w CC), but could attract developers from Ethereum

[19-Mar-19 05:27 PM] radix42#3743
and actually @KomodoWorld and @jl777c I think that they solidity bounty is redundant to the EWASM one because if you have the EWASM VM you can just run solidity on it, no?

[19-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess solidity is becoming WASM?

[19-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, then yes it is redundant

[19-Mar-19 05:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok then, it's all combined into EWASM

[19-Mar-19 05:29 PM] radix42#3743
also @KomodoWorld MrLynch says that they haven't started it yet and I should just go for it

[19-Mar-19 05:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok then go for it!

[19-Mar-19 05:30 PM] radix42#3743

[19-Mar-19 05:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
to jump in (shortly, about to have dinner), EWASM is the future, but the big amount of people you want to attract are the indie developers using Loom and Enjin, which are pretty much schooled in Solidity.

[19-Mar-19 05:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(but thats just my two cents)

[19-Mar-19 05:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I don't mind, I am already using my solution (pretty much the turnkey for game developers) anyway.

[20-May-19 06:14 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no way to run a blockchain (I am thinking this is what you mean by bootstrap) on a mobile right now
you have to use lite mode (spv mode) - agama mobile, chameleon or others that support THC on mobile
