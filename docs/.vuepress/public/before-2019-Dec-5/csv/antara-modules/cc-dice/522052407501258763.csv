52 cards deck guessing game. 

Using DiceCC RNG as a main one which affect a game result and non on-chain RNG just for result visual representation.

Game modes:

1) Guess a suit: choose a spade, club, diamond or heart (actually placing a bet with odds 3 - 1:4)

2) Guess a card value: choose 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (actually placing a  bet with odds 12 - 1:13)

3) Guess a card: choose exact card value + suit (actually placing a  bet with odds 51 - 1:52)

If diceCC bet result ""won"" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which match player prediction

If diceCC bet result ""loss"" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which not match player prediction";"";"";
