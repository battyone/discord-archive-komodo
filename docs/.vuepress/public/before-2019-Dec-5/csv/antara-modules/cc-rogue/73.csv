1) Deadlock on bailout
```komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 ""[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22]"" -> (Minironyi) found baton 22b7f6bb559eb3919a2c0de2b51dfb0135dab73f683091ce96d756faf2ac8cee numkeys.1417 seed.1862856489122242256 playerdata.812 Node just hanging.```

2) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):

3) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with""couldnt find batontxid"" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

4) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in `2` (mentioned in report)

5) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - `invalid gametxid, or already started`  on game start and bailout with warrior gone";"";"";
