The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and maybe inspire some people.

Here's my current PR for the 3rd party resource Docs page, feel free to check it out and let me know if I missed anything, or if you want to add something you've been working on, or even just threw together. Ideally I'd like to have a GUI or TUI for every CC, and if possible a proof of concept using the CC for something.
