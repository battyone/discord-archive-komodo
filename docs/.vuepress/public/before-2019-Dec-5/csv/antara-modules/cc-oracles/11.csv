This channel is a good place to ask more about them. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator knows a lot about them and wrote a good article here: `https://blog.komodoplatform.com/anatomy-of-an-oracle-c6c2245b0196` .  The pinned 📌 messages ☝ also have some information.
Please ask if you have any questions 😄";"";"";

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Oracles CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!";"";"";

LABS uses oracles CC pretty extensively. Have a NN voting dapp and the LABS NN lottery dapp, among others";"";"👍 (1),labs (1)";

Example of such call: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/HM9kpFq7Xm/
What is interesting that if you'll try with data type lets say `L` - it'll work fine (```{
  ""result"": ""error"",
  ""error"": ""oracles description must be <= 4096 characters""
}
```)
happy coincidence that in description test was `s` type 😅
(tested on latest FSM)";"";"";
"272003866906722306";"TonyL#3577";"07-Nov-19 08:27 AM";"And one more edge case. After such call (too long oracle name):

  ""result"": ""error"",
  ""error"": ""oracles name must not be empty and up to 32 characters""
