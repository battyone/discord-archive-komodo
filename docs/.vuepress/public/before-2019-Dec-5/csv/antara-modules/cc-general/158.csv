We were trying to think how this would best work. I'm not sure you're able to make a game that is deterministically random as it uses a RNG every 7 blocks to determine the next 7. I thought maybe instead user could broadcast ""I want to play a game. I will multiply the next notarization hash by <arbitrary number>. They then multiply the notarization txid by <arbitrary number> and this gives them the 64 blocks(0-f represent different blocks) that are unique to them. Unique because of the arbitrary number they are multiplying the notarization txid by";"";"";

"405011811511828481";"Alright#0419";"07-Mar-19 10:37 PM";"we also talked about how we could actually validate game logic. It essentially requires every node to replay every game at this point, yes? A keystrokes tx would come in that claimed something like ""with this random seed, with these inputs, I got this score."" then each node would replay this game and verify that score is what the user claims given same seed and same inputs?";"";"";

Something like tetris maybe is easy enough... but going too complex with too many keystrokes is not going to work so well. So needs to be simpler.. Less data on chain will be required. There will be a few ways to do this.  But not really sure whats possible. Something that would be ideal, is if you can use a zkSNARK to prove the gameplay rather than have all nodes have to replay every game. I can see a full bock of tetris game txs grinding the chain to halt very fast.";"";"";

with a hashchain of seeds, you can have hundreds of seeds for thousands of seconds of gameplay.

if we're thinking about games beyond console, e.g. FPS, think about monsters spawning then acting on the seed they are given in the hashchain, all verifiable.   along with player co-ordinates, velocity etc. again a resolution thing.   this is where streamer data comes in handy @blackjok3r 

the life-cycle of all these can be compacted down with chain consolidation at a business/operations level.  active gamers will migrate all their accumulated stuff";"";"";
