This is my first attempt at making a CC from scratch, It changes a fair few things, and leverages the Verus Enhanced CCs with some changes I added myself, to make validation work. We havent tested this yet, but I hope to get a chain up on LABS as soon as I can. I tried to comment well, would be good if someone can have a look at this and let me know if there is something that needs clarifying, as I want people to understand how this works, so they can offer improvements to it. 
The one thing I dont like is that to make it work correctly, I needed to re purpouse the `version` integer in  `COptCCParams` to funcid. Really it should have both, or possibly, we can set version to 3, and maybe this will allow an extra integer to be added to the Class without beaking backwards compatibility.";"";"";
