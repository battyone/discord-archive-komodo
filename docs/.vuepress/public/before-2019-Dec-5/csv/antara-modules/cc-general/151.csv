A company my company works with uses a system called LPS for supply chain management of car parts and to make sure each part individually goes through all the processes by making a log of when it goes from station to station with an attatched anotator  of whether the part passed or failed the previous process based on parameter window limits. A blockchain is literally keymade for this type of part of tracking but would decentralized nodes holding the database fair better than a Centralized super computer server managing this kind of push/pull query.
