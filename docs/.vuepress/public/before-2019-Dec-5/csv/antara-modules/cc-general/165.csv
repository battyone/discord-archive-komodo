About that new finite state machine (FSM) CC module which is planned to create.
---
I looked through several implementations and seems this tasks is very well defined and it is not very hard to create it as a cc module.
Here is a nice one for pure c https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1275479/State-Machine-Design-in-C
It implements a basic FSM engine and provides macros to create state and event functions and transition map. 
Also it has useful concepts like guard conditions, entry and exit actions (seems this is derived from UML and this is good)
The important thing is that it supports both internal and external events. Internal events are those which are generated by the state machine.
I think in case of blockchain internal events could be timeouts and address spends or other blockchain events (mentioned in the article in medium.com) so we could provide implementations of some basic functions (for example to implement 'payments').
As external event are supplied by oracles we need to apply additional rules for event data formats (which are oracle formats).
Miners could perform evaluation of state machine (check for events and state transitions) who could take some tx fee as a reward.
---
For which applications is the FSM CC?
In this codeproject example for each FSM application it should be created a specific event and state code (like for motor or centrifuge FSMs in the example).
Do we think that we could provide some set of event and state functions in the which could be used for many FSM configurations?
Is there a specific application domain for which we provide this FSM CC? (That is, we do not want to allow to make a 'Motor State Machine' like in the example, and if this is only about coins or tokens it is easier to develop a some function set for the FSM CC)?
Or maybe we could allow to attach some library to the FSM CC with externally defined event and state processing functions?";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"25-Oct-19 07:25 PM";"---
To manage events I think it is good to use 1of2 address 'FSM CC global address' + 'FSM initial txid address', so miners could send events (probably not events, but state transitions) between FSMs instances.
---
A FSM CC config could be a json which defines a state list, events and state transition map (similar to the example) and also binds an oracle txid.
Events are triggered by oracles data and miners create a state transition transactions.";"";"";

We need to define and implement a comprehensive set of blockchain events as the idea is to make the FSM CC and then after that essentially any logic can be implemented. standardizing the arguments and return values will allow creation of complex events and actions, though if all actions are built in, there is no need to make those nested.";"";"";
