I mean something like this:

1. issuer creates 2 new coins, BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012
2. issuer sells this coins on AtomicDEX
3. when a put (BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012) is bought, issuer must deposit USDC into a contract address
4. when a call (BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012) is bought, issuer must deposit BTC into a contract address
5. on expiry date (30.12.) the holders of BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 or BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 are paid out automatically from the contract address
   - all the BTCs are sold for USDC
   - the difference between strike price (8000) and real price in USDC is paid out to either the holders of BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 or BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012

BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 can be traded all the time, but 3. and 4. must only be done once (on first transfer from issuer to buyer), so maybe it is easier to do 1., 3. and 4. in one step, so that BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 coins are only created when the USDC/BTC deposits have been done.";"";"";

the reason pubkeys are used for Antara modules is because thay are the raw form and needed for validating any kind of signature.
 even with addresses, to validate a signature, the pubkey needs to be submitted
