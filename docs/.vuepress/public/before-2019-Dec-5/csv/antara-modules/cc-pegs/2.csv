In addition to the direct risk of instability, our dynamics results suggest a profitable economic attack during extreme events that can induce volatility in the stable asset. This attack additionally suggests ways in which stablecoins can cause perverse incentives for miners, posing risks to blockchain consensus. `";"";"";

For those who are not familiar with PegsCC, it is basically a mechanism to have a coin that is always backed by other crypto at worst 1:1 but it should be more - stablecoin. People deposit some other crypto (lets say KMD,BTC ...) using gateways CC in external chain and get tokens on pegs chain. So now tokens can be deposited in an account and you can take coins in amount of price_of_token*amount (up to 80% of value). Lets call this chain KUSD (1 KUSD should represent 1$) , so with deposit of 100KMD in gateway you'll get 100KMDT, and you can then deposit 100KMDT in account on KUSD chain and take lets say maximum of 120KUSD (KMD=1.5$). When the price changes, if it goes up you can take more KUSD, but if it goes down there is the problem. It is solved with possibility for other users to liquidate worst accounts that are in ""debt"" 90% or more with a gain of 5%. So in previous example if KMD price is 1.3333$ then 120KUSD is 90% of 133.33$ and this account can be liquidated. Some other user gives 120KUSD and gets 95KMDT (it is worth 126.66$), and 5KMDT goes to the system to improve the overall ""debt"" of the system. The account holder which had his account liquidated is left with his 120KUSD so he is in loss of 10% because he has not maintained better ratio on his account. This way all coins should be backed by crypto all the time.";"";"";

In order to get started you will need to mine few blocks so you have for txfee for gatewaysdeposit and gatewaysclaim transactions (20k sat). You can use the gateways TUI from here https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python to send KMD to deposit address and make deposit and claim tx. After having some balance of KMDT, you can do pegsfund to deposit and then pegsget to take KUSD coins.";"";"";
