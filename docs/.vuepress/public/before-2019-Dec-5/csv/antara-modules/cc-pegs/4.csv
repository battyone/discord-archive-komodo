Why the question, the inverse  contract in the derivative exchanges with the leverage of 1x   short practically does not have the price of liquidation - the approximate price of a margin call is about 1 $ million per 1 BTC. Are we SAFU ? Below is an explanation of my question.


When you are trading BTC on Deribit or Bitmex, you are using the inverse futures contracts. Perpetual and the 2 other quarterly futures contracts are inverse.

So on inverse USD/BTC it’s quoted at BTC/USD and the chart also shown as BTC/USD.

Short on inverse 1x leverage to lock-in USD (hedge)
When opening a 1x leverage short on an inverse futures contract, you will “lock-in” the USD value. This is why many professional traders short BTC on an inverse futures contract. It’s a great hedge. When you’re short with 1x leverage on an inverse futures contract, it’s almost impossible to get margin called. You could enter a short at $10k and BTC could move to 1 million dollar and you would still not be margin called. This is great for hedging.
Your short position with 1x leverage is always worth the amount of dollars because when you short on BTC/USD on an inverse futures contract, you are actually long on USD/BTC. You actually buy an amount of USD priced in BTC

If the price goes far above $1.00 then it is a failed peg in a sense, at a minimum, those at risk of Liquidation. Now, it's 2018, price is falling, the Liquidators want KUSD (but ran out after the 1st month of liquidating), the ones about to be Liquidated want KUSD (and can't find any), and the ones wanting to Hedge the 2 yr fall in price don't want to sell.

Everything might freeze for a while if the crash is bad enough. But... this is more or less as intended. Those who short at the right time do well, those who went long do poorly, and the Liquidators are effectively market makers that make bank while things are roaring and very little when no trading is occurring.";"";"";
