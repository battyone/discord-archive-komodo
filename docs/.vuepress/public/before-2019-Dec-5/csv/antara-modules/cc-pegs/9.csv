When you deposit the funds in pegscc account, let say your example of 3000KMD, you are able to get up to 80% of value of your deposit at that moment. So if price of gold is 1500 KMD (we will avoid USD as JL mentioned we can have direct price but lets say 1 KMD 1$ so if 1500$ is the price of gold then lets say at that moment price of gold in KMD is 1500), you can get maximum 1.6 KGOLD. Again let take your example that you took 1 KGOLD, now the price went up, if you want to get back to KMD, you will get back your deposit so 3000KMD there is no 900KMD.
PegsCC must be looked as a mechanisom of deposit vs. borrow. You give the bank your house and take 200k$ loan, when you return the loan you get back the house.";"";"";

"424224648889106444";"Mihailo#5902";"24-Oct-19 09:03 AM";"The problem gose when price goes down. If it goes up you can always take more KGOLD if you want (not necessary). But if it goes down, then you would need to return, but instead of making a system which would burn coins and take it from users, this system works that someone can repay your debt and take your deposit. Then you are left with your KGOLD and you can exchange it for KMD, but you lost some of it as now the price is lower and you cannot get as much as you deposited.";"";"";
