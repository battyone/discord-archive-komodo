I have reached out to individual projects within KMD ecosystem before but thought it best to interact with you guys directly.

We wish to position ourselves as 'One Stop exchange' for all privacy coins. For liquidity provision we have partnered with HUOBI & XRP market-makers. As a DEX we do not plan to charge listing fee for KMD or its asset chains. 

Happy to give contact information so we can discuss about this more with a developer from team, perhaps jl777?  Looking forward to cooperating! 

------
Short tldr;  ResDEX uses instant atomic swaps (within 30 sec trades at the moment) for decentralized trading (using RES as collateral) and zk-Snarks for Privacy.
TOR routing is supported natively as well on ResDEX.  RES coin itself is CPU mineable through yespower algo (rewards split between 30% Proof of Research, 30% Proof of Work, 30% Masternodes & 10% for development)  and anyone can check out working prototype for POR through https://respool.io/

Kasper from Guts was in a Dutch broadcast yesterday. He said that they had choosen for Ethereum because that was the only one with a smart contract at that time. Whether they experienced limits on Ethereum, the answer was yes and no.

He told that there are indeed better blockchains at the moment, but that they do not want to choose a blockchain too early. They do not want to focus on Komodo or another one yet. Komodo, because of the high transactions would possible be a good reason he said, but they first want to look at how they can use the blockchain. Which applications are needed and only then see which chain fits the best for them.

He said: Why choose Komodo, consider because of the high transaction could be a reason but do we need it or can we do it smarter.

He really needs to do some homework I think! üòÄ";"";"";
