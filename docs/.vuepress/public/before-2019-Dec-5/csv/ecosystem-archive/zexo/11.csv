1.  Zaddex team is about 3 people. 2 customer facing, 1 core dev.
2. Claims to have centralised exchange engine done, which will be open sourced? When?
3. Do you have any expected timeline to provide technical details on Both Centralised Exchange and Decentralised Exchange?
4. Since no username provided for core developer, the core developer is not here on this discord? How is this developer learning CC tech then? Since this dev is anonymous already, and in case the dev is here on this discord, can you please give the dev's username?";"";"";

Updates to follow. 3. Centralised very soon. DEX is dependent on exact route as there are technical and legal considerations so we will build with both in mind. 4. The priority at the moment is the centralised exchange and we will absolutely make this available. 5. All of the Github information is being worked on over the next 48 hours and will be updated shortly. We thank you for your patience and understanding.";"";"";

I have to be honest here @Machgielis 

I still don't have any confidence on Zaddex project.

1. I don't know ANYTHING about team.
2. I don't know What code history the developers has made to assess by checking on the code quality and how well things work in developer side.
3. I don't know ANYTHING other than the *""soon""* for technical details.

To me it is *VERY DANGEROUS* to do any exchange (buy/sell) of $ZEX token on current or any Centralised Exchange until the team provides technical details on the project, and also shows the in-progress source code or working source code, along with the core developer to answer further questions.";"";"";
