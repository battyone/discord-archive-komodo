Let's say that Alice has 800 Ravencoin (RVN) and Bob has 450 EnJin (ENJ erc20) and they want to swap them, how can they proceed? They don't know each other. Neither can't risk to send first. There are many stories of people getting scammed while trading privately. They will have to find someone with an excellent reputation who will act as escrow. This is an inconvenient procedure that takes time, risk and high fees. Barterlly offers a fast and simple alternative: Alice can setup a private trade of 800 RVN <-> 450 ENJ and send the link to Bob. Once both sides have deposited their coins, Barterlly makes the swap (or refunds if anything goes wrong).";"";"";

We are preparing the next update, that may take a bit of time to deploy, and redirected the app / website / templates to a temporary provider. The error you will encounter is linked to HSTS and is totally normal. A fix can be done here : https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/
We processed a full refund on all assets currently listed on the platform, as it may take time, and we don't want to do anything in a rush, we prefered to get every user having still funds on the platform refunded before the downtime.
We don't give a date for reopening yet, as we will first focus on implementing everything on the new infrastructure on our dev nodes, and add every features we developped dring the past monthes.
We will also use that time to search for investors, that will help us make this journey a success. The GUI is ready to go to the next level, as the core, and we really want it to get properly done.
See you soon !";"";"";

New code also allow to handle any type of coin, be it Z, XTZ, Monero and any chain.

Unfortunately, after all revelations about tech stuff on KMD, I personally am not seen as a good relation anymore. I just hope people won't be shocked discovering all I tried to do to improve the ecosystem, and was just seen as bad actions, whereas it was done to avoid multiple mistakes that were done by the past, and that could just destroy the credibility of KMD's marvellous ideology and project.

We invested monthes of our time without any tech support or financial one, some guys helped, thanks @KomodoWorld for all you have done for us but unfortunately, we can t wait anymore for a real funding coming from the ecosystem.";"";"";
"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"18-Aug-19 11:37 AM";"To launch the platform fully, we need to be fully compliant, but don't have the funds to achieve this. The opportunity is huge, but we can t afford costs without a proper investor.
Discussions were started monthes ago, but no clear but wait answer was given.

We have no choice but to go on totally limited version. Our code is safe, real, as people tried it and enjoyed it. Templating and API and wallet integration are really mind blowing. But we can t achieve this alone.

Whitelabel solutions were also done and could have helped KMD ecosystem a lot, notably by adding stablecoins, and involving brokers. 

Lack of financial help led us to this.
We will try to come back, and search for real investors, and will detach from KMD progressively, as it doesn't respect our fairness and transparency standards.

This is an open call : we are actively searching for a real investor that want to take advantage of our automated escrow solution.
Private tests showing our skills and the adaptability of our solution will be possible for interested investors.

Being honest is what will transform and make this journey a success.

See you soon ;)";"";"";
