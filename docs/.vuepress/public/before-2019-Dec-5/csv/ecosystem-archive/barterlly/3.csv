"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"21-Oct-18 02:35 AM";"ok, some news about cancellation of orders, 

Whatever the state of the trade, as long as the funds are not received on generated addresses, users can ask for a REFUND.

The logic is : 

Whoever asked for the cancel of order is handled, receiver, or sender, depending of the originator, the status move won t go by the same path : 

Status codes : 
//0 : new trade
//1 : sender confirmed the trade
//2 : receiver confirmed the trade
//3 : both confirmed, waiting for funding from both side
//4 : sender funding tx received
//5 : receiver funding tx received
//6 : both funding tx received
//7 : Swap done sender side
//8 : Swap done receiver side
//10 : Swap Complete !
//21 : Sender Cancelled
//22 : Receiver Cancelled
//25 : Sender cancelled, and both were refunded
//26 : Receiver cancelled, and both are refunded
//27 : Sender cancelled, sender refunded
//28 : Receiver cancelled, sender refunded
//29 : Sender cancelled, receiver refunded
//30 : Receiver cancelled, receiver refunded


Basically, when a trade is cancelled, the scripts will check during a finite amount of time that any other part didn t send in the meantime. If that's the case, the tx and amount received during the cancellation will be used to refund on a refund address (with specific dialog box when cancelling the trade). When this time is passed (maybe 2 days to begin), or whenever the side not refunded clicks as : it s ok, the trade isn t fetched anymore.";"";"";
"456226577798135808";"Deleted User#0000";"21-Oct-18 02:35 AM";"The amount of refund will be correlated to the amount received, this will have multiple advantages : If a sender wants to send via multiple tx, that will be possible, the agreeing about the deal will only happen when amounts are matched. A security is done that will ONLY send the amount if it matches exactly the trade, in the case it isn t the case, it will stay stuck until one side or other cancels it and triggers the global refunding.

Another point about that part, is the cancelling of an order will launch a modal to give the refund address. Why this : just because it s too risky to base only on originator address, as it can be multiple if the amount is gathered via multiple txes, the other point is that in case of private addresses, we can't know the originator address, and in the global scheme, the user don't need to input his refund address.  This step being optional, it will prevent people from being lost";"";"";
