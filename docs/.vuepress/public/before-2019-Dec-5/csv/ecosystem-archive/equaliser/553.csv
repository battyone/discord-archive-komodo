Exact details, we'll work out. We've been talking to some people and amongst ourselves, and this seems the best way to build value in the short term. Right now, smart contracts are a programmers nightmare, and just plain unusable by the general public. If we can make a strong solution for that, we're in business. 
That, in turn, will drive the price, and that will get funding to get back to the basic goals we started this train with ðŸ˜„";"";"";

We don't have to start from the back end, just the front. The bad thing is neither Cypher or I are great programmers. He's a lot better than me. I'm an old school cracker. Got a lot to learn for modern languages. So, assuming the vote continues the way it is, we need some solid UI programmers.   Particularly, people who are good with Java and/or C++ would be quite helpful. We'll likely make it a bounty project. We will also be using the Agile method to do sprints, so we don't have the mass confusion of the past.";"";"";
