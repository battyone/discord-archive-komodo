Our first order of business, starting tomorrow, will be to come up with a rough schedule and a few initial goals. The more people we can get involved with the goals, the faster they will go, but we are going to lay out a tentative roadmap that's based on a realistic timeframe with only the two of us in overall charge of the project. This likely means weekly meetings and weekly goals. We will be using the Agile framework to measure, evaluate, and meet these goals.";"";"";

Cypher and I are meeting tomorrow to come up  with when we can work and a tentative set of goals. When we get that far, we'll be inviting some of you to a separate server for a bit more in depth meeting. This isn't secret, it's just about team building. Some of you will want in, some of you won't, and that's cool either way.";"";"";

Creating hype right now is probably counterproductive. I'm guessing, as we haven't got details yet, but I'd suspect about a 60 day timeline to the point where we'll get aggressive again.";"";"";

So, we're going to be working on this primarily on our day off, which for me is Sunday. We'll lay out projects and time frames, but until things get turned around, it's going to be a long process. If we can get ahead of schedule at any time, you best believe we will, but the new direction will be ""Slow and steady wins the race"".
