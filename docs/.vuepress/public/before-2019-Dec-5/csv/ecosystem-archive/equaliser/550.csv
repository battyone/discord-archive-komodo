Too much interference of economic cycles can have devastating effects like runaway inflation. Given that Australian wages have been stagnant in growth for the past 7 or so years and more M3 broad money supply has been introduced into the system from excessive loans and mortgages from banks, if velocity slows such as people reducing spending in the economy in order to service debt obligations, and then government introduces QE to make up for reduced lending by banks, it is going to perpetuate the problem. I had written something a few years ago about the consequences of Australian style QE  however, it came to fruition by proxy with the lax regulation of bank lending. Why wont politicians realise that a correction needs to happen and sure it will be recession but rapid population growth is not the answer. Problem we have is that no one wants to be government in power when a correction happens.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"16-Feb-19 12:11 AM";"[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> reason is that 15- 20% of even a cheapy property of $600k is around $90k. By the time the person saves $90k over a few years then the price of that cheap property has now risen to $1M and now 15% of that is now $150k.   It keeps getting further and further escaping from them. I recommended that if they want to buy then just get out of Sydney. They're stuck doing IT though and most IT jobs are in Sydney.  Some are in Mel but that's almost as expensive.  I recommend they move to Brisbane. Still has some IT jobs and better standard of living being able to live closer to work.";"";"";

That the Proof of Concept. At work, whenever we do something new we do a POC. People don't focus much energy until the POC is complete and its proven that the approach and method will work, then it's full steam ahead.  Might be same here. Once the POC is completed and investors will come knocking.";"";"";

Rapid population growth which will have major social problems and shrinking wages further perpetuating debt and mortgage stress among households. The only option is to hold on for a bumpy ride and allow economic cycles to naturally run their course. Or print more money with QE and cause runaway inflation.
