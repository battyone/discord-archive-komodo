"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"11-Jul-18 05:17 PM";"[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe established property investment has become property consumption for total speculation. It is a non-productive spend and negative gearing is removing potential income for government to put back into the economy because essentially our government is borrowing more and more money which is a given now we have the lowest cash rates in history. This is all not going to end well if the government doesn't recognise and intervene the state we are in. It will be difficult also given that the last time I checked, Australian federal politicians owned approx $370M worth of property investments and didn't include holiday properties. But any way to kick the can as long as possible will be preferred and it's getting to the point it might be too late. If I was a property investor, I would sell as much as possible to pay off favourite properties and own them outright. This too will cause an increase of housing stock and lead to further property price correction. Everywhere is a catch 22 situation unfortunately.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"11-Jul-18 05:19 PM";"[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone can use EQLI to purchase a home to build, we dont discriminate. Just some background info, in Australia, the deposit just to get a mortgage is between 10-20% and house prices vary up to almost $1M depending on hosehold income such as 2 adult incomes that pass the test to be loaned that amount. For a half decent home 2-3 bedroom about 400k to 600k. It is difficult to find one for less than 300k. That being said, i have for the past half decade have been insisting that house prices are becoming extremely inflated and mortgage stress and household debt will become too much for the economy to bear and will have a negative effect for everyone. The banks have also been lending out more in mortgages than people are able to service. Politicians own collectively $370M in investment property and people are allowed to hoard multiple properties using an interest only mortgage and a tax benefit that was brought in during the 80's when interest rates were above 10% The tax benefit was to stimulate housing investment to in turn stimulate building and jobs in construction. Now that many countries and Australia have the lowest rates in history, the tax benefit is out dated and is detrimental to the broader economy. The tax benefit allows property investors to claim losses against an investment property to pay less income tax and also reduces government income to put towards the economy, infrastructure, job incentives schemes, etc and with the ratio of  first home buyers dropping, not just in australia, but developed countries too. And I havent even mentioned the increasing number of people falling below the poverty line. In the 21st century, the middle class is shrinking.";"";"";

Equaliser won't contribute to already inflated established property market prices and a fraction of profits are used for helping those in natural disasters and also subsidies for some that need assistance owning a home. 

A build is commissioned with the purchase in EQLI, there is no competition between those with wealth and those that struggle to save for a deposit on a mortgage.
