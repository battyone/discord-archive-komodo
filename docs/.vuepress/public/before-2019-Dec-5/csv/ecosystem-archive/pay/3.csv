As Neo bankers, we decided to issue this cryptocurrency for anyone who needs
a stable, tradable unit. One application of Komodo Stable Bonds financial services which include payments (debit and credit cards), savings and lending capabilities. Our
payment solutions are independent services and naturally compliment KSB ‚Äì
providing flexibility on how the loans can be spent.

3.1 Function 1 - A Unit of Account, measurement of value
A unit of account is something that can be used to value goods and services,
record debts, and make calculations. In other words, it‚Äôs a measurement for
the value used to represent the real value (or cost) of any economic item; i.e.
goods, services, assets, liabilities, income, expenses. It is one of three well-known
functions of money. It lends meaning to profits, losses, liability, or assets.

"474623016295464964";"zaddex#2546";"21-Mar-19 05:32 PM";"to answer few questions:
Here are some communication about where we are at.
The PLAN:
Zaddex will have its license in Estonia to operate its crypto to crypto and it crypto to fiat
we will list valuable and meaningful crypto projects with a priority to the komodo ecosystem asset chains
the fiat gateway will include mostly e wallet, instant disbursement (canada/us/australia); classic international wire and domestic wire (ach and sepa)
Zaddex will start support in beta SME launch via Launchpad in West AFrica - official release count down by official <10days
About ZEX we are considering and finalizing the details of an hard fork
As of today here will be the parameters
Supply reduce from 210mio to 100mio
Wallet will have to be updated
Hard fork will likely happen in April
Time to release properly
PoS/PoW: 92.23% - 7.77%
Rewards: 7.77% per year (dicreasing year 2 mechanically)
and 20mio dedicated to business dev , legal and marketing
Burn of coins corresponding to 7.77% per month of profit
The 60mio supply (100-mined supply)
Will be use for dev (33%) and business dev and legal (66.66%)
As of today we would like to also support margin trading of KMD but not sure need to make sure that it regulatory possible to do so
Pending final signature OCU (OUR) is the parent company of Zaddex (50% equity)
And will handle the ZEX assets
We have been consider transactional mining to promote the listed assets nothing fix as of today
Idea üí° and contributions will be more than welcome
Tip bots will be put in place for both OUR and ZEX in the coming days
Thanks for your attention
