Joining discord could also be manipulted this way, and adds no value. Tipping might be better to people having personal blogs and writing some decent articles. But make sense only if planned -> simultaneous articles similar time , like 100 a week in different blogs, media and so on. Must be coordinated. @Dr Debt  the airdrop I would suggest to split by weight of followers, meaning calculate avg weight of retweet to measure share of this 10k USD.
