First, some of this knowledge is necessary to understand Komodo's tech so we want to give ppl the chance to learn about it but we don't want to constantly have to explain it. So we can just link back to posts like these again and again. Second, it will serve some SEO purposes and draw in some organic traffic from Google. Third, we hope to build a large body of educational content about blockchain-related topics so that we can establish Komodo as an authority in the space (we are but ppl may not know that).

- Open source development should be kept separate from the 'for profit' side or 'legal side'
