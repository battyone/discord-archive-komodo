Consensus customization with crypto conditions allows for dApps to be built with access to all parts of the blockchain.

 - the block reward distribution (and probably fancy cryptonomics and governance) Mr Vlad probably dreams of
 - off chain data oracle ized to become part of consensus rules
 - utxo locking for stable coin gateways
 - tokenization of assets
 - instant payment channels, on chain, comparable with lightning network.  Also lockable and therefore exchangeable for other gateway coins, crypto or stable coin, tokenized asset or combinations.
 - fungibility between chains

This is only the beginning too!  Very flexible extensions to v1 and v2 blockchain tech.";"";"";
