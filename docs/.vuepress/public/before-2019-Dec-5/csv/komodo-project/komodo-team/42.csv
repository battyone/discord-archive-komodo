One was from a business standpoint, of trying to keep users locked into it and locked off from the rest of the world. But the other was the technical standpoint. It wanted to make it look like the Network was something you had control over, something you could interact with just like you could with your own data. And it was a lovely idea, but that's all it ever was. The thing itself was never more than a facade. Meanwhile those Internet nerds were off pasting hyperlinks around, doing wreckless things like setting up their own email addresses and adding new things to the network without having to ask anyone first. And despite The Microsoft Network making every object look so real on the outside that you could just squeeze it and watch the AddRefs ooze out, the Web's simple idea of giving every thing a unique readable location won by a mile.

Something like when if they wanted the multicoin wallet with their theme, we basically have it so on opening it has Agama Logo and Xcoin logo and maybe some of their colors (they provide hex#), and it loads up with Xcoin, Komodo, and Bitcoin or something at start, has Jumblr feature built in, etc. 
That way they can get their coin users to download and use it, explore Jumblr, BarterDEX, Agama etc without feeling like they are pushing Komodo products on their users, we instead use BarterDEX, Agama, Jumblr as features and independent brands.
