I knew right off the bat these guys are anti KMD, but never got a clear answer out from them. I finally got it, and of course its around the history of JL777 and the moves from NXT to BTCD and then BTCD to KMD.

I was able to answer the move from NXT to BTCD (NXT devs changed their vision for the project and JL777 decided to move on since it was counter intuitive to what supernet was trying to do)

The move from BTCD was to incorporate ZK Snark technology from ZEC to provide real privacy for supernet and all the projects (from my understanding but not 100% sure about this)

However, I couldn't answer the question of why KMD needed an ICO and where the ICO funds came from. These guys are under the impression that all these moves were money grabs. New ICOs to get more BTC. I know BTCD to KMD was a swap, but there was also an ICO. Does anyone know where the ICO funds came from?

Of course these guys took it a step further to say not only did the project grab more BTC by having another ICO, but BTCD value was hurt when KMD was announced allowing for an easy pump and dump scheme to occur to get even more BTC. Double dipping on the BTCD to KMD swap so to speak

Think it would be nice to be able to answer these concerns of people. A lot of old school people have a negative view of the project and a lot of these old school people have money/influence. Think it would be good to address this stuff in some way";"";"";
"455877490062131200";"ResoluteCrypto#5902";"17-Jul-18 11:10 PM";"thats the question I couldn't answer. If KMD was just an upgrade to BTCD then why was there an ICO for KMD. Think of it like a project launching their own token and getting off of ETH. There is a swap for the ERC20 token for the real coin, but there isn't another ICO";"";"";

 - I don' know how BTCD project got started initially, but when jl777 joined the project (later) there were no funding for it
 - BTCD was envisioned to be part of the NXT system (I call it SuperNET 1.0), so I would say there was just one change from NXT+BTCD -> KMD (but there indeed was a period when the plan was to move everything 100% under BTCD).
 - Komodo was created because of two things 1) privacy and 2) security. The dPoW implementation needed money, and a lot of the ICO budget was put aside for those Bitcoin notarizations that we have been doing everyday since day 1.
 - In general, the whole blockchaini industry keeps evolving very fast, and things must change and change and change. I don't know how anyone could not see that. Thus obviously under SuperNET things have been changing and changing too for our project to stay innovative. However, the vision has always stayed the same. The difference is, that jl777 respects the previous investors and doesn't abondon any project.";"";"👍 (8),✅ (7),Komodo (7)";
