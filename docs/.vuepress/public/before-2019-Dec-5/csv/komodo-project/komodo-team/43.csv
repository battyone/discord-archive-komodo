We've been contacting various KMD AC projects and searching their pages/documents/information to find a word to use for part of the seed. Each word doesn't have to be/or isn't at all related to crypto or even Komodo (this was so normal words could be used and not easily guessed/brute forced with Komodo key words). and we have some directions to find the word in the resources. something like ""Bitcoin/bible/48th word""  which could be interpreted as the 48th word of the Bitcoin White Paper. easy. But not all will be that easy.

We've also gotten commitments from two projects so far to donate coins to the seed wallet which should really up the pot. We are waiting on a few other projects as well and because there is some decent coinage here we did NOT want to make this TOO easy. We are still working out the clues/directions to see if they are too easy/hard but that will be determined later. 

The words locations are picked strategically to get as many eyes on Komodo tech, resources, the AC's, channels, etc. 

Ideally we think that before this goes live we can create some simple posters, and tease the wallet balance on twitter as a ""Seed Scavenger Hunt"" or something. We were going to do riddles, But this seems like a better way because the winner just needs to be able to interpret the clues, find the location, and find the word. It would probably be much better to have the official twitter blast this out when it's time so that we get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible. Another criteria we were thinking was to release the first 6 clues immediately, and when retweets hit a certain point, we release the rest. this way we create an incentive for contestants to actually spread the word.

I think because of the variability in the wallets required (PIRATE needs z address and full node, and Verus isn't in KMD agama, but only Verus Agama) it will be very difficult for the first person to solve all the clues to move all the coins to a safe wallet before someone snatches part of the prize.

This could be part of the game, or we go with a winner takes all style. And this would have us build an actual 24-36 word seed, and only release the first 12 words. the person who finds the first 12 words of the seed and tells us, will receive the rest of the seed and can take their time removing coins or w.e.

So it would be hard to move all the coins out of the exposed address quickly. so for example PIRATE has been chipped in, but that coin ONLY works in Z addresses and needs a full blockchain download. Which makes it not easy to access that wallet. So while multiple people may solve the seed, and the fastest starts removing coins, they may not get all the coins because someone else might take PIRATE, or Verus (which is in a different version of Agama)";"";"";
