For example, when you create an ERC-20 on Eth, you are 100% dependent on the Eth blockchain.
So if the Eth network crashes, your company crashes too.
And if you want to leave the Eth network you have to develop your own blockchain and swap your ERC-20 tokens, as for EOS for example and can make investors lose confidence and it costs millions.. 
I don't know it's just an idea.";"";"";

"403137719049519106";"Audo#5667";"30-Jun-18 12:49 PM";"Thank you for the ideas @jorian , they are good ones.

There definitely is room to improve for us. We should produce content in more regular interwals and maybe our focus on a single campaign has made us blind to some of the things we could have blogged about. Many times, however, we need a bit more time to write about something and often we have hard time understanding the technical aspects and angles.

Example 1: You suggested a blog about *""the creation of several third party ecosystem developers, like DEVSEC, ChainZilla etc.""* ‚Äì This is definitely a blog we will write. The situation is very young still, however. These businesses are just setting themselves up. Also our business development team is planning how we handle this exactly. Thus it's better to wait for the situation to mature, at least in my opinion. A blog about this in 1 month will be just as powerful as it would be today.

Example 2:  *""someone doing a write-up about what the consequences of the ASIC for KMD are""* ‚Äì sounds interesting, but I'm not sure what this is about. Our marketing team needs a better bridge to the technical minds who would feed us content. Indeend, @jorian if you could help us in this perhaps we could talk. We are looking people like you.

Example 3: - *""someone doing a write-up about what ZEC is doing and why or why not KMD is integrating their updates""* ‚Äì the same as above, our resources are limited and it takes a long time for us to understand these in enough detail to blog about them. We need a dedicated technical person to help us out.";"";"";

 ‚Äì¬†A team decision was made not to draw too much attention to our dPoW promise as of yet, because it's in PEN testing and so on. Thus our marketing team has only been able to retweet mentions and not directly blog about it. We will be making a blog post about this in time once we are ready to market this feature. It will still work as we can interview GAME and explain that they have been using our security service for 3 months without any attacks, and so on.";"";"";

 ‚Äì We have been giving the stress test small mentions here and there. However, it has been a conscious decision on our part not to make too much noise about it until the numbers have been validated and the infrastructure is ready. We haven't had any timeline on how long it takes to setup the infrastructure and it is better to make the noice once we know for sure when the actual live marketable stress test will happen.

*""(a short summary of) the advancements in CHIPS and the creation of the CHIPS community""*

1) Yes, our marketing could do better job on few things. We are improving and now we want to get you guys more involved.

2) One problem we have indentified is that Komodo is all over the place ‚Äì¬†and with that we mean the messages we send out through marketing

We are trying to focus on one talking point at a time and build campaigns. Since the ICO our marketing has been reactionary but we want to get to a position when we can plan and anticipate. That means that we are not going to talk about all the ""noice"" that is going on before it is mature enough to be properly marketed (i.e. CHIPS and Assetchain businesses).";"";"";

Next, we need to work out a new landing page the dApp deserves. We might soon have something exciting to announce as Steve has been talking with one Agency who is going to help us build THE BEST multi-coin wallet on the industry. 

According to Steve, these guys are extremely excited about Komodo tech.";"";"";
