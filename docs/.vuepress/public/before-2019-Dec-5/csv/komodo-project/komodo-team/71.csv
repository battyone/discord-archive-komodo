As PTYX just mentioned, ChainZilla is one of our Komodo service providers. That is one option.

The other service provider we have is Luis Garcia @siu - Chainmakers  who runs ChainMakers. You can view their website here:

The first paragraph is extremely negative. This is intentional. It provides strong contrast between 1st and 2nd paragraphs, and highlights the importance of Komodo's solution.";"";"";
"415903995547090956";"Daniel CP#2020";"03-Feb-19 08:15 AM";"In general, in copywriting, you want to clearly identify the problem and your ""customer's pain points"" in the parlance of the industry. The formula is generally explain the problem--> identify the  ways that this is problem is impacting your customer's life--> present the solution --> explain the benefits of the solution and how much better your customer's life will be after the buy your product/service

If a 51% attack is not something that a person has ever thought about or worries about, then Komodo's Blockchain Security Service is not for them. If they have worried about a 51% attack, then we essentially want to harness that negative emotion for a brief moment before introducing Komodo's solution";"";"";

You've suggested several different solutions and then present Komodo's as the best one. This method is a bit trickier and requires much more analysis. Right now, Komodo has the only third-party security solution in the blockchain space so mentioning other ways of mitigating the risk of a 51% attack probably isn't the way we want to do things.

But for ordinary potential customers, I'd say we have somewhere between 1 and 2 minutes of people's attention before they move on to something else. 

In those 60--120 seconds, what do we want them to learn?

-- 51% attacks are a serious problem. More than $23 Million has been stolen in 51% attacks in the last 12 months 
-- Komodo has a third-party solution that protects any UTXO-based blockchain with the power of the BTC network
