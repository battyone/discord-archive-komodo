What do you think about bisq fiatgateway? I understood it like this:
Alice Bob and an arbitrator have a 2 of 3 multisig address. Lets assume Alice has crypto, Bob fiat. Alice puts an order. Bob want to fill it. 
He makes a small securitydeposit in crypto to a timelocked address with the condition that Bob can withdraw if time is over or an arbitrator can transfer just to Alice. 
Alice make payment to the 2 of 3 multisig address. 
Bob makes fiat transfer to her bankaccount
After receiving, Alice sign tx from multisigaddress to Bob-> Bob can get crypto

If Bob doesnt do the fiattransfer, Alice consult arbitrator.
Arbitrator check evidence and eventually sign funds from multisig back to Alice and small Bob deposit as well.  As well if Alice got fiat and doesnt sign, Bob can complain and get 

I find the concept not bad. At least better than the visa/mastercard fiat gateway resistance is using which requires kyc. Its a bit tricky with the arbitrators, they have to be trusted, somehow chosen and in the idle case noone of the participants. An idea is to chose one randomly of a list of elected arbitrators similar to notary nodes and show both participants his telegramlink or something like that. A small fee for arbitration is an option.";"";"";
