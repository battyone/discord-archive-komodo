ProtonMail improvements
ProtonVPN improvements

This was on a Protonmail survey, I'm pretty sure we already reach out to them (as probably a lot of other projects do) but there may be a multicoin wallet we can offer, as well as of course pushing them to acknowledge dPoW notarizations and some ecosystem projects.";"";"";

IBM Blockchain World Wire is a cross-country payment system. 
the reason why large companies can take the initiative in what international organizations will do is because of blockchain. 
just as the Internet has approached the public under the name of the World Wide Web (WWW), IBM's WorldWire (WW) may be the first blockchain used by global citizens.

on top of the innovation driven by the Internet and smartphones, a payment war is underway for global IT companies. IT companies such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Alibaba, Facebook and Twitter all have entered the war with their respective weapons or are choosing to breathe in to jump in. the war began with the replacement of credit cards, initially called plastic money. but the Internet has no borders, so the goal of a payment war will inevitably result in creating an Internet currency that can transcend borders. the standard position is glorious, but the war is fierce because it is cramped.

numerous assets on the blockchain trustless platform will gain monetary status, but roughly 2 percent short of global identification. money is global, but if you can't identify who it is, the existing financial network, credit cards, which also confirm who it is, may be better.";"";"";

When i first dug into Bitcoin, there was something that was simply unacceptable in mainstream economic thinking. 

So i asked myself a simple question and wanted to make a decision. 

Can the government stop it? 
It seemed self-evident that the government would try to stop it if it could. 

But what if you can't stop it? 

Of course, not all of them, but I thought there must be a government on the planet led by the elite who thought they should lead if they can't stop it.
