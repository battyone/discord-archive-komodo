docs, dex app, multi-coin wallet, chain generator, application logic on chain, anti fud, dpow, mm2 = rebrand
all the work has to align so it's an appealing project to adopt.
some of the code is still being tested, so knowing what is marketable & usable is a 2-way street.
there's a lot of tech, and the rebrand is part of the new standard in blockchain tech.
james made some incredible stuff happen over the last 3 years that built on the previous 3 years.
komodo has one last hard fork to come and new notaries before it's never looking back.   imo anyway.
a) don't want brown sheets
b) don't want vapourware
c) want to manage people's expectations that use the tech
if you are not using the tech, ask questions how to use it.  spin up your own blockchains, make a tokendex, lock up some of your custom coins for rewards like a masternode network.
there is a crypto price competition to do with the prices of forex, stocks and other cryptos that some of the techs are working on as well.   prices of stocks & forex in crypto, all blockchain enforced.";"";"";

yeah forums are good, one of my tasks is how to integrate it more effectively.   initially i had created a demo community site with single sign on with the forum - this was not originally unleashed because of the above - aligning everything so it all is a cohesive message.

the earliest versions of a cohesive message were mid 2018, komodo lowers the barriers to blockchain adoption, you spin up your chain, you get your coins into a wallet, you get listed on a dex.   the message now is you get security, scalability and a bunch of new stuff out of the box.";"";"";

money that pirates demand for ransom is called ""real money,"" and the money that pirates recognize is a source of imagination: Trustless Trust. 

argument that bitcoin should be eliminated because criminals use bitcoin is logically not far from the idea that Venice's money should be removed because pirates have acknowledged it.

""bitcoin phenomenon,"" a strange phenomenon faced by mankind today, is different from the new industrial technology commonly referred to as blockchain. this phenomenon is clear and humanistic intellectuals who have missed bitcoin must admit that they have a narrow understanding of the source of the currency.

today, the complex international relations we face also have to do with changes in the marine order. bitcoin also exists as a result of the old order, although it may be the cause of the new international order.

I wanted to shoot out a message to members of the Komodo team and community to see if you would be interested in recording a podcast for my week long podcast series of the Komodo Project. 

I recorded a podcast with two Komodo team members several weeks ago and it was a big success. Many people contacted me asking to create more episodes and I would love to bring on anyone who is interested. Here is a list of topics I would like to create a podcast over, each topic would be its own podcast:

-Why Komodo is a better blockchain solution
   --Blockchain difficulties, scaling issues, problems Komodo solves, etc

-Antara
  --What Antara is, it's frame work, smart-chains, why its a superior solution, etc.

-Komodo economics
  --Token supply, POS, staking, price outlook, scarcity, etc.

- How to customize your blockchain
   --How its done, why its important, how business can adopt this solution, etc

-Blockchain Web app on AWS
   --How to use it, how business can adopt it, etc

PM me if interested or shoot me an email at drew@crusayder.com";"";"üëç (1)";
