https://twitter.com/minliangtan/status/1021564383258759169

anyway, he posted an update about Razer E-Payment proposal for Singapore:
https://www.razer.com/sg-en/epayments-proposal

In particular pay note to ""Accordingly, as we do not see any third-party consumer e-payment provider that is gaining traction, we plan to launch Razer Pay in Singapore by Q1 2019. ""
https://www.facebook.com/notes/min-liang-tan/e-payments-proposal-singapore-an-update/2023698290983945/

Which indicates that they are in-fact likely to move forward with launching Razer Pay and I can't think of a truly better platform to launch on than Komodo. I'm hoping we can reach out in an official capacity and attempt to woo them to look at Komodo or build upon it. 

Not sure how many of our devs use Razer products but it would be a nice side note in addition to the obvious benefits our platform has. Figured this would be a good lead to reach out to, Min-Liang mentioned getting a lot of shoutouts about building on XRP but XRP is not nearly scalable to nationstate payment processing, nor should a nation share infrastructure and therefore be subjected to limitations simply because someone else on the channel is bigger than they are.";"";"";
