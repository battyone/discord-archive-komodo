Yes, thank you for the feedback. The instructions are to first warn and then mute if a warning is ignored. There are edge cases and in this case this guy was clearly frustrated and started spamming channels. I agree with @farl that a short mute & warning was good, like he did. I don't see any issue here.

If we need to continue this discussion let's do it on #discord-feedback";"";"";

i just read the atomicdex stress test result announcement.   i used to load test national inbound call centres for carriers with custom software and reading @ca333 's message is great to read.  the dev of the atomic dex network, to maximize the swap-ability up until this point, that enabled ppl to work with the beta product, to see it in action has been very useful - ppl can see the magic working.

to now turn the screws on optimizations at network level is next-level professionalism.

Here is the info on hte underlying p2p network as written by the devs!
