it was designed to do atomic swaps and order matching, along the way SPV to be added. so it achieved more than it originally set out to do. from a cli basis, it works pretty well. any sort of multithreaded and queueing ability can be added ON TOP of mm1, which is what is required to create a performant multithreaded system. With a multithreaded overlay and queuing of requests to native mode, it would work, but then people want multithreaded and SPV servers....
that runs into the problem that SPV servers are slow, much slower as compared to native. mm1 served its purpose, it blazed the trail and showed it is possible to make a decentralized orderbook cleared via atomic swaps. the utxo issue is probably more of a hindrance than the single threaded issue for the daemon level.
