I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction as far as written documentation concerning POS Staking on the KMD platform. It would be nice if it had examples too. IE What happens when staking off one input, vs the 64 input max. If there are split stake thresholds, etc. I suppose a document on UTXO's, SegID's, etc. would also help in trying to explain staking on KMD.";"";"";
