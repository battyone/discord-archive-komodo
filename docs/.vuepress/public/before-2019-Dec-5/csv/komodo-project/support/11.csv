and ac_reward=3 coins

After the second block gets mined and assuming all block rewards and the premine of 270000000 go to the same node, will that node now have two utxo's like this:
utxo #1: 270000000
utxo #2:                   3

Giving a balance of 270000003.

Then after the 3rd block gets mined will that node now have 3 utxos like this:

utxo #1: 270000000
utxo #2:                   3
utxo #3:                   3

Giving a balance of 270000006 coins for that node.";"";"";
