I am getting no output with regards to ABP, while wallet is running on the instance.

When changing the port back to 7783 for ABP I get this result

I really appreciate your guidance in this matter. I think it may have to do with ABP's coin integration, as we have submitted all info to the jl777c/coins repo.
