We recommend moving all funds (all different coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Paper Wallet - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPaperWalletGenerator/archive/master.zip
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2.  You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)";"";"";
