Posting so hopefully others won't make the same mistake, and to make it easier for support if someone comes in with a similar problem.
At the time I was consolidating funds to send.  Using `z_sendmany` and `z_mergetoaddress`.
On one of the `z_mergetoaddress`es I put an amount at the end of the command, as I had been doing for `z_sendmany`.
Unfortunately, in  this case, a number at the end of `z_mergetoaddress` is the miners fee ü§¶ 
Not a good idea to rush through things and get complacent!
