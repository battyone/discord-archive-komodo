A bit of background....I rebooted my system after the coins were pulled out of my wallet and created a new agama verus wallet. I didn't know I had to pull out the existing funds. But either way I was not able to to access my wallet as it went blank and so I rebooted the system and created the new wallet . However my last address where the funds were pulled out I do not have the  seed phrase. I have the pin pasword.  Back in March I created Agama wallet and  moved my KMD coins into it and have the seed phrase. Then I moved them all out into my binance exchange. However, I decided to go back into KMD coin and bought a lot and went back to my wallet typing the seed phrase (not copying and pasting)...and it gave me a different address but I didn't realize that this address was not the same as my oriignial address. So I don't know what letter or space is dfifferent from my original seed phrase. I did a restore point and was able tto access the wallet with the pin word but then goes blank. I contacted the support team and they told me to try the pin file to move...tried that and still can't access my wallet in agama verus to get the seed word. I feel hopeless. Any help would be appreciated.";"";"";
