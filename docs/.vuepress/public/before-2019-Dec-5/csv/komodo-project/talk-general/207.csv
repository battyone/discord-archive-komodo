```
a) run a snapshot on height X (which gets announced as snapshot-height)
b) create new AC chain with coin-cap of a)
c) run a bunch of sendtomany to distribute the coins according to a)
d) ensure the users can access their tokens with their old privkey - so might have to provide a simple tool to calc KMD WIF out of snapshotchain (origin) WIF

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  In reference to BarterDEX GUI: One of the most important things you and @hyperDEX  can do is have an available help file. Either you can hover over each clickable icon and a pop-up explains what it is, or perhaps a clickable question mark next to each where a text file (that downloaded with the program) pops up and tells you what each icon does.  This will help with the learning curve and cut down on the same questions being asked over and over again.";"";"";
