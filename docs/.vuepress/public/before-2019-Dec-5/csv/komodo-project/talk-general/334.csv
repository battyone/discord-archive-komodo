With that in mind, how did the dev team sweep all of the coins from wallets that haven't been opened? I personally had not opened my wallet in 3 weeks, yet my funds were swept to the ""safe"" wallet. How is that possible without another backdoor that the dev team was sitting on?

Second, how are they going to verify ownership of the swept funds? Right now they are only asking for email-coin-address-amount-txid I assume they will ask for the seed/keys to verify ownership before dispersing funds. But, if the attacker has the keys to wallets that were swept, can't the hacker just claim the swept funds by using multiple email addresses?
