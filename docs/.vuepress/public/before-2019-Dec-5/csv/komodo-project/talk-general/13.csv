And BarterDEX is that truely decentralised exchange, so far that I know of. Not sure if there's any other On-Chain atomic swap tech out there which covers both major coin protocols (BTC & ETH) in market.

TL;DR: BarterDEX does ANY to ANY coin pair trades. There is NO single coin specific set in it. It's another matter that right now there are more KMD users who understand and knows about it, so KMD pairs are more in BarterDEX. As easy UI projects like HyperDEX and dICOApps and others from ChainZilla will be out there'll be more trading pairs.

Also, as of now BTC is dominant in total market, so in my views it is best if we have more trade pairs available.
Having fiat gateway's linked to BarterDEX would be another advantage, not a disadvantage.
Everyone wants to exit the banks cartel who understand how they slave people, and having fiat gateways is the best, however they link to cryptocurrency world.
and if got linked to DEX, it's the other level up best!";"";"";
