Sia's decision is unique, however, in that the goal is not to keep ASICs off the network entirely – Vorick has written that this is a losing battle and diminishes a coin's security – but to block ASICs made by particular companies.

If Innosilicon and Bitmain move as fast as possible to produce new hardware, Vorick told CoinDesk, they may be able to replace the bricked ASICs in three or four months. In the interim, then, miners sold by Sia's sister venture Obelisk will have the run of the network.";"";"";
