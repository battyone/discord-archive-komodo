there should be no difference in costs for the moment

this option is about the future

non-fungible interoperability cluster - all the smartchains in the same cluster that are notarised can exchange data (tokens etc.,) among themselves

fungible cluster - all the chains essentially represent the same crypto. can have different antara modules enabled, and coins moved from one chain to another, this is the scalability solution";"";"";

this is practically impossible to provide as there are too many jurisdictions and contradicting laws based on locations of issuer and buyer

the only thing we can say is trade of crypto from user to user in a true DEX like atomicDEX is exempt from money transamitter lisense";"";"";
