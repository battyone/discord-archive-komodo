for KMD's dPoW, the block hashes are written to the BTC chain(the chain with the most hash power). so once a block is notarized, even the notary network won't be able to rewrite it
in Dash, we don't know how many of the LLMQ are different operators. so, if the majority of a LLMQ  are controlled by a single entity, they can overwrite a chainlocked block";"";"‚òù (1)";

An attacker would need to have control over 60 percent of all 400 randomly selected master nodes to influence a ChainLock ... ""Which means he would need at least 240 MasterNodes, and even then very good luck. ""And if he can do this despite all (massive) improbabilities, the worst thing he can do is not create a ChainLock, which in the end means the system will fall back to a pure PoW system in the short term.""

It is not possible to give a block a ChainLock if it would otherwise be invalid. ""The network accepts a ChainLock only if the associated block is valid according to all the usual rules. So, even if somehow a ChainLock appeared for a block that is invalid (for example, because it contains a double-donation or transactions have invalid signatures), the entire network would ignore this ChainLock.

there is no need for complete control, i.e., ownership
just need to bribe the owners

in that case the network could be made completely unusable by constantly intoducing forks that have to be manually unforked

the only reason the above isn't happening now is that, the majority of LLMQ want the network to survive i.e., they are honest
if there are other incentives that come into play, the above attack can be done

ex: if someone started a dash blockchain fork that increases the LLMQ's rewards, they are incentivised to stall the current chain constantly to make all the other people to also switch to the new fork";"";"";

"430818734530101248";"KomodoWorld#8282";"04-Sep-19 12:36 AM";"hi everyone 

Dear Komodo community I have very important communications about recent events. Pls take screenshots before this gets censored.

Some people here remember that I've been investing and following Komodo since its old origins in 2014. @hyperDEX @Hollowman9000#3344 @Audo @polycryptoblog you and others I remember from the NXT times. I never took a very active role beside small social and community contributions in general. I have also used a lot of my funds to support ecosystem projects that I like, this is also how I came to support K64.

So the news is that, after a few unsuccessful attempts, Twilight Punkster was able to have me granted fulI clearence for a meeting at the Goldman Sachs office in Milan, including more latitude in what I'm allowed to tell. My visit did nothing but increase my already existing trust in K64 team. 

I can tell you the following facts that I've fully verified:

1. K64 is a registered corporation in the Netherlands

2. The E&Y report values K64 at 1.3 billions

3. The IP is registered and protected worldwide

4. The GSG funding of 78 million euro is real 

5. That funding is just for the first year

6. The release of funding is incremental and dependent on specific milestones to be achieved 

7. K64 has important technological partnerships both active and in the making, one of which with Techmahindra and including blockchain R&D of the highest level.
