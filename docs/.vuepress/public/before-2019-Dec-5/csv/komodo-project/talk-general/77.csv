So the interface/wallet/profile needs to be super easy, easier than opening an account on FB, but where people will get ViisiitCoins for the information they fill in their profiles.  

That was just so you guys can get an idea of what I want to do with Viisiit., and if anyone knows anyone/developers looking for a nice challenge (especially since I myself am not technical / don’t know most jargon, yet) in helping me either; make and/or maintain the assetchain on the Komodo network; make and/or maintain the software / platform of Viisiit., then please can you put us in contact with each other?
