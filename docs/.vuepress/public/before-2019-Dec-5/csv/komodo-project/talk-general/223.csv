https://aws.amazon.com/partners/technology/journey/

Becoming a Registered AWS partner basically just means filling out a form. You might remember QTUM's ""historic partnership"" with AWS announced last October (https://ethereumworldnews.com/qtum-enters-historic-partnership-with-amazon-web-services/) but you can easily see that they are listed as a Registered Partner on the AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/results/?keyword=QTUM)

Becoming a Standard Technology Partner takes a bit more work, submitting some proposals and plans, etc. A few blockchain projects have achieved this level, including Zilliqa (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Zilliqa%20Research%20Pte%20Ltd&id=0010L00001sCcwAQAS)  and TRON (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=TRON%20Foundation&id=0010L00001u5snPQAQ).

Komodo is an Advanced Technology Partner. Getting to this stage requires a lot more vetting, detailed proposals of what the project hopes to accomplish with AWS, and technical validation of the proposed solutions.
