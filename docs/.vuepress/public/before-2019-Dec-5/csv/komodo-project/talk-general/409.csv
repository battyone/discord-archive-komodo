And now you see it, supply chain, ID verification, storage etc.... they are using their own consortium chains and for the publc part ( when benefitting ) they use ETH. If STOs or SME financing become a big thing - they could go for it easily too. They have the tech, the devs, the money and most important - they have already the clients + investors. I can understand now why Andreas M. Antonopoulos is always preaching the 5 must haves for crypto blockchains: open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant. Perhaps i am wrong, but this crash cycle made me finally very picky. Beside that i have still problems to figure out how different POS and governance systems are able to capture network value by using utility tokens. Or what DPOS chains have to do to avoid centralization. I asked this question h TG chats - no answer - perhaps someone here knows it:";"";"";
