If the entire world and its currencies would be revolving around Komodo, that would be a reliable prediction.
However, if the rewards diminish, less coins will be sold on exchanges. If no other factors change, demand would be equal as before. Logic dictates that KMD price will rise.
Although rewards are lowered, it doesn't mean the value of the mining effort is lowered too. As long as the value of the rewards (especially in relation to other chains rewards) remains equal, the hashrate will not change. The cryptomarket will regulate the hashrate on the chain as it does now.";"";"";

I can only point back to a comment I made a while back that you may or may not have seen (I forget when your role changed, so I'm not sure if you saw it or not):
The simplest answer is because we were told it did.
I came to Komodo because the #tradebots channel on slack was a misnomer.
I stayed because I thought I feked up my pool and node and couldn't figure out why it was telling me that my 3 br was 1200+
This was, at that time, a so often asked about thing that it was answered but in a way that was very much like ""How do you not know this?""
That ""added incentive"", or ""bonus"", or whatever we call it in whatever context is most times the only thing that makes mining KMD not a straight loss (compared to mining any one of a dozen other chains) when you have any solid amount of hashpower.
tl:dr:
The code should care because we were told by the creator of the code that the code cares";"";"";
