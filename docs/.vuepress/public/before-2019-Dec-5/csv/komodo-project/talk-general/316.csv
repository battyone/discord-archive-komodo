If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama";"";"";
