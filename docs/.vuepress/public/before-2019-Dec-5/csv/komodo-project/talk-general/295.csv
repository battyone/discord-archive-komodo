(you used the RR profile pic before). Second, you are not able to give us any proof you are from IBM., which should be so easy if it was true. So no need to cry here or on twitter.

So for now best is to not speak about that anymore but rather apologize, focus on the tech-side of things and proofing your claims. I am sure you understand that its hard for us to trust you after:

a) you have used someone else profile pictures, name and even bio on all of your social media profiles - DONT you dare to compare this to me using a penguin or someone else using a bear profile pic. Yes they do exist as well - but dont have a unique socialID and name. so that move was 1) illegal and 2) xtremly unethical. Just for the protocol: you have pretended to be Elke Schroth: https://www.bellevuehill.ch/%C3%BCber-mich/ !!! Dont try to turn it now - thats the wrong way. Apologize and hope to not meet ban-hammer or pwny-pengiun.
 
b) even after we revealed this you kept claiming to have that name and you didn't  bother to change the stolen biography! 

c) and your post above ref. Ricardian contract is just :troll_hmm:
