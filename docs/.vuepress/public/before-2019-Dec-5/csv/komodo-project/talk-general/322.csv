I wish you all positive mental health and a laser like focus to fix the issue.  Do not get concerned with self doubt or fear.  These things happen and it's how they are dealt with that determine the outcomes.   Remember to take breaks for yourself when you can... without energy and rest, the mind can't focus. 

If you're a person of science, remember, Earth was once hit by a planteoid so large, that the rock ceased to exist.... until it fixed the problem and became the amazing thing it is today.
If you're a person of religion, remember, everything happens for a reason.

Battles and challenges provide us with the wealth of knowledge and learning opportunities we can't test for.
