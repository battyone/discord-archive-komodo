1. import agama seed in chameleon pay or magnum wallet
2. download verus agama and create new seed - get address
3. send funds from bad agama to new safe address via chameleon or magnum

I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.";"";"💯 (1)";
