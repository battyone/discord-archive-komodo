And congratulations to winners!

Meantime if your wallet is in the richlist and you assume yourself winner, but for whatever reason none of the explorers (e.g. komodod.com ) or official github repo have no your wallet published - please - message me ASAP (!) so we can check why.

Later I will contact probably all winners for other details. And winners will be announced officially in a few days.

Automation helps, a lot, but only to some extent. It'll be a deliusional life to rely solely on automation setup. Please don't rely on your automation skills. You'll get hit and will have hard time recovering.
Chose your Vendor of hosting server wisely, if you don't want to get in to the hassle of changing the server/IPv4 later on, which can in turn again hit your notarisation counts, which is THE MOST important thing for any Notary Node.
It is always best to chose to have your OWN HARDWARE. You can own it, mod it, improve it, with much cheaper expsenses as compare to hosting or cloud servers, which are shiny, but not always what they represent. Even with the low grade server of your own, you might do overperform as per your expectations than what you think you can do with hosted or a cloud server.
You will have to spend your nights and days defending the network along with devs. Be present, over the clock, anytime. Your first and utmost priority is the Notary Nodes Notifications and Alerts, can covey this message to your partner ahead of time, so they don't mind you unavailable sometimes. Hope they understand your reasons.
