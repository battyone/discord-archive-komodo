1. Switch back to yearly (or lesser) claiming in order to avoid that in a security breach many users are in danger. I am an example of a person that only had to be secured because I had to claim.
Of course I unterstand the incentive to have active users, but this also opposes risk as we have seen.
2. Another option is to make ot possible to claim from another address. Some kind of delegating, so if Address A with coins delegates the claim right to B, B can claim but A always gets the funds. In that case we would not have to log into the account withs funds monthly.
3. Create a minimal wallet with as less dependencies as posssible that get's security reviewed and that does not need to get online. That wallet could create an offline transaction to claim and does not need to get updated as often.
Maybe these suggestions can help @komodoteam @jl777c";"";"";
