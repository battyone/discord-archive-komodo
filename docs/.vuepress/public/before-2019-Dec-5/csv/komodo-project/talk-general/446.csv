I'm quite surprised and humbled by the bounty.

Thanks to the support that's been given I've had the opportunity to speak with many people recently, some in the top of their field. People who I'd never have expected to meet.  This is because of you, and the world you are creating from here.  I can do this because I know that you are standing beside me, and many of you have been here before.

You may not realize it but you have taken a totally average person, an anybody, and through your patience, guidance and encouragement have given that person the power and the tools to effect real change in this world.    

This is the promise of crypto that I read of.  I'm seeing now that it is more than a promise.  It is something real for all of us, just sitting there, waiting to be grabbed hold of and put into practice. 

The people who were named this month are some of the many examples of this. You have my great respect.

Any of us can contribute in our own way.  And the more I see of other projects, the more it becomes clearer that Komodo is something very worth contributing to.

Thank you to everyone for being here and doing your part towards creating a better future.
