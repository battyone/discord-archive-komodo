https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

I will run the refund processor daily for a while, so if you dont get your tx done before i start the refund processor, you will need to wait another day. Also if you have a larger amount, we need to wait a bit more time to make sure there are no disputes. and if your funds were not swept, but stolen, you need to wait and additional week.

it does take a long time to run the refund processor as i didnt code it for efficiency. i will process progressively larger and larger amounts during the week and will post the most recent cutoff value. that way you dont have to keep asking when your refund will be processed. until you send in your dust tx from old address to new address and i process refunds bigger than your refund, your refund wont be processed.";"";"👍 (4)";

1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done.";"";"";
