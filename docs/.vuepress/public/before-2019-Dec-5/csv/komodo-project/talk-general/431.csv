There would be no reason not to pay suppliers at the risk of public fallout and fuel to the already raging fire. So if they dont have money yet and 'owe' money to suppliers and partners, they cant cancel contracts or just refuse to pay. The next point is the previous company was bankrupt 4 years ago. Investors wont touch that. Also 70% of all VC funding is based on team. VCs wont let CEOs and founders change during the funding round. This is investment 101. VCs sign founders to golden handcuffs. Also no VC would stand by and let what is unfolding happen. They would protect their investment. Simple. The last point is that E&Y cant pass an audit if there is outstanding invoices to suppliers etc. These must all be settled. This is a safe bet. $1.8 or $1800";"";"👍 (2),🤔 (1),👎 (1),👈 (1),👉 (1),troll_hmm (1)";
