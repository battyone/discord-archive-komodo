using a dedicated device, synced full node of that cryptocurrency which you have tokens of and which you value the most, compiled from source code, only command line and without any user interface, and only running this command line daemon on that machine and no use of any other software or service on that machine except this dedicated use. running it over tor + firewall setup, you can do simple commands for komodo like ""sendtoaddress"" to send the funds from your own address to your own address holding the funds, every month, to accrue and get rewards.";"";"";

That depends on the topic and context
Not all ""drama"" is bad and not all prolonged discussion about differing sides of a topic is ""drama""
