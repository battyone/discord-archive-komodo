In any case I didnt even start BTCD but had joined after the coin was launched";"";"";

Also, when a coin will be updating their source code, it is a good thing that the two dev teams are coordinating to make sure things go smoothly. if that is called centralization, it seems it is unavoidable. We do have to charge a nominal fee to cover expenses, but we dont require anybody to pay for the BTC txfees, nor for a coin to change their emission schedule to payout a percentage, nor do we spam the BTC chain 500x with the same data with something that likely cant differentiate from the attacker chain vs. the real chain. and of course no coin actually uses this now, so all the BTC spam is just $1.5 mil per month being wasted";"";"";

We do know that aggregating data from random nodes on the internet wont create any trustless data. that just doesnt work as the attacker can just buy the winning chain, if chains actually used the PoP data, it would help the attacker double spend. so they have many problems left to solve. 

dPoW has already solved all this, it is effective, cost efficient, open source. It just makes me sad that people can post blatant lies about our tech";"";"";

2. agreed and we have projects in the works to solve this
3. the pegs CC will utilize KMD as backing to create stablecoins, but in general I prefer to just expand the ecosystem and KMD benefits indirectly. Artificially constraining supply, is pretty artificial and charging fees in KMD just because we can will slow down adoption.
4. the design of CC is such that each one creates its own set of rpc calls, so just by calling various rpc calls (in any language) you can create a dapp, this is much easier than even writing interpreted smart contracts
5. LN could work with blockchain protocol that doesnt have txid malleability, but they made it also require segwit. KMD will never have segwit. That being said channels CC solves the latency issue for payments and creates a hubless (no centralization) payment channels
6. as you say we are working with projects to integrate in all directions, gaming included
7. last time i checked, we have no way to force the community to do anything, but of course any community help is appreciated

We use blockchains and have to implement some kind of smart contracts service based on multisig to handle our business logic in a decentralized manner when used blockchain itself has RPC API. 
So it is really mind-blowing design of RPC if it will handle all possible cases. Other possible interpretation is that API is designed to make possible integration of decentralized services which will emulate some kind of smart contracts. Then it is possible to design service templates to handle flexible business logic using RPC by the community developers.";"";"";
