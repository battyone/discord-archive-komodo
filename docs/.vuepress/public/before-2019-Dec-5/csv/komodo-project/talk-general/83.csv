It was extremely well written, the best whitepaper i've ever read imo. just wanted a little bit of clarification on the frequency of notary nodes winning blocks using the easy difficulty.  Is it basically one specific notary node will mine 1 block (and be rewarded 3KMD) out of every 64 KMD blocks, with the exception of the 2k block free-for-all period?";"";"";

own cycle. At the start of the cycle the notary node holds the “easy difficulty” ability until it mines one
“easy” block. Then the Iguana Core code removes the ability for the next sixty-four blocks. After the
sixty-four-block period passes, the notary node can once again attempt to capture a block on “easy
difficulty.”
Therefore, while everyone else on the network mines at an adjustable level of difficulty according to the
normal PoW consensus mechanism (which keeps the overall speed of the Komodo network stable) the
notary nodes have a chance to step outside the normal rules. For every sixty-five-block period on the
Komodo blockchain11, the odds that a block will be mined by a notary node, as opposed to a normal
miner, are essentially 3:1.";"";"";
