from what i can tell, the vast majority fall into the above category. i will use the blockchain to prove that the repayment has been made. after this first phase of repayments, the number of claimants will be much reduced, but there will still be a lot of KMD left to payout. the second phase will deal with swept funds that are big, but are uncontested. so make sure to fill out your form ASAP.

the third phase will deal with funds that were stolen. at that point all that will be left are the disputed addresses, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

the sooner we can complete the refund process the better, so my goal is to complete all phases other than dispute resolutions by the end of this month, but with vast majority of cases before june 15th. thank you for your patience.";"";"üí™ (7),üëç (12),üëå (3),yassinheart (6),Komodo (7)";
