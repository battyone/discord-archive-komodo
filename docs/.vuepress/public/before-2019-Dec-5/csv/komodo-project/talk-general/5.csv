Maybe a bot could log in and keep a record of the conversations from here to there.  For free, they give this service and it's all encrypted so that even the host doesn't know what's being said.  As a friend of Komodo and a http://Keybase.io user I'd be happy to start the chat groups and later add in other administrators.  However I'm not familiar with how to echo traffic from here into there.  Just as a user who occassionally logs in to the chat here, there isn't any scroll back feature that goes back months.   

But I will say this about Keybase.  If you create a user or team name on there.... don't delete it.  I wanted to create  a team for RemedyCoin but instead I created a username.  There wasn't an upgrade path so I thought I could delete my user account, use another one and create a team.  But no, usernames and teams cannot be restored, converted and if a name ever existed and was deleted, it cannot be brought back.  So I had to settle for remedycoinCom  as a team name.  

They also have Git archive services for teams that offers pgp signing of patches.";"";"";

in NNs, there is the ""chance"" aspect, but then once you are ""the chosen one"" (and there are more than one ""chosen one"" per round) you will not be ""the chosen one"" until others have had a chance to be ""the chosen one"" for a number of rounds....and then the cycle again goes to a random state with 60+ possibilities.";"";"";

""IOTA, Komodo Platform and more coming to Bitpanda"" (3 minute read on Medium).

1 - This means a new alternative to coinbase and $BTC transfers to a $KMD $MIOT listed exchange! 
2 - It means $KMD and $MIOTA tokens finally have a direct fiat pair on Bitpanda! 
3 - Trading starts on June 12th.

I was just wondering why you can't consider every 5 block, there is 1 block with easy diff (so for NN). For the blocks with easy diff, you can well follow the ""round robin"" rule. 

I see 2 advantages : 

1 - miners can play with the 2 sequences, they must always be on KMD.

2 - it avoids the generation of orphan blocks (currently it happens when transitions ""NN <-> free for all"" occur.";"";"";
