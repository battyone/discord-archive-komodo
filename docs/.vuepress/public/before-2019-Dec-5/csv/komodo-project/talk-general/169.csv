Lightning will enable an economic reason to migrate away from corporations in the first place. I look forward to an entirely peer to peer transactional world. Corporations / governments can try to regulate it, but it can't. People will use dApps because they will be cheaper than going through corps. If corps want to limit where you can send your money, they will simply lose customers, they will lose any economic advantage they have as incumbents. The fact is, KYC can be done in a trustless manner, using zero knowledge proofs, etc. KYC should not be a hang up if all of this technology gets built.";"";"";

It would be nice to talk about dpow here
However, dpow requires a hardfork to reverse the blockchain at prior checkpoint level. Im not a dpow expert,if sm knows about dpow it would be nice to talk
Immutability is our priority
a.s.Today at 2:32 AM
Just answered there, that if there is an interest in our community, we will try to get both side together for further discussions
phyroToday at 2:34 AM
We wont be reverting
marrychToday at 2:35 AM
@phyro you mean that we don't want to be reverting or that dpow wont be reverting?
phyroToday at 2:37 AM
we won't be reverting the chain for any reason
marrychToday at 2:38 AM
So they can just explain us how dpow works,and if there is a possibility not to revert
