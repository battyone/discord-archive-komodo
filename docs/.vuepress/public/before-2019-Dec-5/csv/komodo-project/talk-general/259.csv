Mainly new coin and DPoW inquires, but some whitelabel requests as well.    Most needs can be fulfilled ,  more intensive projects are on the sideline until we get our own things out there. Information flows between the required parties with as little hops along the way.  Always need more service providers on board ,  currently documentation is being written to aid people in that.    Functionality added typically upon request or whatever the devs feel they want to implement . Areas we need to focus on are dumbing down our language as much as possible,  creating free blockchain based applications.  Coordinate simple marketing efforts with the community";"";"";
