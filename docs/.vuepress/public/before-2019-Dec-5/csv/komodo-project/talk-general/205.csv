CryptoBridge is now able to list KMD asset chains.

Ransomware, ‚ÄúCryptojacking,‚Äù and
‚Äú51% Attacks‚Äù
Along with the theft of crypto-assets, the
authors have observed multiple types of
cyber-attacks involving the blockchain
and crypto-assets including ransomware,
‚Äúcryptojacking,‚Äù and 51% attacks.
A long-standing security issue, ransomware
infects and encrypts a target system,
preventing its usage until a ransom,
typically paid in a cryptocurrency like
bitcoin, is paid by the victim.
A stealthier security risk is ""cryptojacking"" or deploying mining software
that silently utilizes a company‚Äôs system
processing power in the background, often
unbeknownst to the user.
A 51% attack occurs when a miner or group
of miners is able to amass a majority of
a blockchain‚Äôs hashing power, thereby
allowing the perpetrator to rearrange
transactions and ‚Äúdouble spend‚Äù coins.
Once a theoretical concept, this type of
attack has led to the theft of crypto-assets.";"";"";
