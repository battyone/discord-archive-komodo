The number of notarizations per block doesn't matter because if you were to compromise the security of the block itself (a 51% on Bitcoin, which we agree isn't likely) then it doesn't matter how many notarizations were included in that block, it's gone.

What you are suggesting is sending the same transaction 30 times on Bitcoin, to be included in the exact same block, somehow makes that transaction more secure than a single transaction included in that block. 

The common denominator here is ""included in a block"" the number of transactions included in that block doesn't matter, it's the block that is secured and therefore the individual transactions in it.``` ^^ read again. More TXs per block does not make it more secure. 

If PoP miners had came to consensus on what the hash actually is, and then sent a single tx to Bitcoin notarizing that hash, you'd have a better system.";"";"üíØ (3)";
