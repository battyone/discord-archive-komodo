From those of us in the crypto community that have been here a while....Komodo shined brightly under immense pressure. JL777 (James) stayed up 30 hours straight until he had saved as much Komodo as possible. You one the other hand, merely being late for dinner, melted down into irrational diatribe. When you calm down and become reasonable you might be able to see the flip side and how amazing of a job Komodo Team did in response and under a rush of immense pressure. Komodo acted like Fire Fighters running into a burning building to save the children, while you broke down into a ball of hysterical babble curled up in the fetal position...and then ran to Youtube to sensationalize the drama and grow your Patreon revenue because the burning building made you late for dinner.

Give it some love.";"";"💪 (4)";
