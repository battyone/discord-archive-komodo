Few months ago, a virus was injected in few yiimp pools. The BTC wallet was emptied by hacker.
Entry points were identified and fixed into yiimp but we wanted to add a kind of ""condom"" within bitcoin wallet code.
With existing options, some pools disabled broadcasting of tx and broadcast manually.
I performed few changes into bitcoin code (forbid to withdraw more than 1% of total balance with sendmany and sendtoaddress, forbid dumpprivkey and so on). Changes were tested successfully but with hardcoded values into sendmany and sendmoney
I tried to make it more clean (either use arguments at compilation OR use the coin.conf file) but my code doesn't work. I asked help to some bitcoin devs that I'm in contact with but they didn't help so much. They suggest to use a proxy in front of the coin node but it will reduce perfs and I'm not fan to use additional software
As my pool doesn't have bitcoin and only altcoins, I'm interested to have such a feature into komodo and other altcoins
I discussed it briefly with @metaphilibert he suggested to me to talk about it in public

""imo Bitcoin people have the most incentive and will power to effect the change that ripples out. potentially the most leverage due to sound money and decentralization. but if the leaders, who should know better, ignore the problems in the field, tail risks are increased. to conclude, the best marketing is to be aligned with the truth and selling to those who it resonates with. that means setting expectations properly and battling those who oversell and underdeliver for a quick buck.""";"";"";
