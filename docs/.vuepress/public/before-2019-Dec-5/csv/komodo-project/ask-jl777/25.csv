> why would they want to be controlling notary nodes? the idea is to not have to worry about such things
Caltech, Medici, and Alexandria projects all expressed deep concern about not having any option to allow users to participate in the security of the network. We don't want to ""not worry about the security"", we want to build applications in which our users can participate in the security of the network the same day that they learn about the network. In fact, in all of those projects, users are encouraged and rewarded for participating in the security of the network at the protocol level.

> they wanted duke to basically work for free
> they only had $500 
The offer was $500 in BTC upfront plus any amount of FLO you felt reasonable after the job is complete. I was asking for an hour a week in a conference call to help review our code and answer questions. I think our offer was fair, and actually better in terms of dollars per hour than a fulltime engagement where you are coding for months and responsible for delivering the entire completed software.";"";"";

Notary nodes are elected delegates,  which have a mining privilege in the Komodo chain ,simply handing over a notary node is the equivalent of paying you to secure to your chain.  If you want control of a Notary node your community can gather votes to be elected as one.   What you are paying for with DPoW integration not only making FLO compatible but the running of FLO nodes on all Notary servers, a necessary audit to confirm that running your nodes isn't going to compromise our setups.  500$ doesn't come close to the costs of integration and while yes you offered FLO which I'm sure could be taken in part,  the truth is much would have to hit the market to recover costs which would not be beneficial for FLOs price.   TLDR :  notaries secure through sending tx in Komodo chain of FLO blockhashes to prevent private mined 51% attacks and mitigate other attacks controlling one node of 64 does nothing in that process and the cost of integration is much more than offered even at modest IT rates";"";"💯 (1)";

I'm also interested in making use of dPOW security and in particiating as a NN.
As mentioned, surely there are many others out there among all of the projects that would like the same.  And yet there are only 30 (+3?) NN positions available at the next election.  
In my case, for practical reasons, I view these as 2 separate matters.
If I were to consider them as one in the same I would need to seriously consider the advice from jl777 above and create my own network notarizing to BTC. Not a realistic possibility for me at the moment.
The #notarynode channel is open to all to participate in.  Of course, that's not actually sending transactions to BTC (who does that is rightly decided by the Komodo community).  It can be a form of active participation by those who choose to use it as such though.
This discussion is useful for me to clarify the best course of action for the near future.
Hopefully further discussion generates other ideas that I can use :)
