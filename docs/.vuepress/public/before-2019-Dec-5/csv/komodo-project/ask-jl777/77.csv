Komodo is now focusing on attracting users to build blockchain on top of Komodo blockchain.. This value proposition needs lot of resource and community development..
Ethereum is already way ahead in Dapp market and Cosmos and polkadot's offering is better in terms of ""build your own blockchain"" in comparison to Komodo (Don't want to offend anyone,  this is my research) 

So let's forget about Dapp market.. and think of ""Build your own blockchain"" usecase.. Both cosmos and Polkadot are building frameworks so others can build a blockchain using their framework but real business model is ""security as a service"" even for Polkadot and cosmos.. Cosmos hub plans to provide security as a service in the future and for polkadot you need to deposit dots to secure a parachain (blockchain build on polkadot).. Both these protocols deploy some version of PoS.

Now Let's talk about Komodo.. Komodo can champion ""Security as a service"" for PoW blockchains ...or even further this development and become a general purpose  with decentralise  ""security-as-a-service"" usecase. Now comes the cream,. Go with this same value position to enterprise which are using hyperledger or any other consortium blockchain (may be extra privacy feature)..   

I think this is a better and niche usecase, and also good for KMD token economics.";"";"";
