"390385766271942667";"acidbird#7266";"21-Jul-19 10:00 AM";"Well, it depends, there are exchanges which do charge, others have rules for listing (for ex. liquidity pools, tokens for trading competitions, etc.). and donâ€™t charge. The same goes to dividends. With all these new approaches i still canâ€™t get the benefit of holding KMD and it is possible future value, it is more like a brand cost which depends on overall visibility of the ecosystem. 5,1% is a good thing but it doesnâ€™t help if the token has no value or its value depends on some indirect things. Hopefully we will see more kmd trading activity with dex launch but really i donâ€™t see key or main value proposition here for KMD or still missing smth.";"";"";
