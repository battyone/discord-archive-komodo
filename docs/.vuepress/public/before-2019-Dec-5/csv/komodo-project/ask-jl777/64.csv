In your chicken and egg post [1] are you saying that at chain setup within the 100blocks to create the early tx. Then restart setting -ac_earlytxid when completed (within the 100 blocks)?

Billing themselves as the ‚Äúplatform of platforms‚Äù, developers were restricted to using the Komodo platform only. This could be very limiting as it is an enforcement of a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach, which is a barrier to potential innovation. By this time, Komodo had also begun utilizing an (unrecognized) atomic swap process on its own DEX, Barterdex, but they use a partially centralized order matching system for buy and sell orders that is similar to Waves and also feature centralized Electrum servers in the trading process itself which ultimately increases risk and reduces decentralization. Since Bartedex was not built on a protocol geared specifically towards decentralized exchange and the Komodo system requires nodes to back up the Komodo Blockchain every 10 minutes into the KMD chain and then into the BTC chain, this ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù system may cause scaling issues in the future as this process may cause blockchain bloat due to the limitations of the BTC block, which is also about 10 minutes or 1MB per block.""";"";"üí© (4),ü§¢ (2)";
