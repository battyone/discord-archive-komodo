I haven't tried it yet a but I also haven't seen a screenshot of AtomicDEX that contains 
an optional reporting service as in CEX's (deposit, transactions/trade history, withdrawals), I hope it has this option.
If it doesn’t, I'm afraid that I won't be using it and have the feeling that many others would do the same,
because for some of us that go the legal route when we make a withdrawal to fiat  
and need to prove the source of our funds to government, IRS and banks it's going to be a nightmare.";"";"";

I can't check this with `komodo-cli`: ```komodo-cli getinfo
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
