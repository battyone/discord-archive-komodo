```The problem is three-fold:

1.¬†Namecoin wasn't easy enough to use. The wallet still sucks, and there were no resolvers or good tutorials until I got involved. And that was three years after Namecoin existed. If they'd had a great wallet, a good resolver, and good tutorials from day one, Dot-Bit domains could likely be universal by now.

2.¬†Some of the Namecoin developers kind of lost track of the plot at some point. Once they were all broke (and isn't that maybe the market sending signals?) some of the team tried to partner Namecoin with Google and even ICANN. That makes no sense. That's making a technology to circumvent governments and then handing it over to governments.

3.¬†Most people don't care. Despite censorship of the Web around the world, and the threat of more impending Web censorship in the US, most people would rather spend hours forwarding and discussing horror stories of censorship and impending doom than actually spending an hour making their own domain censorship-proof by setting up a Dot-Bit mirror URL and then promoting it.

The biggest flaw is the clunky wallet that takes ten minutes to open. The other biggest flaw is that the near-zero expense of registering domains encouraged domain squatting

Also, Dot-Bit is actually vulnerable to a hostile takeover from ICANN.¬†```

```Basically [my idea is] customizable HOSTS.txt files, with a resolver built off the code of MeowBit, and a way for people with no computer skills to easily customize lists and share them via BitTorrent (without even needing to know what a HOSTS.txt file or BitTorrent is). Making it easy to compete to make and share the best lists would drive adoption.```";"";"";
