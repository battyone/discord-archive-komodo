The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them.

It's just a shower thought, perhaps suitble for a community discussion, cheers ----- 

Asking the real questions here...
● How can an OTC trade of arbitrary size take place, in a
decentralized manner, w/o any escrows?
● How can bids/asks be placed/taken with a *chosen*
party, w/o an intermediate, and risk-free?
● How can this be realised with Komodo’s existing tech
i.e. within Komodo ecosystem?

Komodo’s OTC Dex

 OTX: an OTC Dex solution by Komodo

for: miners, shallow and deep pockets, and anybody seeking to do quick
business w/o going via exchanges with imposed (low) limits

 It would work in a similar way the BarteDEX does with
atomic swaps, but
● Instead of waiting for orders to get filled in the usual way through order matching, an immediate trade on agreed upon price can take place, with tx-fees e.g. shared equally between the parties, or optional buyer/seller bears all fees
● Each party has permanent account (name) linked to, perhaps, reputation or scoring mechanism with stated coins willing to do business in (KMD,ARRR,BTC,etc)
● TX fees are perhaps only in KMD or BTC
● Some simple chat function per transaction/trade, with downloadable/archiving function, available only to involved parties per tx, and/or sort of trade summary as with atomic swaps
● Log in, check out currents offers on the board, sort by coin, contact the buyer/seller and do business
● Coin not found? Place an offer or a request...
● If trade agreed upon > initiate automated trustless exchange of funds";"";"";
