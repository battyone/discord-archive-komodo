```The Satoshi v0.5.3 protocol views those P2SH addresses as scripts without any public key (i.e. no signature required to spend them), so they can be spent by anyone. Essentially SegWit transactions as interpreted by the Satoshi protocol, before Core unilaterally decided to softfork the protocol, to be transactions sent to some script that has no protection against anyone spending them....

Thus when the Satoshi v0.5.3 miners decide to force Core to fork-off, they will start spending those to themselves when they win a block and the Core miners will fork-off and the Satoshi miners will not fork off.....

Everyone who has their BTC stored in addresses that begin with¬†1¬†will receive a free airdrop of Core tokens when Core is forced to fuck-off (ahem I mean fork-off, lol), in addition to their Satoshi BTC tokens. So then they can sell those Core shitcoins to buy moar real Satoshi BTC. Those who ignorantly hodl their ‚ÄúBTC‚Äù in addresses that begin with¬†3will have their Satoshi protocol BTC taken by the miners and they will only keep their soon-to-be-worthless Core shitcoins.```";"";"";

I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD.

Piratechain developing own wallets, Verus developing own wallets, K64 developing own wallets, RFOX.... wouldn't it be easier if example! Chainzilla (and Agama) developing all KMD and assets wallets? More more resources for other developments. Another side, more wallets=more possibility good and bad sides.";"";"";
