I think it would be a good test to make a new chain with same clusterid and see if this unauthorized chain can do the burn protocol with the official cluster chains. If so, it is a bug and we will fix it";"";"";

For example, an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional branching (e.g., ""if"" and ""goto"" statements, or a ""branch if zero"" instruction; see one instruction set computer) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items).
