We would like your insight as we are working on promoting real life use case for KSB (stable coin), we would like to find or encourage the use of KSB as a transactional medium (medium of exchange & unit of account) and wonder if you would be aware of projects related to the Komodo Platform, type decentralize market place, merchant or service providers that could use  a stable coin feature. @SHossain said that you would probably be the best person to answer this question. Cheers";"";"";

is is just way too early to expect to see this. yes, the lack of liquidity can be/ is an issue for some people, but the intrinsic value of SUPERNET does not increase with more back-and-forth trading of the SUPERNET asset, but with the adoption of the underlying projects that SUPERNET own.

this reminds me of a saying of Warren Buffett: ""I try to invest in such companies that even when the markets will be turned off for 10 years, i will still be confident that my investments are doing just fine"" more liquidity is always good, but there is just too much emphasis on short term speculation.
