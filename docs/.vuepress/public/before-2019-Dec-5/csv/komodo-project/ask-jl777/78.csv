There is a mechanism in play that accomplishes the same goals, lack of reward claiming , with only about 50% claiming their rewards about 12k coins per day never come into existence. Re: 3rd party chains as a focus.    Having experience with soliciting coins for the service,  most arenâ€™t financially or technically in the position to receive it .  Especially if it requires a code audit.  Then there is the chains it would require extensive work to DPoW such as ethereum forks.  Which due to limited number of them itâ€™s not worth devoting efforts to this time.  Most DPoW demand will come from Kmd created chains as it doesnâ€™t require a code audit which costs tens of thousands and takes away from manpower.

7000 kmd will get 20 years of notarizations.
