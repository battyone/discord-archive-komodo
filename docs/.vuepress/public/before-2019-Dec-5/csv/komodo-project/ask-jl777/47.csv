1 - the sender wallet ballance was jumping up  and down it goes 0 then 2min later to 1000 then 0 then 500 and eventually it went to 0

A company my company works with uses a system called LPS for supply chain management of car parts and to make sure each part individually goes through all the processes by making a log of when it goes from station to station with an attatched anotator  of whether the part passed or failed the previous process based on parameter window limits. A blockchain is literally keymade for this type of part of tracking but would decentralized nodes holding the database fair better than a Centralized super computer server managing this kind of push/pull query. Honestly on second thought it definitely has to be better, because of the local data holding over a Centralized server having to do pushes and pulls whereas a blockchain only has pushes.";"";"";

This tech tuesday has a supply chain scenario.   have a look at the json data structure, and see if something similar will fit in your car part scenario.   if it's just checking somethiing off, it's changing the state of some json object maybe.   each tx to blockchain just adjusts state.   just becomes a GUI integration with object's state changes i guess...
