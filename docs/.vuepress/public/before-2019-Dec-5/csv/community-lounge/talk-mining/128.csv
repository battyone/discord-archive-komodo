I have a solution, YOU HEARD  THIS IDEA HERE FIRST FROM ME

`miningfool.com`

 i am working on a great new feature.

soon you will be able to download an excel or spreadsheet file that has a history of all your payouts ... (PURPOSELY BUILT TO MAKE TAXES EASY)

For a year you choose..... i support 7 years of data in the past...

you will be able to download a spreadsheet with your payout history for that entire year by month by day.. payouts will be rolled up for each day.. just the way the tax man likes them...

for each day of there year where you had atleast one payout,  you will have the Coin Name, Coin Amount, US Dollar Amount, DATE
in a nice PERFECT spreadsheet FOR TAX PURPOSES

obviously the link to download will be on your miner page... so its a a spreadsheet report PER address..

but this will make doing taxes SUPER EASY

soon this feature will be available...

You can use https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo or https://github.com/jl777/komodo . For branch, we suggest to use `master` branch for pools. However, if you know what you are doing, you can also use `beta` branch. As soon as you finish updating, please ping us here with your pool name. If you need help please ask here. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @webworker01 @NutellaLicka @mrlynch are experienced pool operator and are ready to help you.

Update process is simple. You can issue the following commands to compile updated `komodod` (change branch name if needed). These commands to be used as general guidance and to keep compile issues at minimum level. If you want to update using your own method, please go ahead.
```
cd ~/komodo
git reset --hard
make clean
git checkout master
git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
Once you finish updating, `getinfo` call should display `""KMDversion: 0.4.0a"",`

Note: This is a hardforking update to include next Season 3 Notary Node keys and must be carried out before 15th July. Thank you very much for your co-operation.";"";"Komodo (3),💯 (1)";
