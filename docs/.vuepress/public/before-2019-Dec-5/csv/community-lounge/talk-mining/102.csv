Need 10 AWG 3 wire .  30A double pole breaker and outlet and PDU with appropriate plug.   The main benefits of running at higher voltage is that you can get more miners in per circuit ( I=V/R). and efficiency increase,  Current generates heat ( W=I ^2*R)  , conductors like copper increase their resistance based on heat resulting in less efficiency.";"";"";
