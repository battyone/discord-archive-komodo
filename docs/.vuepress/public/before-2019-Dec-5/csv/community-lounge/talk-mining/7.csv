I think you may have it backwards. ASICS were made to mine the Equihash algo, it was NOT KMD that was built to support ASICS. 
KMD did not change to allow or disallow asics. I am not pro or contra asics, I have a bit of both GPU's and Asics, they are simply tools for different jobs.  
I realize that can be taken as semantics, but my main point is that KMD is NOT made for miners, GPU or otherwise. 

The way I understood jl's vision form the start, KMD is a utility coin, it's value comes from being used by various parts of the ecosystem, and mining is meant to be a very small part of that. That is one of the reasons for the dPOW and 75% of the blocks mined by notaries. Miners are expected to have much less say in KMD than for example companies that are/will be  building on top of it. (see the 'Ecosystem' list on the sidebar). Right now that ecosystem is only just starting, but I for one am happy that it is finally taking off.";"";"";

KMD is on Equihash, Equihash was built for the very purpose of remaining ASIC resistant. Here's a little brush up from the Wikipedia. ""Equihash was introduced at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego. The cryptocurrency ZCash integrated Equihash in April 2016, for reasons such as security, privacy, and ASIC miner resistance. Bitcoin Magazine notes, ""According to the CryptoLUX scientists, the algorithm permits avoiding centralization of the mining process in the hands of a few first-class miners with specialized mining hardware, thus contributing to the ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of digital currencies based on Equihash.""[3]"". You'll note the part where it specifically states that the purpose of Equihash was to avoid centralization in the mining process to t hose with specialized hardware.  You'll also note the following from the same Wikipedia article ""Equihash is now considered broken in the sense of purpose. The manufacturer Bitmain has succeeded in optimizing the processing of the algorithm with an ASIC. This makes the use of graphics cards too expensive.[4]"".";"";"";
"228675911396884481";"Beetcoin#9049";"28-Jun-18 10:40 AM";"You'll also note that KMD uses a paragraph citing Satoshi's vision, whom you'll remember coined the phrase 1 cpu 1 vote. KMD is not Zcash, and certainly have the ability to fork away from asics without damaging their own eco system, but they have not. Instead, the decision is to make no decision. Sitting on your hands is not something Satoshi would have done, certainly isn't something KMD should be doing, and it really draws attention to the fact that a deal might have struck under the table with Bitmain NOT to fork the coin so they can sell their asics, or, that the team themselves own asics and for the sake of their own greed, do not wish to fork. That answer, honestly, would be a much more appreciated answer than ""mining only accounts for 25% of the network, it wont' matter, we'll do nothing"", which is a huge middle finger to the miners.";"";"";

The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few - this statement should be imprinted on everyone‚Äôs head who runs a coin and bends over for ASICS.
What they will find out tho, is by not forking they lose their community which helped build the coin, and when they need help or support and look around there will be an empty space.";"";"";
