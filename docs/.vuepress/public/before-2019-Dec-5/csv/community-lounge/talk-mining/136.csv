"352488299077566475";"zawy#5864";"01-Aug-19 09:26 PM";"I've been discussing with @jl777c how to do this.  Quick drops like this after hash attacks without symmetrical ability to increase causes too many coins to be issued, if the large miner wants to come back as soon as it is low again. BCH's asymmetrical EDA was a famously bad example and we're trying to do something 10,000x more extreme.   If you try to make it symmetrical with fast rises when the attacks begin, you end up in persistant wild oscillations as as the big miner comes and goes.   However this is an extreme situation where coins get stuck, so it's hard to imagine it being worse.   To test the theory this will issue too many coins, model for a 1000x miner to start mining if difficulty drops < 5x the  basiline miners' hashrate, and then stops when difficulty reaches 100x";"";"";
