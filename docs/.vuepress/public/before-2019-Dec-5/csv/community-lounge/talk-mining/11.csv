Yes that's one way to get involved, but if it's not profitable, its not profitable... face it. No need to rage out and dump it. Being non profitable doesn't make it a bad coin or have bad features. Smart miners mine profitable coins, sell them, and buy the coins they really want. 

I truly do agree with you that we don't wanna just upset people and lose awhole bunch of people. But i really see you making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. You even agree'd you are still hodling. So you're one of the smart one's, even if you do have to switch your rigs to something more profitable. 

I really don't think there is anything wrong with ASIC mining, its more efficient and it doesn't hurt our network.  The GPU miners can mine profitably elsewhere and continue supporting KMD by BUYING and not dumping for costs. or good luck.";"";"";

As a HODLer, I want to support the coin because I believe in the tech. But if you unnecessarily alienate and marginalize supporters, you start working against your own best interests. And if a decision like that is made in 30 seconds with no real dispute like the one I've brought here, that's very alarming. Then you end up with people in my inbox, seeing me sispute some points for apparently the first time ever, who are raging upset with KMD for the decision, and want to see it fail. That's not healthy for the coin or the community, even if its an extremely acute minority of the community. I know this might sound like heresy, but not all decisions can be tech first, community last like this one has been.";"";"";
