This pool provides easy to switch KMD & Pirate mining(just change the port), with more KMD assetchains being added soon!
Please consider us if you'd like a low latency connection(compared to pools hosted in NA or EU). We offer a 1% fee and quick payouts (~3mins for ARRR & ~10mins for KMD).
The website is currently in construction, and if you join, have any feedback, or request a specific assetchain to be added, please let me know.";"";"";

It is just a basic S-NOMP pool, still the included pages from the download. I am looking for some  asic miners to come and try it out, give it a good testing. Today just concentrating on KMD and looking for some of you to jump on and load it with hashing power. 1% fee to  cover the server and you get everything else you earn. I provide all testers with my contact info including text number if you need to contact me while you are testing. Plus i will be monitoring my PM on the discord. Please come and help me test and let's make some coin,  I have not gotten a URL yet so still using ip address+port for main page. There you will get the coins and ports for mining. Please behave yourself I will ban all IP's immeadiately attempting to poke around where you don't belong. PM me for details,  Thanks David";"";"";

Have screen shot can show you. 15th did sapling upgrade and not a single block since. I figured I missed something or messed something up. So I completely wiped the server and reinstalled all the daemons. I let all of them sync, KMD - ZEC -ZCL all done but ZEN is still working on it...22 hours later. Anyway for the past 5 hours myself and a friend put all our asics on KMD, mined hard at 600k+ kh/s.....we should have blocked in under 3 hours, we let it go to 4 hours and 15 minutes ......no blocks at all, The diff was only 720k and we have over 900k in shares when we gave up. ......help me out please, something changed drastically with the sapling upgrade and my pool is not mining KMD now.";"";"";
