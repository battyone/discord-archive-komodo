"323190823468531715";"$tefano.#3560";"09-Oct-18 02:08 PM";"innosilicon VS z9 mini in italy, my experience 

price of z9 mini now is ~1024$ (psu included +  shipping + duty tax of 22%)  for 15K/h and for 300 watt
price for innosilicon is ~4504$ (psu included + shipping + duty tax of 22% ) for 52K/h and 700 watt

4 x z9 mini = 4096$ - 95$ for 1 psu because 1 psu is for 2 z9mini  =~4000$ for 60/khs and 1200watt
so 4 x z9mini are better than a 1 innosilicon with +500$ less than innosilicon, +10 k/h that is +576,22€ 
(1 K/s = 4000/60 = 66$ x 10K/h = 660$  => 576,22€  )

electricity in italy is about 0,30 cent so 500 watt a day is about 3,6€
436,53€ + 576,22 = 1012,75 / 3.6€ day =  € 281days
