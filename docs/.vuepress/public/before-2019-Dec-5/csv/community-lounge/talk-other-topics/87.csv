"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"27-May-19 10:59 AM";"open source serves as a catalyst for innovation by drawing the participation of various developers around the world. few of the various new technologies, which are the main pillars of the fourth industrial revolution, have anything to do with open source. In the future, the seeds of innovation are likely to emerge first from open and decentralized open sources, not from a closed and bureaucratic system. Microsoft is betting on open source because it sees this point. Microsoft clearly understands that it is right to leave the flow to the dynamic currents because it is impossible to control the ocean completely. this is a valuable lesson learned after Microsoft gave up its hegemony in the mobile market to other rivals.

It is not yet clear what big picture Microsoft is painting with ION. perhaps Microsoft, as a rival to Google and Facebook, which have amassed huge amounts of personal information through multi-device simple logins, may use the ION. or it may use ION for services offered by its game platform Xbox and other game platforms in the face of Google's invasion of cloud games. In any case, Microsoft is likely to dominate the decentralized ID standard for now and then step on the pedal of popularization and commercialization in earnest when the market opens later.

Microsoft, in love with open source, has begun betting on bitcoin. bitcoin's neutrality, which has no interest in a particular entity, must have been an interesting subject of study for Microsoft, which realized the potential for open source. Microsoft's move to plan the deployment of services based on bitcoin public blockchain is markedly different from other companies that are issuing their own stable coins or building private blockchain mainnet. Microsoft's experience in transforming itself from a closed monopoly to a leading company for openness and innovation stands out. a proverb comes to mind: ""He who builds a castle is doomed, he who pierces a path is exuberant.""";"";"👌 (1)";
