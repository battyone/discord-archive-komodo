Freedom of speech means the government will not arrest you for speaking up. 
It does not mean that anyone is obligated to give you a platform for your BS.
It does not mean anyone is obligated to listen to you.
It does not mean the owner of an establishment can't throw your ass out for being an idiot (by their own definition, including people being offended at other people etc...).
If someone comes to my house & promotes [insert stuff I do not want to see in my house], off they go. I will censor the F* out of them, as is my right.
If I am [insert social network/business name here], I should be able to do the same.
Obviously there are consequences to that, including losing the business of people that do not agree with such behavior.";"";"";
