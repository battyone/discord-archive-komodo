When there is a need to exchange cash after using a personal key, the user can inform the individual key through 1:1 OTC transaction and receive cash. This method eliminates the need to pay taxes on bitcoin transfers/transfers.

I believe that the central bank's CBDC issuance is an attempt to tax the transfer/transfer/use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency by eventually creating a paperless world, in which records are traced to the digital world 'when electronic currency from the central bank and bitcoin are exchanged.' That's why the IMF also said, 'The electronicization of paper money can happen sooner than you think.'

Now it seems like a piece of facts, but in the end, a piece of the puzzle is coming together to make a picture.
