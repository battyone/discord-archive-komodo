the reason why MS is working on this system as an open source project is because of interoperability. users should be able to access other networks without the hassle of entering information by using ION's ID. however, a platform dominated by microsoft would not involve other vendors and would not be able to provide interoperability to do so. 

why did they choose bitcoin when there are many blockchains that are technically advanced, including ethereum? MS did not make any special comments, but by expanding the dynamics between dinosaur companies, reasoning is possible. bitcoin is a blockchain in which leadership does not exist. the absence of leadership seems to be a disadvantage of bitcoin, but the fact that it cannot agree or lead change also ironically means that the future of the system is predictable.

If the bitcoin system is a registered copy of the Internet DID transaction, what will be the price of bitcoin? the registry copy identifies the authenticity of the records, with 10,000 servers scattered around the world keeping the same copy. the approval is mining, but bitcoin, which is given as a reward to the miners, needs to be valuable for the authenticity of the approval. In other words, the more expensive bitcoin is, the more secure the system as a registered version of the DID. this means that most of the reasons why microsoft chose bitcoin can be explained by the high price of bitcoin. 

the news confirms again that attempts to separate bitcoin from blockchain were useless even on a practical level.";"";"👍 (1)";
"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"21-May-19 02:01 AM";"there has been criticism that Facebook officials have never participated in or been interested in the decentralized ID (DID) forum. this is because it indirectly confirms suspicions that Facebook is trying to establish a general-purpose ID on its own It may be a natural choice as the No. 1 company that has the most personal information. however, if Facebook does not participate, it is difficult to cruise DID project that focuses on general purpose. recently, however, Facebook has been embroiled in a controversy over its ""disband"" because of its dominant status. 

Chris Hughes, who is also Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's dormitory mate and co-founder of Facebook, caused a stir when he claimed it was ""now time to dismantle Facebook."" as Facebook uses its dominant position for commercial purposes, the existence of the company has begun to weigh on society as a whole. 

politicians in the U.S. are joining the campaign, especially democratic presidential hopefuls, who are joining the debate over privacy violations, weak security, circulation of fake news and low-paying labor. 

recently, Facebook announced that it will issue stable coin, or Libra Networks , using blockchain. however, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee expressed concern about the project in a letter. all allegations are based on the logic that Facebook further strengthens its dominant position by abusing personal information it secures.

for Facebook, it would prefer the option of expanding the world it already controls, rather than engaging in open source projects that no one can control. however, it is a paradox that this ambition, which is possible because of Facebook's dominant position, is becoming impossible because of its dominant position. the fact that Microsoft, once on the verge of splitting the company due to its dominant position, chose bitcoin is another reason why it is not simple.";"";"";

In Argentina and Sudan, bitcoin has renewed its high point in 2017.

Sudan is said to be twice as high as the high point. both Argentina and Sudan are due to inflation.

before bitcoin, ordinary citizens had no means of resisting ultra-high inflation. real estate or dollars are everything, but broken governments have the limits of not hesitating to arbitrarily requisition and ignoring individual ownership, making it difficult to take dollars or real estate outside the border.

when such cases are presented to the public, bitcoin skeptics often dismiss them as special cases. over the past decade, however, bitcoin has grown as a means of emergency in such special cases.

the monetary and financial world is far from being orderly and dull.

people seem to think that a few years of peace will last forever. the perception of people ignoring the fact that serenity is in fact a very special case is my greatest mystery.

compared to this mystery, the bitcoin phenomenon is difficult but also extremely common.";"";"";
