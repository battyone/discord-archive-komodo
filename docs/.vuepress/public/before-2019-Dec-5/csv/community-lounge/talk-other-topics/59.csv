Hernandez, like other economists, would have argued that bitcoin was not a currency and could not be a currency if it was a society that did not need bitcoin.
However, Hernandez, who is a living person who needs to feed his family in a place where economics and politics are collapsing before being an economist, testifies with such a force.
""Borderless currencies (like bitcoin) are more than just fashionable in a collapsing society,""

If the bitcoin is popular society, that society is definitely not a good society. But in such a desperate society, bitcoin has a unique value.

If it is an intellectual who does not change the idea that bitcoin is meaningless tulip, that is assuming that over 150 countries will not suffer social collapse as it is now and forever.

the fact that human history is not going to walk that flower road was the starting point of my accidental journey five years ago when I dared to anticipate the future of this bizarre and bizarre bitcoin.";"";"üëå (1)";

Putting securities on the blockchain is as natural as trading stocks on the Internet. Securities are rarely owned and traded in paper form. Investors are already familiar with trading hydrostatic electronic data while leaving it to the depository. 

However, stocks and bonds can be stored and traded only on a centralized platform under the jurisdiction of the regulatory agency as the trace of paper certificates remains strong. Regulators are justifying control in the name of linking electronic data with physical certificates. 

When securities are issued in blockchain, they go beyond the meaning of electronic rights to paper certificates. Blockchain tokens are divided infinitely. The right can be easily divided by freezing the token using an electronic signature Securities-type tokens are similar to real securities being stored directly on their smartphones. Financial firms cannot control all servers, after all, prevent direct transactions between users. This means that the remaining claim to multinational companies will be used as a strong global currency. 

In some countries, Samsung Electronics or Apple shares may gain more credibility than their own currency. Today the most fragile certificate is paper money issued by governments without restraint. However, even the people of the damaged government are coming to the public as the smartphone that Samsung and Apple have in their hands. The Chinese government is threatening to strictly ban the STO.

"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"06-Mar-19 01:13 PM";"Of course, if a company's securities token feels it threatens the status of a key currency like the dollar, the U.S. government can stop the token from being popular and crash it into meaningless code overnight. What regulators can't do about Bitcoin can be done to Apple or Amazon's securities token. 

This is why U.S. financial officials can be more attracted to securities-type tokens than Bitcoin. However, many governments that have forced their own promiscuous currency to the public are in trouble. Bitcoin could have misled itself as if buying tulips, but it would not be easy to develop a rational logic that prevents tokenized Apple securities from being used as currency.

"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"06-Mar-19 01:19 PM";"There are no significant statistics for the Security token issue (STO) market. However, polymath, the leader in securities-type tokens, expects to grow to the $10 trillion market within two years. The rationale for this optimistic market outlook is that regulators, including the United States, have a forward-looking attitude unlike ICOs. 
STO will proceed on the premise of cooperation with regulatory agencies. In the United States, cumbersome licensing procedures may be omitted by limiting the amount of money collected However, since token is also securities, it is mandatory to audit, disclose, and retain company ledger and be subject to securities related tax laws. In addition, the obligation to prevent money laundering should be complied with in the course of token issuance and distribution. 

As for STO, which raises funds by issuing new securities through blockchain tokens, different governments are likely to respond differently. However, the flow of existing securities being traded on a blockchain platform is not a matter of whether they should be bought or not, but a matter of time. In particular, considering the preparedness of major institutions, including NASDAQ, the timing will be earlier than expected.";"";"";
