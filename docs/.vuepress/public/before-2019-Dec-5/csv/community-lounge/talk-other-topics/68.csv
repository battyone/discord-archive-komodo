If you dig into the reasons, you can't explain yourself in the end except the logic that someone you trust believes. 

blockchain world has a new rose-light dream abound, which has to do with the reality that one wants to hide: poor knowledge and full of morale.

The ideal that is too good to be real and the worship of someone who is too noble to be human is the Holy Grail of a young day. the problem is that once you drink the Holy Grail, you can't ""gaining knowledge by the study of things"" with your head, and once you're done with it, you might have to pour in your three to 40s for a restoration campaign.

of course, a strong government like the United States can disable the system by blocking IBM headquarters or prosecuting executives. 

however, it is difficult for the Venezuelan or Zimbabwe governments to stop WorldWire in that way. blockchain will allow a large number of global citizen who have been unable to participate in the global supply chain. 

the reason is that blockchain allows the citizens to overcome government's interference.";"";"";
