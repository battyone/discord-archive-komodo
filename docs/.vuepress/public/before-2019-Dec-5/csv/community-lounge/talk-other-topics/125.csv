That should ensure that devs and external projects know that the **DEX core/API is open-source and completely free to use**. The end-user app is actually also free to use and publicly available for endusers - but integrating a new coin into the mobile app entails costs for the maintenance, monitoring, SPV server hosting, DEV team, support team, and much more - and without charging a fee we wouldn't be able to provide an A+ service/product.";"";"💯 (4)";

the model in earning in open source industry has always been what Komodo's Atomic Swap tech is doing.
Making the core of the tech open source
and having the extending or more focused products using that tech sold by 3rd party vendors
those 3rd party vendors earn money mostly by giving service for implementing the open source project for the corporates and enterprises or by selling their products made using these open source projects.
Those who don't understand this basic model of business in open source software industry are either ignorant or don't understand the basics of open source software industry.";"";"💯 (5)";

All written below is important, since our freedom is under attack! Consider it as a warning.
Many things have changed since Bitcoin Whitepaper published. Despite anonymity respect in Mr.Nakamoto times, now Cryptocurrency Exchanges ask us to provide all the information about our personality (photocopies of our IDs, selfies). Providing such personal data, we risk having our data leaked to public as result of hackers’ attacks, bad management, etc. Moreover, we all know that Cryptocurrency Exchanges forced to build KYC system on their platforms due to operating under Regulators’ pressure.

Now, the Regulators went totally nuts - they wish to ban all the OpenSource development related to cryptoсcurrencies. And I think cryptography itself, probably, will be the next target. 

You might think I'm writing BS, but have a look at this document - www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps19-22.pdf (page 18 (p 2.38)).
Now only the Coin Center has responded to the situation – please, type ""coincenter submitted comments to her majesty s treasury defending uk citizens right to develop and publish open source software"" in google request field to know more.

I think it is time for everyone to be aware of that. I think it is time to react.

We must be more active. We must come up with a number of statements regarding OpenSource, crypto and privacy, and publish them on change.org. We must spread this thing among all our friends, colleagues, schoolmates, etc. We must ask them for support, because our problem someday will be their problem too. We must reach any support we could. 
 
I am sure that some of you have better ideas. Feel free to share them. At least, please re-post this information further, so more people will be aware of the situation. 

Kind regards,
Another guy from crypto-universe.";"";"";
