I asked her, “What are people doing to buy food down there in Venezuela? Do people use Bitcoin?” 

She then responded saying, “No, not really. The government made it illegal to use cryptocurrency... But I have some family that tried to sell their house with Fake Bitcoin, and so I asked my husband to look into it, and he saved them from selling the house in return for Fake Bitcoin.”

I said, “Wow that’s crazy.” And took a nice little mental note lol
