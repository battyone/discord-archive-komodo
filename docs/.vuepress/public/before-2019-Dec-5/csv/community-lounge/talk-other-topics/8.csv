Regardless of the political situation of individual countries, bitcoin follows the global supply chain. If an individual participates in the global economy as a producer or consumer and receives financial support, the vision of time and space will be expanded. That means there is more possibility of studying, saving and investing for tomorrow. 

It would be like a huge tsunami to visualize a huge population trapped in a low-trust trap entering the world economy with their cell phones in their hands. The reason why elites like Rosiello gave up their comfortable and stable profession in Europe and conducted "" into Africa "" is probably because they saw the tsunami in advance.

Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, is considered one of the top three female characters in the world of cryptography, which is dominated by men. 

After graduating from Columbia University with a master's degree in international finance, he had a career in credit suisse. When working in credit suisse, he was in charge of the financial network in sub-Saharan Africa. vividly witnessed banks failing to function properly due to lack of financial infrastructure and outstanding manpower.";"";"";

You give a lot of power to a central serivce provider (like Facebook)

You cannot use their service without their permission, they become gatekeepers

They can change the rules at any point, maybe they decide to charge you more money for the service.
