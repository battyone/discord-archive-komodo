My crystal ball is broken, but if I had to guess, the entire crypto space isn't going to attract a whole lot of new people/interest until we start seeing bullish price action.  When things start running up, you are going to have a whole new wave of people getting interested and starting their descent into the rabbit hole.  Then you don't have so small of a market.  Its just so hard to get most normies/NPC's to even see the potential in Bitcoin and even fewer see it in smart contracts or anything deeper down the hole.";"";"";

The next BTC run will bring a lot of interest and KMD will benefit most from that wave if it has its products as polished as can be when the runup happens.  It would be great if Ideas by Nature finished their makeover prior to the run up. It would also be nice if privacy transactions could be done without synching the whole chain. We will get some disappointed folks if we are advertising private transactions.... but you have to synch up for 13 hours prior to sending your private tx. Heh.
