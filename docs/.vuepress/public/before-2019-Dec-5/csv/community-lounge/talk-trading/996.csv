Certain things are done well, others not so much. This discussion all started for me because I keep trying to point out something trivial like the logo looking like shit on dark mode CMC but team members are literally commenting on the post below my post. I think having a logo that looks like it didnt come out of a gif machine isnt _that_ important, but its easy to fix or acknowledge and looks more professional if its done right.";"";"";
