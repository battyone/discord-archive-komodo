When I was shopping recently for a new CC pistol, I ultimately decided on the Taurus pt 111.  It was half the price of the Nano, it has twice the capacity and higher user ratings.   It surely isn't a Beretta, but if you are adding to the collection, it may be something to consider in the future.";"";"";

Some are pretty awful, some are mediocre and some are quite nice.   I was really impressed with my pt 111 especially considering the price point.  But some Taurus' i wouldn't carry if you paid me.  I have never fired the tcp, but from what I understand about firefights, i want a bullet hose with deep reservoirs.   6+1 won't cut it for me and my twitchy finger.  I need 12.  Or more.  When KMD and the rest of my portfolio moons, my next carry gun will be the FiveseveN.  I think 20 rounds miiiiight be enough.";"";"";
