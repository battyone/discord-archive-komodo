"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Aug-18 07:27 AM";"but at 4TH, it seems unlikely anybody has a 10 cents mining cost and closer to 20 to 40 cents, even at 96 VRSC blocks";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Aug-18 07:38 AM";"that fact that trades are happening about 20 cents each, indicates there are miners with lower cost, the volumes are about 25% of daily new coins. so as long as the 96 blocks are here these prices are likely to be available at this volume. at the 48 halving, then half the supply and half again at 24. at progressively higher price as long as the hashrate doesnt go down";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"07-Aug-18 07:42 AM";"after the 96 and 48 miner sales, we then reach the 24 VRSC period where another 12 or so from unlocking the coins, so like a 36+ VRSC block reward and i think then we finally get some sort of stable equilbrium without any coin supply changes happening for 2 years. then as new releases increase adoption, we can see higher and higher prices. What the floor price will be at the 2 year period... that is still unclear,but it seems 50 cents is not an unreasonable guess. and yes, that means people selling at 20 cents are creating a nice bargain for the ""patient"" buyers willing to wait the eternity of 2.5 months";"";"";
