It all depends on the evaluator of the SuperNET asset manager who manages it's funds value and diversify it's portfolio to what class of assets and to what kind of assets in that class.
From that understanding I understand that SuperNET is NOT only strictly locked to ONLY Komodo Platform Ecosystem.
In my opinion it'd not be ideal to ONLY stick with KMD. The value of the whole cryptocurrency ecosystem is the ideal choice to be in.
And in case if it can have somehow reach it's target holdings, it's best for all the SuperNET holders.";"";"üëÜ (2),üíØ (2)";
