I saw a great TED talk by a guy who was advocating for profit charities... it was argued all the best CEO material would get taken up by for profit companies, with the general game plan that ""even if I want to work for a NFP, they all pay so badly I might as well use my skills now, save some money, and do something charitible later or start my own NFP once I have years of experience under my belt"".

For one thing if NFPs actually made more money, they would aquire more talent, and positive feedback loop would ensue. 

Working for an NFP may be the most noble choice, but not the most logical necessarily if you really want to make a difference (perhaps). Also competition that just comes from being in the market place, is a driver of innovation. NFP's generally aren't selling something, they are asking for something, with moral high ground. Moral high ground shouldn't be a reason not to innovate. 


So less talented CEO's making less money, less innovation (on average). Then a big company comes along with it's billions, and throws away some money at a charitable cause as an after thought for their PR campaign... while all these smaller companies work so hard";"";"";

windows has for more usage.
market segmant is what you non linux users don't understand, and guess that's where you confused with just end user stuff.
linux is all about backend and integral business tech. it dominates the technical world than other.
eth right now having much higher value than kmd you still think of it as from the point of view where its the time difference.
eth is like pet.com of early internet.
also, we can only do analogy of cryptocurrencies with linux windows and stuff like that.
in real each cryptocurrency has it's own value as it increased by team it increases.
if not satisfied by linux being just few million and where winblows is multi million
think how bitcoin is multi billion than others. It is open source. so not exactly direct comparision to operating systems. it is just new category of software which brings very new thing in market.
kmd if you don't understand correclty, is based on bitcoin than eth like architecture.
that means, if bitcoin is of X value, KMD when gets more adoption in business where you end users won't be expecting much of the things in use, it will be invisibly serving you in backend and that usage increase will in turn increase value of kmd.";"";"";

probably not my place to start talking about this stuff, I know tech better than the average user and have copies of many OS's and have tweaked them a lot for specific tasks, but won't have knowledge like most of you guys

I guess the idea here is that linux allows people to generate money and probably lots of it, but linux itself never really gains a valuation in the same way microsoft windows does, because linux isn't owned by a central company or packaged or sold in the same way (on average?). It's a decent analogy of why KMD should hold value I guess, if it is being used for lots of different money generating purposes, beyond measure.";"";"";
