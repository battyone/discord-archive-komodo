Zcash nodes keep lists of all the commitments that have been created, and all the nullifiers that have been revealed. Commitments and nullifiers are stored as hashes, to avoid disclosing any information about the commitments, or which nullifiers relate to which commitments.";"";"";

"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"31-May-19 08:42 PM";"When a shielded transaction is spent, the sender uses their spending key to publish a nullifier which is the hash of the secret unique number (""rho"") from an existing commitment that has not been spent, and provides a zero-knowledge proof demonstrating that they are authorized to spend it. This hash must not already be in the set of nullifiers tracking spent transactions kept by every node in the blockchain.

Nullifier = HASH(spending key, rho)

The zero-knowledge proof for a shielded transaction verifies that, in addition to the conditions listed above, the following assertions are also true:

For each input note, a revealed commitment exists.

The nullifiers and note commitments are computed correctly.

It is infeasible for the nullifier of an output note to collide with the nullifier of any other note.";"";"";

so as I said, the nullifiers are inside encryption, only the hash of the nullifier is public and that wont do any good to correlate it, even if your txid is leaked. really the all zaddr PIRATE is quite private and even if you tried, you have a hard time to lose the privacy. I think if you had an automatic tweeting of viewkeys for all your zaddrs, that would be what you need to do in order to lose your privacy";"";"";
