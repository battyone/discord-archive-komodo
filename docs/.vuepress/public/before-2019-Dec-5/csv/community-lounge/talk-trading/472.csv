You look at all exchanges and if you see a big enough difference in price like maybe 7% and more, you can try to buy where the price is low and sell on another exchange where the price is higher. You can make money that way when an exchange is starting and the bots are not already filling all the gaps automatically. But you can also loose a lot when you discover the price difference is due to deposits or withdrawals suspension, infamous ""wallet maintenance"" and such BS.";"";"üëå (1)";
