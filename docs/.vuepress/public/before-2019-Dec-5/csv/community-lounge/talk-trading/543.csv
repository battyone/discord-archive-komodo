To verify this, a tricky framework for analysis was put in place. Rather than looking at financial statements, sales, and stock price movements, they invest in a very small number of companies that can continue to grow with business models, research and development capabilities and outstanding management, and hold these shares for a long time.

He used to point out that the biggest loss in stock investment was selling a good company too early. If the company has long owned the company, it will generate phenomenal profits of tens to hundreds of times, but if the company sells it up by dozens of percent, it will be a loss in the long run. If you bought good company shares at a good price, you should make a sales decision based on fundamentals.";"";"üëå (1),üíØ (1),Komodo (1),üêô (1)";
