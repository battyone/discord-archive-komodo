Want creates a bias towards those that have from those that have not; be it wealth, bananas, or anything one places value on.
The larger inherent issue is that ""wealth"" and ""being wealthy"" are subjective terms that are more widely used by those that do not wish to do what is required to gain what they want by any means other than telling those that have such things that those things should be given freely to those that do not have them (for no other reason than those that do not have those things do, in fact, exist on the planet).";"";"üíØ (2)";
