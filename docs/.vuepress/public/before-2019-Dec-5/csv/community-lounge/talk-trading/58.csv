All this work is not much eye-catching, not at all, it's all done silently without shiny coindesk articles (that cost 20k each) or shilling by VIPs. The projects already on board are awesome and a lot more is coming. The price doesn't reflect this yet, but I'm happy that money and resources are spent on building long term foundations instead of wasted competing with the garbage of Eos, Tron or Verge on their own terms. If you look around in the channels the work being done on CC, Scaling and other aspects is awesome. I'm in this space from years and I can find only a few that come anything close.
