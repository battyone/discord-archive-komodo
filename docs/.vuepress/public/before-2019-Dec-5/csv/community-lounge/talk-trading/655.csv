The funds raised will help them build out their smart contract technology and operations for a series of innovative use cases” said Bill Shihara of Bittrex International. “Incubating projects like Vodi X is why we started Bittrex International in the first place and why the IEO platform is such a promising development in the blockchain industry. We look forward to this partnership and introducing our user base to Vodi X along with other exciting projects driving the blockchain revolution to the next level.”  
 
Vodi X is positioned on the already widely adopted mobile payments application, Vodi, boasting 5+ million users in over 200 countries. Vodi X is building a creatively gamified platform. It is conveniently available on any smartphone and easily accessible through the Vodi mobile application. Vodi X seeks to create millions of income opportunities for Vodi users (Vodeers) around the world to earn cryptocurrency (VDX) by doing small tasks (micro-tasks).The users of the present Vodi app already excitedly perform small tasks to earn loyalty and reward points (Vodi Points) so they can apply points to purchases right on Vodi; such as eGift cards, mobile recharges (top-ups) and international, long distance calling plans. These points are easy to earn on Vodi, just send a money transfer, buy a top-up, even chat or call your loved ones using the app, and Vodi points are applied immediately.
