One day it‚Äôs a trade truce that gets bullish hearts racing. The next day the Dow falls 800 points.

But none of the sponsored commentators touch on the real reason‚Ä¶the US market is not just overvalued, it is in over-overvalued territory. Therefore, it must fall‚Ä¶and fall hard.

The US bull market of 2009‚Äì2018 is over. Now it is time for the bear to go to work.

And what a mauling it‚Äôs going to be.

It‚Äôs shaping up to be almost as severe as what bitcoin believers have suffered so far ‚Äî a loss of up to 80% in value.```";"";"";
