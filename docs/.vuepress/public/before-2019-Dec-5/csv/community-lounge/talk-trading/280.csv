It kind of looks like the only portion of my funds that were not generating rewards were the last bit of rewards/interest.  If that is the case, it is kind of confusing to have that warning.  I would call that a bug, low severity, but if it is constantly warning about a portion of one's KMD that by definition is a tiny percentage (less than 1 month's worth of interest), people are going to be claiming rewards more often than they should, paying unnecessary transaction fees.";"";"";
