is it looks right now, you are nothing but an overzealous acolyte burning himself on a trashy project. while nobody can prevent you from hitting yourself on the head with a hammer, you should understand that that the noise you are making while doing that is getting  mightily on peoples nerves that know better [ _refrains with superhuman strength from plastering two rows of monkey emos_ ]";"";"";
