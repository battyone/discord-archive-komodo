"457884604167225374";"meatspoon#7860";"08-Nov-18 07:12 PM";"Good question, I am not sure.  I would imagine there are lots of ways that the SEC can apply pressure outside of the US borders (in addition to it being very FUD'y if the SEC singles a project out).  The SEC could probably lean on whatever government to try and get them to do their bidding.  So CB's solution I think has a good shot.  The devs are anonymous and they are trying to make it so they can completely step away from the project and just let the gateways handle things.  So in theory, a gateway could get shut down if it were in a jurisdiction controlled or influenced by the SEC... but that would be just one coin on an exchange and someone on the other side of the world could reopen that same coin/gateway.";"";"";
