The logo looks like a little amoeba or some kind of cell structure, generating from its nucleus or core a copy of itself. 

I think if considered from a tech standpoint or philosophically it is an adequate or fitting symbol, like spawning chains from the mainchain, generating clones from the original.";"";"üî• (8)";
