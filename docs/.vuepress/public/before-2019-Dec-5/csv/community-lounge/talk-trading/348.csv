Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, or combination thereof is created for an established brand with the intention of developing a new, differentiated identity in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders.";"";"";

The Bitcoin/Dollar rate is trending inside a bear flag while eyeing a potential inverse head and shoulder breakout. We have two possibilities as the pair trends ahead. The first one is a reversal that could see the pair test support near the 100-period moving average or form a double bottom at 3127-fiat in an extended selling action. The second possibility is an extended upside run towards 4414-fiat upon breaking the intermediate resistance at 4038-fiat. The latter would establish an inverse H&S while a breakout above 4414-fiat will fix the next target at 4750-fiat or less.

There are mainly two reasons why we are doing the rebrand.

#1 Repositioning the Komodo brand in the eyes of the investors / developers

> If implemented properly, a change to the positioning and brand promise of a company has major consequences for the organization. Everything is adapted in line with the organization‚Äôs new strategy and promise, its products or services, HR policy, customer contact, corporate identity, and so on. Rebranding makes this change visible for all stakeholders.

#2 Outdated Image (many outlets still say Komodo is a privacy coin)

> One of the most common reasons for undertaking a corporate rebranding project is modernization. Trends mean that over time brands come across as old-fashioned if they have not been updated. 

In other words, the Komodo technology has changed/evolved so much during the past 1-2 years that we want to reintroduce the whole thing through this rebrand.";"";"üëç (4),üëå (3),2561_feelsevilman (1),Komodo (1),treasure (1)";
