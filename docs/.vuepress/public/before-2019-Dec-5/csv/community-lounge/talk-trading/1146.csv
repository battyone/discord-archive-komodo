The people who have sold to help reach this point of an ATL sat price despite all the developments.  We are nearly bottom of the barrel with price and not even in top 50.  And yes, at THIS POINT where we are in the beta with the live version on the horizon it is about marketing.  We‚Äôve got enough ‚Äúcreated value‚Äù but not enough eyes on it.

And Atomicdex is phenomenal but to your point it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôll launch it and all of a sudden there will be more revenue.  You can‚Äôt market without a product and you can‚Äôt have adoption to a product without marketing.  I think I‚Äôd just like to see more of a balance between the two but it was recently mentioned there won‚Äôt be a push until after beta.  Seems like a good time to push for more buzz.
