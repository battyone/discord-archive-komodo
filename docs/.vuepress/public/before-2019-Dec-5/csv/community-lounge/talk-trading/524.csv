1) prior to the IEO annoucement, exchanges create buy orders and slowly buy their own tokens.
2) annouce the IEO, which will likely be buyable with their exchanges tokens (like Binance bnb or Huobi HT), the market will likely react to this and pump their tokens.
3) Slowly sell the tokens bought at step 1 to take the profit, and use this profit to create buy orders on IEO after listing it , this could help to keep the price above IEO price , also create good momentum for the next IEO.";"";"";
