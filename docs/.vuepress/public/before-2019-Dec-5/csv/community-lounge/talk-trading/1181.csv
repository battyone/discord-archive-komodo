If we have one hope of using AtomicDEX then this is not good! The project will grow only with the participation of major players! Where will the venture capital investments be? Who will explain why one of the many venture companies should invest in KMD? What is the incentive when an open source project, despite such innovations, goes unnoticed and does not attract big money even at the lowest price? The trading volumes indicate that the coin is not interesting now to absolutely no big, not small investors, and without investors, even the coolest project is doomed - it is simply copied by enterprising Chinese. - they will register in the jurisdiction of Singapore and conduct such marketing that everyone will forget KMD with the words: ""why do we need KMD if there is a ""..... chain""  that has all komodo chips but also marketing like Tron and deflation like BNB which is all they accuse them of centralization but forget that they are developing their own DEX in which integrating atomic permutations and all sorts of Antara analogs is not a problem! Maybe the team might think about creating a similarity of DeFi, Maker and the like inside the chain? for a wide range of investors, the Chinese conc annuities will take the best and leave us overboard - after all, the same original idea with confidential ones failed and the ARRR chain is dead in fact now because whoever looks at it while there are Monero, ZEN, ZEC and simple bitcoin mixers! Thatâ€™s left at the end of BTC and a few Chinese projects that have a lot of money not only to hire the best developers in the world but also to conduct top-level marketing!";"";"";
