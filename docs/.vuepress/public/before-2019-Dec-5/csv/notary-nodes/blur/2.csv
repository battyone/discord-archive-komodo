1.) CryptoNote is a protocol. CryptoNight is the hashing algorithm. They are worth being separate, in my opinion. 
2.) Being fully transparent, nothing about our current algorithm *prevents* pooled mining, just as CryptoNight-adaptive did not. In the long run, that may prove an exercise in futility. Rather than trying to remain pool resistant, we‚Äôre going to look to incentivize solo mining and try to make pools illogical. 

Why resist what miners *want* when you can make them *want something else*? I think incentives are what drove us here in terms of spec mining hardware, and pools... and I believe only incentives, with some help from faction-based inclusion of all miners and hardware, can correct the course we‚Äôve been running off toward. 

Our algorithm in CN-Dynamicv2 makes use of the previous blocks hash, a current timestamp from the daemon being hashed on, and the block height to create variation on an both, an inter-block and intra-block basis.  Most notably the the PRNG afforded by the previous block‚Äôs hash contributes the largest portion of this variation. We take the first 6 characters from the hash in hex, interpret that as an integer, and use it as a necessary variable in the calculation for iterations that are used at various points within the CryptoNight algorithm. Using constants in that calculation that aren‚Äôt known at compile time is what makes our algorithm CPU-specific. 

The unique algorithm has the added bonus of making our current implementation non-compatible with current pooled software. That‚Äôs very far from saying it couldn‚Äôt be done. These things will always find a way if incentives are there. This is why we don‚Äôt want to play cat-and-mouse. Our job is to make the mouse faster, and give the cat a new activity as well üòâ";"";"";

Hey all, just wanted to keep everyone over here in KMD world informed on the changes taking place with regard to DPoW.  

Porting all of the BTC-derived code is taking a while, but things are moving along smoothly... particularly as of late.  Things finally beginning to click between XMR-BTC, mentally speaking.

At the following repo you'll see some recent changes (not all have been pushed yet, as I am trying to keep that repository in a state that actually builds without treating warnings as errors): https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur";"";"üëç (3)";
"402649850241482752";"Biz#0842";"05-Jun-19 07:09 AM";"**Among those changes that have been pushed are:**

- There is now a binary that builds with the set of blur-specific bins that is titled `blur-notary-server-rpc`.  This will become the binary that will create the notarization transactions on BLUR's chain, once  the data has been written to into a raw btc transaction. 
- That raw BTC data is going to be affixed to the 'extra' field of a BLUR transaction.  This subfield in the `tx_extra` will be prefixed by a leading byte of `0x05` which will be unique to notarization transactions.  I am going to attempt to keep that an authenticated field, meaning only NN secret keys will be able to create this type of transaction (ideally).
- Can't promise the authentication, since this field is not verified for content by any node (as far as consensus goes). But since we are making changes to consensus anyway, I figure its worth a shot (really just mitigates performance hit from verification happening too often). 
- If you wish to compile that repo on your own you can also use the JSON-RPC calls for `notarization_data`, `height_MoM`, and `calc_MoM` to make a call to each of those three methods on the daemon.  I'll be adding documentation for these later on. 
- The above RPC calls will eventually be populated with data from the komodo state files, iguana's methods for merkle tree calculations, and all that good stuff.
- The backbone of the RPC calls and the notarization server are built.  So, what's left is a matter of actually plugging these functions into the RPC calls and making sure they work properly once that's complete.";"";"";

I am physically plugging all of the functions into our existing interfaces.

"402649850241482752";"Biz#0842";"16-Jul-19 11:26 PM";"**An update on the state of DPoW integrations:** here

**1.) Notary Node  addresses & wallet building is underway. You can see the beginnings of the address work  here: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/1d4397c4da4b70eb3a66a911c4e3c78b1c138b53).**

Understanding how this will work with NN pubkeys, requires a little background on XMR addresses.  In monero's ecosystem, each wallet address consists of two separate keypairs (4 keys in total, 2 public, 2 private). These consist of a viewkey pair, and a spendkey pair.  If keys are truly independent (they are deterministic in XMR, but will *not* be for notary nodes), the private viewkey can be used by third parties to transparently view the transactions. This is possible without the viewer having any way to actually compromise the funds of the wallet in question.  

 jl777 and I spoke about about ways to employ the existing BTC pubkeys that notary nodes currently use, and avoid requiring submission of private keys of any kind... What we settled on was repurposing the current btc pubkeys as private viewkeys for  notary nodes on BLUR.  For the other keypair (spendkey), a new crypto library, built on Ed25519 and GIMLI permutations, called `libhydrogen` will be used to generate a high entropy secret spendkey.

This means that NN operators will only have  to provide their pubkey on startup of `blur-notary-server-rpc`, and a unique wallet address will then be generated.";"";"";
"402649850241482752";"Biz#0842";"16-Jul-19 11:27 PM";"**2.) An extra parameter for dpowconfs has been added to the wallet, and notary wallets: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/38d8a482302a57479d1b4e174d6b74145171e6d7).**

**3.) All of the types, classes, etc necessary from bitcoin have been consolidated into the directory `external/bitcoin` (which compiles as a static library).**

 I've also added a couple helper functions in `src/common/hex_str.cpp` for conversions between the two codebases. Converting from BTC style `uint256` to cryptonote's `crypto::hash` is pretty simple this way, and we don't have to do any crazy type-punning.

**4.) Unique `ntz_txn` tags & fields in the extra have been added, and have preliminarily been given a buffer of 4kB or so.** (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/f6deef44d41847c7e8125e40c606379cc325af27 & https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/6ade53a6548c983dae100ef24159548ba188c999)";"";"";
"402649850241482752";"Biz#0842";"16-Jul-19 11:29 PM";"**5.) komodo-related DPoW functions have been built with main lines into `cryptonote::core` via the `komodo_core` class.**  This class has a constructor that initializes `m_core` and `m_p2p` as references to `cryptonote::core` and `node_server`.  These are the two handlers that dictate consensus, effectively.

 - Here, core will allow us to load in state files, checkpoints, etc.  There are already placeholder functions (without bodies) for this.  You'll find all of `komodo_core` located in `src/komodo/komodo_validation.cpp & .h`

In BLUR consensus decisions begin in `core` and `p2p` as far as network communication goes.  These decisions are then finalized in `src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp` where they are added to the blockchain, or rejected based on verification & hard fork rules.";"";"";

It is not a premine in my eyes but it is close to it. nothing personal here, I'm talking about the profits that we can do when mining a coin and when we read BTC each day (I stopped and I stick to KMD discord to find gems)";"";"";
