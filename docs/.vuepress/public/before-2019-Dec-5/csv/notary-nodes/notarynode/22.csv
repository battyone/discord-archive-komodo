As utxo optimizations exists to minimize the time a `listunspent` call takes, people are working hard to keep their utxo counts very, very low. However, as a side-effect people using this strategy split very often. I personally split funds on average about every 10 minutes.

I have the following questions:
- Is frequent splitting (and then rapid consumption of those UTXOs) actually BETTER for the network's health as it reduces the overall size of the unspent output database?
- OR, would less frequent splitting (resulting in fewer transactions) combined with some `listunspent` notarization optimization (to return early for example once a certain threshold of appropriated sized utxos have been found) be better for the network?";"";"";

I get what you mean here, and I discussed this with Decker, before he went on holidays. A cache of some kind on the deamon side would be perfect, as the deamons have an event of a spend, or receive of UTXO it can use to update this cache. 

Personally, I have started using the `time` command to test the exact time it takes to `listunspent` and tbh, I'm not finding a *huge* diffrence. Its `ms` at best, which is weird, as network latency for me is 400ms to quite a few nodes. So this tiny amount of time, seems mostly irrelevant. My real world findings suggest heavily the opposite to this though, and I am lost as to why.

The biggest issue we have with using such low utxo on KMD (only KMD, nothing else matters for this) is that iguana selects its utxo's by random, and one dpow loop currently does not have the info required to know if that utxo has already been chosen. By lowering hte counts of utxo, we are increasing the chance for a failed notarization round. This does not seem to effect total counts however, as people using very agressive optimisations like Luke are still doing perfectly fine.";"";"";
