What dwy has said is just about right read the scripts understand what does what. There are many ways to improve. Comes down to responding the fastest to other nodes. That's exactly how to get better counts. The hard part is finding something that makes you respond faster. Less utxo means less to process. You can also customise the notarizer to make it just respond faster...";"";"";
