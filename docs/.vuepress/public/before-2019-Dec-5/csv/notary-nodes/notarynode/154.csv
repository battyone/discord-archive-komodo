This is not the right way to think about it.   A blockchain must be secure against attacks, thats the entire point.  No one should trust something if a bad actor could break it without tremendous difficulty";"";"";

This is what KMD DPoW is designed to prevent.  You cannot do a deep chain reorg because some of those blocks got notorized.   Alternately, if no notorizations happened, then you cannot trust that a transaction has been confirmed";"";"";

I can't imagine what about me would lead you to believe that I wouldn't take something like that seriously, emmanuel
You literally spent 16 hrs droning on about there being ""barrier to entry"" and I did the best I can do to help that situation.
I'm not sure what about my history in this community would lead you to believe that I *wouldn't* take a project like that seriously.
What really pisses me off is more about the childish action, itself, after giving a place to begin what you asked for than it being aimed at me.
Have you ever submitted a PR to james repo like that? Or is it just personal disrespect towards me? Or was all the droning on just a bunch of you stirring shit with that big ass spoon?";"";"";
