Optimization of software gave my node a chance but I chose to share my results with everyone else and lost the advantage gained, as I felt that was better for the network as a whole. I dont mind running election again next year, my node is able to maintain average performance in my region despite its old hardware and bad location. Still have plenty if resources for expansion as I am using 48 core quad CPU older server for the massive amount of ram available for much less upfront cost, although something faster can be rented elsewhere for less per month than I currently pay.";"";"üëç (1)";

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"16-Feb-19 10:05 PM";"I agree with that. For me I started with very little experience in all this, so purchased a cheap server upfront and built many nodes on it at home until I got it right, at the time that was my cheapest option, renting from a host for testnet wasn't something I could afford to do. Its all depends on what u can do. The best nodes are mostly dedicated servers owned by the operator, such as shossains and deckers. I think if mine was on the opposite aide of Australia, where most of the SH nodes are it would be much much better. Even with old hardware. I found disk speed and vast amounts of ram to be the highest requirement then number of CPU cores. The CPU speed per sore is less important, but affects restart times of daemons and as such gets up notarizing faster after updates, or if bad things happen resyncs of chains.";"";"";
