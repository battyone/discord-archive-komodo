i agree with ludom, it is quite shady and it makes me sad to read 

-what numbers of node are automatically reelected and how many spots available? 
this point is very clear this year to mee, that's cool
-what is the limit to push your proposal? 
in practice before the activation of new set of notaries as we need a pubkey
but if we put a date, let's put a date, not a ""you are encouraged to do it before that date""
-what metrics are taken into account for auto re-election? 
aah for this one the answers were quite frightening to me 
only BTC taken into account because no reliable stats for AC? We are daily watching komodostats and it is finally not the source of counting? 

Ok I am here for enough time to trust most of you but it is not very serious for newcomers in search of decentralized elections, or when you try to explain this great project to someone
i also know kolo is doing is best as election master 
now, these 3 points have be risen because not clear last year around the same moment (too late) and we already said that we should discuss about rules earlier in the year (and come one day to a more automated process)
