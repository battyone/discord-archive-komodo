Well, exposure to the project is a much needed and overlooked aspect. 
""Community and BizDev"" is highly needed, despite many peoples claims/feelings to the contrary.
For example, 
I believe @TwilightPunkster K64 , while roped in by Myese ( through community development), was eventually sold on KMD by me.  He and I spent countless hours on the phone last week and ultimately I sent him 1,000 of my personal KMD stack to him as a sign of good faith from the community that we will support him any way we can.   He is an amazing human with an amazing attitude and work ethic. 

He flat out wanted to turn down the 7,777 bounty for an SDK at first.   Flat out.  
To say he hasn't been amazing for the community in his first week is not something anyone would agree with. 
If he disagrees with me, he won't hesitate to say it, I am sure.  There are many others here due to my direct involvement with community growth, mostly KMD. 
https://twitter.com/2ndOldest/status/1104762636292448256

So yes, community building and development has intangibles that are extremely valuable to the ecosystem.
That said, I'm only 1/2 of the team.  @mrlynch is the dev side.  He is working on many things developmentally related to z address functions as well as ecosystem building in addition to my work on Bizdev for adoption.  Please see his proposal for more information.  
In addition to this, 80% of the rewards are supporting the ecosystem including Pirate, LABS, Verus and the community users. 
Only 20% of the mining rewards are going to the operators, 100% of which I am committing to Mr. Lynch.
So no, mining rewards are not directly going to ""Support social and community growth"".
I hope that bounties as a solution to social and community involvement aren't really thought of as the best way to engage community and integration outlets.

That's huge and that's going to take a lot of business and community development to achieve adoption.  
Achieving a node or two for Pirate will allow more funds for freelance developers such as @radix42 who is working on a KMD full node port for me to the Nodl and for Satinder to the RISC-V.  To pay @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ for enabling new functionality to old wallet.  To support @webworker01 for his work on all things Pirate related.  To @Deleted User for his work on Tortuga... and so on.

To put it Simply, Mr. Lynch is in fact considering taking his job to part time to focus on Node operation, and development for pirate, it's projects and so on.  He reached out about the Python wrapper but it appears @Deleted User is already working on it.   
I assure you, the ""bizdev"" (hate that phrase by the way :P) is only 1/2 of our users.
