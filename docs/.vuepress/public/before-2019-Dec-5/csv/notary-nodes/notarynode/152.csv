Now Nick@ luxor is planning to or already has reached out to @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 because he was the one who created pirate solo, I didn't do this for this ""campaign"" and I don't care if we lose

However I wanted to share a very real result of basically my goals and potential value of expanding the KMD ecosystem whether its with a lot of small victories or also larger ones down the road. I believe everyone would agree a professional mining pool (which also sports a new payout scheme to the coins PPS) is always a welcome addition, especially for multiple KMD coins -- whats next maybe they'll add a veruscoin pool for @miketout 

The value proposition of my NN campaign could be explained in the example above, so contrary to @Alright criticism I believe I have one of the most unique proposals that aims to add value in a way that is not heavily focused on currently or historically.";"";"👍 (1),👌 (1)";

On mainnet there are 64 NN & minsigs is 13, which means only 13 NN are required to sign a nota transaction. So worst case scenario,  if 64 NN are separated into 4 groups  (each group has 13 NN at least and they don't see each other), theoretically we could see quadruple notas. It is not a risk as long as all NN are on the same chain, the only thing is they spend 4 times as much as required.
