Yes it's unbelievable how my node picked up. Here is what I did ( click to see):  || I doubled check my router settings, firewall and fail2ban and made sure all the p2p ports are open and I added all the ip of all notaries in fail2ban so they never trigger it. I also added maxconnections=125 to each of my .conf files. But my peers are still 16-16-16-14 though... Before that I also sent to myself to merge my utxo and use komodo-cli cleanwallettransactions but it didn't clean that much I will add a daily cron for that. I also setup iguana to not autosplit. And a cron job every 2 hours to split KMD to 60 and AC to 20 using Decker script.||";"";"😄 (1)";
