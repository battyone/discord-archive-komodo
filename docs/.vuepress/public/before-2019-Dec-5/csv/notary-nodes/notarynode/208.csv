One pubkey should be generated by iguana (""btcpubkey"" field in iguana encryptwallet method output) as written in manual. It will be used for dpowing komodo to BTC and all assets into komodo. It's your main pubkey.
Second pubkey will be used for 3rd party coins notarizing. It should be generated same way as above, but with different passphrase.

You all know the safety rules, but I would like to remind:
1. Keep both passphrases (seeds) SAFE. It's main thing from which all your wallets, keys etc are generated deterministically. Knowing seed/passphrase means knowing all BTC, KMD and other privkeys.
2. Keep it really SAFE. Compromising your passphrase (as well as privkey) means your notary is done once and forever. We can't (100%!) revoke, recover, change or tweak pubkeys in komodod once they are hardforked in.
3. Make sure they are correct. As said above - we can't fix them or change later. It's blockchain. 

We already had notary ops lost everything because accidentally sending privkey to public chat or because evernote hacked. They just lost their spot and network got couple of dead servers.

Deadline is one week.";"";"✅ (2),👌 (3),Komodo (10),yassinkomodo (2)";
