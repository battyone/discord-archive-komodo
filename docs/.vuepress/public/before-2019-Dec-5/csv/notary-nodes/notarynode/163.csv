We just exchanged spots AR <-> EU, bcz it was comfortable for me to place hardware in AR, and for SHossain in EU. But you can count that decker_EU is equal to alien_AR and alien_AR is equal to decker_EU . Just @SHossain controls my decker_EU node which is named alien_AR and me controls alien_AR node which is called decker_EU. Now ... let's see the stats ... both nodes is in TOP of their regions. Mean, decker_EU win the spot and alien_AR win the spot ... doesn't matter who actually control each of them, me or @SHossain ... and `0dev4_decker` is just an `dev` node for 2019 ... So, AR region **owe** us a spot ) But i'm just agree with Kolo's decisions ... and i wish to see a ""new blood"" in a NN rows.
