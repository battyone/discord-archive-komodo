As infotech-al, I've just read the convo and prefer to stay out of it.
My english and my technical knoledge aren't good enough to participate to convos like this one, sorry.
From what I've understood, Dwy could have found a weakness in the system, and blackjok3r has already PR'ed something, so that's great!
