At the core, Ubuntu comes from the testing branch of Debian.
But that's where the end of comparing it to anything around here comes.
Ubuntu adds their own software and whatever outside packages they choose and have a fixed 6 month release cycle (even if many know issues exist).
Debian tests and tests and tests and releases with no fixed date and only when it's decided to be as stable as humanly possible under as many conditions as possible.";"";"";

- - The `rpcallowip` option can no longer be used to automatically listen
  on all network interfaces.  Instead, the `rpcbind` parameter must be
  used to specify the IP addresses to listen on.  Listening for RPC
  commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be
  disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a
  configuration.  If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like
  Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g. `docker run
  [...] -p 127.0.0.1:8332:8332` (this is an extra `:8332` over the
  normal Docker port specification).

- - The `rpcpassword` option now causes a startup error if the password
  set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's
  ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a
  comment.

Starting with Bitcoin Core 0.20 (expected about
  a year after 0.18), Bitcoin Core will default to native segwit
  addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other
  benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending
  to bech32 addresses, and if the Bitcoin Core project sees enough
  additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving
  addresses in Bitcoin Core 0.19 (approximately November 2019).
