https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/d0ct0r

The latest and most significant addition made to my proposal reflects redistribution of KMD NN rewards directly to active members of the KMD Discord community. If elected then I pledge 10% (or more! üòâ ) of all of my KMD rewards will be put towards KMD Discord community game prizes, most specifically towards regularly scheduled Discord Chat trivia session winners and host(s).
I am open to suggestions as to just when and with what frequency trivia events will be held. I have seen many formats work, things can become particularly interesting with 'special' guest hosts..
i.e. Math trivia night.. I probably should not be the one to host this particular trivia session üòÅ Seems there are plenty of number crunchers around here who could have a field day with some math trivia / challenges though.
Thanks for all of the support / assistance from so many of you current NN operators! Super cool group here and I hope to become a meaningful part of it for a long time to come!";"";"";
