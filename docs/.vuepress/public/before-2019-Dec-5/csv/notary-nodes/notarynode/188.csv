I agree that we are all doing our best, and that many good things have come out of our experiences here.
From my perspective, this seems like a squad of firefighters in the station preparing and organizing their gear, meanwhile a nearby house is burning down though. 
As a testnet I see this current situation as a great opportunity to also improve.  As the simulated attack was.";"";"";
