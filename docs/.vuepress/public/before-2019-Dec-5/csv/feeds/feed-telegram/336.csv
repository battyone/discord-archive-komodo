A lot of people DM'ed me about it. It is a quite simple strategy. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. This gives our members a perfect window to sell their coins with a decent profit.
We have done a quite similar strategy a few months ago on the coins $DLT and $DNT. The results were amazing. Pictures  will be shared below.

""TwilightPunkster K64Today at 2:21 PM
I was planning to keep this announcement for a lot later, but as the CEO of Komodore64, I can give you the following statement.
When Ben Fairbank visited us in the Netherlands, we put some things in writing - but also had some verbal agreements. That there will be a Komodo Foundation and that K64 will migrate to a Komodo ""Enterprise"" edition in the future. 
For other projects, I have requested our advisor, Lord Ajay Sharma from ASR ventures, former president of Rotary to find the right people to take chair in what we call the K64 Foundation. We already have found a suitable secretary who will be announced on June 14th, and two other positions are still in negotiation. As soon as its passed legal procedures - notary, statutes - the K64 foundation will donate to Komodo Foundation to ensure its health.
Do not worry. Let the Komodo Team investigate and perform fact-finding. We will overcome this.
Together we are strong.""";"";"";
