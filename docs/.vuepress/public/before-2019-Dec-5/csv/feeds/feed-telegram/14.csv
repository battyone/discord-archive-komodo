When you've got a decent group talking about us, we need to amplify it. Use our network effect. For fks sake 1 million tx/s.. No wonder we don't move, there's so few likes people think it's just vapor ware and move on (re @Regnar: CALLING TWITTER USERS!!
Getting some more outside KMD publicity. This isn't an advertisement for Cryptocollective, but a way for us to have a show of force in social media to drive outside content providers to check out KMD and display it to their followers. These guys have about 3600 followers on their Twitter and are about diverse coin content which means their followers are likely looking to them for additional coin info. They have an additional 7K followers on instagram, presence on LinkedIn and have ICO reviews and research stuff. So if we show support for KMD on their tweets ABOUT KMD then it's likely they'll tweet more about it and share on more of their social media platforms and potentially pitch it to their clients.
So go like this tweet, comment on it about what you love about KMD, what you think of the project, what type of content you want to see more of (KMD ;) ) tag your friends and other crypto pages and retweet to your followers.
