I could be wrong here, Atomicdex may end up like this. However Binance uses APIs to their own servers which are very light, that is the benefit of being centralized, but with the obvious drawbacks (sim swap attacks, hacks, disabled wallets, regulation etc) (re @Craig: Thanks for all the in depth responses regnar. You're a passionate guy. 
Let me try to phrase a question that's important to me. 
Take IDEX.
You visit the website and there's a funny thing you need to do, ""unlocking your wallet"". A few other funny things later when you want to ""withdraw""
This throws off some people. But people know it's a DEX or something a little weird. So most people push on past the weirdness.
Honestly it's probably because IDEX has interesting coins that aren't listed anywhere else, not because the average user really cares about holding their keys.
 But no worries, they push on.
One big reason is they push on is because there's a list of like 100 tokens, visible on the front page, that gives their daily volume and % change in price. Also there are charts. Basically it looks like an underdesigned version of binance or another CEX.
The user then goes about his business trading with just a few quirks. Also things are slow, the website kinda lags, but it's ok because it's a DEX and a lot of coins are only possible to find there.
So the vision for atomicDEX, is it similar to that? Where a user will have to accept a few minor annoying tradeoffs in order to trade in a way roughly like a centralized exchange? 
Or is using atomicDEX going to be a radically different experience than a centralized exchange?
Another way to put it:
What tradeoffs will atomic dex accept, and what bonuses will it have besides less counterparty risk, no kycaml, your keys your coins?)";"";"";

There are already desktop apps that are sharing liquidity and using the Atomicapi to trade desktop with mobile. 
AtomicDEX being a mobile app, I don't expect to take on the role if a full fledged trading DEX app, it might be this in the future with charts and order types etc. But I personally think it would be better positioned against instant swap services like changelly and shapeshift, like it was suggested here to simple have a ""best price/instant swap"" setting. I think mobile apps should keep functionality as basic and simple as possible, let websites have tons of features. but I don't make these decisions. (re @Craig: Framing it as an OTC market helps thanks.
Here i am saying I hate trading and then complaining there aren't enough features. 
It's just, there are other DEXs out there that have, or plan to have, a lot more that OTC style markets. Im not sure I ever expected leverage or derivatives and so on with atomicDEX.

https://dexstats.info/finddeposit.php (re @Amalgamus: Thanks for answering. That's how I wrecked my computer. As i had tried all I could with my very limited capacity, I ended up installing linux and was never able to claim anything by myself. What I find frustrating is that when you send those coins they tell you you can claim them back easily. But why the address you sent them to doesn't sent them back when the option to claim them back just disappeared from your wallet?
