It's very specific, but because of this the fee is pretty standard. Think of when you see someone in here offering a trade, they could go to an exchange but it's a pain, especially if the volume doesn't support the trade (youd have to coordinate you and your trading partner putting the orders up at the same time, and even still you may buy at higher or lower than agreed)
So instead they go to Barterlly, make the trade, send a message with the trade link to whomever, or broadcast it. And it just gets done (re @kremer (n k): I've never used an OTC market before, only Central exchanges. Wasn't aware the rates on OTC were such)";"";"";
