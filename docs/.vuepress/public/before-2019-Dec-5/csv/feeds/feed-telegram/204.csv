Depending on how you do your orderbooks there may be a way to incorporate atomic swaps and potentially the new market maker 2.0. Even though it seems you will be up and running before MM2, it would be a huge benefit to you to offer liquidity on market maker on the backend too. This would help you fulfill more transactions without being limited to the direct traffic to your exchange. I don't imagine this being a problem with your KYC procedures since you are getting your liquidity from other exchanges and cannot rely on them to perform KYC/AML on the coins that come to you.
