(re @Regnar: That's not how value is derived, by any economic school of thought. First of all, you're confusing value with PRICE, in a ceteris paribus economic model an increase in supply with constant demand would lower price, but markets price in expected growth of supply, which is WHY predictable inflation of a currency is important, even Bitcoin supply is inflating. 
Secondly, bring your statement which you say isn't hard to understand, to its logical conclusion. IF value increases when Supply goes down, then any coin would be most VALUABLE as supply approaches zero. But value isn't derived this way, because a currency is considered valuable because of other attributes (fungibility, divisibility, store of value, MoE, network effect etc) a single coin (or really small amount of coins) isnt good at pretty much any of this (unless it is hugely divisible, then you are just changing the scale of the supply anyway))";"";"";
