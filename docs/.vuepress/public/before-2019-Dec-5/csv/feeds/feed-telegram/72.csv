45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.
However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?";"";"";

45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.
However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second? (re @Acura360: https://twitter.com/baboongasser/status/1022493386941648897?s=12)";"";"";
