```
How do I find a Counterparty for my atomic swap?
Liquality's cross-chain atomic swap Alpha interface does not have a discovery or matching mechanism. It is purely an execution and settlement interface for conducting atomic swaps, meant to eliminate counterparty risk and fees. Users should utilize their networks, communities, groups, and other means to find a counterparty and agree on a price before using Liquality's interface to execute and settle swaps.
