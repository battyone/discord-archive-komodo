It can be published using the Bitcoin blockchain through the Equihash-based PoW protocol. Notarization improves security while using zero-knowledge proof to provide 100% anonymous transactions. Cross-chain, through Komodo's joint multi-chain technology, all sub-chains are granted seamless cross-chain operation with the federal chain. Each sub-chain can also connect and collaborate with the broader blockchain industry by connecting non-federal chains through atomic exchange. It combines the anonymity of ZCash with the security of Bitcoin, while featuring innovative atomic cross-chain technology.

the base nodes are enough to launch your Smart Chain and be ready to grow the network
but they might not be able to tolerate the load of a lot of new nodes connecting to them at the same time
so, if you are expecting a sudden influx of new nodes (as it happens during a Public launch), adding additional nodes (2 to 3) is a good idea
once other nodes are started and become part of the network, the load on the nodes maintained by the Antara Composer should decrease significantly
