Wish you also good luck with Chainzilla and glad that you still will be around (re @PTYTrader: I am no longer with the team in the sense that I am focusing 100% on Chainzilla. I will support Komodo to all our capacities as service providers. I wouldn't say leaving, I would call it expanding horizons. Chainzilla gives me the ability to focus my energy on polishing the tech and bringing new blood into the ecosystem.)";"";"";

Hope you stay connected closely with Komodo)";"";"";
