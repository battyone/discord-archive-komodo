Agama was badly tested, and we will inform the community re: the changes we will introduce in our process. (re @xarux: Would you prefer another thief to steal your money before it decided to make another thief? Yes - the first thief ""after some time will return to you perhaps"" - but even if it is for good, it is still theft, even for good! Ethereum in its time hardfok grasped on such incidents! and what will we get now? Is the network infrastructure safe? Ok, the blockchain itself is good - but its infrastructure is well-known! It means that agama was badly tested - competing in the speed of releases instead of focusing on the security of the wallet! You have a dissonance that such a cool project happened? Me too! This is my favorite project - but now the big questions!)";"";"";
