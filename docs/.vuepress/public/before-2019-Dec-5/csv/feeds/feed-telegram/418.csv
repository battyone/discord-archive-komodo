(Btw personally I think the use case is very good but the whole thing is partly based on assumption that ethereum and projects / defi based on it will succeed also in future. Which to me is quite an assumption. Plus  quite bad tokenomics, still erc-20, evidence on organized pumps n dumps on it and so on.) Whatever back to my point which is once you get recognition the markets will react, in this case wildly. Now what is interesting to me is how hard it would be to develop such project based on Komodo? Certainly Komodo / Antara provides better tools for developing a project for such use case than ethereum...? Or gaming projects, would'nt Komodo be optimal platform to build projects? And so on.. Also the benefits like organising decentralised ico and get your project straight away to trade on AtomicDex... Very nice for starting a project. I think the key is to get the word out and by this way get devs to build real stuff with komodo. They just need to be made aware of the possibilities.";"";"";
