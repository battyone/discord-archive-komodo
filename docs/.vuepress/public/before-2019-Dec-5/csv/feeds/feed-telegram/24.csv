"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"21-Jun-18 07:59 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> mainly you get reimbursed the money back via Fiat, not crypto, and only if the fiat price is below the fiat ICO price ($0.20) which indicates they believe the entire crypto market will rise and if they accept in KMD they can likely get plenty in rewards just holding the funds in reserve (idk if this is what they are doing) but only the private sale purchases will work for the money back, so it's likely they are mostly accepting KMD via barterDEX right now. another thing is the funds are only 100% refundable after 3 years, and they must not move from your wallet in that entire time period. so you move the funds, or sell them w.e. then you can't get it back. so there's definitely some big requirements to be qualified for it. Idk if I'm really about the ""guarantee"" portion, it seems like the only way they can do that is to set aside and back the funds by $0.20 per coin with actual fiat. and regardless of the price they need to keep that $0.20 * presale number of coins.";"";"";
