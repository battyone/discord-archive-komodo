(re @Regnar: To put it simply. With 100 KMD, if you claim once a month, you'll get 99.9968% my theoretical max. If you claim once a week, its 99.6130%, if you claim daily though, its only 95.3702% the theoretical max! 
Not to say dont claim daily, because you may have to if you make transactions or receive some, buy more etc and they aren't over 10kmd utxo or dont have nlocktime set then you should claim them to set the rewards etc. But yea looks like monthly is best, weekly is a close second, daily is lagging.)";"";"";

I made a purchase for $20 and they debited my bank account on the same day. However, that initial purchase took over 10 business days to complete and that was after I got on their case about why the transaction was still pending. Then I found out that you cannot move your Komodo to your KMD wallet.  You can only move USD which means you have to sell your coins.   So I submitted a sell request 12 days ago which is still pending and no money has been deposited back to my account.  On top of this there is a $5 monthly fee.   Disappointed in the KMD team for recommending such garbage.  For others out there, don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. Stay clear of Cred";"";"";

So Plaid authenticates account data which makes ACH transfers easier/faster but pulls from your account (not plaid or CRED) are still processed by ACH. Which does take days (kinda why we're all in crypto) so no surprise on the wait time there, companies like Coinbase have insane amounts of USD and Crypto which they basically front you the amount for the days while the backend transactions are actually happening. CRED probably doesn't have that money yet.
I'm not sure what you mean move Komodo to KMD wallet, but I dont have the app. I dont know what they do with sell requests though. But 12 days seems like a lot. (re @OriginalBitcoin: Heads up to the KMD community.  I decided to try the CRED app after hearing on this chat that they were offering buy $10 KMD get $10 of KMD for free.  It has been a nightmare so far.  I made a purchase for $20 and they debited my bank account on the same day. However, that initial purchase took over 10 business days to complete and that was after I got on their case about why the transaction was still pending. Then I found out that you cannot move your Komodo to your KMD wallet.  You can only move USD which means you have to sell your coins.   So I submitted a sell request 12 days ago which is still pending and no money has been deposited back to my account.  On top of this there is a $5 monthly fee.
