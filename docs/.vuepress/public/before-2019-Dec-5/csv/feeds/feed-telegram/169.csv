It is certainly a bargain deal ;) currently Komodo is overhauling its brand and message and has brought on Ideas By Nature to facilitate this. You can check out their previous work on projects like Salt, Shapeshift, bitcoin,com, Coindesk, coincap,io and others. So we're very confident the new image will be great. 
Additionally jl777 and other devs have been developing crypto conditions contracts that can work cross chains and are language agnostic. The creation of them is the initial steps to show what can be done, and bring projects on board to build with them. 
Komodo is a decentralized project so most funds for things are crowdsourced or contributed from the lead developers own pockets, and I know there is a partnership announcement coming up, though I dont know how much marketing team is letting on before hand so I wont go beyond saying that (check out the discord channel for more info too).
There is also a lot of resources being built to help developers learn how to build on Komodo, and in various languages. It's pretty split apart right now (as is the nature of decentralized projects) but we are consolidating them for ease of use for developers. 
Here's the discord link, definitely can get lost in all the channels of cool stuff and 3rd party projects building on Komodo. You can also ask to have your project there too if youd like.
