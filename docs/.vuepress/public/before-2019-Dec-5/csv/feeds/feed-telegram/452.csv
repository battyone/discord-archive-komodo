But Komodo funds that were initially raised won't be used that way.
I'm personally not against listing fees (assuming they are reasonable) (re @klimenko85: Thanks. I thought so. I just need this information for further distribution.)";"";"";

But the ICO funds are allocated almost entirely to paying dPoW costs.";"";"";
