Komodo-Qt is not external GUI on komodod, it's Bitcoin Core Qt Interface + Komodo Daemon inside. So, it has updates from blockchain data same way as komodod. And GUI part is used for visualisation. It's not used ZMQ or any other interface to interact with ""daemon"", it has ""daemon inside"". So, Komodo-Qt = closed integration of GUI and komodod, same as bitcoind and Bitcoin Core GUI.";"";"";
