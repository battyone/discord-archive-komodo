@lukechilds#2707 is it possible to have marketmaker launch anyway even if one of the electrum servers isnt working? Because now it just keeps loading because of the vrsc electrum. I think most people dont look at dev console, so they wont know whats causing hyperdex to load forever
```

@Cryptoon it should do that already, there is something like a 5s timeout. If the electrum server doesn't respond in that time `marketmaker` should ignore it and move on. If mm is hanging on an electrum server then it sounds like there's a bug in mm. Unfortunately we can't tell it to stop from our end, we can't communicate with it until it's finished.

If you can reproduce the issue are you able to report it to mm devs?";"";"";

"419964976397156352";"cipi#4502";"17-Oct-18 06:07 AM";"i also observed two different situations
1. the method ""electrum"" returns with an error saying the server is unreachable, so does the console output
2. the method ""electrum"" says everything is fine, but console says node is dead
on CLI this does not seem to make any difference, but i can imagine GUIs are relying on the info that mm returns (not the output in console)
i don't know where the difference between this 2 fails is... could be the difference is that one tcp connection returns ""Connection refused"" immediately and the other case is where Firewalls do their part and the connection attempt doesn't return anything, it is simply stuck... that may also cause the large delays when starting mm... it makes a difference if a connection attempt is refused immediately or if mm waits for the OS timeout... could be a good idea to try to cover this in the code by playing with the timeout-options, but i fear i don't have the knowledge to be able to tell this for sure";"";"";
