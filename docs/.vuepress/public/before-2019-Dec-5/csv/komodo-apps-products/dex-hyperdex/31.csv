I'm aware of the withdrawal issue, it appears to be either a mm or possibly Electrum issue. Other users have reported the same issue using the mm daemon directly. To be clear, HyperDEX is just a GUI layer on top of mm. If mm responds responds saying the withdrawal was successful then the GUI (HyperDEX) will display a notification saying the withdrawal is successful, that is functioning as expected.

We are aware of performance issues with mm and have been reporting them since we started developing HyperDEX. mm and HyperDEX are developed by two separate development teams. We have reported perf issues to the mm team and they are working on mmv2 which will hopefully address these issues.

Regarding the interface not being clear, are you referring to the actual visual design or the way it works? Any feedback you've got here or issues you encounter would definitely be appreciated. Feel free to discuss them in here. However if you have specific issue/suggestion/bug it may be best to create a GitHub issue with the ""Feedback"" button in the app so we can track it make sure we get the issue resolved.";"";"";

"382325303269392385";"stock999#4818";"28-Dec-18 12:19 AM";"I don't understand  ' Avg Vol', 'Max Vol', etc.  I newer  used to work with such kind of exchange, atomic swap. That's why i need a detailed guide.";"";"";
"429101104480124929";"jspook16#3059";"28-Dec-18 05:15 AM";"so currently volume is low for most pairs because not enough people are using it. ""This swap is worth $.."" should be an estimate of what the swap is worth in fiat. So if you trade 10 kmd for X number of Verus (example) it should say this swap is worth ~ $7. Im going off memory. I think avg vol is the avg vol of available utxos. Max vol i think is the largest utxo. Atomic swaps basically swap one utxo size for another of equal value. Hyperdex helps in creating a utxo for the size you are trying to swap for. What pairs are you looking to trade? @stock999";"";"";

"429101104480124929";"jspook16#3059";"28-Dec-18 05:21 AM";"@stock999 also as an fyi, currently barterdex is running marketmaker 1.0 (think of it as the brains that allow for atomic swaps). There is an upgrade early next year to mm2.0 (marketmaker 2.0) that should make things alot smoother. AND there is a project (coincollect) that is working on a mobile trading app with barterdex backend. The project is also advertising providing liquidity to jump start the app use. tagging @Diesmaster to make sure i captured coincollect project correctly.";"";"";

"382325303269392385";"stock999#4818";"28-Dec-18 11:38 AM";"It is still not clear about utxo.   What happens if i have no a proper size? For example, i have received 100 KMD  as a one single tx,  i.e . utxo is 100, right? But i want to sell only 10 or 20 of them. Will it work?";"";"";
