Like how I didn't think of it before, liquidity can be huge, but only if people are actively on it, and people who are only on it to trade won't be on it for long, or long enough to find buyers/sellers. So, add a feature that gets people to stay on it longer (for fun, company, or to find traders)";"";"üëç (2)";
