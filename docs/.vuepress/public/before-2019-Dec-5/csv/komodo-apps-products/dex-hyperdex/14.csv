I always yuse the same address then sent a heap of 10 KMD to it... over time the transactions cause change UTXO's to fill up the wallet... occasionally they get a bit small, sou you need to withdraw some KMD back to your own address to consolidate some of them. This way there is always lots of dust UTXO to use for the Alice Dex fee aswell. No nede to worry about splitting UTXO's and all that stuff.";"";"";
