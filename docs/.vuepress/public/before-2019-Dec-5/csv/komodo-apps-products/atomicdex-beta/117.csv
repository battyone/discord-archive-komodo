we have ETH/erc20 and btc protocol (btc forks, zcash and its forks and komodo and its smart chains) swaps already implemented
so adding one of those is just adding their details to a file and doing a test swap

for new protocols, it is a completely different story
we need to get in touch with their developers and code their swap entirely from scratch. So, it depends";"";"";
