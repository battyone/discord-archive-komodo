Everywhere else, you'd need an account to make your funds go ""poof"" for anyone who's watching you; on any kmdex, you'll just swap via arrr and off to wherever it was you where going and you're off the grid. So that would be the adoption booster in the arrr case, not so much the fees. And of course, then there the multiple use of funds you mention. 😃";"";"";
