I participated in the stress test, not expecting to win anything, just hoping, and hoping to help improve this software.

Native Web-based Dex

Plus other projects which will create their own GUI (e.g. HyperDex/Chainswap) and use Dex as engine - plus the potential when MM2 is ready incl. Z Address Handling (Pirate) + CEX Orderbook Connection

And not to forget the integration of Dex into existing wallet providers.

Everyone uses one and the same order book.
And you earn money with every trade.
