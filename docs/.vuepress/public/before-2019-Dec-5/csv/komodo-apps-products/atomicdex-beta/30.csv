First off, really great job! This is going to be awesome when it's done. VERY easy to navigate and to use. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with in terms of improvements. Here's my set of suggestions.

1) sending coins from coinbase/binance  (PC) to the dex involves actually having to type the address out. This can be a nuisance /liability . So a good addition would be to let the app scan the text or a qr code
2) this might be phone specific, but if you can have the address displayed in one line as opposed to the last few characters on the next line, it might be more convenient for users.
3) if I need to leave the app for some reason while I'm about to enter the amt for the swap, when I get back in, the selections and the numbers are gone. So if you can retain those number while the app gets locked, that would be awesome. 
4)It would be nice if you could explicitly explain what the kmd reward is somewhere in the app
5) same as above for the gas needed for transactions
6) I'm not sure if this was by design, but my Rick and morty addresses were the same. I got my rick coins. And when I tried to put the address in morty faucet provided in the email. It mentioned that it was sent to the address. But it never showed up.

Tests in the email 
1) the Rick and morty swap executed perfectly.
2) I tried to swap some the kmd for eth. I got a msg saying ""base coin balance is too low to cover gas fee. Need 0.0002"" what does this mean? I need to have some eth to be able to swap kmd with eth? I got that same msg when I tried to swap kmd with usdc as per the email.

Hope this helps! Great job guys! It was awesome to be a part of this";"";"";

For now it seems that there is some specific connectivity problem to electrums and more logs after failed swap will help to isolate it.
  
@ubhillutd thak you for a feedback!  advices are great, nice idea to show information message/popup that ETH is needed when in ERC20/ETH part of the swap";"";"";
