I have done swapping some Ricks and Mortys and wanted to try the real deal - sent LTC from Coinbase to AtomicDEX, which went instantly. Here are some observations:
* after the screen locks while being in DEX tab, all the information (coin, amount) resets to blank - I believe it should keep that information after unlocking screen
* the same happens, if I put information in DEX and then switch to Orders or History sub-tab - after coming back to Trade sub-tab, all the fields are blank again
* I like that fiat equivalent is shown, but I would also like to swap coins based on exchange rate (at least informational calculated values shown), not based only on amount
* is it true - if someone has made a market order, I have only two options - either accept the exchange rate or deny it? Is there no option to make market order myself if someone has already done that? 
* What happens with partial orders - for example I want to swap 0.1 BTC to 800 KMD but in the market there is only 400 KMD available for swap?";"";"üëç (1)";
