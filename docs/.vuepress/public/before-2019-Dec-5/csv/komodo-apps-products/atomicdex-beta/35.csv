I've managed to figure out how to launch an electrum coin, by copying the LTCconnect.sh and replacing the neccesary info to launch, say, RICK, but where can I find the info for launching DOGE, or RFOX for example? I can get RPCports from the coins file, but what about URLs?";"";"";

Now I'm super curious about the seed words used in atomicDEX. Is it strictly BIP39? Or is it using a modified list of words that excludes words like ""you""?

Or perhaps there was another hint tucked away that indicated one should ignore that BIP word...?";"";"";
