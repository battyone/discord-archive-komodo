On android, the app can run in the background to complete the swap. Depends on your phone's power saving settings (wifi/4g keep alive while screen is off), background data usage settings etc etc ) 
On iOS you have to have the app open and the screen on at all times until the swap is finished. 

If the app is closed, or screen is locked, or network connection terminated, and the swap has already started (fee was sent), you can open the app again in a few minutes, to kickstart the swap before it fails (timeouts). If this does not happen, it will fail, and refund will be given in 4 hours.";"";"üëç (1),‚úÖ (1)";
