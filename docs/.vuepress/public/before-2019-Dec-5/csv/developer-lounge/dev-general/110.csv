one of those basics of KMD is to be able to create your own chain.

- ""you"" being a dev, and you can create an application specific chain and secure it to bitcoin hashrate.

or

-  you being a dev and your application wants to create a chain for ""your user"", so essentially your application will run a cluster of 10k chains.  Verus Coin project is doing something like this with public blockchains as a service for polls.  Each poll is just a short lived chain, maybe a day, maybe a week.

The notary network does the notarizations, but in the #kmdlabs they are making their own notary network that still does the YOURCHAIN->KMD notarization, but they'll be incentivizing their channel and their own notaries by other means.

There's nothing to stop in say 1000 days, 50 other notary networks being created.   If you have an application that requires 1 chain per user, maybe you'll have a partner network of B2B that can integrate related services and between your partner network, you're all incentivized to notarize (keep a healthy network) for different methods of rewards for maintaining a healthy ecosystem of your own.";"";"";

"371114647052615681";"Mylo#8306";"30-Jan-19 01:54 AM";"That's the security aspect 👆 


Now for scalability.   Instead of your application making 1 chain per user, it needs maximum throughput, of say 10k actions per second.   Then to achieve this, your application would run a cluster of chains, approx 100.   These 100 chains can interact with each other, through KMD's crypto conditions tech and act as one chain.  All your cluster will notarize to KMD and be able to interrogate KMD for past notarizations.  This interrogation is handled efficiently using a MoMoM (merkle root of merkle root of merkle root).  In your cluster, you want to maintain coin/token/etc. supply, so combined with MoMoM is a burn protocol, so within your cluster it's always got same balance.";"";"";

If you wanted to make a  very ridiculousconsensus rule that a transaction needed human authorization e.g. by making a pop up saying ""click me"", and if the user clicks it's authorized and tx passes validity - or if it's not clicked, then the tx is rejected, then that is part of the consensus code, that silly pop up is now blockchain verifiable that someone clicked it.

More sensible uses are for time locked block rewards being paid when timelock expires to a group of ppl, like pool miners in a share system, or some other off-chain system that is oraclized, like how many goals were scored on playstation in the last 5 mins to those goal scorers.";"";"";
