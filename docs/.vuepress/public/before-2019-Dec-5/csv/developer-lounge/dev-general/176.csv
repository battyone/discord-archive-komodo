Simple scripts to create a Komodo assetchain using a single node for testing, inntalls **explorer** too if needed
Instructions:

- This repository automates the steps described in the doc: docs.komodoplatform.com/assetchains/create-asset-chain-single-node.html
- Assumes Ubuntu desktop environment, may need tweaks for other environments

Clone the repository and navigate into it.

Step 1:
Create a file named data and add the following contents:
```
name=<ASSETCHAIN-NAME>
srcdir=/home/<USER>/komodo/src
launch=""komodod -ac_name=$name -ac_supply=10""
datadir=/home/<USER>/coinData
```
- name is the assetchain's desired name
- srcdir is the absolute location of the directory which contains komodod and komodo-cli
- launch is the custom launch parameters of the assetchain, don't include -pubkey or -addnode
- datadir is the directory to which the datadirectories of the second daemons are saved, no need to create it, the script will do it for you
Step 2
Create a file named keys and add the following contents:
```
pubkey1=02xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
pubkey2=03xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
privkey1=Uxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
privkey2=Uxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
- pubkey1 and privkey1 are a pair of keys used to launch the first daemon
- pubkey2 and privkey2 are a pair of keys used to launch the second daemon

Step 3

```
