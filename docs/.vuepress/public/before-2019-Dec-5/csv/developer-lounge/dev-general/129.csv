- able to get the state of gotty process from my go code, which I can now manage to direct actions and events based on it's state. The state is that once game ends, it closes the temporary http server created for it's web session via gotty. I had trouble getting the state of it's end process from gotty, which is now solved. just needed to keep trying and looking for different angle to get to point where I got now.
- Also learned to manage websockets via go using 3rd party go package gorilla, which is recommended by official go language as a reference until the official go websockets library complets. tested websockets with my rogue tty test code which works as I expect it to work.
- Now working on to the channels part. To direct the state of the game end to websockets at backend code written in go, which will pass that info to web html which can then take further action.";"";"üí™ (3)";

Thank you, these fixes were great.

I've gone through and added a few additional grammar clarifications.
