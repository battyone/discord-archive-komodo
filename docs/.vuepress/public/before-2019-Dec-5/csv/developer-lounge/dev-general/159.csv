https://rainbownet.work/RainbowNetwork.pdf

`This paper presents the Rainbow Network,  a design for an off-chain non-custodial exchange and payment network supporting any liquid asset. The Rainbow Network allows a user to trade, lend, borrow, send, and receive any liquid asset, entirely off-chain, while having only one on-chain payment channel collateralized by a single asset. The network is composed of Rainbow channels, a  variant of payment channels where settlement balances are computed based on the current prices of other assets. This paper presents two constructions of Rainbow channels:  one where the parties to each channel agree on a price oracle, and a more limited versionthat does not require a trusted price oracle. The latter construction can be implemented on top of any bidirectional payment channel, such as the Bitcoin payment channels used in the Lightning Network`";"";"";
