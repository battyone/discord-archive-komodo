Hi Tony, I spent some time today working over the documentation for Gateways. If I recall correctly, I believe you are the dev expert on this cc module?

If so, can you please look through this documentation and review?

I did as much as I could today to ensure accuracy, but I am certain there are still several mistakes.

The easiest way to handle revisions is if you would please make a fork of the repo to your repository, make any changes you want locally by just writing right over the top wherever you need, and then when you are done, submit all revisions as a single pull request.
