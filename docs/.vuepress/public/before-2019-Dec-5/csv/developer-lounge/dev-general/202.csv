XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.

For AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML:

Using XML

    Fetch an XML document
    Use the XML DOM to loop through the document
    Extract values and store in variables

Using JSON

    Fetch a JSON string
    JSON.Parse the JSON string```

I made some initial queries with JSON schemas standardization and parsers, there are two aiming for acceptance as RFC but they offer the implementation with it.

This is a problem because KMD codebase already has 2 JSON parsers, the btc one and one in C for The cryptocondition stuff.

I‚Äôm looking for use cases to interconnect systems.  Currently my best two finds are landxml which is a huge system of data used by surveyors, civil & other engineers, architects and government.  Supported by high tech engineering tools as well as autocad, autodesk etc.

The other is Shopify products and orders.

A third is booking.com and the entire travel industry.

I really want an ‚Äúeasy‚Äù integration example, not so much of a learn a whole discipline to extract a small part of data.

XML standards offer many implementations into legacy systems, payroll, education etc.   JSON little interoperability amongst disparate systems.

It‚Äôs for a CClib example with oracles at the end of the day.  Possibly tokens.  I want to be able to show new levels of interoperability.
