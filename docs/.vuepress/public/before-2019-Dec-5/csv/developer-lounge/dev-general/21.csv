""
Also, here in getblocksubsidy, I see a section about a founder's reward.

This sounds like something leftover from the Zcash team?

getblocksubsidy
---------------

::

  getblocksubsidy height_number

The ``getblocksubsidy`` method returns the block-subsidy reward. The resulting calculation takes into account the mining slow start and the founders reward, of block at index provided.


How would we change this for KMD? Is there anything we'd need to indicate about how our rewards are calculated -- perhaps the 5% reward?";"";"";

I'm assuming the needs thing was put there by accident?

Also, in the response I receive, I see that inside the miners array there are 64 objects for notary nodes, and then one additional object that has 
{
        ""pubkey"": ""external miners"",
        ""blocks"": 541
}

Can you tell me about this object?

Also, in the notary node objects, I see that there's a blocks property as well. I believe these properties are related? Can you tell me about this as well?
