like CC library, it would be nice to have vue-components (or react) that can work with KMD ecosystem to expedite front end PoC.

Here is info on vuepress https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#life-cycle

@grewalsatinder thanks for that vue component.  might be useful in docs.  i'm experimenting with vuepress to include vue components (and including using the komodo-rpc-lib wrapper).  there is an equihash-verify library, if my testing works out might have to make a need-to-have list and nice-to-have list";"";"👍 (2)";
