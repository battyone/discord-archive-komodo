The current codebase is integrated into the komodod codebase, which is C/C++. However, it is possible to use different languages and integrate into the C/C++ as zcash has shown by using the rust language for some parts of the zcashd.

I think any language that is compiled and can create a linkable library while being able to call and be called by C/C++ functions can be used. If you are able to make such a language binding for a simple CC contract like faucet, this will be good for a 777 KMD bounty. Of course, you need to be the first to submit a properly working pull request.
