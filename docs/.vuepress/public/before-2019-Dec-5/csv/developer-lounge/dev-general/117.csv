Think of channels CC as a gift card for some store. You top up the card with funds (open a channel to Bob which will add funds to that channel on a 1of2 address), and then you use the card for paying (make a payment to Bob - releasing funds from channels address to Bob). And it is instant, no need to wait for confirmations/notarizations for a payment, as when opening channel with funds that tx needs to be notarized and from that point Bob is sure that he will get the funds as soon payment is made (gets in mempool).";"";"üëå (1)";
