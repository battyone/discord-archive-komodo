I'll be gettting back in touch with you about this, sometime this week.

Thanks for pointing this out.

It will be good to keep an eye on it.

Came across this ``segmentation fault`` regtest chain crash again.

I've been going down the list of commands, one by one, just polishing the docs.

regtest chain ran for at least 24 hours.

I shut it down with `stop`, so I could reload with the `-exportdir` option enabled for a command I was working on, and when I restarted I got this response:

```
$ ./komodod -ac_name=SIDDT -addressindex=1 -exportdir=""/home/siddhartha/Desktop/"" -regtest

estimatepriority nblocks
------------------------

The ``estimatepriority`` method estimates the approximate priority of a zero-fee transaction, when it needs to begin confirmation within ``nblocks`` blocks.

Arguments:

::

    nblocks     (numeric)      a statement indicating within how many blocks the transaction should be confirmed

Response:

::

    n    (numeric) estimated priority

  -1.0 is returned if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate.
