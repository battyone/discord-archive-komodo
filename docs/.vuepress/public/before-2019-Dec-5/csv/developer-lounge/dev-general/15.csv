Coin Daemon Maintenance and Parameters
======================================

<==Gcharang: we need to add this section above in the index ==>

Manually deleting blockchain data
---------------------------------
Sometimes it is necessary to manually delete all blockchain data. This will trigger a full resync of the blockchain.

Users should exercise caution not to delete the ``wallet.dat`` file during this procedure. We recommend that the user make frequent backups of the ``wallet.dat`` file, especially before deleting files from the application directory.

The following files should be deleted:

::
  ``blocks``
  ``chainstate``
  ``notarisations``
  ``komodostate``
  ``komodostate.ind``

Default file locations:
::
    MacOS: ``~/Library/Application Support/Komodo``
    GNU/Linux: ``~/.komodo``
    Windows: <<==need this==>

-addressindex
-------------
The ``addressindex`` is a parameter that is executed at run time. The command instructs a KMD-based coin daemon to make a full index of all addresses and balances. It is commonly used in web-based blockchain explorers for rapid search across the entire blockchain history.

When utilizing this command the synced blockchain data should be deleted to allow for a full resync. The user may need to manually delete the blockchain data before executing the command <==link to manual deletion instructions above==>.

The ``-reindex`` command is not a viable alternative method for resyncing the blockchain.

Usage:

To initiate the ``addressindex`` command at runtime, include ``-addressindex=1`` as a parameter.

::

  ``./komodod -addressindex=1``

To set the ``addressindex`` feature as a default parameter, include the parameter in the ``komodo.conf`` configuration file.
