This might also be a good feature for starting up Agama or BarterDEX (Start up by auto loading all coins with a balance). I think in the future we could see more AC startups and performing Airdrops, and its possible people don't realize they have these coins from the airdrops because they never heard of it, or just weren't paying attention, so they wouldn't activate the wallet. 

I also understand that technically all these addresses would be using different blockchains which adds more complexity to it, but I'm not sure on how much more complex this would be to view AC addresses too.";"";"";

It was easy to create a new asset chain using the following configuration:

`./komodod -pubkey=<pubkey> -ac_name=<myCoin> -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=0 -ac_end=0 -addnode=<ipOfNode>  &`

But there's still one problem I cannot solve: With this configuration miners still get `0.00010000` mining reward, and the total amount of coins is growing.
