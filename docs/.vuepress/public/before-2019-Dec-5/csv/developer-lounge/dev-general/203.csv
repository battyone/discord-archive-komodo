Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have 😄 Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).";"";"";
