Can you help with this?

The curl commands that are in our docs had an upstream bug in them. They were not properly escaped. 

This caused issues back in August/September and later, while I was trying to write Komodo API and other preliminary docs. 

Dukeleto went and fixed this upstream bug. 😃 Good man.

We can now more easily generate curl commands for each rpc. 

Would you mind adding this to your to-do list?

curl commands are very useful for GUI developers and others integrating Komodo software.";"";"";
