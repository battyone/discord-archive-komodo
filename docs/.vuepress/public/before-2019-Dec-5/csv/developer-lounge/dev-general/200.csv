Yes I use the math.Pow() from go to get same result. Since the 2, 256 is long answer it gives big int, and others are short so those are returned as either float64 or int, so I am not getting correct subtraction value. Just figuring out that in go now.

CDP offers big benefits for base token holders. Holders are not forced to sell their tokens. They can create over collateralized stable coins. This way the can avoid temporary liquidity crisis, use the token to pay for bills without selling the token itself, which could trigger tax event.
They can even buy more base token with stable coin, thus using it as small leverage to increase buy pressure.
