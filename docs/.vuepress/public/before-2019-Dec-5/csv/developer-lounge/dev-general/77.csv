- This morning I could have claimed the rewards for this UTXO

Though, I emptied the UTXO by doing a 100% UTXO value `sendtransaction`. Therefor I cannot claim the reward for this UTXO anymore.

__

Lessons learned:

1. (It's only possible to claim rewards for UTXO's with > 10 KMD value)
2. Make sure you always claim rewards before you do transactions that split UTXO's with rewards to UTXO's having less then 10 KMD of value";"";"";

A decentralized + transparent bank: (Looks like a classical, but please read on.)

-
The main point is transparency. 
All transactions of ""public"" accounts are visible by everyone or at least related communities. 

-
There are many use cases. 
Charity organizations, foundations, local governments, societies, associations, artists, authors, singers, projects, software developers*, software projects*, ...
can open accounts on this platform.

If I donate sth to a local foundation or society etc, I can see if they are using money as they promised.

I listen a song on youtube, read a book on the web, use on open source software. 
But nto easy to send money for support.

Transparency is default but configurable. 
Accounts can be public or anonym.
Transfers also can be public or anonym.";"";"";

A 1 level more detail:

-Ids:   
    Individuals, Identities. Real People.
    ::Name Surname Nationality National Id Number, Profile Picture, BirthDate, Phone, Email, Password related info
    Identities can be verified by a hierarchical +p2p (friends) notary/verification model. 

-Non Person (Collectives, Joints, ..)
    Companies, Foundations, Funds*, ...
    ::Country, CompanyId, Name, ..
    Shareholders, Participants {id, numberOfShares, entryTxId}

-Accounts
    Will store curencies.
    ::OwnerId, AccountId, Currency, Balance, Name, Type (Public, Private)
    
    -Transactions:   
        From Account, To Account, When, TxId, Explanation, Amount
        Transactions can be public, private also

-Transfers
    A sends amount X to B with explanation E. (can choose public, private)

-Deposit, Withdrawal
    Like sending receiving cryptocurrencies to / from exchanges

-Exchange
    barterDex

-Credits
    (Simple Credit:)
    A sends Amnt to B as credit offer. 
    A sets an expiry duration for the offer (lets say 10 minutes or 2 hours..). The amount is blocked.
    If B accepts, blocked amount sent to B s account. If rejects or at expiry time, money goes back to A.
    ..
    B can partially or completely close this credit by paying back amount.


Of course not this simple, these are minimals. 
(I have 15-20 years of banking IT experience. Systems are basically as above.)

Let me know how the new documentation works for you.

This is the same documentation that you see on `komodoplatform.com/developer-docs/`. The latter link has temporary url masking on it, so you can't copy/paste links as easily yet. I'm working on fixing that right now.
