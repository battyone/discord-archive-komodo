Author: Jack Grigg <jack@z.cash>
Date:   Thu May 11 18:00:15 2017

    Add a benchmark for calling ConnectBlock on a block with many inputs

    Requires placing block-107134.tar.gz (containing the block, and a fake CoinsDB
    containing its inputs) into the base directory of the repository. This can be
    generated using qa/zcash/create_benchmark_archive.py (see the script for usage
    details).

    To facilitate generation of the fake CoinsDB, an additional field 'valueZat' has
    been added to 'getrawtransaction' containing the integer number of zatoshis
    instead of a decimal number of ZEC.```";"";"";
