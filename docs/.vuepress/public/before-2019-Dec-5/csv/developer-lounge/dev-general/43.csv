Remember that discussion we had about pukey's, and my initial confusion? How I previously thought pubkeys were for donating to the block chain's creator?

I found the parameter that I was confusing it with. I think Zcash uses this or something for their developer's reward.

## donation

> Using donation as a default value in the coin's .conf file:

```
donation=027dc7b5cfb5efca96674b45e9fda18df069d040b9fd9ff32c35df56005e330392

This is why bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer balks at the idea of calling Bisq a DEX at all. He told CoinDesk he sees Bisq as more of a peer-to-peer, over-the-counter trading desk.

""Exchanges that don't have [order books] can't really help with price discovery, and are open to all kinds of manipulation,"" Wertheimer said. ""So they can't really be considered exchanges in the same way that the incumbents are.""

```
can you guys please recommend me a key/value database to use with go langauge? don't wish to use leveldb. like RethinkDB, but it needs to install and run the daemon on the system. Wants something portable as sqlite db.
any recommendations/suggestions?

SQLite actually has and always had a KV module, btree.h, and I was crazy enough to use it back when it was undocumented and use-at-your-own-risk thing (now it's a bit more official, https://www.sqlite.org/btreemodule.html)";"";"🆒 (1)";

I think I've tried all the major players in the field, mostly because most of them had serious downsides. E.g. Tokyo Cabinet suffers from fragmentation, Berkeley DB is kind of slow, GDBM slows down when it grows, DBF needs vacuuming, LevelDB and RocksDB can only be accessed from a single process.";"";"";

I've always liked the SQLite interfaces, both KV and SQL. You can shoot yourself in the foot with them, but the thing is more flexible than the other databases. But until recently it had a crappy write speed.

New versions though has upped their game and in the WAL mode SQLite is now a serious contender to LMDB and LevelDB/RocksDB.";"";"";
