Upon submission of a proof to the submit-event-proof function, the event is tentatively accepted for a contestation period of k blocks, during which any other party, the contester , can provide a counter-proof showing that the original proof was fraudulent. The contester can call the submit- contesting-proof function passing it the contesting proof œÄ ‚àó and the event predicate e . The function runs the NIPoPoW verify algorithm to compare the original proof events [ e ] . proof against the contesting proof œÄ ‚àó . If the verification algorithm concludes that the original proof was fraudulent, the tentatively accepted event is abandoned and the collateral is paid to the contester
