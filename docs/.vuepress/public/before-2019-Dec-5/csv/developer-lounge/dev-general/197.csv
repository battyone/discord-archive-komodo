Using jl777/komodo beta branch, I launch one kmd instance without issue with one user
I create a new user, I compiled again kmd, download a bootstrap and launch it with default komodo.conf
I realized that I forgot to change the rpcport (there is already one instance of kmd running on the default rpcport launched by the first user) : the error displayed is correct but there is a technical error at the end:
```Error: Unable to start HTTP server. See debug log for details.
komodod: scheduler.cpp:45: CScheduler::~CScheduler(): Assertion `nThreadsServicingQueue == 0' failed.```";"";"";

```bind=127.0.0.1:7772
rpcport=12345

7770 and 7771 are already used by the first instance";"";"";
