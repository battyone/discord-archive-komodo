Of course, some will revert to the hostile ways and not contribute anything at all, but so far we are seeing the vast majority of projects helping each other out as they can. The spirit of cooperation the KMD ecosystem has is quite a wonderful thing and of course without it, it wouldnt be a thriving ecosystem, but rather a scorched earth battlefield that we see in many parts of crypto";"";"";
