First one is that EBS volume can be mounted only to EC2 instances in the same region and AZ. Which can cause us some problems if the cluster is spread across 2 zones. The other limitation is that AWSElasticBlockStore can mount volume  with read/write permissionsonly to one ec2 instance. See the table in Access Mode chapter: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes";"";"";
