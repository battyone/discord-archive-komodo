After more than 4 months of trying to have BAY listed on the OEX exchange, we have had to concede to the fact that they have stolen our listing fee and will not be listing us. 
We have tried many times to get an exact date of listing and each time there has been a delay with various excuses.
Knowing we have had 3 BTC stolen which could have been spent on marketing or put towards another exchange listing is very frustrating. We will look into legal options to try and recover the fees, as long as it isn’t too expensive of course.
