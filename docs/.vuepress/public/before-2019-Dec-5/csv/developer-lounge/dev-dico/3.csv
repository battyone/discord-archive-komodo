Unfortunately neither of them is Bitcoin-based, so I think they will need to wait for mm2.0 and a custom integration.";"";"";

One of the dICO selling points was a wider distribution because whales can't buy most tokens at once. I think having data to back this claim would be very useful";"";"";

Here's the Github repo: https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e I could help if there're questions for customizing or rewriting to mm2";"";"";

Where it was a technical ""thing"" in mm1 it can also be restrictive in mm2 with a flag set of ""max per swap per pubkey"".

Slightly different mechanism to perform resistance.  Can be gamed if a whale wanted to participate with 1000 instances perhaps.

@KomodoWorld I think you asked a cpl weeks ago";"";"";

I want to support komodo/the community so if it's possible to do (not really decentralized), would anyone be willing to give a quote? 
Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have üòÑ Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).";"";"üëç (1)";
