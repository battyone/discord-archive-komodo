The coin at the top is the coin that can be bought. Right now the balance of the offered coin is 0. What do I have to do to have a balance here?

I think the answer is something like this:

- Make sure that the electrum server `electrum1.cipig.net` can find liquidity for coin 'X'. As soon as there's liquidity, the amount of tokens for 'X' goes from 0 to a higher amount. From that moment it's possible to buy available tokens via BTC/KMD using the dICO-app.

Is my assumption above correct?";"";"";
