That's not even a question at this point, imo
From my perspective, the **main** thing is to ensure that the actions of a 3rd party (specifically @Magnum Wallet *in this instance*) do not get conflated with the action of someone in this ecosystem using that 3rd party (specifically @PTYX  *in this instance*).
