"283395529449406464";"TwilightPunkster K64#7533";"12-Mar-19 06:07 AM";"Now, what if we create a whole chain that is pragmatic, intuitive, for the people by the people that is an end-to-end solution.";"";"";
"283395529449406464";"TwilightPunkster K64#7533";"12-Mar-19 06:19 AM";"So for starters, Team Komodo provided me with some resources to make an infinite amount of royalty free games (thanks @Team  Admin). As you probably have noticed, I can make games, and so can others. What needs to be in place are turnkey solutions - plugins and tutorials to onboard people to create content. 

Now, who have noticed, I did manage to create a bare bones Unity plugin with ease, and a little logical layer on top of that. However, before that is properly ""usable"", that will take at least some days of my dedicated time, probably some weeks to actually create decent tutorials for it. However, this missing link can be a driver, as it is one of the most popular engines for indie game developers.

Eventually games need to be published somewhere so players can find them and purchase them (either through single fee or monthly subscription), which could be bought either through KMD and maybe support other coins that are ""powered by Komodo"". Not just games, but related can be tools - like Itch.io

All this stuff is easy, but it will cost time, resources like money and hardware. I am willing to pitch in where I can but remember I am (partially) human, so I can do only so much.";"";"üî• (4)";

That kinda sucks, There are plenty of Linux users out there, who'd love games. So I'd definitely would vouch for a ""build"" pipeline that makes life easier. But that would take at least 2 grand at bare minimum, and trust me, you don't want bare minimum.";"";"üëå (1),‚ù§ (1)";

Either you get stuck with DIY or vendorlocking cloud services. Either way, to support a huge amount of players, bet on burning 5K at least just to fire shit up.
