have somebody send funds, click refresh
then can send funds. basically onboarded pretty much instantly";"";"";

need error pages for: incorrect send, incorrect broadcast and non-valid wif to login with.
maybe a single error page where i can just display some text, or can even be three different error pages, whichever is easier

also on the wallet page, a new row below the coin/balance/address that has a mempool section. so a button like ""Update"" which would send the mempool query and then it would show a list of txids for any incoming funds. this will also catch sends if there was any change, so only tx that are sent but have not change will not appear. it seems a good compromise. maybe it will be like the txid history in how it is displayed";"";"";
