this will indeed never happen, but it doesn't have to do with the fee. you have to see it as the difference between `maker` and `taker` orders. `setprice` makes orders and puts them in the orderbook as a result, for `buy` and `sell` commands to take.

`I created some orders with atomicdex on my phones but I have no clues if it creates maker or taker orders` - AFAIK AtomicDEX GUI typically uses buy or sell methods, which create the taker order first, but if it's not matched it is then recreated as maker's and stays in orderbook until matched or cancelled.
