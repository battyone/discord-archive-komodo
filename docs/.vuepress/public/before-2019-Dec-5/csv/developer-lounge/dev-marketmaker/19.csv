It sounds like this aspect is similar to the Bitcoin P2P protocol, but in this case MM2 is trying to find some node who holds the order book.

We won't be able to get rid of ""relayers"" concept completely as direct communication between nodes is not always possible due to particular networking conditions.";"";"";

Since you're using the DHT instead of direct P2P, is it like maker and taker MM2s both publish messages using their private keys to the DHT, and they both just subscribe to the opposite's updates in the DHT? That sounds reasonable, and trading partners would only connect directly to seed nodes or DHT nodes, never to each other.";"";"";

`both publish messages using their private keys to the DHT, and they both just subscribe to the opposite's updates in the DHT?` - yes
`Are the IPs of the seed nodes shared like Bitcoin's addrman database, so all MM2s eventually learn of all the seed nodes?` - as of now MM2 uses hardcoded list of seednode IPs, the plan is to add automatic seednode discovery possibly via DHT.
`Do seed nodes each hold their own order book, or do seed nodes share one synchronized order book database?` - as of now seednodes receive the order messages like standard nodes and broadcast them to other connected clients. Every node (seed and non-seed) actually holds it's own orderbook collected from such messages and sometimes it might be out of sync.
`Are the order books published to the DHT?` - no, and maybe we won't use DHT at all for this purpose. We're considering several options for P2P orderbook exchange improvement, mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373";"";"";
