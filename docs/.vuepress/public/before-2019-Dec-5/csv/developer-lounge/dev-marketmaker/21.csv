Please check the most recent change in MM2: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/pull/126/files. The `rational` number type is added for ordermatching and it's highly recommended to support it as fast as possible. It's backwards-compatible with previous versions, but should solve the issues with numbers like `1/3` which can't be represented as finite decimal. So from now you may create an order with exactly `4/3` price and receive 3 RICK for your 4 MORTY. Please pay attention that `buy`, `sell`, `setprice` will stop accepting decimal numbers soon in requests, but will always display the decimal amounts in responses for readability. I've also left a note regarding the JSON representation used by `num-rational` crate. If you have any questions please let me know.";"";"üëç (2),üíØ (1)";
