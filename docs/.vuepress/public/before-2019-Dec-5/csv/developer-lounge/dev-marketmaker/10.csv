1. Is there a method which will return all trading activity across the network or is that only possible per node?  
2. The ticker method returns trades for the past 24 hours but only for a specific base/rel pair. . . although the doc states that it the base/rel pair is optional but it appears that LP_ticker is always passed base and rel arguments: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_stats.c#L811.

Hi, as I can see `statsdisp` method matches your requirements (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_commands.c#L422), as you can see the `ticker` method is just a wrapper for  `LP_statslog_disp` with specific hardcoded params. `statsdisp` allows you to get stats for all coins and specific timeframe. As I can see these stats will be displayed for whole network, but you need your node running permanently to collect the stats.";"";"";
