`The setprice order is always considered a sell, for internal implementation convenience.`

https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#sell
```Buy and sell methods always create the taker order first. Therefore, you must pay an additional 1/777 fee of the trade amount during the swap when taking liquidity from market. If your order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a maker request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the setprice method.

MM2 relies on rustls and webpki libraries that goal is to enforce good practices of SSL/TLS so it currently support TLS1.2-1.3 only. It's possible to use self-signed certificates, but the certificate itself should have version 3: https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/47#issuecomment-297509272. Here is the guide how such certificate can be created: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18233835/creating-an-x509-v3-user-certificate-by-signing-csr. The certificate generated by openssl with default (legacy) params won't work.
The server you mentioned uses self-signed certificate generated with default params presumably. However there's at least 1 server (`bch.cyberbits.eu:50002`) that uses valid Let's Encrypt certificate so it doesn't require the `disable_cert_verification` at all.";"";"";
"457121878465708043";"artem.pikulin#0794";"28-Oct-19 04:27 PM";"`{\""url\"":\""electrumx-bch.cryptonermal.net:50002\"",\""protocol\"":\""SSL\"",\""disable_cert_verification\"":true}` also works, so I guess it's worth to pick the addresses that work and just skip the others since it might be quite hard to change the MM2 behavior in this case.";"";"";
