HTLC on bitshares is live now and they are implementing the swaps and transfers stuff and uiux now, would be great to bridge the two communities and all of their currently supported coins (bitshares has over 2000 active assets atm). if so, could you please have them either ping me on telegram @kenCode, or join the @htlcbts telegram group? 
 
my job is with the palmpay point of sale systems and we want to connect to more/as many atomic order books as possible so the customers get the best possible pricing at the cash register.

"423176312354635779";"gcharang#6833";"17-Jun-19 04:23 PM";"@wbradt this is the protocol:
```
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`

A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2)
A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)
After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4)
When A takes the KMD, he reveals the secret `secret_A` which will allow B to claim BTC

The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and ""ease of use""

Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A don't reveal the secret `secret_A`
```

Ofcourse, once the order is matched and the swap starts, you will only be dealing with one other person";"";"";

"423176312354635779";"gcharang#6833";"18-Jun-19 04:06 AM";"@wbradt 
before the order is matched, you can advertise the same coins in many different pairs
Ex: If you have 1 btc, you can have orders up for selling it for ETH, KMD, LTC etc., at the same time

but if any one of the orders is matched, the same BTC can't be used by anyone until the swap goes through or times out

```
