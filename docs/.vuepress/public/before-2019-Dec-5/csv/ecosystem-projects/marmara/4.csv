The updated document says that in settlement the system writes off the cheque amount from issuer and endorsers' both activated and lock-in-loop addresses, from top to bottom.
I think it is of course fair that issuer is responsible with all his funds: as he issued the credit and received goods for it then he should pay for it.
But is this fair for an endorser to pay with all his money if the issuer defaults? 
An endorser just gave goods and received goods, he actually gained none in total. Why should he be responsible with his both activated and locked coins?
Isn't it fair if all the endorsers in a loop should be equaly responsible with their locked-in-loop coins if the issuer defaults? 
That is, we could treat lock-in-loop coins as insurance fund which is spent only if the issuer defaults. 
So if he defaults, all endorsers would pay in equal proportion (and it would be easy to manage lock-in-loop fund).";"";"";

But these earnings are more like a bonus for being a guarantor of the debt and freezing money, aren't they? 
Maybe your top-to-bottom schema is perfect and conforms the country law.
I just wanted to remind other possible reasons for endorsers: 
They all have put in lock-in-loop account the part of the collateral. In total it covers the debt for 100%. 
So each of them has prepared to risk that locked amount if case of the issuer defaulting. If the issuer defaults, the risk happens and all of them pay the lock-in-loop amount.
And it seems not quite fair if the system writes off all the debt from the first endorser only, not only money that he has prepared to risk but also other his money.
(I'm not insisting on this, I'm only trying to work out reasons for the fair schema)";"";"";

I aggree that we should not depend on one country only. Did you think what happens during settlement when we integrate Version 2 later? The issuer will be able create any amount and there needs to be no collateral during issuance. If it is in common fund, will other endorsers be able to differentiate the individual sharing of each issuer/endorser in common fund when thinking an issuer can have different credit Loops simultaneously? Will The common fund work out when we have both Version 1 and 2 together in use?";"";"";
