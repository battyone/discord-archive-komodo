Let me try to translate our concern @dimxy and @jl777c .  We made tests with the codes before the addition of blank parameters from Version 2. I think there is a fundamental problem as far as I  see from test results. We need to clarify it. When someone has coins in LCL, he/she should be staking 3x than normal activated. Now it seems to work like this. Suppose I have 40000 activated and no coin in LCL. It works with normal staking power. But supposse I have 10 coins only in LCL and I have 40000 in activated. And someone has  40000 coins in LCL but only 10 coins as activated. He can produce more even if the other person has more in LCL. I think it currently looks at the person if he/she has coins in LCL and prodcues from the activated ones not based on the LCL. LCL wallet address is only one address common to all and actually not stakeable.  Therefore, we don't encourage the real credit creators. People just need to lock something to get full 3x power of staking. If we summarize, we just need to lock something  in LCL to have 3x staking. The 3x staking is based on activated ones and not the coins  in LCL. This is what we see from the system. I think the problem may be solved by making  a stakeable address such as  ""myLCLAmount"" similar to ""myActivatedAmount"". Both  ""myLCLAmount"" and ""myActivatedAmount"" should stake simulatenously according to their contents.  I think ""myAmountOnActivatedAddress-old"" may be deleted. It is not needed any more. It was used to collect the latest 16 activated ones when we were having activated coins  between 3 months to 2 years. Now all coins are activated at a maximum height. I don't know if I could explain the concern well ?@Paro";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"15-Jul-19 09:34 AM";"If we are concerned with that low LCL amount produces small number of blocks (and big amount of activated coins will consume most of the blocks generation) we might disable staking on activated and enable only on LCL coins.

Alternatively we could change the  multiplier for LCL";"";"";
