We need to start the chain with ac_perc. This is actually what we discussed. If we can spend from the blockchain fund it will solve the problem. Suppose I am a holder/issuer/endorser, I have enough activated or boosted but not enough normal to cover small fee. This should be spendable from the blockchain fund. Then this blockchain fund may be used for transferring baton to issuer as well. Is it difficult or impossible technically?";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"29-Jun-19 11:58 AM";"The 'global address' is a feature common for every komodo cc contract. This address might be used for various purposes. It is like a shared account. Although anyone might spend funds from this address this spending is controlled by the validation code.
Currently in marmara this address is used for storage of markers, that is, small amounts on this address which allow to enumerate the transactions which have such an utxo. By this we can find all 'marmaraissue' transactions for open credit loops.
The marmara validation code will allow to spend such markers for the settlement transactions and by this close the credit loop.
And yes we can store marmara's backup fund on this adddress too.";"";"";
"396753788150611968";"B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626";"29-Jun-19 12:14 PM";"Can we start a new test chain such as MCL1 with the common blockchain fund? This is stated in requirements document as the third layer for protection against nonredemption. In case of insufficient normal funds but with enough activated/boosted, this fund may be utilized. Perhaps It may be utilized for transferring baton to issuer at the end when the credit loop expires.";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"29-Jun-19 12:28 PM";"Yes I think we can a new chain which would allow to use common fund to cover normal accounts with insufficient amounts on them.
To allow a miner to transfer the baton we should change the way of baton's storage: now the baton is on the holder's pubkey and no one except him can move the baton. To allow a miner to move it we should store the baton on some special address (like 1of2 address of endorser pk+global pk) which would allow both endorser and miner to move the baton. Plus we will need to write very carefully the validation code to prevent moving the baton in all cases except the settlement.";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"29-Jun-19 01:19 PM";"But from the previous messages I understood we may avoid returning the baton to the issuer after the settlement. How will it be used after it is returned to the issuer?
If we can avoid it I'd suggest maybe not to change this. It seems to me the storing the baton on the loop participant's pubkey is simple solution and does not involve additional transaction validation";"";"";

Please feel free on that. But can we still use the idea of common fund to cover insufficient normal accounts with enough activated/boosted during settlement?";"";"";
"507209916449292303";"dimxy#2587";"29-Jun-19 02:33 PM";"I'd say this is not about which one is easier. It is more like what is needed. I noticed in the chat messages that we are going to use moving the baton back to the issuer to indicate that the loop is closed. But we also have another feature for the same task - the marker. We already do spending the marker at the settlement to closed the loop. Maybe this will solve that task. 
But if not, and we need to move the baton to the issuer for some other reasons, let's do this.

Yes the common fund feature will be implemented, I cannot see any problems to do this.";"";"";

Both amounts should be equal, to make it possible to check the ratio easy.

As PoS nodes generate new activated coins they would interfere with initially set coins for staking.

I have 2 PoS nodes and have on both the pubkeys by 186 coins (as activated coins)
The total supply is 100,000 and most of this amount is on the first pk as normal. I thought it was not relevant as only activated or locked-in-loop coins participate in staking.
My test chain is 333 blocks now
Actually as a first test I tried to set equal amount of activated coins on both the PoS nodes and expected to have approximately equal amounts of coinbase rewards. I waited for 30 blocks and saw that only 3 of them went to the second node rewards, the rest of them went to the first node.

I did not do coins distribution on 64 segids (as this is not implemented yet for marmara activated coins) - maybe this is the cause. If it is, it needs to be implemented first and then continue the test";"";"";
