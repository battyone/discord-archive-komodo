"202999072519356416";"NutellaLicka#4241";"26-Nov-18 05:01 AM";"<b>Pirate, the privacy coin.</b>
Pirate (ARRR) is a cryptocurrency that solves the issue of financial privacy on the blockchain by forcing anonymous transactions. Using ZK-Snarks, 100% of peer-to-peer transactions are shielded. Meaning, no data from a transaction is given and complete anonymity is retained. 

<b>Pirate uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users network activity.</b>
As other privacy coins offer the choice to use regular or shielded addresses, complete anonymity cannot be guaranteed. This privacy compromise is due to data correlation between regular and shielded transactions that can be tracked quite easily. Pirate forces shielded transactions, providing no ability to leak information.

<b>In order to 51% attack Pirate, you would have to first 51% attack Bitcoin. </b>
Komodo's delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) {link this website: https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow/} protects Pirate's blockchain against double spends and 51% attacks. Simply put, a backup of the ARRR chain is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes and can be restored if needed. An attacker would need to compromise the Bitcoin blockchain to destroy the backups, prior to compromising the ARRR chain.
This provides complete security against double spends and hostile takeovers, causing them to be extremely costly and near impossible.";"";"shexy (1)";
