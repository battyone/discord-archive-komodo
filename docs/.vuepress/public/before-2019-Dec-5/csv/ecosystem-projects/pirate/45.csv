But if you visit the Natural History museum in London and ask to see a specimen you’ll be met with blank stares - their collection houses 80 million specimens, and the collection has been digitised so you can search it… but you won’t find a ninja mouse.

Owls have never caught one. So perhaps it’s not surprising that humans haven’t either.

In fact, some question whether ninja mouse even exists, given no one has ever seen or heard one.

To set the image of PIRATE so that professionals can expect to use it, I think it should have a neutral marketing material
