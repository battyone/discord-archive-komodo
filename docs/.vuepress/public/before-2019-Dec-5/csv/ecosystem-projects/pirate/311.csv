The things I would look for in a pool are the following:
Minimum payout (in ARRR): Does my hash rate mean I need a higher/lower payout so I am getting regular payouts, rather than waiting a day or so to be paid.
Pool fee %: What do they do with that %, do they contribute a % to the project or contribute personally? Am I happy to pay that % for the quality of service they offer.
The website design and layout: Is it is an eyesore or does it appeal to me personally? Is it easy to use? Does it provide me with the information I require easily? 
Pool stability: Is the pool reliable? Do the offer backup ports to set my miner too? Have they had a period of downtime lately, has this been rectified? Are they proactive with informing everyone about the reasons why?
Pool features: Does the pool offer any special features you would be interested in?

And finally, hash rate:
For new miners, the other thing I would educate myself on is pool hash rates. It is important to know that a high hash rate pool means that you will receive smaller, more frequent payouts. Compared to a low hash rate pool that will provide higher payouts, at a lower frequency. Over time, theoretically they will both average out to the same. A higher hash rate pool will provide payouts closer to the average, a lower hash rate pool could provide payouts outside the average on a day to day basis (both higher and lower).

These are just my thoughts when coming to choosing a pool, I'd be happy to take feedback.

Whilst i'm here, I may as well advertise my mining pool. http://minethepiratechain.black. We are looking for new miners and offer low payout and 0% fee.

The links below will provide information about mining ARRR as well as a list of pools.

"202999072519356416";"NutellaLicka#4241";"14-Nov-18 04:40 AM";"Another thing miners should be considering (as investors in the coin itself), is whether having all of the hash on one pool is the most secure thing to do. The affects of having 100% of the coins hashrate on 1 pool are a problem and need to be thought about. What if that 1 pool was to go down? What if that pool's operator was to decide to abuse the trust of the miners and misuse their hash?";"";"";

"202999072519356416";"NutellaLicka#4241";"14-Nov-18 05:05 AM";"That is a good thing. I will say, I have opted for a 0% fee to attract miners to my pool. I am however, going to reintroduce a 1% fee in December(and being open and honest about doing so), and a portion of this will be going to the project. I would say that the pools that offer a 0% fee are doing so to attract miners to their pool. It costs time and money to run these things. But if that is the deciding factor on why you choose pool A over B, than that is great.";"";"";
