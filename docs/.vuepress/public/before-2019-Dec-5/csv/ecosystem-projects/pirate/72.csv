If you don't know me by now, well hello, my name is FishyGuts.   People call me Ryan but Fishy will work here.  
I was reached out to by a team member to get in touch with JL777 about directing a marketing effort.    
We initially talked about me doing this full time and I honestly believe that it's not a one man job and besides that, I have a fantastic day job.  
I have spent 20 years in mortgage finance and sales doing literally every job in the book from mailroom grunt to Owner.  
I currently market to brokers and do investment consulting for lenders.   
I don't think JL777 was looking to replace my current income and again, I don't think this is a one man, or a secret job.   
You all are my best resource for marketing material!!!
So yesterday morning JL and I came to an agreement and we want to see PIRATE at #50 on CMC so lets get going!!!

Introduction aside... lets get started.   
I've got the Twitter and reddit setup.   Telegram has been setup as well by who... @Acura ?   Can you forward the login details to Regnar?";"";"";
"427867553784922113";"FishyGuts#5085";"28-Sep-18 01:59 AM";"I have created a Trello board for Marketing and Social Media.   
I don't want to have this as just an inside job.  I think the hive mind of the people here will bring fantastic ideas to the table as well as fine tune existing ones.  
Community members will be able to view and comment here.   Developers and Ambassadors will be able to add and comment on cards.  

Just like PIRATE was born out of drive, time and effort, I do want the marketing to be in the same fashion.   

We can't stop the community from making great content about this.   
What we can do is provide media kits, information and reach.     
I have enlisted @Regnar which many of you know and @Senda to help with art and design for things like releases, infographics and banner ads.   I have other trusted helpers and advisors that I will also be bringing to help the PIRATE project as time goes on.   If you want to participate, just let me know.

That said, this can still be a 100% community effort, as I am only one man and we would be a fool to think one man can handle a task this monumental or a coin with this much momentum.   
Thanks for reading.
