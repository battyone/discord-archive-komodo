A colleague from Haslhofer researched it in the spring: ""We can track normal transactions well, but if they use the Zcash shield, they are virtually anonymous. But that's only an extremely small part of the transactions."" As long as this remains so, it is easy to separate Zcash's suspected criminal transactions from the decent ones.
