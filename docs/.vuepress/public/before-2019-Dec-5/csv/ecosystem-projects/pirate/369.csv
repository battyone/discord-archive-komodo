- Europe [EU]
- North America [NA]
- Asia Russia [AR]

After running in an unofficial testnet for the past week with good results I believe 2 or 3 nodes will be manageable at high performance for the Pirate Notary Team and will help our project tremendously.

Please see our election details and promises at https://notary.pirate.black
Official election page: https://komodoelection.com/proposals/pirate/
Testnet stats: https://notarystats.info/testnet.php

We need your votes mateys! ARRR
