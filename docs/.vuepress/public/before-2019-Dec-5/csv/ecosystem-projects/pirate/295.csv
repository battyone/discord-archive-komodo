A little context. Previous research has identified most of the shielded pool as related to ""mixing."" Users send a specific amount to the shielded pool and back to the transparent pool a short time later. Research has shown heuristics can help trance transactions by following their amounts.

Researchers and attackers now will have an additional method of tracing transactions, since these ""mixing"" transactions will typically follow a specific behavior. It will look as follows:

User sends any number of transparent inputs to one shielded output

User may optionally make fully-shielded transactions from one shielded input to one shielded output

User sends one fully-shielded output to one or two transparent inputs.

While there can be some variation depending on user behavior, this is approximately what will happen for most cases. This is distinctly different than most transactions, eg: with a merchant. This would look like one or more shielded inputs going to two shielded outputs. Thus, a researcher or attacker could look for transactions that either:

Use more than one shielded input, or

Use more than one shielded output

to determine a set of fully-shielded transactions that are likely not involved with mixing. If a transaction is 1-in and 1-out, then there is strong evidence this transaction is associated with mixing, unless a sender is sending the full value of only one of their outputs and receiving no change (unlikely to happen unless they shielded only the exact amount needed for the purchase, which would be likely subject to amount heuristics)";"";"";
