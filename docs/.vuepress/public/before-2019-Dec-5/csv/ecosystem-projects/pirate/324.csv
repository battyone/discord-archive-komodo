I'm going to pause some of the other opensource projects and work on this problem instead...this BCH crap needs a solution...if mining could be made so that solo miners get shares against the entire blockchain POW then mining pools wouldn't be able to have centralized control over hash power...the protocol would absorb and payout shares for all POW submitted ...this would make the upper end of mining not as profitable...but would distribute some of the reward to the solo miner.  A big miner would still get paid more than a small miner...but there would then be no need to join a pool.  DM me if interested...I created a test chain and master node topology from open source code this weekend and am working on getting the DVM system working.  I'll be working on this in the evenings for the next week...want to have feature ready by next Friday.   Also if anyone else has heard of anyone working on this please let me know...so many projects that maybe someone somewhere is already working on this.  Centralized control of the monetary system is what BTC was supposed to prevent...our use of mining pools  have concentrated power once again.   I'll ping you again next weekend when I have more code to share.  Off to pick the cotton!";"";"";

-Pirate coin is a privacy focused cryptocurrency that is fully decentralized, meaning there is no third party in charge of your funds at any time.  Private transactions are confirmed in a trustless manner on the blockchain.  This means you do not need a third party to verify that your transactions are valid, the pirate code takes care of that.
-Pirate coin uses a highly advanced and respected privacy protocol to hide the data of your transactions.  This is accomplished through the use of an advanced technology called zk-snarks, which we have adopted and required on 100% of the send transactions.  This is considered by many prominent developers to be one of the strongest methods of hiding your financial data on the blockchain.   ZK-snarks effectively erases all of the public data from your transaction that is normally viewable on the public ledgers.
-All Pirate chain transactions are private by default.  This alleviates the problem that many cryptocurrencies with optional privacy introduce into their protocol.  These optional private transactions used by the majority of other privacy coins provide anchors for data to be analyzed and  thereby weakening the overall privacy protection for users.  This complete privacy protocol also provides users with additional assurance that no authorities in the future can come along and claim that users funds are ""tainted"" or ill gotten due to previous transactions";"";"";
"427867553784922113";"FishyGuts#5085";"19-Nov-18 09:42 PM";"-Pirate crypto allows for quick and secure transfer of value across the world for both the customer and the vendor.  The fees are very inexpensive, there is no chance for fraudulent chargebacks, no erroneous fund verification periods, and transactions are confirmed and secured within minutes.  These features alone can save merchants and vendors across the globe save billions of dollars by cutting out facilitation fees.
-Being a decentralized cryptocurrency, Pirate welcomes developers and contributors of all skillsets.  There are over 30 contributers to date, who have provided services to the growth and development of Pirate chain.  Developers are all working in a team fashion to bring in knowledge and experience from all parts of the crypto sphere.  With our diverse group, there is always someone with the knowledge of how to complete a needed task, or someone with a connection to someone who can.  We have completed many first time accomplishments in the Cryptocurrency realm when it comes to privacy protection and we will continue to innovate and collaborate with the community towards these efforts.";"";"";
"427867553784922113";"FishyGuts#5085";"19-Nov-18 09:42 PM";"Financial privacy is crucial for so many people for so many reasons.  Privacy is needed by vendors, distributors, merchants, purchasers, suppliers, service providers and customers.   Pirate plans to support community efforts for a legitimate marketplace to parlay your pirate coin for goods and services.  Customers deserve privacy and speed in their transactions, period.   Businesses can assure their clients and themselves that both parties to the transaction will receive the privacy and speed they expect.
Business is cutthroat and it's critical for some businesses to protect their relationships to retain their edge on their respective markets.  The ability to incorporate a cryptocurrency with the ease of use, speed, flexibility and financial privacy that Pirate offers will secure this critical advantage that powers many businesses in todays market.   Pirate offers an enormously beneficial means of transacting and exchanging value. The traditional and very cumbersome methods that exist within legacy banking systems are not only detrimental to businesses, but can be costly to businesses in many ways.  Your transactions can be at the scrutiny and whim of being reversed by a third party with no rights, reasons or understandings to your business.  Todays FIAT currencies are already making a mass exodus towards digital systems.   Any soverign cryptos created in the future will surely not be wholly private and still be likely subject to manipulation as it already is... as opposed to a decentralized blockchain protocol run by math.
The code exists today such that we no longer need to have these middlemen and facilitators managing our transactions. 
We're here to help  to preserve peoples privacy along the way.";"";"🐙 (11)";
