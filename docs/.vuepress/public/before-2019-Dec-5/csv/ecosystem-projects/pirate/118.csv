Give a blind person 2 balls of the exact same size, shape and weight, but two different colors.
Have them hold the balls behind their back and then show you one.   
Have them put the balls behind their back again and switch them, or not.
You can tell the blind man if he switched them correctly each time no matter what he does.
Do it enough times and it's not coincidence. 
He doesn't know how or why but he knows you're right.
