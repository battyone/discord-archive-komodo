I added a new rpc call getbalance64 that will show the mature and immature balances for utxo in the wallet. this will allow you to see where your coins are.
I will make a way with marketmaker to generate 64 addresses (and their privkeys) so you can create an address per segid easily

there is also alright's method to generate addresses

So the first step is to use one method or the other to generate addresses and register it by posting it in a JSON tha tis parseable. That will allow the creation of a global map for the segids using -addressindex.

In order to make it more interesting I will put up a 1000 KMD price to whoever stakes the most during the one week stakefest. After that we will evaluate the next step. hopefully we get some tools during the first phase and for the second phase I will be looking for the best algo to maximize results, likely a 2000 KMD prize. Likely we will need some automation that generates coin transfers based on the algo and we can have some submissions for the algo competition";"";"";

komodod is able to launch independent chains with PoS/PoW generation of blocks. the ratio can be 0% to 100% PoS. The PoS uses a unique 64-way segmented staking where each utxo's address is in one of 64 different segment ids (segid) and each segid creates a staking battle within each segment. Each block the ""0 segid"" rotates and becomes eligible to stake first. Every 2 seconds, the next segid becomes eligible, so after 128 seconds all utxo are eligible, but the lower segids are having the advantage.

The goal of the contest is to find the best algos for allocating your stake across the different segids. A naive allocation of 1/64th to all the segments would be better than having all funds in one address, but the game theory requires to know where the stakes of the other people influence how you allocate your funds.

In order to participate, join the CHIPS discord as we will conduct the testing there since this is like a game. To generate 64 addresses, the latest marketmaker has a gen64addrs api:

source userpass
curl --url ""http://127.0.0.1:7783"" --data ""{\""userpass\"":\""$userpass\"",\""method\"":\""gen64addrs\"",\""passphrase\"":\""default\""}""

of course use a better passphrase than ""default"", it will return an array of address/wif and also just the addresses. post your 64 address array in the CHIPS discord to register for the contest. the gen64addrs api will also print out the required importprivkey cli calls to import all the addresses into a wallet.

there is a getbalance64 call in the komodod that will print your wallet's segid balances. we will start the contest this week, likely on Thursday, so there is a few days to get setup. use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker";"";"";
