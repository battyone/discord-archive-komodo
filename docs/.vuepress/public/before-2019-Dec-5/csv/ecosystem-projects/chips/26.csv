Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

The video recorded the pixels 1 to 1 so it looks a bit mushy. But be assured that it's much more crisp in real life (since pretty much every graphic is a vector).

Keep in mind that the first testable version will be considerably slower than what you see here due to latency occurring while communicating with the backend. It's something that we will need to work on for better UX.
