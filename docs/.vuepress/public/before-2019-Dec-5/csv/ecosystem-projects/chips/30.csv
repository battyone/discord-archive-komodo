instructions how to install dev version (python):
git clone https://github.com/pbca26/electrum -b dev chips-electrum
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
python3 -m pip install .[fast]
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler

the above steps assumes you already have python3 installed

run it with verbose param:

What I don't respect is is his continual going on about how much money he spends on his own private projects and how that should make him special above others.

sg777 has done a **lot** of feken work and **that** should be respected far more than some bullshit about ""I am paying by the hour and this is very inefficient.""";"";"";

The private project you mentioned is to make a open source GUI for THIS community. If i did not do it, no one would and we would be no closer to releasing a playable app.  So take your need for attention and you can shove it up your ass.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"31-Jul-19 12:45 PM";"[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I believe HyperDEX is being very generous towards the project and wants to see it succeed. sg777 is also in the same boat and is being compensated for their time and effort. 
I'd hesitate on commenting about how other people are using their money or speculating on how they shouldnt/should have used it. If you feel the need to, I'd say put your money where your mouth is ;)
