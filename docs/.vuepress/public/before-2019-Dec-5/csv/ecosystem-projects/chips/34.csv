A multi-sig donation address is an address that requires multiple people to sign transactions prior to actually sending any funds. For instance, this is a 3 of 5 Multi-sig address. Meaning 3 out of the 5 authorised people must sign the transaction for it to be processed.
This specific address will replace all other CHIPS donation addresses and has @sg777 @jorian @PHBA2061 @Strob and myself as the authorised signers.
This will be the address NN's and other community donations will be put into.

`bRFaD5CPeb7jVENWf65CoVEADZUVYW2FoS` is the address. Feel free to transfer into it like any other address, both CHIPS or KMD!

If you have any questions, please ask!";"";"";
