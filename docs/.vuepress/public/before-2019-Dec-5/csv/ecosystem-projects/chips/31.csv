I am writing as a representative of the CHIPS project and would like to provide an update for the CHIPS coin you have listed.

Currently the coin is still active and is in heavy development. Our development activities can be tracked in our discord at link here and in the github repo's linked below.

Firstly, you may be reading this and asking yourself, what is CHIPS? Well, read on.
CHIPS is a trust-less, peer-to-peer, secure, on chain poker application.
Other online poker facilitators use centralised servers to host the poker application itself, requiring users to trust their companies and connect to their nodes. They also may even accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, but unlike these applications, CHIPS uses actual blockchain technology to: 
- run a p2p blockchain that stores the cryptocurrency used for betting (also secured by Komodo dPoW),
- uses a p2p cryptographic function for deck shuffling and allocation (shamir secret keys), and
- uses lightning network technology to create a real time betting platform.

Below are links to both of the explorers, plus some exchanges we are now listed on.

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"02-Aug-19 08:21 AM";"[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> ```I would also like to add that we have multiple github repos & projects we are currently contributing to in development of the CHIPS poker application.
The CHIPS blockchain itself: 
https://github.com/jl777/chips3
The CHIPS LN:
https://github.com/jl777/lightning/tree/dev
The CHIPS betting application/protocol:
https://github.com/sg777/bet

I hope this provides conclusive evidence that CHIPS is still quite active, although with low liquidity due to an intensive development phase. If you would like more information or clarification, please don't hesitate to reply to this email, or find me in the CHIPS discord.

Regards,
NutellaLicka

2) may be it's worth mentioning that once we successfully test CHIPS on poker, then it can be used for any other casino games, not just poker.
3) at minute 21 you said ""if you're looking to be more anonymous, then we do have a CHIPS/ARRR on exchange, so you can purchase CHIPS with your ARRR"" , imo the moment you trade your coins on an exchange, your anonymity are partially exposed.";"";"";

Yeah I mispoke there. Still trying to wrap my head around all the terminology and how it interacts with one another. 
I will definitely start to have a think about the wider CHIPS application. I think focusing on the one application now will help people understand how it is used better. Introducing other use cases after we have successfully created the poker application will be a breeze then!
And agreed, the privacy discussion can be a long one, my intention wasn't to delve into that as I wanted to speak to the CHIPS side of things. But definitely point noted.";"";"";

It is about getting GUI to work then getting backend to work as expected then GUI to work with that again.
