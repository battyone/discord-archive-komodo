1. When is token sale
2. Do you have an estimate of percentages? Say if I held $1000 of CC tokens, how much volume would need to move through the DEX to award me with $1000 worth of kmd?
3. Is this pretty much just a mobile version of the Barterdex? How are you making the fees? From memory Barterdex has around .15% fee already. Did you get permission from KMD to use those fees towards rewards? Or how are you able to offer the fees at bdex rates as well as rewarding CC holders? üòÆ 
4. You mention LP node margins. So do you plan on being a LP to a range of coins and using those margins to payout to CC holders?";"";"";
