If people wanted, I would not mind doing an online excel so that each incoming transaction can be checked starting at 4:59 PM, as well as the payment exit transaction.
As I said, I do not think that they play more than 10 VRSC per day, since each person will only play once and to play 10 VRSC they would have to play 100 people and 10 VRSC are approximately 1-2 $, so they do not. I think nobody bothers to do something to scam 1-2 $";"";"";
