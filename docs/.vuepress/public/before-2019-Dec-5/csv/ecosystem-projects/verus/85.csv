It's likely that there will no longer be much of a speed difference between nheqminer, the wallet, and ccminer on CPUs with VerusHash 2.0, but Chris will almost certainly keep the optimizations that are there now and still apply in the final step, so if there is a ccminer option, it should have at least a little more hash power.
@technopato all wallets will need to be upgraded to be able to process the new hash for the blocks on the chain. staking functionality will not change at all.
