It just seems that there may be some underestimation of the human capacity for greed here. I dont see the manufacturer giving you any option other than the nuclear one. The parable of the scorpion and the fox/toad comes to mind. And EVEN if we were able to strike a deal with THIS manufacturer....it's just ONE!!! manufacturer....what stops the next one and the next one, esp as Verus grows from strength to strength as intended? I understand my arguments actually raise even MORE problems, as the seeming only option it leaves is go nuclear and prepare for an endless arms race that will ultimately cripple the project anyway, but I feel it's worthwhile to raise these questions now, if they address the exploratio of avenurs that lead nowhere anyway...";"";"";

by addressing the issue now, we have a chance to put it to rest at a low and accessible price point, especially if by not ratcheting up, we make mining accessible to many more people going forward. more casual mining with CPUs and GPUs for those with cheap/free electricity, and professional mining, still decentralized with FPGAs, that will have versions with similar economics for less than the current ones if we get agreement. not just from one company, as the algorithm will be open, which is an important part of agreeing, but they developed it or paid to develop it, so being first to market is just where they are. if they cooperate and have a good product that they make more accessible to the community, they will have done something to redeem themselves. they did promise to us that only their customers were mining, not them, so there is still some argument that they didn't centralize Verus.";"";"";

I ask bcos it cld be a means of staying ahead of what I see as having to continually pay sort of a ""protection"" fee to companies that come up with this hardware. If verus made or bankrolled  the best ones on the market, that wd automatically default the ecosystem back to the original vision of fairness amongst everyday, non commercial community members/regular miners. Sure, some ""market share"" so to speak wd be siphoned away from gpus and esp cpus, but this new balance wd def leave them better off, since verus wd be the main distributor of these machines, and thus wd have the community's best interest at heart, while still achieving the required decentralization.";"";"";

The foundation would also offer them a time locked bounty for following the algorithm and making it open, so they will have an ongoing future stake in Verus Coin through this transition.";"";"";

He's saying this is coming, and in his opinion, the best option is to work with them. It's sort of a trust and verify set up. I think one thing he's saying that you're not appreciating is it's not going to be that easy to just declare all out war on the fpga company and fork the algo. It's gonna take up too much time and resources, and just get worse as most of the development will start being directed to being an endless forking project. If the project can cooperate now, it not only solves this immediate stuation, but ameliorates the inevitable issues that will rear their heads down the line because of the new economics created by coolerating with this company..does that make sense...?";"";"";

So, I'm getting out before the coins will be all mined by FPGAs and control the prices/run down the price.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"04-Dec-18 10:22 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @miketout I think we are missing something. This community is currently built around CPU and GPU miners that cooperate to mine the coin. If we decide that FPGAs are ok, and don't fork, we are basically cutting 80% of the community from the PoW supply as currently a single 2500$ specialized mining hardware is mining more hash than ~160x GTX 1060 GPU farm, forget the small CPU miners or single GPU miners that will not even get a dust as reward for their mining. Actually, that single unit of FPGA represents and average of ~100 people mining casually with their high end CPUs or ~5000 people mining with their typical notebook CPU. I have no problem with the existence of FPGAs, I have a problem with cutting any economic incentive for regular people to get involved when we basically are extremely early and have no big community. If we say ok to the FPGAs, we are fine with ASICs too by default - so we just want more hashrate for the network and are not interested in casual miners or non-miners that are willing to start their journey. The question in here is - are we really mature enough to cut the PoW mining as a way to get involved? Are we really already there? Bitcoin is not mineable at home, ETH is not mineable at home, but those networks are mature, have worldwide community and so on. Are we not afraid that we will kill the growth of our community with the exclusion of any PoW mining incentive? No one will run their CPU for months to get a single coin worth pennies. I am really afraid we are not ready for any other move than hard forking the FPGAs out of the network at the current state of the community.";"";"";
