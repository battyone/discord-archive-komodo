In pretty much every description on Verus by the team/supporters, inevitably listed as a top feature after triple secure and sapling is asic/industrial miner resitant...it's not even eoy yet, and someone's already developed one. I'm  a huge supporter of the project, so this concerns me and I'm raising questions accordingly. Tbh, the team's approach of the hardware manufacturer to broker some kind of deal struck me as...a little naive? What did they expect in response? That wd be like approaching Bitmain and asking them to slow down their miners cos Satoshi wd have disapproved. I don't mean to come off snarky, but pls take my tone as a reflection of how jarring this news was to me. I took the team at their word that this sort of development wd be near impossible, but more realistically - an exceedingly onerous undertaking that wd likely not be seen for a significant amount of time. If we're hard forking already, then it seems this is just the beginning of the same old story in crypto- the cat and mouse game that bigger projects like Monero have been playing for years now. If it's more accurate to just remove the ""equality of cpu/gpu"" and asic resistant selling and strong points, what does that mean for the future of Verus as such a strong community underpinned project supposedly built into its DNA?

What I see is a philosophical battle going on about how egalitarian mining will be achieved.  Basically the ProgPoW argument is that we can use an ""extension"" to other algorithms to assure mutual cost sharing.  Therefore, ""ASICs"" could still be made but they wouldn't be anymore profitable than mining with a CPU or GPU.  The other argument (and I'm sure there are others) is that the only way to truly achieve egalitarian mining is to default to the fact that we are human and rely on human influences even if that means tribal warfare (BCH ABC vs BCH SV).  Therefore,  the true measure of egalitarian mining relies on the AGILITY of algorithm developers to stay ahead of ASIC producers or some other source of centralized mining (network warfare).  

ProgPoW is definitely interesting but I'm not so sure how widespread adoption will go.  So far, I'm still stuck at a point believing that developer agility will remain the dominant influence on PoW mining.

Admittedly.. I still have a bazillion videos to watch to learn more about ProgPoW and how it's not an ""algorithm"" it's an ""extension""... okay, but even that lends more to favoring developer agility lol";"";"";
