Then I went into native mode, because I wanted to mine (and this is where transferred all the VRSC I bought, because I wanted to stake it). 
Are these the same wallets? 
For example, if I installed Agama on a different computer (or something happened where this computer died), could I restore the balance iny native mode wallet with that seed phrase?
Or do I have to make sure my .dat file I stored somewhere else to recover the balance in Native mode?";"";"";
