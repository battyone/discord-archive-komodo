John posted this link to logos about a week ago. I guess the svg version is vector so it can be scaled for high rez in any size.
I like the idea of a sticker contest or just have people maybe come up with a bunch of ideas and make something together. I might have a go at it and play around with the logo and some ideas during the week ahead.

And in my opinion, ""Purgatory"" is not better than ""unloved"", in contrary it is probably worse, and Verus might be kicked out of their discord if we can't at least partially fill their ""application"" form and publish it. That's why I posted it above, so the empty parts could be filled in by people who know. And about their desired mods or devs, I think we could give a hint to come to Verus discord for answers,  if noone else is present there. Guess this could also work.";"";"";
