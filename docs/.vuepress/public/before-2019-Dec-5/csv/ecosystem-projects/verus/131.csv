In our brief time there and my occasional visits, I've found being added there to be minimally beneficial both to us and for their own members. The layout doesn't help anyone to find anything new out anyhow.
Apparently they have a very specific definition for what a CPU mineable project is now, one that they're seemingly ok with misrepresenting to their own members that look to them for guidance and one that also technically happens to not fit the standard English definition for the suffix ""able"" by any account..

We raised it to 5 to strengthen the general connectivity and raise average connection count a bit, rather than jump to 6. Raising it to 5 did create more connectivity on some nodes that we were watching, but raising it to 6 might still strengthen things further if the network can easily handle it. Network connectivity overall seems pretty healthy, but if it can absorb a little more connectivity at 6 outgoing, because there's extra capacity on open nodes, then it won't hurt. thanks for the info.";"";"";
