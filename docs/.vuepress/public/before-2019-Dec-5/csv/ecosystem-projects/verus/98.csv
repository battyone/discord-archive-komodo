Komodo has their own timelines and priorities. At some point, I would expect jl777 and I to coordinate to get VerusHash 2.0 into Komodo because people will want it. Talking about that, or speculating on when it might be probably won't help anyone, as right now, it is in Verus. There is no specific timeframe or energy going towards doing that now, and it will be a meaningful amount of work for someone whenever that time comes.
@dude as with all cryptocurrencies, a primary use case is money, and the level of network security and resistance to various forms of attack that Verus is demonstrating right now shows why people should use very secure networks like Verus over other, maybe even larger coins based on older technologies that haven't been upgraded with solutions to their well known weaknesses. We prefer to talk about how it works today, while we work on, but don't hype or sell the future. Right now, Verus has many use cases, starting with one of the most secure cryptocurrencies for money to private / permanent / notarized messaging, to every BTC and Zcash use case with arguably much more advanced security, and as such provides a better, more secure, more private cryptocurrency than most all of the projects out there.
As far as use cases that we envision for the future, that is PBaaS, including the advance of public provisioning that it will bring, the new profit potential for stakers, miners, and service providers, as well as applications, such as identity and voting that it will first enable, which we believe will be only a couple important ones among many, geo-scalable blockchain applications.";"";"";

""The algorithm leverages the features of modern CPUs, leaving other hardware such as GPU or FPGA, already advantaged in other ways, to do the same work using whatever optimizations developers of such software and hardware are able to achieve. For example, modern CPUs have higher clock speeds than FPGAs, highly integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, the fastest being it‚Äôs L1 Cache.
By designing VerusHash 2.0 such that it utilizes each of these advantages to run more efficiently, any device without them needs to find other ways to get those same efficiencies. Rather than explicitly attempting to block FPGAs or GPUs from functioning on the algorithm, the approach simply goes all out in leveraging efficiencies that CPUs can bring to the table, leaving FPGAs and GPUs to fend for themselves in other ways.""";"";"";
