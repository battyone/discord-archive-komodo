Also, upon further consideration, I guess I took a look at Bitcoin and realized over 17m of the total 21m are already mined/released, and that's just in the 1st 10 years of its existence. So relative to the mother of all cryptos, I guess VRSC isn't too dissimilar.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Apr-19 12:18 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @ABK the answer is found on page 21 of the Vision Paper:

During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining and staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and 3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as well as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network and project.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Apr-19 12:22 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And too much coins generated (in general) equals devaluation...";"";"";

The concern here is ending up right back at the problem that a ""no pre-mine"" crypto project was aiming to avoid in the first place. I'm not saying I know for sure it is an issue with Verus, I'm just saying I see the potential for this issue, and think it bears examination.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Apr-19 01:07 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @jintaa that section covers the question from @ABK just fine. It just doesnâ€™t cover your concerns, which I havenâ€™t addressed.
As for your concerns: the presence of large mining farms becoming whales is imho a far greater concern when looking forward, since they destabilize the decentralization.
As for the oligopoly you mention: that it s only a financial position. Without having any backing technology to enforce changes or decisions, itâ€™s worthless.
I am also confident that a number of investors will release (some of) their coins, once the price of Verus rises sufficiently for them to make a descent profit, thus spreading those coins publicly.
I agree with the vision that after pBaaS is released, the demand for VRSC will grow and the price will rise.
Finally, but most important: a pre-mine will render only the developers with a stash of coins, the mechanism used here avoids that. The developers and the early adopters take a proportional share of the early coins.
Since the early coins are not confined to a closed group, like with pre-mining, it is unjustifiable to use the word oligopoly in this context.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Apr-19 01:27 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> It's a matter of degree. The fact that the majority of the early rewards go to 200 early investors as opposed to 20 developers is just a matter of one instance being slightly less bad. THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT. I'm not saying that's the case here. But to say the oligopoly concern is unjustifiable I don't think understands what I'm asking. In any case, the debate at this point is academic: I'm not divesting from Verus anytime soon, and neither is any of us here, so I continue to cheer the team, the community members and the ecosystem on, as always.";"";"";
