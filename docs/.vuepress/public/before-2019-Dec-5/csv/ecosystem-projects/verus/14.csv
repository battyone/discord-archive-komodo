I like VRSC because of the general vision and the people behind it are notable individuals with real world experience. The decentralization effort is of very unique interest. If there was a coin that seems to be on par with security and practice like the current mainstream coins, it is VRSC.

I am mining for the idealism first and foremost. I like the vision paper a lot, even if it is a bit cheesy at times (reminds me of the first few episodes of Silicon Valley). I do like cheesy though really ;)

Secondly I am mining for the tech, there is a great blend of some of the strongest pieces of crypto development so far here. The clincher was the CPU mining, which makes mining accessible and realistic for those of us who don't want to buy a ton/have a ton of GPUs ready to go. I had one PC, then I bought a Ryzen 2700 just to mine this coin. CPU mining plus POS also makes mining more democratic, and probably less resource intensive, and with the algo developments from 0.3.8 onwards, should allow for relatively sustainable decentralisation. 

Other points are that the vision paper not only has ideas for ""making the world a better place"" through decentralised voting system and free/open information sharing etc, it also has ideas to gain mass appeal - such as phone apps for voting on your favourite pets. Make that accessible enough and mass appeal is a real possibility. 

Lasty but importantly, after I did a little reading through Mike's CV. I have to say I couldn't be happier that such a great project is being led by such an accomplished individual and supported by his network. The progressive work done with the CPU algo just goes to show what is possible.";"";"";

It looks like there are one or two projects for bitcoin that should work with Verus with little modification, given the RPC compatibility. That's something I'd like to do when time permits.
