On another topic, based on the significant rise in hash rate, I think we can safely say that if there were any GPU miners active, they have been completely out hashed by this upgrade ðŸ˜ƒ sometime, we will find out if GPUs can keep up with this. if they can, i am doubtful that they'll be competitive at similar power draw. hopefully CPUs will now be useful miners for quite some time";"";"";

Someone working on a GPU miner first led me to believe that GPUs were going to be a threat to CPUs and then also discovered that this was possible and mined at least one block with the the method. Prior to that, we had left the option to close this method off or use it at some point. We had to decide immediately, and after a lot of calculating, determined that providing it to everyone would be the best chance to keep CPUs viable indefinitely, so we chose that option. Exact timing was coincidental and definitely not the most convenient personally.
