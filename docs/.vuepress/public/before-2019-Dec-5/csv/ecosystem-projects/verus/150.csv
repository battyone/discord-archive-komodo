During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and 3 months.""*
