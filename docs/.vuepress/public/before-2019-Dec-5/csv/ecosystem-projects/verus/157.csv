I took a look at the spreadsheet and didn't see any of the Xeon X series CPUs benchmarked that you can buy in  refurbished servers.  I tried a dual processor hex core Xeon X5680 at 3.3 GHz.  At 2 threads per each core, mining with 24 total threads, it underperformed AWS instance Xeon Platinum 8175Ms at 2.5 GHz and Xeon E5-2686 at 2.3 GHz.

This is why when I spoke with Josh Beneloh about Verus, his fundamental issue was that we were using a public blockchain, which boiled down to him wanting a central authority to control vs. decentralized in my understanding. The big difference here is that, but if you believe in centralization, I suspect they have a solution in that context that is better that what people use today for elections. IMO, we should use this news to start a conversation, especially as PBaaS is entering testing. Thoughts?";"";"";

Generally, I believe this validates the importance of these applications for people and when it is available, which it isn't yet, will offer a set of open-source tools for development that can be used to make and run non-blockchain, centralized elections that employ zero knowledge privacy in some way and are auditable cryptographically. I think in this case, we need to consider that decentralized public polling and elections is one of the important applications we want to enable with PBaaS, and not only does Verus have technology to make that capability confidential, verifiable, and transparent, it will be available to everyone with Verus to use and secured by the voters themselves, which is why that is part of our vision.
