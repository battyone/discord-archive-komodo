It's an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not official KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard!

The Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining or staking (reward transactions) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that’s how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the „Send“ screen and use „Shield a coinbase transaction“ (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you’ll automatically start staking.";"";"";
