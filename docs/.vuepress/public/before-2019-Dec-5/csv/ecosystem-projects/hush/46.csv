In theory, it will take a few seconds to generate and about 2.5 minutes to be confirmed in a block. But confirmations are less important for most messages. The message ""Thanks for the gift, see you next time"" does not need confirmations, but ""SELL ALL ASSETS"" would be something you wanted notarized confirmations for.  51% attacks don't make much sense against messages/memos, except to deny them. A 51% attacker can act as a censor, and block transactions from anybody or everybody, if it wants. But it has to spend lots of time/money to do that, so it would only make sense to do that strategically.";"";"";
