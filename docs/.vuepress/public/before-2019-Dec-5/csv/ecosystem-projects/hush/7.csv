It is OK to update his 1st post. Once this page in English updated we could contact the other members who created the ads in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãso that they update their post too.
What could help us is to get back in touch with these members and see if they are OK to update their post.

If we can not get in touch with them (some have not logged in to the Bitcointalk site for over 1 year). It will certainly remove their links visible on the page https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2008578.0

If they are OK, we can translate the ad, create the new graphics with the translated texts, insert them on github and finally give them the code to insert in their post to update their page.
