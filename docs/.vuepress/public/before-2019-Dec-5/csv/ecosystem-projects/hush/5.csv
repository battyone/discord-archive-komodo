"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"07-Sep-18 12:14 AM";"[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Here is something to think about relevant to BTCH supply: We airdropped about 16M BTC into the BTCH chain, but there have been many studies about how most likely, about ~4M BTC is lost forever, on broken harddrives or owned by dead people or whatever. That 4M BTCH that corresponds with it is ""dead"", it will never be bought/sold/mined, and that means that current BTCH supply is actually less than 21M, if you think about coins that can be bought+sold. SO, *if* BTCH supply doubles to 42M (seems likely, but written in blood yet), the accessible supply will be 42 - 4 = 38M, which is good for current BTCH hodlers, because it means that they will not be diluted by a full 2X.";"";"";

In case of 1. it's really unique, then there should be a specific usability that any other token does not offer or offer in a worse way. If second - we have sth so we try to create value for it - then it's more about marketing and hype work to me, or maybe even useless.";"";"";

If it works the project could be expanded and BTCH could become for example a rev token for BOT generating revenue - but it's a distant perspective. But in that case it would have a real world intrinsic value. And CC could be used to auto send revenue generated by BOT to all BTCH holders";"";"";
