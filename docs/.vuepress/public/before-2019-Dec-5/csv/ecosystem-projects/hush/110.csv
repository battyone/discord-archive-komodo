I have my seed and my Private_keys for my Hush but I never converted it over to HUSH3 and I am using an agama wallet from like Mar 2018. What are my first steps to even know if my balance is still mine?";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"05-Jun-19 08:52 PM";"[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its ""ok"" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

How to Generate new address quickly?
Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)

Alternative method to generate new address
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

How to send funds to the new address?
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2. You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

Where to send funds?
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)";"";"";
