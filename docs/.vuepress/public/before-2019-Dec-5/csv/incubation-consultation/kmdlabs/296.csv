"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"17-Feb-19 01:31 AM";"Well ive checked it out. From what I can see everything is working great. Notaries are getting 3.75 coins per notarization @ 4 notaries. This obviously seems very high but 4 notaries is very low.  We should use 6 min sigs for launch at least, although as long as notarizations are distributed reasonably fairly, the total amount earn't per notary will even out, no matter what amount of notaries are participating in each notarization.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"17-Feb-19 01:33 AM";"Using a larger number of minsigs, forces more nodes to participate regadless of their location, so by using 6 rather than 4, it will spread the payments more fairly.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"17-Feb-19 01:34 AM";"I think to know for certain though we need a proper stats script. If someone can sort this for LABSTH that would be great.

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"17-Feb-19 01:42 AM";"Unless something breaks or major bugs are found, its just a matter of getting coin emission decided and we can luanch the main chain. I have a few things to sort out fo r 0BR but the are not anyhting major, mostly need a way to make sure that the entire chain wont stop if a single staking node goes down, the stakig weight needs to be spread over either a few nodes or all notary nodes. I think I know how to do this, but not 100% aure how hard it will be or how long it may take, definatly isnt as hard as notary payment mechanisim though... So doubtful it will take weeks. We dont need this for launch right away tough. So it wont cause any delays there.";"";"";
