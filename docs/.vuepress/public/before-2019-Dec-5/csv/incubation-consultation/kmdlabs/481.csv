In my case I want the same as you.  I want the process to be verifiable.  The z-tx is used to anonymize what the voter votes for.

- Voters are known (pubkey).  

- They are sent 1 coin + tx fees (enough for 2 transactions) each T-address

- They send the coin to a Z-address

- From the Z-address to the address that they vote for

One coin in the vote address coins as a vote.  

This needs to be modified with the new info from above.";"";"";
