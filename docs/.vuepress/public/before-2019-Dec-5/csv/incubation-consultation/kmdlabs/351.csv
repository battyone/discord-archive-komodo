With the new rescan it should be quite easy to fix the issue. So simply preventing iguana from notarizing if the wallet is full of spent utxos seems a reasonable solution.";"";"";

It now pulls a listunspent on each coin as it adds them then loops `gettxout` on each utxo. If there are utxos in the wallet that are spent iguana will just exit. 
This only prevents someone breaking notarizations by accident. But its better than not having it. Only calls on load, It lists all the spent utxo in the wallet then just exits. Requires manually fixing the issue with the height rescan I made yesterday. We will need some documentation for this so people know what to do. But it works fine.";"";"abusedsmily (1),🔥 (2)";
