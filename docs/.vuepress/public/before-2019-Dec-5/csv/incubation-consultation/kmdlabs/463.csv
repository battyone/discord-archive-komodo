The first month of the 3rd notary season has passed and KMDLabs has gratefully received your donations.  :treasure:  

@mrlynch , who is running the PIRATE nodes, has been putting in a lot of work to keep the PIRATE nodes amongst the top performers while also contributing a great deal to the entire ecosystem.  We would like to thank him for his efforts as well.
