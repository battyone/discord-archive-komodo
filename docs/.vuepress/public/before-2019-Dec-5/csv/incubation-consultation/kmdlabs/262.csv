@blackjok3r The ""problem"" is that alright would like to devise a ""ranking"" system where notaries can opt out of notarizing chains and they are still able to ""rank"" the same way as others that choose to notarize chains.
In other words if we have 10 chains and you notarize all 10 and I only notarize 3, I wouldn't rank below you just for ignoring 7 chains.";"";"";
