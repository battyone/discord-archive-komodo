After the 10,080 snapshot and `paymentsrelease` has been made please send your total balance over all address back to the address you started with. 
The top address will take the prize of 10K LABS, if that is smk762, he said he will share with 2nd and 3rd in post above, so its still worth participating if you have not already. I will not get a place for a prize, I am exempt from winning anything. 
I will also give a total of 5k LABS split over everyone who actually participated. If your balance has not been split for the airdrop @ 8640, you do not get anything üòÉ That leaves approx 12H from now to split to be elegible to get a participation award üòÑ
