For example:
utxovalue = 30;
30% of the value of the staking utxo is added to the coinbase the same as fees,returning the remaining 70% to the address that staked.
utxovalue can be adjusted from any number 0 to 100 via the setstakingsplit RPC.
Can also be set with -splitperc= command line arg, or conf file. 
0 means that it functions as it did previously, and you can use external scripts.
100 means it automates the pos64staker in the daemon (current default), combining the stake tx and the coinbase to an address. Either to -pubkey or a new address from the keystore.
Mining with some optimal % inbetween and without pubkey will over time create varied sized utxos, and evenly distribute them over many addresses and segids.```
