But at the end, left it with 170 txs in the wallet. Seems stable, even if slow ... I think that remvoing the LOCK(cs_walelt) from the erase function might speed it up a heap, but it also seems super unsafe... so not going to.

I will monitor it, I dont think its an issue if the wallet starts from a single utxo... 

There was some logic I added to stop this from happening, but I can see how it cant work, if there are transacitons more than 3 txs deep saved in the wallet. 
Problem is, is that it deletes the txs that came after this tx, so then the wallet sees this tx as unspent. I didnt add logic to iterate back further than 3 txs deep for preformance reasons, but if starting from 1 utxo then splitting, notarising and running the wallet filter, it will always delete the tx it started with on each run, and should not happen.";"";"";
