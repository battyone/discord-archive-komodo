original src forked on github.
being webcam, it makes me think of audio and syncing....so this is where intercepting webrtc streams (which are already mixed) would be easier and chunkify rather than frame-by-frame video, for a workable solution.   at least getting media through browser is demonstratable if we need to at least try with ""dynamic"" content
