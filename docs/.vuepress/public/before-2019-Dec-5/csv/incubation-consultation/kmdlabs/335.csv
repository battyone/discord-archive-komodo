-----------``` If the bureaucracy grows too large the Group Consensus can cull it as needed.```
Basically this mechanism would allow people to get on with Dev work and using LABs.
The elected volunteers would be given the responsibility for day-to-day matters to make this possible.
The way things would work aren't all that different than now.  For example, asking opinions on how to multisig or what logo looks better. 
The only real changes I see from now are that Labs Elected Volunteer(LEV)s would have some ability to take action through the limited trust granted to them through election by Stakers.  The LEV could then make a decision based on what they have learned.
LEVs serve the Group Consensus, and if their actions vary too widely from that path, then Group Consensus has the power to bring things back into line.
At the moment we are still setting things up and most Dev work is focussed on Labs.  That will change and people, including LEVs, will be focussed on `using` the Labs platform.
I think the LEV jobs will loose their glamour fairly quickly when it is realized how much work will be required, while others are out there having fun.  This is the nature of volunteer work.";"";"";
