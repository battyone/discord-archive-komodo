they are in a payments CC plan (this is what we are testing) you unlock them with the paymentsrelease RPC
any amount above 5M can be unlocked by any person once they are avalible (1460 blocks, after the last snapshot)
the first snapshot will be in like a few hours I think... because there are not may address im not sure what will happen it may even crash it. :joy:
but there are not yet any funds. those will be paid the same block the snapshot happens, and ready to be paid out in 1460 blocks, 20 blocks after the next snapshot```";"";"";

That I think its mostly the game side of it. 10M coins are avalible, 20 blocks after the snapshot. However you can release only half of these effectivly locking the other half until the next snapshot (or slightly after it, as anything in payments plan is locked for 1460 blocks aftert being sent)
I think we may need some kind of rich list, you can call getsnapshot at any height youself but its a lot of data to digest in JSON format lol
especally with 3999 addresses
