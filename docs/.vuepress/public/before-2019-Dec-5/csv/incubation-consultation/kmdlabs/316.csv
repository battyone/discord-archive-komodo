"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"01-Mar-19 10:55 AM";"```I dont think we need to chagne iguana for this, just return an error to it instead of null to that it will not create the notarization. If there are changes needed for iguana
I can do that
So what it needs to do is:
1) check that there is more than 2 notarizations on a chain
2) if there is more than 2, refuse to submit null
3) if there are less than 2 submit null.
the issue is comming from a notarization not yet being confirmed on KMD when iguana makes the notarization. It must wait until the last notarization has been confirmed.
this is why when we increased notarization frequency number to 15 blocks everything ALWAYS works 100% of the time.```";"";"";
