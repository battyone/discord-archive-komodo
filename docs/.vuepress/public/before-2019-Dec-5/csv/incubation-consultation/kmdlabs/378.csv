Plan is 
```
 1. We announce a future BTC block height. This block's blockhash will act as entropy for the lottery. 
2. Participants entering the lottery will post some data to an oracle prior to the block happening. 
2.5* participants must post a signed message from the same key to discord/github
3. We do sha256(blockhash+participant_data) (maybe sha256(sha256(blockhash)+participant_data) ?) 
4. Whichever 2 participants are closest to 0 get the open spot.
```
We plan to use this mechanism to choose our notaries. So if we have 5 people that want a position and only 2 open positions.";"";"";

Last snapshot will be at block: 11,520. The balances at this block height are the ones I used for top 3 rankings. You can still get these by just running the script before the next snapshot happens. 
The elegibility for a participation award were: ` If your balance has not been split for the airdrop @ 8640, you do not get anything`
To check this, start the chain on fresh sync, with -stopat=8650 for example, then run the script. This will give you the tio 20 address at block 8640 daily snapshot height, It rewinds backwards from this block height to the last notarized height. Its  not a snapshot at this exact height.";"";"";
