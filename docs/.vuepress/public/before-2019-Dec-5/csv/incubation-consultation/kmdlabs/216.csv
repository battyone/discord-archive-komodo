"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:27 AM";"no curentl;y not...  the proiblem is that CC contracts all use -pubkey to determine your working address

"202999072519356416";"NutellaLicka#4241";"12-Jan-19 05:29 AM";"Ah right, so you'd just have to manually import other addresses if you wanted to";"";"";

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:29 AM";"yes, but its not really recomended to do so if dealing with CC's just use the one address.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:30 AM";"maybe you could have multiple config.inis and restart if diffrent address's were needed?";"";"";

"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:30 AM";"I think that would work... your balance would show incoprrectly, because of other address's but it should still work.";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:31 AM";"for CC's yes pretty much.... I dont see an easy way of fixing that its a pretty low level thing for CCs that it uses -pubkey";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"12-Jan-19 05:33 AM";"Maybe my RPC can be unlocked to allow changing -pubkey in runtime... but I really dont think it will be safe... once it has been set lots of things assume it to never changes.";"";"";
