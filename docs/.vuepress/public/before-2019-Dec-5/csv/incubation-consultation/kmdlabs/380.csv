Pushed some updates. Removed HOUND/DRAGON.
Also removed CFEKPAY as I merged payments updates in that hard fork it. No longer required I have the winners of the prize saved, and they are also in this Discord as a record. 
There are some changes that I thaught may stop some chains loading, but it didnt happen for me on either node. It would be great if anyone staking any chains could update to this version to test staker changes. I think just maybe I finally got it actually stable. Ie, it doesn't just break the wallet after a few days. *KMDLabs/komodo can stake any KMD AC, like OUR or ZEXO etc* 
Cant say for sure  though with out lots of testers. It would be good to get this stuff merged to KMD before the hard fork, as they are very good changes IMO, as long as I didnt break anything. 
Have kids this weekend so wont be around much, please DM me any bugs found directly so I dont miss them, and I will fix when I have time. 
Launch just around the corner. once again thanks to all who have helped, and congrats to all KMD NN winners. 😃";"";"👌 (7),🔥 (4),🚀 (1),labs (3)";
