good new and bad news
Bad news, we would like to delay launch..

Good news, we think we have a much better solution to the pay per notarization problem along with the buy pressure problem.

We wish we could have seen this earlier. We got the idea while looking at OUR. We realized how cool having a dynamic coinbase based on transactions within the block is. 

The idea here is that:
The notary pay per notarization will happen in the coinbase of the block the notarization is included in. The POW/POS rewards will remain unaffected, but additional vouts(and coins) will be added to the coinbase.

the 10% or 22%, whatever is decided will solely to paid for LABS->KMD notarizations. Notarizations on fungible chains will be paid for by the creator of the chain.

We will have two new ac_params, -ac_notarypay and -ac_dead. ac_notarypay is the amount the notary will receive in the coinbase transaction for each notarization made on the chain. ac_dead is blockheight at which the chain will die. Consensus rules will dictate that any height above this is invalid. ac_dead is required because the chain creator must pre pay notarization fees for the duration of the chain. We may look into ways of being able to ""refill"" these funds. The proposed mechanism right now is that chain creator will burn block 1 amount *and* notarization fee amount for the duration of the chain. The amount burned for notarization fees will then slowly be recreated by each notarization on the chain. Once this amount has been fully recreated, the chain must die.(or fees refilled, but this could be complicated)

By requiring every fungible chain to have ac_notarypay, we can allow notaries to choose whether or not they will notarize a chain based on ac_notarypay amount. We hope this will lead to a free market for notarization fees for fungible chains.

If you guys are on board with this, we will solely prioritize this feature and launch as soon as we believe it's stable.";"";"üí° (1)";
