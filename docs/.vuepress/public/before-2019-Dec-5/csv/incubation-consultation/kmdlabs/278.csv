So I made it so that if it creates a block with an invalid notarisation it flags the txid as invalid to a static variable. CreateBlock can only be called in lock cs_main so if it tries to create one block and it fails, it then saves the txid, and next time it tries to create the block it adds the out of order notarisation as a normal tx but does not create the coinbase.";"";"👍🏽 (1)";

I dont relly understand why it does what it does 😆 
But this is the best thing I can come up with. It will flag the notarisation tx as invalid then create and mine a new block without it, then if for some reason that notarisation is then valid after it mines the block (dont understand how this happens but it did) it will reject that block and try to mine a block with the notarisation again. Really strange... The only other option it so have it not include the notarisation, whcih seems dangerous  for MoMoM we really need every notarisation on chain to prevent gaps.";"";"";
