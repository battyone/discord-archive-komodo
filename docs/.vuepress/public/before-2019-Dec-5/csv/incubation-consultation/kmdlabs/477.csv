Hello,

We are in the process of performing infrastructure upgrades, and this process will require us to migrate your instance to another hardware host node as these upgrades are performed.

Due to the size of the referenced instance, an offline migration will be necessary.

Please update this ticket to let us know when would be best to proceed. If we are able to perform this migration at any time, please also let us know

If we do not hear from you within 48 hours, the process will be automatically performed, and the instance will be powered down until the task is complete.

Instances of this size typically take 1 to 3 hours to complete migration.

We appreciate you choosing Vultr!```";"";"";

Please `./stop.sh` and `./start.sh` 
To replace CFEMMYLO9 with CFEKOD which is an ondemand chain that should notarize the same as a KMD on demand chain like SUPERNET etc.  
There are also consensus updates to iguana, to remove ban for detecting bad/spent utxos being sent.  I need to work out how to trigger the detection in a controlled way at some point to test it. For now though we are interested in the frequency of notarizations. I have changed it so that it does not abort a notarization if the next block height arrives before the previous finishes. It now waits until a notarization has been been sucessful, then aborts any rounds still running that were for a block before this. 
To test we need to alternate fast and slow block times, so cycle hash rate on and off.";"";"👍🏼 (7),☑ (6)";
