The global defaults to equihash.. 
Ideally we only want to set the min diff in the staking loops, which is only used 3 times in `komodo_bitcoind.h` If we also set this int he miner, then we get the issue where it pins a CPU to calculate min PoW... by setting this lower in the ming loop its finds the blockmuch faster.";"";"";
