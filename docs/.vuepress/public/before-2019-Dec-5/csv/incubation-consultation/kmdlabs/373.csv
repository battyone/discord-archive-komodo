Anyone can use this chain to test the merge RPC. Just untar the tgz in ~/.komodo and then run komodod from this repo and branch: https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/tree/jl777
The goal, is to fund the payments plan with paymentsfund RPC, then merge and prevent a paymentsrelease or burn coins.
The merged utxos should lock for an extra 10 blocks, giving enough time to make a paymentsrelease, beofre someone merges again. Also try to send to another address and burn the coins.
