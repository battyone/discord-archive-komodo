@LabsAssistant  @PHBA2061  @Strob  
OK I got something up for you guys to play a bit easier. 
I hope these scripts make it easier to know what the goal is. Remeber that someone must actually do `paymentsrelease` for teh airdropp to happen, its is not automatic. ;)
Latest master is working with these scripts for me. I think if 2-3 more people actaully join in, I will make the cut off for the 10K LABS coin, prize in 4 days from now.. If people dont join I may extend this longer until they do. Buit leaving it will only lose you possible coins to win.";"";"ü§ñ (2),üëç (3),Komodo (2)";
