Last change to verify your pubkey here. This list is the ""master list"" everything is now generated from this list automatically, stopping human error, as that has been a massive issue since the start. Also you can all update to latest master with a ./stop.sh git pull and ./start.sh
This will activate ERA2 in approximatly 2H.. You will need to either cron start.sh to run just after the era activation time stamp of: 1542964044 or simply restart manually any time after this time. It think manually doing it will be best just in case there are any issues. For those of you using a 4GB VPS, please make sure it has a swap file, as daemons crash (KMD in particular, without one). 
It really does not matter if we stop notarising, there was no warning for this update, normally there will be at least a week notice before era change. I am convinced all current issues are just from missmatched pubkeys, so we just need to transaition to ERA2, and then see what happens, if it all corrects itself we will be fine to launch the newest test chain as planned on saturday at 10am UTC. 

Alright, I will update 2 nodes on the new version, which will mine and stake, if you dont surface soon, the whole network will fork, as your miners will be on the wrong protocol verison. Again this isnt an issue, we just need this to happen ASAP... OR we are getting delayed another week. If it breaks totally... we just start new chains tomorrow.";"";"üëç (5)";
