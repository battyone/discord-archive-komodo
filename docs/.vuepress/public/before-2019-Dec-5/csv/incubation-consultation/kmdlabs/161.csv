Diffrences between stakedkomodo and official komodo. This is from doing a diff against the source of FSM and StakedChain/komodo/master.

-> Protocol version/ diffrent notary pubkeys
-> Notary tx's for staked notaries are maximum priority in the miner by default.
-> Komodo seeds are disabled for staked chains
-> Wallet filter for staked notaries (this is complex and needs its own docs, basics are in StakedNotary readme.)

-> MoMoM diffrences to what has been merged to FSM (do you want any of this @jl777c )
Extra set pf pubkeys possible (part of this was libscotts code, some of it is mine to make dPoW also work)
Cant send a migrate from a chain to itself
Cant send more than 1 million coins at once (goes with max money change so that you cant send coins that can never be imported)

-> There is a fix in mining.cpp that fixes setgenerate after the verus merge. 
In official komodo you cannot decrease threads with setgenerate  with staked you can.

-> Added segid to getsnapshot";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"15-Dec-18 08:14 AM";"RPCs: 
-> getlastsegidstakes : gives a tally of stakes from chain tip back number of blocks you specify. Works better than get snapshot as you get an idea of what is actually being staked.
-> getiguanajson  : returns a valid JSON for the current ERA, so that iguana config is not seperate from komodod (saves human error whn changing keys and ports etc)
-> getnotarysendmany : returns a JSON object with all notary address's and the amount of coins specifed in input. Used for the notary stats and funding notaries.
-> cleanwallettransactions : this is in the readme, we know what it doesn. Patch is avalible for main net should anyone need this.
-> some changes to z_mergetoaddress (with the wallet filter I dont think these are needed and might just take it out)

Also there are ERA's: 
These just mean the notary pubkey arrays are in a 3 dimentional array so its much easier to have many many arrays and juts loop over them, makes changing keys very easy. Code much simpler and easier to follow. 

There is also a function in one of the komodo_.h files where on block receive it figures out what era its in, and creates an array of Raddress's into a global var, only updating the array after the era has finished. This allows the miner priotity to work across ERA's and also the code for the PIRATE exception can work like this. But I have not tested that, maybe its not accurate enough for such a consensus change.";"";"";
