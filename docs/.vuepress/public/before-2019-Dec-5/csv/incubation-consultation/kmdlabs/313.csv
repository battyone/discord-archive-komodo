``` Time to try this. No idea if it will work, which is why I am changing port on iguana to 9998. Instructions:
1) sudo ufw allow 9998
2) ./stop.sh
3) ./start.sh -reindex
This is a major update to how MoMoM and dPoW work, the daemon especally for KMD, should use a fair bit less ram now. I dont know if this will fix the migrate problem, but it certainly can't hurt it and remvoes a variable allowing us to test further. 
```";"";"";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"28-Feb-19 11:16 AM";"The rest of the tests will be on my own branch and node. The plan is to log every tx that iguana sends, then also log every notarization added to the MoMoM database. 
I can then compare sent notarizations with notarizations added to the chain. If this step doesnt show up anything meaningful then I dont know how to fix it. 
If this test shows that notarizations are missing, then we simply need to change the ScanNotarizationsDB function to only return notarizations that are notarized. This prevents reorgs losing notarizations from the chain.,m and means the MoM depth is  reliable to be correct 100% of time.";"";"";
