For those who care, I wrote this last night before bed, was thinking about it all day while driving to the city. Went a back way that was about 1.5H longer lol, but it was a really nice drive though all this country with riversand hills. Really good day, 
Basically, how it works is this:
1) On the first withdraw an object is created that contains the winner, before any bets have been spent from the game address, and after a result can be calculated, we can use the withdraw RPC to calculate the winner, Then in validation the exact same function is called to verify that the correct winner was added into this object. 
2) next withdraw and all withdraws after this, simply spend the withdraw vout, into a new vout with the same object. 
3) The validation simply hashes this object from the vin, and the vout  and compares they are the same. So we know that its is valid. 
3) This means, that we can have 1 ticket with a fixed price if needed now, because even if there is say a million tickets have been sold or even a billion lol, the validation only needs to run once, and then the winner can just keep withdrawing over and over to merge the tickets and spend them to their specified pubkey. The overhead after the first withdraw is very low, and shouldnt slow all nodes down while the winner is extracting their funds.";"";"🚀 (3)";
"232679450301431808";"blackjok3r#3181";"08-Jul-19 01:49 AM";"I had to do it this way, because once some of the, utxos have been claimed from the game address, then the function I made that calculates the winner cant work, because it uses all the unspents in the game address. I think this will work, but its never been done before, I couldnt even see in VRSC pbass if miket did anything like this. Maybe their validation will do it, but as it hasnt been written yet I'm not sure. 
We are pretty close ot being able to start a chain on this branch, and put it into the CFEFEK cluster, because that chain has intesne supply of coins. 

The only thing Im not sure about is the function that calculates the winner, it may not actually work as intended. But as its just 1 function, we can change this easily to something elseif the algo for calculating the winner is not right.";"";"";

      Hi, there. I’m inviting you to make a 5 KMD swap in exchange for 200 LABS through Barterlly Escrow swaps. It’s the safest way for people that just want to make quick OTC swaps.
      If you want to go through with the swap you need to accept it and follow the instructions on http://app.barterlly.io/invite/8966

I don't know if there is a huge difference. I'll tell you in few hours/days if I encounter the same problem. I hope that the 'mining fix' did fix my problem. Thank you for your time";"";"👍 (1)";
