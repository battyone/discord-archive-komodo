create block is called
deamon is locked until block is created
during this process near teh end of create block the staking loop is called
the staking loop takes up to 10-25 even 30s to complete
dureing this time the deamon is locked
no RPC calls no block received nothing, locked.

what happens now
Create blcok is called
half way though the process the deamon lock is relaesed and the staking loop is called";"";"";
