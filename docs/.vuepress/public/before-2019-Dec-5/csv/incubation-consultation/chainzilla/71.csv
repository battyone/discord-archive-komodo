designed to prevent governments from acting with impunity behind the opacity of the old system.
The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they allow, through transparency, to avoid all those misunderstandings
that inevitably lead to corruption. I know very closely the case of crypto called ""Petro"" which was launched
by the Venezuelan government (Yes, that government who took practically the most rich country of the world into
an economic-ruin of almost 1 million percent inflation this year) in an attempt to evade the US economic sanctions.
But it didn't take too long for the fallacies of this project to be exposed: Lack of information about how to
buy it or exchange it, a not clear and totally unprofessional whitepaper, anyone knows how will be the crypto-oil
link as they have said that the coins will be backed in real oil reserves, and even the block explorer is not working
correctly. In a recent announcement of the Venezuela's government they stated that ""only the ones who purchases Petro before December 31 can convert it to any other digital currency"" as if they were going to regulate who and when
can the coins be exchanged.";"";"";
