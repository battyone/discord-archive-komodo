#kmdice KMDICE is a blockchain that has dice implemented and has done a lot of testing, might be nice to point that out

`"Foreteller" - guess a card game based on DiceCC`

52 cards deck guessing game. 

Using DiceCC RNG as a main one which affect a game result and non on-chain RNG just for result visual representation.

Game modes:

1) Guess a suit: choose a spade, club, diamond or heart (actually placing a bet with odds 3 - 1:4)

2) Guess a card value: choose 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (actually placing a  bet with odds 12 - 1:13)

3) Guess a card: choose exact card value + suit (actually placing a  bet with odds 51 - 1:52)

If diceCC bet result "won" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which match player prediction

If diceCC bet result "loss" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which not match player prediction

cool idea! using the odds to generate a new game play

[28-Jan-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks for feedback! @Meyse made some cool graphics and I'll try to implement it in Python GUI in a next few weeks. I have all betplacing GUI logic implemented already as part of previous plays (table choosing / creation, buttons, odds choosing sliders and etc) - just have to make proper layout mostly

@TonyL  that would be great for parapsychology research

[13-Mar-19 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@polycryptoblog Apophenia yeaah

[13-Mar-19 05:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol sorry was reading the card guessing thing and typed it before scrolling to bottom

[13-Mar-19 05:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But in general you're correct - players will start to guess will be next black by previous amount of reds and other apophenia stuff üòÉ

[13-Mar-19 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
But in reality everything is predetermined

[13-Mar-19 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Not predetermined only in player mind

[13-Mar-19 05:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It seems it would work well as a standardized tool to collect data and prevent fraud in the results and to id a player anonymously if there is a ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù I am a determinist too, for the most part but have run into things I couldn‚Äôt explain so the strange stuff of parapsychology intrigued me  .

[13-Mar-19 05:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Clue is that diceCC returning only won or lose but GUI can wrap this result to specific card/color so player can start to build systems or something

[13-Mar-19 05:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be interesting stuff yep, sad that I have other things in priority at the moment but as I know GUI for this game is in work by @Meyse

the kmdice project and this cc-dice project? Are they one and the same or am I misunderstsnding? It seems like the kmdice channel is more technical and covers mining while this channel covers gameplay UI?

[18-Mar-19 05:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Kmdice is DiceCC testchain with bounty funds locked in DiceCC betting plan (as far as I know).
This channel is for dice cryptoconditions consensus module discussing.

[21-Mar-19 03:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
Quick question, I want to avoid stepping on someone's toes, is anyone focused on  a sports-betting app?  or cc-bet?

[23-Mar-19 07:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@NNoperator yes, actually multiple.

[23-Mar-19 07:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but dont let that stop you.

[23-Mar-19 09:01 AM] Monetashi#8770
Hai @NNoperator what are you thinking about in the realm of sportsbetting. At the moment I am also brainstorming on something to do with/on komodo

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Mylo#8306
haha....we all like numbers üòÉ

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] NNoperator#3835
We need to add major betting sports that ZenSports (and others) isn't already covering.  I would like to see if we could make a mobile betting app that could  cover Japanese cycling races  (Keirin ).  It is one of the largest betting sports in Japan, a nation that bets more on sports than any other.

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Mylo#8306
plz put me down as an official tester of tennis betting app üòÉ

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Mylo#8306

[23-Mar-19 01:41 PM] NNoperator#3835
cc-bet is getting up there in priority,  so it would be good to start hashing out some of our brainstorming ideas and see what others think of them.

[29-Mar-19 12:31 AM] PHBA2061#2530
hi, I was going through the cc-dice documents, I think there is a little mistake at https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-dice.html#dicefund 
the arguments order should be `minbet` then `maxbet`

[05-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo dealer must do it before timeout

[05-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
after timeout, I'm not sure if bettor must do it or anyone can do it

[05-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
`The dicefinish method rebroadcasts a bet that was previously broadcast.` this is wrong though I believe

[05-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
dicefinish is when dealer reveals entropy and whether or not it was a win/lose, so not everyone can do that

[05-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
if dealer doesn't do it within timeout timeframe, bettor gets a default win if the bettor does dicefinish

[05-Apr-19 02:46 AM] Mylo#8306
ok tahnks

question: if I want to make a bet with `dicebet` on KMDICE, what should I provide as argument  for the name of the dice contract ?
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/dice.html#dicebet>

[18-Oct-19 09:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 someone needs to use 
```
dicefund name funds minbet maxbet maxodds timeoutblocks
```
to create a contract first (i.e. atleast 2 nodes are needed)

then you can use those details to place bets

[18-Oct-19 09:26 AM] gcharang#6833
oh, you mentioned KMDICE!

[18-Oct-19 09:26 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, do we have contracts already deployed on KMDICE ?

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Dice CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page.

[03-Nov-19 10:42 PM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar, KMDICE (kmdice.bet) was built on this Module. Will check their latest GUI in #kmdice .
This is one of the first CCs we tested and SMK made the first TUI.  TonyL also has a TUI, and possibly a GUI.
