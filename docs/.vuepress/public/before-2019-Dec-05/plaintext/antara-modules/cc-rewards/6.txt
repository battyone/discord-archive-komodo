Is the lottery module something that's available in CC yet?

[30-May-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure loto is working or not, but I did work out how to make it very easily using future MoMoM hashes.

[30-May-19 03:01 PM] PTYX#6840
I was playing with the idea of adding a section in chameleon so that users could input 0.1 KMD and get a "ticket".  Then when the pot reaches a certain amount it does a random payout.

[30-May-19 03:01 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't know how feasible that is though at the moment with the CC. I'd like it to be KMD based.

what's the smallest mindays locktime for rewards?   1 day is pretty long for testing.  does it accept values lower than 1?

[11-Jun-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
0

[11-Jun-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could edit source code to set some smaller amount, because internally its in seconds

[11-Jun-19 03:46 PM] Mylo#8306
ok - sounds like a plan thanks

```- Rewards
  - Insert Rewards CC proof of concept here - [link]```

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Rewards CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good and also if you have a coin using it!

[04-Nov-19 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
THC uses it in production @Regnar
