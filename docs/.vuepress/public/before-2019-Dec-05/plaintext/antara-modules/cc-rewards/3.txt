`if ( !CheckTxFee(tx, PAYMENTS_TXFEE, chainActive.LastTip()->GetHeight(), chainActive.LastTip()->nTime) )`
`return eval->Invalid("txfee is too high");`

[26-Mar-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
works just as expected üòÑ

[26-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Alright#0419
comment that while you're at it? üôè

[26-Mar-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty self explanitory man

[26-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Alright#0419
in particular `// validation for recover mode rewardsunlock` at least

[26-Mar-19 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the is a commetned out printf inside that function that gives you theb values for debugging

[26-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Alright#0419
and `// validation for rewardsunlock`

[26-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
had no idea what that was when I was first looking at it

[26-Mar-19 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
the recover mode validation

[26-Mar-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh ok yeah. I think this is for all rewards tx not just recover.

[26-Mar-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in any case I get ya. will do

[26-Mar-19 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
recover mode has entirely separate validation unless you put the checks before the recover mode if

[26-Mar-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this new check is before

[26-Mar-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now need to add the extra vout

[26-Mar-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to prevent anyone claiming... minrelease I think also should be easy, unless I cannot safly call rewards calc earlier

[26-Mar-19 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I made it work, at least half way there... It appears it lets me just keep claiming it over and and over though lol... free money

[26-Mar-19 12:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah something seems quite wrong here lol... Its let me claim the entrie rewards balance to a single p[ubkey even though I added them from 2 diffrent ones... Or at least I think I did ü§î

Can you please test this? I thiunk there is still something else wrong with it. Maybe I screwed up the test of it? It appears that it will let anyone just take all the funds in the plan, provided they locked at least some.

Not sure why as I really dont know how the rewards CC works

[26-Mar-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if it was already like that or what.

[26-Mar-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant use the PAY chain as this branch no longer syncs it.

[26-Mar-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
all the locked utxo needs to be validated it is for the same dest pubkey

[26-Mar-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but since we are doing just one utxo at a time, it seems hard to mix them?

[26-Mar-19 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont know I think because I was only using a single node to make the plan and also lock funds, I think it let me calim the funding also

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I really need someone who knows what they are doing to test this

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I also solved minrelease issuse too about to push it

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TonyL#3577
In unittests I'm trying to claim "not mine" rewards from other node and it throw error

[26-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TonyL#3577
If it's a clue

[26-Mar-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to recheck this matter because made long time ago

[26-Mar-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah maybe those tests were already broken with recover tx, as it was fairly broken to begin with.

[26-Mar-19 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure, as I say not familiar with how rewards works exactly...

[26-Mar-19 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181

I know for a fact that claiming with a pubkey that I didnt use to lock, or fund any plans would not let me do it, which was what I was asked to do... but it seems maybe something else was/is broken

[26-Mar-19 01:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just checked - current unit tests for rewards not covering much.  It's only creating rewards plan, then trying to unlock it from same node and excepting error because rewards amount less than txfee.

[26-Mar-19 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well I tried to start a chain but I cant build my repo/branch right now... `ccache` or something is refusing to DL with build.sh

[26-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
submitted PR hopefully someone tests it while im asleep and I can fix whatever is left tmorrow

[26-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
What is the exact problem at the moment?

[26-Mar-19 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really know tbh ... There was 2 problems:

[26-Mar-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1) miner could change tx fee and steal all the funds from global CC address, this problem is fixed.

[26-Mar-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2) you could lock funds and then there were not enough funcding to claim the reward

[26-Mar-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This allowed anyone to just keep on unlockign all funds, no amtter if they locked them or the minrelease had passed

[26-Mar-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just constantly unlock as soon as funds were locked

[26-Mar-19 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, sabotage

[26-Mar-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have made it so that now only if you unlock funds you locked (pubkey limited) that you can unlock and it *should* respect minrelease seconds now

[26-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that im not 100% on, as the RPC takes min days not seconds ...

[26-Mar-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so it was quite hard to test

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, nice point to retest it and update unit-tests üòÉ Just realised that they were written when framework was only with single node

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
```        assert_equal(result['minseconds'], 0)
assert_equal(result['maxseconds'], 864000)```

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I wonder it's seconds

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did only put 0 for min pretty sure RPC help says days

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but internally its seconds

[26-Mar-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like to create the plan its in days not seconds

[26-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah I see

[26-Mar-19 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
mindays maxdays on funding creation yes

[27-Mar-19 07:19 PM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/3Ft8JTrcyv/ cant unlock now from any node after locking

[27-Mar-19 07:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Typo in last call (rewardsplan duplicated)
Actual call is:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL14 rewardsunlock TONYL a0ae12ac1d50801873e33ea0dd2c2331346e87005079f7793ba9bed4159edaec e5f92fc2d9c2e2b52c02671c9a92acf9a021e5c9d9b0206629934719f8be8273
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "reward 0 is <= the transaction fee"
}
```

[27-Mar-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
But when reward is claimable - it was done by design as I remember that anybody can unlock it

[27-Mar-19 07:34 PM] TonyL#3577
```One twist that makes it a bit unexpected is that anybody should be able to unlock the funds that were locked, as long as it ends up in the locking address. The reason for this is that SPV servers want to be supported and while locking can be done via normal sendrawtransaction, it requires a native node to do the unlocking. By allowing anybody to be able to unlock, then there can be a special node that unlocks all locked funds when they are ready. This way, from the user's point of view, they lock the funds and after it is matured, it reappears in their wallet.```

[28-Mar-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a bug in new rewards?

[28-Mar-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
old bug

[28-Mar-19 07:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it never checked if minrelease had passed at all in validation

[28-Mar-19 07:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just unlocked with 0 rewards

[28-Mar-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`CC Eval EVAL_REWARDS Invalid: no elegible rewards spending tx 3f13dfdd13a9119f57b101d445c8264b436dac0808853bd2bcc1ddde8f30b529` 
moved some things around so that it now does this if the reward is calcualted as 0.

[28-Mar-19 07:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also should have the effect of recover tx not being able to be done unlesss there is a reward actually avalible

[28-Mar-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the mainstream functionality is still working and new errors are actually valid errors

[28-Mar-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how it used minrelease wa a ccduration, for calcualting how mcuh rewards are there, and if the minrelese was not met, then it returned 0.

[28-Mar-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but validation did not check that reward was zero and invalidate

[28-Mar-19 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it just allowed reward to be zero

[28-Mar-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you could unlock the plan before minrelease time... This is what I was saying the other day, but I worked out how to fix it.

[28-Mar-19 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless it of course broken something else

[28-Mar-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
just making sure nothing that should be working broke, i didnt understand tonyL bug

[28-Mar-19 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright is testing it at the moment I pushed some more fixes to my repo. Havent heard back from him yet, but the block he said contained the erronous tx in it will not validate with my fixes.

[28-Mar-19 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely any chain with rewards CC will hard fork from this I would say we need to be careful

[28-Mar-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to do a resync test

[28-Mar-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe timestamp activate the fix

[28-Mar-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i like the idea of timestamp activating such risky consensus changes

[28-Mar-19 07:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its a good idea. I used a timestamp activation for LABS notary era's seems to work ok... BUt Ithink the sapling code is safer to use than my hack of invalidating all blocks until the time from future time is past.

[28-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if the blocktimestamp is used against a future activation timestamp, that seems safe enough. the problem with sapling was that it couldnt go on and off and on again without making all sorts of problems, so I had to latch it

[28-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as we update the field before the fix activates, then it is not a problem

also there is a typo there

[28-Mar-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that might happen

[28-Mar-19 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it may need a diffrent way to flag minrelease

[28-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[28-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its fine ... reward calc doesnt actually look for utxos... its only checking duration

[28-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You will need to wait until duration has passed minrelease to claim your recover

[28-Mar-19 08:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[28-Mar-19 08:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
leaving PR closed as it will take at least a day for you to lock coins long enough to test it.

I made a plan with 0 minrelease

[28-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
Can recover mode *only* work if there is not enough funding?

doesn't seem to work like that
