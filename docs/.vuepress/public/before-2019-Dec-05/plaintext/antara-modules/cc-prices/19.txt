Yes. I already released some funds yesterday and that worked fine.

[16-May-19 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Payments cc has been passed to gcharang and hopefully alright to test when he gets home. I'm 99% sure its good. I have confirmed snapshot height is correct and we ran chain with 20 nodes for 5 days, all seemed to agree on snapshot perfectly.

[16-May-19 08:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Great! Have to re-test `-ac_stocks` and can start 24 hours delay `BETS0` chain today I wonder

[16-May-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it possible to change `-ac_prices` and `-ac_stocks` parameters of chain "on fly" after chain creation or new chain needs to be created each time when you want to change these params?
Not totally understand how nodes come to consensus of which pairs are allowed to trade on this chain

[16-May-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
they are ac parameters, to change it is to change the chain

[16-May-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
choose wisely

[16-May-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there has to be a minimum payout, otherwise the largest address can attack by doing payments release at max frequency

[16-May-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
There is a `"minrelease": 10.00000000` param of payment plan

[16-May-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just hard to predict some fine values now because value/common denomination of BETS0 coin is unknown atm

[16-May-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder on BETS0 we can test things and make estimates/notes for BETS1 
Since it will be chain with almost 0 emission all depends of BETS "mother" coin üòÉ

[16-May-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-May-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
`-ac_stocks` without space working fine

[16-May-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
likely -ac_prices would too, so might be less confusing to never have space

[16-May-19 11:42 AM] TonyL#3577

be careful with adding the more obscure ones as if they get delisted, then the chain will stall

[16-May-19 11:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh dunno what is in CZ mind üò¶  
Will remove BCC, BCHABC and TRX from list above so as these assets in my personal risk zone

[16-May-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
funny idea

[16-May-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
So proposed chain params are:
```./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_cc=10777 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_supply=7777  -ac_blocktime=300 -ac_snapshot=288 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237
```
Crypto tickers:
`-ac_prices="ETH,LTC,BNB,NEO,LRC,QTUM,OMG,ZRX,STRAT,IOTA,XVG,KMD,EOS,ZEC,DASH,XRP,STORJ,XMR,BAT,BTS,LSK,ADA,WAVES,STEEM,RVN,DCR,XEM,ICX, HOT,ENJ"`
Stock tickers:
`-ac_stocks="AAPL,ADBE,ADSK,AKAM,AMD,AMZN,ATVI,BB,CDW,CRM,CSCO,CYBR,DBX,EA,FB,GDDY,GOOG,GRMN,GSAT,HPQ,IBM,INFY,INTC,INTU,JNPR,MSFT,MSI,MU,MXL,NATI,NCR,NFLX,NTAP,NVDA,ORCL,PANW,PYPL,QCOM,RHT,S,SHOP,SNAP,SPOT,SYMC,SYNA,T,TRIP,TWTR,TXN,VMW,VOD,VRSN,VZ,WDC,XRX,YELP,YNDX,ZEN,XAU,XAG,XPT,XPD,DJIA,SPX,NDX,VIX,BRK.A"`

and -earlytxid of airdrop plan with such params:
 `paymentsairdrop '[576,100,0,3999,0,0]'`

What should mean funds unlock every 576 blocks (~each two 48 hours) with snapshot every 288 blocks (~once in 24 hours) with 100 coins in fees minrelease for up to 3999 top BETS0 holders wallets

[16-May-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think `ac_snapshot` sshould be 288 blocks. U300s block time makes 288 blocks per day?  Doing it too often is not a good idea...

[16-May-19 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, should be 288 blocks per day

[16-May-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maturing should be 288 as well I wonder

[16-May-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
If maturing is faster than snapshot it looks not fair

[16-May-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
snapshot just determines who ranks on rich list... It shouldnt really change much each day...

[16-May-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess with a chain with basically 0 balacne on it though.... ü§î

[16-May-19 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can just make lockedblocks 2x288 
So it takes 2 days, before any fees can be paid out.

Removed ac_perc - was not correct and more than block reward.  I will just fund house from `-ac_supply=7777` since we have RPC call for it anow and left myself few coins to test

@jl777c Is `BETS` chain in `-ac_cc=10777` cluster?

[16-May-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
cluster is ok, doesnt matter until notarized

[16-May-19 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Great, so will start such chain now. ~2 days should take data accumulation for smoothed prices, then on Sunday I'll test and then prepare interface multiOS bundles if betting works fine

[16-May-19 02:04 PM] dimxy#2587
I have read some more about how betting works. Probably we may improve something in prices.
First, how to find opposite positions which cancel out each other. Now I use very simple algorithm just searching explicit opposites like BTC_USD vs BTC_USD,!
I understand real betting brokers calculate correlation between prices for some period which allows to compare different prices.
(BTW we earlier discussed that XYZ_BTC cancels out BTC_ABC but now I see we could take into account the correlation between those prices)
So we might calculate a correlation matrix between prices for some period and use to better define cancelling positions (like EUR_USD vs USD_GBP). 
I think this would even allow to oppose complex synthetics (what we now do not yet)
 
Second, about risk management. Seems betting companies have several strategies. For instance, there are two kinds of orderbooks, A and B. 
As I understood orders in B book are just opposite positions betting against each other, that involves now risk for the house.
But if there are many positions betting in the same direction the house can go on real markets with these funds taking off risks from itself (with A book orders).
Seems we cannot use such strategy in prices cc? That is all we can do is just stop accepting bets if risks of losses for the house are too high, as in this case the house actually bets against the bettors.

[16-May-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there can be a special bet that allows anybody to fund the opposite positions

[16-May-19 02:53 PM] dimxy#2587
If such bets exist could it be an impression for a bettor that the house actually persuades him to make some kinds of bets? (seems betting companies do not disclose made bets publicly)

[16-May-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
just an idea that allows active balancing

[16-May-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not for, or against it

[16-May-19 03:03 PM] dimxy#2587
I have now a rpc that allows a bettor to list all positions grouped by their symbols and up/down sign and where he could find an opposite position and available amount

[16-May-19 03:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Add corellation matrix approach in spot of risk management is definetly very interesting direction for house involvement

[16-May-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
But to build reliable corellation matrix which really means something you need really good sampling depth

[16-May-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Few years lets say

[16-May-19 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
And here there will be little difficulties because different coins were overlaid at different times

[16-May-19 03:51 PM] TonyL#3577
In general I think I can make some pilot API (or can do it as script) on top of Binance API (and also can combine it with stocks if needed) which will return corellation matrix for needed pairs. So pricesCC will able to just call this API and use data

[16-May-19 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Things with significant positive corellation we will be able to consider as same thing (in spot of risks) and it should simplify life

[16-May-19 03:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm for large synthetics we can make some algo based on corellation as well:
Lets say player opened position for synthetic with 3 elements - we can find  most negative corellation (between these prices datasets) "opposite" 3 elements combination and add it as  "recommended" opossite position with discount fee

[16-May-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if it has 3 elements, likely parts of if cancel out

[16-May-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
what is important is the NET exposure

[16-May-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
total amount long BTC, short BTC

[16-May-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
long USD, short USD, ...

[16-May-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the net amount is the risk exposure to each coin

[16-May-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so any bet that reduces the overall exposure is reducing risk and should be incentivized

[16-May-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
any bet that increases the overall exposure is increasing risk and should be de-incentivized

[16-May-19 04:04 PM] TonyL#3577
In cmc top100 99% of things have strong positive corelllation

[16-May-19 04:04 PM] TonyL#3577
So to simplify we can actually just abstract to crypto longs/shorts balance

[16-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
that can be a secondary aspect, but it shouldnt be primary

[16-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
statistical correlation usually works

[16-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
usually

[16-May-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it isnt a delta neutral portfolio, there is exposure, regardless of historical correlation

[16-May-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you think that no single crypto will outperform the others

[16-May-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or underperform

[16-May-19 04:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway from past numbers you can take only "usually" cases because you can't know feature
For BTC_USD USD_BTC it's clear how to make 0 risk portfolio, yes

[16-May-19 04:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But if I open position: BTC_USD + some stable pair (USD/CHF let's say) - it's a different case already

[16-May-19 04:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, maybe from huge synthetic just specify most volatile one

[16-May-19 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Beside of pairs corellation in spot of risks we should concider volatility: so if BTC_USD have lets say 3%/day avg volatility - Apple stocks move 0.3%/day everage and risks for house different (numbers just from head)

[16-May-19 04:14 PM] TonyL#3577
On Bitmex I can take x100 leverage for BTC but for some EOS or ADA only x20 - it's because of different volatility and trade volumes. Maybe we have to make similar leverage caps for different markets

[16-May-19 04:16 PM] dimxy#2587
I think for different markets should be different correlation matrixes, sure

[16-May-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I mean not corellation but volatility. Corellation matrixes we can build for everything actually, actually yes statistical corellation its how things did in past and "usually" (means maybe) it will behave same way in future. It might be some third circle of defence: 

Simpliest "first circle of defense" - less leverage on more volatile things
Second circle is to try balance things like BTC_USD USD_BTC (in long synthetics can balance most volatile components) - by dynamic maximal allowed leverage (similar to bookmakers float coefficients)
Third circle might be some statistical methods like corellation matrixes or common components analysis lets say - if Microsoft stocks corelates with BTCSV_BTC - we can try to balance these things and etc

[16-May-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Moreover I think there is one possibility which we not considered yet - fund can place bets as well

[16-May-19 04:25 PM] dimxy#2587
As I understood it when a bettor places a bet and the fund does not enter real market with this amount, it actually means this bettor is against the fund: if he wins the fund loses and pays its money.
And of course no an opposite bet

[16-May-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I just had some crazy idea with risks balancing by automated crypto purchasing. Hedging and etc

[16-May-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577

[16-May-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i suggested having a way to take on the opposite positions

[16-May-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
then specific nodes can actively try to balance things

[16-May-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577

[16-May-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
