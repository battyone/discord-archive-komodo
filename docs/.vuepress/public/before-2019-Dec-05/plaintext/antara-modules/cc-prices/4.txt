with 100x leverage a 1% drop will wipeout the bet

[18-Apr-19 07:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[18-Apr-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but the leverage is fixed

[18-Apr-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the total amount just prevents you from being rekt

[18-Apr-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is enough

[18-Apr-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the price goes down by 0.9%, then you have a loss of 9

[18-Apr-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
0.1% more and you are rekt (maybe we put a bit of cushion there so 0.05% more and you are rekt)

[18-Apr-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you add another 10, then you can avoid being rekt for another 1% drop

[18-Apr-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so the bugs so far are costbasis is 0, leverage not used when calculating profits, bet amount is in satoshis instead of coins

[18-Apr-19 07:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[18-Apr-19 07:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm are `leverage 0` and `leverage 1` should be something different? 
Other words: am I understan correct that with leverage 0 I should be able to open position without leverage and 1 is leverage which doubling my bet?

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Just thought that leverage starts to count from `2` but was able to open position with `0` leverage so confused

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
leverage 0 should not be allowed

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so one more

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the profit formula is leverage * profit

[18-Apr-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so if leverage is 0 you wont ever have profits

[18-Apr-19 07:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, 1 should be without leverage and from 2 starting leverage, thats what I thought

[18-Apr-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
profit calc is based on percentage difference between current price and costbasis

[18-Apr-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Updated list :)
so the bugs so far are: `costbasis is 0, leverage not used when calculating profits, bet amount is in satoshis instead of coins, possible to create position with 0 leverage`

[18-Apr-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, and current price not displaying

[18-Apr-19 07:45 PM] dimxy#2587
there is a check for leverage in the code, mayb it does nt cover 0

[18-Apr-19 07:47 PM] dimxy#2587
about costbasis 
my understanding was that we can set costbasis after 24h when smoothed value might be calculated
was not sure what to set  to it before 24h
plus I now do not allow set costbasis before 24h pased from the bet height

[18-Apr-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not the permanent costbasis, but the temporary one

[18-Apr-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to be able to see the profit calculations before 24hrs

[18-Apr-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so the costbasis is always updated each block,until it is made permanent with a costbasis tx

[18-Apr-19 07:49 PM] dimxy#2587
probably we need to output that its permanent or not?

[18-Apr-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Apr-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
can list the costbasis txid if it has one

[18-Apr-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it doesnt, then it is temp

[18-Apr-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it will be exciting to see the profit calc change each block

[18-Apr-19 07:55 PM] dimxy#2587
about value formatting: 
we usually output coins in coins and tokens in satoshis. Here we re working with coins, maybe thats why satoshi were converted to coins?

[18-Apr-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the number was not converted to coins

[18-Apr-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
100 bet became 0.00000010

[18-Apr-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of 100.0

[18-Apr-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and we also need to add betting with tokens

[18-Apr-19 07:56 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1"```
creating position with `  "positionsize": 10.00000000,`

[18-Apr-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so an optional parameter or different rpc for token betting

[18-Apr-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1" <tokenid>

[18-Apr-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that would bet a billion tokens

[18-Apr-19 07:59 PM] dimxy#2587
so probably better to accept  amount as coins not satoshis (for coins case)?

[18-Apr-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for coins in floating point, for tokens in satoshis

[18-Apr-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that makes sense

[18-Apr-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
using one or two rpc calls

[18-Apr-19 08:49 PM] dimxy#2587
seems leverage  always deserialized as 0 from opreturn
no, it's deserialized okay

[18-Apr-19 10:24 PM] dimxy#2587
I changed profits calculations to double arithmetic. The existed variant caused overflow and loss of value.
updated the code in my repo

[19-Apr-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@dimxy, for display doubles is fine, but in consensus code it is non-deterministic so uint64_t will need to be used

[19-Apr-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what part of the equation overflowed and what is the current price that leads to profits of 100? that is 100% profit

[19-Apr-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
did you not subtract 1 from the currentprice/costbasis ?

[19-Apr-19 06:05 AM] dimxy#2587
this expression seems overflows when price=526272990000
((price * SATOSHIDEN) / costbasis) - SATOSHIDEN

[19-Apr-19 06:06 AM] dimxy#2587
for the second, actually now it calculates not profits/loss but closing price:
 return(positionsize + addedbets + profits);

[19-Apr-19 06:07 AM] dimxy#2587
we might return just profits instead

[19-Apr-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
"profits" should be just the profits

[19-Apr-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
return(positionsize + addedbets + profits);
that would be "equity"

[19-Apr-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and the current price needs to be in the JSON

[19-Apr-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
((price * SATOSHIDEN) / costbasis) - SATOSHIDEN ->

(((price/10000) * SATOSHIDEN) / (costbasis/10000)) - SATOSHIDEN

[19-Apr-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and actually instead of using 10000, use komodo_pricemult(ind)

{Reactions}
üëç 

[19-Apr-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the komodo_pricemult() is what to multiply the 32bit price to an 8 decimals satoshis based number

{Reactions}
üëå 

[19-Apr-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
for BTC/USD it only has 4 decimals precision, so it is multiplied by 10000

[19-Apr-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
for crypto prices it is already at 8 decimals precision, so multiplied by 1

[19-Apr-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
for forex currencies it is in 2 decimals, so multiplied by 1000000

[19-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
by reversing this scaling, it should always end up with something that fits in a uint32_t and that wont ever overflow

[19-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i think around 4000.0000 it overflows the 64 bits when multiplied by 100 mil

[19-Apr-19 06:17 AM] dimxy#2587
yes 526272990000* 100,000,000 =  52 604 650 000 000 000 000   
and max int64                                           =         9 223 372 036 854 770 000

[19-Apr-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
by dividing by 10000 we should be good for at least a few years before BTC price overflow

[19-Apr-19 06:18 AM] dimxy#2587
ok

[19-Apr-19 06:20 AM] dimxy#2587
Another issue might be with temp costbasis value:
actually how I calculate it now, it appears equal to firstprice value

[19-Apr-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
for long position, maximum price since the position was opened

[19-Apr-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
for short position, minimum price

{Reactions}
üëå 

[19-Apr-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if the price is continuing to go up, the the costbasis will be too and the profit is 0. this prevents using future knowlege of the 24 hr delay to gain instant profit

[19-Apr-19 06:34 AM] dimxy#2587
yes seems now I got this:
while we do not reach 24h for the proper costbasis calculation we should use max/min just for the available period < 24h

[19-Apr-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and the real cost basis is the last value at DAYWINDOW after the position is opened

[19-Apr-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of when the costbasis tx is issued. so once it is DAYWINDOW, then the cost basis doesnt change

[19-Apr-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but still during the first day, high leverage positions are watched very carefully and maybe more funds added

[19-Apr-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
which is good for the system as this is opposite of proper trading. you cut your losses short and ride your winners. but this looking at changing costbasis and equity, people cant help but put more money into losing positions

[19-Apr-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we do need to have actual traders use the system to see how things work at high margin, especially how much bankroll is needed.

[19-Apr-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
in case there isnt enough funds, i think we just socialize things and prorate the payouts by the total equity in the system

[19-Apr-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
we also need ways for equity to be able to be injected into the system, probably via some otherwise illegal synthetic "DONATION"

[19-Apr-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so many unspecified details to fill in to make a working system

[19-Apr-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but before getting sucked into all this, the pull request for the assets crosschain is needed

[19-Apr-19 06:42 AM] dimxy#2587
BTW for this kind of costbasis calculation I think we always would report zero or losses for time<24?
as costbasis always >= price for long and backwards for shorts

[19-Apr-19 06:46 AM] dimxy#2587
(for assets migration there is a tasks to do: get to a unified burn tx and import tx structure with coda and gateways import as those tx are shared)

[19-Apr-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
but what if the price drops?

[19-Apr-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes, 0 profits or losses

[19-Apr-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
that is fine, after all the first hours of the 24hr delay can be easily predicted as the history that will be used is already known

[19-Apr-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the best traders will start the 24hrs with a 0 loss position

[19-Apr-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810

I use komodo_getprice to get  correlated and smoothed price (and take them in [1] and [2] offsets of returned buffer)
I see it returns values with the lowest 4 digits filled with non-zero:
  "lastprice": 5262.82240206,

[19-Apr-19 08:30 AM] dimxy#2587
"lastprice": 5262.86241241,

[19-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, only the smoothed price should be used for costbasis calcs

[19-Apr-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it does get some fractional data, but overflow is not a good thing so we need to sacrifice them, it is a bit of false precision anyway

[19-Apr-19 08:48 AM] dimxy#2587
oh yes, it is from smoothed calculations

[19-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
correlated shouldnt have any extra precision

[19-Apr-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo @TonyL for REKT1 I want to make it a sidechain for BET, that will allow us to test it even without tokens betting support. Also it will test sidechains with real money at stake. I am hoping to integrate the snapshot payments CC -ac_script so the fees are blockchain enforced to go to coin hodlers, but i guess it is only for the BET that is deposited and converted to REKT1
