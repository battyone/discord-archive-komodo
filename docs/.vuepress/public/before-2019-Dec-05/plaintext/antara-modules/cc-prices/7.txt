ok, good idea to have a version that locks costbasis in 3 blocks to allow for fast testing

[19-Apr-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
`then we are good and it is a matter to tune the monetization, rekt percentages, limits on addingfunds?` - I tried only longs and only with BTC_USD pair so far

[19-Apr-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
So have to check what happens in case of shorts and create some indexes/synthetic pairs

[19-Apr-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
true, there could well be bugs in the synthetic construction, which needs to also be displayed in the JSON

[19-Apr-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems this is coming together pretty fast

once the basics are working, we can add token betting

[19-Apr-19 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
And some interface hehe üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
that too, but now you understand the game, i think you will have some good ideas for it

[19-Apr-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i think i know how to compensate for people adding funds

[19-Apr-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the more you add, the higher the rekt liquidation percentage is

[19-Apr-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point it wont help even to add more funds

[19-Apr-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this needs to be tuned a bit, but we can cancel out whatever advantage comes from being able to bail out bad positions with a lot of funds

[19-Apr-19 08:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Just realized what is missing in `pricesinfo` - construction which I used on bet / trading pair

[19-Apr-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the synthetic it represent

[19-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if normally -90% and you are rekt, if you addfunds equal to the initial bet, then maybe -80% and you are rekt

[19-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
add another and it is -70%

[19-Apr-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe not a linear thing, but that type of effect

[19-Apr-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so where the additional money you put at risk, it shouldnt change the odds to much, more a double or nothing proposition

[19-Apr-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
as you play this, think about where the rekt percentage would need to be for you to not add more funds

[19-Apr-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
probably we could model this mathematically... but i dont know how

[19-Apr-19 08:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Who will have control over "rekted" funds?

[19-Apr-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain

[19-Apr-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is where winners are paid from

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so as more and more people lose, bigger and bigger bets can be made

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so have to design it the way in which it's not drained

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] TonyL#3577
If it drained = game over üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
speaking of which, we need to be able to see globally how much has been bet and how much is at risk

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain deaded

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
well the game on the chain

[19-Apr-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody would need to give it CPR by adding funds

[19-Apr-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I think that chain coins will be "utility" more for such game

[19-Apr-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Some external assets peged to this coin and reflected on game chain will act as a value holders

[19-Apr-19 08:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Because if there is a risk of dead chain - unlikely there are reasons to have this chain coin itself value

[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the chain is a sidechain

[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, thats what I'm thinking about üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that already has value

[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why I want it to be a BET sidechain

[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
REKT0, REKT1, REKT2,... ,might all get bankrupted

[19-Apr-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but as we tune it we will get the right formula

[19-Apr-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
It's very interesting concept - instead of  many coins  creation with unclear value proect some valuable assets on it and use some chains as utility only

[19-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the real BET chain is the store of value

[19-Apr-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
these sidechains are experimental chains that once we tune it so it is fair but not going to bankrupt itself, then maybe the majority of BET will move to that instance of the sidechain

[19-Apr-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
even if the game is bankrupted, the BET coins are won by someone, who can just redeem to BET and deposit in the next REKTi chain

[19-Apr-19 08:42 PM] TonyL#3577
We can setup `BET` <-> `BET Token on REKT chain` gateways maybe

[19-Apr-19 08:42 PM] jorian#4555
üëÄ i read BET

[19-Apr-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
simpler just to have a sidechain

[19-Apr-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
also, this combines with the payments CC snapshot address that will collect the betting fees, so the holders of the REKT get the payouts whenever there is enough fees to fund a snapshot

{Reactions}
üí™ 

[19-Apr-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
at that point, then most all the BET should move into the sidechain

[19-Apr-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a self-sustaining game, the BET becomes a totally automated money making machine

[19-Apr-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Autonomous financial markets - very futuristc üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
I have a bit of a mundane question: how to open short?

[19-Apr-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, maybe minus before leverage

[19-Apr-19 08:48 PM] TonyL#3577
`"BTC_USD, 1"` - also am I understand correct that 1 means amount of pairs I've used?

[19-Apr-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
negative leverage

[19-Apr-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you need a weight to push the top of stack into the accumulator

[19-Apr-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
"BTC_USD, 1, BTC_EUR, 2"

[19-Apr-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that would weigh BTC_EUR price double that of BTC_USD

[19-Apr-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I see

[19-Apr-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
"BTC_USD, USD_JPY, *, 1, BTC_EUR, 2"

[19-Apr-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that would weigh BTC_EUR price double that of BTC_JPY

[19-Apr-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just like a calculator, push push, operator

[19-Apr-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810

just a typo in the print or is there some kind of time locking involved here?

[19-Apr-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i added it to the VRSC coinbase timelock validation function

it is a misnomer, but i assume anybody looking at such error messages will look at the source to figure things out

not sure the cost is right, there might be a bug in the synthetic

[19-Apr-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
to debug this, split the synthetic into each component part

[19-Apr-19 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC_JPY should be a very big number, maybe it overflowed...

[19-Apr-19 09:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that `"BTC_USD, USD_JPY, *, 1, BTC_EUR, 2"` =  0,3333333(3)* (BTC/JPY) + 0,666666(6) * (BTC/EUR) ?

[19-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, should be

[19-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
1 BTC_JPY + 2 BTC_EUR / 3

[19-Apr-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Why `1 BTC_JPY` - isnt weights sum should be equal 1 ?

[19-Apr-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
1+2/3

[19-Apr-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
1+2 == 3

[19-Apr-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
3/3 == 1

[19-Apr-19 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
1 + 2/3 = 5/3 != 1

[19-Apr-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and my method actually doesnt lose any precision until the last /3

[19-Apr-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
(1+2)/3

[19-Apr-19 09:12 PM] TonyL#3577
reliability weights normalizing to 1 (sum of weights should be equal 1)

[19-Apr-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as denominator equals sum of weights, it is the same

[19-Apr-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
doing integer math, you cant use fractions

[19-Apr-19 09:12 PM] TonyL#3577
