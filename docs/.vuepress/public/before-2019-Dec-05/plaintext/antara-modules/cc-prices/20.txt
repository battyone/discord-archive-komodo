Anyway it looks like a not big deal on this point and we can add prices in fututre depends of users demand

[16-May-19 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Is there any safe way to clean non-sent mempool?

[16-May-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
I generated transaction to mempool when no nodes mine, then realized that better to use other param but now "non-correct" transaction is in mempool

[16-May-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is in the mempool, and it is valid, it is hard to get rid of

[16-May-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
I see, wonder it's recorded to wallet.dat

[16-May-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

`BETS0` baby born. Maturing now üòÉ

7000 in fund, 7.777 in fund fees (with minrelease 10), rest I left for testers

Wen testing?

[16-May-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Probably next week

[16-May-19 07:35 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW, about that TonyL idea of hedging by trading with some funds on cryptomarkets: 
although blockchain cant make purchases, I assume there is an owner of betting fund and he might decide to hedge risks by sending some funding to cryptomarkets...

[16-May-19 07:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Since anybody can quite easily start own fund (to be a kinda broker) there might be a lot of interesting approaches/strategies

[16-May-19 07:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Theoretically some actual broker business can try to merge some services to such CC imo (just with some modifications - let's say only x1 leverage positions and only 1 item specific synthetic)

[16-May-19 07:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Hope fintech sector will notice this tech, in combination with other CCs it looks like gamechanger üòÉ

[16-May-19 07:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe no need existing fintech sector but new one needs to be built ü§î

i think if people see that the balancing bets are incentivized, then they are more likely to do them, especially the contrarians who would want to make the bet against what everybody knows will happen

[16-May-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the question becomes what level of incentive can be allowed

[16-May-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe somewhere around usual maker/taker fee on CEXes
If we taking 0.5% for unbalanced positions we may take let's say 0.2% for "balancing" end

[16-May-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Or 0.5 0.3

[16-May-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it 1% for unbalance and 0% for balancing

[16-May-19 07:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, looks like Bitmex added longs paying to shorts / shorts paying to longs thing to solve similar balance problem

[16-May-19 07:47 PM] TonyL#3577
When more shorts than longs opened - there shorts paying to longs each 8 hours and vice versa

[16-May-19 07:48 PM] dimxy#2587
As I can see in the real world situations could be often when many positions are still unbalanced, so the house is at risk to lose

[16-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, perfect balance is never achieved

[16-May-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to manage it within the range where the capital available will absorb the worst case

[16-May-19 07:52 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder we can evolve risk management mechanisms with each BETSX chain - let's say if chain 1 rekt - we can add more "defense" for next chain and start it with more funding and so on

[16-May-19 07:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Not possible to predict now what will happen because there is no such markets for now (at least I don't know any) where you can construct some synthetic with stocks and cryptos and bet on it with leverage

[16-May-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[16-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
this is an iterative process

[16-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point the BETi chain will represent real money and we get to see the real testing

[16-May-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at first it will be easy to break though

[16-May-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Will BETS0 be pegged to BETS value?

[16-May-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe we can just set some bounty in KMD for best traders to try to drain it asap

[16-May-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is ready for sidechain testing, we can

[16-May-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
And with each BETSi chain we can make traders tournament

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is simpler

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Until it's solid

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe sidechain testing is done separately

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
until the betting and sidechain are working in isolation

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then we combine it

[16-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and it will automatically be a for money tournament all the time

[16-May-19 08:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so for now for BETSi chains will make bounty mechanics similar to KMDICE funds locked in betting plan

[16-May-19 08:01 PM] TonyL#3577
And I think I can put BETSi KMD gateway for winning withdrawal to battletest gateways as well

[16-May-19 08:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, gateway import value not export üòÉ

[16-May-19 08:01 PM] TonyL#3577
So need vice versa - deposit some KMD to get some BETSi

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
how will you do that? you would need -ac_pegs working

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, wait

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make a normal KMD gateways CC

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and then put orders in the DEX

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, thats what I'm thinking about

[16-May-19 08:03 PM] TonyL#3577
gatewaysCC

[16-May-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I have 700 free supply now and 7000 locked in plan

[16-May-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
At first I can sell these 700 in gatewaysCC for KMD

[16-May-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Then players can bet to try drain these funds and withdraw back

[16-May-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or make an NFT, with expensive price

[16-May-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the winner is the first that can purchase the NFT

[16-May-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
redeemable for all the deposited KMD

[16-May-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh nice idea

[16-May-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Only problem is that what if somebody will buy all available in gateway supply

[16-May-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a one person - it will kill all fun

[16-May-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there would be contest participants that are just given a fixed amount of BET0

[16-May-19 08:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, at first collect applications with discord username and wallet address, then just send available supply in same proportions between participants

[16-May-19 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Winner have to make most profit from trading

[16-May-19 08:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I have to redesign chain so:  700 supply + 7000 in fund if give each participant 7 coins (100 participants cap) it might take a lot of time and a lot of luck is needed to drain it.
I think I'll make 7000 circulating supply and 7000 funds in house so players will have 1:100 proportion

[16-May-19 08:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to make some leaderboard also

[16-May-19 08:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh explorer richlist will be leaderboard actually üòÉ

a single trader games bitstamp price (buy dumping 2000+ BTC!) to change bitmex marked price to gain on his short positions!

[17-May-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
interestingly prices CC design avoids such things as we use the 24hr price so it isnt the free money the "short bitmex and dump on the market" strategy is

[17-May-19 08:08 AM] Andersen#8337
Mean  median  24Hrs  index  ?

[17-May-19 08:09 AM] Andersen#8337
Like  Bitmex marking price , but longer period

[17-May-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the marking price is the 24 average of the correlated prices: http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[17-May-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the green line

[17-May-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
correlated price is the brown line, which is a randomly selected price from the past day that correlates with majority of price samples starting from that random price (rotating buffer)

[17-May-19 08:18 AM] Andersen#8337
great

[17-May-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is still possible to mess around with prices, but only if you sustain it for better part of the day

[17-May-19 11:42 AM] jorian#4555
so you dump the market to shit, but because you opened short positions you profit insanely

[17-May-19 11:42 AM] jorian#4555
smart move

[17-May-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if he opened a 100x short, on a 35 million dollar sell, drops price $1000, makes $200 million?

[17-May-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
even if he didnt collect the $35 mil from selling, it would be ok

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying to make  testnet for BETS0 with same chain params but with little delay to test rekt bot and GUI 

So for this chain using specific daemon with  `#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW (7)` in komodo_defs.h but in prices output daywindow is 289. 
```  "result": "success",
  "seed": 2525121736298361961,
  "height": 27,
  "maxsamples": 1,
  "width": 580,
  "daywindow": 289,
  "numpricefeeds": 127
```
Am I need to change daywindow defining somewhere else?

[17-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
how is the 289 calculated in the rpc call that prints the "daywindow"

[17-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the answer is in the source code

[17-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
seek and you shall find

https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/blob/prices-rpc/src/rpc/blockchain.cpp#L1316

[17-May-19 03:28 PM] TonyL#3577
As I understand it should print just `PRICES_DAYWINDOW`

[17-May-19 03:29 PM] TonyL#3577
So problem is that `PRICES_DAYWINDOW` not changed

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] TonyL#3577

Also looks suspicious that profits loss became more than positionsize with negative equity (I wonder if it's rekt it should became 0)
```  "positionsize": 1.00000000,
      "profits": -1.04048070,```

[17-May-19 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/blob/prices-rpc/src/cc/prices.cpp#L1337 I think there should be special case kinda `if is_rekt` it became 0 but not negative

I thought I was supposed that there were soft of 'scanners' which would check actually every block for rekt positions and would not allow equity go to negative

[17-May-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
should be, but no guarantee. need to handle even negative cases
