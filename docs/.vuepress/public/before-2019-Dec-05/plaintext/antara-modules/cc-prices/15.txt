yes, balance needs to be calculated every block

[07-May-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but that can be cached locally, i dont think it needs to be in consensus

[07-May-19 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already know how to implement tracking of top 3999 address, such that the last notarized height the balance fo the top 3999 addresses is known. Also it will be possible to know the live balance of each top 3999 address at each block, but basing tx conensus on this leaves possibility of tx not being mined in the enxt exact block and such would become invalid if the balance changed before it was mined.

[07-May-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
snapshots can just be paid out max daily, likely not even monthly as it is only for the BET fees

[07-May-19 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have not actaully tried to implement this yet, as the snapshot is working perfectly as it is, just a little slow for chain syncs when chain gets longer.

[07-May-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Just to be sure if I understood idea correct: should be part of `BETS0` pricesCC revenue  distributed on main `BET` chain between `BET` coin holders or on `BETS0` ?

So scheme is something like this: "buffer" wallet A accumulating fees, then each let's say 6 hours 20% of fees airdropping to holders of (not sure what exactly), another 80% sendning to pricesCC address which covers payouts for bets.

If setup `BET` <- `BETS0` 1:1 gateway I think that I have to set extra low mining rewards on `BETS0` and this chain should be notarised

[07-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[07-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
BETS0 is a BET sidechain

[07-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the only direct connection to BET

[07-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
prices CC fees goes to a snapshot CC address

[07-May-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody can then trigger a 100% payout to BET0 holders in proportion, ie. airdrop of the accumulated fees

[07-May-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all sidechains need to have a low mining reward that is fully covered by external subsidies

[07-May-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and it should be notarized, but we can live without it while testing

[07-May-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
people use prices CC, snapshot address accumulates fees, anyone can trigger an airdrop in propoprtion to BETS0 held in normal address

[07-May-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is for BETS0 chain to attract BET deposits into BETS0 to collect the revshares

[07-May-19 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok so you can send BET to the BETS0 chain, and the amount held there determines the proportions of who is paid.

[07-May-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the BET chain istelf, has nothing much to do with it, apart from being the source of the funds?

[07-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
its only purpose is to have external value in the BETS0 chain

[07-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
each BET is worth a few dollars

[07-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so this automatically creates a bounty system to find bugs or just earn money betting

[07-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
not to mention create one of the first ever fully functioning DAO

[07-May-19 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I understand this now, should work with existing paymetns plan, although we may need to use 2 plans, to distribute the 20/80 revenue first, so the 20% goes to airdrop payments plan, and the otehr 80% can go back where its uspposed to be.

[07-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no 20/80

[07-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
100% goes to snapshot, tony was just confused

[07-May-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is even easier 😃

[07-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i tried to design the different pieces so they can be combined without changes

[07-May-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we need a verushash11 chain with low block rewards with a payments plan created, then the pricessCC will need to pay its fees to the txidpk address.

[07-May-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this covers it ?

[07-May-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if pricesCC fees are hardcoded in source no earlytxid is needed, that is for address to pay to.

[07-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems so

[07-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
will need to bootstrap just the BET fee scriptPubKey, but that wont affect chain creation

[07-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or with the extra data, maybe we cam know the exact scriptPubKey ahead of time

[07-May-19 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
currently the txidpk address does nto use an op_return or ccvout... but if you can create this address before starting the pricessCC, either hardcode this address in pricessCC code, OR use earlytxid to define the address.

[07-May-19 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_snapshot=1440 ` @TonyL  something like this will work pretty well I think.

[07-May-19 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @blackjok3r Is ac_snapshot period in minutes of how often it be claimed or?

[07-May-19 11:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
an_snapshot is required to use payments Airdropp... 1440 means 1440 blocks (24H) a snapshot of the chain is made, this is valid for 24H until the next once happens, any paymentsrelease issued between this range will use the saved balances at that height. It was very tricky to get paymetns airdrop to reach consenus. Currently doing it more than once a day will be just too slow. I know how to fix this, at least at a conceptual level, but I have not implemented it at this stage as this solution seems very stable even if its a little slow.

[07-May-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
this is perfectly fine

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-May-19 11:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One thing that needs to be checked is that the address balances saved are actually correct 😉 It has to rewind blocks back tothe last notarized height (or 100 blocks)

[07-May-19 11:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can do this by just using -stopat on the payments game chain. Will trey to do this tomorrow.

[07-May-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be months before there are enough revshare accumulated to warrant a payment release, so daily granularity is no problem at all

[07-May-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
After jok3r explanation I wonder that before start sidechain chain pricesCC should be able to send fees to address from `earlytxid` param

[07-May-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need for earlytxid

[07-May-19 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing it longer than 1 day is also problematic, as it has to rewind back to the last snapshot height every daemon start, and doing that for thousands and tousands of blocks will take a long time.

[07-May-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that we do need it, because we need he scriptpubkey to pay to, and plan must be created for that fisrt.

[07-May-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
regardless if you use txidpk address or global address you still need the plan creation txid

[07-May-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, ok, i guess we need some detailed step by step

[07-May-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the -earlytxid will need to be coded into the pricesCC liek I did with `komodo_appendACscript`

maybe something in validation, to amke sure people cannot start a chain with a diffrent or no -earlytxid and then pay something else.

[08-May-19 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
So I wonder we need help of @dimxy with hardcoding of address from -earlytxid usage as an address for fees to start a such chain

[08-May-19 05:27 AM] dimxy#2587
seems I had the address for this

[08-May-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the payout address needs to be to a special CC vout that does snapshots

[08-May-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
payments sent to that address would only be released as a snapshot airdrop

[08-May-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
since it will be a sidechain of BET, (assuming all BET coins are in the sidechain) it acts like sending to BET address and distributing from there

[08-May-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i expect there will be different BET sidechains, so in a way the BET hodler would bet on which sidechain has the best revshares

[08-May-19 06:00 AM] dimxy#2587
what 's the special vout structure?

[08-May-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
for non-side chains, it would be sent to a normal address

[08-May-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to get the exact scriptPubKey from blockjok8r

[08-May-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it is created by making th payment plan, then funded with payments fund. It has no op_return. 
```txidpk = CCtxidaddr(txidaddr,txid);
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1of2vout(EVAL_PAYMENTS,amount,Paymentspk,txidpk));```
You need to create the payments plan First, so you have the txid. this txid could be supplied by an op_return with `-earlytxid` or you can make payments plan, then hardcode the txid in the daemon.

[08-May-19 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any payments ccvout in that address can be spent by paymentsrelease

[08-May-19 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alternativly you can pay it to global paymentsCC address with a ccopret or opreturn. But I think in this case its not required to do that, only adds extra complexity

[08-May-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to hardcode txid in the daemon, it needs to automaticall switch between payout to snapshot for BET sidechain or to normal BET address in other case

[08-May-19 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If showen where in pricessCC it is amking this payment I can add it if required, using -earlytxid.

[08-May-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I think the prices CC code just needs to look for -earlytxid if it exists and if it is sidechain then send to payments CC scriptPubKey

[08-May-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
else send to BET address

[08-May-19 06:28 AM] dimxy#2587
is it 0,5% of bet amout?

[08-May-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that sounds good

[08-May-19 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How i did it for appendACscript was ther first time it is needed by validation, lookup the earlytxid op_return and save it to a static variable.

[08-May-19 06:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty sure it must be in validation code, otherwise its not consensus and people will be able to change it

[08-May-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it is in the validation code, of course

[08-May-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
just not the specific txid

[08-May-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
usage of the EARLYTXID variable is done and further it needs to make sure it is within first 100 blocks of chain and a valid txid to use for the intended purpose

[08-May-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but this can be coded once for all the usages of earlytxid based plans

[08-May-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
we might need another param to differentiate between different usages

[08-May-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe it is encoded in the scriptPubKey

[08-May-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
its ok to be updating the validation code once, but not for each and every different txid

[09-May-19 07:46 AM] dimxy#2587
as I understand we need to start a new prices cc chain to make earlytxid work

[09-May-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is for bootstrapping a new chain

[09-May-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can have the validations all active too

[09-May-19 07:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
I haven't merged some fix for earlytxid to FSM yet..

[09-May-19 07:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
But I see someone added 
```cpp
 ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT = GetArg("-ac_earlytxidcontract",0);
fprintf(stderr, "ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT.%i\n", ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT);```

[09-May-19 07:57 AM] Mihailo#5902
This should not be ac param

[09-May-19 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why ?

[09-May-19 07:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
As ac params should affect magiccalc and this is added later when chain is already created so it should be regular param. I think JL mentioned it like that.

[09-May-19 07:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
I've made it like this:
```cpp
KOMODO_EARLYTXID = Parseuint256(GetArg("-earlytxid","0").c_str());
    if (KOMODO_EARLYTXID!=zeroid && (tx_height(KOMODO_EARLYTXID)==0 || tx_height(KOMODO_EARLYTXID)>100))
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"earlytx can be only in first 100 blocks or does not exist\n");
        StartShutdown();
    }```

[09-May-19 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no, incorrect. This needs to be magic value, becuase it defines what contract the earlytxid script pubkey is used by... If iot did not affect magic people can just chagne the contract eval code and pay to diffrent contracts.

[09-May-19 08:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, maybe I misunderstood EARLYTXIDCONTRACT

[09-May-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As earlytxid was already there, I just used it as it was. I guess with that check on daemon load, some of my code can be remvoed, but thats isnt not a big deal, we can sort it out.

[09-May-19 08:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
EARLYTXID should just contain the txid of valid CC create tx.

[09-May-19 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used it very diffrenctly

[09-May-19 08:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, so as I said probably we are speaking of different things 😉

[09-May-19 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the way I used it, I created a new RPC that creates an op_return with an arbitrary hex string.

[09-May-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
there is earlytxid and earlytxidcontract

{Reactions}
👌 

[09-May-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
two different things

[09-May-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
latter needs to affect magic

[09-May-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
former cant

[09-May-19 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is used to strore the scriptPukKey the contract/ac_script pays to. 
There are 2 ways its currently used, it can take an op_return for a contract and append that to the CCvout, so that coinbase cna pay a contract with ac_script, earlytxid appends extra data from the op_return to the ac_script.
Allowing coinbase to fund a contract. Also added yesterday for prices/payments to work together, we can make payments plan before block 100, extract the scriptpubkey that allows it to be paid, and then another contract can use thisscriptpubkey to fund the paymetns plan. Should also work for any contract.

[09-May-19 08:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In short, coinbase pays a contract, and a contract can pay a contract. But its limited basically to a special chain. You cant create contracts that fund each other on a chain that already exists.

[09-May-19 08:07 AM] Mihailo#5902
👍

```Also added yesterday for prices/payments to work together, we can make payments plan before block 100, extract the scriptpubkey that allows it to be paid, and then another contract can use thisscriptpubkey to fund the paymetns plan.``` @blackjok3r Could you please provide some guide how to start prices chain with fees paying on airdrop contract address and how to initiate airdrop distribution then?
