actually it is time to setup some min amount percentage below which rekt is considered. 
Now I simply check if equity are  < 0.
Maybe set something like 10% from initial betamount ?

[17-May-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[17-May-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be these 10% of left equity returned back to player in case of rekt on this point?

[17-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
no

it will be split between whoever submits the rekt and the house

[17-May-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
90% to house 10% to the rekt-er

[17-May-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that will ensure all rektable positions are rekt

[17-May-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm,  10% from initial betamount looks too huge

[17-May-19 06:09 PM] TonyL#3577
imo

[17-May-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe something around 2-3%?

[17-May-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe depends on leverage

[17-May-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the more leverage the higher the percentage cutoff

[17-May-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
2% for 1:1, 10% for 100x

[17-May-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Since fee is flat - thats fair

[17-May-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
with the daily smoothing its not like dumping 2000 BTC to change the price will rekt you immediate

[17-May-19 09:06 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW, before this, we fixed to whom who did rekt 0,2% from the amount
now he will receive from 2%\*10% = 0,2% to 10%\*10% = 1%

it still easily goes negative with leverage 777 even with min margin (or something wrong with arithmetic)
(but my daywindow is test and small =7)

[17-May-19 10:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Using same daywindow on the test chain

[17-May-19 10:24 PM] TonyL#3577
What if for this use some variable B which connected to variable A and if variable A is positive B = A, but if A is negative B = 0 ?

[17-May-19 10:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So B will never jump into negative

[17-May-19 10:30 PM] TonyL#3577
In general if despite of negative amounts all payouts doing correct I can just show negative as 0 in GUI

[17-May-19 10:34 PM] dimxy#2587
it is possible, just arithmetic  will be incorrect in pricesinfo

[17-May-19 10:36 PM] dimxy#2587
as I understand  777 is too big, and 100%/777 = just 0,12% price change sends position to negative

[17-May-19 10:38 PM] dimxy#2587
as we allow %1 price change per block we probably should not allow leverage > 100 or even less

[17-May-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, x100 is nice limit

[17-May-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577

Hi @dimxy ! So if back to rekt things:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/8Cyvw5fxz3/ made some rekts yesterday, it looks like 10% from `profit` sending to "rekter" (since profits went negative `-1.5` rekter received `~0.15`, for other bet where profit was `-1` rekter received `~0.1`
I thought it should be 10% from 10%

[18-May-19 12:48 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, needs to be corrected

[18-May-19 12:51 PM] dimxy#2587
I thought yet about negative equity due to large loss: 
if we cut such losses at 10% not allowing to go negative, we would actually forgive the bettor his losses from his thoughtless big leverages.  It could be unfair

[18-May-19 12:53 PM] dimxy#2587
I think better to limit allowed leverages to never allow to go negative.

Unlike bitmex or similar who can more precise control on prices moves, we don have it as we have 10min time interval and changes might go to  1%

[18-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw I'm starting chains with 5 mins blocktime now

[18-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, we have not best mechanics for high leverages gambling

[18-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
But just can left it up to 100 in case if somebody will want to sponsor house this way üòÉ

[18-May-19 12:58 PM] dimxy#2587
i can see you use 200 leverage, so 0,5% move would eat position

[18-May-19 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, very easy to get rekt

[18-May-19 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But almost impossible to take profit because bet maturing 24 hours

[18-May-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Only attention deserving strategy with high leverage is scalping - but imo it's not possible to scalp with 24 hours delay and bet on average

[18-May-19 01:05 PM] dimxy#2587
yes our betting is based on very smoothed value

[18-May-19 01:07 PM] TonyL#3577
From my point of view it's strategy based mostly on apophenia TA and coin toss gambling - maybe for such bets chain with blocktime/prices updates every 10 seconds or so is needed

[18-May-19 01:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But if somebody will want to sponsor fund on 10 minutes blocks chain - it's good for fund üòÉ

[18-May-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant have too fast a blocktime, that would mean a lot of price queries and nodes could get blocked

the services return updates with 1 min interval as I can see

[18-May-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
not faster than a minute, yes

0.84 is probably the change

[18-May-19 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm thats strange - it looks like in input tx of pricesrekt 0.15 from initial 0.995 bet returned to player and 0.84 to fund

Also rekter received  `"value": 0.00100000,`, initial bet was 1 coin (200 leverage), 10% from 1 coin is 0.1, 2% from 0.1 is 0.002

[18-May-19 03:57 PM] dimxy#2587
actually I consider fund's coins as a whole. That is I don't spend specific bet's inputs but add any available inputs from fund's global address and just provide the balance (if I correctly understand your concern)

[18-May-19 03:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I see

[18-May-19 04:06 PM] dimxy#2587
min margin calculation is: 
[1, 100] - min margin propotional to leverage, 
[100, 777] - min margin fixed at 10% (otherwise it would grow > 50%)
