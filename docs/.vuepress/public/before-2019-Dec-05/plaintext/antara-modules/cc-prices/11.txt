i see, so it cant affect the overall success rate, other than by starting fresh it adds more equity so can move an existing positon away from the rekt percentage

[26-Apr-19 07:36 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, if for example I bet on price grow but it constantly went down, then by adding more funds I might delay the rekt

[26-Apr-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as future knowledge isnt able to be used the system will be fine

[26-Apr-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and adding more funds to a bad position is usually a bad thing

[26-Apr-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Is `pricessetcostbasis` should apply to all "subbets"? Otherwords - should I wait for all subbets to mature to fix costbasis? And what to do if pricessetcostbasis was set already

[26-Apr-19 02:19 PM] dimxy#2587
I believe we have deprecated pricessetcostbasis for now

[26-Apr-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok great

[26-Apr-19 02:20 PM] dimxy#2587
I just scan the chain from the first height and calc the costbasis. When 24h passed I stop and use the latest value

[26-Apr-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Are these changes in some new branch?

[26-Apr-19 02:22 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, in myrepo, the branch is the same prices-rpc

I see how Forex works: if I made a position  then later I can add more to it at the price active at this new moment. A position now consists of two.
So I think when we 're adding another funding we 're doing somewhat similar?

`I see how Forex works: if I made a position  then later I can add more to it at the price active at this new moment. A position now consists of two.` - trading on Bitmex let's say working different way - you can add margin to position (funds without leverage) so your leverage decreasing and rekt price moving

Would be great to have some fintech-ninja advisor

[26-Apr-19 03:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Because even in Bittmex model which looks simplier than a lot of parallel bets - there are some limits for added margin, and possible to take it back on some points when your position stands good. And these values should be calculated

[26-Apr-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Apr-19 05:45 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually Bitmex like Forex allows adding more orders to a position (combining same orders to one position).
And Bitmex also indeed allows to add or remove margin to a position changing its leverage by this

[26-Apr-19 05:54 PM] TonyL#3577
`Actually Bitmex like Forex allows adding more orders to a position` just realised that it's a same thing which we have now üòÉ

[26-Apr-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Imo it'll be super clear for trader if display "synthetic on which bet was made", "average positon price", "position rekt price" for total position

[26-Apr-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
` "average positon price", "position rekt price"` these things possible to calculate on interface side

[26-Apr-19 06:00 PM] dimxy#2587
well I can calculate this on the server side

[26-Apr-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
```average position price = (position1size * position1price + position2size * position2price + ... + positionNsize * positionNsize) / all_positions_sizes_sum```

[26-Apr-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be something like this if my arithmetic correct (by positon1, position2 I mean sub-positions inside position for which we calculating average price)

[26-Apr-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that now position can be counted as rekt when `-profit` = `TotalPositionSize` ?

[26-Apr-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah found it in comments ```    if synthetic value + amount goes negative, then anybody can rekt it to collect a rektfee```

[26-Apr-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So from your side should be not hard to display rekt price

[26-Apr-19 06:14 PM] dimxy#2587
yes I noticed Forex calculates average price in a similar way - as weighed by position sizes.
I consider rekt when  (totalbets + totalprofts) < 0 
(and I also see that it might when it reaches some percentage)

[26-Apr-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Just for player it's not clear what to track with such condition (when losses equal positon side), but when player see price on which his position will be liquidated he starting to track price

[26-Apr-19 06:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Price X on which losses will exceed the position size is predetermined so clue is only print it

[26-Apr-19 06:19 PM] dimxy#2587
yes  I will add it

[26-Apr-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool! I'll be able to show rekt price line on graph when player select active positon

[26-Apr-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just realized that would be great to make tool which will make graphs dynamically for "non-standart" synthetics

[26-Apr-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's say player made some USDBTCBTC/JPYKMDSTRAT position and want to check dynamics graph for this synthetic price

[26-Apr-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Should help with debug as well, will try to make it

[26-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I think we should allow rekt before equity goes negative

[26-Apr-19 08:51 PM] dimxy#2587
As I understand it, Bitmex calls the price when all the margin is spent on  the loss (becomes == 0) as 'Bankruptcy Price'
And they set Liquidation price as some fraction from the Bankruptcy Price allowing to collect some value to the Insurance Fund. 
This fraction depends on leverage (more the leverage less the fraction) So for leverage = 1 they would have Liquidation price as 50%

[29-Apr-19 07:12 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  I added the average costbasis and liqudation price  to the pricesinfo.
The liquidation price is now calculated when equity drops to 0 (but it could be easily changed to some percentage like 10%)

Would be great to display synthetic, also there was an issue with `!` (not found the way to use it) and operator  `/` created position with suspicious price. @dimxy is it fine if I open issues in your repo? (so it'll be easier to track issues on github than in chat )

[29-Apr-19 01:09 PM] dimxy#2587
yes I remember about  the synthetic
I need to either store it in the opret or write a function which would reverse parsed vector.
It's  okey to open issues in my repo, of course

[29-Apr-19 02:46 PM] dimxy#2587
if you had bash errors when using '!' operator, I managed to get it work by escaping and quoting:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet  0.000666 1 "BTC_USD,"\\!",1"

[29-Apr-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, quotes and escaping.
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet  0.000666 1 "BTC_USD,"\!",1"
parsed synthetic: BTC_USD ! 1 ```
 That works, thanks!

[29-Apr-19 05:02 PM] dimxy#2587
when I calculate average costbasis,
I could lose precision or get into overflow for either BTC_USD or BTC_USD,!

[30-Apr-19 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
To make  graphs for "non-standart prices" and other stuff I'm making  python library which counting prices independent on client side. Main idea is possibility to operate with accessory displaying things by single prices call output evaluation to custom (not presented in pricesoutput) datasets which can be used as Python list or as CSV file let's say.

(prices call with depth 1)
```
print(visualization_lib.count_stack(rpc_connection, ["BTC_USD", "KMD_BTC", "*", 1], "1"))
 [0.938448574, 1.01312870023, 0.9942287837837783]
```

and for `./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1 1 "BTC_USD, KMD_BTC, *, 1"` position: 
```
...
  "LastPrice": 0.99388133,
...
}
```

Looks like it works fine - but not support many things yet. For now it possible to create "non-standart" price dataset for single stack with * or / operator.
! - will not be implemented. Instead made support of mirror pairs: e.g. USD_BTC will grab 1/BTC_USD prices

[30-Apr-19 06:35 AM] dimxy#2587
BTW  one of my tasks is the development of a rpc call which would allow to convert a non-existing pair like  KMD_JPY into a set of existing pairs "USD_JPY, USD_KMD, /,1".  This is to be done yet.

Such convertion would be great, at the moment I'm just grabbing all pairs names from prices output then checking if X_Y pair presists, if not checking if Y_X presists, if also not - saying user that luck not on his side today üòÉ (https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/lib/visualization_lib.py#L127)

why are they all losses?

[30-Apr-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
All these bets longs and markets not  good these days

[30-Apr-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so not a bug, just bad trading

[30-Apr-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think so - will open now more both shorts and longs to be sure

[30-Apr-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Opened two positions with same amount and in same block with -10 and +10 leverage - so will be easy to trackdown how things behave atm

[30-Apr-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also make some crazy type of synthetic

[30-Apr-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 77 10 "BTC_USD, KMD_BTC, *, 1, STRAT_BTC, BCHABC_BTC, /, 5"``` Is it crazy enough?
