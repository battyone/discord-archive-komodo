crazy synthetics  would not work yet, 
I need to change calculations  to big num  in some more places

[30-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
thats not so crazy, i was thinking more like a weighted index of 20

[30-Apr-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810

[30-Apr-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
```"firstheight": 3979

[30-Apr-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810

hmm profits for short started to calculate but for long not

[30-Apr-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
no profits on long side

[30-Apr-19 09:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, for long costbasis still equal LastPrice, not quite understand how it's calculating

[30-Apr-19 09:03 PM] TonyL#3577
How for diametrical positions one can be in profit and other not in minus

[30-Apr-19 09:03 PM] TonyL#3577
If I've opened -10 and +10 positions at same block: if one is -0.1 I expect other to be +0.1

[30-Apr-19 09:04 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW  firstheight isnt the block where the tx is mined but equals to chaintip at the moment when the tx is created.
Maybe it is better to change it to actually mined block?

[30-Apr-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I checked `getrawtransaction 1` for these two bets and block is same for both (so profits should be equal to 0 in total I wonder): ```  "height": 3980,
  "confirmations": 5,
  "rawconfirmations": 5,
```

[30-Apr-19 09:06 PM] dimxy#2587
yes but the firstehight is 3979

[30-Apr-19 09:06 PM] dimxy#2587
I think the correct is 3980

[30-Apr-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do the min vs max logic, there is no assurance at all that it will be symmetric

[30-Apr-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Symmetrical positions with 2 stacks synthetic behave the same atm (short started to show some negative profits, long staying at 0)

[30-Apr-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, have to find formula, now not understand  clear how it's calculating

[30-Apr-19 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
`min vs max logic` shouldn't it calculate as fixed costbasis vs current price?

[30-Apr-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
costbasis changes every block (maybe) for first 24hrs

[30-Apr-19 09:15 PM] dimxy#2587
I calculate it as max price for longs
Or min for shorts for the period to 24h

[30-Apr-19 09:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so this logic using before costbasis is fixed on some point (24 hours or 7 blocks in test mode)

[30-Apr-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
So let's say: I opened long when price was on 1000, it's spike to 1500 at hour 10, on 24th hour price down back to 1000
My costbasis fixing now.  Will it be like I'm opened long on 1500 but current price is 1000 so I'm in -33% loss?

[30-Apr-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes!

[30-Apr-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can leverage it 100x or more and make up for the losses

[30-Apr-19 09:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so at first it's actually just some "replay" before real data start

[30-Apr-19 09:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be omegalul to be rekt during replay üòÇ

[30-Apr-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
well i think you wanted to be able to be rekt during the first 24hrs

[30-Apr-19 09:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I've just understood system wrong before I think

[30-Apr-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant have future knowledge being used for the bets

[30-Apr-19 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Accept bets which apriori rekt by historical data It's like a accept bets on score 3-1 in football match on the next day when it finished with 0-0 score

[30-Apr-19 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
since the greenline takes 24 hrs backwards, it is contaminated with future knowledge over the next 24hrs

[30-Apr-19 09:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but in exchange for this, you are only charge fee on the amount bet, not the leveraged amount

[01-May-19 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo  it was `USD/RUB * KMD/BTC` price - RUB is russian ruble yup

`ps looks awesome - is it easy to install, jl777/jl777 & tui?` - thanks üòÉ yeah, at the moment it's working with dimxy repo and things not merged in komodo repos because it's in actively debugging stage
This webapp need few more pip deps but in general steps are just: 
start REKT0 chain, start `python3 prices_app_v2.py` and interface by default availiable on 777 port

[01-May-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy Great! Not totally understood yet how these operators work, will re-read it's description and test when wake-up

[01-May-19 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe understood: so by default all operators multiplying and we can choose which ones we want to flip by `/`

[01-May-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that `///` operator for A/B, A/B, A/B actually will do multiplying B/A * B/A * B/A  and `***` operator for  A/B, A/B, A/B will do A/B * A/B * A/B ?

[01-May-19 10:45 AM] dimxy#2587
/// *** etc requires 3 operands

[01-May-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, but between 3 operands possible to put 2 infix operators 
So actually `A/B, A/B, A/B, ///` is something like a `1 / (A/B) * 1 / (A/B) * 1 / (A/B)` ?

[01-May-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be exact, but it could be arbitraged as over time it should average the same

[01-May-19 03:43 PM] dimxy#2587
so it might be misleading for the user as he might think it is a real  currency pair?

there is no limit to the accumulator

other than the overall length limit of opreturn

[02-May-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577

[02-May-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the weight field puts the product of the weight and top of stack to the accumulator

Can make indexes even like a CMC top100

[02-May-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe not all 100 due to not being on binance or lack of opreturn space
