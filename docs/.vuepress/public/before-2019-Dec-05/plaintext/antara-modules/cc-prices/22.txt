Yup, can remember that. I meant some version where diff is not hardcoded but dynamic

[19-May-19 04:45 PM] TonyL#3577
So miners competition will be üòÉ

[19-May-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
BETS0 matured meanwhile üòÉ

[19-May-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ah, yes interesting. diff adjustment for the tx mining

https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/releases/download/0.01prices/prices_app_BETS0.zip

Ubuntu users who want to participate in prices testing might test this precompiled portable of prices web-interface and komodod 

1) Download
2) unzip
3) cd prices_app_v2
3) start daemon and wait until BETS0 is synced:  ```./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_cc=10777 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_supply=156177 -ac_blocktime=300 -ac_snapshot=288 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237 -ac_prices="ETH, LTC, BNB, NEO, LRC, QTUM, OMG, ZRX, STRAT, IOTA, XVG, KMD, EOS, ZEC, DASH, XRP, STORJ, XMR, BAT, BTS, LSK, ADA, WAVES, STEEM, RVN, DCR, XEM, ICX, HOT, ENJ" -ac_stocks="AAPL,ADBE,ADSK,AKAM,AMD,AMZN,ATVI,BB,CDW,CRM,CSCO,CYBR,DBX,EA,FB,GDDY,GOOG,GRMN,GSAT,HPQ,IBM,INFY,INTC,INTU,JNPR,MSFT,MSI,MU,MXL,NATI,NCR,NFLX,NTAP,NVDA,ORCL,PANW,PYPL,QCOM,RHT,S,SHOP,SNAP,SPOT,SYMC,SYNA,T,TRIP,TWTR,TXN,VMW,VOD,VRSN,VZ,WDC,XRX,YELP,YNDX,ZEN,BRK.A" -addnode=159.69.45.70 -earlytxid=d0de610ad271e0ef966d006a1c6cde67780bb40118f3efdec9bf07e86081e184 -daemon```
4) Start application `./prices_app_v2`

5) Webinterface should be availiable in browser `0.0.0.0:777`

[20-May-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
If you'll see webinterface it means that portable works üòÉ

[20-May-19 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be compatible with Ubuntu 16.04+

[20-May-19 09:09 PM] allbits#5898
Noob trying this :)

Daemon started but longestchain staying at 0

[20-May-19 09:10 PM] allbits#5898
Ahh, there it goes!

[20-May-19 09:11 PM] allbits#5898
Longestchain 944 right now?

[20-May-19 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[20-May-19 09:14 PM] allbits#5898
K. Need to go away from keyboard for a bit. Will get back to it later

[20-May-19 11:05 PM] allbits#5898
So what exactly do I put in my browser address window?

[20-May-19 11:06 PM] SHossain#0007
127.0.0.1:777

[20-May-19 11:07 PM] allbits#5898
Not working for me

[20-May-19 11:08 PM] allbits#5898
But the command worked in terminal. It's giving all kinds of price output

[20-May-19 11:24 PM] allbits#5898
Any ideas? Remember I'm a noob. I take all instruction literally

[20-May-19 11:25 PM] SHossain#0007
how many terminals you are running?

[20-May-19 11:25 PM] SHossain#0007
which command worked?

[20-May-19 11:26 PM] allbits#5898
./prices_app_v2 worked

[20-May-19 11:26 PM] allbits#5898
I've got eight terminals open right now

[20-May-19 11:26 PM] SHossain#0007
you are super advanced üòÉ

[20-May-19 11:27 PM] allbits#5898
Hahaha

[20-May-19 11:27 PM] SHossain#0007
did you see this message when you started `./prices_app_v2`?
```

[20-May-19 11:28 PM] allbits#5898
Oh boy. Such a noob error lol. I was looking at wrong terminal hehe

[20-May-19 11:29 PM] allbits#5898
I got s bunch of errors and it exited

[20-May-19 11:29 PM] SHossain#0007
did you start the daemon with pubkey? or, did you set the pubkey later after the daemon started?

[20-May-19 11:30 PM] SHossain#0007
when you say error, please make sure to post the error here. otherwise, we wouldn't know what error you have.

[20-May-19 11:31 PM] allbits#5898
I did not start daemon with pubkey, I think.  I literally copied and pasted Tony's command

[20-May-19 11:31 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[20-May-19 11:32 PM] allbits#5898
It's clearly the problem as that's what the error says

[20-May-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
use this command
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BETS0 getnewaddress
```

[20-May-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
it will generate a new address for you

[20-May-19 11:32 PM] allbits#5898
Ok

[20-May-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
then use
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BETS0 validateaddress Rxxxxxxx
```

[20-May-19 11:33 PM] SHossain#0007
replace Rxxxxxxxxx with the address you got

[20-May-19 11:33 PM] SHossain#0007
that will display `pubkey` for you

[20-May-19 11:34 PM] SHossain#0007
then use
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BETS0 setpubkey xxxxxxxxxxx
```

[20-May-19 11:34 PM] allbits#5898
Ok got it

[20-May-19 11:34 PM] SHossain#0007
replace `xxxxxxxxxx` with the pubkey you got

[20-May-19 11:35 PM] allbits#5898
Done

[20-May-19 11:36 PM] SHossain#0007
now use `./prices_app_v2`

[20-May-19 11:37 PM] allbits#5898
Errors

[20-May-19 11:37 PM] allbits#5898
Seem like permissions

[20-May-19 11:37 PM] allbits#5898
sudo?

[20-May-19 11:37 PM] SHossain#0007
yes `sudo ./prices_app_v2`

[20-May-19 11:37 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL seems i'm not alone in this

[20-May-19 11:38 PM] allbits#5898
Yay!!!

[20-May-19 11:42 PM] allbits#5898
What can I do with this now?

[20-May-19 11:45 PM] SHossain#0007
nothing

[20-May-19 11:45 PM] SHossain#0007
you confirmed it works üòÑ

[20-May-19 11:45 PM] SHossain#0007
you can browse to `127.0.0.1:777`

[20-May-19 11:46 PM] allbits#5898
I've done that. I see it in browser and can select various pairs to look at. Is there any actions to be taken, testing to be done?

[20-May-19 11:46 PM] SHossain#0007
Tony will add more things for testing later

[20-May-19 11:47 PM] SHossain#0007
this is the early version of his Prices CC dAPP

[20-May-19 11:47 PM] SHossain#0007
it seems me and you had to run with `sudo`

[20-May-19 11:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i wonder if this is the case with everyone

[20-May-19 11:50 PM] allbits#5898

Seems that change is hardforking for testnet

[21-May-19 06:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Good news is that no bets/rekts yet on BETS0 so I just updated it nodes. Temporary deleted from github testing portable GUI since it contains daemon out of consensus (rektsensus)

[21-May-19 06:39 PM] dimxy#2587
better to remove the validation of txid then... removed

[21-May-19 06:42 PM] dimxy#2587
How many bet tx are we expecting?
(searching the opposite bets algo is not very efficient and it might be a bottleneck)

[21-May-19 06:53 PM] TonyL#3577
`How many bet tx are we expecting?` 
In case of bots/automated trading it might be thousands per day. On early stages maybe tens-hundreds

[21-May-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
I can make some scaling spam test üòÉ

[21-May-19 07:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Like I did with diceCC: just spam stuff `while True` üòÉ

[21-May-19 07:03 PM] dimxy#2587
for thousands it will be very slow, 
needs optimizing

[21-May-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Very unlikely it'll be thousands on REKT0

[21-May-19 07:04 PM] SHossain#0007
i can keep mining

[21-May-19 07:04 PM] SHossain#0007
just let me know when to start

[21-May-19 07:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, you can start miner if you wish. Just blockreward is very low on REKT0 (10000 sat) because idea of this bounty chain is "fixed" supply

[21-May-19 07:16 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not after mining reward. want to keep the chain going and validate all txs for tests

[21-May-19 07:16 PM] SHossain#0007
will start a miner with 1 thread now

[21-May-19 07:20 PM] allbits#5898
Should I update

[21-May-19 07:23 PM] TonyL#3577
I think everybody fine now because dimxy removed rekt txid validation üòÉ

Hi, I thought that there was a really good explanation of how to create trading pairs by jl777 at the start of the channel.  Can't seem to find it.
Where should I look to find info on creating pairs?

[02-Jun-19 11:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, sry, found it down the bottom of the google doc ü§¶

[02-Jun-19 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF ! Feel free to ask if something is not clear from doc. I've tried to merge all jl777 explanations with some additional examples but maybe something is missing.

[02-Jun-19 01:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi Tony üëã
Thanks.  I wasn't able to get the `synthetic` formatted correctly to make a bet.

I'm about to head out for the day but will try again tomorrow.

[02-Jun-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Which synthetic you've tried to make and which error received?

[02-Jun-19 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
I tried "ZECUSD, USDAAPL, *, -1.7" and multiple variations of that.

[02-Jun-19 01:17 PM] TonyL#3577
I see, so doc is not clear I think :/
