so REKT1 will be combined testing of sidechain gateways CC, prices CC and snapshot payments CC and will create what i think is one of the first fully automated money making system that distributes automatically to the stakeholders

[19-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c What should be the setup for side chains, we talked that there should be minimal funds on side chain and minimal mining reward so that it does not influence the number of coins?

[19-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, -ac_end=1 would be required, if not set then it should abort at startup

[19-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_supply must also be 0

[19-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it also needs -earlytxid so if that is not set, also startshutdown

[19-Apr-19 09:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, didn't know about -ac_end...

[19-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be a small number of coins generated still due to magic calcs for testing and issuing the initial tx

[19-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, we need some coins for initial bind tx. But don't forget also for oracle publishers!

[19-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard it said that there are a "ridiculous number of -ac options"

[19-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think around 10 coins will be issued

[19-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well, now when I look komodo_globals.h, maybe it is true üòÑ

[19-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
which wont be any issue for any chain other than BTC

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
So what does ac_end do?

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
for such chains, we just need to rely on chain creator to burn any excess after all is in place, though having to pay 0,0001 BTC per tx changes the "tx are basically free" concept

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_end stops mining rewards at that height

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
Aha

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
So where does the txfee go?

[19-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
miners

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
To the miners, they have just txfee?

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
which for BTC sidechain might actually get some decent hashrate

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
50 cents per tx...

[19-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
So when everything is set, the oraclepublishers should never get out of funds. They will be miners and publishers?

[19-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or if there are other miners, then they can get out of funds?

[19-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes its true

[19-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a BTC sidechain might need some special rules

[19-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
lets not do it!

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC would be via token only, then none of it is lost to txfees

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD sidechain, is ok as chain creator can just fund the oracles with enough KMD to pay for the txfees

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
0.1 KMD per day?

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
Depending on how much publishers there is.

[19-Apr-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, we would want to collect the rewards from the deposits

[19-Apr-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so that is some additional oraclefeed thing to do later. consolidating utxo and collecting rewards

[19-Apr-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the former useful for all gateways

[19-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Mihailo#5902
In case of lets say 10 publishers. 1440*10ksat * 10 publishers= 1.4 KMD per day if my calc is right

[19-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
0.14 per publisher per day

[19-Apr-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont need all to be publishing every block

[19-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
we need at least n/2 to have publishing

[19-Apr-19 09:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
But to be sure it is working it must be more (if some is down)

[19-Apr-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is a cost we need to pay. 500 KMD per year

[19-Apr-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so if 100,000 is deposited, it will be from rewards. ok, that works assuming we can collecte the msig rewards

[19-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
The msig should basically pay it self, the marker for msig is spent on last markdonetx for tx fee.

[19-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
On withdraw it is created and spent in every sign tx and then spent for txfee in markdone.

[19-Apr-19 09:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
Deposit tx in case of sidechains does not have any markers and txfee either as it is import tx.

[19-Apr-19 09:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
So it is selfcontained system. The only cost is the tx fee of withdraw and msig signing.

[19-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles seems the main cost

[19-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it so that the oracles tx on the sidechain are free?

[19-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, that is the cost of maintaining the system

[19-Apr-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i think @blackjok8r made some free tx possible in the miners for notarization, but if ( KOMODO_SIDECHAIN != 0 && valid oracletx )

[19-Apr-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
then the miners will mine oracle txid without txfee, or if some txfee is needed for the CC logic, some really small amount

[19-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
So to summarize ac params, beside ac_import, ac_end=1 and ac_supply=0 should be set, anything else that should exit the daemon if not set?

[19-Apr-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_perc needs to be 0 too

[19-Apr-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to test to make sure only txfees go to miners

[19-Apr-19 10:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
So the ac_perc should also be added to shutdown condition or is already added somewhere?

[19-Apr-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
should be added, there is no special detect for sidechain shutdown conditions, you are writing the first

[19-Apr-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the ac options setting is really not so complex, there are just so many of them

[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
costbasis print is wrong

[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
From which moment `rekt` start to display and am I understand correct that it's a liquidation price?

[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
costbasis has to be at least 5293.97990000 as that was the open price

[19-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is at least a 5263.45900000/5293.97990000 - 1 percentage loss

[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
-0.5765208893219 % loss but at 100x leverage that is 57.6% loss of equity

[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
rekt would be if you go below 10% of (positionsize + addedbets)

[19-Apr-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`  "profits": 0.00000000,`  should be profits kinda -57.6 on this point?

[19-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
-0.576 of 1

[19-Apr-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh this bet is 1 yes, thought it's 100

[19-Apr-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`rekt would be if you go below 10% of (positionsize + addedbets)` yup, but it's definetly not 0

[19-Apr-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
my code had it at 0, but with the chance to add funds, it seems better to add some buffer zone to rekt positions even with some profit so we boost the blockchain bankroll

[19-Apr-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if you lose 90%, basically it is rekt anyway

[19-Apr-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
~50%  of positions with levarage for example 777 (any very high leverage) will be rekt in 1 block

[19-Apr-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm my daemon hanged

[19-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we are planning to only allow rekt to happen after 24hours, so you can be panicking for a day

[19-Apr-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, so technically I might be rekt in one minute but in fact position will be opened 24 hours?

[19-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure yet

[19-Apr-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it might give too much of an advantage

[19-Apr-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
we might make it so that if a position is rekt after the costbasis is establishedm then it is rekt

[19-Apr-19 10:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, if you rekt - you rekt and position liquidated. Not sure if it can work diffent way

[19-Apr-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
at 777x margin a 0.15% move in the wrong direction will wipe it out

[19-Apr-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok, @dimxy, make it so

[19-Apr-19 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Otherwise you can play with additionalfunding and never be rekt

[19-Apr-19 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if a position is rekt, even without costbasis tx, it can be rekt

[19-Apr-19 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Just need big pockets and mathematically correct risk managament and will win in 100% of cases I think (in case of 24h immune to rekt)

[19-Apr-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Or just not stopped correctly (my daemon hanged and I killed its process)

[19-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, what I proposed first did not have any thorough risk management analysis. i think once it comes together we can see how exactly it works and tweak things till it wont be bankruptable

[19-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
with bitmex they charge a fee on the entire leveraged amount, so the max leverage cant be more than 100x

[19-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and they liquidate before it goes to 0 equity

[19-Apr-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to charge less, but still have it so the overall bankroll will be growing over time

[19-Apr-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just not needed to be 22,000 BTC in a year

[19-Apr-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
BTC 2200 more probable that 22000 atm üòÉ

[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I mean the bitmex insurance fund that is funded by the rekt

[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
that doesnt even count the trading fees

[19-Apr-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
bitmex insurance fund up to 22000 BTC ,iguess in 3 years

[19-Apr-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
