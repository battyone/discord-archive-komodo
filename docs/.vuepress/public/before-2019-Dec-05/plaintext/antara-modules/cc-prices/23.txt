I'll add to it all pairs which activated on CFEKBET1 chain to make it more clear

[02-Jun-19 01:18 PM] CrisF#3405
The error on the UI said something about format error

[02-Jun-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
This synthetic is not correct

[02-Jun-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Such tickers does not exists (there are only altcoins/btc pairs, also `_` is separator in ticker) and for single stack weight just 1

[02-Jun-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Also in GUI input synthetic without `"`

[02-Jun-19 01:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, cool!

You can check call: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKBET1 prices 1`

[02-Jun-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
In output you'll see all tickers which you can use in synthetic combining

[02-Jun-19 01:21 PM] CrisF#3405
I did try a few withe the `_` and also with `1`, but not together.

[02-Jun-19 01:21 PM] CrisF#3405
Great!

[02-Jun-19 01:22 PM] CrisF#3405
I've shut it down for the night but will get on to it tomrrow 😃

[02-Jun-19 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
`ZEC_BTC, USD_AAPL, *, 1`
will work  - it'll be (ZEC*USD) /  (BTC * APPL) price 😃 Good night!

[02-Jun-19 01:24 PM] CrisF#3405
ohh, 👍 Thanks!

GUI communicating now with wallet on your VM1

Thanks - I'll wait for that to confirm.

[03-Jun-19 04:56 AM] Mylo#8306
can you play `prices` without LABS or you need LABS installed with prices?

[03-Jun-19 04:58 AM] Mylo#8306
`mypriceslist` changed to `pricesmylist` would not break the naming convention used for RPC calls (already noted on google doc) - everything is named `prices*****`

[03-Jun-19 04:59 AM] Mylo#8306
looks like answer to my first question is `can play without LABS` - because of the precompiled binaries example for pirces @TonyL

[03-Jun-19 04:59 AM] Mylo#8306
the "CFEKBET1" bundle.

[03-Jun-19 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
(mypriceslist -> pricesmylist) Maybe I made typo in doc

[03-Jun-19 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
In bundle actually precompiled kmdlabs (pricescomp branch) daemon

[03-Jun-19 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
`mypriceslist` this call named

[03-Jun-19 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, it is proposal to make all calls looks the same? (start from `price`)

[03-Jun-19 05:04 AM] Mylo#8306
yes,, proposal to change rpc name 😃

[03-Jun-19 05:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Need one more coffee, sry 😃

[03-Jun-19 05:05 AM] TonyL#3577
mypriceslist have semantic sense imo

[03-Jun-19 05:06 AM] TonyL#3577
from other side it might confuse somebody yeah

[03-Jun-19 05:08 AM] Mylo#8306
<app><func>
app=prices 

8 out of  9 RPC methods follow that naming convention.

[03-Jun-19 05:09 AM] Mylo#8306
easier to teach pp/devsl about blockchain applications if the pattern is there imo

Overview of BTC Margin Lending Pool Losses
On Poloniex, we provide a peer-to-peer margin lending and borrowing system for our customers outside of the United States. Below, we…

[06-Jun-19 07:28 PM] TonyL#3577
`All BTC loans on Poloniex are lent in a common pool` - thats why I proposed separate funds between markets with different volatility and etc, looks like the huge risks management mistake

[06-Jun-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
1 volatile market get rekt whole fund, that is just wow. And I bet they have tens of suits with financial degree in their team. Losses the same as marketcap of this CLAM

[06-Jun-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but dont we currently have just one common pool too? i guess we need to separate things out per synthetic?

[06-Jun-19 07:42 PM] TonyL#3577
We have one common too at the moment

[06-Jun-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`i guess we need to separate things out per synthetic?` - I think it might be easier to implement on some chain where allowed to trade only few pais without possibility to create complex synthetics.
When you have endless amount of synthetics - you need to maintain funds in each synthetic pool to make player be able open positions. Now we have infinity variations of prices

[06-Jun-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i guess i made it have too much power

[06-Jun-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
It's something like a keep the plasma

Not easy 😃

[06-Jun-19 08:12 PM] TonyL#3577
For relatively small houses we can abstract from this problem

[06-Jun-19 08:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Problem became actual when fund amount same order as one of the traded assets marketcap

[06-Jun-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Most important is asset liquidity for sure. Simulating in head and in different scenarios market manipulators always win on some point

[01-Oct-19 09:58 AM] Mylo#8306
are the quotes stored in the PRICES blockchain accessible by OTHER blockchain through some cross-chain verification/lookup, currently?

if so, can the OTHER blockchain issue a payment based on a quoted price being higher than a specified value?

[01-Oct-19 09:59 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g.
OTHER blockchain will send a payment every 50,000th block if PRICES records the price of KMD being >$0.60

[01-Oct-19 10:00 AM] Mylo#8306
if not now, possibly in the future.

[02-Oct-19 06:21 PM] dimxy#2587
The quotes are accessible only through prices rpc call (no any oracle solution for this yet AFAIK)

[02-Oct-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to do something like the gateways CC does, write the merkle roots to an oracle for the PRICES chain. then you can prove any specific transaction, using merkle proofs.

[02-Oct-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the prices are stored in the coinbase opreturn. so prove the coinbase tx that has the price you need

[02-Oct-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
alternatively, a multi-nspv solution  might be more direct way to solve this sort of multichain problem

💯 

[03-Oct-19 01:15 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks & thanks.
multi-nspv solution sounds more accessible to tech folk like me
