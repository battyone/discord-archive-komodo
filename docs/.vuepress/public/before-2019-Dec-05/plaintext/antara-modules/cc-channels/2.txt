At least on usual RPC calls level - I'm not creating some evil transactions or changing source code in tests.
It would be great I think if such non-standart things can be added to test framework

[29-Mar-19 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont really need to, the validation just needs to be good enough that these evil transactions cant pass it.

[19-May-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Mz7WTCSSrq/ channelsCC tests failing with some scary errors, investigating

[19-May-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like some tests problem, was not able to reproduce manually on non regtest chain, and tests also passed fine after machine reboot

[19-May-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL you can use `-testnode=1` for running a single network node now

[19-May-19 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
never trusted that regtest would have the same exact behavior as a real chain

[19-May-19 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
those errors probably aren't insignificant btw. Seems the daemon built transactions that did not pass consensus rules, it should really never do that

[19-May-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I've tested it on usual chain and it looks fine

[19-May-19 07:10 PM] Alright#0419
if it is your tests causing it, try to figure out which values do it, so we can prevent people from doing it via rpc

[19-May-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577
It's very normal RPC calls actually

[19-May-19 07:11 PM] Alright#0419
not familiar enough with channels to see the problem with these

[19-May-19 07:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm trying on real chains with same params and it's fine

[19-May-19 07:11 PM] Alright#0419
but `decoderawtransaction` on them maybe, try to compare them to ones that did work and see what is different

[19-May-19 07:12 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think that's just a regtest fluke is what I'm saying

[19-May-19 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL do you still have that chain?

[19-May-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Which one?

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
the one with channels errors

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
It's regtest chain, actually it's not exists

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Temp chain creating on tests execution which flushing after tests finishing

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
Was just looking at the txs and the code for those errors

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
something wrong with the vin on the second one, wanted to look at the tx

[19-May-19 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
no worries

[19-May-19 08:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Strange is that after PC reboot it's making same calls fine, thats why I'm thinking it's some tests specific problem

[19-May-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
if you do reproduce(no worries if not), please keep the chain

[19-May-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
would like to look at it

Hi, Could `Channels` be considered the same as 0conf in terms of usage?

[19-Oct-19 09:01 AM] gcharang#6833
it is more like lightning without routing problems, but needs a similar commitment of funds towards a receiver

can be used as a replacement for 0conf

[19-Oct-19 09:03 AM] gcharang#6833
and there is no sending to a third person through a person you have a channel open with
there is only sender and receiver, there is no bidirectional flow of funds @CrisF

[19-Oct-19 09:05 AM] gcharang#6833
if you think you will pay your local restaurant 100 KMD in the next month, you can open a channel with them for that amount
after that txn is notarised, you can make payments of any value < 100 KMD to them, that can be considered final the instant the txn hits the mempool

[19-Oct-19 09:07 AM] gcharang#6833
the same channel can be closed and all the remaining coins recovered at any time, will take one notarisation for a channel close too

[19-Oct-19 09:14 AM] CrisF#3405
Do you know if there is any other equivalent to 0conf available to use @gcharang?

[19-Oct-19 09:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm actually looking for a 0conf kind of speed transaction to use with tokens.

[19-Oct-19 09:28 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't think 0conf exists for tokens rn
maybe channels can be updated to include tokens support, I'm not sure

[19-Oct-19 09:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks @gcharang !
I tested tokens for a very short time when it was first developed.  Amazed at the speed.
I'm not sure if `Channels` will suit the project that was asking, but will pass along info on it.
Not sure how many usecases there would be for 0conf speed tokens, but imagine that there would be some.

[19-Oct-19 01:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
Channels already support tokens

[19-Oct-19 01:21 PM] gcharang#6833
oh, then I need to update the docs
wasn't aware of it

@Mihailo which branch/repo is it available in?

[19-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
FSM

[19-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
Probably even in master...

[19-Oct-19 01:27 PM] gcharang#6833
I can't see it in jl777/dev
```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK help | grep channels                                 

channelsaddress pubkey
channelsclose opentxid
channelsinfo [opentxid]
channelsinfo
channelsopen destpubkey numpayments payment
channelspayment opentxid amount [secret]
channelsrefund opentxid closetxid
```
the help output should be different with tokens support correct?
@Mihailo

[19-Oct-19 01:28 PM] gcharang#6833
building FSM now

[19-Oct-19 01:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is there, but it seems it is not in rpc help

[19-Oct-19 01:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for letting me know.

[19-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
Pushed the fix for rcp help

[19-Oct-19 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
in channelsopen the last param is optional - tokenid

The project has a point card app that is can be used form receiving, trading and using points.

[19-Oct-19 01:35 PM] CrisF#3405
They are using 0conf on BCH at the moment.

[19-Oct-19 01:36 PM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if `channels` will work in the same way.

[19-Oct-19 01:38 PM] gcharang#6833
it isn't as straight forward as 0conf @CrisF 
but the usage will be quite similar
the only addition is pre allocation of funds towards a receiver, which will take the time of one notarisation

they will also get on chain orderbook and trade with a Smartchain

[19-Oct-19 01:39 PM] gcharang#6833
if they manage to integrate gateways, they can even trade real crypto for these points on chain

[19-Oct-19 01:41 PM] gcharang#6833
they can even make the base coin very scarce (no public mining) and allocate it to registered customers -- this will restrict the number of transactions a person can do

[19-Oct-19 01:42 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks!  I'll let them know and see what they think.

@Mihailo 
`channelspayment open_tx_id payment_amount (secret)`
how is the `secret` used ?

[19-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Mihailo#5902
Secret is used only when destination issues the payment to itself from the channel. The cases for that is that the payment reached mempool but for some reason haven't been mined and it is gone. So the destination can makenpayment tx and supply the secret from the initial payment.

[19-Oct-19 03:47 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

[19-Oct-19 04:00 PM] gcharang#6833

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts or built something cool using Channels CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. Here's just a sample of #cc-assets

[07-Nov-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo looks like similar hang as for oraclescreate happens with `channelspayment` call
```        # trying to make 0 channel payment
        result = rpc.channelspayment(channel_txid, "0")
        assert_error(result)
    
        # trying to make negative channel payment
>       result = rpc.channelspayment(channel_txid, "-1")
```
and then hang

[07-Nov-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
will try to reproduce manually now

[07-Nov-19 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
reproduced manually

[07-Nov-19 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL channelspayment 15aa84e05b5953fd837e4e6ae4aeb1f1ceaefd0d0f6fc65f492ba40f13d4a7df 0
{

  "error": "invalid payment amount, must be greater than 0"
}
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL channelspayment 15aa84e05b5953fd837e4e6ae4aeb1f1ceaefd0d0f6fc65f492ba40f13d4a7df -1
```
hang, so looks like exactly same thingy as for oracles

[07-Nov-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo @dimxy do you know how to fix all these related hangs? we are putting together a release candidate, so we need all such hangs fixed. hopefully you can find and fix in code

[07-Nov-19 11:52 AM] dimxy#2587
@Mihailo seems this is the similar problem with lock ?

[07-Nov-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think all the recently changed rpc calls needs to be checked

[07-Nov-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the ones changes for nspv or otherwise

[07-Nov-19 12:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I will fix them today

[07-Nov-19 01:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @jl777c @dimxy I made PR that should resolve all RPCs that have new locking mechanism and tehre should not be any blocking now.
