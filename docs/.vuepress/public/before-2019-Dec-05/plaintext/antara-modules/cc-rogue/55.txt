[20-Feb-19 04:55 PM] Alright#0419
import the privkey?

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im a cli noob

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
if you used `setpubkey` command in initial setup, you must run it each time you restart the daemon

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So what command do I use?

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
or when you start komodod, add `-pubkey=<pubkey>` as a param

[20-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I tried something liek that too and think i made it go wacky. let me look real quick.

[20-Feb-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptofist if the privkey of the pubkey you are using is not in your wallet.dat, you need to import the privkey of that address

[20-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504

I got this towards the end of compiling with build-mac.sh:
Making all in doc/man
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
Makefile:1129: warning: overriding commands for target `Agama.dmg'
Makefile:1119: warning: ignoring old commands for target `Agama.dmg'
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all-am'.

Is this expected?

[20-Feb-19 05:13 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, now use `cd src` and start the daemon which should already be compiled and ready in the src dir

download this ^^. extract in a directory and copy all contents to `~/komodo/src` and use `./rogue_tui` from there

[20-Feb-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577

To get warrior to start with you have to start game without warrior first

If your warrior was alive, you had  > 0 gold and killed monster your warrior progress will be saved and appears in warriors list after bailout transaction is mined

[20-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`shift + q`, then y + enter

[20-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
When you're in game and warrior is alive

[20-Feb-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI will broadcast needed transaction automatically

[20-Feb-19 08:06 PM] wookie#7663
and when I restart a single player game, it will pick this saved warrior?

[20-Feb-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, as soon as bailout transaction is mined you'll see warrior in list

[20-Feb-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have any - on next singleplayer game start TUI will print the list and will ask if you want to choose any

[20-Feb-19 08:47 PM] wookie#7663
so when I quit, save warrior, and restart a new single player game with that same warrior, I lose all my gold?

[20-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it gets converted to ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, gold cashing out to ROGUE each time when you quit dungeon. You save only inventory and warrior characteristics

[20-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Your ROGUE total is your scoreboard for the contest too

[20-Feb-19 08:49 PM] wookie#7663
great! thanks!

[20-Feb-19 08:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe *in the future* we can do a contest for best  gold run without dying/exit, to showcase the replay feature or something.

[20-Feb-19 08:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be interesting. Blank warriors multiplayer contests might be kinda cybersport as well üéÆ
