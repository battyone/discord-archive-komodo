Is your version showing "wait 5 seconds" in inventory?

[22-Mar-19 07:53 PM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but not always and somehow still possible pickup more items

[22-Mar-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
For how many levels `rogue.seed.number` were created? Also are there any errors in `cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid` ?

[22-Mar-19 07:58 PM] ronyi#5719
One thing, i was exp issue many times in high level i think

[22-Mar-19 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi Hmm by replay it seems like bug is the same / similar

[22-Mar-19 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
You starting to randomly run in one room on lvl13

[22-Mar-19 08:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe there are still some moments without focus

[22-Mar-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker maybe we just remove that extra display part totally? it is optional data and losing player progress is much worse

[22-Mar-19 08:14 PM] ronyi#5719
Tomorrow i testing agin and creating gameplay, sorry now i can't. I don't know import or not, but the wait 5s message not always printed the full inventory sometimes just 2 items.

[22-Mar-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
We can always make max amount of letters less I wonder so there will be only one screen

[22-Mar-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to remove the strenght prints and make sure it never goes to second screen

[22-Mar-19 08:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe it's possible to not accept movement keystrokes when this screen is active

[22-Mar-19 08:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I saw no strength prints on latest

[22-Mar-19 08:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a: if screen is active - can only watch and keyboard handlers aren't active

[22-Mar-19 08:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, player have to press space 😃

[22-Mar-19 08:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I've noticed now when played that sometimes I'm getting 2 pages, sometimes 1 with same inventory - but can't reproduce reliably. Maybe just one was with prints and one without

[22-Mar-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we can change things to just never get the second screen. increase the LINES (screen height) if needed

[22-Mar-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I hope that there are no other unknown cases when some inputs which not moving warrior reading like moment keystrokes rather than inventory

[22-Mar-19 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Just interesting - is there some handling which can distinguish between `l` movement keystroke and usage of item which have `l` letter in inventory?

[22-Mar-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is based on context

[22-Mar-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe decker can go through the code looking for any other possible causes of losing focus

[22-Mar-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I've lost 2 levels but I hadn't cases when 2 space press were needed

[22-Mar-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe there are places which just counting presses when it not moving warrior

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but why does it behave differently when using gui vs replay?

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Because key press is recorded

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
there are half a dozen to a dozen if ( rs->guiflag != 0 ) type of special cases

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the answer is in those

[22-Mar-19 08:27 PM] TonyL#3577
If one movement keypress which actually not moving warrior is recorded somewhere - all next progress will be lost

[22-Mar-19 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Keystrokes just replaying on this level and warrior moving to where he able to move with others levels keystrokes

[22-Mar-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810

any idea when it got out of sync?

[22-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Will watch it slow-mo now - but will take some time because there is 30min+ gameplay

[22-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it possible to start replay from specific level?

[22-Mar-19 11:06 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[22-Mar-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but you could change the sleeptime to a much slower value based on level

[22-Mar-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just set rs->sleeptime = 1000000; after N keystrokes

Then starting moving around randomly

[22-Mar-19 11:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Quite hard to say what happened without actual gameplay

[22-Mar-19 11:33 PM] TonyL#3577
But these jumps and strange appearing on lvl13 - now it seems like a different issue (not just not connected with map movement because of illegally recorded keystrokes)

[22-Mar-19 11:35 PM] TonyL#3577
There is even no print about some action in the end of lvl12. He just stept on this wand, then moved right and then lvl13 started (started very not-correct way as it seems on screenshots)

[22-Mar-19 11:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Since ronyi had memcorruption on his macbook before - maybe it's related hmm

[22-Mar-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
And then when he running randomly - such symbols sometimes appears

I think there weren't such behaviour with bug which Decker fixed. So it's something different

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
another non-det!

[22-Mar-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
seems only one game had this issue so far, so that is a good success rate actually

[23-Mar-19 07:17 AM] ronyi#5719
I played now one game lvl 1-23 and now extracted fine, ~40min. I playing more long games, but so much time, i hope soon produced gameplay video with bug. Ohh 120 ROGUE in one game, not bad.

Uploaded video, @TonyL, in lvl9 possible to see 63 items in my inventory(13:52), but strenght "only" 31. I used this game 3gain strenght potions, but not worked i thing max strenght=31. Another (35:47) fighting with G and give me more than 2000 exp, this is normal? In previus game fighted with V and in warrior lvl 13 max hp is 91, but after first V my life point is 88 and after the next V is 86 and never restored to 91. So V is a real vampire. 😄
