@ronyi could you please remind your pubkey to try?

Extracted succesfully

[13-Mar-19 02:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm if you not imported you privkey / setup same wallet.dat and pubkey on OSX - this game was played on Ubuntu I wonder

[13-Mar-19 02:11 PM] ronyi#5719
checking whether the linker accepts -Wl,-z,relro... no
configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO
Ohh, i stuid, used ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc).... sorry

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, on Ubuntu game replay finishing with `586 gold`
In `extract` print ```"extracted": "$$$gold.620 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6"```

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
620 vs 586 hmm

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's check on OSX when it build

[13-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Happens @ronyi

ðŸ˜„ 

[13-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I bet that on OSX game ends with 620 ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Mar-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Finished build

[13-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the 620 vs 586 was the difference, the question is what is different about the replay on osx

[13-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and i wonder what windows does

[13-Mar-19 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh - would be interesting to check it on windows as well yep

[13-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if windows is 620, maybe it is the unix that is wrong

[13-Mar-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
ROGUE on OSX continued to sync after 50901 block reconsidering

[13-Mar-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Brb in 10 minutes and will compare replays of this game from 3 platforms

[13-Mar-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
in the io.c if ( 0 ) statement you can log the player gold amount

[13-Mar-19 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Synced OSX fine
```"extracted": "$$$gold.586 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6"```

[13-Mar-19 02:32 PM] ronyi#5719
10.14.4 beta 5 update started

[13-Mar-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
On windows it's ` "extracted": "$$$gold.620 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6",` 620 same as on unix - but I have FSM daemon without latest fixes on both unix and windows

[13-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Wow, on windows replay ends with 620 gold

[13-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Only platform on which it ends with 620 gold

[13-Mar-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi try to`brew install libidn2`

[13-Mar-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c it seems that at the moment full replay playing only on windows

[13-Mar-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
And I'm using Deckers `rogue` here

[13-Mar-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
deckers build likely doesnt have the latest code

[13-Mar-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
`rogue` itself he sent me tonight

[13-Mar-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
daemon is pretty old FSM on both unix and win

[13-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i merged his fixes in, so any new build will have latest

[13-Mar-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see

[13-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
without the most recent, it will say 620

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to update daemons to latest jl777 on all three platforms so

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
with the latest, 586 or maybe 620, or maybe latest is fixed on all?

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to update all platforms first - have latest jl777 only on OSX at the moment

[13-Mar-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so osx "extracted": "$$$gold.586 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6"
then the bug could be fixed

[13-Mar-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe the gameplay for that game had 620...

[13-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes - thats what I'm thinking about

[13-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Because on Windows it's not just printing 620 when I'm replaying

[13-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
There were more keystrokes actually

[13-Mar-19 02:44 PM] TonyL#3577

you have the .1, .2, ... files for the game?

[13-Mar-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it just missed the last keystrokes, that would explain the different gold,but all else matches so it seems just missed 34 gold

[13-Mar-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Only .0

[13-Mar-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to have played it locally to have the .1+ files

[13-Mar-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
ronyi played this one - so maybe he have on one of his machines

[13-Mar-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
But .0 ending with Qy on all platforms

[13-Mar-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess in io.c add gold to the log print

[13-Mar-19 03:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Is gold recording in `rogue_state` as purse?

[13-Mar-19 03:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Not played with this code so far

[13-Mar-19 03:13 PM] TonyL#3577
``` c = rs->keystrokes[rs->ind++];
            if ( 1 )
```
Changed to 1, make clean, make - but don't see any new prints on replay

[13-Mar-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it goes into a file called "log"

Ouch, unix is latest jl777 too

[13-Mar-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
probably need to put in long sleeps at 2938 to see if there is a * where the j would move the player

[13-Mar-19 03:29 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm doing a little bit different way - recording screen and then checking frame by frame

[13-Mar-19 03:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me check

[13-Mar-19 03:32 PM] TonyL#3577

[13-Mar-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810

that is the critical point

[13-Mar-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so if it got to 6, then maybe the room is different ?

[13-Mar-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
On unix it showing now 620 gold in log but replay ending on lvl5:

So only OSX showing broken room - as was expected

[13-Mar-19 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
And I'm 100% sure that this broken room is the last frame in replay on OSX (using software on macbook by which I can rewind by 0.01 seconds to catch moment where replay ends)

[13-Mar-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will look into this one

seems the only reproducible gameplay bug we have?

[13-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm even not sure how to reproduce it manually

[13-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Ronyi lost many warriors on long games re-usage

[13-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But I think that better to try with updated software now

[13-Mar-19 04:01 PM] TonyL#3577
If some edge cases were caught on rpc side + some changes in rogue from Decker - maybe  less non-det bugs here now

[13-Mar-19 04:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, also I saw PR regards mem leak in CCFinalizeTX - there were errors with CCFinalizeTX print before

[13-Mar-19 04:14 PM] TonyL#3577
So I'll proceed with Ubuntu and Win bundles for now

treasure (2) 

[13-Mar-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and ok to make osx bundle too as it is only one game with this issue, but make it last

ðŸ‘Œ 

[13-Mar-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
duplicated issue. on osx crazy level 6, on unix it is normal

[13-Mar-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
such an issue could certainly explain the lost warriors issue. does ronyi use osx for most his games?
