If extract return "error" I maybe will block bailout option at all

[02-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Bailout with extract returning "error" = insta death as it seems

[02-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi updated singleplayer TUI is in master branch üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes the bailout monster there is no magic to defend against

[02-Mar-19 08:02 AM] ronyi#5719
so i can't make a long game, lvl 7 warrior dead again and I just quit. In updating my test plan continuously. Okay i update now. Just TUI or/and komodo?

[02-Mar-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Just new JSONs outputs not beatified in TUI yet - because at first want to check that it work as expected if see keystroke with error on broadcast

[02-Mar-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Just TUI update is fine I think - since your last update only debug info was added

[02-Mar-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
And TUI work now only with keystrokes.log so you should be fine

[02-Mar-19 08:05 AM] TonyL#3577
It should show something like this now

If you press `n` it will just wait 10 secs and print you extraction info again

[02-Mar-19 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
If status of extraction info "Error" - bailout will kill warrior üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if we catch keystroke with error in status - in such case TUI should print smthng like a:
```print("Trying to re-brodcast keystroke")```
``` print("Let's try again in 5 seconds")```
```print("Keystroke broadcasted! txid: " + keystroke_rebroadcast["txid"])```
Tested it on "synthetic file" but never with real game yet üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i am actually surprised things worked as well as they did before without any checking at all

especially since 100% confirmation of all keystrokes tx was required for success

[02-Mar-19 08:09 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay then i press alwasy "n" üòÑ

[02-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
I've rescued one time warrior @ronyi - just pressed `n` 3 times (waited 30 secs) - then he extracted fine

[02-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Then bailout - tadam alive üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 08:12 AM] ronyi#5719
in tui git checkout rogue and git pull ?

[02-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, it's in master

[02-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
So `git checkout master` `git pull`

[02-Mar-19 08:12 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay

[02-Mar-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm using `rogue` branch only for code syncing between hello kitty node and VPS

[02-Mar-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that hello kitty bug is still spooking me... it is like some sort of consistent memory corruption

[02-Mar-19 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
When I saw it - I thought that I went crazy or something like this üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if it still has that behavior, would be good for me to remote in and troubleshoot it. the last hang had me looking in all the wrong places for a while, maybe it is again something happening inside the rogue daemon code that is overwriting memory

[02-Mar-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Game counted not as warrior dead - ROGUE sending to me - warriors not to me

[02-Mar-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but it was in a consistent way

[02-Mar-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the mypk variable was being changed

[02-Mar-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
even though it wasnt changed

[02-Mar-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
No, after I rebuilt - everything fine

[02-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
oh! so the hello kitty was due to running some rogue.c files using old struct. ok that will corrupt memory indeed

[02-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i wont be spooked out anymore, thanks!

[02-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810

It's most plausible explanation that just one of executables was not up to date, yep

[02-Mar-19 08:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Glad that you're not spooked anymore!

[02-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the rogue makefile of the dapp is not very smart, so if the rogue.h file changes, it doesnt recompile all the files, even though all of them are needed a global structure

[02-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it even runs, some modules are writing at one location, while others are using a different one, for the same variable.

[02-Mar-19 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmmm we may hardcode `make clean` in rogue folder in makerogue script let's say

[02-Mar-19 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it have sense?

Try to wait few times

[02-Mar-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Keystroke rebroadcasting helped to avoid this `"error":"couldnt find batontxid"`

[02-Mar-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
But your keystrokes broadcasted fine - just need to wait one block maybe

[02-Mar-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I think I'll change this "waiting for 10 more seconds" to "waiting for next block"

[02-Mar-19 08:56 AM] ronyi#5719
More than 2 block mined, but same messages.

[02-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh if you was killed - extract returning error permanently now if I remember correct

[02-Mar-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Just printing in stdout something like a `zero value character or killed` and "Error" in extract output

[02-Mar-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
So you can bailout - I not noticed first that you was killed

[02-Mar-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577

[02-Mar-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that enables enforcement for playerdata at height 50000, this gives a week for the nodes to update. still there isnt full validation so not ready for hacking attempts yet. once the gameplay is proven stable, then the full validation (and dPoW) will be added

There are many in keystrokes.log and all without errors

[02-Mar-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
seems some nondeterministic player action still plauges us... maybe an extract needs to be done at each level to make sure things are in sync? at least to debug

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes some thing should corrupt replay

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a fix so that if you have amulet, it treats it at least as level 26, even if you are lower

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I think weared ring first time on ~dl5

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it is being confirmed level by level,at least you will know when things get out of sync and can bailout at that time

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
So my only idea that it's corrupted from place where I put ring

[02-Mar-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be the informational commands, that get things out of sync
