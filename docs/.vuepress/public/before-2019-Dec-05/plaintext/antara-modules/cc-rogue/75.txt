[01-Mar-19 05:38 AM] TonyL#3577
It's correct, I checked it first

[01-Mar-19 05:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Node on which I faced issue is OSX, and node on which I wasn't able to reproduce is Ubuntu if it might matter somehow

[01-Mar-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so this node, it is wearing any cursed rings?

[01-Mar-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
drink any strange potions?

[01-Mar-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
from what you are saying it seems quite strange. it is able to create a new warrior to the correct address, but if you are playing with an existing one, it goes to a random address?

[01-Mar-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
these playertxid you are using, where did they come from?

[01-Mar-19 05:41 AM] TonyL#3577
No I played 5 short games first - warriors created, then reused these 5 warriors

[01-Mar-19 05:42 AM] TonyL#3577
And they disappear

[01-Mar-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so it creates them fine, but on a reused one goes to a random address and it happens only on this node

[01-Mar-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
what if you use the same keypair on a different node. maybe it is keypair specific

[01-Mar-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that any keypair on that node will do the same

[01-Mar-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
some sort of memory corruption going on

[01-Mar-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
did you make clean and make from ~/komodo/src/cc/rogue dir?

[01-Mar-19 05:44 AM] TonyL#3577
I think I did, let me try to clean everything, rebuild and reproduce

[01-Mar-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so my guess is the waiting for sendrawtranasction to fail is causing problems, but otherwise keystrokes is more reliable. just at the end can cause a hang

[01-Mar-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
for bailout hangs, get me the cclib args for an external extract, where you have the address or pubkey in addition to the gametxid. that should almost certainly reproduce any looping on baton search

[01-Mar-19 05:51 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22,%220325151cf0f7321d0cde232898c5adc6b60f32df71b79af3a49d10020d42925ae9%22]\"
```

[01-Mar-19 05:52 AM] TonyL#3577
(It happened on @ronyi side so I've used pubkey which he provided before - this extract hanged my node)

[01-Mar-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
great! i just need such examples, but one per type of bug is enough

[01-Mar-19 06:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Cleaned everything and rebuilt - not able to reproduce this warriors disappearing issue atm. 
So since it's happened only for me and only on this node and not reproducible now I assume it was cursed ring or most probably hello kitty fault

[01-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that extract infinite loop seems to be a hello kitty monster too... cant even find where it is hanging

[01-Mar-19 07:01 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay, I trying to rebuild my node and import my priv key. Deleted .komodo and komodo dirs.

[01-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
use FSM branch

[01-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 has a zillion printouts

[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] ronyi#5719

[01-Mar-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Connection reset by peer means that daemon hangs. Do you have game txid?

[01-Mar-19 08:58 AM] ronyi#5719

It's deadlock - maybe it's same case as about which you've reported before (James not fixed it yet I think)

[01-Mar-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe when James find the root of deadlocks your warriors will be rescued

[01-Mar-19 11:04 AM] ronyi#5719
And leather armor is the best (my option, I had no problem with more and more"A"  up to now).

[01-Mar-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Ring of armor sustain is cool

[01-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Are `A` not reducing leather armor at all?

[01-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's good idea to enhance leather armor if they aren't 🤔

[01-Mar-19 11:10 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes

[01-Mar-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL finally solved it, was infinite looping in the replay. it seems the warrior died but the keystrokes maybe was messed up and that ended up in an infinite loop. found half a dozen other places where it might happen and hopefully it is prevented

Regards rings - if I remember correct negative number means you will need more food, positive number means that less
