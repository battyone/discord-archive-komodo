On the beginning of next level

[24-Mar-19 06:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Usually it happens on late levels, one time I had it on level3

[24-Mar-19 06:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Ronyi got it on lvl16 when moved back upstairs with amulet

[24-Mar-19 06:32 PM] TonyL#3577
```"batontxid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"``` causing this negative vout if I understand correct

[24-Mar-19 06:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it have wait for something if baton not found

[24-Mar-19 06:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it caused bad internet connection + fast level switch. So if it looking for previous one  right here right now - it can't find it. Also blocks time is not consistent

[24-Mar-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
But I was able to reproduce it on OSX only

[24-Mar-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
An just checked ronyi video - it seems that ronyi played on OSX too

[24-Mar-19 06:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to go back and forth for amulet on Ubuntu now (grabbing 1000 txfee fix - so also will check if it changed). Just like keyboard on Mac Air so played from it today 😃

[24-Mar-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
On ubuntu catched as well

[24-Mar-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
After changed levels two times very fast

[24-Mar-19 06:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe 5-10 seconds was on each level (stairs were in same room where I appeared)

[24-Mar-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, and keystrokes tx are triggered each time you change levels, at least it checks things

[24-Mar-19 06:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, print appears immideatly after level change

[24-Mar-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
let me make it skip that if it was too fast

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Mar-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI will wait until last keystroke tx have confirmations on blockchain anyway

[24-Mar-19 07:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So keystroke txs might be queued by rogue I  wonder (broadcast next after previous is mined and not finish rogue process until last is broadcasted)

[24-Mar-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Because there might be edge case if I change levels fast befroe quit - even if you'll handle zero baton - last keystroke will not be rebrodcasted because rogue exited

[24-Mar-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for all but the last keystrokes processing, i make sure it has been 5 minutes since the prior one

[24-Mar-19 07:04 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI rebroadcasting now keystrokes only in case of error in keystrokes.log, but hmm can check few last keystrokes on blockchain as well and rebroadcast in order if needed before extract/bailout

[24-Mar-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
last keystrokes should get sent, but yes, likely some edge cases possible, can be seen via difference in extracted keystrokes vs local

[24-Mar-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the way to reproduce the 000000 baton is likely to very quickly do new levels

[24-Mar-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed version that will hopefully make keystrokes much more stable

{Reactions}
👍 

[24-Mar-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm thinking now that can solve it from TUI side anyway (if after rebroadcasting attempt keystroke which generated negative vout will return not negative in case of previous keystroke mined)

[24-Mar-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
this bug would explain the lvl 13 bug ronyi had

[24-Mar-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think he had the same

[24-Mar-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and it seems this is the only strange behavior we have seen with the latest, the 5 minute setback should make it really really rare

[24-Mar-19 07:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Updating

[24-Mar-19 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
How it should behave if I'll decide to quit on lvl1 lets say? (point of question are games less than 5 minutes length)

[24-Mar-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the last one is sent out (as is the first one) or at least it should

[24-Mar-19 08:47 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL I just played a long game this morning, got to level 18 where I quit.
Game txid: 59ecb6f8ab442fcb4fe2984876223f9a590e8bd920954bd338a35f42c071e7f4
Information about game saved on chain: $$$gold.4858 hp.69 strength.19/20 level.11 exp.5800 dl.18


 I kept waiting for the bailout but kept getting: 
Bailout not on blockchain yet. Let's wait a little bit more
getrawtransaction: No information available about transaction (code -5)

after 3 hours, I finally ctrl+c, then did manual bailout: 
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/5ndKdzyrfx/
this was the daemon output:
extracted $$$gold.4858 -> 42.48029520 ROGUE hp.69 strength.19/20 level.11 exp.5800 dl.18 n.1 amulet.0
59ecb6f8ab442fcb4fe2984876223f9a590e8bd920954bd338a35f42c071e7f4 good.6 bad.0

But it's not in the blockchain, my address has no ROGUES from this. So I tried manual bailout again and got this: 
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "bailout",
  "myrogueaddr": "RPD4UAn8MSVSkcCWfWsowdEgY4BdjxmGsX",

  "error": "couldnt finalize CCtx"
}
this was the output from the daemon screen:
extracted $$$gold.4858 -> 42.48029520 ROGUE hp.69 strength.19/20 level.11 exp.5800 dl.18 n.1 amulet.0

And I've not recorded video of original gameplay 😦 There is some non det I think - in replay stairs on level two definetly not on same place where they were in original game. I think it might be some interference with way back

[24-Mar-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577

[24-Mar-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think issue is definerly that I've actually quit trough stairs in other place on lvl2 - but in replay stairs in other position

@wookie Hmm it seems like a pubkey missmatch.
Could you please try to `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress RPD4UAn8MSVSkcCWfWsowdEgY4BdjxmGsX` and the check if pubkey in this call output match pubkey which you have in `getinfo` output?

[24-Mar-19 09:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, or maybe pubkey for this `RPD4UAn8MSVSkcCWfWsowdEgY4BdjxmGsX` address should be set

I stopped the daemon then restarted it but I got this error:

I haven't done anything else on my computer or anything crypto related in the last 48 hours other than playing rogue. not sure how it got corrupted.

I was able to stop daemon then restarted once again. going to test a short game now.
