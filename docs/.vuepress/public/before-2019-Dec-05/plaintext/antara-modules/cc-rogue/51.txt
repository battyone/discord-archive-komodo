Cool working on it

[19-Feb-19 08:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Does the ``make clean`` command work on dishes?

[19-Feb-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
`make clean` cleaning previous build

[19-Feb-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
It should work recursive from komodod folder so will clean rogue build as well

[19-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok awesome

[19-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
you shot my joke down **hard**

[19-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
üòÉ

[19-Feb-19 09:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504
so its clean and rebuilding

[19-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm very sorry

[19-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
`make clean` just cleaning `build.sh` building

[19-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it can build building as well, not sure

[19-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
just learned .sh is a script

[19-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
whats .py before i google it.

[19-Feb-19 09:01 PM] TonyL#3577
*gave you a chance to shot my joke as well*

[19-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[19-Feb-19 09:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup

Warriors asks scanner not working (not detecting any asks) but issue is not tui code since on old version which worked before it's not working as well

[19-Feb-19 09:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe something was changed in TokensCC

[19-Feb-19 09:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I need to learn more about Crypto-Condtions, I fell like ultimately that is what we are promoting here.

[19-Feb-19 09:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
trying to figure that out... I think i got it....

[19-Feb-19 09:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That?

[19-Feb-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, run it from `~/komodo/src`

[19-Feb-19 09:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Awesome, I am excited that I actually knew.

[19-Feb-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
```but linux is like +0 +0 1d8```
Definitely more now üòÉ

[19-Feb-19 09:10 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
right. i can play and bail out and get rewards but the tui says that i dont have any warriors even if i create one. is that a problem on my side?

[19-Feb-19 09:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
hmmm do I have a bonus modifier over the average person as far as using linux as a skill set. ü§î

[19-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Linux +1,+0 1d20

[19-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@sgt-pot-smoker  Sometimes it needs some time before it will load, but if you are repeating the process over and over

[19-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it may be.

[19-Feb-19 09:12 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
ok ty

[19-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Doing everything tony and I just went over may be a solution

[19-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im sorry to hear that, losing warriors, sucks.

[19-Feb-19 09:13 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
its just popped up as i have 1 now. so thats cool. ive only just got it running. started 8 hr ago lmao just doing bailouts on lvl 3 checking its working before i put time into it

[19-Feb-19 09:15 PM] TonyL#3577
There might be different reasons (you have not updated daemon and not passing some new validations, you died, you tried to quit without mosnters killing and gold collecting)

[19-Feb-19 09:15 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i only started on linux last week so im guessing its deffo down to me lol

[19-Feb-19 09:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you update your komodod since last week?

[19-Feb-19 09:17 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
yes many times today XD

[19-Feb-19 09:17 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i have a warrior now so hoping its all ok

[19-Feb-19 09:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah also one more reason - warrior appears in list after bailout transaction is mined

[19-Feb-19 09:18 PM] TonyL#3577
If there any pending games you may find it manually by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17`

[19-Feb-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
And try to execute bailout manually by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"` to try to rescue the warrior

[19-Feb-19 09:19 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
ty ill save those now

[19-Feb-19 09:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Tried creating a multiplayer game and got this. - Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./rogue_tui.py", line 89, in <module>

[19-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Something changed in validation (before it gave seed immediately)

[19-Feb-19 09:20 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
game tx 82c3274c6bd93a4cc04b71067102da27d6e5b0e527612a8d5d72823d8fa213ca

[19-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
I need to adjust TUI for it

[19-Feb-19 09:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok

[19-Feb-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to start this game again in 5 blocks

[19-Feb-19 09:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok will do

[19-Feb-19 09:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Now working

[19-Feb-19 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so seed showing after 5 blocks now - will add validation and game status field in list

[19-Feb-19 09:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Found out why `Check if somebody selling warrior` not showing orders atm.
 Validation in warriors scanner connected to specific txout to check if it dead. But if warrior placed in sell order on marketplace scanner detecting him as dead as well üòÉ Things starting to be interesting

[19-Feb-19 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Fixed this and also added some flags which showing if game is ready to start or not in multiplayer games start menu (also it shouldn't crash if you try to start not ready game). Updates are in TUI `rogue` branch

Using Ubuntu app for Windows 10, installed easy this time.

üëç 

[19-Feb-19 10:07 PM] TonyL#3577
So you can start game in 5 blocks after creation

[19-Feb-19 10:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But now TUI will indicate ready games

[19-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Layout of dungeon is broken though, any ideas?

[19-Feb-19 10:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
AND AWESOME about multiplayer!

[19-Feb-19 10:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to `Ctrl + R` - if it not help I don't know üòÇ

[19-Feb-19 10:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure how this Ubuntu app drawing things

[19-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
lol made it way worse. hahaha

[19-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I wish i could just drop screenshots here

[19-Feb-19 10:38 PM] nael55#5863
just slayed my first krestel

[19-Feb-19 10:39 PM] nael55#5863
this is cool. there's a game called ladder slasher that it reminds me of. https://ladderslasher.d2jsp.org/

[20-Feb-19 12:07 AM] joe2x4#5987
Am having a hard time getting the game going again. I've been through the guide. Am using the TUI. Hit 6. Says game transaction is mined. No players available to select. Something went wrong. 
 Any ideas of what I'm doing wrong.

[20-Feb-19 12:12 AM] joe2x4#5987
Hmm, looks like the chain might not have started correctly.  "Error: cannot obtain a lock on data directory, Komodo is probably all ready running."

[20-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Congrats  @nael55 !!! Welcome to the guild! üòâ

[20-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@joe2x4  Any luck?

[20-Feb-19 01:48 AM] joe2x4#5987
No so far. I was just going through the guide step by step with a new copy of ubunty. Not sure what I messed up.

[20-Feb-19 01:51 AM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe the chain never loaded correctly. Trying to redo and is saying that Komodo is already running. Not sure how to stop the chain. Maybe I just nuke the os and restart from 0

[20-Feb-19 02:16 AM] joe2x4#5987
What should screen say when the chain has started properly?

[20-Feb-19 02:25 AM] joe2x4#5987
Yeah, it's hung on loading the chain. Address Good.65 bad.23

[20-Feb-19 02:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sorry I poppe din and out, I am back now.

[20-Feb-19 02:57 AM] Alright#0419
what's the simplest way to get a windows noob up and running? Linux subsystem with ubuntu?

[20-Feb-19 02:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Alright  yeah i think so.

[20-Feb-19 02:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
VM of ubuntu has worked best for me.

[20-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
having the same issue as joe here ^ though on my one machine

[20-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Im going to have to make a trouble;e shooting for testing guide

[20-Feb-19 02:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@joe2x4  it might be running

[20-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Cryptofist#7504
can you open a new terminal? then ```cd ~/komodo/src
./rogue_tui.py
```

[20-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If you installed TUI and it is runing, that should lead you to a game

[20-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
You need to start a new single player game if you have no warrior tokens

[20-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
I think simplest way for windows noob may be a remote daemon that Tony's TUI connects to

[20-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
going to try it, if it works, I might be able to host other instances for people

[20-Feb-19 03:05 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so I also have the same problems.
No warrior tokens to select from or see in TUI
```
Game is finished!

Something went wrong
-'txid'-
```

[20-Feb-19 03:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Alright  that would be super super eamazing!

[20-Feb-19 03:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Could you somehow screencap record that being set up? That would be an excellent learning asset.

[20-Feb-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL have you tried this TUI on windows yet?

[20-Feb-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
having a lot of pycurl problems, not sure where to go from here

[20-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
`command python setup.py egg_info failed with error code 10` when I try `pip3 install slick-bitcoinrpc`
