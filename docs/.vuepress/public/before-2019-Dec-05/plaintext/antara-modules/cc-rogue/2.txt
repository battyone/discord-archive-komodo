[07-Feb-19 09:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It looks like @Mylo is on top of alot of it already.  

I pinged @minerwizard - I believe that GUI dev work is the main line of work for this user.

You know me, anyway I can help, let me know. üëç

Hey everyone üëã If there is any GUI work needed let me know üòÉ Or if someone working on it needs some help, also cool!

[07-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Mylo#8306
@FishyGuts not as much as i'd like.   it's a new collaboration so results might vary.   although with the unity store asset pretty much out of the box simple GUI, it might be an easy integration but it might not be worth it.  multiple GUIs would be interesting though.   also what would be interesting is a % of ROGUE going to the cclib dev or a % going to the GUI dev.    with many GUIs, and with a popular game, it could really become a passionate contest of artwork etc.   add in some VR for the same game blockchain artifacts then you really have different experiences for everyone.   it's another new angle to amazing tech...

[07-Feb-19 09:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Strob has knowledge in 3d graphics and assets.  Perhaps he can help or knows someone to refer you to for your needs.

[07-Feb-19 10:22 PM] Strob#3417
Yes I could maybe help. So there will be some graphics in that blockchain game?

[07-Feb-19 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, graphics required for the GUI.

[07-Feb-19 10:34 PM] SHossain#0007
CLI version just uses symbols and letters to play

[07-Feb-19 11:56 PM] ca333#0118
btw @SHossain - there is the `rogue.html` in src/cc/rogue which might be of a help.

[07-Feb-19 11:56 PM] ca333#0118
(and everyone else)

[07-Feb-19 11:58 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. it is helpful. also, there is another file https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue/rogue.doc

and for anyone who wants to build a GUI a good starting point might be (gameloop):
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue/rogue.c#L217 - just start debugging from here and you will understand the whole logic within one run.

@SHossain about the part in your guide where you set a new pubkey, there is an actual RPC called `setpubkey`. you don't have to restart the daemon anymore. so it's just a matter of `getnewaddress`, `validateaddress` and then `setpubkey <pubkey>` and you're good to go.
