[16-Feb-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you forgot to build

[16-Feb-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
from ~/komodo:
zcutil/build.sh

[16-Feb-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case komodod is in ~/komodo/src

[16-Feb-19 05:46 PM] TonyL#3577
```cd ~/komodo/src```
And then last command from screenshot should do a trick

[16-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So thats where the trouble is every time.

[16-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So there IS something else to do? I started from the top and did every point each time....

[16-Feb-19 05:49 PM] TonyL#3577
On screenshot you're trying to run daemon from folder where is no daemon
Try to do:
```cd ~/komodo/src/
./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon```

[16-Feb-19 05:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, unless it told me to change i didnt change

[16-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
so ```cd ~/komodo/src/``` needs to be in the guide?  or  .... something else?  
Am I somehow using the wrong directory?

[16-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
did that ran the command, yay progress.

[16-Feb-19 05:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
is the daemon supposed to be in komodo?

[16-Feb-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm actually yes since `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` executing from `~/komodo`

[16-Feb-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
So after `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`
`cd src` is needed

[16-Feb-19 05:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Because daemon placing in src folder

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't realise. thanks for noticing. updated the guide

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Could someone please take a hard look at the guide and figure out the point of failure here and update it?

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
yay!

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, so next, lets see if my 6 yeard old can install

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] TonyL#3577
We're just call daemon so much in everyday work so not realised that there might be problem on this stage üòÉ

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I know, all good.

[16-Feb-19 05:57 PM] SHossain#0007
now, more noob proof. thanks to you

[16-Feb-19 05:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Its my favorite thing to do

[16-Feb-19 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
exactly @TonyL . overlooked that part

[16-Feb-19 05:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I had wondered if it was a case of you guys being so used to something that it wasn't noticed, that happens a lot i think, in this space.

[16-Feb-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Nice that now you're closer to game start üòÉ So did daemon started on your side?

[16-Feb-19 06:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
yep and i am on the get an address part

[16-Feb-19 06:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptofist i'll update the guide now for you to be able to play the TUI easily

[16-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Then its going on twitch

[16-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Thinking of doing a multiplayer demo on twitch/youtube, ill need to figure out how to bring both feeds to one screen.

[16-Feb-19 06:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Multiplayer isn't tested yet - better to start from singleplayer trainings and strong warriors preparing

[16-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
*later

[16-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
its a promotional idea, def not doing it today

[16-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Announce stream demo, hype said event, do said event

[16-Feb-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be cool to stream on twitch yeah - some PVP game. Both players broadcast - split screen in stream and commentator üòÉ

[16-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
today i just want to play at my leisure, set it up on two other computers, show my family how to play, make them farm with me. lol

[16-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
yep exactly!

[16-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
single screen of multiple screens

[16-Feb-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Somebody commenting trolls attacks and unexpected traps would be fun

[16-Feb-19 06:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was looking into video broadcasting and such for the last few weeks to make some good KMD eco-sytem content.

[16-Feb-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Chain is syncing now but it's ok - you can restart with pubkey and sync just continue

[16-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
so new terminal ... or a command?

[16-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504

i think

[16-Feb-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
If daemon prints make you stressed you can open new terminal, do `cd ~/komodo/src` and then follow guides above

[16-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok, but whats the mormal way ? just enter the command?

[16-Feb-19 06:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
normal*

[16-Feb-19 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c one gamer asking me if there is any time limit or abuse protection for macro or auto bots playing the game?

[16-Feb-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist Not sure what you mean by normal way. You need to execute commands from guides in terminal in `~/komodo/src` folder

[16-Feb-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
All you need to get now is pubkey from validateaddress step

[16-Feb-19 06:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I meant do I just enter the commands in terminal while it prints or do I need to stop it to enter a command

[16-Feb-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes just enter commands while it prints

[16-Feb-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it is expected that eventually bots will start playing for now it seems there are no bots

@TonyL I made an extract method, pass in gametxid and it saves the keystokes to a seed.0 file, also it tries to replay the game.

[16-Feb-19 06:25 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks.

[16-Feb-19 06:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
JL at some point yesterday I wondered how easy it would be to make a farming bot for this game

[16-Feb-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it works, you can get the seed.0 file and use ./rogue seed to replay it

[16-Feb-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
might just crash though,untested

Could you please execute:
