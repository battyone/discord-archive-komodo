@jl777c I built latest jl777 and there is no `extract` method in cclibinfo and also:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22bfd60866bead58adedb3bd9e453d2f29964bfb29a2d73782f5e90199b08d8d6f%22]\"
error: couldn't parse reply from server```
UPD see it was added in last commit

[16-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
*is finally playing this version of this fekkin game*

[16-Feb-19 07:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Kill em all! üòÉ

[16-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So the monsters and items keep shifting on each move

[16-Feb-19 07:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
went from A - B - S -O

[16-Feb-19 07:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I didnt really notcie it for abit, thought the dragon on the first floor was a bit strange

[16-Feb-19 07:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
same for items

[16-Feb-19 07:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
i got some screenshots, its each move, its crazy.

[16-Feb-19 07:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
its a pain to upload  here but can PM if someone wants to see

[16-Feb-19 07:13 PM] TonyL#3577
You can DM me

[16-Feb-19 07:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
oooh making new staircases too

[16-Feb-19 07:14 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c replay deadlocked my daemon since there is deadlock replay in the end üòÇ

[16-Feb-19 07:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
move til gold item market appears. ‚úÖ

[16-Feb-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but hopefully the seed.0 file is there. fixing rogue dapp to replay such files

[16-Feb-19 07:19 PM] TonyL#3577
```2435066866563560542.0``` file is there

[16-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
updated a version that makes the right fname and adds delay so you can see the replay

[16-Feb-19 07:24 PM] TonyL#3577
How to start rogue properly to run replay from file?

[16-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you can extract again or just add "rogue." in front of that file

[16-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
./rogue <seed>

[16-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
./rogue 2435066866563560542

[16-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
above (from cc/rogue) or cc/rogue/rogue 2435066866563560542

[16-Feb-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that should replay the game, so you can see where it goes into infinite loop

I HAVE DEFEATED THE DRAGON on lvl 2....

[16-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[16-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
dragon?

[16-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
something is very wrong if you see dragon on level 2

[16-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
yep

[16-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
random is super broken on my game

[16-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL can you share my screenshots here?

[16-Feb-19 07:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Each time I move my warrior, mosters change and items change

gold to staircase to potion to armor to ring

[16-Feb-19 07:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
same for monsters, which i also seem to just thwart if i hit them

[16-Feb-19 07:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
they shift between type on each hit or move

[16-Feb-19 07:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
treasure rooms pop up more too

But I just started new game with hope to meet the dragon and can see only snakes and emus

[16-Feb-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL what gametxid and pubkey is crashing?

[16-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Seems it's only mine doing it

[16-Feb-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you just type cc/rogue/rogue

[16-Feb-19 07:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Watching now replay - it's crashing very early on lvl1 and it's like im using fresh warrior in this game but he wasn't fresh - I'm reused him in this game

did you go into options menu?

[16-Feb-19 07:45 PM] TonyL#3577
I don't think so

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Also now I'm scanning warriors on chain - there are a lot of Leroy Jenkins

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] TonyL#3577
But I've created only one

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a lvl5 lvl6 lvl7

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you probably didnt just go around inside one room

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] TonyL#3577
And all have different tokenids

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow the playerdata is not being used. investigating

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
I added pubkey arg to extract

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
My game stopped being crazy üò¶

[16-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so now you can extract the keystrokes for a pubkey that played a seed

it got the playerdata. it is infinite looping which is bad, you shouldnt be able to make it do that

Oh now I can investigate what happened in game where I lost my best warrior

[16-Feb-19 07:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Other one

[16-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you did a Q in that game? the replay shows you stuck in the first room

[16-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
something is very wrong with the replay

[16-Feb-19 07:54 PM] TonyL#3577

[16-Feb-19 07:55 PM] TonyL#3577
When I've started this dungeon

[16-Feb-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 2 scrolls of identify ring, wand or staff
created some confusion.

[16-Feb-19 07:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I died, then did 2 and it says I have 0 warriors

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
did 2 what?

[16-Feb-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if you die, warrier is dead

Oh, so you have to save to keep your warrior? I saw people talking about quiting and bailout and didnt understand what that meant

Actually it was quite strong warrior, not lvl1 and he not died - I quit on 9hp

[16-Feb-19 08:02 PM] TonyL#3577
And I've reused him as well - seems there is some issue when you reuse warrior in other game

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Dang, wish I understood better I had all kinds of things from that glitching.  Does the gold save or convert to ROGUE ?

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! maybe that is the issue. the first use is ok,, but after that it gets confused?

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if you die, you die. cant take it with you

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to quit before you die, then issue a bailout tx

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so how do you save?

[16-Feb-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you should read rogue.doc?

[16-Feb-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I've quit before I died

[16-Feb-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
And there is no death on replay

[16-Feb-19 08:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
S doesnt work for me for saving it does work for searching

[16-Feb-19 08:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
if it saved, i would have like 200 saved games.

[16-Feb-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
s is not S
