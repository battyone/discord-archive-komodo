But if keystroke with "failed" status in log and not generated transaction - after I quit rogue how it'll be broadcasted

[01-Mar-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
tui

[01-Mar-19 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha

[01-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when i put in logic to wait for confirmation, people complained about locked up system

[01-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so on exit, i now exit

[01-Mar-19 04:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll parse keystrokes.log I think to know the status

[01-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but that means that there could be 2 keystrokes tx in the mempool

[01-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
1 that was there the moment of game end and another that is the last keystrokes

[01-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i think a good thing would be to do an extract, it prints the gold, etc

[01-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is sane, then do a bailout

[01-Mar-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, then dont. once you do a bailout, whatever happens is permanent

[01-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the utxo from the newgame tx is being spent and that is a onetime thing

[01-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i think extract as a sanity test is good. you can also see if there are 1 or 2 keystrokes tx in the mempool

[01-Mar-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and user can confirm the gold amounts extracted before issuing bailout

[01-Mar-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this way, we can at least troubleshoot any games that have a bad extraction, while they are still in that state. once it is bailed out, there isnt much i can do, nor can i find out what state it was in

[01-Mar-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
extract should be able to extract the full gameplay even if it is in the mempool, but that needs to be tested

[01-Mar-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I need to know two things as I see;
1) txids of keystrokes which were broadcasted - to wait until they mined
2) explore if there any error = not broadcasted keystroke, ensure that it broadcasted and mined before bailout

[01-Mar-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
keystrokes.log should have all that

[01-Mar-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, so I'll just parse keystrokes.log

[01-Mar-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and get confirmation of bailout with extract command result

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
that way I can always fix whatever bug and rescue an otherwise would be deleted playerdata

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Extract working before bailout as well?

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it doing first

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Then baillout

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it should, needs testing

[01-Mar-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I see

[01-Mar-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, extract to make sure it will be a happy result, then and only then bailout. that alone might solve the main issue of tears for lost playerdata

[01-Mar-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then as all the various edge cases are fixed, all the extract will return the happy data for safe bailout. extract is essentially a trial run for a bailout, without doing the actual bailout

[01-Mar-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
only if there is any issue, would tui need to parse keystrokes to reconstruct what needs to be done

[01-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be that all keystrokes need to be confirmed before a proper extract

[01-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure

[01-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so, there seems to be a lot of questions that can be answered with a few changes to tui

{Reactions}
💯 

[01-Mar-19 04:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll look for `"status":"error"` in keystrokes.log but only when player stopped game - to not corrupt keystrokes consistency

[01-Mar-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[01-Mar-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
that and extract before bailout with user confirm of results

[01-Mar-19 05:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Great! Now it's clear what to do and why

[01-Mar-19 05:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Will start tomorrow from it

[01-Mar-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Now head not working good already - typing `keystokes` instead of `keystrokes` lol

[01-Mar-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
So written code will be buggy 100% 😂

[01-Mar-19 05:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Dear ROGUERs - if you don't want to lose progress - it's better to not play now. I'll try to implement data saving ensuring on TUI side tomorrow.

[01-Mar-19 05:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL  So testing play bounty, lets say March 4th -7th ?

[01-Mar-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's not set deadlines

[01-Mar-19 05:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm still on the same version as of 2 days ago, everything works fine except that all warriors save

[01-Mar-19 05:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sure

[01-Mar-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
If it will work fine tomorrow we'll make it after tomorrow. If not - there will be no sense until it fixed

[01-Mar-19 05:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
will switch to "Upcoming Play testing bounty: Stay tuned"

[01-Mar-19 05:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
And add the instructions and info to view. Its a lot so having a head start on what to doc is good.

[01-Mar-19 05:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill delete all of the other posts I made as well.

[01-Mar-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
You can just write that critical bugs were found

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And first round of campaign is finished

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Do you want me to keep documenting every time i play?

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think I have like... 12 games to submit

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw ronyi earned reward because sent correct report

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
yay ronyi!

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Only winner again! 😃

[01-Mar-19 05:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Pinned a message.

[01-Mar-19 05:09 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill submit mine when I get a chance. I had some trouble understanding where to see if gold --> ROGUE properly

[01-Mar-19 05:10 PM] ronyi#5719
? 😄 I'm just playing.

[01-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
There was a bounty for filling out the form. 😉  Thank you for all of your help !!!

[01-Mar-19 05:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Glad you have an awesome perspective about it

[01-Mar-19 05:11 PM] ronyi#5719
Now everything works well on my side, intresting. Last 8 play without any issue.

yassinheart 

[01-Mar-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
For me it happening in ~20% of such short games. So maybe you just was unlucky at first. Anyway hope TUI fix will help

[01-Mar-19 06:00 PM] ronyi#5719
hypothermia(secound time), kill "1 hit" and warrior is alive.

[01-Mar-19 10:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Finished my update, going to look it over a couple more times before sharing it. I'l be back here asap, going to try and rest up and beat being sick. 😃  See you all soon.

[02-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Have some progress 😃 Only left to detect errors in keystrokes and re-broadcast

[02-Mar-19 07:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Will assume that each second element I get from keystrokes.log for game is JSON response and left only it (params persists in JSON so I no need this list with call args)

[02-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
A little inconsistency persists in JSONs:
When transaction broadcasting fine its:
```"result":"success"},"error":null,"id":"jl777"}```
In case of error:
```"status":"error","error":"couldnt find batontxid"},"error":null,"id":"jl777"}```

[02-Mar-19 07:08 AM] TonyL#3577
So in case of success I need to expect "result" key, in case of error "status" key

[02-Mar-19 07:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, not sure what can I do in case when no keystrokes at all for game in keystrokes.log:
```Top Ten Scores:
   Score Name
 1    79 : quit on level 1.
39574
39574
Waiting for next block before bailout

Keystrokes of this game:


Extraction info:

{'name': 'rogue', 'method': 'extract', 'gametxid': 'ee487efdb37d4df59b680f5f3fbfe93b7da8bc49e3b954f3b463f379b3680e96', 'rogueaddr': 'RVuzXY65FyJiPPWSBc9efATh6nb4M9MceR', 'status': 'error'}
```

[02-Mar-19 07:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, it was added with some delay

[02-Mar-19 07:23 AM] TonyL#3577
To file

[02-Mar-19 07:23 AM] TonyL#3577
So just have to scan file more until find something 😃

[02-Mar-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i can add local file logging for keystrokes if needed.

[02-Mar-19 07:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm parsing keystrokes.log

[02-Mar-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that should work as good as it would be the same functions making the local log. ok, so it seems  we are maybe going to have a new level of reliability. instead of relying on luck for bailing out with the right warrior we can verify ahead of time. and even take corrective actions. what would be left are edge case bugs where the bug is reproduced with somehow an extract that isnt working properly

{Reactions}
🚀 

[02-Mar-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, if progress not satisfy user - he can press button now and wait 10 seconds more, if no keystrokes found in log at all - it waiting until there will be some attempts, if keystroke broadcasted with error - it should rebroadcast it until get txid

[02-Mar-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Should me much better after polish it

[02-Mar-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Ohhh wrote Windows incompatible parser - just realised :/

[02-Mar-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
```def find_game_keystrokes_in_log(gametxid):

    p1 = subprocess.Popen(["cat", "keystrokes.log"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    p2 = subprocess.Popen(["grep", gametxid], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    p1.stdout.close()
    output = p2.communicate()[0]
    keystrokes_log_for_game = bytes.decode(output).split("\n")
    return keystrokes_log_for_game```

[02-Mar-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Unlikely Windows have `cat` and `grep`

[02-Mar-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I can change the format of keystrokes.log if needed to make it work on windows

[02-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577
In general it will be just a sweet dream if for each game will be creating `gametxid.keystrokes.log`

[02-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577
In `logs` folder let's say

[02-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
So even if player will play gazillions of games files will be tiny

[02-Mar-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i used to have it doing that, just not in a folder

[02-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh folder just for user-friendliness

[02-Mar-19 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Can be without folder if needed

[02-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will reenable that

[02-Mar-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Yay

[02-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
That was great idea @jl777c ! Seems it might help

[02-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Just want to catch "baton not found case" now

[02-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
does the extraction data show the amount of hold, hp, strength...

[02-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes - as value of "extracted" key

[02-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the user sees that then if gold matches what they had, it should be the same player

[02-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, just user have to remember how many he had

[02-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that stores the raw keystrokes in seed.1, seed.2, ... files

[02-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
seed.0 file is created by extract

[02-Mar-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so this way both can coexist. the first seed.N file that is 0 length indicates the prior one was the last

[02-Mar-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577
keystrokes.log remained as well?
