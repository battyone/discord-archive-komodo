And from this level progress stops to record - it looks not like non-det but some keystrokes ordering/broadcasting clue

Maybe counted by some not super cool level, or gold from item conversion not accumulated

I very happy, game extracted "fine" and warrior is alive with all stuff. I created gameplay video 1h:23min ðŸ˜„ I think missing  ROGUE and based on  inscripton, the warrior should have disappeared.

You have same prints and dl16 extracted only

[24-Mar-19 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
But with amulet already so you got this "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find" on the way back

[24-Mar-19 10:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So for now it seems biggest issue. But problem is that keystroke not broadcasting sometimes, not non det I think. Will make a script now to analyze keystoekes.log and find out are all txs on blockchain or not. Also in debug.log I have prints about negative vout - so it should be related

Ok so for my game as I expected from some point keystrokes stopped to broadcast on chain (on the moment when I got "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find" print I wonder). I made a code to just check if keystrokes for game from keystrokes.log are on chain :

```Keystroke not broadcasted: 97b3e48c4883d6b281ed8f22984112e2027ded81e67293d66a18ba45641ad1f9

@jl777c So issue is super clear now. By some reason some keystrokes generating with negative vout0 and game progress not saving after this point obv.

Call and output hex which generated keystroke with negative vout0:

it seems unexpectedly many keystrokes, will need to adjust the amount spent for baton.

[24-Mar-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed version with 10x smaller keystrokes, which means baton can do 10x more keystrokes tx before going negative

[24-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
If I understand correct - only daemon update is needed?

[24-Mar-19 01:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Will test and refresh bundles if it fine

[24-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe it will complain with every keystrokes tx, but it should work. if the txfee is 1000 sats for keystrokes tx, then it is working

[24-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the baton only supported 100 keystrokes tx files

[24-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems in some cases that was exceeded

each keystrokes tx uses a txfee and sends the rest to vout0

[24-Mar-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
starts with 0.01 coins

[24-Mar-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you see a keystrokes tx error, it seems just coincidence

[24-Mar-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
I see same print  "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find 00000..."

[24-Mar-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
And have same negative vout0

Built daemon from this commit

[24-Mar-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm you've changed txfee from 10000 to 1000 so this vout should be -1000 sat, not -10000 i wonder

[24-Mar-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the keystrokes tx before that one?

[24-Mar-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh this one is also negative

[24-Mar-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me find last transaction with non negative vout for this game

[24-Mar-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577
So last good keystroke for this game: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9qWt6hJ4dg/

[24-Mar-19 06:15 PM] TonyL#3577

        ]
      }```

[24-Mar-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Then two with negative vout (I've posted above)

[24-Mar-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
By logic which you've described - it have "value": 0.00840000 left, so the next one (https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/qhXTM5zKkr/) spend funds somehow incorrect I wonder

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
then the bug is caused by something else

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
was it 0.0085 before that one?

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
seems the txfee change didnt take effect

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me check

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] TonyL#3577
```  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.00850000,

        ]
      }
    },
```

[24-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think not being able to find the baton makes it a fatal issue and it gets value of 0 and subtracts txfee from it

[24-Mar-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the txfee in latest should be 1000 sats

[24-Mar-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i need to force it to be 1000 sats

[24-Mar-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
fixing

[24-Mar-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
updated

[24-Mar-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
But anyway - even it's 10000 why it's -10000 after 840000 ?

[24-Mar-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
still this doesnt explain that

[24-Mar-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, this `if txfee == 0 => txfee = 1000` looked suspicious for me ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Mar-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
But I dont know much about underlaying code

[24-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
cant finalize means it couldnt find the prior vin for some reasopn

[24-Mar-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
I think its print on next keystroke broadcast

[24-Mar-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
When previous have negative vout and not broadcasted

[24-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
can you make it consistently get the negative vout?

[24-Mar-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
No it happens randomly

[24-Mar-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
But then if you continue playing after one print

[24-Mar-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
On next levels I have same print
