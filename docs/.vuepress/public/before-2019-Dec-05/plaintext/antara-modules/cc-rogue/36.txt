`replay finished but readchar called` maybe this print on bailout broadcast affected somehow

As an idea maybe it's because player was not compatible with latest updates. But too upset now to try go lvl15 again today üòÉ

about tokens issue: I can see vout order is reversed in rogue_finishgame:
the first is marker, then amount
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(EVAL_TOKENS, txfee, GetUnspendable(cpTokens,NULL)));            
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeTokensCC1vout(cp->evalcode,1,mypk));
I expected the backward order

[17-Feb-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL the replay still goes, what level did you get to? I think I can salvage Leeroy

[17-Feb-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
15 level

[17-Feb-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
He is fine, just progress not saved

[17-Feb-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why it would have stopped the replay so early

[17-Feb-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
could be bug in cursesd, I also found if you took more than an hour to do 4096 keystrokes, it would stop there, but the playback would also be stopped

[17-Feb-19 05:09 PM] TonyL#3577
4096 per hour means 68,26 per minute üòØ

[17-Feb-19 05:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Same situation happened today earlier before I pulled todays updates

[17-Feb-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i removed that, so now it is one hour for a level

```replay finished but readchar called

yes, extract does what daemon does. the dapp is replaying properly, so there is a bug i replay

[17-Feb-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810

@TonyL pushed fix to jl777 branch. make sure to make clean in rogue dir and build all rogue files

[17-Feb-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also a likely bug if using a playerdata that was via tokentransfer. dont do it with Leeroy!

[17-Feb-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there was no non-determinism bug, so that is good news

Trying to optimise warriors scanner - can't understand one moment:

If I do one RPC call per token from tokenlist (just call for each token `cclib playerinfo`) scanning taking 0.11 seconds
When I'm adding second call to check `tokenbalance deadpubkey`  process taking 20 seconds

[17-Feb-19 05:44 PM] TonyL#3577
x2 RPC calls = x200 execution time ü§ï

[17-Feb-19 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
```def warriors_scanner(rpc_connection):
    start_time = time.time()
    token_list = rpc_connection.tokenlist()
    my_warriors_list = rogue_players_list(rpc_connection)
    warriors_list = {}
    for token in token_list:
        player_info = rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, token)
        if "status" in player_info and player_info["status"] == "error":
            pass
        else:
            if player_info["player"]["tokenid"] in my_warriors_list["playerdata"]:
                pass
            elif rpc_connection.tokenbalance(player_info["player"]["tokenid"], "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead")["balance"] == 1:
                pass
            else:
                warriors_list[token] = player_info["player"]
    print("--- %s seconds ---" % (time.time() - start_time))
    return warriors_list
```

[17-Feb-19 05:46 PM] TonyL#3577
If not check ```           elif rpc_connection.tokenbalance(player_info["player"]["tokenid"], "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead")["balance"] == 1:
                pass``` it's 200 times faster üòÉ

[17-Feb-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
do you do them in alternating order?

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
or all playerinfo calls, followed by check dead calls

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] TonyL#3577
If I'm getting "error" from playerinfo I'm not doing anything else with this token from list anymore

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] TonyL#3577
And proceed to the next

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] TonyL#3577
If playerinfo return not error I'm checking tokenbalance on deadpubkey

[17-Feb-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be that you run out of memory, so try to do all playerinfo, then issue the dead check all at once

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so skip the dead check on the first pass

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
that finishes in 0.11 seconds

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so then it becomes how long does all the dead checks take

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
performance issues often dont fit the normal logics

[17-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all about fitting in to available RAM, or L1 cache

[17-Feb-19 05:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Will try to separate this way, thanks for advice!

[17-Feb-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
in general if you do X that takes n seconds and Y that does m seconds, it should both take n+m

[17-Feb-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you change it so you are doing a bunch of xy things, even though total done is identical, the timing is entirely different

[17-Feb-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
like making a sandwich and delivering it to someone across town, and repeating it 200 times

{Reactions}
üòÉ 

[17-Feb-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
vs. making 200 sandwiches and delivering them one by one, but only across the city and back

[17-Feb-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
can be indeed 100x faster

[17-Feb-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
you would never think to make a sandwich, deliver cross town, come back and repeat

[17-Feb-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
as the whole delivery time is very noticeable

[17-Feb-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
when issue DB calls, if it incurs a HDD seek... that is milliseconds (cross town)

[17-Feb-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and HDD are smart enough to do things out of request order in optimal ways, of course SSD will reduce this effect, but still SSD is orders of magnitude slower than RAM

[17-Feb-19 05:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Have sense, nice example with sandwich üòÉ

[17-Feb-19 05:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Python interpreter may also decide that you need barbecue instead of sandwich - faced it when played with python threading

[17-Feb-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, there is a "smart" layer in between. then anything can happen

[17-Feb-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the only thing that you would know for sure are specific performance results with specific data sets on specific hardware

[17-Feb-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok made test, now I know what is the reason.
```rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, "babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c")
--- 0.004049777984619141 seconds ---```
```token_balance(rpc_connection, "babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c", "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead")
--- 0.25556230545043945 seconds ---```

[17-Feb-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
For single `playerinfo` call I'm getting response *much* faster than for single `tokenbalance` call

[17-Feb-19 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So during the apps architecting it's better to not use `tokenCC` calls in loops I think (or in this particular case with balance for pubkey getting)

[17-Feb-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenbalance for dead address will continue to get slower

[17-Feb-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be a lot faster if you just looked up the txid and see if its destination is the dead address

[17-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c  can the tokens store data for different games? 
So you could have your Rogue Warriors 
Then if another game is implemented on the same chain, say Stone Soup, could you have separate tokens for that as well?  If so do you think it would be super difficult to do so for some reason? 
I am trying to figure out what is possible on one chain and what is not.

[17-Feb-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
playerdata is just a token with supply of 1

[17-Feb-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there can be arbitrary number of games that issue tokens

[17-Feb-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is probably best to keep most of them on their own chain for scalability

[17-Feb-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on crosschain transfers of the tokens

[17-Feb-19 06:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That was my next question!

[17-Feb-19 06:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I assumed multiple games on ONE chain would make the change HUGE and quickly.
