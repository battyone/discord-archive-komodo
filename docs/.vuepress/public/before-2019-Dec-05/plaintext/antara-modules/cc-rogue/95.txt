If re-useing warrior and quit without gold= kill

[18-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Quit without gold = kill in any case

[18-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha in game above:
in `.2` keystroke:
```kkfjlhhhjjjjjjjjlllllllllllllljjjlllllllllll fllllllllllllllljr* e w rw

[18-Mar-19 09:41 AM] TonyL#3577
One `h` after `>` - I think I saw it before when checked keystrokes of games with lost progress. Anyway it looks like a bug because it's not possible to move on level when you used stairs

[18-Mar-19 10:32 AM] ronyi#5719

Is it same when you dying to hobgoblin let's say?

[18-Mar-19 10:33 AM] ronyi#5719
Another hypotheria killed, but warrior is alive.

[18-Mar-19 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Same last frame "You are frozen by ice monster"

[18-Mar-19 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
So something not correct happens in "You are frozen by ice monster -> Death because of hyperthermia" case imo

[18-Mar-19 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
But anyway maybe it's even good?

[18-Mar-19 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Icemonster just sending you back to base instead of random warrior losing

[18-Mar-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
every call to the RNG will change the seed

[18-Mar-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
We can rename icemonster to "beatuful Lady" and  `died because of hyperthermia` to `decided to go walk with lady instead of dungeons grinding`

[18-Mar-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
😃

[18-Mar-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, it's sexist I wonder - why I'm assuming that warrior is a guy

[18-Mar-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
And homofob as well - maybe guy can meet guy or somebody else - bad idea this renaming

[18-Mar-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/tag/0.3.1

Updated Rogue bundle.

```Changes since 0.3.0:

    Fixes in ROGUE RPC:
    fix for small gold reward (<10000 sat) games
    fix negative vout3 (change calc fixes?)

    TUI waiting for bailout to be mined now (should help to track when bailout not broadcasting by some reason + clearing process with warrior appearing in playerslist)
```

Opened problems remained: 
1) part of progress missing in some cases - have not many ideas so far. I wonder have to change io.c to get more info into the log.
2) ice monster not killing warriors - might be related to 1 

@wookie When you'll be with PC/have a chance - please try to bailout from your game with negative vout  about which you've reported with fresh OSX bundle  ( ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%220669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a%22]")

Hmmm but you never had `exp.545`

[18-Mar-19 12:56 PM] TonyL#3577
You had `exp.536` max with 246 gold

[18-Mar-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
And never had exactly 545 experience at all in this game

[18-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
So by some reason in extract of game with corrupted progress printing  some not correct experience which is never existed in actual game

[18-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Is it ^^ giving some clue to problem code paths?

[18-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder extract/replays corrupting might be because of not correct/not matching experience counting on some point

[18-Mar-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Sounds realistic

[18-Mar-19 01:01 PM] ronyi#5719
I playing more longer games ~lvl10 and creating gameplay videos, i hope somehow help.

[18-Mar-19 01:02 PM] TonyL#3577

what did it say it would save before you bailed out?

[18-Mar-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
are all games failing for you now? seems you found a pattern to cause it to miss data

[18-Mar-19 04:45 PM] ronyi#5719
No, i played game this warrior before this game and everything was good, but this game is total lost.

[18-Mar-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what did it display that it would save, before you saved it

[18-Mar-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, there is a moment when he defeated icemonster on lvl1

[18-Mar-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Before he defeated him he had 703 experience

[18-Mar-19 04:52 PM] TonyL#3577
After defeated 708 experience

[18-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
level 1 instead of 14 is like it didnt go down the stairs on level 1 and somehow didnt get killed with thousands of random keystrokes

what does replay end up with

[18-Mar-19 05:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Replay is super strange - like a he running in same room for  a long time (level is same as in youtube video but he is doing other things)

[18-Mar-19 05:10 PM] TonyL#3577
In log all 6333 keystrokes:
```6331: (Q) hp.49 num.20 gold.122 seed.9650372919824450667
6332: (W) hp.49 num.20 gold.122 seed.9650372919824450667
6333: (y) hp.49 num.20 gold.122 seed.9650372919824450667
```

[18-Mar-19 05:10 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's like a whole action is on dl1

[18-Mar-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow the exit was in the wrong spot, he missed it in the replay, which would lead to drunken behavior

[18-Mar-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
```432: (h) hp.49 num.22 gold.94 seed.17239303462779000152

434: (h) hp.49 num.22 gold.122 seed.6561757463836692087
``` 
Something happened here and after it  `hp.49 num.22 gold.122` is the same for all other keystrokes

[18-Mar-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder this something is exit usage

[18-Mar-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
How to print in log which action happening on each keystroke and all rogue prints?

[18-Mar-19 05:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Only thing @ronyi did with 94 gold is pick up armor to inventory / drop armor from inventory

[18-Mar-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I need 122 sorry

[18-Mar-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
some non-det issue at around 433

[18-Mar-19 05:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha with 122 gold there is a fight with `kestrel`

[18-Mar-19 05:17 PM] TonyL#3577
In previous game with lost progress there was fight with `kestrel` too before things went wrong

[18-Mar-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically I will need to dig into this as they require understanding what exactly happened in the code. in commands.c you can log the characters. kestrel is just a common early level monster, probably coincidence

[18-Mar-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Before use stairs he picked up gold and balance became 149

[18-Mar-19 05:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, kestrel not connected definetly

And in previous game with missed progress you reported:
```hhl>h``` on level after which progress missed

[18-Mar-19 05:20 PM] TonyL#3577
So it's not so non-det now I wonder

[18-Mar-19 05:23 PM] TonyL#3577
At least now it's clear (I hope) that progress is missing when in keystrokes for level presists some symbols after `>`

[18-Mar-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
