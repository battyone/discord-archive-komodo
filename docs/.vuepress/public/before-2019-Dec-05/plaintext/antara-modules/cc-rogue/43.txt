So now I have to throw items before bailout to fit my current strength?

I've created brand new warrior - started new game, collected 38 items, snake hurt me and my strength became 11

[18-Feb-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
I've quit dungeon and on next enter have 32 items

[18-Feb-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[18-Feb-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810

i could just go back to 23 pack entries

[18-Feb-19 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought it'll work a little bit different way - like a if you have strength 11 you can't pickup until your total items amount is less than 33

[18-Feb-19 04:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Not randomly losing items

[18-Feb-19 05:01 PM] TonyL#3577
In case of random items loosing there should be some asking of player which items he want to left on exit to fit strength. But it's really overcomplicating - maybe it's really better to return to 23 slots model on this point

[18-Feb-19 05:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Since there is even no counter in inventory and no any notification about allowed amount - player may be very confused

[18-Feb-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i added a printout when you do inventory

Print in inventory works only when you call inventory first time

On second inventory call it's not showing

I've tried to drop item, use arrows - it's not prints after first call

[18-Feb-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the curses is smart and it doesnt update screen if nothing has changed, but I bypass some part of it to get the totals print in there. at least it is there some of the time

at least no game crashes, so it is just violating the 3x strength rule?

[18-Feb-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems so, will try to register this warrior to the next game - will see what happens

[18-Feb-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it's just edge case with arrows

[18-Feb-19 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Because as soon as I get print `strength*3 48 vs total.61 vs 12 inventory le` I wasn't able to pickup more with "no space in room" print

[18-Feb-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
like arrows are sometimes just 1

[18-Feb-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, arrows, daggers, darts

[18-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe when you throw the first one, it counts them separately

[18-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
like its in a one box, but to use it you open it and all are counted

[18-Feb-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see any logic like that in the code, but not 100% up to speed with it yet

[18-Feb-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
got about one third validating from beginning, seems over half of recent ones

[18-Feb-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
In original rogue box with arrows counted as one item

[18-Feb-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
But as soon as you throw arrow, it miss, and you picking it up - this single arrow counting as separate from pack item and taking separate letter in menu

[18-Feb-19 06:22 PM] TonyL#3577

Have 43 not 48 but definetly better that instadead

[18-Feb-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so basically we went from losing Leeroy, to losing a few pack items if you are overfilled

[18-Feb-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
50% of very recent games validating, and the last 13 in a row

[18-Feb-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
since all these game changes changes the game, it would likely invalidate all the earlier games

[18-Feb-19 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Without suspicious items like arrows picking up ingame validation seems correct - only thing is that it printing "no more room in your pack" when you have 49 items and trying to pick up 50th

[18-Feb-19 06:42 PM] TonyL#3577
With different strength gaining/losing transfers between games with inventory of different sizes there are so many cases so more testers/testing needed

[18-Feb-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Loose scrolls is definitely better to lose whole warrior on which you've spent 1hour+ of gameplay

[18-Feb-19 06:46 PM] TonyL#3577
And 1000% better than  1hr+ of gameplay losing few times because accidentally pressed Q+n in game beginning

[18-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so we can keep the 3x strength as it is and see how it plays. with clear stats on where things are you can dump the useless items before bailing out
