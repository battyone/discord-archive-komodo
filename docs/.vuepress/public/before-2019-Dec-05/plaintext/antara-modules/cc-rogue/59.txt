@Cryptofist it's with Crypto Rich. If you want to join in you need to check with @ca333 as he's due to go on. Maybe you could join?

[21-Feb-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you must copy ROGUE.conf from ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf (or equivalent location) to current dir

[21-Feb-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that means: you must copy ROGUE.conf from ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf (or equivalent location) to current dir

@benohanlon  Up to them!  I can make sure @ca333  has my marketing plan before hand if I don't go on.  I now ca333 has the excitement and tech info covered. 😉

I understand this message, but ROGUE.conf in this location.

I have had to edit ROUGE to ROGUE at least 300 times.

[21-Feb-19 05:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
guess what was the first explorer subdomain:) not rogue

[21-Feb-19 05:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
hahahaha

[21-Feb-19 05:51 PM] nael55#5863
@Cryptofist issue seems to have corrected itself. just made a new singleplayer game

[21-Feb-19 05:51 PM] nael55#5863
not sure what happened

[21-Feb-19 05:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Awesome!!!!

[21-Feb-19 05:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Its a blockchain game under heavy development, there is tons of bugs fixed and probably twice as many not seen.  *Keep breaking it.*

[21-Feb-19 05:53 PM] nael55#5863
👍

[21-Feb-19 06:16 PM] ronyi#5719
ROGUE.conf this location: ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf, but same error: you must copy ROGUE.conf from ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf (or equivalent location) to current dir

[21-Feb-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
is ROGUE.conf in ~/komodo/src now?

[21-Feb-19 06:30 PM] ronyi#5719
I never copyed ROGUE.conf in ~/komodo/src/ my ROGUE.conf in default location i think.(~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf). But I copy now in ~/komodo/src/

[21-Feb-19 06:33 PM] ronyi#5719
Thx, it works like this.

[21-Feb-19 06:53 PM] ciumete#3212
on Manual -> Step 4 i receive next error

[21-Feb-19 06:53 PM] ciumete#3212
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "register",
  "status": "error",
  "error": "didnt register in time, ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP"
}

[21-Feb-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
60 blocks should be plenty of time to register

[21-Feb-19 06:54 PM] ciumete#3212
1 block=1 min ?

[21-Feb-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
approx

[21-Feb-19 06:56 PM] ciumete#3212
from step 1 to step 4 takes about 5 min max

[21-Feb-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
"error": "didnt register in time, ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP"
that means 60+ blocks happened from the newgame tx

[21-Feb-19 06:57 PM] ciumete#3212
i make steps 1 to 4 again...

[21-Feb-19 07:00 PM] ciumete#3212
stept 2 no need anymore i think

[21-Feb-19 07:00 PM] ciumete#3212
so same error

  "error": "didnt register in time, ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP"

[21-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
"gameheight": 0,
you need to be in sync

[21-Feb-19 07:03 PM] ciumete#3212
i see

[21-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if not in sync the game will be invalid. I think the TUI needs to make sure chain is in sync

[21-Feb-19 07:04 PM] ciumete#3212
ok so "gameheight" > 0  to work register

[21-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
not just >0, needs to be in sync with chain

[21-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Just finished an article, (I think). While building two others. 😃  
Break time.  Then ill go back, double check things and let you guys take a look.

[21-Feb-19 07:09 PM] wookie#7663
I'm on level 3 and there's no way out?  The dark rooms have no stairs and the side branches from the middle and lower rooms have blind ends. Should I report this? https://i.imgur.com/AZ3Z8da.png

you need to press `s` to search for doors

[21-Feb-19 07:09 PM] wookie#7663
oh, in the dark rooms?

[21-Feb-19 07:10 PM] wookie#7663
oh, thanks @SHossain , got it!

[21-Feb-19 07:15 PM] SHossain#0007
for these things (i.e.: strategy) google is your best friend

[21-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Anywhere near a wall where there seems to be space on a map

[21-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@wookie

[21-Feb-19 07:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I posted the two best guides here somewhere

[21-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Middle hallway that ends....

[21-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Go to the end hit s several times

[21-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Usually if there's a passage 1-5 times is enough

[21-Feb-19 07:19 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks!

[21-Feb-19 07:20 PM] t0sma#0368
how long it take to DL all blocks ?

[21-Feb-19 07:22 PM] SHossain#0007
10 minutes depending on your system spec and internet connection speed

[21-Feb-19 07:22 PM] t0sma#0368
thanks

[21-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill release a more condensed set of gameplay tips and tricks for getting started as soon as I can.  There is so much to know that the guides are overwhelming books. @wookie

Do I have to turn off my KMD wallet daemon to play?

[21-Feb-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD daemon doesn't cause any problem with ROGUE play

[21-Feb-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
all independent

[21-Feb-19 08:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I started the tui and it said no daemon.

[21-Feb-19 08:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Need to hit up the readme I guess 😛

[21-Feb-19 08:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
God Im so proactive and yet so lazy.  How is that possible?

[21-Feb-19 08:35 PM] nael55#5863
you are a super position

[21-Feb-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@FishyGuts which OS?

[21-Feb-19 08:37 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to run the ROGUE chain

[21-Feb-19 08:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hmmm K.  Will read the readme 😃

[21-Feb-19 09:05 PM] Strob#3417
Can we save the game, when I press S it says "Saving is disabled, use bailout rpc"

[21-Feb-19 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
press Q and don't bailout

[21-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Strob#3417
Ok it will just pause the game

[21-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Strob#3417
When I press 2, it always just says "You own 0 warriors" How can we gwet warriors?

[21-Feb-19 09:43 PM] mazyar_lp#3486

[21-Feb-19 09:44 PM] Strob#3417
When we try to use shift with the arrows instead of the hjkl keys,  instead of ru8nning it ask if I want to quit for the up arrow and if I want to wear something with the bottom arrow.
