just clone as normal yeah?

I'm sorry, tired. Going to rest üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 04:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's in master now

[12-Feb-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
i couldn't play today with TUI üò¶

[12-Feb-19 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure what is wrong

[12-Feb-19 04:30 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah thanks for help Tony enjoy rest

[12-Feb-19 04:31 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Did you try to recompile and restart everything?

[12-Feb-19 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
trying manual now

[12-Feb-19 04:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive had to wipe and start again a few times today

[12-Feb-19 04:31 PM] TonyL#3577
If daemon hangs in TUI it probably will hang in non TUI mode since TUI just issuing RPC calls

[12-Feb-19 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
will wipe and start again if manual play has issues

[12-Feb-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
`A` dudes on 9 lvl broke all armor lol

[12-Feb-19 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
manual play is working

[12-Feb-19 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
somehow my TUI is sending daemon to infinite loop?

[12-Feb-19 04:35 PM] TonyL#3577
When you starting new game TUI not interacting with daemon at all after register transaction is mined ü§î

[12-Feb-19 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
cloned new TUI from source and trying again

[12-Feb-19 04:36 PM] TonyL#3577
It's just starting rogue executable and everything else doing rogue executable until game is ended

[12-Feb-19 04:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Just as an idea - maybe TUI files in folder with other daemon

[12-Feb-19 04:37 PM] SHossain#0007
it's at the same folder

New TUI "waiting for next block" üëç

[12-Feb-19 04:41 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Aha, it hanged on `gameinfo 17 c22cf9d7bc9c431e309179a3e34af0bb5e1b319e72fdbdf6c947ca6987659064` call

[12-Feb-19 04:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Hmm timed out. waiting for block 14290 but exploerer was 14291 then 14292 came TUI hang

[12-Feb-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
finally! i'm not insane :troll:

[12-Feb-19 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
On your side I mean - not sure why üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Or on `players 17` call

[12-Feb-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@CryptoNinjaa seems to have the same issue as well ^^

[12-Feb-19 04:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it didnt see 2 new blocks

[12-Feb-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm running the TUI executable file from inside `~/komodo/src/` dir and the daemon works fine when i use manually

[12-Feb-19 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe something changed since last night

[12-Feb-19 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
it was working fine for me

[12-Feb-19 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
it was also number 2 which had the single player game. today moved to 3

[12-Feb-19 04:46 PM] TonyL#3577
When playing manually can you issue `bailout` for your game after game is finished and then try to call `gameinfo` for same game and `players 17` before `bailout` is mined?

[12-Feb-19 04:46 PM] TonyL#3577
This way we detect on which RPC call daemon deadlock. I hope

[12-Feb-19 04:49 PM] TonyL#3577
What TUI calling:
1) "newgame", "17", "[1]" - to start new game
Waiting for this transaction to be mined
2)  "players", "17" - to check if player have any warriors to choose
3) In case if there no any players it calling "register", "17", gametxid
In case if there is any player it asks for player txid then calling  "register", "17", gametxid + playertxid

[12-Feb-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
4) After it TUI calling "gameinfo", "17", gametxid to get the seed
5) subprocess.call(["cc/rogue/rogue", str(game_info["seed"]), str(game_info["gametxid"])]) - game executing and all business on rogue executable side

[12-Feb-19 04:52 PM] TonyL#3577
After game is finished (first Enter press) - it sending ``` "bailout", "17", gametxid``` (now there is testing version which waiting for a one block before bailout and waiting for bailout transaction to be mined)

[12-Feb-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
[2] moved to [3] because I've added new menu item to get  "players", "17" list of players
TUI doing sequence of RPC calls - if daemon hangs when you using TUI it's possible to reproduce by manual same RPC calls issuing
As I understand now there are some cases when daemon hangs on `players` and `bailout` calls

[12-Feb-19 04:56 PM] SHossain#0007
new game doesn't do bailout until played, right?

[12-Feb-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup bailout doing after game is finished

[12-Feb-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
New call which in TUI logic before game start is `players 17`

[12-Feb-19 05:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Is `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17` working fine manually on your side @SHossain ?

[12-Feb-19 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
just a sec. let me restart the daemon

[12-Feb-19 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
this is the call sending daemon to infinite loop

[12-Feb-19 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
happened just after fresh start

[12-Feb-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
As a suggestion maybe there were hardforking changes after your yesterday trades with James

[12-Feb-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
So personally yours players list is corrupted at the moment

[12-Feb-19 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, James did a lot of rework since then

[12-Feb-19 05:07 PM] TonyL#3577
With fresh wallet it should work fine I think

[12-Feb-19 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me clone totally fresh

[12-Feb-19 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
started fresh compilation

[12-Feb-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
You may just use fresh wallet.dat

[12-Feb-19 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. will do. also will sync from fresh

Happy gaming!

If you have time - try to play some fast, some a longer games, some with death some with player saving  and some with player reusing from your saved players list

Daemon hanged on your side on `bailout 17 gametxid` call

[12-Feb-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
need to go slow

[12-Feb-19 05:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm waited for a next block before issue bailout not sure what I else can do from TUI side @jl777c

[12-Feb-19 05:33 PM] SHossain#0007
give an option for manual `bailout` rather than automatic

[12-Feb-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
if the previous txs (i.e.: keystrokes) are not confirmed, using bailout will send the daemon to infinite loop for now

[12-Feb-19 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI waited for one block after game is finished before execute `bailout`

[12-Feb-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I need to reliably duplicate the hang and fix it. or maybe I can just put limits in all possible places that can infinite loop first and that will help narrow down the problem and avoid forcing a daemon restart

[12-Feb-19 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
limiting all possible places sounds a good idea to narrow it down

[12-Feb-19 05:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Can't not only hang it reliable way but even hang it at all now so limits sounds good üòÉ

Probably if you execute bailout now again it daemon hangs again

Made hang on bailout on my side as well

[12-Feb-19 05:59 PM] TonyL#3577
What I did - run quite fast to lvl3 and quit game staying on lvl3 stairs

[12-Feb-19 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So early game quit and bailout then seems reliable way to reproduce üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 06:00 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, on different level, currently we need to wait for the previous keystrokes tx to be confirmed

[12-Feb-19 06:01 PM] SHossain#0007
as far as i remember, James made it not to have keystrokes tx on every level

[12-Feb-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe clue is to not quit lvl X when Z blocks not passed since level Y

[12-Feb-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Something like this

[12-Feb-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you do early quit and immediate bailout it hangs most the time?

[12-Feb-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Not even immideatly - TUI waiting for one block  now before `bailout`

[12-Feb-19 06:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Waiting for one block before bailout in any case (death or quit)

[12-Feb-19 06:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Just bailout after early quit hangs most the time

[12-Feb-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
is there anything in mempool at the time?
