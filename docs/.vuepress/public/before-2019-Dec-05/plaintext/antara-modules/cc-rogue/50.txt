@SHossain ``xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates``

[19-Feb-19 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
`brew update`

[19-Feb-19 06:23 PM] Meyse#0952
``Already up-to-date.``

[19-Feb-19 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
`brew upgrade`

[19-Feb-19 06:44 PM] Meyse#0952
same thing with xcode again

[19-Feb-19 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have xcode installed, that is good. did `brew upgrade` do anything?

[19-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Meyse#0952
yes it did

[19-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Meyse#0952
installed update

[19-Feb-19 06:47 PM] Meyse#0952
i just installed macos update too

[19-Feb-19 06:47 PM] SHossain#0007
did you use these?
```
brew tap discoteq/discoteq; brew install flock
brew install autoconf autogen automake
brew install gcc@6
brew install binutils
brew install protobuf
brew install coreutils
brew install wget
```

[19-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Meyse#0952

if you have any package that needs to be updated, use `reinstall` i.e.: `brew reinstall gcc@6`

[19-Feb-19 07:11 PM] Meyse#0952
got new errors üòÑ last thing before compiling stopped

[19-Feb-19 07:11 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont think it makes sense to continue if ca said there are deps missing

[19-Feb-19 07:12 PM] ca333#0118
@Meyse - current instruction should be ok. Can you please make a gist.github.com or pastebin.com of your error output

[19-Feb-19 07:12 PM] ca333#0118
the relevant output starts with `error:`

[19-Feb-19 07:12 PM] ca333#0118
the above warning is "harmless"

[19-Feb-19 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
@Meyse i would also recommend to use fresh clone.

[19-Feb-19 07:14 PM] Meyse#0952
errors everywhere, im just gonna start again

[19-Feb-19 07:18 PM] ca333#0118
ok start it again and if it fails copy/paste like 150 - 200 lines above the:
```
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
```

[19-Feb-19 07:18 PM] ca333#0118
into a gist. or pastebin

hm

[19-Feb-19 07:35 PM] ca333#0118
Have you tried reinstalling ?
Which OSX version are you running? And can you please check `gcc-6 --version` it seems outdated too. brew update and upgrade is a good idea in this case.

[19-Feb-19 07:37 PM] dude#6062
@jl777c  thanks for update... was going nuts trying to figure out why it wouldn't compile! its working now

[19-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Meyse#0952
@ca333 macos mojave 10.14.3, all deps are up to date, did all the steps 3 times now

[19-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Meyse#0952
ill try reinstalling all deps

[19-Feb-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm also using 10.14.3 Mojave and works fine on my end

I updated 5 hours ago

[19-Feb-19 08:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think that time is right

[19-Feb-19 08:35 PM] SHossain#0007

You not input anything to asktxid field

[19-Feb-19 08:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok thats all of my bugs for now

[19-Feb-19 08:36 PM] TonyL#3577
So TUI crashed because it handle not correct input on this place because of not correct handling

[19-Feb-19 08:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So, i copied and pasted a txid several times and it always did that

Did you catch everything else I posted? I can condense it all later if you want tony.

[19-Feb-19 08:37 PM] dude#6062
mmm, said i had 216 gold in game... but when i died said 195?

[19-Feb-19 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist There might be definitely something broken in DEX features  in todays TUI updates (I've reworked scanners a little and didn't re-check DEX) - ``` Check if somebody selling warrior``` seems to not work very correct atm (asks scanner not printing asks with warriors)

[19-Feb-19 08:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
All good my man, just want to make sure I report everything I see to ya.

[19-Feb-19 08:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
No inconvience to me. lol

[19-Feb-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for report! Is it crashing as well when you input correct ask txid instead of blank input?

[19-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
OH ok so for that

[19-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it just reverted back to the E or R

[19-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Only crashed on no input and enter

[19-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So I would paste a *-TXID-* hit enter and it would say no TXID and go back to the  choices

[19-Feb-19 08:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Do you want/need me to try and test it some more right now?

[19-Feb-19 08:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was excited to join a game

[19-Feb-19 08:44 PM] TonyL#3577
If you found something working not correct -feel free to report

[19-Feb-19 08:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I noted this `Check if somebody selling warrior` item - will fix it tomorrow

[19-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I got my thoughts confused a bit here ^ that  last bit was about joing a multiplayer game with the  R + E entries and such.

[19-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sorry it was abit ago and I have done a bunch of other things since.

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
E + enter = proceed to the next step (game txid choosing)

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
R + enter = refresh games list

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Ctrl + C = back to main menu

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah ok so type ``e``

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
then enter

[19-Feb-19 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
I can make prints more clear - just wanted to make list refreshable on this place

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
```R + Enter - refresh list.
E + Enter - to the game choice.
CTRL + C - back to main menu``` it's waiting for capital `E` input

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I thought I was supposed to put a txid

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
CAPITAL E ... ok

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
and printing what it waiting üòÉ

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
But if multiplayer list is clear you need to create some first by `Create multiplayer game`

[19-Feb-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
And as I can see now - there is no multiplayer games

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So i tried to join a few, no luck
then I made one, couldnt join it. üòÇ

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Some errors or?

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok I think i need to update again, because...

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
```something went wrong 
txid```

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
happend on bailout of game

[19-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
fork?

[19-Feb-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha it means that daemon not returned txid after you tried to bailout

[19-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
noob'n ?

[19-Feb-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure why daemon not returned txid

[19-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I hadnt had any issues til I updated today. haha

[19-Feb-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI still broadcasting same bailouts as before üòÉ  Did you update daemon?

[19-Feb-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Can you execute`git log -1` in `~/komodo` and share output?

git pull
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[19-Feb-19 08:57 PM] TonyL#3577
There are may be various reasons: let's say you didn't rebuild or you didn't clean before build or you didn't start daemon with fresh build. So this sequence should eliminate all these cases
