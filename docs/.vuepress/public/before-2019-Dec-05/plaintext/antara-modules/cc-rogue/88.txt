[10-Mar-19 05:22 AM] wookie#7663
actually, I do have a personal pubkey= in my daemon start command

[10-Mar-19 05:24 AM] wookie#7663
I've been using the same pubkey that I got when I first started playing.

[10-Mar-19 05:24 AM] wookie#7663
I believe it's the same pubkey tied to my address?

[10-Mar-19 05:25 AM] wookie#7663
strange that my warrior got randomly transfered away?

[10-Mar-19 05:25 AM] TonyL#3577
If you not flushed wallet / moved things - yes

[10-Mar-19 05:25 AM] wookie#7663
erm, I don't even know what "flush" wallet or moving things is

[10-Mar-19 05:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually last game of this warrior was not gametxid which you've provided

[10-Mar-19 05:25 AM] TonyL#3577
` "gametxid": "d9f9d776e0f86a9c306ebe8866a92fc9a46b9bd676b58f674012760ce8aaa578",` it was this one

[10-Mar-19 05:27 AM] TonyL#3577
And looks like he died in this game

[10-Mar-19 06:03 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c If you'll have a chance - could you please check this game: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%2259666518492b4ee0b8e743058c1369845e4ab2dc91b093b84dbcdb29c41c0f0%22,%22039676b63e467d7f011faeb7c30068e7521eb8259817d57b8186ce37f9e3b23d70%22]\"```
Warrior counted as dead ```"extracted": "zero value character was killed -> no playerdata\n",``` but on last frame from replay he is quite alive

[10-Mar-19 06:05 AM] TonyL#3577
And last kestrokes are Qy `hhhhhhQy`, and no errors in `keystrokes.log`

[10-Mar-19 06:33 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes @TonyL. In my side everyting is working good, If i look something strange immedialetly write. Strenght > 20 Intresting case. (More strenght more food)

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Mar-19 07:30 AM] ronyi#5719
I tested strenght > 20 case. My strenght 21 and my inventory is contained strenght 20 items. I quit with strenght 21 and started new game with strenght 21.

[10-Mar-19 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
So maybe ring of sustain strength is a clue

[10-Mar-19 07:36 AM] ronyi#5719
I used ring of sustain strength in both cases just now my inventory was  less.

[10-Mar-19 07:39 AM] ronyi#5719
Now testing 21 strenght and full inventory again, lets see what i give the abyss. 😄

[10-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual strength is used, so if magic is enhancing it, it goes away when being extracted, as all magic is disabled then

[10-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the game is very strange indeed, @TonyL investigating. it looks like things are much better, but still edge cases left to fix

[10-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
what about windows? did deckers build make things work?

[10-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
extract game is giving "invalid game" error

[10-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Deckers build behave exactly same (he a little bit misunderstood initial state of things on win), so now he wrapping head over rogue logics as I know

[10-Mar-19 07:44 AM] ronyi#5719
i use gain strenght potions and ring of sustain strenght. Now my all items in my inventory intresting.

[10-Mar-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems right

[10-Mar-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
```extract game is giving "invalid game" error```
Ohh, missed one letter in gametxid @jl777c

```

[10-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
on the node that you played the game, there should be rogue.409...609.1, .2, .3 ... files

[10-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the total size of all those files?

[10-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie could you please `ls -la | grep rogue.4093377559412155609` in komodod directory when you'll have a chance?

[10-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
(it's not mine but wookie's game)

[10-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
he is running latest komodod?

[10-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
with the keystrokes fix

[10-Mar-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like a lost keystrokes

[10-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
He using bundle and bundle have 3 days old jl777 komodod

[10-Mar-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it's good idea to publish very latest daemon updated bundles

[10-Mar-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think anything changed in last 3 days though

[10-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used daemon in bundle after huge fixes oriented on keystrokes order

[10-Mar-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the replay log shows he went negative hp at 7667, so it does seem a missing keystrokes somehow

[10-Mar-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
by concatenating the .1, .2, ... files and comparing it to the .0 file, we can see what the difference in actual keystrokes vs keystrokes tx is. until then we are just guessing

[10-Mar-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Then share output of ```ls -la | grep rogue.gameseed```

[10-Mar-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and the same idea as the .0 vs .1+.2+.3... keystrokes files

[10-Mar-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a function that concatenates all the files is useful

@TonyL "You did ls -la before or after extract?" No.

[10-Mar-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
seems extract worked as it should. maybe it is a non-deterministic bug. if you do the replay, does the game diverge from what happened?

Only suspicious is that 7491 symbol in `keystrokes` key - should be 3745*2=7490 if I understand correct, but maybe one is some "service" one

[10-Mar-19 09:00 AM] ronyi#5719

@ronyi what percentage of games are working smoothly without any issues? approx

[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] ronyi#5719
uhh hard to say, but i think more than 95%

[10-Mar-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
good to hear, so just a few edge cases to understand and it will be ready. i think at 99% , we can just have various random behaviors be part of the game

[10-Mar-19 09:26 AM] ronyi#5719
In low levels with new or reused warriors no problem, but higher levels not always smoothly. Usually after lvl7 problems begin.

[10-Mar-19 09:37 AM] ronyi#5719
a lot of play to create strong warrior, that without problems farming above lvl 7. Begin at lvl3 R cause -strenght necessary (strenght potions or ring), above A cause armor problem (leather armor, but necessary enchant armor scrolls), and I didn't even talk about a weapon and hypothermia. 😄 i don't figured out an antidote to hypothermia

@Bryan_Beus ```I'm on my laptop and I don't have ROGUE installed here. Can anyone do me a favor real quick and run a search in the komodo/src/ directory for the keystrokes.log file?``` keystroke.log file creating in same folder with komodod
In case of default installation it will be `~/komodo/src`

Latest FSM synced fine on Linux - will rebuild latest FSM on OSX and try

Very strange both latest FSM and jl777 not syncing on OSX with ```newdata[656] != playerdata[656], numkeys.2946 RJHD68KaUg14DaooPz5VFXeTTh8qdpEseb pub.0325151cf0f7321d0cde232898c5adc6b60f32df71b79af3a49d10020d42925ae9 playertxid.ba46eea382a11f826ac8294c68c9bcb1839deb90cc8f1ca5767046fc499becc9 good.913 bad.150

While sync on Linux is fine on both - so it's seems like OS specific issue now. Will try now to build in new directory - maybe something not cleaned properly (but I deleted all exec and dylibs + cleaned in rogue folder before build)
