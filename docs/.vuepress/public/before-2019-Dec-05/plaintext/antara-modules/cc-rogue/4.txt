@siu - Chainmakers check my guide in channel topic or pinned, follow the commands in exact order

[09-Feb-19 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to do `./makerogue` before compiling komodo

[09-Feb-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
better to start with fresh clone

@Pumtchak you need to register new game each time after you die (for now)

[09-Feb-19 04:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So from this game a type of blockchain based DOOM can be done? Or a Zelda game?

updated jl777 branch with new version. it works now much better and has nonfungible token data for the playerdata, also a new rpc "players" that will display all your players. you should be able to register with the playertxid and start the dungeon with that character. side effect is that all the magic is deciphered. if this makes the game too easy, I can make it so only things that are actually known can be seen

latest now works with playerdata. you can register the txid of the bailout assuming it has playerdata and then you can continue developing your character with the next game

[10-Feb-19 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it should also work with tokenbid/ask, but that definitely needs to be tested

with this ROGUE is very close to feature complete. of course assuming no major bugs and the DEX functions work. I added some error checking, but I think it is still possible to end up in some bad states

yes, i'm testing single player

[11-Feb-19 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577 (pinned)
To test:
```
git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui 
cd komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
cp -r * ~/komodo/src
cd  ~/komodo/src
 ./rogue_tui.py ```

pip dependencies remained the same as before (can be found in repo readme). 
p.s. Your path to needed komodo might be different - it's just an example
p.p.s You need ROGUE daemon up
