good tip

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] jorian#4555
in level 6 i was in tunnels and had to press 's' repeatedly until a door or more tunnels showed up

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
door found lol

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
what's the furthest some ones got anyways?

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] jorian#4555
well it doesn't matter when you die all the time üòõ

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] jorian#4555
6 for me

[08-Feb-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this rogue ascii game vs graphical game is like reading vs watching video

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] gcharang#6833
So the blockchain will know the games status only if we give the bailout command right?

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jorian#4555
capital S?

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
when I get the playerdata working, you can start with a preexitng character

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
preexisting

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jorian#4555
and transfer that char right?

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jorian#4555
if you can sell it?

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jorian#4555
WTS lvl 28 ROGUE char

[08-Feb-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is sending keystrokes tx every level

[08-Feb-19 01:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[08-Feb-19 01:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[08-Feb-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we are working on making the playerdata a nonfungible token that can be bought and sold

[08-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the ingame gold is worth 0.001 ROGUE

[08-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
0.01 ROGUE if you win

[08-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jorian#4555
but when you die, your character is dead and cannot be revived or anything right? so that character you sell, must have been alive for all the levels etc.

[08-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jorian#4555
do all the items you scavenge transfer with the character too?

[08-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you can 'Q' at anytime to preserve the playerdata

[08-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
dying is not good

[08-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jorian#4555
Q being quit

[08-Feb-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so to cash in your ingame gold and preserve your pack items do a 'Q' and then a bailout tx

[08-Feb-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
then that txid can be used in a future register and the same character will be the one you start with. I dont have this part working yet, but I think I found all the changes needed

[08-Feb-19 01:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Whats your highest lvl so far JL?

[08-Feb-19 01:52 PM] jorian#4555
ever

[08-Feb-19 01:52 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
just on this cc rogue

[08-Feb-19 01:52 PM] jorian#4555
btw, the goal of the game is to find some key right?

[08-Feb-19 02:09 PM] SHossain#0007
make sure it's capital letter `Q` üòõ

[08-Feb-19 02:09 PM] jorian#4555
yeah my rogue is crashing all the time

[08-Feb-19 02:09 PM] jorian#4555
what did i dooo

[08-Feb-19 02:09 PM] jorian#4555
it must be going... rogue

[08-Feb-19 02:10 PM] jorian#4555
ah i think i know

[08-Feb-19 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
nope. @jl777c rogue keeps getting stuck after going down a level deeper

[08-Feb-19 02:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
To start a new game i just - ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]" and then use Hex again?

[08-Feb-19 02:18 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
throwing me erro code -25 error message when submitting new hex

[08-Feb-19 02:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
sorted it

[08-Feb-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you always need to send the hex

[08-Feb-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
anytime you see HEX for any CC, you need to broadcast it

[08-Feb-19 02:32 PM] jorian#4555
and now my daemon won't stop

[08-Feb-19 02:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Up and running again

[08-Feb-19 02:37 PM] gcharang#6833
`pgrep komodod` will give you a number
`kill -9 <the above number>`

[08-Feb-19 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
just use `pkill -15 komodod` or `pkill -9 komodod` if you only have ROGUE running in the test computer

[08-Feb-19 02:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c may I suggest/request you make this rouge game with your own custom hard to solve puzzles? and linked them with KMD as reward?
hard as if only the blockchain educated and more technical people can crack them.
idea is to make people learn about the capability you have coded to a truing complete game and make more technical people look into this.
as more technical eyes see this work, the higher the hope is we get more devs onboard.

[08-Feb-19 02:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
trying to combine @ca333 puzzles idea to rogue üòõ

üòÖ 

[08-Feb-19 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and as I understand "ready player one" story, that same kinda puzzles solving and giving high price rewards.... üòÅ

[08-Feb-19 02:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
even if those puzzles takes years to solve... I guess would be fair

[08-Feb-19 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
@jorian if you try to play the same game again after you died, the punishment is the daemon goes into an infinite loop

[08-Feb-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
dont have a check to prevent that yet, once you die or quit, you cant play that seed again

[08-Feb-19 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
not enough space at the bottom?

[08-Feb-19 02:59 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
enough  room

[08-Feb-19 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't see that behaviour in the few gameplays i had

[08-Feb-19 03:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[08-Feb-19 03:08 PM] gcharang#6833
I started a game, quit using `Q` while still alive, it gave me a hex. Broadcasted it. Then gave bailout command. It crashed like this

@gcharang play a clean game. komodod will stop if you try to cheat or do illegal operation

[08-Feb-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
bailout works

[08-Feb-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
make sure you are using latest code

[08-Feb-19 03:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Will build again. I am using yesterdays daemon still

[08-Feb-19 03:13 PM] jusoaresf#3291
where do we find ./makerogue ?

[08-Feb-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder I was thinking when ROGUE is more feature complete and stable, we can make a bunch of mm2 bids for ROGUE/KMD and people can convert it to KMD
