@KomodoWorld something for your blog, the last 60-70 messages.

[12-Feb-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
tokenized playerdata can now be used with register, at least if you created it. when you bailout it creates the playerdata and the txid is the playertxid. this appears in tokenlist as it should, since it is a token

[12-Feb-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
when you register with it, you burn the playerdata and it is recreated inside the dungeon, but you are recreated without wearing any armor or wielding any weapon, so make sure to w and W

[12-Feb-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
after the playerdata is burned via the register, it properly disappears from the tokenlist. Maybe there are hardforking changes from a few hours ago. not sure. updating daily is a good idea anyway, especially at this stage and pace of development. I will test the using of traded playerdata, but is uses mostly the same codepath as using a self created, so it has a decent chance to work

[12-Feb-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
once that function is there, I think it is just the bug fixes remaining and then adding validation and dPoW. the latter 2 are not really game play visible so I am doing it last

[12-Feb-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
thanks to @dimxy for getting the token CC updated to properly handle nonfungible assets of large size

[12-Feb-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
just confirmed a sync from scratch works, so if you cant sync to mainchain, just do a total resync

[12-Feb-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, there is a inifinite loop i havent fixed yet that happens if you issue a rogue tx when a dependent one is not confirmed. that is an important one to fix, but for now, be patient and wait for confirmations, the Hobgoblin can wait for a minute
