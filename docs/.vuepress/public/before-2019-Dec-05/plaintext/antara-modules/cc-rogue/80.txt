Only `.0` aren't empty

[03-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, thats why I have progress only for 1 level maybe

[03-Mar-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
no, that was a bug i fixed in unix, but it didnt make it into the windows build. doesnt affect things as nothing is using it yet

[03-Mar-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the .0 file having keystrokes means it found at least one keystrokes tx

such a simple game doesnt extract on windows?

[03-Mar-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i get an error on that short game too, trying to extract it. so it could be an edge case windows stumbled into. will investigate

[03-Mar-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
zero value character was killed -> no playerdata

[03-Mar-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that is what "error" meant. i should make that better

awthanks 

[03-Mar-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i was able to extract 256 keystrokes from that game

killed by hobgoblin you said

[03-Mar-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
`jlfl flll` in this one was killed

[03-Mar-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
In game from paste I was very alive

[03-Mar-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
does the game replay show the same rooms?

[03-Mar-19 07:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Just choosen bad example with hobgoblin first - it's different bug I think

[03-Mar-19 07:39 AM] TonyL#3577
For game from paste I got error on extract call

[03-Mar-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the nondeterministic replay. i am wondering if we have os specific issues with that

[03-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have any game in windows that worked at all?

[03-Mar-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Zero

[03-Mar-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Two states: or error on extract, or extract only dl1

[03-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but you are getting keystrokes in the rogue.seed.0 file that matches what was played?

[03-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do: cc/rogue/rogue seed and have it display the replay, are the rooms the same?

[03-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll check it after lunch, just discovered for me these keystrokes log files

[03-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
extract creates the .0 file

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Ahh it's not created during the game?

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the .1, .2, ... are but a bug truncated all of them. it is fixed in the latest src

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought it's different one which logging playee keystrokes input

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
.1, .2, .3 are logging the keystrokes

{Reactions}
👌 

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but truncated due to the bug

[03-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810

just need a new windows rebuild

[03-Mar-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but windows seems to have much more serious problems

[03-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Got it

[03-Mar-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i am wondering if you even get the same set of rooms with the same seed

[03-Mar-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so what happens if you play seed 777 ? does it give you the expected rooms (with 2 handed sword in one of them)

[03-Mar-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like even with the same keystrokes, the gamereplay is totally wrong

[03-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
are you using the arrow keys or numeric keypad?

maybe there is a mismatch in the keystrokes used vs. saved/replayed

[03-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
It's same room as before on 777 seed

[03-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm using arrow keys only

[03-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
use just the letters

[03-Mar-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for movement can be with hjklyubn

[03-Mar-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try

[03-Mar-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and a very basic one to see if the replay is the same

[03-Mar-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577

hex is a better way to display than binary

00011001 -> 25 which is a control char

[03-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810

Yesterday created 2 warriors and now finded 3 rings in game and quit, everythings looked like normal, but i lost 1 warrior. unfortunately i noted not my gametxid and bailout txid. I using this komodo commit 62cea0f4e863f3861054a8e35bcccdd8bdf766bd and  tui commit e1a4281a7fd8b381040681bb79c7bc56e276ba22. Do i update?

@TonyL that 256 char game is very strange. the replay is a bit silly, but it isnt dying, yet the blockchain daemon is saying dead. investigating... but this wont be fast at all
