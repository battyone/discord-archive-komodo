can I just start a game and bailout?

[12-Feb-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
does it need a playertxid? I tried just immediate bailout and it worked fine

[12-Feb-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Games without playertxid

[12-Feb-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to quit right after you reached lvl3

[12-Feb-19 06:07 PM] TonyL#3577
And bailout then

[12-Feb-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
On first level I've tried as well and daemon never hanged

[12-Feb-19 06:09 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c given my situation from the last game where bailout didn't work. now i tried after more than 10 minutes and `bailout` command made it infinite loop.

[12-Feb-19 06:09 PM] SHossain#0007
same txid i used

[12-Feb-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
do i need to play level 1 and 2 or can i just dive down to 3 as fast as possible

[12-Feb-19 06:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I've dived as fast as possible in case when it hanged

[12-Feb-19 06:16 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive spent at least 30 mins taking my time and then did a bail and it looped but the tx went thru

Random hint:  bow helps a lot on low levels. Equip it and throw arrows then by `t`

`1   250 : killed on level 6 by hypothermia.`

[12-Feb-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
is that a monster?

[12-Feb-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you can also throw food, basically anything, but the damage is usually limited. i saw that in the code, it was funny

[12-Feb-19 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007
not sure if that is a monster. doc doesn't have the word `hypothermia`

[12-Feb-19 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007
i just basically jumping in levels

[12-Feb-19 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007

[12-Feb-19 07:39 PM] SHossain#0007
no stdout prints for this loop

[12-Feb-19 07:40 PM] ca333#0118
hypothermia means it was too cold

[12-Feb-19 07:40 PM] ca333#0118
so a ice monster killed you most likely

if not mistaken - i caught this info somewhere but might be mixing 80s genre games contents

[12-Feb-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there is an icemonster.maybe it can freeze you from a distance

[12-Feb-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but the hang is still there?

[12-Feb-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL I see what you mean about getting a list of your current games. I closed one of my tabs that had the gametxid and now having a hard time locating the game

[12-Feb-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess I will have to make a mygames rpc call to find it üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 07:59 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't find any more hang. trying to find hang. üòÉ

[12-Feb-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, I misunderstood: "daemon went on loop
no stdout prints for this loop"

[12-Feb-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so that didnt mean hang?

[12-Feb-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
it did hang. but, no printouts for that.
now, trying to reproduce it

[12-Feb-19 08:21 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. if you die on any level and issue `bailout` for that game, daemon goes to infinite loop without printing error

[12-Feb-19 08:21 PM] SHossain#0007
only stdout i have is

[12-Feb-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! dying is a different code path.

[12-Feb-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so does it matter if you bailout right away or wait till keystrokes is confirmed?

[12-Feb-19 08:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i bailed out right away. will wait for mempool to be cleared before using bailout next

[12-Feb-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also if you can confirm that bailing out right away hangs, that will help

[12-Feb-19 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i did bailout twice right away after i was killed and both time the daemon went on infinite loop

[12-Feb-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why I never run into this! I always Q if I am in danger to preserve my playerdata

[12-Feb-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
