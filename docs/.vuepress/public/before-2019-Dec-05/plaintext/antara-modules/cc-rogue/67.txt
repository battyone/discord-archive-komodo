Not matters who created the singleplayer game transaction

[25-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
maybe do it in coinbase?

[25-Feb-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Anybody can play it

[25-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
every block would have a new game tx?

[25-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Just permanently will be let's say 100 already mined singleplayer games

[25-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Same way Sudoku working

[25-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
There are thousands of pre-generated games - and on new game start I'm just randomly choosing one in GUI

[25-Feb-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist And if implement such games generation there will not be a loading screen (this "Waiting for gametxid to be mined") at all

[25-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
can likely just run a blocknotify script that checks oracle, if there are <100, add some until there are 100 then update oracle

[25-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
TUI reads oracle, picks one and starts

[25-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
it's quite a bit of spam added to the chain, but it's a good idea

[25-Feb-19 09:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Why need oracle? I can scan `games ["pending"]` list for singleplayer games and know exact quantity in any time

[25-Feb-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
how do you know you generated it?

[25-Feb-19 09:23 PM] Alright#0419
and you're not just taking someone else's?

[25-Feb-19 09:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I just really liked the loading screens from the old games. 😃

[25-Feb-19 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure if problem of re-usage someones freely generated game (it will happens super not-often) worth connection of oracle

[25-Feb-19 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Nothing stops you now make a script and permanently steal games

[25-Feb-19 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
So CLI users will not able to play because your script registers faster

[25-Feb-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
*makes a script and permanently steals games* :troll:

{Reactions}
troll_compadre 

[25-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
why does new game tx need to be confirmed before using it?

[25-Feb-19 09:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Because register call will not generate transaction if it's not mined - I'm not sure about exact reasons of such implementation

[25-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
think maybe it's using blockhash as entropy, not sure that's implemented though

[25-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Alright#0419
if that's not the case, I'm not sure why it couldn't spend from mempool

[25-Feb-19 09:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway testing of warriors/progress not-saving in long games, testing of dex features and especially multiplayer games seems more important on this point than this clue with pre-generated games

[25-Feb-19 09:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Multiplayer almost untested at all

[25-Feb-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
progress not saving sounds like rogue app failing to communicate via rpc

[25-Feb-19 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
that's my experience at least

[25-Feb-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
I've played maybe 500 games and haven't gone past level 1 😂

[25-Feb-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
just testing booting into games and saving warriors

[25-Feb-19 09:36 PM] TonyL#3577
There were many different problems, most interesting was when progress not saved because of `Q+n` keys (rogue thought that any Q is game finish)

[25-Feb-19 09:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill be back in about 14 hours to test multiplayer  and dex tony

[25-Feb-19 09:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Last bit of kiddo birthday and family obligations for a bit is today.

[25-Feb-19 09:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool! I think I'll be available at this time and we can do some PVP

[25-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
and then i can reload ROGUE 18937692649269642 times

[25-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it usually seems busy when i wake up at that time.

[25-Feb-19 09:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe someone else will join and will try tournament 😃

[25-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah! Ill be stoked to get one to load!

[25-Feb-19 09:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have 200 rogue to lose!

[25-Feb-19 09:45 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL where do I unzip your 0.11n update to? komodo/src folder?

[25-Feb-19 09:46 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie  it have daemon inside, so no matters

[25-Feb-19 09:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Just start the daemon from zip

[25-Feb-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
In zip there are komodo daemon, rogue and TUI

[25-Feb-19 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
So you may just stop your current daemon and start daemon from bundle if your daemon isnt updated (daemon in bundle built with all latest fixes except of order cancelled warriors usage in game)

[25-Feb-19 09:49 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks! trying it out now!

[25-Feb-19 09:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Great! Please let me know if it works :)

How can we check game replay?

[25-Feb-19 10:52 PM] Strob#3417
@ronyi Wow 20 rogue in one game! So it really pays more when on higher level I guess! it's a really fun game for an ASCII game!

[25-Feb-19 11:04 PM] TonyL#3577
@Strob ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22gametxid%22,%22pubkey%22]\"``` after execution in output you'll see the command to start replay

[25-Feb-19 11:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Current gold cashing formula in singleplayer is:
`extracted_rogue_satoshies = gold * gold * dungeon_level * 10 `

[25-Feb-19 11:55 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL 0.11n works great so far! Warriors are saved just fine. And gold is converting to ROGUE appropriately!

[26-Feb-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL I will add the latest playertxid for the tokenid for playerinfo call later today

that pastebin, it seems the game never started but it registered your player?

I created a new game with TUI and inserted my player id and i got "invalid gametxid, or already started" and immadiate bailout.

@jl777c Thank you!

[26-Feb-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the TUI needs to not bailout of games without any keystrokes tx

Interesting case - register mined fine but rogue not started game by some reason with "invalid gametxid, or already started"  never saw it on my side. 
Will add check if >0 keystrokes were mined before bailout

Now you can try to issue bailout manually in cli to finish this game

[26-Feb-19 11:09 AM] barv#0867
How do I do that?

[26-Feb-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed version that displays gametxid and batontxid for playerinfo. You can start with any playertxid (from tokenid to latest unspent) and it will trace the spends to find where the unspent token is and that is the batontxid. it should then be easy to see if that tx is a DEX tx or not

[26-Feb-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
I can add some batonstatus info if that is not easy for your

Thanks @jl777c ! Will try to play with this new info to fix warriors scanner

[26-Feb-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
based on what I know, it seems keystrokes tx reliability is the only core issue left?

[26-Feb-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems so - there are few reports that dead warrior is not dead (I checked replay and just few last keystrokes not included) + this keystrokes "corrupting" with death

yes, both cases of alive players dead and dead players alive are explained by missed keystrokes in the middle and missed keystrokes at the end
