Is there a way to make the used arrows count as just used arrows and not new line items?

[19-Feb-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
No, it's a magic arrows

In original game it's just 23 items as I understand

Please help, human!
Error: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 227 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

@ernest22 spacebar is kind of enter button on this game

[19-Feb-19 03:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[19-Feb-19 03:14 PM] ernest22#3321
nice

[19-Feb-19 03:14 PM] ernest22#3321
Maybe it would be better just to have the control menu shown below of the game

[19-Feb-19 03:15 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Oh wow all of my warriors are in the top 10

I was trying to join you

[19-Feb-19 03:22 PM] ernest22#3321
Something went wrong. Maybe you're trying to register on game twice or don't have enough funds to pay buyin.
'txid'

Windows build of komodo Rogue is fixed - we will push it online for testing shortly.

[19-Feb-19 03:34 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
errrm. i dont know why but i can seem to go off the right hand of the screen and mess up my whole map. üò¶

[19-Feb-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007
% means the next level

[19-Feb-19 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
use `>` when you are on it to go to next level

[19-Feb-19 03:36 PM] jeezy#3408

[19-Feb-19 03:40 PM] ernest22#3321
all of us are on single player right?

[19-Feb-19 03:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
if you just started playing on your own, yes.

[19-Feb-19 03:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The standard  is single player (nicknamed Roguelander)

[19-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Waiting for game transaction to be mine 
"Building Dungeons" "Raising Dead" "drawing maps"
@TonyL  if that one can be different each time that would be cool. 
that is how it is in Lego Worlds

[19-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
**Please Note**: If you exit a game, you unequipped everything. So when you use a saved Warrior token, you need to re-equip upon the start of the game! Both armor and weapon!

when i compile komodo on macOS i get this error ``configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO`` and then it stops

[19-Feb-19 04:19 PM] LeFevre#5755
Ah, I saw ca333 say "WIndows build of komodo Rogue is fixed - we will push it online for testing shortly."

[19-Feb-19 04:20 PM] LeFevre#5755
assumed there was one then

[19-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah, understood

[19-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
No it isn't ready as of yet.

[19-Feb-19 04:21 PM] SHossain#0007

So far I was able to put a warrior up for sale and cancel a sale, pretty easily. Looking at the list of warrios didnt work for me and then booted me from rogue ^

[19-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Meyse#0952
no one knows what this means when compiling komodo (macOS)
``checking whether the linker accepts -Wl,-z,relro... no``
``configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO`` ?

[19-Feb-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
brew install boost

[19-Feb-19 05:55 PM] SHossain#0007
@Meyse maybe you used `./zcutil/build.sh -j8` instead of `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`

[19-Feb-19 06:04 PM] Meyse#0952
@SHossain this isnt in the instructions, but yeah thanks!

@SHossain maybe good idea to add full komodod installation instructions or to add a link in the rogue instructions..

[19-Feb-19 06:13 PM] Meyse#0952
would be nice to put this also in the instructions üòÑ

[19-Feb-19 06:13 PM] SHossain#0007

[19-Feb-19 06:15 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 the instructions there are actually taken from our komodo build guide

[19-Feb-19 06:15 PM] SHossain#0007
does users need `xcode select install` commands?

[19-Feb-19 06:15 PM] ca333#0118
i see stuff is missing

[19-Feb-19 06:16 PM] ca333#0118
i will add it later today (OSX specific deps, etc.)

[19-Feb-19 06:16 PM] Meyse#0952
much appreciated

[19-Feb-19 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
if you let me know the missing parts, i can get them updated in all places

[19-Feb-19 06:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@Meyse use this in terminal and try again please `xcode-select --install`
