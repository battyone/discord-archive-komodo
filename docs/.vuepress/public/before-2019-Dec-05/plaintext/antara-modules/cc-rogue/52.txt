@Cryptofist I can try to document how to set it up. Not sure how many instances of the daemon I can reliably run though

[20-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Cryptofist#7504
That'd be cool. If you cant no big deal. I'll look for some info on remote stuff myself sometime.

[20-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Making a bit of a commitment to learn a little each day

[20-Feb-19 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
@Cryptofist just struggling to get the dependencies for TUI installed atm

[20-Feb-19 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
if I can at least get the TUI running on windows, the daemon can be ran on linux easily

[20-Feb-19 03:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So Rogue & TUI worked fine until I updated to the new  versions. now I cant get them to work at all.

[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
Ah is the TUI not usable right now?

[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
probably something simple to devs that  I do not get

[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
something in the daemon change?

[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
It aesthetically functions, but it isnt loading my tokens or saving them when i Q a game

[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I think so man, something like that.

[20-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I  might try and go and estart it all again fresh builds.

[20-Feb-19 03:53 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I was trying to record some TUI use for instructions.

[20-Feb-19 06:27 AM] joe2x4#5987
Reinstalled Ubuntu. Working through steps. Made it to step 1 start chain. Terminal stalled at 'some-address' good 71 bad 24.  Tried to scroll up on terminal and it returned me to command prompt. System monitor says komodod is running and it appears is dl something. Guess I wait.

[20-Feb-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if it printed good 71 bad 24, that means you are most likely in sync

[20-Feb-19 06:44 AM] joe2x4#5987
Executing step 4. At bottom says komodo rogue server starting. Then command prompt with Error: Cannot obtain a lockon data directory. Komodo is probably already running.

[20-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
@joe2x4 what OS are you using?

[20-Feb-19 06:47 AM] joe2x4#5987
Ubuntu

[20-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
can you try 
```
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo```

[20-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
replace `~/komodo/src` if you cloned komodo somewhere else

[20-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Alright#0419
see if the daemon is responding basically

[20-Feb-19 06:48 AM] joe2x4#5987
Ok, what am I looking for

[20-Feb-19 06:48 AM] joe2x4#5987
I typed that in

[20-Feb-19 06:49 AM] Alright#0419
what did it respond with?

[20-Feb-19 06:49 AM] joe2x4#5987
A list

[20-Feb-19 06:49 AM] joe2x4#5987
Blocks are at 25215

[20-Feb-19 06:49 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so the daemon is up. What is the problem?

[20-Feb-19 06:50 AM] joe2x4#5987
Am getting errors whilst working through the guide

[20-Feb-19 06:50 AM] joe2x4#5987
Unsure if even working

[20-Feb-19 06:50 AM] Alright#0419
What step are you at?

[20-Feb-19 06:51 AM] joe2x4#5987
Step 2 in manual. Register a new game

[20-Feb-19 06:51 AM] joe2x4#5987
Says transaction already in chain, error code -27

[20-Feb-19 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
ignore it

[20-Feb-19 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
keep going

[20-Feb-19 06:52 AM] joe2x4#5987
Ok

[20-Feb-19 07:00 AM] joe2x4#5987
Boo,. Worked way to step 6. Already played 
findbaton err.-5
Invalid gametxid, or already started

[20-Feb-19 07:03 AM] joe2x4#5987
Hmm, didn't get the same output listed on step 5. Nothing below 
Slot 0

[20-Feb-19 07:06 AM] joe2x4#5987
Ugh, must have gotten confused on which terminal was the right one and loaded some commands on the terminal that had been loading the block chain. 😑

[20-Feb-19 07:06 AM] joe2x4#5987
F it. Will try again tomorrow.

[20-Feb-19 07:44 AM] ronyi#5719

@Alright Hi, Did you get through the `egg` error?  I was having trouble with that yesterday also.
`sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel slick-bitcoinrpc` helped.  
smk762 also mentioned this ```not sure if needed, but I had to add this to pos64staker to install slickrpc https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/pull/5```

[20-Feb-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@ronyi how did you get ROGUE working on iPhone?

[20-Feb-19 07:55 AM] ca333#0118
he s connected to server

[20-Feb-19 07:55 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes. 😃

[20-Feb-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I can see it now, ROGUE access servers charging ROGUE coins to play

[20-Feb-19 08:17 AM] anyyna#1521
Hey! Can i play the game from windows?

[20-Feb-19 08:18 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Install a Virtual Machine and then install ubuntu, then yes you can!

[20-Feb-19 08:19 AM] anyyna#1521
Ok i will try thank you

[20-Feb-19 08:19 AM] Cryptofist#7504
You can *try* the ubuntu terminal app from the microsoft store, but I have not had great luck wit it, it draws the maps weirdly and has some odd text issues when running commands

[20-Feb-19 08:19 AM] ca333#0118
and in addition we are working on a native windows build. The rogue CC activated komodod already builds/works. We re working on the last piece - the game binary for WIN.

[20-Feb-19 08:20 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I used Oracle VM, then added ubuntu and had absolutely no install problems.

[20-Feb-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
```Game is finished!

Something went wrong
-'txid'-``` Is it the actual problem atm?

[20-Feb-19 08:20 AM] Cryptofist#7504
That is gonna be great, opens up for so many more people.

[20-Feb-19 08:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Not any more.  Thank you though

{Reactions}
👌 

[20-Feb-19 08:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Well on one machine anyway, I haven't gone back to mess with the other, they both oddly had the same issue with txid for a while.

[20-Feb-19 08:22 AM] jeezy#3408
what are the current steps to update?

[20-Feb-19 08:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I think theyre pinned in #rogue

[20-Feb-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you running TUI from `~/komodo/src` ?

[20-Feb-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
`[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'cc/rogue/rogue'` this error is quite clear

[20-Feb-19 08:36 AM] jeezy#3408
yea ran it from  your repo

[20-Feb-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean folder from which you run it
There is a step in update `cp -r * ~/komodo/src`
So then you need to `cd ~/komodo/src` and then run TUI

[20-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
It can't find path to rogue if you run it from let's say `~/komodo/src/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui`

[20-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jeezy#3408

[20-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jeezy#3408
also setting name doesnt seem to work?

[20-Feb-19 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha it should proceed next and ask you which player name you want to choose

[20-Feb-19 08:38 AM] jeezy#3408
Score Name
 1   127 : killed on level 1 by a hobgoblin.

[20-Feb-19 08:39 AM] TonyL#3577
If you're killed no need name 😃

[20-Feb-19 08:39 AM] jeezy#3408
Game is finished!

Something went wrong.
'txid'

[20-Feb-19 08:39 AM] TonyL#3577
But if you will survive and bailout with alive player - after bailout transaction is mined you'll see player in your players list and name will be here

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm bailout not sent by some reason

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to play some

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] jeezy#3408
how to quit alive?

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Shift + Q, then y

[20-Feb-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
But you have to kill at least one monster and collect not 0 gold if you want your warrior to be saved

[20-Feb-19 08:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c there are a lot of reports when `bailout` in singleplayer game not generating transaction - may it be connected to outdated daemon version?  TUI just sending `cclib bailout 17 gametxid`

[20-Feb-19 08:42 AM] jeezy#3408
how do you get coins?

[20-Feb-19 08:42 AM] jeezy#3408
is the gold I collect = $ROGUE?

[20-Feb-19 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577
When you playing singleplayer - each gold ->  0.001 ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it works for me, does it work for you?

[20-Feb-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Works for me as well

[20-Feb-19 08:43 AM] jeezy#3408
only if you quit alive or also if you die?

[20-Feb-19 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh sorry, actually it's not 0.001 but 0.0005 in singleplayer, but 0.001 in multiplayer

[20-Feb-19 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, should receive for dead or alive

[20-Feb-19 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
But when you quit alive you may prepare really strong warrior

[20-Feb-19 08:46 AM] jeezy#3408
sometimes game creation takes a very long time

[20-Feb-19 08:46 AM] jeezy#3408
do we need more mining power on the chain?

[20-Feb-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
game creation = mining of game transaction what is usually = next block

[20-Feb-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
I don't think block-time will change dramatically in case of more mining power

[20-Feb-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Difficulty just adjust to keep blocktime

[20-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Blocktime is average thing - so some might be longer some might be faster

[20-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Can print ascii kitties on loading if it very boring 😃

[20-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Or unicorns

[20-Feb-19 08:51 AM] jeezy#3408
whats the target 60s?

[20-Feb-19 08:51 AM] jeezy#3408
so on average you have to wait a minute  thats acceptable I guess

[20-Feb-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think it's around minute
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/charts/block-interval I believe shows interval between blocks

[20-Feb-19 08:52 AM] jeezy#3408
the important question being

[20-Feb-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Some 6 minutes, some 4 seconds

[20-Feb-19 08:53 AM] jeezy#3408
when lootboxes?

[20-Feb-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Lootboxes?
