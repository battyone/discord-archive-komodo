I'm playing on latest daemon and don't have such bailout problems

[20-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to update, restart daemon and bailout manually then

[20-Feb-19 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
So 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22 6fbde4aa874291057970bc25dcf304a71b51079abef944e5ee3b0d4a1eca96ea
%22]\"
``` is call which you'll need

[20-Feb-19 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
So it's worked after some waiting?

[20-Feb-19 11:39 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, i think.

[20-Feb-19 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I may try to add broadcasting of bailout until it gets txid if waiting resolve the probelm

[20-Feb-19 11:41 AM] jeezy#3408
I also play on latest pull and sometime get bailout error

[20-Feb-19 11:43 AM] TonyL#3577
If you see such cases please try to re-broadcast bailout manually ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"
``` this way in some time.
If it helps - I'll modify TUI code to handle such cases

[20-Feb-19 11:47 AM] ronyi#5719
thank you

[20-Feb-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Pushed patch which should handle such cases to TUI `rogue` branch

[20-Feb-19 11:58 AM] jeezy#3408
thx

[20-Feb-19 11:58 AM] jeezy#3408
will update and try latest

[20-Feb-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
It will try to do bailout each 5 seconds until receive hex and txid back, so if there any cases when waiting not help to get txid from bailout - you will need to stop it manually by Ctrl + C and reopen TUI. Temporary brut-force solution since problem isn't determined yet

[20-Feb-19 12:31 PM] jeezy#3408
for the contest only selffarmed gold counts or also sold warriors?

[20-Feb-19 12:31 PM] jeezy#3408
what counts as gameplay here

[20-Feb-19 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c  wrote "legit gameplay farming or multiplayer" not sure if trades counting in this contest

[20-Feb-19 12:36 PM] jeezy#3408
if you save and want to return you start a fresh dungeon?

[20-Feb-19 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Any new game you start from lvl1 of dungeon - only warrior state is saving

Flytraps are tricky - sometimes they catch you by diagonal, and you need to hit them in diagonal direction

never seen a flytrap yet

[20-Feb-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
if you die, you dont get any gold and playerdata is gone

[20-Feb-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
buying and selling playerdata is legitimate way of earning ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
what does not count would be mining or working around the rpc validations

[20-Feb-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
some windows issues identified, like system() call likely not working right and ./komodo-cli not being there

[20-Feb-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so in addiition to the first 777 prize, there will also be a second one to allow windows uses a chance

[20-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Alright#0419
I think I have it working by using a wrapper named "komodo-cli"

[20-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
I still need to test building rogue app on windows

[20-Feb-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
not saying I have it even close to done, but I think the concept of windows user just running rogue app and TUI and interfacing with a remote daemon will work

hm i saved my game from last night but my warrior seems to have disappeared

[20-Feb-19 03:02 PM] nael55#5863
also i'm not getting any rogue added to my balance

[20-Feb-19 03:02 PM] nael55#5863
quitting w/ shift + Q

[20-Feb-19 03:02 PM] nael55#5863
using same pubkey

[20-Feb-19 03:03 PM] nael55#5863
"check my warriors list" yields no warriors

[20-Feb-19 03:05 PM] nael55#5863
i was playing with "God" and i see someone else can see the warrior exists

[20-Feb-19 03:09 PM] nael55#5863
well now i started a new game w/ [6] and God is back

[20-Feb-19 03:09 PM] nael55#5863
and getbalance shows i have some rogue!

[20-Feb-19 03:10 PM] nael55#5863
problem appears to have solved itself by waiting

[20-Feb-19 03:23 PM] jeezy#3408
I also cant see my warriors anymore

[20-Feb-19 03:23 PM] jeezy#3408
updated to latest, etc

[20-Feb-19 03:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

is it a bug that stuff is identified after exiting and joining back in?

[20-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
@jeezy do you mean things like scrolls?

[20-Feb-19 03:28 PM] jeezy#3408
yea

[20-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
I think the "bug" was already discussed here

[20-Feb-19 03:28 PM] Alright#0419
it's a feature üòõ

[20-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
because you can decode them, it makes more sense to show user anyway

[20-Feb-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
so hacker can't get an advantage

[20-Feb-19 03:41 PM] jeezy#3408
so I joined a multiplayer game, played until lvl 7, quit with ctrl+q and the warrior is not showing

[20-Feb-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i had daemon crashed or stopped  twice today. now started with `gdb` and it is no longer stopping

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] nael55#5863
what is `gdb`?

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
debug tool to get bracktrace data

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] nael55#5863
how would i start with gdb

[20-Feb-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
did you get any crash?

[20-Feb-19 03:51 PM] nael55#5863
i did a few min ago but it may have been ISP

[20-Feb-19 03:51 PM] nael55#5863
have had many issues w/ ISP dropping

[20-Feb-19 03:51 PM] nael55#5863

follow this guide and use the ROGUE start param instead of default komodo as the guide says

[20-Feb-19 03:52 PM] SHossain#0007
example
```
gdb -args ./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -pubkey=0395c79875b36dab6e218f6315052754df8d7d8692b24342b2cce102c542c0de6d -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon
```

[20-Feb-19 03:53 PM] nael55#5863
ok thanks...will try that if it happens again

[20-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
think it may need to be `--args` as opposed to `-args`

[20-Feb-19 03:55 PM] Alright#0419
both may work though, not sure

[20-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Good Morning Everyone.
Some responses.  Loot boxes are fun, we can figure some thing out. I did want to do some character drops to the community after OS installers are 100%.  That is kind of the same thing for what we are working with.  @jeezy 
Thank you for the RT and support @benohanlon !  Who is the interview with?

I have worked out some great engagement on twitter in the non-crypto community over the last few days, a decent sized game marketing account even shared Rogue. The reach of this account is doing quite well given the age of it.

[20-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Yes, JL posted when making sure those of us working on  Rogue were disqualified.
