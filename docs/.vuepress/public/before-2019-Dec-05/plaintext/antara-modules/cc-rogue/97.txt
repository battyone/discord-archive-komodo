Restarting daemon and playing without rings, but i think use another warrior.

[19-Mar-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
So daemon restart not help, rings not the issue, and I can't reproduce on my side :/

Built-in keyboard -> no see arrow keys.

[19-Mar-19 09:36 AM] wookie#7663
So I've played a few games on the new MacOS bundle. Since none of my warriors have slow digestion ring, I almost never use rings.  I haven't had any issues so far. I've also made it a point to restart the daemon between games.

I'm started to think now that you have not updated rogue

Am I understand correct that you have Ubuntu 16.04 ?

[19-Mar-19 10:30 AM] ronyi#5719
Distributor ID: Ubuntu

[19-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
I have 18 ubuntu - thats why portable daemon not working maybe  (there is older libc in 16.04 - not sure why prebuilt demon requires it)

[19-Mar-19 10:32 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just in case - can you put rogue from bundle `cc/rogue/rogue` to your `/cc/rogue` ?

[19-Mar-19 10:34 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes of course.

[19-Mar-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577

@wookie Is it fine without re-starts as well?

[19-Mar-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I've built everything on `VERSION="18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"` so maybe it's some Xenial deps specific issue @ronyi if daemon compiled on my PC not starting on yours

[19-Mar-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi can you play with same pubkey/wallet on other platform  bundle(OSX or Windows) with same playstyle as on your Ubuntu?

[19-Mar-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
If it will be smooth on other platform - we'll isolate issue this way to some incompatible deps / OS version specifics

[19-Mar-19 10:45 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes i can. Now copyed rogue file. "Old rogue file": 857224 m√°rc  19 10:52 rogue Bundle rogue file: 957472 m√°rc  19 11:43 rogue

[19-Mar-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
One built on my side is bigger hmm, but I've built from latest jl777 (there were no updates in rogue code since I've published bundles)

[19-Mar-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Atm occam's razor leads to the idea that the problem is specific to this machine

[19-Mar-19 10:54 AM] ronyi#5719

Hmm just lost some progress on my side!

[19-Mar-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Not used any rings, just used identification scrolls,  armor and weapon enchacing scrolls

[19-Mar-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Will investigate replay now

[19-Mar-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
In games where everything was smooth on my side I've not readed scrolls at all

[19-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
But my replay behaves different - it just interrupting on some place

[19-Mar-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
where diverges is the non-det

[19-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I've read different scrolls on this place

[19-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Enchanced weapon and armor - these calls I can see

[19-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Then I've used potion identification scroll - I think it's interrupting after it

[19-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Issue in my game is almost definetly in scrolls

[19-Mar-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 "[%22d3c30f0ea6eecd55687e5ee38ef0cb559b24ee64e7a02b9f7073ecb8ed1e45a4%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]"

[19-Mar-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
potion identification, you end up inputting text

[19-Mar-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Inputting text?

[19-Mar-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, not using call command

[19-Mar-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry, confused identification with identify

[19-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Identification scrolls renaming items in inventory

[19-Mar-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
problem is that the replay is wrong too. keystrokes match, so only the game you played was correct and there is no way to duplicate that...

[19-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I've not recorded video unfortunately

[19-Mar-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
But I think games where I'm not used scrolls - were fine 5 from 5

[19-Mar-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess what we need to do is identify the exact point of divergence for each non-det and then see if a pattern emerges. i will look at identify scroll potion to see it rng usage

[19-Mar-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
First game where I've used identification scrolls interrupting on moment where I used it

[19-Mar-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
is it any scroll or just specific ones?

[19-Mar-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, that is a big clue!

[19-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
I can see in replay that enchancement scrolls worked fine

[19-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
And after it few keystrokes playing same as it was in game

[19-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Then I'm picking up white potion

[19-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
And I'm totally sure that on this place I've used potion identification scroll - but replay just stops on it

[19-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
oh it is a potion that messed things up?

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Most probably that it is

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
At least in this game

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to modify rogue.c to see list of all my actions to be sure

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
only create monster and sleep scrolls do any rng

[19-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, enchant also

[19-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
rnd()

[19-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Enchant hmm I've used enchant armor and enchant weapon on this place too

[19-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to change rogue.c to see all my actions

[19-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Im fully remember which scrolls I've used on this stop - so when I'll see where it interrupting I'll understand because of which scroll

[19-Mar-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there isnt an identify potion

[19-Mar-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used:
1) Identify scroll
2) Identify potion
3) Enchance armor
4) Enchance weapon

[19-Mar-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
what message did it show? "you sens the presence of magic..."

[19-Mar-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
You sense the presence of magic on this level. (! Magic Detection)

[19-Mar-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I never used such scroll

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
potion

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
what is identify potion, i see no such potion

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Identify potion scroll

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Not identify potion potion

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
aha!

[19-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so a scroll of identify potion

[19-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup

[19-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used two scrolls which changing items names in inventory: 1) scroll of identify scroll 2) scroll of identify potion

[19-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no rnd() calls with those scrolls. but maybe memory corruption from changing name

[19-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are not making user input, it just sets a flag that you know about that item

[19-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Also there is rnd() on armor/weap enchancement

[19-Mar-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
But after I've used enchancement scroll - I can see some progress after
