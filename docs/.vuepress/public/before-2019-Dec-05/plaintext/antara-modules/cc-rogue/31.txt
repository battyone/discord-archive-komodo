Q for quit

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So QUIT saves?

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Last state on replay i'm with 10hp  - state in room is correct as I remember but warrior showing lvl1 (actually he was level 7) and loot not correct

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
quit saves to the blockhain when you do a bailout

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
s* is what i used

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Aha, I have an idea - if it counting all warriors as lvl1 with 12hp - if I have 50hp actually and somebody hit me on 15hp

[16-Feb-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm like a dead

[16-Feb-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, at first level you need time to regen to full powers and also to wear and wield

[16-Feb-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577
But I was actually level7 not level1, but on replay I'm like a lvl1

[16-Feb-19 08:06 PM] TonyL#3577

[16-Feb-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
did you quit on level 1?

[16-Feb-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the second time

[16-Feb-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes I've quit on level1 of dungeon in this game

[16-Feb-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
dungeonlevel would be set to 1, but player level should be preserved if it showed it on startup

[16-Feb-19 08:09 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist You may save your warrior by `Shift + q` and then press `y + Enter`

[16-Feb-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there is something strange with the recreation of the dungeon too. I fixed the infinite loop

[16-Feb-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but the replay is wrong

[16-Feb-19 08:09 PM] TonyL#3577
I bet it thinking that any player starting as lvl1 warrior even if you reusing him

[16-Feb-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it show the proper level of character when you start?

[16-Feb-19 08:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do I use, bailout rpc ?

[16-Feb-19 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
In rogue game yes - in replay nope

[16-Feb-19 08:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist TUI will issue it automatically

[16-Feb-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! ok, investigating

[16-Feb-19 08:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I didn't pay much attention to such cases before because it's hard to check without replay - but now I think that if in warrior reusing game left dungeon with more than 12hp missing from maxhp amount it's counting as dead. Can play tomorrow to be totally sure

[16-Feb-19 08:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I did that then still 0 warriors when i checked

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Bailout transaction should be mined first to see warrior in list (you can check mempool status in TUI Utility)

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for confirmation

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL now you can extract keystrokes and replay you can verify if the replay is correct

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly if the replay is messed up, any sort of result is possible

[16-Feb-19 08:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Gotta extract all this from your brains so everyone else can figure it out.

[16-Feb-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the code seems like it should work the same for gameplay and replay...

[16-Feb-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe with many reusings of playerdata, something goes wrong

[16-Feb-19 08:17 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist üëç  I will add notification print after game finishing to TUI

[16-Feb-19 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c for this  second game actions on replay are correct (only not correct that I have lvl1 warrior since he was lvl7 and he had around 60max hp when on replay maxhp12) and in the end of replay warrior left with 10 hp - not dead

[16-Feb-19 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577

[16-Feb-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, the maxhp was limited to 12?!

Map situation is correct

[16-Feb-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
But he was lvl7 with ~50-60 maxhp

[16-Feb-19 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
And replay is ending on frame which I've shared above (and I'm totally sure that I quit dungeon with 9-10 hp)

[16-Feb-19 08:29 PM] TonyL#3577
But `alive: 0`

[16-Feb-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the replay is using standard char, but this is just the rogue dapp replay mode

[16-Feb-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the playerdata needs to be extracted and saved

[16-Feb-19 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577

we need to get the replay via dapp identical to replay in daemon to track this down. i added playerdata to extraction

[16-Feb-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Will it be in same .0 file or there is some separate one?

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%2222bfd60866bead58adedb3bd9e453d2f29964bfb29a2d73782f5e90199b08d8d6f%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]\"```` game with deadlock is this one

[16-Feb-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, that was a very fast game

[16-Feb-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i fixed the deadlock

[16-Feb-19 08:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, was quite fast - i've spawn with not much hp and a lot of of enemies around so tried to fight few moves without armor and weapon and then decided back to base for better roll

[16-Feb-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if the deadlock is fixed, are there any bugs?

[16-Feb-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
now rogue dapp replay appears sane

[16-Feb-19 08:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to bailout deadlocked warrior

[16-Feb-19 08:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Second bug (in my undestanding) is that:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%224dc60d3dc4c80ae0315cc750f3357bf132cde98f9d148e0a8106adf0adbf4ff0%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]\"```

[16-Feb-19 08:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Not dead counted as dead

[16-Feb-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt seem dead to me

[16-Feb-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But he didn't back to me and in game info `alive:0`

[16-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
