[21-Feb-19 12:19 PM] jeezy#3408
everytime I try to bailout the game txid  the daemon gets stuck

[21-Feb-19 12:25 PM] jeezy#3408

Why I not see in TOP 20?

[21-Feb-19 02:21 PM] figgy132#7531
has anyone noticed the wee bug in rogue_tui.py when you lose your warrior because you have tried to mount armor (W) before moving? game becomes unrepsonsive but lets you press ctrl+c which gives you the quit prompt - this lets you leave the game cleanly but warrior is gone (no kills or gold)

[21-Feb-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
@ciumete are you running daemon with pubkey?

[21-Feb-19 02:57 PM] Strob#3417
How can we see the specs of our warrior?

[21-Feb-19 02:58 PM] Strob#3417
When  we finish a game what happen with the gold? Can we see it somewhere or are just the top 20 saved?

[21-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Strob  it gets converted to ROGUE

[21-Feb-19 03:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
As far as specs, in the TUI you can "check warriors" [2] and it will list the warrior tokens

[21-Feb-19 03:12 PM] Strob#3417
Is there a rogue explorer?

What's the difference between playing in TUI or manually?

[21-Feb-19 03:23 PM] SHossain#0007
automatic and manual

[21-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Strob#3417
Any advantages to the manual?

[21-Feb-19 03:24 PM] SHossain#0007
not for end users unless you want to learn or build on it

[21-Feb-19 03:24 PM] Strob#3417
ok thanks SHossain!

[21-Feb-19 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
TUI doesn't require you to remember commands and use them manually. everything is wrapped under the hood with easy to use menu options.

It is @siu - Chainmakers

[21-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Its well known as being super super hard, imagine not starting over with a saved warrior.

[21-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The classic version is the hardest (this version) 2 or 3 versions later devs started adding a save feature

on bailout @nael55  or on start ?

[21-Feb-19 04:26 PM] nael55#5863
on start, but possibly bailout too. had to restart comp and don't remember if bailout was succcessful

[21-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Hmmm. I don't know about on start problems.

[21-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So you're using the TUI and it quits after a certain amount of time?

[21-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Did you start the chain/daemon after restart?

[21-Feb-19 04:31 PM] nael55#5863
yes using tui. it doesn't quit, just hangs on "waiting for game tx to be mined"

[21-Feb-19 04:31 PM] nael55#5863
yes daemon started

[21-Feb-19 04:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
