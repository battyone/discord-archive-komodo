@TonyL Where can i download the rogue wallet?

[22-Feb-19 09:41 PM] TonyL#3577
There is no any GUI wallet for ROGUE at the moment, you can operate your balance via cli of komodo daemon

[22-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Petrus#8039
is there a guide or something similar to that?

[22-Feb-19 09:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure!  https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game please check this one

@Gordon Komodo Hmm tested this daemon on Win10 only, maybe it's OS version related issue. Is there any scary errors in %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Komodo\ROGUE\debug.log ?

[22-Feb-19 09:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
want me to send you the debug.log?

[22-Feb-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577

@wookie  did you try the one in the guide?

My player 'Captain Kirk is Dead' just died, yet I relaunched him via TUI. Is this normal. I thought they were gone once dead.

[23-Feb-19 02:38 AM] wookie#7663
@Cryptofist yes. I had got it going a few days back and had been playing. I was working with tonyL today on a latest build that potentially was going to fix some of the issues about losing saved warriors.

[23-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504

Hi I'm working on adding the "What is proof of Gameplay?" section  to the ANN now.
``what rogue CC uses is the actual gameplay keystrokes, it is pretty direct and literal proof of gameplay``
What does RogueCC use the gameplay keystrokes for specifically? Any other tidbits that should go here to inform users of PoG ?

[23-Feb-19 05:46 AM] gcharang#6833
RogueCC rewards coins for submitting verifiable proof of game play with some limitations. like dead characters don't get ROGUE etc.,

[23-Feb-19 05:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Thank you @gcharang , I had "uses the keystrokes to convert game gold to ROGUE" but didnt think that was right, this helps a lot thank you!

[23-Feb-19 05:47 AM] gt#2812
i was under the impression that ‚Äúproof of gameplay‚Äù is showing that you‚Äôve put in time (via playing via keystrokes etc) to be rewarded with gold which can than be exchanged for rogue coins

[23-Feb-19 05:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
``Rogue CC rewards ROGUE to players by verifying the gameplay keystrokes, it quite literally is Proof of Gameplay. ``

[23-Feb-19 05:50 AM] gcharang#6833
And that happens when a character bailsout or wins, gold collected is converted to ROGUE in a pre-determined ratio for different modes

[23-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
On bailout (quiting while alive) the game automataically converts your in game gold to ROGUE

[23-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Now that part I DO know. üòÉ

[23-Feb-19 05:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I have some of the rates on the ANN,  I will be adding as much detailed info as I can to that over the next few weeks.

Well bedtime for me, good luck. Hopefully we can find out why that happens soon!

[23-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
for now since game validation is only 90% and not 100%,   i made it so zombies are allowed. the dead can be ressurrected. not sure if this will remain this way, but without it people were losing valid players with lots of time put in

[23-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if the daemon is dead, nothing will work, that should be no surprise and it can be any sort of error

[23-Feb-19 06:52 AM] Strob#3417
Question when you make changes to rogue do we have to recompile something?

[23-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is a consensus changing change, then yes

[23-Feb-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
during the early days, it happens a lot, once its stable then it will be stable

ROGUE started on node that was having `make` trouble.  Stuck on block 196.  Will try again.

[23-Feb-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
196 means you didnt include the rogue libcc.so

[23-Feb-19 02:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh.. thanks

[23-Feb-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810

if you dont have the rogue "plugin", you cant connect properly to the ROGUE network
