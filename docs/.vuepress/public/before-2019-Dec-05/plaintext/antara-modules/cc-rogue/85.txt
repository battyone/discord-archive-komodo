Oh multiplayer

[07-Mar-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to apply all latest fixes to it

[07-Mar-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And re-test

[07-Mar-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Will focus now on multiplayer part of TUI enchacing + mutliplayer testing so (have to refactor part of code I think to re-use in both single and multiplayer). And will wait for a feedback about singleplayer

I'm waiting now for a next block long too

[07-Mar-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's related

[07-Mar-19 09:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to wait a little bit more

[07-Mar-19 09:22 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay. Thanks.

[07-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Also you may to find keystrokes for this game by `cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid` and check if last keystroketxid on blockhain

[07-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Also interesting what `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getrawtransaction lastkeystroketxid 1 ` will return

[07-Mar-19 09:28 AM] ronyi#5719
If i starting multiple new game with new warrior at the same time, I get the same level.

[07-Mar-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, first level should be the same

[07-Mar-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Next levels should be different

[07-Mar-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Was this case with 'confirmations' print resolved ?

[07-Mar-19 09:32 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but i'm a little bit sad, i killed my old rare warrior, but this was my fault. 😄 luckily everything worked fine

[07-Mar-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so you just waited at it passed to bailout?

[07-Mar-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm sorry about your warrior 😦

[07-Mar-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Good if it worked - I was aftaid already that have to check in tui keystrokes rebroadcaster not only if there is error but also if it on blockchain actually 😃

[07-Mar-19 09:34 AM] ronyi#5719
I just waited and bailout worked good.

👍 

[07-Mar-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
`If i starting multiple new game `  - please note that multiplayer games don't have any TUI fixes yet (waiting for different transactions confirmations and etc) so progress of most of the games should be lost

[07-Mar-19 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Not recommend to use valuable warriors - I'll work on mutliplayer patching now

[07-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Later in stable version I can hide these printouts "waiting for this, waiting for that" or change to some funny text but now it's helpful to troubleshoot

Aha it's like a last keystroke wasn't broadcasted

[07-Mar-19 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you check in separate window in keystrokes.log if there any error?

[07-Mar-19 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it'll be broadcasted in some time

[07-Mar-19 09:59 AM] ronyi#5719
yes

[07-Mar-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
But no transaction on blockchain

[07-Mar-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I think I know how to solve it - will just rebroadcast last keystroke in case of any error this scanner see until it get `confirmations` key

[07-Mar-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to keep broadcasting until it confirms

[07-Mar-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Will add it a little bit later - now totally lost in my spagetthis  for multiplayer games

🙌 

[07-Mar-19 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just a thought regards multiplayer: 
Since atm is possible to start multiplayer game when room not totally filled - is it possible to scan games list to find games where `alive: 0` but still free spaces to join and then just join and highlander to take everyones buyins?

[07-Mar-19 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha here is the answer!
```Do you want to make bailout now [y] or wait for one more block [n]? [y/n]: y
{'name': 'rogue', 'method': 'highlander', 'myrogueaddr': 'RVuzXY65FyJiPPWSBc9efATh6nb4M9MceR', 'gametxid': '0eb9aa41200f575018645aabeb03cc7f706199d3d3164906a450fa822863617d', 'status': 'error', 'error': 'numplayers != maxplayers'}
```

[07-Mar-19 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
`'error': 'numplayers != maxplayers'` can't leave not full game

[07-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
cant highlander a not full game

[07-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
you can bailout

[07-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the tricky case with likely bugs are when there are open slots but its expired as it is too late

[07-Mar-19 10:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, I have pretty dumb check: If alive > 1 => bailout, if alive == 1 => highlander

[07-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i have code to try to determine all the possible variations, but doubt I got them all right

[07-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but if one spot was never registered, it wont be alive

[07-Mar-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe the highlander rpc will return that error for such cases

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe give seed to players only when room filled?

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
seed is only after 5 blocks

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
late arrivals can register for up to 60 blocks later

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
or can close registration at the 5 blocks

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think I was able to start game less than in 5 blocks

[07-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me re-check

[07-Mar-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
there should be no seed before 5 blocks as it uses the blockhash from 5 blocks in the future

[07-Mar-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it works correct. I even had check for it Oo
```        if if_ready_to_start:                                                             
            print(colorize("Ready for start!", "green"))                                  
        else:                                                                             
            print(colorize("Not ready for start yet, wait until start height!", "red"))   ```

[07-Mar-19 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c All multiplayer games I'm creating now starting from same room

[07-Mar-19 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
It's creating / starting in different blocks with quite huge block difference

[07-Mar-19 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
It's Emu in same room with me, than if go right there is hobgoblin

[07-Mar-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI now should work in multiplayer (at least in some cases) but needs to be tested more

[07-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
what seed?

[07-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the rogue dapp actually has no idea it is a multiplayer game

{Reactions}
👌 

[07-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a different seed for a single player game as far as the rogue dapp is concerned

[07-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe im passing something not correct as a seed hmm - will research, now not with PC

[07-Mar-19 02:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm @jl777c  this error I got when using migrates with far too many inputs, the transaction was too large it seems, and it caused some overflow which results in the validation thinking vout is negative, when infact its not when you decode raw transaction.

[07-Mar-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it was a temporary issue as the manual bailout worked

[07-Mar-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
According to screenshot it is error on last keystroke rebroadcast attempt so it shouldn't affect manual bailout (maybe it was just made without last keystroke progress)

[07-Mar-19 05:30 PM] wookie#7663
@TonyL with the latest 0.2.1b version, I get the tui to run, but when trying to start the game, I get this error: 
Something went wrong.
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'cc/rogue/rogue': 'cc/rogue/rogue'

I exited and ran the previous 0.2 version and the game starts just fine.

[07-Mar-19 05:41 PM] ronyi#5719

There  is no `Qy` in replay but last frame just "frozen by ice monster", not moment of death

[07-Mar-19 10:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe only death when hp  == 0 tracking, not by hypothermia. Hmm but in replay you have 288 gold as in extract, interesting why ``` 260 Testelek:``` rogue counted as 260

[07-Mar-19 10:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Can be counted as random game moment I wonder - maybe this dude got hot blood 😂

``` both players have status finished now 
I'm not totally sure how I can handle such cases from TUI

[07-Mar-19 11:08 PM] TonyL#3577
To decide bailout or highlander I'm checking first what `gameinfo` alive key return: 
- if it's > 1 I'm trying to do bailout, if bailout attempt returned error - trying to do highlander (maybe game state changed since gameinfo response let's say)
- if it's 1 - trying to do highlander. Only if room not full ```highlander_info["error"] == 'numplayers != maxplayers'``` doing bailout instead

[07-Mar-19 11:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Also I think multiplayer not enjoyable at all from TUI atm because player can't see current game state (how many players alive) to decide can he quit already to take buyins or not.

And tbh current winner decision seems not interesting imo. Games might be super long - somebody can just die on lvl1 and not make bailout for hour
