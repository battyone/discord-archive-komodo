It's around 10 hours of pure gameplay to create such I wonder

[25-Mar-19 09:28 PM] ronyi#5719
Thanks, but not need it. Building more warriors, i love rogue and i think is good, we playing for the game experience.

[25-Mar-19 09:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, we playing to catch bugs ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Mar-19 09:29 PM] ronyi#5719
what about us without bugs? ðŸ˜„

[25-Mar-19 09:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Will play some other new game which will have bugs ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Mar-19 09:30 PM] ronyi#5719
Good plan. ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Mar-19 09:33 PM] TonyL#3577
With #cc-games power I wonder there will be many games to play soon

[25-Mar-19 09:35 PM] TonyL#3577
If I understand correct It's kinda framework based on rogue blockchain interaction groundwork and mechanics (roguechanics? ðŸ˜ƒ )

[25-Mar-19 09:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Or connection point for games better to say maybe

[25-Mar-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i got most all the rogue equivalent functions ported, but they are untested

[25-Mar-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
right now I am integrating the user event broadcasting so we get realtime keystrokes events to prevent cheating by not broadcasting keystrokes

[25-Mar-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it also allows to do keystrokes tx just at the end

[25-Mar-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh there should be solution for our current problem I bet (in realtime broadcasting maybe) ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Mar-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Mar-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but realtime broadcasting will be swiss cheese at each node

[25-Mar-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
no single node would be guaranteed to have all events

[25-Mar-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but the node cant really afford to cheat as any event likely is on some other node and if you cheat you lose your gold and player

[25-Mar-19 09:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it sounds like a p2p gaming consensus

[25-Mar-19 09:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool things coming ðŸ˜ƒ

[25-Mar-19 09:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Will it have "customazible" keystrokes reader?

[25-Mar-19 09:42 PM] TonyL#3577
So can pre-set if keystroke `c` it's call if `f` it's fold and so on

[25-Mar-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that is all game specific. I just got it so tetris events are broadcast in realtime

[25-Mar-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
makegames and then maketetris, run ./tetris. your node will spew out realtime keystrokes

[25-Mar-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is almost 1:1 of the rogue rpc, you can test the initial ones like create (newgame), list, games, register, etc

[25-Mar-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not finish as the tetris dapp just got the realtime broadcasts and it took 3500 lines today to get this far

[25-Mar-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
basically all the rpc calls that dont involve playing should be working

[25-Mar-19 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
chain name is GTEST

[25-Mar-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_name=GTEST -ac_cclib=gamescc -ac_supply=1000000 -pubkey=<pubkey> -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=2  &

[25-Mar-19 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
updated the rpc calls to match rogue almost exactly, i wanted to make it as easy as possible to make a games TUI. the only difference is there is no bailout/highlander, but just finish. though maybe this will change. the actual gameplay not being there makes it hard to know ahead of time

{Reactions}
ðŸ”¥ 

[25-Mar-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so other than the bailout/highlander the rogue TUI could just work as it is. the evalcode also matches as it is 17

with immortal chars, it seems we can go to levels never achieved before

[26-Mar-19 08:44 AM] ronyi#5719
How many levels we have? I quit on lvl 34 now and waiting for bailout.

[26-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
probably we need to limit the level multiplier

[26-Mar-19 09:02 AM] ronyi#5719
i think yes, or somehow maximalize how many rogue in one game.

[26-Mar-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the deepest level you went to?

[26-Mar-19 09:04 AM] ronyi#5719
This was that lvl. 34, but i think possible with this warrior is the game limit. D it doesn't hurt.....

[26-Mar-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
game has no limit

[26-Mar-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 2 billion levels

[26-Mar-19 09:05 AM] ronyi#5719
it would be just a long game ðŸ˜„

[26-Mar-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what should the max per game limit be?

[26-Mar-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
I can set the max dungeonlevel in the cashout calc to anything

[26-Mar-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe I will set it to 42

[26-Mar-19 09:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay, but with "immortal" warrior very easy the reach max. lvl. it only depends on the time of the player.

[26-Mar-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
how much ROGUE does a normal get the amulet and come back out game generate?

[26-Mar-19 09:09 AM] ronyi#5719
~700-1300 lvl. 1-26 up and down

[26-Mar-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and a lot of the rewards are for the magic items, which doesnt seem right you get it over and over, so what about a 777 ROGUE cashout cap

[26-Mar-19 09:11 AM] ronyi#5719
I think good, we want community value.

[26-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, as of height 77777 777 will be the max ROGUE per game

[26-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also dungeonlevel > 42 will just multiply as 42

[26-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
please dont go past level 42 until height 77777

It's Ubuntu and latest jl777

[26-Mar-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
are those big payout games?

[26-Mar-19 11:10 AM] ronyi#5719
I builded the lastest jl777 on ubuntu and working good for me.

[26-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I stuck this way on reindex - now trying to sync from total scratch with blocks deletion

[26-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi You've tried to sync from scratch and it worked fine?

Sorry i don't know what is the scratch, but i stopped rouge node and used this simple command:
cd ~/komodo
git checkout jl777
git pull
make clean
cd src
rm komodod komodo-cli komodo-tx *.so
cd cc
rm *.so
cd rogue
make clean
cd ../../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
and started the daemon.

[26-Mar-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh started syncing

[26-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's some node which stuck on 69521 as well ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Mar-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
And other ones in print are block generation transactions as well

[26-Mar-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
But it have height significally less than 69521 - so maybe these prints not related to chain stuck

[26-Mar-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh new peers gave me new chain state and bigger longestchain - just few nodes I'm connected to stuck on 69521

[26-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
`159.69.19.131`

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/KKC8mJYSYK/ full print I have on stuck @jl777c

[26-Mar-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
It's somehow connected to what happened on wookies side it seems

[26-Mar-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
By some reason players inventory printed for me in stdout on sync

[26-Mar-19 11:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it's happened because of some legacy warriors reusage

[26-Mar-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i make it print mismatched playerdata, that is illegal, is it on the mainchain?

[26-Mar-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the difference in pack

[26-Mar-19 11:48 AM] TonyL#3577
1: 10  q* s dsjdsjq* a hhhkhhhhhhhhhhhhh h hhhhhkkkhhhh s

[26-Mar-19 11:48 AM] TonyL#3577
items with keystrokes in itemname

[26-Mar-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly illegal

[26-Mar-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but is that txid somehow on the mainchain?

[26-Mar-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, the mainchain is wrong

[26-Mar-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
There was a bug few weeks ago when was possible to create such items, let me check these txs on node with full chain

[26-Mar-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`strength.31/0`oh and also they have max strength 0

[26-Mar-19 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure how to check these corrupted inventory players txs on mainchain - there is no playertxid in stdout

[26-Mar-19 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
But there are more prints before it stuck:

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens on extract of that game

`c4f1f3aca7fb613c1a6c467490c1a0c5c4d143043e35a115d32c4d36bd07d070` on mainchain as well

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, it could have been the data corruption bug from a while back

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
resync rejects it, so that seems correct

[26-Mar-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and the real chain is the one that rejects it

[26-Mar-19 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577

` extract worked fine

[26-Mar-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so is the bailout tx for that game the valid playerdata or invalid playerdata
