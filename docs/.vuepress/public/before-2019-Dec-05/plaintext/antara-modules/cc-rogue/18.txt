[14-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Pumtchak#0362
i played two games

[14-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Pumtchak#0362
the first one you give me the command to bailout manually (posted above)

[14-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Pumtchak#0362
the second i did it myself

[14-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Pumtchak#0362
with the good gametxid

[14-Feb-19 07:52 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 \"[%22c58efc9dd3850926c2f9429ae5846d59630eb47c184d99b4e79c3cfa575b51b5%22]\"```

This player participated

[14-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Pumtchak#0362
yep

[14-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Pumtchak#0362
but player info is not correct

[14-Feb-19 07:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess it's info state when you started this game

[14-Feb-19 07:53 PM] TonyL#3577
```"alive": 0,``` and seems he isn't alive now üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 07:53 PM] Pumtchak#0362
i was level 9 when i bailout (or died)

[14-Feb-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe here is a bug?

[14-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
always possible

[14-Feb-19 07:54 PM] Pumtchak#0362
no i think i just died üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
can it be duplicated

[14-Feb-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
oh dying is easy to duplicate

[14-Feb-19 07:55 PM] Pumtchak#0362
i'll try to watch it next time üòâ

whereever you are ^^

[14-Feb-19 07:56 PM] TonyL#3577
@Pumtchak advice you to update TUI (git pull and copy files to src again). It's now waiting for one block before bailout so less likely any data before quit will be lost

[14-Feb-19 07:58 PM] TonyL#3577
I will add menu tomorrow also to check unfinished games list and manually issue bailout by game txid specifying. Oh, and also warrior name setting feature will be added üòÉ

0.0.3 will be with multiplayer so üòÉ

[14-Feb-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be a version for @ca333 and we can put a high score contest with that version

{Reactions}
üëç 

[14-Feb-19 08:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Highscore contest actually possible to make with singleplayer one
Multiplayer have natural way to compete by "room" buyin

[14-Feb-19 08:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean to start a contest after the next version

[14-Feb-19 08:42 PM] SHossain#0007
when we have more resources and source is more stable (it is already stable as of now)

[14-Feb-19 08:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's better to test more for sure + make it cross-platform üòÉ 
Btw would be insteresting to add option for freerolls creation @jl777c When there is prize in multiplayer game but players no need to buyin (game prize funding by game creator)
Nice way to bring attraction for multiplayer battles on early stages and grind some ROGUE in PVP clashes

[14-Feb-19 09:23 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What does Type Error: must be str, not dict mean ? I died and cannot start a new game with tui

[14-Feb-19 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577

Please update komodod daemon (pull latest jl777 branch, rebuild and restart)

[14-Feb-19 09:34 PM] TonyL#3577
James made a change in `players 17` RPC call and added `playersinfo` but your daemon is without these changes, so TUI receiving full info about player where only player id is expected

[14-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Alright#0419
is there validation code for ROGUE yet?

[14-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL is vin/vout structure for each tx type documented somewhere?

[14-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
found it, nevermind

[15-Feb-19 05:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`cclib newgame maxplayers buyin`

[15-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is the meaning of `buyin` in this command?

[15-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see the example says `[3,10]`

[15-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Understand that 3 is multiple palyer

[15-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
10 is confusing

[15-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can someone please clear?

[15-Feb-19 05:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Buy-in to multiplayer game: maxplayers players compete - last survival or player who complete the game first taking all buyins

[15-Feb-19 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, how does 10 fit in this explanation?

[15-Feb-19 05:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Each player will need to pay 10 coins to start the game, so if there are 3 players prize pool will be 30 coins in total

[15-Feb-19 05:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh!! that clears! üòÉ

Hmm just thinking - Heroes of Might and Magic on blockchain should be possible
https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi there is some opensourced engine written on C++ 
https://github.com/ciplogic/fheroes2enh - opensourced second heroes engine

And step by step mechanics should allow to do it similar to rogue way

[15-Feb-19 06:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool, got output

[15-Feb-19 06:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which players it shows?

[15-Feb-19 06:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Playertxid of saved warriors which you have (when you do bailout for game where your warrior is not dead your warrior state saving) will be in playerdata list

[15-Feb-19 06:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Then you can check detailed info about warrior by `cclib playerinfo 17 [%22playertxid%22]`

[15-Feb-19 06:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh since I haven't played and crossed level 1, I don't have any players showing....

[15-Feb-19 06:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct?

[15-Feb-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Since you not executed bailout for game with alive warrior. 
In general it's possible to save warrior from level1 as well. You just need to play a little, wait until some keystrokes mined, press `Shift + q, y` to quit the game, then broadcast `cclib bailout 17 [%22gametxid%22]`

If your warrior was alive when you did bailout you'll see its playertxid in `playerdata` after bailout tx is mined

In general you can check TUI codedump from this line https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/lib/tuilib.py#L944 till the end it's ROGUE TUI code
Sequence of RPC calls may clear some moments maybe

@Crabby Paddy Cryptokitties in top loool

[15-Feb-19 06:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
have to play the game to make API data üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 06:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was trying to avoid playing and coding the go code üòÑ

[15-Feb-19 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 tonyl
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt get name"
}
```
I've not set any name before and all my warriors are freds. @jl777c Am I doing something wrong?

[15-Feb-19 06:44 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder not sure how it's possible to wrap head over something without trying it üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 06:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree on that

[15-Feb-19 06:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all I needed the JSON data to just setup the go methods, and then put conditions as I play etc

[15-Feb-19 06:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I played a game, was about to be killed, then I quit the game

[15-Feb-19 06:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now I need to execute bailout command to show players call showing that array value?

[15-Feb-19 06:50 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 \"[%22tonyl%22]\"
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "success",
  "name": "tonyl"
}``` setname worked like this 
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue_rpc.cpp#L1101 it just receiving array with args as others methods
