Oh it would be much more easier with possibility to watch replay keystroke by keystroke

[18-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
just slowdown the replay

[18-Mar-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in rogue.c

[18-Mar-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a sleeptime*1000 or something like that

[18-Mar-19 05:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok

[18-Mar-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
make it a bigger number

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if you add logging at the end of command() in commands.c, basically a copy paste of the io.c logging code (using a different name than "log")

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can see the keystrokes

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577

```
extracted keystrokes and local keystrokes on player side match 100%

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ch is the command

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is not a keystrokes tx problem!

[18-Mar-19 05:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so it's clear now how to determine this non-det - will try to find it out now

[18-Mar-19 05:51 PM] ronyi#5719
I played another game(lvl1-6) without problem. I think i playing one more almost sure....bug.

[18-Mar-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
plz confirm this! alternative good/bad is quite unlikely, but not impossible as anything is possible

[18-Mar-19 05:59 PM] ronyi#5719
I sent my keystrokes files to TonyL. Checked on my side: 71ae5a81375f07e495bc4138830efdb6  817135201493258637_combined.txt

[18-Mar-19 06:01 PM] TonyL#3577
In replay things starting to go out of sync after defeating of  non existing `kestrel`

[18-Mar-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
This fight with `kestrel` presists in replay but not presists in actual game, then in replay he go back to top right room to pickup dropped armor - but actually he never do that

[18-Mar-19 06:04 PM] TonyL#3577
There are no scrolls, no potions - just armor drop and pickup - then movement to left room. In replay there is a fight with `kestrel` in hall, in actual game he just moved and actually fighted with `kestrel` but a little bit later in other map place (in other hall)

[18-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TonyL#3577
After this fight with non-existing kestrel things starting to go wrong

[18-Mar-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a coordinates missmatch

[18-Mar-19 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
In extracted replay fight is in ellipse hall, in actual game in rectangle one
Then in extracted replay warrior back to pickup armor to the right direction, but in actual game he went into rectangle zone and fighted here, than back without armor picking up

[18-Mar-19 06:10 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe this non-det even is connected with monsters spawn

[18-Mar-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
seems so. out of curiosity are the length of the 2 hallways the same? did the K appear in the same place in each?

[18-Mar-19 06:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it interesting to check

[18-Mar-19 06:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Length not the same

[18-Mar-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577
```##############

[18-Mar-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Hall where original fight happened is longer :troll_compadre:

[18-Mar-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Ahaa thats match with my previous finding about fight as well (second game with progress losing interrupting after fight with kestrel. By interruption I mean moment when gold progress stops to count) - problem is monsters in non expected places ohh

[18-Mar-19 06:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I hope rogue don't have some troll code like a "random monsters generating in halls"

[18-Mar-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it uses the normal RNG it can have that

[18-Mar-19 06:21 PM] TonyL#3577
normal means pseudo one?

[18-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the standard way it gets a new random number everywhere in the code

[18-Mar-19 06:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Sorry, just don't know which events generating from block entropy

[18-Mar-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
So if monster appeared in non predicted place - it means that seed changed by some reason I wonder, last things which warrior did is pickup / drop armor

[18-Mar-19 06:24 PM] TonyL#3577
When armor creating by in-game RNG determining if it cursed (or maybe on pickup stage - not sure)

[18-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
each RNG calc updates seed

[18-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the only external setting of seed is at the beginning

[18-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
user actions determine what RNG to calc

[18-Mar-19 06:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Ohh, I'm out of ideas sorry

[18-Mar-19 06:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Will compare now video and extracted replay for previous game - maybe will catch something in it

[18-Mar-19 06:37 PM] ronyi#5719

[18-Mar-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it could be some state variable. try playing games with a ROGUE chain restart before each one

[18-Mar-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i assume the first game after starting ROGUE works, then it doesnt work, then it works, ...

Okay, tomorrow morning....

@TonyL on the new bundle, executing the command for the previous bailout gave me this error on the daemon window:

I also played a game last night with exactly the same issue as this one, do you want that too?

[18-Mar-19 07:08 PM] TonyL#3577
I think one case is enough for now. Is same behaviour is `negativevout` print in debug.log on bailout sending?

[18-Mar-19 07:09 PM] wookie#7663
yes, exactly the same printouts.

[18-Mar-19 07:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Just finished watching other corrupted game ronyis replay - case is same: fight in non expected place, then everything goes wrong in replay. Will try to play on my side with and without daemon restart

[18-Mar-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm playing games meanwhile. Played the first with fresh warrior - exited on level4 and progress fully saved. Will start second now

[18-Mar-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
what are the values of the vins for that mismatched tx?

[18-Mar-19 07:37 PM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Mbp58QCHNK/ all vins - is it normal that `value` not printing for vins in decoderawtransaction?

[18-Mar-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
they arent printed until spent

[18-Mar-19 07:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, need to make script to count so

[18-Mar-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its ok, I think I pushed fix

[18-Mar-19 07:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok 👍 Will build fresh on OSX now to check on wookie's side

[18-Mar-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it was a very edge case, where 1/(maxinputs+1) * maxinputs ended up too small

game state fix will require confirmation that restarting ROGUE daemon before each game does fix things

[18-Mar-19 07:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, testing it atm

[18-Mar-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810

And try to bailout then

[18-Mar-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, also daemon from archive should be placed to bundle folder (just replace current daemon files) - otherwise it will not find rogue if you'll try to play with it

So can't reproduce on my side, maybe it's realted to itemization/gameplay style - let's say ronyi using rings as  I know but I dont have any

[18-Mar-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, ronyi is advanced player and must be doing something rarely

[18-Mar-19 08:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's wait for ronyi expertise so. Maybe he can try to play without rings lets say or not use some jedi-tricks in a few games to compare extraction. Or if daemon restart will help will be really easier to `move all possible state that isnt cleared into globals`

[18-Mar-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, first is for him to do exactly the same just a restart of daemon before every game. it that makes things reliable, then it is some internal state. i am not thinking this is very likely as the internal replay happens N times and each time it is the same. if there was something specific to initial time, it wouldnt always extract the same. still we need to eliminate this. then it would be some advanced gameplay method that causes the non-det
