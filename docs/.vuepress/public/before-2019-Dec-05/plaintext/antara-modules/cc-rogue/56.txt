Update TUI from `rogue` branch - it's trying to broadcast bailout until success now

[20-Feb-19 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
You  still can finish game manually by ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"```

though the outputs are shaped for unix-like

[20-Feb-19 09:54 PM] TonyL#3577
It can't call `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 \"[%229a060384eed8bbb4a915ea691027f9b2d4e8f8f17516b0a785883a4080653cfc%22]\"` because on windows it's something like a .\komodo-cli.exe

use the following if you don't have any funds in your wallet
```
cd /Library/Application\ Support/komodo
rm -rf ROGUE
```
and start the chain again to sync from scratch fully

@TonyL yes exactly. i have already told shossain: the sys() call for komodo-cli needs to be "winyfied" and a tiny gameplay fix (win specific) needs to be pushed. Expect this in the coming hours. I just got a high priority task to resolve.

Very important to know: jump [nojump]
     If this option is set, running moves will not  be  dis-
     played until you reach the end of the move.  This saves
     considerable  cpu  and  display  time.    This   option
     defaults to jump if you are using a slow terminal.
