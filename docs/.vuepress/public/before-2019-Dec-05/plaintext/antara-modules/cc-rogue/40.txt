Cool!

[18-Feb-19 09:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
how long til multiplayer testing starts?

[18-Feb-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been ready for testing for a week

[18-Feb-19 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
If this bug is resolved - I'll try few short and few long games, check if progress saving correct and proceed to multiplayer testing and implementation in TUI

[18-Feb-19 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I have some multiplayer code prepared already so probably will not take long for some "work at least once" version - probably tonight or tomorrow

[18-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
@actionslacks DEX features were implemented in TUI but I've not received any feedback so far - you may start from this one if you want to contribute

[18-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
```DEX features:

[6] Check if somebody wants to buy your warrior (incoming bids)
[7] Place order to sell warrior
[8] Place order to buy someones warrior
[9] Check if somebody selling warrior
[10] Check / cancel my warriors trade orders```

[18-Feb-19 09:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
ok, still setting up a new box, should be ready to jump in soon.

But seems it saved progress after both Q+n and potion quaff

[18-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And these prints `Got 'Q' next (n)` not disappear in game until you use inventory to cover by other print - but I guess it's for debug reasons here

As I know so far there are now maxstrength decreasing effects in game (only maxstrength increasing potions) so it cant be less than 16

I have way more than 23 items in pack now

If I drop let's say `potion of levitation` now - I can't pick it up back with print that no space

[18-Feb-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to determine this bug and describe way of reproducing

[18-Feb-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it is due to my nitems hack

[18-Feb-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but how did you get so much in your pack?

[18-Feb-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Feb-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you must have picked it up

[18-Feb-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
fixing the 12 strength limit, must have gotten the compare direction wring

[18-Feb-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
There are some strange combinations when I have no space, then drop one and able to pick up two

[18-Feb-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to clearly detect

[18-Feb-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
strength compare seems good, will just removeit

[18-Feb-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe code thinking now that one inventory menu item = one inventory item

[18-Feb-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577

Got it. I can pick up more when I'm erase inventory menu item

[18-Feb-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
how do you erase menu item?

[18-Feb-19 10:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a when have same two scrolls - if drop one scroll  can't pickup

[18-Feb-19 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
But if drop scroll (or other item) of which I have only 1 instance - i can pickup

[18-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i fixed the problem

[18-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
before it was counting things that are in the pack and also not in the pack as using a spot

[18-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I think the original game maybe counted things in a different way, but the way it is now, it seems you can really load up a playerdata

[18-Feb-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if this destroys the gameplay, I can change back to how the game originally allowed pack items

[18-Feb-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Feb-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577

Pinned a message.

[18-Feb-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
But some items stacked (like a 9 item of food). You made a fix with such idea? Just want to double-check while I'm in this state

[18-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it should work fine. just counting the inventory letters

[18-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
before it didnt check if it was in inventory!

[18-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Inventory letters != items

[18-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
a) 9 rations of food
9 items but 1 letter

[18-Feb-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it allow me to have 23 inventory letters but I can have as much items as I want if it not taking more than 23 letters

[18-Feb-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, let me try the fixed version and check how it behaviour now

[18-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
some interim versions might get validate errors. I will update FSM with current version seems pretty stable

[18-Feb-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
current jl777 merged to FSM. jl777 will be unstable for a while

[18-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Feb-19 11:33 AM] TonyL#3577
I  only can not pickup if item will create new letter (because there is 23 letters max limit I wonder)

[18-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
but letters != items amount, so I wonder code should check that items amount < 23 rather than letters amount

[18-Feb-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I can collect 100 food now or 100 same scrolls what is not the same as in original rogue

[18-Feb-19 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe especially this warrior is corrupted for sure, because his inventory was filled on previous version
 will try to fill new warrior inventory now

[18-Feb-19 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577

removed that print from FSM branch

[18-Feb-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as inventory goes are you sure originally rogue did not allow stacking of items?

[18-Feb-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the code, it sure looks like stacking of items is allowed

[18-Feb-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
like 26 arrows

[18-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
It allowed to stack but not allowed to have more than 23 items in total

[18-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Not letters, items

[18-Feb-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
arrows?

[18-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Arrows worked special way

[18-Feb-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so weapons like arrows, daggers, shurikan is ok to have many

[18-Feb-19 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Stack with which you starting counted as 1 item

[18-Feb-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
everything else counted as 1

[18-Feb-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
thinking about the playerdata and collectibles market... maybe having a character with 100 food and 100 healing potions is not so bad, but I guess it does need to have some reasonable cap, so I will count total items also and we can decide what the limit should be

[18-Feb-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Warrior should a have huge cart with him to move with all this stuff in dungeon üòÇ

[18-Feb-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Would be interesting if max amount of items you can carry scale from strength

[18-Feb-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's game dev already...

[18-Feb-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
And if somehow possible to put arrows back to pack with arrows

[18-Feb-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
It would be wounderful

[18-Feb-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a I have pack with 30 arrows - why if I miss, pickup arrow I can't put it back to pack and single arrow taking one letter

[18-Feb-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
It's by original rogue design

[18-Feb-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
they are not pristine anymore and dont stack up perfectly?

In original rogue throwable items works this strange way - it's not related to your changes

So if I have 30 arrows on start I can just shoot to wall and fill inventory by picking up arrows because each arrow will take inventory slot
