I had only one node be able to continue past that since Sunday.  Got another up yesterday.

[27-Mar-19 02:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Been mining  some blocks.

[27-Mar-19 02:18 AM] CrisF#3405
At one point (Monday?) I got one node past that block, but it found another fork further up the chain.

[27-Mar-19 02:18 AM] CrisF#3405
It got stuck again on `69521`on re-sync.

[27-Mar-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is forked there. 69521 is the actual mainchain from what I can tell

[27-Mar-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for build problem

[27-Mar-19 08:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Building fine

[27-Mar-19 08:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Stuck there now:
```  "blocks": 74312,
  "longestchain": 76000```

[27-Mar-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
chain is messed up, not sure why

[27-Mar-19 08:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe becuase there are not so much peers - and key nodes updated on some version with additional validations, but big part or even majority used daemon from bundles

[27-Mar-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Mar-19 08:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm wanted to test multiplayer but can't sync to longest chain atm :/

[27-Mar-19 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
even with -connect?

[27-Mar-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
I dont have any healthy node right now

[27-Mar-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to connect only `5.9.102.210`

[27-Mar-19 08:42 PM] TonyL#3577
5.9.102.210 refusing connection

[27-Mar-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810

[27-Mar-19 08:59 PM] TonyL#3577
From `136.243.58.134 ` sync started - maybe will be lucky this time 😃

[28-Mar-19 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so i broke it recently... maybe use the 3 day old commit for now, i will investigate later.

[28-Mar-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with latest version full resync works

[28-Mar-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i did add an exemption to 69522

[28-Mar-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
that probably allowed things to sync to mainchain

Unfortunately seems that it not helped

[28-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
did you do a reconsider block for 69522?

[28-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a specific exemption for that gametxid

[28-Mar-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
I started with -reindex flag, now deleted all blockchain and started sync again

[28-Mar-19 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
reconsider 69521 I've tried also

[28-Mar-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, can't pass trough 69521

[28-Mar-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i see

[28-Mar-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
actually no, you must not be running ll777

[28-Mar-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 latest

[28-Mar-19 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm pretty sure that have latest daemon (because at first I had daemon with games cclib, then pull and rebuild with rogue cclib and cclib changed in cclibinfo output)

[28-Mar-19 03:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Now building daemon in other directory and deleted `~/.komodo/ROGUE` folder

[28-Mar-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i specifically exempt 2a34b36cc1292aecfaabdad79b42cab9989fa6dcc87ac8ca88aa6162dab1e2c4 from validation

[28-Mar-19 03:19 PM] TonyL#3577

    Merge pull request #1364 from tonymorony/jl777

    tetris tweaks``` on the 2 nodes I tried with. Deleted all chain data in `.komodo` before starting. 
```"blocks": 69521,
  "longestchain": 78141,```
During indexing there were many stops and starts where blocks would start syncing and then stop, with connection errors like Tony posted. Then syncing would start again.

Ah, on of the 2 nodes that was on the longest chain is now down.  Will try and restart.

*** A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 189 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

[29-Mar-19 08:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Few forks appeared maybe now. I guess we need chain reset

[30-Mar-19 01:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I still have one node up on longest chain.  ```"blocks": 79190,

Explorer is still on this chain also.

[31-Mar-19 12:13 AM] wookie#7663
Any remedies to the broken chain? @TonyL

[31-Mar-19 05:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe somebody with healthy node can make a bootstrap (as a temporary solution).  Unfortunately I don't have any healthy node at the moment and cant sync any

Run makerogue, then copy rogue cclib as libcc.so to src and rebuild daemon

👍 

[31-Mar-19 07:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`cp ./src/cc/cclib.cpp ./src/libcc.so`?

[31-Mar-19 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I'm not with PC right now so maybe misspelled exact files name

[31-Mar-19 07:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Just check which *.so file makerogue output (it printing file name on execution) and copy with same filename to src as makegames do. Then rebuild daemon by make in src

[31-Mar-19 07:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`libcc.so: file not recognized: File format not recognized
` will have a closer look

[31-Mar-19 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to copy not .cpp file but .so file

[31-Mar-19 07:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yep, just spotted that 😫

[31-Mar-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Its like a roguecclib.so or something like that, from phone now sorry

[31-Mar-19 07:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this feels more right `librogue.so`

[31-Mar-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Makerogue printing filename

[31-Mar-19 07:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the only .so file in ./makerogue std out is `rm -f rogue.so`

[31-Mar-19 07:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`librougue.so` seems to have worked tho

[31-Mar-19 07:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Just build.sh should work I wonder

[31-Mar-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
If it worked on your side after build.sh

[31-Mar-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Issue was just because you had lib for tetris, current instructions for rogue are correct I think because output of build.sh is komodod with rogue cclib at the moment

[31-Mar-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
heh, that would be easier.

[31-Mar-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can try again once confirm full sync reached

[31-Mar-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Guide which you posted don't have much sense because you executing build.sh in the end. If change build.sh to make in src - it will be a guide to make rogue daemon from tetris daemon

[31-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
But now just make clean and build.sh should do it I bet 😀

[31-Mar-19 07:59 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi guys, can you see this ip `103.208.220.139`?
