Lost 3 levels in first game on OSX - on level13 I had print "Couldnt finalize CCtx" on gaming screen (when I've entered this level) - so I guess it's related.

[23-Mar-19 06:36 PM] TonyL#3577
On lvl12 I step on teleportation trap - it teleported me to room with stairs and I went to lvl13

[23-Mar-19 06:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, have to check the replay

[23-Mar-19 06:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm starting to run in same room on lvl12 in replay

[23-Mar-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
On the last frame of replay I can see settings menu with keystrokes recorded into "Name" and "Fruit"

But I never called this menu in actual game

[23-Mar-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
In actual game I only fight with Aquator in this room and picked up gold - not used any items

[23-Mar-19 06:53 PM] TonyL#3577
It's quite strange - in replay my last position on lvl11 isnt on stairs

And then lvl12 I'm starting in replay from position different to original game

[23-Mar-19 06:53 PM] TonyL#3577
But room looks same

[23-Mar-19 06:54 PM] TonyL#3577
This game from unusual things - I read not detected scrolls and gave em names

Ahh and put ring of protection somewhere also

[23-Mar-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, like I'm magically somehow changed level two steps left from stairs and then somehow appeared one position upper on the next level

Maybe it's OSX specific somehow since both problem games are on OSX so far

[23-Mar-19 07:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Not even sure how it's possible to change level without stairs hit. And there is nothing suspicious in original gameplay - I'm just walking to stairs. Not using anything, not fighting, not picking up items or using inventory

Oh yes, but as expected progress stopped to record on dl15

At some point when you changing level you getting print ```FinalizeCCtx couldnt find 00000000000000000...0```
