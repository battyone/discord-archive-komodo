Anyone who wants to help with a promotion later on, please make "Komodo Warrior" characters.
Or something like that. I'm making level 3 ones. 
Granted they'll all die quick anyway.

[19-Feb-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, validation stuff. updating

[19-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
updated both jl777 and FSM

[19-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe there are other prints too?

[19-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
```1b790bd2e9cb2454a70df08a1287a999c89e1184f2c1851c081b9ca72da0866d matched after clearing maxstrength good.2 bad.0```this one I saw also on extraction

[19-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But it might help on debug

[19-Feb-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Just tried to transfer warrior by tokentransfer - seems working fine

[19-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
But recipient have to provide you pubkey since tokentransfer only to pubkey is possible

[19-Feb-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Warriors transfer added to TUI Utilities

is this your game?

This warrior which I've transferred is super old

[19-Feb-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Means played him yesterday üòÉ

[19-Feb-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Before most of the inventory changes

[19-Feb-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is a game validation that failed. packsize is very different so seems an old version played 2099 keystrokes

[19-Feb-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, it is yesterday game

Yes, I've played him yesterday

[19-Feb-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
before the packchange code. ok, that is why the gameplay was validated, to make sure the playerdata was valid. in this case not, as we hardforked gameplay

[19-Feb-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so over time we hope to see less and less such errors

so it is true that multiplayer just worked the first time?

[19-Feb-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems so, I've played only 2 games but it worked as expected in both cases. Made calls in TUI to make further testing faster so will test more with careful gold tracking

[19-Feb-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a when I broadcast bailout by one player, active players amount immediately decrease. When I broadcast highlander from second he getting pot

[19-Feb-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Slots filling seems correct also

[19-Feb-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
OK, I will make a 777 KMD bounty for any non-dev that gets the most ROGUE via legit gameplay. farming or multiplayer. your ROGUE address will be the proof of claim and I will send the KMD to the same address. Monday Feb 25th 12:00 UTC deadline

"Extracting Gold from the Dungeons of Doom" 
"Converting game gold to ROGUE"

[19-Feb-19 11:31 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Will post right away JL!

[19-Feb-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
TUI can print such messages

[19-Feb-19 11:32 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool, little stuff like that would be excellent

[19-Feb-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
just let tonyL know all such messages you want added

[19-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes TUI can print anything what players want üòÉ

[19-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I wonder if my son can win that bounty. Lol

[19-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw we can make ROGUE modifications by just text descriptions changing

[19-Feb-19 11:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll think of more things over time.

[19-Feb-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
If you call bows blasters and swords lightsabres

[19-Feb-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
You can make star wars

[19-Feb-19 11:35 AM] Cryptofist#7504
But the converting line, that will hype people up

[19-Feb-19 11:36 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL if you can throw that kind of the stuff into the TUI .... Crossed with the gold bounty promo will make some good traction.

[19-Feb-19 11:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Just send me some list

[19-Feb-19 11:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm hoping so, I'm trying to word some posts/articles so that it is encouraged to make various interfaces

[19-Feb-19 11:37 AM] TonyL#3577
What you want to print and on which step

[19-Feb-19 11:37 AM] TonyL#3577
And I'll add prints

[19-Feb-19 11:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Can you guys add cool things that print like ....

[19-Feb-19 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not native English speaker so there are definitely not gramatically correct prints

[19-Feb-19 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577
