`Leeroy Jenkins ` it's a warrior who detected this problem with inventory first. Since error was only on `rogue` side I've just did bailout manually and rescued him

ok. so with latest do arrows you throw and pickup, get merged back in? it seems it should

[16-Feb-19 12:48 PM] TonyL#3577

and use FSM branch, assuming that one is not crashy. jl777 branch will be under construction until I say it is stable

[16-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Latest is not crashy and full inventory works as expected. Will use FSM in future

[16-Feb-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember seeing arrows make their own inventory spot. maybe it changes when you throw it, vs drop?

[16-Feb-19 01:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Arrows unpacking after you throw it

[16-Feb-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a when you have pack with 30 arrows and throw one now there are two packs: pack with 29 arrows and pack with 1 arrow when you pick up

[16-Feb-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
A little bit strange logic imo - better if when you pickup arrow it adding to ",main" pack with arrows

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
you can try the rogue from the repo I got it from, pretty sure it behaves the same way

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's original logic

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then not a bug

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea how the inpack is out of sync now though

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577
And it's worked like this whole tests time - but by some reason just max inventory was broken

[16-Feb-19 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577

Ok, been fighting to get things running the last couple of days, this is where i get stuck after running zcutil.build

[16-Feb-19 04:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
started with origin/jl777 like in the guides, then genie recommended FSM.

[16-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I started with the rogue guide, then went back through after finding a komodo guide

[16-Feb-19 04:33 PM] SHossain#0007
jl777 branch is the latest for ROGUE

[16-Feb-19 04:33 PM] SHossain#0007
did you install all dependencies properly?

[16-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
i dont have komodod

[16-Feb-19 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, your build failed

[16-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm not sure  on dependencies , I did use the commands to install that i found

[16-Feb-19 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your system spec?

[16-Feb-19 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
you can try deleting everything and start following the guide from the beginning https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game

so just delete all the directories ?

and 4 cpu  38 gb drive  and like 8 ram

delete just the `komodo` dir

ok, thank you. I was wondering if starting all over would help.

[16-Feb-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007

give or take 5 tries

[16-Feb-19 05:26 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So if it doesn't work, just delete the folder and start over, is that the best action?

[16-Feb-19 05:26 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I followed it all thursday 2x, friday 2x at different times.

[16-Feb-19 05:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[16-Feb-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
not necessaarily you have to delete them all the time

[16-Feb-19 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
to be honest, it works first time if i use it in any new computer
