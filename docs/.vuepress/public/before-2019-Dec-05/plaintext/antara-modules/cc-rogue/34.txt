And in replay im dying on lvl1 (I've quited on lvl2 and warrior saved)

[17-Feb-19 12:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like some scary bug is here @jl777c

[17-Feb-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so wrong warrior data?

[17-Feb-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
At least there is a wrong replay

[17-Feb-19 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577

[17-Feb-19 12:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Like I was killed on level 1, but I quited on lvl2 and my progress saved

[17-Feb-19 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
"baton": "8431bbc5c53a22da74bf8bf955440c960795dca59f8b1e8dd2b5516f48362edc" of this game is alive player which I can see in `players 17`

[17-Feb-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
was that the player used?

[17-Feb-19 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
```Player txid: 8431bbc5c53a22da74bf8bf955440c960795dca59f8b1e8dd2b5516f48362edc
Token txid: 8431bbc5c53a22da74bf8bf955440c960795dca59f8b1e8dd2b5516f48362edc``` this one was used

[17-Feb-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
And it's in baton

[17-Feb-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
But in ```      "player": {
        "playertxid": "1a705d1e900ac760afd5bb24e0d6c40ce6bf10f42d3344559ad18ddfa6ee08bc",

[17-Feb-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
and replay isn't correct

[17-Feb-19 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it created a not-correct copy of my warrior somehow

[17-Feb-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if the wrong player is used for playback the playback will be broken. but I am not clear on what exactly happened. if you can make a sequence that makes it use/make the wrong data, that is what is needed

[17-Feb-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure. will try to describe sequence

[17-Feb-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@Cryptofist that game where things were all strange, i think if you drank a potion it could be due to that. one of them has psychadelic effects

[17-Feb-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL each bailout does create a new token, each register should be burning the old token

[17-Feb-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what exactly you mean

[17-Feb-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Ohh, I see now. Thats why warrior scanner see a lot of copies

[17-Feb-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm scanning tokenlist and playerinfo works for all burned and not burned

[17-Feb-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
So confusing

[17-Feb-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
burned warriers go to 0x02deaddeaddead...

[17-Feb-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a bug? if you are able to reuse a warrier, that is a bug

[17-Feb-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the tokenid is the txid of the tx that creates the token, which is the bailout

[17-Feb-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the register burns a player tokenid

[17-Feb-19 01:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Not possible to re-use, was just my confusion. Need to think now how to track dead warriors by scanner (or bailouted copies)

[17-Feb-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
filter out the 0x02dead addrss

[17-Feb-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RCGXh1vQHcHKPmSk7XERZimqXdAufn3vK9 ok, seems I've found burning address
Now have to find out how to check `tokenbalance` for it

[17-Feb-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
This address seems like a nice way to track global "total games played" (1 satoshi = 1 game)

[17-Feb-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
#define CC_BURNPUBKEY "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead"

[17-Feb-19 02:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh ok

[17-Feb-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 seems somewhat stable

[17-Feb-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577

Very dead.

[17-Feb-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i made a cursesd to replace -lcurses, so -daemon mode (and >/dev/null) is not needed anymore

treasure 

[17-Feb-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
rogue used the curses screenbuffer for gamestate!

[17-Feb-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so I couldnt just stub out all curses calls,but had to implement enough to the rogue gamestate is preserved

[17-Feb-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, there could be replays that dont work, but so far looks good

[17-Feb-19 02:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Sounds cool. May I update jl777 daemon and rogue to try or should wait more?

[17-Feb-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
sure

👌 

[17-Feb-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Will update warrior scanner now also to not show dead warrior in global warrior list in dex

[17-Feb-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
But for TOP20 rating will remain old scanner which counting experience of dead warriors as well

[17-Feb-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 10x faster now to validate games. a short game is validated in half a millisecond

🚀 (2) 

[17-Feb-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Since it's kinda "High scores list"

[17-Feb-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but it could be 19 copies of the "same" warrior

[17-Feb-19 02:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, but if I'll try to find out if it last copy of dead warrior I'll blow mind I'm afraid 😃

[17-Feb-19 02:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Can show only alive warriors in TOP if it fun enough for community 😃

[17-Feb-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be live warriors

[17-Feb-19 02:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so just updating scanner

[17-Feb-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the last copy of dead warrior is indeed not easy to do, though possible

[17-Feb-19 02:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, updated scanner

[17-Feb-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's working not fast at all now

[17-Feb-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Need to improve

@Cryptofist there is a teleportation ring, where half the time you are teleported! combined with the LSD potion, it would explain what you had the other day

[17-Feb-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
I've put cursed teleportation ring yesterday

[17-Feb-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Game was super fun lol

[17-Feb-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you werent able to remove it?

[17-Feb-19 02:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Cursed items not possible to remove until you use scroll of cursing removal

[17-Feb-19 02:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Or now all items remove when you bailout

[17-Feb-19 02:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Two ways to take off cursed item 😃

[17-Feb-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, just need to start over from level 1 again

[17-Feb-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and in multiplayer it is a loss, so the game theory seems ol

[17-Feb-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[17-Feb-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Because of such design changes I'm just dropping curse removal scrolls in singleplayer

[17-Feb-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
There is really hard choice what to put to inventory on high levels - so need to make decision based on gameplay 😃

[17-Feb-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
27 alive warriors now in game total

[17-Feb-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
4 are mine

[17-Feb-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
So I think we have around 10-15 players who saved warriors

[17-Feb-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i probably have half a dozen from tests

[17-Feb-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
latest cursesd version restored a player properly

[17-Feb-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
of course working in once case is nowhere near the works in all cases level...

[17-Feb-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Taking `--- 20.94345498085022 seconds ---` to form TOP20 alive warriors list
With just 103 tokens in tokenlist

[17-Feb-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
For each token in tokenlist I'm checking first if it warrior by output of playerinfo, then checking if it alive by `tokenbalance deadpubkey`

[17-Feb-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
If it match both then it adding to warriors list

[17-Feb-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
is it ever in tokenlist if it is dead? it shouldnt be

[17-Feb-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is unspent, it is alive

[17-Feb-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes burned tokens are in tokenlist

[17-Feb-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Only thing is changing after burning (after register transaction) is that it's transferring from my balance to deadpubkey address balance

[17-Feb-19 02:52 PM] TonyL#3577
If dead not in tokenlist my initial fast scanner will not show dead since it's checking all tokens from tokenlist

[17-Feb-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw are warriors tokens have 10000 supply by design?
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokeninfo babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c

  "description": "420cdd09cf369a451c52d84edd2b94fe5362d6fcbc21e53ad9edd98be6739682",```

[17-Feb-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Warriors tokens have 1000 supply, and player have 1 of them
Then after register player have 0 and pubkeydead address have 1

[17-Feb-19 02:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's a bug that creating 10000 supply tokens instead of 1 supply

[17-Feb-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes that is a bug, where it is creating 10000 of them? or even 1000?

[17-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
You can check tokeninfo for any warrior tokenid

[17-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
All of them have 10000 supply

[17-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
To create token with 1 supply needed:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokencreate TestSupply 0.00000001 ```
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokeninfo 7050b82b0385eb4858b609e539b4aa633f2e0e53585be3d742183ee426983ac5

```

[17-Feb-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe mistake with decimals somewhere

[17-Feb-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c has 1 satoshi output, seems tokenbalance might be wrong?

[17-Feb-19 03:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe hmm

[17-Feb-19 03:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Because `tokenbalance` for pubkey is 1 for warriors

[17-Feb-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a bug for dimxy to fix

[17-Feb-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Strange that when I'm creating token manually it have   "supply": 1. So I'm not sure which bug to report dimxy now

[17-Feb-19 03:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Is rogue creating tokens some special way?

[17-Feb-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
If no warriors specified token is creating on newgame stage?

[17-Feb-19 03:09 PM] TonyL#3577
There are  "value": 0.00010000, 
10000 satoshies vouts in newgame transaction

[17-Feb-19 03:09 PM] TonyL#3577
And no 1 satoshi vout so bug is definitely on newgame side I think.
 UPD: oh no, token is creating when register as you said, sorry
