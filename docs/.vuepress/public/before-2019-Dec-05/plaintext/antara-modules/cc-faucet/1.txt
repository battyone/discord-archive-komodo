theres only one default faucet in any chain correct? anybody can fund it and new pubkeys can get coins from it.

[15-Dec-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[15-Dec-18 02:50 PM] gcharang#6833
Ok. Is there any PoW done when `faucetget` is issued?

[15-Dec-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, txpow

[17-Dec-18 02:31 PM] gcharang#6833
This is the output of faucetaddress RPC:
```json

  "result": "success",

[17-Dec-18 02:32 PM] gcharang#6833
What is "FaucetCCassets" and "Faucetmarker" ?

[17-Dec-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
internal addresses

[17-Dec-18 02:35 PM] gcharang#6833
No need to explain them in docs?

[17-Dec-18 02:35 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean won't a dapp developer using RPC interface find them useful?

[17-Dec-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
just say they are used internall

[17-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just using a standard template to print assets CC addresses and marker addresses, only really useful for gateways and a few other CC

[17-Dec-18 02:37 PM] gcharang#6833
ahh got it. Any difference between `myCCaddress` and `CCaddress` ? Will they be different for some cc?

[17-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
for CC that use nonstandard 1of1 CC, like channels, likely it will be different

[17-Dec-18 02:48 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.

I'm running the daemon with this pubkey `02fbccd779e492bcf3b12707c1461ea857b4e2ee0ad990f13059c02189bd5d8eda`

Documentation for developers building on Komodo

[27-Jan-19 02:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this says the command parameter `pubkey` is optional for `faucetaddress` method

[27-Jan-19 02:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was expecting if given the `pubkey`different to the one which is in daemon start, it will give me the CC address from that pubkey

[27-Jan-19 02:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I still get the same CC address for the `pubkey` used in daemon start, instead of getting the address for the `pubkey` from newly generated address.

[27-Jan-19 02:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Is that expected behavior ?

[27-Jan-19 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant change -pubkey once it is set.

[27-Jan-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't want to change -pubkey
Want to get different address if faucet command is used with different pubkey

[27-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Mylo#8306
yes it reads a bit differently to the behaviour.   I'm just doing some maint and will repeat.

[27-Jan-19 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant cange the poubkey... ALL CC contracts use the -pubkey... if somehting says thats not the case then the document is wrong

[27-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Mylo#8306
@grewalsatinder there is only 1 faucet on the chain.  so you can't have another faucet address from what i understand.

[27-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Mylo#8306
it's like a singleton

[27-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Mylo#8306
i might be wrong.

[27-Jan-19 10:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
@grewalsatinder The faucet address is a global CC address. So per chain you will have only one faucet address.

[27-Jan-19 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mihailo Is your answer for this API call?
```faucetaddress

faucetaddress [pubkey]

The faucetaddress method returns the CC address information for the specified pubkey. If no pubkey is provided, the method returns information for the pubkey used to launch the daemon.```

[27-Jan-19 10:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```Arguments:
Structure     Type     Description
pubkey     (string, optional)     the desired pubkey; the method uses the pubkey used to launch the daemon if no pubkey is provided
```

[27-Jan-19 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was only looking at this answer:
```myaddress     (string)     the unmodified public address of the pubkey used to launch the chain```

[27-Jan-19 10:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
launched chain with this address's pubkey : `RAhsSqt1kaCz8JVNqDiDNFSVeYTubrLDSz`

[27-Jan-19 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so without supplying pubkey to `faucetaddress` I get `myaddress` as `RAhsSqt1kaCz8JVNqDiDNFSVeYTubrLDSz` in answer.

[27-Jan-19 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which is expected result

[27-Jan-19 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I re-read the help doc again to see If I misunderstood anything.

[27-Jan-19 10:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I get the point that if the chain is launched with the `-pubkey` that address is set for the chain to be used like the default address for:
- change address
- using the `-pubkey` pubkey to generate the CC address, the `myaddres` for the end user to recieve the funds to, or whatever the user is using that `myaddress` for that whatever X CC.

[27-Jan-19 10:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Re-reading cleared that the faucet will only send the funds just **once** and no more, if the address pubkey supplied to the daemon has no funds in it.

[27-Jan-19 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what if I want to use the **other** address?

[27-Jan-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The option is:
getnewaddress
validateaddress, get pubkey,
restart daemon with that pubkey
faucetaddress to get the `myCCaddress` for that pubkey

[27-Jan-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no way for the blockchain to know if an address is "other" for you

[27-Jan-19 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought this restart was not needed.

[27-Jan-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks at activity in an address to decide if it should allow faucetget

[27-Jan-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I've just tried to generate new address and change pubkey param

[27-Jan-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
`myaddress` in faucetaddress changed to new one

[27-Jan-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
```-pubkey=03f5312a0f06c281cb11d34a2a77fe66a8e3e74e23169bf12bf2eaa21c28d9e505
```
For this pubkey I get ```  "myaddress": "RV3dpmH95Y6QmPNcFRJTXMrLPZQ89keTky"```

[27-Jan-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 validateaddress RV3dpmH95Y6QmPNcFRJTXMrLPZQ89keTky

 "iscompressed": true,
 "account": ""
}```

[27-Jan-19 11:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Then I get new address
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 getnewaddress
RSjeEtHimVPv913AE1WQSWeY2uJpwoERVK
```
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 validateaddress RSjeEtHimVPv913AE1WQSWeY2uJpwoERVK
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "RSjeEtHimVPv913AE1WQSWeY2uJpwoERVK",

  "iscompressed": true,
  "account": ""
}
```

[27-Jan-19 11:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Stopped daemon
```  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 stop
TONY11 server stopping
```

[27-Jan-19 11:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Started with new pubkey:
```-pubkey=024f4f2b781c247b3609ba777a222d93d44182466c01dad3f2aa0def2be8f69e56```

[27-Jan-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
And get in `faucetaddress`:
```"myaddress": "RSjeEtHimVPv913AE1WQSWeY2uJpwoERVK"```

[27-Jan-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
So everything seems to work as expected

[27-Jan-19 11:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL yep, that is expected behavior, as I understood.

That is what I was trying, I thought I'll get different `myCCaddress`. Understood I'll need to restart daemon to get that new `myCCaddress`

[27-Jan-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh so point is not `myaddress` but `myCCaddress`

[27-Jan-19 11:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Why does daemon restart is needed for getting new `myCCaddress` ?

[27-Jan-19 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@tony yes mate

[27-Jan-19 11:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Let me try and test the daemon without staring it with any `-pubkey` param

[27-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
pretty sure supplying it a pubkey works if `-pubkey` is not set

[27-Jan-19 11:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

😄

[27-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
but yes @grewalsatinder has a point

[27-Jan-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
`myCCaddress` generating for pubkey from -pubkey param and evalcode as I understand

[27-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
it should either not have any arguments or should work for the pubkey you provide it

[27-Jan-19 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So in your example above you're using daemon with same `-pubkey` param

For daemons started with different pubkeys

[27-Jan-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
But you've used some `pubkey` as faucetaddress argument - I'm not totally sure which addresses it should show in this case

[27-Jan-19 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL my point is, if there is an option in the command to supply the `pubkey` it should give me the `myCCaddress` for that pubkey, that was what I was expecting.

[27-Jan-19 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn't understand the need for the option if the pubkey has to be supplied to daemon at start

[27-Jan-19 11:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that case supplying pubkey to the client command is not needed at all.

[27-Jan-19 11:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if needed, then that supplied pubkey's `myCCaddress` is expected to be used

[27-Jan-19 11:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless my understanding is not clear or there is some misunderstanding

[27-Jan-19 11:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
felt confused, so trying to clear things

[27-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Alright#0419
it should either not have any arguments or should work for the pubkey you provide it

[27-Jan-19 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
or am I crazy? I think it's clear it's a bug or unimplemented feature

[27-Jan-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should not have any arguments

[27-Jan-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if pubkey is not set

[27-Jan-19 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should tell you its not set

[27-Jan-19 11:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright yep, you and me are on same page... I think 😅

[27-Jan-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm channelsCC's `channelsadress` works only with pubkey provided

[27-Jan-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY11 channelsaddress
error code: -1
error message:
channelsaddress destpubkey
```

[27-Jan-19 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its a bug with faucvet address then

[27-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
Yea I think I've used it with providing pubkey before

[27-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
at least other CC address commands

[27-Jan-19 11:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to me, I think it shoulkd only return when pubke is set... as ALL the other RPCs are like that.

[27-Jan-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r Do you mean `-pubkey` as daemon argument or as RPC call argument?

[27-Jan-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as deamon argument

[27-Jan-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
If you not set `-pubkey` as daemon argument it will return error
