i'm just depositing only 0.01 KMD each time

[30-Nov-19 04:53 PM] SHossain#0007
as you mentioned couple of days ago `to submit the missing heights on oraclefeed startup` would be nice to have

[30-Nov-19 04:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i will try to use different `nvout` and `amount` for importing than what i'm depositing. initial tests showed i can't do that as using fake amounts doesn't validate the `burntxid`
```
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "burntxid didnt validate!"
}
```

[30-Nov-19 04:58 PM] SHossain#0007
i wonder what other case i can use to abuse the deposits 🤔

[30-Nov-19 05:01 PM] SHossain#0007
if i ONLY change `nvout` (the marker tx amount) to `0` or anything else, it validates the import

[30-Nov-19 05:02 PM] SHossain#0007
but, that marker amount doesn't do anything extra as that is not the deposit amount and it doesn't get credited

[30-Nov-19 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007

3 deposits of `0.01` and 5 mined block reward

[30-Nov-19 06:26 PM] SHossain#0007
it seems marker amount doesn't matter much. tried with lower than 0.0001 and it worked
```

for some reason this deposit tx not being credited into my account for some time `931f313c815cd593ffb2f3d96e09882dfdd9fc4edbccf22531276575d82b9046`

[01-Dec-19 12:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
It didn't got into mempool probably for some time, don't know why, had this things before

[01-Dec-19 12:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think it is a node sync problem...

[01-Dec-19 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
it's not critical issue. i just wanted to report

[01-Dec-19 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll get to testing again tomorrow

[02-Dec-19 01:24 PM] SHossain#0007
wonder if it's just me or oraclefeed validates txs very quickly

[02-Dec-19 01:24 PM] SHossain#0007
no need to wait longer for the txid to be validated by oraclefeed

[02-Dec-19 01:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hehe, I just wanted to write to JL about that. In some refactor I removed the 10 block behind limit

[02-Dec-19 01:26 PM] SHossain#0007
makes sense. deposits are faster now

[02-Dec-19 01:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i will start testing parallel withdrawing now.

[02-Dec-19 01:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I wanted to see is there some smart reason why you made initally oraclefeed to be 10 blocks behind?

[02-Dec-19 01:33 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe for security? as dPoW works at 10 min interval

[02-Dec-19 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, probably. To try to leave it to be notarized.

[02-Dec-19 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll return this soon.

[02-Dec-19 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mihailo do you think making 2 or 3 withdraw HEX first and brodcasting them one by one would be parallel?

[02-Dec-19 01:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
Parallel in this case is basically to broadcast multiple withdraws before withdraws are processed. So basically the best test would be to broadcast few withdraws in one block and then check if they are going to be received to the address one by one. You can do several mportgatewaywithdraw and sendrawtransaction fast so that they get into same block.

[02-Dec-19 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. my commands are ready. will issue them now. if you like, you can monitor your processing nodes

[02-Dec-19 01:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[02-Dec-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, to have things notarized, the delay was added

[02-Dec-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810

different one above

But, the other two were created on same utxo.

[02-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
I have to check what is going on.

[02-Dec-19 01:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll mark those withdraws done, but funds won't be lost. You'll just need to have some more coins to withdraw that...

[02-Dec-19 01:53 PM] SHossain#0007
it's fine. if needed you can keep those funds into gateway address for testing

[02-Dec-19 01:54 PM] SHossain#0007
the way i created those withdraws was
1. issue `importgatewaywithdraw` 
2. issue `sendrawtransaction` with the hex from above
3. same `1` & `2` for 2 more withdraws

[02-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, that was fine

[03-Dec-19 08:58 AM] Alright#0419
Could you explain the interaction between kmd node and MBTCTEST node? Must KMD be running the latest pegs code? Is it only needed on gateway?

[03-Dec-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
only the gateways needs to run the KMD

[03-Dec-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if you are making deposits, you probably want a KMD node, maybe eventually we can also support using nspv node

is the deposit any special kind of tx?

@msig-signers please generate 2 keys SECURELY as you would do for your notary nodes. 1 key we will use soon for testing and other will be used for production. please don't use those keys with Agama or any other application. best to generate them on an offline computer. once you have keys, please DM me the test `pubkey` only. keep the production key safe. and, as always, never share your private key 🙂

Also, feel free to ask me if you have any question.

I have paused oraclefeed as I have a bug in new withdraw process. I'll continue it tomorrow. Hold any deposits for now.

Thanks. not depositing any more now. i have enough to test withdraws when you resume

`please don't use those keys with Agama` 🤣 i'll ping you the test key shortly

@jl777c I have a case I already mentioned, but now it is making me a real problem. Now that signing is in mempool, it often happens that nodes start signing withdraw at the same time and they create a separate sign txs both with one sign and spending the same utxo from withdraw. Then one of them gets mined but the other that is not mined stays still in wallet of the node which created it and every next block it is trying to add it to mempool. I think we have to address this problem that when the chain tip moves every tx that refers to unspent utxo should be discarded. I don't know if this will break something, and maybe someone made it like it is now at some point!

we probably need to add a specific test for an invalid utxo in mempool and purge it. would that fix the issue?

[04-Dec-19 06:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, so if on the next block the tx is removed then it will continue signing normaly until again 2 or more nodes does the same. I was thinking how could I sync the oraclfeed nodes so that there is no race condition, but didn't think of anything.

If you have some cool idea happy to hear it.

[04-Dec-19 06:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
When I restart the daemon, tx is gone. But if daemon stays running, the tx will be there indefinetly (I think)

[04-Dec-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there is code that purges the mempool when a tx expires

[04-Dec-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you can look at that to see how to properly purge a tx

[04-Dec-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
then on a new block, iterate the mempool (actually i think in main.cpp it already iterates the mempool) and make sure all tx in the mempool still have valid inputs

[04-Dec-19 06:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I'll get on it now.
