or.. You could do both and the market decide. Of course, I don't have to code it..

[13-Jul-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
pegs is not primarily for traders, prices CC is more for traders

[13-Jul-19 08:29 AM] damon#7265
So... It's December 2017 and Cryptos are at all time highs, but you know it's all going to come crashing back down. How do you invest in FIAT, virtually, without going thru the Banks or using USD Backed Coins?

[13-Jul-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, in this case hedge at max 80% and write off the 20%

[13-Jul-19 08:35 AM] damon#7265
Buy KUSD instead of LOCK-IN.

[13-Jul-19 08:35 AM] damon#7265
I appreciate all the time you put into answering my questions..

[13-Jul-19 08:35 AM] damon#7265
Thanks

[13-Jul-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
thanks for identifying needed automation

[13-Jul-19 08:59 AM] damon#7265
Well.. I have about 10 more items, but it's late here and I've taken enough of your time.. Thanks again

[13-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810

Will future KUSD, KMD$  contract be linear or inverse  ? Why the question, the inverse  contract in the derivative exchanges with the leverage of 1x   short practically does not have the price of liquidation - the approximate price of a margin call is about 1 $ million per 1 BTC. Are we SAFU ? Below is an explanation of my question.


When you are trading BTC on Deribit or Bitmex, you are using the inverse futures contracts. Perpetual and the 2 other quarterly futures contracts are inverse.

So on inverse USD/BTC it’s quoted at BTC/USD and the chart also shown as BTC/USD.

Short on inverse 1x leverage to lock-in USD (hedge)
When opening a 1x leverage short on an inverse futures contract, you will “lock-in” the USD value. This is why many professional traders short BTC on an inverse futures contract. It’s a great hedge. When you’re short with 1x leverage on an inverse futures contract, it’s almost impossible to get margin called. You could enter a short at $10k and BTC could move to 1 million dollar and you would still not be margin called. This is great for hedging.
Your short position with 1x leverage is always worth the amount of dollars because when you short on BTC/USD on an inverse futures contract, you are actually long on USD/BTC. You actually buy an amount of USD priced in BTC

Many of you may not know this, but if you want to eliminate your bitcoin exposure without actually going through the process of converting to fiat you can move your holdings into synthetic USD on https://t.co/qr49NsLQCU by shorting with 1x leverage.

you are making it overcomplicated

[13-Jul-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what the pegs CC does is track the amount of loan the issued USDK represents

[13-Jul-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD deposited has a USD equivalent price, this is calculated by a simple multiplication of number of KMD by the current price in USD

[13-Jul-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so 100 KMD at $1 is $100 of deposit

[13-Jul-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the amount loaned is easy as it is in USD, so if you borrowed 80 USDK from the 100KMD, the loan percentage changes by:
80 / (KMD * price)

[13-Jul-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
its not inverse futures, or options, or anything other than USDK backed by KMD, with the overall system maintaining its balance by the game theory optimal behaviors of the participants, depositor/borrowers and liquidators. as long as liquidators like risk free arbitrage and as long as depositors dont like giving away 10% of their equity, the system will stay in balance out of the danger zone

[13-Jul-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the one event that could temporarily affect liquidity is if the price drops dramatically in a time period that is much less than a day. in this case it will take a day for the 24hr average price to catch up to the realtime price

[13-Jul-19 05:46 PM] CMaurice#1685
this built fine for me on Debian sid

[13-Jul-19 05:46 PM] CMaurice#1685
seems to be up and running ok with -pubkey, and mining but lots of `00950d9821097f79a63e982f50e9e58ed88a1a808868916261e478d55301c36d Invalid block mined, try again

[14-Jul-19 09:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
I suppose you can argue about it, but not if you're a mathematician. BTC/USD 11096.6950 is wrong

[14-Jul-19 09:38 AM] CMaurice#1685
BTC over USD, or BTC per USD? Nope, it is USD per BTC

[14-Jul-19 11:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
Not that I can't work the way others wish to after over four decades of this plaguing me

[14-Jul-19 11:23 AM] CMaurice#1685
But it's still wrong

[14-Jul-19 04:35 PM] damon#7265
Say I lock in KMD and sell my KUSD, then KMD goes up 10X, and now I want to unlock cc-pegs to release my KMD.
Do, I buy back KUSD on the market, the same amount that was in the pegs contract to release my KMD?

[14-Jul-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[14-Jul-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC divided by USD is indeed approx 11k

[14-Jul-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC/USD makes perfect sense to me

[14-Jul-19 05:38 PM] CMaurice#1685
oh, so I see BTC and USD as being units, not amounts, so BTC/USD is 1/11k to me

[14-Jul-19 05:40 PM] CMaurice#1685
if unit manipulation is used to create synthetics, guess it'll be consistent

[14-Jul-19 06:06 PM] damon#7265
What if KUSD isn't for sale on the market?

[14-Jul-19 06:08 PM] damon#7265
If the price of the whole crypto market is crashing and no one wants to sell?
How do you keep price pegged to $1?

[14-Jul-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you can just deposit KMD and borrow 80% if nobody is willing to sell

[14-Jul-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
in the day of a catastrophic crash, then liquidations will likely stop for a bit, but as soon as things calm down, the daily average will return to where the realtime price is, at least within 10% of it

[14-Jul-19 07:31 PM] damon#7265
If you're already leveraged in KMD and the price is falling (liquidation looming) and no one is selling KUSD?

[14-Jul-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying that the demand for KUSD is overwhelming and it breaks the peg by going above $1?

[14-Jul-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody has to have the KUSD, if you are not willing or able to, somebody else will liquidate it to get the overall system back into balance

[14-Jul-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and with enough KMD to more than 110% back the issued KUSD, there doesnt seem to be a reason the peg wont hold

[14-Jul-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i can see that maybe KUSD would trade at some fixed discount, due to slippage, fees and other risk factors that the market prices in, we might need to lock $1.02 worth of KMD to establish a marketprice of $1

[14-Jul-19 07:51 PM] damon#7265
It might rebound that way..

[14-Jul-19 07:58 PM] damon#7265
If liquidators only bought KUSD or liquidated for KMD and never sold.... and if Liquidators were a significant portion of the eco-system... it would go unstable.. But, maybe this is not likely??

[14-Jul-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it only takes a single liquidator to keep the system in balance

[14-Jul-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and such a liquidator would have KUSD onhand to liquidate with

[14-Jul-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
each liquidation, he gets more KMD, though if there are no sellers and KUSD is trading above $1.. then things could get stuck for a while. not sure if it is considered a failed peg if the price goes above the target

[14-Jul-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if it goes below, then that would mean there is plenty of KUSD available

[14-Jul-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, if you specify that there wont be any competent liquidators at all and nobody will be liquidating, then certainly many failure modes can be created, but that contradicts the "people like risk free profits" rule

[14-Jul-19 08:06 PM] damon#7265
for sure - this is the wild wild west

[14-Jul-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if we let enough people that like risk free profits know how to run the automated liquidation program

[14-Jul-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we wont have a lack of liquidators

[14-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
much less resource intensive than mining and potentially more lucrative

[14-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
just advertise to CPU miners, a new form of mining

[14-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe that is one source of demand for KUSD

[14-Jul-19 08:28 PM] damon#7265
I think I got it..

If the price goes far above $1.00 then it is a failed peg in a sense, at a minimum, those at risk of Liquidation. Now, it's 2018, price is falling, the Liquidators want KUSD (but ran out after the 1st month of liquidating), the ones about to be Liquidated want KUSD (and can't find any), and the ones wanting to Hedge the 2 yr fall in price don't want to sell.

Everything might freeze for a while if the crash is bad enough. But... this is more or less as intended. Those who short at the right time do well, those who went long do poorly, and the Liquidators are effectively market makers that make bank while things are roaring and very little when no trading is occurring.

[14-Jul-19 08:55 PM] damon#7265
In normal trading if you invest in Nike and Nike goes up 40% then you make 40% but if Nike drops by 40% then you lose 40%.

With cc-pegs, if KMD goes up 40% then you gain 40%, but if KMD drops 40% you lose 100% (unless your watching closely and have the funds to patch the hole and KUSD is available on the market).

In this system, it's more advantageous to be the Buyer of KUSD or the Liquidator, then the Creator.

Do you think this could be better balanced, to attract KUSD Creators?

[14-Jul-19 09:26 PM] damon#7265
One way would be, instead of Liquidators paying the full amount of KUSD (and getting full amount of KMD), they would only pay the difference in price, and liquidation would occur in proper portions with a 5% or 10% fee.

[14-Jul-19 09:50 PM] damon#7265
I'm imagining a Creator frantically trying to fix his cc-pegs contract. KMD is in an extended downtrend and is only able to acquire 50% of KUSD or even still has 50% of KUSD. This way the Liquidator only pays the remaining 50%, both burned, unlocking  KMD @ 50/50, minus a fee against the Creator.

[15-Jul-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the borrower has a big advantage since they can borrow (repay) at anytime, for a very volatile thing

[15-Jul-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you exaggerate the unintended liquidation scenario

[15-Jul-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if you take out a 50% loan during normal times, even weekly checking would be enough. if you take out an 80% loan during highly volatile times, then is it so unreasonable that you need to check the price daily??

[15-Jul-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
we do need a way for user to auto-replenish their account to prevent it from being liquidated, but extremely leveraged borrowers that dont pay attention... what really can be done about them

[15-Jul-19 06:37 PM] damon#7265
It might be an exaggerated issue..

[15-Jul-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo can implement can implement an rpc call to detect any account that is getting close to the danger zone, and also a way to replenish

[15-Jul-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
GUI can just call this function and replenish or warn user when it is appropriate

[15-Jul-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we need to assume that people will behave as the game theory will dictate and not base it on risk takers that dont monitor things

[15-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, we can add whatever rpc is needed to make good automated GUI that will protect users.

[15-Jul-19 06:43 PM] damon#7265
Can the borrower replenish from both directions?

[15-Jul-19 06:45 PM] damon#7265
Meaning, Not be liquidated if still holding KUSD or used for the liquidation calculation?

[15-Jul-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
borrower should be able to add either KMD or KUSD at any time to reduce the loan ratio

[15-Jul-19 06:54 PM] damon#7265
Any future plans to collateralize other Coins?

[15-Jul-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the tech allows any bitcoin protocol coin to be used as collateral, it is a matter to setup the gateways CC

It seems to me that one problem with making such a chain (stablecoin) popular will be any real and/or percieved risk, e.g. from hacks or bugs etc., to deposited coins. Maybe some assurance contract or locked funds by guarantors might be an idea, but I'm sure someone must've been thinking about this for a while

[19-Jul-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
plan is to have a 7 of 13 multisig

[19-Jul-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
with the top NN operators being the 13

[19-Jul-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
other than the multisig redeem, everything else is blockchain enforced

[31-Jul-19 04:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey have couple of questions regarding this:

- liquidator would make a special transaction that sends the debt owed to the system (is it documented anywhere?)
- And then (liquidator) is able to spend your collateral to himself ( is this spending procedure documented too?)

[31-Jul-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo how is the details pegs documentation coming along?

[31-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I've made the initial documentation about pegs, but haven't got time to improve it so far as I'm on nSPV CC.

[31-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
@kimmel (Pungo.io) 
- liquidator gives the amount that the other account has in debt and gets ~5.1% more than he gave at that moemnt in deposited crypto. The rest goes to the system.
- liquidator will get tokens of deposited crypto so you he can withdraw them from gateway whenever he likes

[31-Jul-19 05:05 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
hey @Mihailo thanks for fast answer, can you let me know when you can put up all doc regarding this together?

[31-Jul-19 05:06 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
we might give it a try, but definitely if all those calls are spv-friendly for sure it will be much easier to implement somewhere

[31-Jul-19 05:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
@kimmel (Pungo.io) The docs need refactoring as we get feedback what is unclear from the first read. I will try to add stuff to docs when I can. But be aware that pegscc is still in development. We haven't tested it properly yet, and there isn't any validation done yet so now you can do what ever bad stuff gets on your mind 😛

[31-Jul-19 05:12 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
good to know, should get to test it as it gets ready

[31-Jul-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo maybe as you work with shossain, you can spend a bit of time on the documentation side so he can understand enough and help with it too

[01-Aug-19 07:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've been referring to the docs at https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Pegs-CC
one thing that is not clear is the `pegstxid` is, apart from a required param for most methods. 
Can you please also confirm the current recommended repo to build and test from?
