15 is the max that fits
practically speaking 7 of 13 signers should be sufficient
```

[04-Dec-19 09:07 PM] SHossain#0007
13 is the lucky number i guess ðŸ™‚

[04-Dec-19 09:08 PM] Alright#0419
7 of 15 means 9 signers must disappear to kill gateway
7 of 13 means 7 

Again unlikely to happen, but I don't understand why 13 would be chosen instead of 15

[04-Dec-19 09:10 PM] SHossain#0007
James would have to explain that to you.

[04-Dec-19 09:10 PM] SHossain#0007
we can only speculate different things

[04-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
If it was 15 it would be 8of15. To have more than 51% ðŸ˜‰

[04-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
might be something obvious I hadn't considered

[04-Dec-19 09:11 PM] SHossain#0007
`If it was 15 it would be 8of15. To have more than 51% :wink:`
yep

[04-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
increasing sigs isn't always necessarily better

[04-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
it decreases the amount of people that need to disappear to lock funds forever

[04-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, nope

[04-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, but it increases the number of people that needs to be corrupt to steal funds ðŸ˜‰

[04-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
ignore me, just sitting here zoned out still thinking about that math problem

[04-Dec-19 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
I have that wrong anyway

[04-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
oh, no that's right ðŸ˜« 
8of15 requires only 8 people to disappear compared to 7of15 at 9

[04-Dec-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
after 1 or 2 disappear, a new msig is created

[04-Dec-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
also to do a 13 of 64 multisig, i came up with the notarization method, and while that can be added to KMD, I doubt BTC legacy devs would be open to any such PR

[04-Dec-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
a combined if/else each with a multisig redeemscript can be made, but why do all this?

[04-Dec-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the solution to disappearing operators is to transfer funds to a new set of signers. i am assuming that can be done or is the chain hardcoded to a specific multisig signers?

[04-Dec-19 09:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ah, also forgot that limit of msig address is 15 ðŸ˜‰

[04-Dec-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
how is the msig address specified? is there a way to change that after chain is launched?

[04-Dec-19 09:22 PM] SHossain#0007
https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Side-chain-setup-(Import-Gateway-CC)#import-gateway-bind

[04-Dec-19 09:22 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess it's specified at that point of setting up side chains which becomes hardcoded

[04-Dec-19 09:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
How do you mean how it is specified?

[04-Dec-19 09:25 PM] SHossain#0007
can we change the msig address after few months if required without changing chain param or without any hardfork of the chain?

[04-Dec-19 09:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
Oh. Well I think we can change ot if we change the order of pubkeys.

[04-Dec-19 09:27 PM] SHossain#0007
nice. can we remove old key and add new ones on the fly?

[04-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
Like in code we can reverse or somthing like that and we would get different addres

[04-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
That no

[04-Dec-19 09:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
When a bind tx is made it cannot be changed

[04-Dec-19 09:28 PM] SHossain#0007
for example, if one signer want to stop permanently and we get a new signer, how would we go about that?

[04-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
Have to think about it

[04-Dec-19 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks.
there are certain things in life that we can't control. we might find ourselves in a situation to change a single key or more in the future.

[04-Dec-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to support a way to change the msig signers. as long as the current msig signers sign this, then we can make a new set active. not sure the best way to implement this

[04-Dec-19 09:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
For regular gateway it could be done easily as new one could be created and funds from one deposit addres could be moved to other. But importgateway is hard as there is only one bindtx that is supported in earlytxid param.

[04-Dec-19 09:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
If we make a list of pubkeys of chain then it could be done but again that is then not in consensus and we would need to make some external consensus on pubkey change

[04-Dec-19 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
could always airdrop to a new chain, but you lose tx history each time you do that

[04-Dec-19 09:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, new chain is possible. But I think it is way too much work for a pubkey change

[04-Dec-19 09:56 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't ever really happen, but would want to be prepared. Just suggested that in case it's very much impractical to make it work otherwise

[04-Dec-19 09:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c if signer nodes would work p2p as notary nodes, we could make pubkeys approval and msig signing offchain, but it would require careful development.

[04-Dec-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there was a way to update the earlytxid?

[04-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, maybe we can put pubkeys in anothertx which wouldn't ve bind tx, but it would spend a baton from bindtx so we know it is the right one and next would spend baton from previous. It would work in a way as withdraw works. MofN would need to sign some external tx which will transfer funds from one deposit to another deposit addres and in opret has pubkeys list and that would be submitted as transfer tx and from that point it will look that tx for pubkeys.

[04-Dec-19 10:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
If it is understandable...

[04-Dec-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the list of pubkeys is what is in the earlytxid, with a msig baton

[04-Dec-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
something like that. it would allow the msig signers to update to a new set of pubkeys, baton makes it mutually exclusive. we can have the convention that the two most recent set of pubkeys are valid. that allows a smooth transition

[04-Dec-19 10:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so the new set of pubkeys is approved by the msig signers. now both addresses are valid, so there shouldnt be a problem with transferring funds from the old to the new address

[04-Dec-19 10:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, remind me to try to refactor it to support this. But first I need to finish this refactor and make withdraw to work smoothly.

[04-Dec-19 10:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is not needed for the next iteration, but a very good thing to have before production release

[04-Dec-19 10:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
Before production we must have this.

[04-Dec-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[04-Dec-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely seems solvable

Cool video on Stablecoins from CoinfestUK 2019. Seems related to this channel if anyone is interested
