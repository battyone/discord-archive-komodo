When you payback the loan, you get the deposited tokens. Only fee that you have is txfee 😉

[10-Jul-19 12:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It would be good to somehow claim the rewards if possible for the held KMD to go back into the "safu" fund

[10-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
You mean the rewards for holding KMD (the yearly 5.1%)?

[10-Jul-19 12:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
yes

[10-Jul-19 12:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But somehow claim that whilst the KMD are held as collateral as the "interest" on the loan

the multisig rewards go to the multisig signers

[10-Jul-19 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think JL mentioned before that the rewards could also go to the system to improve the overall ratio. The point here is to keep the system stable, and not the profit 😉

[10-Jul-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is interest free loans as far as the pegs are concerned

[10-Jul-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a pretty good rate

[10-Jul-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and with the multisig rewards split between the multisig signers, that should provide enough incentive to keep the nodes running

True, otherwise no one would run it 😄

This is the draft docs for Pegs CC and it is still work in progress. https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Pegs-CC
I would really like some comments and suggestions as I'm writting this with understanding of pegs, and would like to hear what was difficult to understand or confusing for someone that has no knowledge of pegs CC, so we can end up with very clear and easy to understand docs.

Stable Coin mechanisms like Maker/DAI are fascinating.
But, I don't understand how Liquidation occurs?

If KMD drops below a certain level, someone else can step in and liquidate (buy KUSD likely at a discount)? and a reduced amount of KMD is returned to the original account, while 5% goes to a global reserve account? What does the liquidator receive for the KUSD that's going to get burned?

Comment: If DEX achieves a certain level of Liquidity, Liquidation could be Automatic.

[13-Jul-19 05:27 AM] damon#7265
2nd Question.

I lock KMD to get KUSD. I use the KUSD to buy KMD on the Market. I then lock this KMD to get more KUSD. Rinse and Repeat.

Is there protection built-in? For instance, not allowing 100% LOCK-IN? Otherwise creation of Money is endless?

I suppose if you locked in 100% and KMD dropped 1%, you'd risk being liquidated, so maybe that's the protection?

[13-Jul-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
cant borrow more than 80%

[13-Jul-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if you get over 90% loan (based on market fluctuation), anybody can liquidate your account and get 100% of your KMD for the 90% USDK

[13-Jul-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
pocketing a 5% liquidation fee

[13-Jul-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
all the stablecoin is burned and all the KMD goes to the liquidator, so the global ratio is improved

[13-Jul-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically there will be many that run automated "miners" to race to collect the liquidation fee, which is 5% + 10% of the system side for a 5.5% at the 90% level, the incentive is to liquidate as close to the 90% mark as possibl

[13-Jul-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so if no account is more than 90% loaned out the global balance must be less than 90%

[13-Jul-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
even if you dont have any stablecoins to liquidate, if there is a nice account ready to be harvested, you can create stablecoins one block and then use it to liquidate the other account

[13-Jul-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
since people like free money, i expect there will be people who will like to do this

[13-Jul-19 05:38 AM] damon#7265
Hmmm..  Thinking out loud..

Automated Liquidators, liquidate and get the KMD.

They then dump KMD on the Market (for KUSD), further driving the price down.
They then use the KUSD to liquidate others.
Rinse and Repeat until destabilization.

Am I missing something?

[13-Jul-19 05:42 AM] damon#7265
Maybe some really long Block Count delays?

[13-Jul-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
24 hour price is used for settlement

[13-Jul-19 05:43 AM] damon#7265
ah.. You might have covered all the bases..

[13-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the one issue is if the spot price stays 10% below the 24hour price forever

[13-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but that cant happen

[13-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is possible that for some period time during extreme volatility that nobody will want to liquidate

[13-Jul-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but as the 24hour price gets to within 10% of the spot price the arbitrage is possible again and the system will restore itself to balance

[13-Jul-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD price going up is the easy case and the system just gets lower and lower percentage loaned

[13-Jul-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can see any other attack vector, definitely interested. it is a bit on the complex side, so definitely possible for there to be edge cases

[13-Jul-19 05:48 AM] damon#7265
That just might work.. Might have to think on it over the weekend and see if I can break it..  and UP is always the easy part..

[13-Jul-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i do assume two things: 1) active liquidators will rekt the accounts reasonably close to the 90% level and 2) there is a decent liquidity KMD/USDK market, better would be if USDK had liquid BTC and other markets

[13-Jul-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what the USSA tax consequences are for loaning coins to a blockchain

[13-Jul-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is better than a sale

[13-Jul-19 05:52 AM] damon#7265
Is it a Rolling 24 hour price or fixed at a certain time like GMT?

[13-Jul-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
rolling, using the 24hr SMA of the correlated price

[13-Jul-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the correlation adds a lot of random noise to the price to make it unpredictable and hard to manipulate, the 24hr SMA smooths it out

[13-Jul-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
to manipulate the price you would need to sustain it for 24hrs, which if you are doing that can be argued that the price actually did change

[13-Jul-19 05:54 AM] damon#7265
I wonder if there are any PUMPS or DUMPS that you could capitalize on 24 hours later?

[13-Jul-19 05:54 AM] damon#7265
Risky.. and, probably wouldn't break anything.

[13-Jul-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, if you can predict exact price movements, you can make a lot of money by loaning, paying back, etc.

[13-Jul-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
each loan is similar to selling KMD for stablecoin and redeeming like buying KMD for stablecoin

[13-Jul-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so this allows people to "trade" KMD against USD, without actually trading, certainly no KYC and maybe not even any change of ownership (unless liquidated)

[13-Jul-19 05:58 AM] damon#7265
yes, emulating USD, without actually buying USD which requires a Banking licenses and KYC, or without using Centralized PEGs.. It's a great idea, if someone can't break it..

[13-Jul-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and even without external markets, just being able to "buy" and "sell" KMD against USD to the blockchain seems a very useful way to hedge

[13-Jul-19 07:36 AM] damon#7265
Just to be certain....
Example: Komodo Current Value = $1.00 USD (easy math)
I lock-in 100 KMD for 80 KUSD (80%).
Komodo drops 11% and I'm now just below 90%.

Which scenario occurs?
Liquidators buy 80 KUSD and liquidate ALL of my KMD?
or
Liquidators buy a little KUSD, and I lose a little KMD at 10% penalty?

[13-Jul-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
Liquidators buy 80 KUSD and liquidate ALL of my KMD?

[13-Jul-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, you can add more KMD to your account to avoid being liquidated

[13-Jul-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to keep putting in KMD to stay at 89%

[13-Jul-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
going into the redzone is painful, in a decentralized way we rely on people to avoid being liquidated

[13-Jul-19 07:47 AM] damon#7265
Why can't you take just a little KMD to get it back to less than 90% ?

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
who is "you"?

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] damon#7265
Liquidator..

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
why would they bother to do it for just a small amount?

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] damon#7265
10%

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
?

[13-Jul-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the 10% is needed for reserve

[13-Jul-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so to keep the reserve, there would need to be just a very small liquidation, making it maybe not worth doing

[13-Jul-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and the system fundamentally relies on liquidators to actively liquidate all >90%

[13-Jul-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the user who is so leveraged is the one that needs to fix their account

[13-Jul-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
remember there is no interest being charged for the loan

[13-Jul-19 07:51 AM] damon#7265
I sure wouldn't want to be glued to my account every day, especially when 20% price change is normal for Crypto. Can there be  a delay mechanism??

[13-Jul-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
24 hr price moves slowly

[13-Jul-19 07:52 AM] damon#7265
Most people have jobs and sleep. I'd really think about how to take several small liquidations instead of taking it all at once..

[13-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
make more than one address then

[13-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
dont leverage more than 80%

[13-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
run a bot to replenish if it gets close to the liquidation

[13-Jul-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are making an issue due to assuming borrowers wont have sufficient tools

[13-Jul-19 07:54 AM] damon#7265
The system relies on people locking in - prior to people using KUSD and prior to Liquidators. A heavy penalty for not being glued to the Chain..

[13-Jul-19 07:54 AM] damon#7265
Yes.. I am assuming that..

[13-Jul-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the important thing is that the rules of the game combined with the ability for people to have automation creates a stable system

[13-Jul-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly without liquidation automation, there wont be timely liquidations

[13-Jul-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
similarily, without replenishment bots, accounts wont be replenished and be liquidated

[13-Jul-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
dont assume liquidators have bots and borrowers dont

[13-Jul-19 07:56 AM] damon#7265
Bots will be available for average user??

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
by "bot", if you mean a GUI that is running the logic of "if my balance goes above 85%, deposit X amount of KMD", then why not??

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] damon#7265
Built in to a wallet ??

[13-Jul-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i would expect a standalone GUI

[13-Jul-19 07:58 AM] damon#7265
Yea maybe that would work..

[13-Jul-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
let us work backwards from what is need to make this work. define it and then make the "bots"

[13-Jul-19 08:02 AM] damon#7265
Seems like you'd get more people locking in KMD for KUSD, if it wasn't a full liquidation. Very Risky for people who only look at prices once a day..

[13-Jul-19 08:02 AM] damon#7265
or only at a computer once a day..

[13-Jul-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
80% loans are indeed pretty risky, 50% loans not so much

[13-Jul-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
24hr price would take 12+ hrs to change even if a 30% instant price drop without recovery

[13-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be like with standard systems where a flash crash wipes out your positions

[13-Jul-19 08:07 AM] damon#7265
It's a bit like Leveraged Derivatives... If your leveraged 5X, and the price drops - look out..

[13-Jul-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[13-Jul-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
5x leverage combined with 20% drop...

[13-Jul-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
dont do it and ignore it

[13-Jul-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
!

[13-Jul-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
50% loan is much less stress, especially using daily price

[13-Jul-19 08:08 AM] damon#7265
Some people want to do 1X and ignore it for a week or two.. Slow position trading over weeks..

[13-Jul-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, 50% or even less should allow this, unless the price crashes by over 50% for over a day

[13-Jul-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if we can allow people to take risks, not monitor and have them protected from catastrophic market actions

[13-Jul-19 08:14 AM] damon#7265
Sure.. You can NOT market to those who want slower, less risky, trades.. Keep to those who are dedicated to it every day..
