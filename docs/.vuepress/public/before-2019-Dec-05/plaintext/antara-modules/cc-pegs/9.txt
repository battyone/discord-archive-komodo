@allbits#8882   Demurrage  and interest are not equivalent .

[24-Oct-19 05:27 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Interest rate is charge on principal. You are not paying 50% of your principal.  Additionally locking coins up in a peg necessarily prevents them from being able to the required action to receive the reward

[24-Oct-19 08:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
@eBit If I may add (I haven't read the whole conversation) to answer your question. When you deposit the funds in pegscc account, let say your example of 3000KMD, you are able to get up to 80% of value of your deposit at that moment. So if price of gold is 1500 KMD (we will avoid USD as JL mentioned we can have direct price but lets say 1 KMD 1$ so if 1500$ is the price of gold then lets say at that moment price of gold in KMD is 1500), you can get maximum 1.6 KGOLD. Again let take your example that you took 1 KGOLD, now the price went up, if you want to get back to KMD, you will get back your deposit so 3000KMD there is no 900KMD.
PegsCC must be looked as a mechanisom of deposit vs. borrow. You give the bank your house and take 200k$ loan, when you return the loan you get back the house.

[24-Oct-19 08:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
So you are not making any money with just holding KGOLD or whatever pegged coin, but you can lose money 😛

[24-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Mihailo#5902
On the other hand if you acquire more KGOLD, then you can exchange it for more tokens.

[24-Oct-19 09:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
The problem gose when price goes down. If it goes up you can always take more KGOLD if you want (not necessary). But if it goes down, then you would need to return, but instead of making a system which would burn coins and take it from users, this system works that someone can repay your debt and take your deposit. Then you are left with your KGOLD and you can exchange it for KMD, but you lost some of it as now the price is lower and you cannot get as much as you deposited.

[24-Oct-19 09:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
It is very confusing and complex at beginning, but when you grasp the fundamentals then everything is logical.

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Gotta put into perspective that KGOLD will be swappable in atomicDEX

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So for user friendliness if you want KGOLD you could just buy some

[24-Oct-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. the issuance/liquidation process is not anything most people have to do. once it is put into circulation, it should trade at close to the pegged value

[24-Oct-19 02:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
Someone needs to deposit in order for coins to be issued. But you can always just buy coins regularly. I think most of the people which will make deposits, they will do the liquidation part for profit. Others will regularly use the coins.

[24-Oct-19 05:28 PM] allbits#5898
@polycryptoblog demurrage?? Not sure you're using the right terminology, so your point is lost if you have one. Opportunity cost is cost. I think it's silly to hope nobody would take the opportunity cost Into account when locking KMD

[24-Oct-19 06:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Demurrage = fee for storage .   Interest = payment from borrower on and above the amount borrowed .          How do you figure you are paying a 50% interest rate on a 10:1 peg?

[24-Oct-19 06:51 PM] allbits#5898
Opportunity cost. It's very simple - I feel like you're being willfully blind to a simple point. I have 100 kmd. If I lock it for a year, I forgo about 5% = 5  kmd

If I borrow the equivalent of 10 kmd for that period (the ten percent example) I'm incurring a cost of 5 to borrow 10. There it is. Nothing to do with inaccurately applied terms like demurrage.  Just a simple cost benefit analysis like most normal people would do here.

[24-Oct-19 07:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok I get what you mean now,  by your description , interest is also an inaccurate term as well.   Opportunity cost != interest

[24-Oct-19 07:15 PM] allbits#5898
The effect is the same. Presenting this as interest free loan is misleading

[24-Oct-19 07:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If the deposit was not KMD ,  which is possible by cc-peg , then is it misleading?

[24-Oct-19 07:20 PM] allbits#5898
If the deposited coin is a coin that does not have rewards built in, it is quite different.

[24-Oct-19 07:21 PM] allbits#5898
There is slippage or inefficiency when setting up this system with KMD because the rewards "disappear"

[24-Oct-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the cc-pegs is implemented as interest free loan, it is coin agnostic. the fact that if using KMD has an opportunity cost is independent of the cc-pegs

[24-Oct-19 07:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s what I was trying to get at thanks @jl777c

[24-Oct-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but for KMD, which is the coin that makes sense to use, it does have a cost of the lost rewards, which is very real for people that actively collect rewards (about half). the upside is that these rewards can go toward compensating the multisig signers

[24-Oct-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that makes it a sustainable setup and for shorter term usage, the 0.4% per month is really smaller than most spreads, so shouldnt be much of a factor

[24-Oct-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is fair to describe cc-pegs as being similar to an interest free loan, we just need to explain that if KMD is used, the rewards are going to the multisig signers

[24-Oct-19 07:30 PM] allbits#5898
pegs on mBTC might be more attractive for long term - interest free loan on my btc by first converting it to the mBTC chain that you are setting up.

[26-Oct-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what setup i need to have on the KMD chain to bind gateways?

gateways are on smartchains

[26-Oct-19 12:45 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if doing kmd peg, need kmd funds.

[26-Oct-19 12:45 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cant put gateway on kmd chain tho

funds on the same pubkey as in the smartchain, right?

[26-Oct-19 12:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
there is a z_sendmany tx to deposit. one of the reciepient addresses is gateway, other address' pubkey needs to be one smartchain is launched with to claim

Reading up/catching up, but maybe not far enough - sounds like this is effectively live? Using the commands outlined here: https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/wiki/Pegs-CC I can actually take out a loan, backed with Komodo, today?

this is my pegsaddress output. Since i did the pegsfund `mybalance` has been rising slowly any particular reason why its done bit by bit and not completely on one move?

[28-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
Don't look at pegsaddress at all. You don't need it. And I haven't still modified pegsaddress to have what it needs.

Maybe you are using the same node for testing as that for the signer node (where oraclefeed is ran). Because in that case you will have the balance change when oraclesdata is done

[28-Oct-19 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it does look like i managed to fund the peg ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=KGOLDTEST pegsinfo ee6089e938a46ef88702d364d3b352f0a263e3e25947d64dd0de9b22541f6f6b

[28-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes you managed to fund it. So you have done deposit and claim successfuly

[28-Oct-19 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, the address is owned by both nodes.

[28-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Mihailo#5902

[28-Oct-19 01:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
Don't do that!!!

[28-Oct-19 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but one is running with gatway pubkey and the other with the recipients address pubkey

[28-Oct-19 01:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
It is not wrong, but you want be able to tell the difference.

[28-Oct-19 01:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
As oraclenodes need some coins in order to work. But for testing you should have clean piubkey with no funds.

[28-Oct-19 01:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
That way you will be able to test it correctly

[28-Oct-19 01:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
on one node i have the total balance of KGOLD. on the other i have only tokens i got from pegs fun.

[28-Oct-19 01:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
one of the nodes dont own the gatwways pubkey

[28-Oct-19 01:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, and on that node which have tokens you don't have any coins?
