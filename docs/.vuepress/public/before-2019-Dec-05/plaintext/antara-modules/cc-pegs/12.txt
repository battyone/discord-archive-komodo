@Mihailo what to check for this error?
```

  "result": "error",
  "error": "burntxid didnt validate!"
}
```

[29-Oct-19 01:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
check debug.log or console

[29-Oct-19 01:22 PM] SHossain#0007
this is the burntxid

[29-Oct-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
`claimaddr.RTQ7GDHsnHZ4njDbTjUnmm8GCkRhjifFES != destpubaddr.`

[29-Oct-19 01:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
give me claim command

[29-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think you have put address instead of pubkey in destpub parameter

[29-Oct-19 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...i know

[29-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
destpub, name tells for itself destination pubkey 😄

[29-Oct-19 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i had exact similar issue the other day

[29-Oct-19 01:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[29-Oct-19 01:27 PM] SHossain#0007
it would be less confusing if you would change that to `destpubkey` 🙂

[29-Oct-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
`pubkey` & `pubaddr` are kinda uniformed everywhere in the ecosystem

[29-Oct-19 01:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
I did as matter of fact, but did not push changes yet

[29-Oct-19 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007

The first doc for importgateway testing (WIP) https://gist.github.com/himu007/5b61ebb330ee46c4c1f7518d34e30d42
@Paro i removed the ufw commands that you added as for test machine with test funds, it wouldn't be big risk. but, kept the swap file creation and usage part. please let me know if you really want the ufw part back in there, i'll add it.
Thanks to @Mihailo @dimxy @jl777c for all the hard work they put inside.

this command doesn't return anything. wouldn't it be good to display something like `Invalid coin.` or `Coin is not on list.` or `Not a valid coin ticker. Please try again with the right ticker.`

@Mihailo please let me know which calls are needed to withdraw funds from importgateway.

[29-Oct-19 07:52 PM] SHossain#0007
Once i get the withdraw completed, i can update the gist

[29-Oct-19 07:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain, you just need to create withdraw tx, then oraclefeed do the rest

[29-Oct-19 07:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
And you should get the funds to pubkey you set in withdraw, on your external chain address

[29-Oct-19 07:53 PM] SHossain#0007
`importgatewaywithdraw` completed. i have the txid `dd691b85e26ff976d7107b0fd63bf1d20e03d665aede34c9ab4a1941a689d0ee`

[29-Oct-19 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
so, maybe i have to wait 100 blocks

[29-Oct-19 07:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
So check in next few blockc on MBTCTEST if you got it on KMD.

[29-Oct-19 07:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
No, you need to wait few blocks for signing and actual withdraw.

[29-Oct-19 07:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
But it is little bit more complicated as oraclefeed will execute withdraws only when posting KMD block data to oracle so if it is waiting a new block on kmd nothing will happen until new block comes.

[29-Oct-19 07:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
I wanted to decouple this but never got to do it...

[29-Oct-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007

Where does liquidity come from in this system? In the scenario where one deposits 100 usd worth of Kmd, withdrawing 80 kUSD, is AtomicDEX initially the only place to trade it for other assets, or will there be a way to redeem the kUSD for Komodo through/from the peg reserves?

[30-Oct-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you can redeem the USDk at anytime via the blockchain

[30-Oct-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the liquidity is created in a decentralized way. anybody can decide to create new stablecoins

[30-Oct-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, you can just buy it via atomicDEX, also working on getting a fiat conversion for the USDk, but that is full of external issues.

[30-Oct-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
since the USDk is fully backed by KMD in the reserves, we expect it to trade very close to $1. Certainly short term supply/demand imbalances can change the price a bit. in fact, this is what i expect will motivate people to create new stablecoins, the fact that it is trading at a slight premium that can then be arbitraged

[30-Oct-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no central bank

[30-Oct-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
in a way, it is a decentralized central banking function of creating new stablecoins

[30-Oct-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and the supply is removed in a way that is also decentralized, i envision it like mining where at risk accounts are liquidated for profit by the liquidators. to do this they will need a supply of stablecoins

[30-Oct-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also, to avoid being liquidated, users would have a demand for KMD and the stablecoin to move their account away from the at risk border. to allow redeems at anytime, accounts that are not above the 90% can be used as the source. but in this case they wont lose any equity as it is done at the current price. it might be a bit confusing when the details of the account changes from this external redeem, so we will need a good GUI for it.

[30-Oct-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be very interesting to see how USDk trades in the open market

@SHossain It seems that you either supplied wrong destination pubkey or something else is wrong...

[30-Oct-19 09:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
This is what I get for pubkey when I decode opret in withdraw tx: `ff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

[30-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
I should add to validation check of the pubkey, if it is not valid then it should reject tx.

[30-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I found what may cause wrong pubkey...

[30-Oct-19 11:17 AM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain I may need to invalidate a block where your withdraw tx is, and continue a new chain from there....

[30-Oct-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[30-Oct-19 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
Sure. No worries

[30-Oct-19 11:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@Mihailo i used the R address to withdraw the deposit. `RWzux9j8EhYb85E7xoH18BcP1fRyDPYWYL` this is the address it was originated from

[30-Oct-19 11:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
Again, you need to use pubkey!
