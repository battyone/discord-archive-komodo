Yes, that will make it work

[02-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Mihailo#5902
But let see first

[02-Nov-19 12:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ah sorry, 0.05 will work

[02-Nov-19 12:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
0.1 won't

[02-Nov-19 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
if 0.05 works. my next test would be try to withdraw more than the gateway has

[02-Nov-19 12:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, that won't work, but we can fix it by adding more funds to gateway address

[02-Nov-19 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll add 1 KMD there after these tests

[02-Nov-19 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
shouldn't MTBCTEST chain stop me from trying to withdraw more than the gateway has?

[02-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
```not enough funds to create withdraw tx
couldnt create rawtx or find previous partial signed tx

[02-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
As I mentioned, MBTCTEST doesn't know how much there is on gateways address

[02-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
as that is on KMD

[02-Nov-19 01:08 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @SHossain , thanke!  Yes, I'm interested to see if I can set something up.
Found the Pegs wiki, import-gateway wiki and your import-gateway doc so far.  Will read.

@SHossain The disk on my local node seems to be dying. I have 3 vps nodes, 2 I'm using for USDK, and 1 for MBTC. Can I get another VPS node to move MBTC from my local node?

[03-Nov-19 01:32 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. yes.

[03-Nov-19 01:33 PM] SHossain#0007
i can use one of my dedicated server to run MBTCTEST chain.

[03-Nov-19 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
will prepare the server soon with your repo

[03-Nov-19 02:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmm, I haven't written the private key of that node no where.

Hi, I'm reading up on pegged/stable coins and have a question about Pegs.
Will the funds that accumulate in the Pegs CC global reserve be able to collect the KMD 5.1% rewards?

[04-Nov-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that will fund the multisig operators, so this is a sustainable model

are you not using SSD?

[04-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I'm using SSD. That's why it is strange

[04-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
It could be that SSD is failing

[04-Nov-19 01:12 PM] SHossain#0007
Samsung 860 Pro or Sandisk 3D SSD are good ones

[04-Nov-19 01:13 PM] SHossain#0007
Intel makes good SSD too. But I used only one of their DC level SSD

[04-Nov-19 01:30 PM] Paro#7842
@Mihailo I had also had the same problem.  Ram min 8 gb, 2 CPU, It is sufficient. After waiting 20 minutes, the installation will begin.

i have Mihailo's setup ready in my server

[04-Nov-19 02:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c What do you think that we add the balance of deposit address to be submitted in oracle when submitting block data, so that on gateways chains we can check if the withdraw is possible?
As for now this cannot be done on AC because AC does not have any info on external deposit address balance. The only point that works with both chains is oraclefeed, but then you have already made the withdraw tx and if it is impossible it will basically block withdraw (as we have single withdraw limitation for the problem of creating raw tx in the same time)

[04-Nov-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
sure that and whatever other data makes it easier can be added to what the oracle needs to be writing out.

[04-Nov-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe try to get a `gdb` backtrace?

[04-Nov-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we dont need to support mining on special nodes?

[04-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
It seems the wallet had some tx that node couldn't mine

[04-Nov-19 05:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
I removed it and now it works ok

[05-Nov-19 01:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c On KMD chains we have getaddressbalance (if address index is turned on). But on other chains like BTC we don't have that method. I want to add balance of deposit address to oracle for gateways so looking how to check address balance.

[05-Nov-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not built into BTC, would need to use and external service (like explorer) as a data source, or a list of txids/value

[05-Nov-19 04:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
so there is no way to check the address balance from cli?

[05-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
Even if that address is in the wallet. Because I'm adding multisig address to wallet!

[05-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
I know I can use listaddressgroupings, but wanted to see if there is a better way

[05-Nov-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe if you added the multisig address as a watch-only address you can getbalance for it, at least a listunspent with that address, but not sure if BTC will consider a msig address as part of any specific wallet

[05-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
listunspent can be done, and I can sum all unspents

[05-Nov-19 04:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe the msig address can be imported with a label and then I can use getbalance "label"

[05-Nov-19 04:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
In BTC you cannot supply label/account for getbalance:
```Arguments:
1. dummy                (string, optional) Remains for backward compatibility. Must be excluded or set to "*".
2. minconf              (numeric, optional, default=0) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.
3. include_watchonly    (boolean, optional, default=false) Also include balance in watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')
```

[05-Nov-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
labels are mostly if not totally deprecated

[05-Nov-19 04:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, in KMD we have accounts but here I cannot getbalance for "account"

[05-Nov-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
listunspents for address seems the best

[07-Nov-19 02:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I'm finishing the balance in oracle for gateways. I have a doubt what would be the best way to choose right balance when you have n signers submitting balance and it differs. Should I take what n/2 says it is or should I go with min or max balance? Every option has its disadvantages...

[07-Nov-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
n/2 seems good as those are the signers

[07-Nov-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
OK, so I'm thinking if it is possible that n/2 hasn't yet got the info that balance has changed (for example after n/2 submits the balance on one node that is not one of n/2 nodes some withdraw is broadcasted on external chain and reduces balance) and in this way it allows the withdraw to be created but there is not enough funds now and that will basically make the iwthdraw process stuck!

[07-Nov-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
after the pending withdraw confirms, will it resolve?

[07-Nov-19 03:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, pending withdraw will "never" confirm if there is not enough funds to execute it. It can only resolve if  more funds are deposited.

[07-Nov-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but if n/2 agreed on balance, the balance would be there?

[07-Nov-19 03:13 PM] Mihailo#5902
So that withdraw will stay pending until there is enough funds available and block any other withdraw. That is the disadvantage of single withdraw system, and we made it like that as there was a problem of creating parallel withdraws as when creating raw tx it uses unspents but before previous withdraw is not finished the utxos stay unspent.

[07-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, that was my point. What if n/2 submitted one balance, and then after that moment balance changed and the next submit is not yet on the way. So the balance would be incorrect.

[07-Nov-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but the balance can only go up?

[07-Nov-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so wouldnt there be enough funds to do the withdraw

[07-Nov-19 03:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
Deposit address balance goes up and down. It goes up when people deposit coins, and down when they iwthdraws. So if there is a situation I mentioned, then the withdraws would be stuck, and balance would go up only when someone deposits and then withdraws can continue.

[07-Nov-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to be able to force cancel a pending withdraw in such a case?

[07-Nov-19 03:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
We can make that, but then the gateway mechanism distance more from the decentralized principe of working as you can cancel withdraws from central point.

[07-Nov-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is only valid after a full day, it seems ok as under normal condition withraws are processed much faster than a day

[07-Nov-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a withdraw request is only good for a day (or some shorter time limit)

[07-Nov-19 04:00 PM] SHossain#0007
12 hours?

[07-Nov-19 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
We can make that withdraw request expires. It would solve that withdraws is not indefinetely stuck.
I would be satisfied the most if I could solve the parallel withdraw issue and then we don't care if somebody created the withdraw that is not possible. We can make it expire at some point. It would also make withdraws fast as you won't need to wait for your withdraw to get at top of the queue...

[07-Nov-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i assume we can solve parallel withdraws later?

[07-Nov-19 04:48 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think so, just saying that maybe it is better to invest time to solve it now then to fix the issues of single withdraw.

[07-Nov-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
true, but having a withdraw expire after a long time, seems a good thing in any case

[07-Nov-19 04:53 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, agree. I mentioned it up there.
