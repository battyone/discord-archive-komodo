@Deleted User how does Coda compare to Grin/MimbleWimble? It seems they both desire to have very small blockchains, but I am not sure how either work internally much

[20-Dec-18 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
the Pascal coin also claims to have some kind of constant-sized blockchain

So a CodaCC would have a blockchain remain the same size? I could see that being the standard for any games with their own chain.

[05-Apr-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it achieves this by not storing the tx except locally, so it wont allow others to validate past tx

[05-Apr-19 03:44 PM] Regnar#6164
ohh. Okay that makes sense

Hi @jl777c,
I'd like to introduce @o1christine from the Coda project.  She has some questions.

[15-Oct-19 02:36 PM] CrisF#3405

Hi all! @CrisF told me about the Komodo project and that you were exploring interoperability between Coda and Komodo. I am the community manager at O(1) Labs, the team building Coda. Feel free to let me know how we can help you, I will be here as a resource to help out, and we appreciate your feedback!

[15-Oct-19 02:48 PM] o1christine#8079
We are also hosting a zk-SNARKs workshop together with Vitalik Buterin during San Francisco Blockchain Week. Maybe it will be interesting for folks here to get some hands-on experience on zk-SNARKs technology. We have some early bird tickets and student tickets as well http://bit.ly/SFBWZKP

I'm not sure how much farther things progressed than what was discussed in #ask-jl777 and here, so jl777 is the person to ask.

[15-Oct-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@ca333 maybe an update can be posted?

[15-Oct-19 03:31 PM] ca333#0118 (pinned)
sure - @Mihailo @Champii  can you please post the current status report into this channel. 

We recently added a new RPC call to Komodo at Champiis request. This additional method should be the last outstanding method to finalise the whole burn process on the coda side. Afaik Champii already joined the code-discord and exchanged with you there.

Speaking technically @o1christine - our devs @Mihailo and @Champii have already successfully executed CODA<->KMD cross-chain operations! The modified CODA codebase for the KMD-interoperability is in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coda - the Komodo side of things should be in https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/tree/coda - our devs will provide you further details and infos. And thanks for joining the dev talk!

you re very welcome @o1christine - it is a pleasure to have you here - thanks!

[15-Oct-19 03:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
@o1christine Hi and welcome! Regarding our progress on Coda<->Komodo interoperability, last that I didnwas to make an rpc that burns coins on kmd side (when you want to exit kmd chain and import on coda chain), and an rpc that creates a marker on kmd side so that you can mark a burn completed when import is done on cods side.

[15-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think @Champii is finalizing it, so he can report on current status.

[15-Oct-19 04:00 PM] o1christine#8079
@Mihailo that's cool! Do I understand correctly that what you're trying to do is to enable moving tokens between independent blockchains ?

[15-Oct-19 04:01 PM] o1christine#8079
what would be the ideal end result if we achieve KMD-CODA interoperability ?

[15-Oct-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we are implementing a dual-daemon solution to create a new chain

[15-Oct-19 04:09 PM] Mihailo#5902
@o1christine Yes, if by tokens you mean coins, as on KMD tokens is also a separate thing. Basically you could run Coda chain and a KMD Coda asset chain and move coins between them easily. I think the end result would be that you could use features from both worlds (Coda and KMD) and you can go to KMD Code chain and use any of the Antara modules (crypto conditions) and then go back to Coda and have a small print chain.
But I would suggest that you talk to @jl777c about possibilities as it is his idea initially!

[15-Oct-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so each side is a 1:1 chain to the other side, the coin emission needs to be balanced between block production on each side. this allows a coda tech based chain that has a built in 1:1 komodo protocol chain

[15-Oct-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
one advantage is that it would allow all the existing exchanges to be able to immediately integrate it without any additional customizations, as the komodo protocol side is standard bitcoin rpc

[15-Oct-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and the people who are using the coin would migrate the coins over to the coda side. so the traditional side will also get all the antara modules available, and that would allow a dual-daemon chain to have literally thousands of different instantiations. you could make a stablecoin backed by KMD and able to be 1:1 migrated automatically to the coda side.

[15-Oct-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
if the coin emissions side can be managed, a BTC pegged chain can also be created, that has the coda tech that people can use it with. i hope you can see the spectrum of possibilities, basically unlimited.

[15-Oct-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be the most powerful usecase is for massive scaling, so the coin emissions are done on the komodo side and then the actual high volume usage on the coda side. that means the blockchain side will stay constant regardless of the number of transactions

just one of many antara modules that can be activated in the dual-daemon coda chain

[15-Oct-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
these chains would not be the main CODA (or KMD) chain, but a new chain that projects would launch

This is exactly the kind of thing that is being asked for and dreamed of by big business and so many projects. 

All the devs and fintech people I've been meeting are disappointed with ETH based products.

They all have high hopes for it because they think it is the cutting edge, and they want the dream of workable blockchain solutions.

It is frustrating to see the presentations on the state of their tech and know I got to test that in Labs a year ago.

2 of the presentations I saw last night were projects on their way back from Devcon in Osaka.  Their newest tech and roadmap have been done or possible to do on Komodo for years. 

There were some good questions and discussion about ETH 2.0.  The feeling from all sides was it will be anything from a giant mess to total chaos.

you're working on interesting stuff! In a multi-chain future, cross-chain interactions will be very usefull. Antara modules sound interesting as well, I will need to read more into it to understand how it exactly works

[18-Oct-19 04:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @o1christine,
Multi-chain and cross-chain aren't the future, they're pretty old news ;)
We've been using that for over a year now.

Hi @pranay üëã

Please ask here if you have any questions.  I'm sure @jl777c and the other devs would be happy to answer.

Great possibilities using the dual-daemon approach.  Especially considering all the params the chain would have to choose from.

Wonder how complicated it would get to add an additional daemon or more...

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, idea or explainers, or built something cool for Coda, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page.
