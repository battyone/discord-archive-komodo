ok

[09-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, this is mostly for instant payments, and while it can be combined in some scenarios, it can be difficult to accomplish this

[09-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Well, for now it is a single CC

[09-Nov-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can add token sending via channels, then people can channel send tokens that represent, whatever the tokens represent

[09-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[09-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
can you please describe for me the general flow of using channels?

[09-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
for example, you create a channel with the `rpccall` method,

then you X with `rpccall`,

then X with `rpccall`,

and once the txid enters the mempool, the payment can be considered spent

[09-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and anything about withdrawing from the cc or ending it, etc.

[09-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
This is the regular flow of using channel:
```
Channel create: channelsopen destination_public_key number_of_payments payment_amount - this creates a channel between the one creating channel and the destination public key with number of payments defined of certain denomination.
Example: channesopen 025d2c1b95cd6e49ca2159ed58ef748a52c90efb2509d174c091328713388b6e3a 100 10000 - will create a channel with 100 payments of 10k satoshi - in total 0.01 coin.

Channel payment: channelspayment open_tx_id number_of_pyaments_released - this will send the specified amount to receiver
Example channelspayment 636318273631cb3d205bde25bcf0cf3137984e2b866c3aa879040f906fb47c3b 10 - will send 100k satoshi to receiver.
```

[09-Nov-18 04:27 PM] TonyL#3577
With responses examples

[09-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Perfect

[09-Nov-18 04:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
Now when the sender does not want to have the funds in a channel anymore (want to withdraw them and use them anywhere else) he needs to close the channel and after channel close is notarized he can retreive the funds. This is important to show the recevier that the channel will be closed and it won't receive new funds anymore.
```
Channel close: channelsclose open_tx_id - it will close the channel

Channel refund: channelsrefund open_tx_id close_tx_id - this will retreive funds from channle adress back to creators pubkey address, but only after close is notarized
```

[09-Nov-18 04:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
You have also channel info to list all the available channels in which you are involved, and to get specific info for particular channel:
```
Channel info: channelsinfo - will list all the channels available and their open_tx_id
channelsinfo open_tx_id - will list info for that particular channel
```

[09-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, great. 

I think I can work with all of this. Will let you know when I have more questions. Thank you both.

Will have a try again later.

@CrisF Komodo even maybe installed on different server - since app working via RPC - just connection needed to be manually hardcoded atm (https://github.com/tonymorony/trollbox_gui#rpc-connection)
Hmm try something like a  `sudo apt-get install libmtdev1`
I've tried only on 18.04

One which I used before (https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc) seems tricky somewhere and losing RPC connection after X seconds of inactivity - so not recommended to use ))

@TonyL I have fixed oracle (I think üòÉ ) so you can start testing it. I think previous created oracles can be used. But this fix is a hardfork change because there is change in validation so you must update all nodes.

Seems problem is on my UTXO generator side. Batch of oraclessubscribes generating but not sending now straight

[15-Nov-18 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
There is some strange behaviour in general - part of sending transactions just disappear  and not coming mempool(seems that's why UTXO generator getting txids but these transactions not coming to mempool and publisher funds not increasing)
Like a on screenshot - was broadcasted data for 1098079 - 1098085 heights

do you wait until a tx is in the mempool before sending the next one?

[15-Nov-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
unlike dice, with oracles it is important to get each one in the mempool

Is oraclefeed waiting for it?

mempool usage is always a bit unreliable. but not even checking if it got into your own mempool is guaranteeing your nodes idea of current state will be different than what it actually is

[15-Nov-18 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
oraclefeed printing some txids but there is no such transactions on chain (and don't see any printouts why it's not getting to mempool)

[15-Nov-18 12:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL maybe you can hold on testing 2of3 gateway as I have an update for that that I will submit very soon. So you can then test gateway completley. I would focus on this oracle fix to check that everything works correctly.

[15-Nov-18 12:21 PM] TonyL#3577
It was an interesting network issue - firewall blocking rules allowed to synch the chain but didn't allow to interact with mempool for a 3 nodes from 5 in chain.

@TonyL @jl777c Do we have some special defines in code for testing purposes? I was thinking for the function that will check if tx is notarized/confirmed it will be very long to wait for 60 confirms or notarization so we can lower the number just in testing. Do we have some mechanism already?
