[18-Jul-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I am starting to experiment with CC and see what I can make it do. not 100% sure yet, but I think I might have written a utxo based assets system. All you can do is create and transfer assets, but it is divisible to the satoshi, whatever amount was used to create it. this is only core level support, so would need to have the asset tx creation made easy, but so far it seems very very extensible. If you have a smart contract use case, plz post here and I will see how much work it would be to implement

[18-Jul-18 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
actually libscott wrote 200 lines of code to implement a basic colored coin implementation and I just morphed it a bit to leverage the built in utxo system. still need to make the wallet know about asset utxo

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[18-Jul-18 02:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so we could have blockchains with their own coin, and Kmd as an asset on them

[18-Jul-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I would love for this to be possible. Me and my friend were discussing a game, where you have items and a crypto to trade said items, being able to transfer items across blockchains would allow that to scale to infinity. The items would be something like crypto kitties, but weapons and armour etc, that you can upgrade, each being totally unique.

[18-Jul-18 02:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've been thinking about this for a while, a way to entice small coins (and some not so small ones) to join Kmd ecosystem. They could fork to an assetchain importing their current utxo, and at the time same work as a "transport layer" for kmd as a colored coin on top of them

[18-Jul-18 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it costs the native coin to issue the colored coins

[18-Jul-18 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can interpret each satoshi to represent a different amount, ie. change the decimals resolution, so 1 COIN would support 1 million assets with 0.01 resolution (as there are 100 million satoshis in 1.00000000)

I would think a dedicated blockchain for a specific game would be able to handle its usage

[18-Jul-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that would be fine to really. As the blockchain would really only need transactions for trading or when an item is created/upgraded. Even with millions of users, it would probably handle the load.

[18-Jul-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is you should be able to add arbitrary data to the asset creation via opreturn

encoded into each asset creation.

[18-Jul-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
for now an asset is divisible to the satoshi, but I guess if you created it with 0.00000001 native coins, it cant be divided

regtest is a fairly new feature added.

and cos a friendly quote says `since we have regtest, we can write new KMD-specific tests that make sure KMD features work correctly/etc` - which is a good way to get new devs familiar with code, writing tests for them.   plus we inherit a whole bunch of zcash testing.

and when dockerized, lowers barriers for devs to d/l in their sanctioned environments.

How is the underlying chain txfees be paid when tokens move on a cc smart contract?

[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] allbits#5898
Another possible simple and fun proof of concept contract idea would be an actual ponzi that returns 100% of "invested" funds. So if you put a unit in, then you get in line to receive two units that are "invested" after you

[20-Jul-18 09:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers talking about the assets/tokens made on cc enabled assetchain?

[20-Jul-18 09:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[20-Jul-18 09:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those coloured coins as I understand works same as we experienced the NXT's Asset Exchange tokens.

[20-Jul-18 09:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's correct and my understanding is fine, then every coloured token tx will cost the underlying assetchain tx fee.

[20-Jul-18 09:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which in the case of 100m per 1 underlying coin will make it impossible to move just one token

[20-Jul-18 09:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I would say that one token is 0.00011000 of the underlying coin

[20-Jul-18 09:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That way each token has its own txfee to be moved

[20-Jul-18 09:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But then it could be moved just once?

[20-Jul-18 10:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
think it's good to get this cleared by @jl777c üôÇ

[21-Jul-18 03:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@siu - Chainmakers As far as I get it,   after coloring, the coins gain new intrinsic value that wasn't there before. So 1 colored coin, even if it is created using 1 sat of the parent chain, doesn't mean its value is 1 sat of the parent chain forever.  As there are other factors that influence its value come into play, it will be worth it to pay the txfee in terms of the parent chain to move even 1 colored coin. (All of the above is similar to using ETH to pay for transacting ERC20 s). A simpler example would be like bitcoins from the genesis block that were mined by satoshi himself. If they were to be sold, they would presumably go for a high premium. Also `untainted` bitcoins that were just mined can go for a premium over bitcoins that were involved with silkroad etc., so you can see a situation in which a colored coin on a ParentChain can have 1/10 th the value of the ParentChain coin if it the market forces decide it. So it would definitely be worth it to transact a single colored coin using 0.00011000 of the underlying coin as the tx fee.

[21-Jul-18 03:08 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't know how fractional colored coins would work, but I am sure it would be an interesting explanation.

[21-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Mylo#8306
creating 100m token from 1 coin means "cost price" is 1 sat per token at creation.
once you add value to the token, it will be worth more than 1 sat.
if you cannot make a token worth more than the tx fee, maybe it's not a good idea to make a token for whatever it represents?

[21-Jul-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
txfees are paid in the native coin

[21-Jul-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use 1 coin or a million to create the total assetoshis supply and make each 0.00000001 worth whatever you deem it to be. Once created, they cannot be destroyed and live on in a separate set of utxos. Ok, you can send to the null privkey address and that would burn it, but all operations preserve the total count of assets, normal utxo must be used for txfee

[21-Jul-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810

crypto explains a lot imo.  we have yet to answer lots of life questions but crypto probably has the answer.  maths isnt invented, it's discovered because it always existed - just our minds needed to find the questions and solutions.  it always has the answer given inputs.  and my hope is we prove that nobody ever "dies" through this immutable ledger tech.

the alt in me is taking a learning trip down the kinesiology path so i've learned recently from talking to ppl about it and am interested to learn more by checking it out.

what fascinates me about it - basically, if someone has a bad experience and bad memory - the practitioner basically "branches" from the event that forms the memory and asks the patient to create a new memory that would have been "better".

software mimics a lot of life, so i'm interested to know if the "branching" is indeed how i perceive it to be.

big bang - maybe thats the coinbase of this universe, parallel ones out there, just need the crypto conditions of astrophysics to be discovered.  üòÑ

It is still very new and rough and not much tested, but I have created assets, made and cancelled bids, even filled a bid. To fill an order, requires to have the txid of the bid or ask, but once that works I plan to make a price based buy/sell.

issue tokenaddress to find your address where the tokens will end up. you need to run with -pubkey=02... set to a valid pubkey. using the addressindex functions you can find your asset transactions. anyway, i will be going offline for a bit if you want to connect to a test chain: ./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=ASSETS -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<put a pubkey to an address inyour wallet> -addnode=5.9.102.210

@SHossain we will want to start making documentation for the above. please ask if anything is unclear. all the commands have a one line help that shows the parameters if you run it without any
