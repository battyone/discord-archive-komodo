help is dynamically generated, by looking for all defined RPCs

[26-Nov-18 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if it's not in help, are you sure you are running the latest binary? And you stopped and restarted the daemon since the last compile?

[26-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, done clean build, stopped the daemon and started again and still nothing.

[26-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm on correct binary

i am trying that 1 line diff on my pirate-komodo repo, to see what happens

This should populate the table with all the commands from vRPCCommands list.

[26-Nov-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup. But also, this code has done this kind of stuff to me many times

[26-Nov-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
especially if you don't know about the argument conversion list in a different file, it will give you errors about invalid arguments or stringify when you don't want it to

[26-Nov-18 04:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
this seems different

[26-Nov-18 04:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
What is also wierd is that on other nodes where I also used the same code (without tokenconvert in the list), I have it in komodo-cli help 😮

[26-Nov-18 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo you didn't restart komodod

if you don't restart komodod, you will get method not found

[26-Nov-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo maybe you are restarting wrong komodod

[26-Nov-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
must be SPLTEST, not any other AC or KMD komodod

[26-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahhhhhh, didn't supply AC name

[26-Nov-18 04:58 PM] Mihailo#5902

Thnx and sorry 😩

[26-Nov-18 04:58 PM] dukeleto#7326

[26-Nov-18 05:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
once you have 39 komodo repos on 57 servers with 99 AC running different versions, it can get complicated 😃

@jl777c i have a PR to fix that token RPC and fix a small test issue coming up

[26-Nov-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c do you prefer PR's to komodo that fix PirateChain things, or PR to piratechain and you cherry-pick things from that repo?

[26-Nov-18 05:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
our workflow is getting more complex, with these komodo forks

[26-Nov-18 05:02 PM] dukeleto#7326

[26-Nov-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker that is a big clue. maybe regtest creates some new epochid

ooooooh

[26-Nov-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
regtest might do some different stuff, i don't even know about epochid

@SHossain scrolling up, it seems we have a bug with `decoderawtransaction` ?

[26-Nov-18 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[26-Nov-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't show the xtn as "overwintered", and it should

[26-Nov-18 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
the tx version is 1,

[26-Nov-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
so we need to see, is the bug in createrawtransaction?

[26-Nov-18 05:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
decoderawtransaction is just decoding, the bug probably is earlier

[26-Nov-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
the original createrawtransaction from KMD, sounds like it didn't (correctly) learn the new changes to xtn version. Or something was undone/overwritten in the merge

[26-Nov-18 05:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can write a test for this

[26-Nov-18 05:27 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be nice. we are waiting for the fix

[26-Nov-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CCtx functions use the internal signtransaction

[26-Nov-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
which should automatically create sapling, but i didnt update the epoch stuff enough to trigger sapling tx

[26-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
this never worked before, so it couldnt have been broken

[26-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Nov-18 07:44 PM] Mihailo#5902 (pinned)
@TonyL I have submitted PR for gateways changes. So the flow for withdraw is changed but it considers only oraclefeed. Everything else done by the user stays the same. The thing is that now there is gatewaymarkdone tx which needs to be confirmed/notarized before the withdraw will be done on external chain. For single sig gateways it will be done right after withdraw tx, and with multisig after it is completley signed. Then after markdone is confirmed (in TESTMODE it is 2 blocks) oraclefeed will execute the withdraw on KMD. Also withdraw will not start until withdraw tx is confirmed.
To build daemon in test mode use:  `CONFIGURE_FLAGS='CPPFLAGS=-DTESTMODE' ./zcutil/build.sh -j8`
You can start testing single signature gaetway just to confirm everything is working good. And I think I'll have multisig tested tomorrow so you can then proceed with that too.

[26-Nov-18 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it is merged into FSM

@TonyL I'm glad that single sig gateway works. Can you try multisig also, as I couldn't test it yet?

[28-Nov-18 07:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
Used tokens are not burnt, they are put back in gateways pubkey address so they can be reused...

[28-Nov-18 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Hmm, so it should be a bug that `remaining` and `issued` remains the same after successful withdrawal

[28-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
Probably. I don't know how it was made in the beginning, it probably looks all time deposits but it should look how much is in the gateway pubkey address.

[28-Nov-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
updated FSM branch with support for creating sapling CC tx. @TonyL plz test all CC on a sapling active chain, each CMutableTransaction that is used must be explicitly enabled, so  it is possible for any CC tx to not be updated to version 4 (sapling) in which case it is invalid
