there is an qa/rpc-tests/addressindex.py but it hasn't been updated for KMD yet

[21-Nov-18 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
it uses lot of addresses and privkeys, which need to be converted to be valid on KMD, then those tests will probably work

At the moment bets on latest `jl777` seems kinda tricky, before there wasn't such behaviour:

It's pending for 10-15 seconds, then result can change on fly

So not sure how to fix auto-tests now because now dicestatus sometimes return loss on first call if bet actually won + very big timeout needed before `dicestatus` call

yes I see they both have too old commits

@TonyL FSM branch should be fixed. plz test with all the existing unit tests

[22-Nov-18 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Ok, will go ahead now. I've supposed to temporary disable part of dice tests (reported behaviour above)

[22-Nov-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
would be good to get a reproducible dice CC bug, then it could be fixed, but for now maximum coverage of all CC is the priority. we can drill down specific dice issues afterwards

On latest FSM auto-tests daemon crashing on initial 100 blocks generating stage, trying to collect information (on jl777 same tests passing)

So since all unit-tests using regtest mode with generate call it's not working at all atm

[22-Nov-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually seems for backtrace above daemon not crashed but hanged (all RPC calls hanging and it's totally unkillable - only reboot helped)

[22-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, no idea what is going wrong...

[22-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
does regtest mode work at all?

[22-Nov-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
It's work on `jl777`

[22-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully duke can fix regtest mode with the sapling merge

[22-Nov-18 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, if not - I have an idea to bootstrap 100 pre-generated blocks and give it to test nodes on each test execution. Not sure if this trick will work 🤔

[22-Nov-18 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
But in such non-regtest native mode everything will need a rework... Hope @dukeleto will save the world 🙌

[22-Nov-18 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
I've never understood the need for regtest unless you're trying to test KMD specific code

[22-Nov-18 12:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually that what unit-tests do - test specific KMD code

[22-Nov-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810

Faced strange behaviour in test framework for oraclecreate - can't create an oracle:
```
DEBUG:BitcoinRPC:-543-> oraclescreate ["Test", "Testing", "s"]
DEBUG:BitcoinRPC:<-543- {"result": "error", "error": "couldnt create oracle"}
```
And no any other printouts. But node have balance (checking it before this call). It's not reproducing outside of test framework so problem should be somewhere in tests

[23-Nov-18 02:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Seems my modifications for second node adding broke all non CC tests
https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/blob/FSM/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/util.py#L206 issue is in this place
For non CC tests nodes creating with different args and this `REGTEST.conf` working only for `cryptocondtions.py`

@dukeleto Could you please give the cue on which part of framework code stopping daemons from previous test / cleaning?

[23-Nov-18 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i don't quite understand your question

[23-Nov-18 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL one thing to note is that many test files did not pass before, and now may fail in different ways because of sapling

[23-Nov-18 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto At the moment if I run all tests - daemon/s started by previous tests not finishing/terminating automatically. So I guessed there is some part of framework code which should stop these daemons

[23-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Mylo#8306
@grewalsatinder there’s a python cc integration test suite started by @dukeleto

[23-Nov-18 07:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL if your daemon doesn't shut down correctly, that is a bug in your code

[23-Nov-18 07:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL it's happened to me as well, when the code that shuts down does not find the correct REGTEST.conf or doesn't get the correct CLI arguments

[23-Nov-18 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so with latest FSM, are there any reproducible CC bugs?

[23-Nov-18 07:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
wrong rpcport/etc

[23-Nov-18 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
or is it working as well as it did before sapling merge?

[23-Nov-18 07:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
I haven't noticed stuff but @TonyL has been doing more lately

[23-Nov-18 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i think i see why you broke non-CC tests

@TonyL soon, we will want to make our own additions to util.py, KMD flavored additions. Functions like `start_asset_chain()` and things like that, to abstract away all this extra_args uglieness

[23-Nov-18 09:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
we want to make our tests a joy to write and read. Once we have a few test files, we can see common patterns. Already with verushash.py and cryptoconditions.py, I can see how to write some convenience functions, so starting nodes is a few lines, instead of 50

@jl777c I not found any reproducible CC bugs on latests FSM so far
@dukeleto hmm but there wasn't any code which creating config in `start_node` before (https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/util.py#L196). In latest PR I just added condition to create custom config for `cryptoconditions.py` only if `cryptocondtions.py` extra_args noticed - this code shouldn't affect any previous.
Moreover I've tried to run non CC tests with daemon from latest FSM and old tests files before my changes and behaviour is the same.

I'm almost ready with app prototype but duplicate keys allows me to work with only last channel from list.

agreed, duplicate keys will cause many issues

@TonyL In channelsinfo there are no duplicate keys. The info is composed of cc address made of two pubkeys (sender and receiver), number of payments and channelopen txid. CC address is always the same between two same pubkeys, but open tx id is different for each channel. So unique indentifier for each channel is its open tx id.

Keys  (` "Channel"`) are duplicated - it's really quite big issue to work with

I can change the output of the json so that each channel i one json object. When I was making channel CC I aimed for the info to be nice in cmd so that user can see important info.

Oh you meant json keys. Ok, np.

[26-Nov-18 08:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
I'll make each channel one json object in array.

[26-Nov-18 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yeah, JSON keys, I'm sorry if I'm wasn't clear 😃
