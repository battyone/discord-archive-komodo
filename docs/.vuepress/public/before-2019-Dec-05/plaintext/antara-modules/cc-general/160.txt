if you die, you have n seconds to find keystrokes in which you don't die

[08-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Alright#0419
does that not sound like a fun game mechanic?

[08-Mar-19 08:16 AM] Mylo#8306
yes it does.  there'll be heaps of those though. and as jl says, it diminishes the playerdata market if you have chances-of-not-dying.

[08-Mar-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what is implemented now

just at 60 blocks to allow people an hour to finish a level

[08-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
there is a difference between a game where you attacked a monster and died and a game where you hit shift + Q

[08-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
gold

[08-Mar-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so when you die you get less gold?

[08-Mar-19 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is how like all rogue lilkes work

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Alright#0419
if you die as a non-cheater you get 0 gold. if you "die" as a cheater, you get the gold in your inventory

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I dkn, I played rogue port on mobile a lot and if you die you die

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
If warriors will not die whats the point to trade em

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not saying thats exactly how rogue works ... but modern games based on it... to leve the leve you usually commit suicide rather than travel all the way back to base

[08-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
what I'm suggesting, they still die

[08-Mar-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Why it's bad now?

[08-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
if you do not find inputs in n seconds that don't kill you

[08-Mar-19 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hwe figured out hwo to break it liek he does with everything üòÇ

[08-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Alright#0419
and this way, it's fair between cheaters and non-cheaters

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i plan to implement a way that doesnt allow not submitting keystrokes

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
assume that is the case, now how do you cheat?

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not breaking anything and it's not easy to save dead warrior even now

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
you submit winning keystrokes instead of losing keystrokes?

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
It's harder to save not dead warrior üòÇ

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Alright#0419
it all comes down to the timeframe in which a user has to do this

[08-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you make it sound so easy to not die

[08-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Alright#0419
not easy, but possible

[08-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Mylo#8306
games always have glitches

[08-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you have to publish keystrokes, how can you cheat

[08-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime publishing of keystrokes

[08-Mar-19 08:22 AM] Alright#0419
ok that works

[08-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how that is possible though

[08-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
realtime publishing and validating

[08-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
you publish your keystrokes to validator nodes in realtime

[08-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
my entire point is that if there are cheats possible because of the design, make the cheats available to everyone

[08-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
they need to then sign your keystrokes tx

[08-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Alright#0419
if this changes gameplay, so what

[08-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Mylo#8306
so many ways to solve this.... it wil be solved, just not today

[08-Mar-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the fix would be to change it so zombies are allowed

[08-Mar-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
we had that

[08-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but the realtime keystrokes validation is something that I plan to do, so not sure why you keep on about this

[08-Mar-19 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
```my entire point is that if there are cheats possible because of the design, make the cheats available to everyone``` - I'm not totally sure how to implement now godmode dying protection cheat at the moment. There is even no "death" keystroke. If you can implement such mechanim we can share it I wonder

[08-Mar-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
At the moment a lot of moments can be changed from sourcecode I wonder - like a weapon power, rng and etc. Maybe validation of hash-sum of rogue exectuable by comparing with one written in oracle can help

[08-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
if any element of RNG is left to the user to generate, I don't think this works

[08-Mar-19 08:34 AM] TonyL#3577
It will help to solve problems with `rogue` updating as well - if you not using consensus client now - you not able to play

[08-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
unless it's not actually random

[08-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
and based on some seed they agreed was actually the seed

[08-Mar-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm talikng about ingame pseudo-RNG which creating items, determinating hit-rate and etc

[08-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
are these are based on same inputs, same seed, same outcome?

[08-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
they are determined from the seed, yes?

[08-Mar-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the cheat would just be to restart level

[08-Mar-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
But if code will send trigger on start to BC and hashsum validation prevent source code modifications - it should help imo

[08-Mar-19 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's too complicated for this stage of project I thnk

[08-Mar-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
cant prevent modification of local code

[08-Mar-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes I have said 4 times, this issue is not for solving now

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
I trust that you know what you're doing. This all came about from brainstorming with joker on how to best design blockchain tetris

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
to prevent keystroke reorg level cheats, external observers are needed

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
I might not be able to write the literal code for these things, but i can  recognize a design trap when i see one

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
so i am trying to help him avoid these

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
to prevent keystroke reorg level cheats, external observers are needed

[08-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
not saying there is a current one

Will he write an article with your solution to blockchain based games?

[08-Mar-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
his point is that if you change the games balance by adding crypto, it could very easily break the game

[08-Mar-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i believe that

[08-Mar-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not a gamer, but i have heard people talk about "loot boxes" in games, where companies essentially make you pay for items in the game that are needed to play effectively. Some countries banned the practice, and the companies needed to rebalance the games to make them playable without buying essential items

[08-Mar-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think nobody has effectively integrated blockchains and games yet, but KMD is on the bleeding edge

[09-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I agree

[09-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
No one plays those play to win games anymore. New strategy is rare skins haha. Buy a box random skin. 1% legendary, 9% rare, 80% common etc. kids love that type of gambling

[09-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
They‚Äôve got steam where you can sell skins for money (non withdrawable) and buy new games or other skin games with it though a lot of games are cross platform, cross launcher etc so it‚Äôs not too useful

[09-Mar-19 04:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be good if there was a universal currency or more devs allowed for inter game items

[09-Mar-19 06:18 AM] joe2x4#5987
It would be interesting to allow a player to spend rogue to resurrect a dead player, within a short time frame. Similar to add more coins to continue.

[09-Mar-19 07:14 AM] gcharang#6833
The cost to resurrect can be based on the character's value and increase exponentially with time. This payment could be to the cc address that pays ROGUE for gold when bailout.

there might be a way to use diceCC for the RNG of lootboxes
just thinking aloud

sorry to butt in, but i have written a py-rpc for pirate that pulls rpc details from PIRATE.conf, but could easily be adapted for multiple coins if anyone is interested

CCcontract_info *cp

[17-Mar-19 02:55 AM] Mylo#8306
In English, if I‚Äôm reading code, does: cp = cryptocondition pointer, or contract pointer.  To the struct in memory.  Is that an accurate statement?

[17-Mar-19 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a pointer to a structure of variables in mempory

[17-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes thanks.
Is the convention used by the dev team to use the argument name ‚Äúcp‚Äù?

[17-Mar-19 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im trying to find where the structure is lol...

[17-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Mylo#8306
Also, what is  the naming convention nValue and nIn?

[17-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Mylo#8306
It holds the basic info of the CC

[17-Mar-19 03:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you an call anything whatever you want.... but I would advise (and what I try to do) is just use whatever is already being used by the existing code to make things easier to follow

[17-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Mylo#8306
I‚Äôm trying to establish the naming conventions and helper functions for docs.   Yes 100% agree

Yeah.  But tell me what mtx is...

Give u 5 seconds to start typing üòù

[17-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mtx should be a transaction

[17-Mar-19 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because of sapling... you need to create it with some huge function
