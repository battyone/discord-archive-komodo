```OSError: /usr/local/lib/libcryptoconditions.a: invalid ELF header```

[07-Jan-19 05:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that is still same

[07-Jan-19 05:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I need a static .a file

[07-Jan-19 05:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to include in go lang code

[07-Jan-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh actually I didn't look to any files, just saw that below `cc_jsonRPC` calling instead of `jsonRPC`

[07-Jan-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Will make a PR now lol

[07-Jan-19 05:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes mate.... thanks üôÇ üëç

[07-Jan-19 05:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can help with ELF header that will help too

[07-Jan-19 05:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
maybe @ca333 can help later when free

[07-Jan-19 05:37 PM] ca333#0118
the static library libcryptoconditions.a is screwed @grewalsatinder - most likely OS incompatiblity/wrong build bath, etc.

[07-Jan-19 05:38 PM] ca333#0118
have you built/installed it on the machine you re getting the error above?

[07-Jan-19 05:38 PM] ca333#0118
or was it taken over from somewhere?

[07-Jan-19 05:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes mate, built it with `./autogen.sh` `./configure` `make` `sudo make install`

[07-Jan-19 05:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
master branch

[07-Jan-19 05:39 PM] ca333#0118

Can anyone advice best chanel for someone interested in learning about development

and also any opportunities to help with projects, thanks

[17-Jan-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
best way is to start testing to understand how CC work. then you can start making custom CC

[17-Jan-19 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
@Shaf feel free to drop any questions you might have here or in #dev-general there a lot of people who are glad to help with even basic questions 
Also #kmdlabs is a great place to start since as James said testing is a good point to understand how things works and kmdlabs is a open community oriented on Komodo tech testing (CC as well)

It's possible to overfill a tokenfillask. I don't see it as much of a problem, but this is the output of tokenorders now. I could see this breaking dapps that make the assumption that `"totalrequired":` and ` "price"` will always be there. Probably enough to just take note of it tbh

[19-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
Don't understand this separation thing as much as I should, but should these two lines be interchangeable?

mtx.vout.push_back(MakeTokensCC1vout(EVAL_ASSETS, 5, mypk));
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(EVAL_TOKENS, 5, mypk));

[19-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
they seem to be in at least some cases

[19-Jan-19 12:35 PM] dimxy#2587
Those are different vouts.

We introduced 2-eval vouts in this version

[19-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
The result is still the same. I'm basically just wondering what the difference is between these two

[19-Jan-19 12:41 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes it might be replaced.
The difference is that in the first case tokens became in one-eval EVAL_TOKENS vouts, in the second case they are remained two-eval EVAL_ASSETS+EVAL_TOKENS vouts

[19-Jan-19 12:42 PM] dimxy#2587
first case tokens you would see in tokenbalance output

[19-Jan-19 12:43 PM] dimxy#2587
it is like the second case tokens remain tokenconverted

[19-Jan-19 12:45 PM] dimxy#2587
so using the first case MakeCC1vout we do not need tokenconvert back

[19-Jan-19 12:52 PM] dimxy#2587
I'll take a look at tokenfillask either

[19-Jan-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
the overfilling order thing can't be done via rpc commands. I set received_assetoshis to a static value for that to happen

[19-Jan-19 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
or rather I replaced received_assetoshis in those two vouts with a static value

pushed a new update to jl777 branch that supports -ac_cclib=<name>
Jthis allows devs to make changes to a single file cclib.cpp and define a user defined CC that uses dynamic libraries so no need to even recompile komodod. this enables a separation of a user defined CC from komodod, yet is is part of komodod at runtime

For now, you need to go into src/cc dir and run ./makecclib to make the src/cclib.so file that will be searched for

{Reactions}
shexy (2) 

[19-Jan-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the -ac_cclib=<name> must match the MYCCLIBNAME that is defined at the top of cclib.cpp

[19-Jan-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the name specified in -ac_cclib must match the name inside cclib.cpp

[19-Jan-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a CClib_Dispatch function that is called for evalcodes 0x10 to 0x7f (reserved for user defined CC)

[19-Jan-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what this means is that without rebuilding komodod, you can make a new CC that is inside cclib.cpp (and whatever files linked in to cclib.so) to do validation. For now, only the validation is added. for constructing CC tx, some external process will be needed which can be done however the custom CC wants it to

[19-Jan-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so for now, it is just a theoretical support for user defined CC, I guess we can make a pass through rpc that will invoke a custom CC rpc,but I leave that for someone else to do

[19-Jan-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ca333 is working on the build part, for now windows likely wont build at all

[19-Jan-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
"no need to even recompile komodod" is pretty amazing

[19-Jan-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a dynamic cclib.so library

[19-Jan-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
name is verified to match the -ac_cclib name, if so any CC evalcode 0x10 to 0x7f are sent into the cclib for validation

[19-Jan-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if you dont update the cclib, the cclib.so wont be updated

[19-Jan-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
dynamic loadable libraries, so = shared object

[19-Jan-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
that will make it easier for CC devs wanting to write custom things at the c/c++ level, great feature

[19-Jan-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810

now i got it so you can define all your rpc methods via data table

of course you need to handle the rpc request when it comes in, but now there is rpc access to the cclib

latest jl777 and FSM uses cclib.so, and maybe there are some build issues. if so report to ca333

Is it possible to have an oracle search a record whether or not someone is dead. And if that someone is dead, a cc automatically transfers funds in wallet to their heirs?

Then you would no longer need to trust someone with your keys

[22-Jan-19 09:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem would be to have a reliable source to prove one is dead I assume?

Oracle know you are dead > funds transferred to multisig notary (not kmd notary but a real life one) adress > people sign off on the death > funds released?

why not use heir CC?
