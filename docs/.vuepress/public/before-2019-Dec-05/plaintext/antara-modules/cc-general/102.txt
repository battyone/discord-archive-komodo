Like a symbol locking as an `oraclesdata` and `batontxid` encoding as some service data and then have to get `oraclesamples` as a proof for this symbol on execution?

[26-Sep-18 08:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Proof of source link consensus 🤔 Or just "proof of source code"

[26-Sep-18 08:51 AM] Mylo#8306
proof of vim.  yeah i don't mind reading ridiculous implementation potential.   the bch files and 5kB is interesting and ridiculous considering kmd has 8kB to offer to any AC.  

so are there any docs on `oraclesdata` `batontxid` and `oraclesamples`?

[26-Sep-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
cryptoconditions.info has a section on oracles

have to do a monthly recap in the community site methinks

just ask any questions if unclear

[27-Sep-18 10:40 AM] sφldat#8733
The ARK team has already developed a Smartbridge for BTC, LTC and ETH https://marketplace.arkaces.com/ https://github.com/ark-aces, (v2 in 2 months) maybe they can use CC to implement 2 Smartbridge (KMD-ARK then ARK-ETH) to create a CC soldity interpreter. 
The problem is that ARK does not have UTXO, so they have to adapt the logic by making a Hash timelock contract or a sub-chain UTXO. 
What do you think of that ?

[27-Sep-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, why not!

[27-Sep-18 11:18 AM] sφldat#8733
Okay, so you think it's achievable

[27-Sep-18 02:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
then lets set a meet up , I also think that Ark is extremely a good project overall if thats possible why not do it?

[27-Sep-18 02:55 PM] TonyL#3577
First 7 menu items seems working. So if follow guide now possible to setup gateway (but not make transactions yet). All created stuff (oracles, tokens, gateways) it store in separate files and printout as lists as kindly reminder where needed. 

Need few more days to make setup more smooth and arrange gw transactions + make this stuff crash less than 1 time per 5 calls...

Also in further plans is kinda monitoring tool for gateway node operator where he can see pending/successful transactions, health status of `oraclefeed` instances and lists of oraclized/missed heights

@SHossain oh it's some template from tests from which I've start this repo (will deprecate in next commit) but now auto-tests performing in RPC framework.
To use gateways CLI you need to execute `gateways_cc_cli.py`  (will update readme in next commit as well)

In this version all the steps for gateway preparing are separated to demonstrate more and kinda educate but in general it's possible to make it as a wizard - you input all needed params for token/oracle and receive  a gatewaybind txid as reasult

Drop this release run instruction here in case if somebody will want to join you in testing  😃  : 

How to create very own gateway with gateways_cc_cli.py tool:
Guide for cli calls usage: http://pad.supernet.org/cc_gateways_guide
0) clone https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui and run `gateways_cc_cli.py` (it should be run by python3)
Be sure that system knows path to your komodod and daemon for desired assetchain is up
1) Press `0` to create token (Use name same as name of asset you want to tokenize e.g. KMD. Please note that supply setting in 10e-8 pow)
2) Press  `2` to create oracle (Use Ihh type and name of asset as well) It will also automatically register it and subscribe once
3) if you'll need to broadcast height more than once in one block it might be a good idea to create some more subscribe UTXOs for your oracle by pressing `3` and use `Oracle subscription UTXOs generator`
4) Then you have to convert your tokens for usage with gatewayCC (for this use the `[5] Tokens converter tool`)
Just follow the steps, input all the needed details and your transaction should get to rawmempool (and you'll get back to menu without any notification, sorry about that)
5) Wait till transaction from `step 4` mined and you have everything now to finally bind the gateway by `[6] Bind gateway`
Just use the txids which you get from previous steps where needed and read the hinds and your gatewaybind transaction should get to rawmempool (and you'll get back to menu without any notification, sorry about that). 
! Please note that you have to input real token supply here (you can get it from tokeninfo it's what you used on step 1 but with 8 zeros)
After this transaction mined your gateway should be ready and you'll able to check it by `gatewaysinfo transactionidfromstep5`
6) Compile `oraclefeed dAPP` and wait for the next update 😃

Some updates if somebody playing with Gateways CC TUI (https://github.com/tonymorony/kmd_cc_qa/blob/master/gateways_cc_cli.py):
- Fixed `tokens converter` and  `bind gateway` so now have printouts as well
- Also made initial implementation for `Run oraclefeed dAPP` and made implementation of `z_sendmany` so now possible to made "right" transaction to fund gateway and tokens receiver addresses

Next but not the last in todo list:
- implementation of auto `gatewaysdeposit` and `gatewaysclaim` 
- implementation of `gatewayswithdraw`
- more info printouts adding
- new readme creation

[30-Sep-18 02:20 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c I lost in numbers a little bit.
I'm creating a token:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 tokencreate KMD 1 Test`
Getting token with `"supply": 100000000`
Then doing tokenconvert and gatewaysbind, for both  as supply put `100000000`
Getting such gateway:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewaysinfo 25d44838bad71592c2a8ffb1bb31e7a17e10fa34631df8246846ccf7fe72d470

  "remaining": "3000019.90100200",
  "issued": "-3000018.90100200"
}
```
Is everything converting as expected - just wonder why such conversion for gateway was chosen? 
Keeping in mind exponent for different CCs is really mindblowing - for oracle everything in satoshis, token I have to create with supply in 10^-8 pow, but bind with real supply 🤕 
 And also - what means "remaining" and "issued"  with these scary numbers 😃 ?

[30-Sep-18 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
And also here:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL1 gatewayspending 25d44838bad71592c2a8ffb1bb31e7a17e10fa34631df8246846ccf7fe72d470 KMD
{
  "coin": "KMD",
  "pending": [
    {
      "txid": "47132762ff6a679c2c9d3310dc4bf323b1f614309e5b468eaa207ba168761888",

      "withdrawaddr": "RMLBM7dNHUqsfnExV3H9uHeZzPi5dsYSkv",
      "amount": "0.00000100"
    }
  ],
  "queueflag": 0
}
```
Is this pending sum in tokens? I've used `z_sendmany` and `gatewaysdeposit` for 0.01 KMD to gatewasdeposit address. 
If   "totalsupply": "1.00000000" for gateway is in -8 pow of token supply in case of 0.01 KMD pending `amount` should be less I think - 
0.0000000001 . Is it because I've reached "minimal" limit? If yes - it's looks like an easy way to abuse gateway in case of real asset big cost (when worth to burn chain tx fee, to get some more asset tokens)

there can easily be bugs. keep in mind the display is just displaying the internal numbers is whatever format it is displaying it in

but a total supply being less than remaining is not good. likely due to you using an active address, this is called a bug

you seem to be assuming the gateways CC has no bugs...

[30-Sep-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt even have validation active yet, so bugs there will be many

@jl777c Thanks! Have I note such things as Github issues?
Sometimes tbh I'm even don't know is it a bug or feature since of complexity when all this stuff working together 😃

yes, need to drill down into cli commands to isolate the bug so I can fix it

usually I fix the bugs fast enough as soon as they are reproducible and clearly described

Thanks for clarification! I'll provide cli commands tomorrow since not with PC already

Hello, I'm learning about Crypto-Conditions and UTXO tx. I see this image but I'm confused about a detail. Why do some transactions appear to cost 1 KMD while others appear to cost none?
