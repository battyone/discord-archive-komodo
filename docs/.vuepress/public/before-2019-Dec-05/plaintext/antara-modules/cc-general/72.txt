diceaddfunding by someone that didnt create the diceplan should fail

[21-Aug-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise they can cheat by putting in entropy values that lets them win

[21-Aug-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
just like faucet, each entropy utxo allows one dicebet per block

[21-Aug-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, understood.

Nice to see miss Peggy in list. üòÅ

[21-Aug-18 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
wow, lots more stuff to test

[21-Aug-18 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is there a way to do something like "If you provide the plaintext to this hash, coins are sent to you" ?

[21-Aug-18 02:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand almost all what they'll do, except few.
MOFN and TRIGGERS

[21-Aug-18 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
the plaintext could be in op_return or maybe KV, and would allow people to get a bounty/prize/payment for proof they know the hash to something. Sounds like it could be useful in general

[21-Aug-18 02:26 PM] TonyL#3577
It's like a TV series: little spoiler and "all interesting you'll see in the next series"

[21-Aug-18 02:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
plaintext would need to be stored encrypted in KV, where person who created the contract could claim the rewards to end the bounty for the hash

[21-Aug-18 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
MofN as in 2of3 multisig, but where M and N can be up to 255

[21-Aug-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
TRIGGERS would be able to be triggered upon a variety of things. reveal on secret could be one, but that is subject to MITM attack

[21-Aug-18 02:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
why would we need multisig as contract ? ü§î

[21-Aug-18 02:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
the user also puts a lot of trust storing sensitive strings/files in the blockchain, so some use cases would not work

[21-Aug-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
try doing any multisig with more than 15 signers using bitcoin

[21-Aug-18 02:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, sure will do. I really need to do that and learn too.... üòÅ 
think I got what you saying....

[21-Aug-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant have more than 15 multisig signers with bitcoin

[21-Aug-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is very inefficient as you need to include the pubkeys for all signers for all transactions

[21-Aug-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
also it could be that it is information that is being unlocked with MofN, not just payments

[21-Aug-18 02:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
proving you know the scriptPubkey that corresponds to a hash of the inputs (p2sh) is how bitcoin works internally, it would be a more generalized version at the CC level. Constraining the data to only fit inside kmd op_return is reasonable, it's not meant for supporting 4GB files. But for instance, I could prove to you that I know the private key to the SSL cert of komodoplatform.com, by giving you a hash, and I could be paid a security bounty automagically via the blockchain. It's like all these popular bug bounty programs, automated on the blockchain *and* transparent to all parties. It prevents the black market of selling 0days for 200k-1M+ USD, which some might see as a bug

[21-Aug-18 02:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
clearer. thanks üëç

[21-Aug-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
I want to make mutlisig non-interactive like it is now where you need to pass around the tx to all the signers

[21-Aug-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so the blockchain will be used to gather the M signatures and when complete, it is released

[21-Aug-18 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is something called PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transactions) coming soon in BTC core, seems to do the same

[21-Aug-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this will make multisig much easier to use. at most an "approve txid" tx would be submitted by the signer

[21-Aug-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
after all these years, it is strange multisig is still so hard to use

[21-Aug-18 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is James will be done before btc core has started to bikeshed the merge of PSBT

[21-Aug-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
think I get you on multisig. The most easiest way of creating multisig address/wallet for me was trying out NEM's first iteration of their GUI wallet.

[21-Aug-18 02:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Your explanation matches their GUI that I experienced then.

showing 16 digits after the `.` for price

[21-Aug-18 04:02 PM] SHossain#0007
`tokenorders` not showing 16 digits after the decimal though

[21-Aug-18 04:05 PM] SHossain#0007
actually that was a `fillbid`

[21-Aug-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810

fillask is displaying 8 digits

[21-Aug-18 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so printout resolution having too many 0's is the most horrible bug found so far?

[21-Aug-18 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. this is not even a bug. just a small display issue

[21-Aug-18 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007

https://github.com/tonymorony/kmd_cc_qa I've started to write some auto-tests for Token CC
For this CC testing I'm planning two modes: 1) Tests itself 2) Kinda CLI exchange based on Token CC -  in case if someone will want to have fun manually 
For now made auto-test for token adding process and in CLI possible to add tokens and list all available tokens.
Trading features of this CC I want to cover until the weekend.

Bottleneck in real case which I see:  It may be spammed by transactions with lowest bet amount and lowest risk odds in each block so real players will not able to play because of no UTXO's

Yeah wrote about it above) Actually real casinos doing totally same way: open high stakes tables so whales have space to play anytime. 
Pff so much gambling ICO promised RNG on blockchain - nobody delivered, but looks like we're actually have it - open-sourced fair RNG connected to blockchain. 
From first  touch this CC seems like a just demonstration but such concept is really mindblowig for gambling industry since here is a problem of lack of trust to soft providers.
But in product like this you can check source code, fork it, test and play, it's a real destination of blockchain - such proofs.
