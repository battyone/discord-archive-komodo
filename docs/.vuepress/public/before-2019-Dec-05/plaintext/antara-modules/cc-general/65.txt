Found this tool https://x64dbg.com/ good for Windows debugging
Have to download it and run something like a:
```x96dbg.exe "C:\Users\rigdirector\Desktop\komodowin\komodod.exe" -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=ATX -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -pubkey=02ff7c1e7e4060f3815478944e3907ff722366da1e6453e008ebd779e5e162779b -addnode=94.130.224.11``` which initiate GUI

how are things?

osx and win waiting for fix

[17-Aug-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
VRSC fork excitement so i dont think much more CC testing

[17-Aug-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
last I heard there might have been a rewards bug, at least an optimization in the non consensus code, but no other issues I have seen

[17-Aug-18 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
will try to unlock a reward now.

[17-Aug-18 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are much better JSON errors now for rewards internals, fyi

[17-Aug-18 01:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I saw my name mentioned but there is a lot of backscroll, let me know how i can help

@webworker01 you could ask @radix42 who has dealt with zmq+windows issues in maintaining the winzec wallet

[17-Aug-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think he disabled zmq sometimes

[17-Aug-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
since it's an optional dependency

[17-Aug-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i am not sure if it's optional in all cases or what you are doing

[17-Aug-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can try `--disable-zmq` or whatever it's called

[17-Aug-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can disable some tests, some tests require zmq

[17-Aug-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is your end goal here?

[17-Aug-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh

[17-Aug-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@webworker01 which file is failing? you mean cryptoconditions.py test?

[17-Aug-18 03:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
James changed some consensus code and I haven't updated my faucet tests yet to reflect his changes

[17-Aug-18 03:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, i saw talk of that flying by

[17-Aug-18 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
a segfault in validating a block, only on certain operating systems

[17-Aug-18 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
that sounds like maybe a big/small endian issue, or maybe a compiler that has different undefined behavior

[17-Aug-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
just test on unix for now

👍 

[17-Aug-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
osx and windows dont pass low level tests and until there is a release that fixes it, it wont work

[17-Aug-18 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but on unix there are no known CC bugs

[17-Aug-18 04:01 PM] SHossain#0007
we are progressing slowly with macOS debugging

[17-Aug-18 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
hopefully, we are getting closer with each test

wow, so my tests are even useful to help debug this segfault, very nice 😃

[17-Aug-18 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain which compiler are you using? gcc or clang?

[17-Aug-18 04:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
that determines if you need to use gdb or lldb

[17-Aug-18 04:12 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry. @libscott is writing the tests and i'm running them

[17-Aug-18 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
on your core file

[17-Aug-18 04:13 PM] SHossain#0007
these are from his repo

[17-Aug-18 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, that is cryptoconditions.c, i thought it said cryptoconditions.py

[17-Aug-18 04:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
have you generated a backtrace from a coredump yet?

found the issue I think 😃

[17-Aug-18 04:14 PM] libscott#8867
its stupid (can you imagine?)

[17-Aug-18 04:14 PM] SHossain#0007
after more than 10 tests :trollface:

[17-Aug-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
undefined behavior being different?

[17-Aug-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
or the layout of memory, can often cause these platform-dependent issues

[17-Aug-18 04:15 PM] SHossain#0007
@libscott compiling latest

[17-Aug-18 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
🍿 🍿

[17-Aug-18 04:15 PM] libscott#8867
I think it's just due to something being defined twice, once in a header file and then again in the .cpp file

[17-Aug-18 04:15 PM] libscott#8867
so I changed the header definition to an `extern` and now hopefully itll work

[17-Aug-18 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
is it CCerror ?

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] libscott#8867
it appears to be an issue with the CC code

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
i just added the CCerror extern

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
specifically, `std::string CCerror`

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] libscott#8867
nono

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been there all along, not anything new

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] libscott#8867
it's in libcryptoconditions

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
yay, it wasn't me!

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] libscott#8867

[17-Aug-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
plz make pull request to jl777 branch when it is fixed

@jl777c we might as well try to debug the windows issue using this branch
