i am using your exact command from the gist, with the same conf file (changed to my valid pubkey)

[06-Aug-18 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
still the same error, arg

[06-Aug-18 06:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i should be on the latest `jl777` branch, or a different one?

[06-Aug-18 06:22 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm from about 12 hours ago

[06-Aug-18 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
just making sure there was/wasn't a CC branch i should be on

[06-Aug-18 06:23 PM] Mylo#8306
commit `79a3b761c234a140b622e24e8307ce0c65627e52`

```     if ( NOTARY_PUBKEY33[0] == 0 )

[06-Aug-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the code that making stuff not work for me, it's detecing no pubkey somehow

[06-Aug-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c how is it that I can start an AC with the above, with NOTARY_PUBKEY recognized, yet the code above returns -1 ?

[06-Aug-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i made ensureCC_requirements tell me which reason it is failing, it can't find the pubkey

[06-Aug-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow it is set to y=02de7795adfe6454844d7991103c97754fb41b71b44db1ac5f30d26b24d13aca30

[06-Aug-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the y= in front is not valid

[06-Aug-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe put -pubkey= in the beginning

[06-Aug-18 06:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
i added the ERR=-1 which means it's the pubkey check, not the addressindex check

[06-Aug-18 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
mylo is importing  privkey, then using that as a pubkey. I am using getnewaddress and then using that. Could that cause a difference?

[06-Aug-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the address is in the wallet? and it is the right pubkey?

[06-Aug-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
getnewaddress from the -regtest instance? otherwise it will be in the wrong wallet.dat

parses pubkey correctly, i generated it in that wallet, validates correctly

this is on Linux, on `cctests` branch that I branched from `jl777` last night, if that matters

it might be the other cases being checked for that is giving error

not sure if anyone else is getting this error

if NOTARY_PUBKEY33 is not null, it really shouldnt give that error

Mylo doesn't have this problem in his docker stuff, we are doing something slightly different somehow

i am not sure what that means

[06-Aug-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
utxo with CC vout

[06-Aug-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so like p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh there is a CC vout

[06-Aug-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is sent to a CC vout, then it needs to follow the specific CC contract rules to be able to be spent

ok, thanks for clarifying

[06-Aug-18 09:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is good, the test is progressing much further. I still have to teach the test suite to use -pubkey, which probably means always importing a fixed pub/priv key testing pair like Mylo. Otherwise, you have to start daemon, getnewaddress, validateaddress, stop, restart with pubkey

[06-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
morning!  i've gone to check letolabs commits before notarystats 🙀

[06-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Mylo#8306
fyi from mm2 chatter
```
Yes, with a Docker release and a core developers can re-enter the same Docker environment that dumped the core and use the gdb to work with  the crash (gdb works well with both the C and the Rust code).
```

{Reactions}
🆒 

[07-Aug-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
NOTARY_PUBKEY.() <- that indicates -pubkey= wasnt used and is likely the problem of launching komodod via different code paths, some with -pubkey=, others without

[07-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Mylo#8306
faucetfund expects a string, not an integer or decimal/float, is this intentional?
also, from one terminal
```
curl -v --user user   --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "faucetfund", "params": ["7"]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```
and in another terminal this popped up
```
ExtractDestination failed
ExtractDestination failed
```
^^^What does **ExtractDestination failed** mean?

The rpc returned no probs from command line and from curl though
```
{"result":{"result":"success","hex":"<THE HEX STRING GOT SNIPPED HERE"},"error":null,"id":"curltest"}
```

[07-Aug-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ExtractDestination failed is an error with the scriptPubKey

[07-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Mylo#8306

made lots of progress yesterday, I can now startup a CC AC in the test suite

[07-Aug-18 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
TIL is that komodod -server=1 does not mean the same thing as server=1 in the conf file, that is confusing

my current bug is that the server doesn't exit or go into the background, and the test suite hangs

[07-Aug-18 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
when it starts it up, the test komodod doesn't exit like it should (I have server=1 in the conf and -daemon on the CLI), so it hangs the test suite

[07-Aug-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant just put it in the background with &

[07-Aug-18 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is from the Python test suite

[07-Aug-18 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought server=1 or -daemon would make it go into the background and allow the python function to return instead of waiting forever for an exit code

[07-Aug-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the line that uses `subprocess.check_call` to execute komodod

did you try just &

[07-Aug-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
which waits for an exit code

[07-Aug-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
hey, why not, I will try that now

[07-Aug-18 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this was working before I added various CC params. And when I use the exact same command manually it goes into the background correctly

[07-Aug-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am modifying things to try &, i have to change how it calls check_call

[07-Aug-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think i have discovered the issue

[07-Aug-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326

the `-rpcwait` makes it wait forever I think

[07-Aug-18 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
and because I don't have -conf it might be getting confused. Feels like I am close to getting this working

[07-Aug-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
that works. there was an issue with what rpc port it thought it should use

[07-Aug-18 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326

`-server` i thought was for json/rpc server, not to go into bg which is `-daemon`.  However the rpc loop - yes i see that when the defaults are applied (e.g. not listed in .conf) and it takes the first `komodo-cli` command for the loop to stop "PASSPORT []....." repeated on cli.  I was lazily trying to allow rpc calls remotely to test my code from home without needing to commit/pull on experimental stuff.
