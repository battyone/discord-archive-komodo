all contracts have a general CC address for that contract where you can send funds into

[08-Aug-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it is possible for any pubkey to have a CC address, this allows to have 2 forms of locked funds, one in the general fund spendable (under the right conditions) by anybody and a more restrictive one that can only be spent by pubkey's owner AND under the right conditions

[08-Aug-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright I had a missing check against the sbits/txid for finding CC vins. fixing

[08-Aug-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix. this should reject the onchain unlocks that violate the rule about needing to be from the same plan. that is the first test. then it needs to make sure it wasnt made too strict. it is a hardforking change so AT1 wont sync due to the rejection of the violating unlocks

[08-Aug-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto I think you need to handle the case of a null being returned. I think it is the test framework that is crashing due to unhandled null pointer coming back

[08-Aug-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
then again it could be a crash due to not having any coins at all, so you cant pay for the txfee

[08-Aug-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
can someone make sure CC rpc doesnt coredump the komodod for a pubkey without any funds at all

[08-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
AT1 doesn't sync from scratch any more

[08-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
Ready for AT2 everyone? ðŸ˜›

[08-Aug-18 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
it syncs up until block ~7800. Should we try to keep it?

[08-Aug-18 02:15 PM] Alright#0419
Feeling like we shouldn't because it might give us problems down the line

[08-Aug-18 02:20 PM] Alright#0419

[08-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, so I had a zombie process for the same chain running

[08-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
So there *was* something on that port

[08-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
`./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=AT2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -pubkey=<PUBKKEY> -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5`

[08-Aug-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

[08-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
So we keep AT1 or go to AT2? CHMEX's explorer just resynced to the proper AT1 chain after updating, but I'm afraid reorging 1000+ blocks will cause a lot of problems

[08-Aug-18 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright `Unable to start HTTP server` pretty much always means you already have something running on that port

[08-Aug-18 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
i run into it a lot when the test suite crashes, sometimes it leaves zombies

[08-Aug-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c would you be ok with me adding some error checking to CC RPC's such that they return something like `{ result: "error", message: "You must fund the faucet before retrieving funds from it"}`

[08-Aug-18 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can test for the current behavior, but I think from the perspective of app developers using RPC's, it's much friendlier to always be able to check the "result" key and look at "message" if result != "success"

[08-Aug-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure yet if the same bug occurs when a funded faucet goes to 0 funding

[08-Aug-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, please! if you can add error messages I would be most grateful

[08-Aug-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright did you read what i wrote about fixing the rewards CC, that would make it not sync to the existing chain?

[08-Aug-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is expected if the new code is working

The only difference between the two nodes was the one failing to create the txs had not yet mined a block on the chain. I made it mine a block, and now it's able to create the txs

@jl777c i get these errors thousands of times, many times for every block in the CC tests, can you explain what is going on?

as for good news, i can mine regtest blocks of a CC-enable AC that is created in our test suite

[09-Aug-18 06:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have mature coins, but `faucetfund` still refuses to work for me

[09-Aug-18 07:04 AM] Mylo#8306
are you using a non-notary pubkey?  seems like it tries to look it up in notary array but returns -1 index (just a guess?)

[09-Aug-18 07:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i am using a non-notary pubkey

[09-Aug-18 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810

maybe I need to add an exemptions for blockhash on regtest mode?

@dukeleto latest jl777 branch ignores target difficulty in regtest mode

[09-Aug-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
can someone plz make sure rewards CC still works? I did make a change to utxo selection, so it is possible all of the CC are broken

[09-Aug-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
also does it really crash if there are no funds at all?

[09-Aug-18 12:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hi!

[09-Aug-18 12:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how can i test the new stuff @dukeleto is making?

[09-Aug-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no need for you to test that. it is a test suite that you just run. the point is to combine manual testing with automated tests, maybe automate the manual testing. whatever automated tests exists, there is no need to manually test them. just run it when the bugs are fixed in the test suite

[09-Aug-18 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok.. thanks.

[09-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Mylo#8306

[09-Aug-18 02:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers the tests I am working on are in `./qa/pull-tester/cryptoconditions.py` if you want to look at them

[09-Aug-18 02:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
`./qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions` is how to run them

[09-Aug-18 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo faucetfund is acting weird on me, I have mature funds and I can't make it happy

[09-Aug-18 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326

[09-Aug-18 02:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
but creating the faucet in tests in regtest mode, I can't get it working. Do I need to run any other RPCs, like creating a token/asset or anything before funding a faucet?

[09-Aug-18 02:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c thanks for that, I will merge jl777 branch into cctests branch. I am also adding better JSON errors to faucetget while debugging it.

[09-Aug-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
you need the funds to create the faucet

you can see i have a non-zero mature balance

[09-Aug-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
and my faucet has 0.0 funding, as expected at first

[09-Aug-18 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
my newbie thinking tells me I should be able to use `faucetfund 1` to add 1 coin to the faucet

[09-Aug-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
at this time, it seems that the RPC fails at this line: `funds = atof(params[0].get_str().c_str()) * COIN;`

[09-Aug-18 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
my RPC call never gets to the internal `FaucetFund` function

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
things work as expected on AT1, which already has funding in the faucet. But maybe I am missing some RPC call that is needed for the first time?

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
try faucetfund "1"

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought it was going to be something like that

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
at first I tried 1.0, because I didn't realize it was assetoshis

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
funds is amount in floating, see the atof

[09-Aug-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so "1.0"

[09-Aug-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be a string

[09-Aug-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
not a number

[09-Aug-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that error is from the C++ function `.get_str()` I now realize. I wasn't sure where it was coming from

[09-Aug-18 03:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
trying a string now

[09-Aug-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c you were right, of course
