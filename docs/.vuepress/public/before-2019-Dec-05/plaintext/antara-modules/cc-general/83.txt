yes, CC is in addition to standard utxo

[27-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Anthony#6143
this is why I'm asking now in an early stage before things are cemented down

[27-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Anthony#6143
I think that it will be possible to have crypto condition programmer be a real profession

[27-Aug-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
most definitely!

and that it would be util if ode can be inherited

[27-Aug-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is quite a specialized thing that most wont be able to do effectively at first

[27-Aug-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
code can be reused

[27-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Anthony#6143
for example from this dice example all dice related contracts can stem

[27-Aug-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
C++ inheritance can be used but my expertise is not C++

[27-Aug-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
I would welcome a C++ expert to make things more reusable and to have things like inheritance. These are all matters of the lamguage, rather than CC contracts specifically. CC contracts ultimately just needs to return a boolean true/false for a transaction

[27-Aug-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the current CC contracts are just my specific implementation, which due to my using C exclusively is more verbose and C based

[27-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Anthony#6143
because your calling the cc code into libbitcoin_server.a

[27-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Anthony#6143
What if one had the desire to remove the dice code, youd have to have everyone update their wallets?

[27-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Anthony#6143
Im trying to see how it would be possible to have an on/off switch perhaps like a spork

[27-Aug-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
It would be possible to allow the creator of a diceplan to turn it off, but to prevent the blockchain from allowing new diceplans to be created, then some height activated disabling would be needed

[27-Aug-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on a way to have runtime liked modules, but that opens up a new set of issues

[27-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c can you change either the help info for `tokencreate` to reflect that supply is *1000000000

[27-Aug-18 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
or make it take a value in assets instead

[27-Aug-18 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
so divide the value the user gives by 100000000 or just change the help info for it

[27-Aug-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
can you propose specific help text?

[27-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
ðŸ¤”

[27-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Alright#0419
`tokencreate name coins description`? Even this doesn't seem right

[27-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Alright#0419
just keep `tokencreate name supply description` and I'll add something to clarify that it's *100000000

[27-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
Will be back in a couple hours, will do it then

[27-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Mylo#8306
@Anthony thanks for your questions.  Yes, it looks like being familiar with how (Crypto Conditions) UTXO Smart Contracts work will be a specialised field in the future.   Libraries of utility functions in specific (business etc.) domains will probably eventuate.  Let's see how it goes!!!

[27-Aug-18 10:22 PM] TonyL#3577
I've faced a problem:  receiving  `"status":"loss"` in RPC for all bets :

```

I'm comparing plan funding before/after bets and part of bets actually won according to balance, but dicestatus status is loss for all

[28-Aug-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL what chain, how to invoke it? need more details

[28-Aug-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have a bettxid that won it would help immensely

[28-Aug-18 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c it's a chain which creating in test-framework
```
                    '-ac_name=REGTEST',
                    '-conf='+self.options.tmpdir+'/node0/REGTEST.conf',
                    '-port=64367',
                    '-rpcport=64368',
                    '-regtest',
                    '-addressindex=1',
                    '-spentindex=1',

                    '-rpcpassword=rt'
```

[28-Aug-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh... does it work on normal chains?

[28-Aug-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
what i need is the spenttx details

[28-Aug-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
latest version prints out the txid for the spenttx

[28-Aug-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
given the bettx details and spenttx details, i need to make sure it knows if it is a win or loss

[28-Aug-18 07:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Alright let me check for these details. On normal chain I receive both win/loss results when manually testing

[28-Aug-18 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i updated it so if it cant find the spenttxid, it returns timeout. it could be the bettx is still pending

[28-Aug-18 07:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I tried to count other to `status: loss or status: win` response as win but receive only losses

[28-Aug-18 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you are sure the dicefinish is called and confirmed on chain

[28-Aug-18 07:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, there is one block timeout after finish and one after dicefinish sending

[28-Aug-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
need more details. if it works on normal chain, the issue is the regtest chain is behaving differently

[28-Aug-18 07:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Running the tests, will provide it asap

[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats how I'm placing bets:        
 ``` 
         while (betcounter < 5):
              placebet = rpc.dicebet(dicename,diceid,"1","1")
              betid = self.send_and_mine(placebet["hex"])
              finish = rpc.dicefinish(dicename,diceid,betid)
              rpc.generate(1)
              betresult = rpc.dicestatus(dicename,diceid,betid)
              betcounter = betcounter + 1
              if betresult["status"] == "loss":
                  losscounter = losscounter + 1
              elif betresult["status"]  == "win":
                  wincounter = wincounter + 1
```

Placing bet:
`DEBUG:BitcoinRPC:-106-> dicebet ["LUCKY", "e99184d8c5a8160fd070e4450f8b533977c91c797eae71893ebdd166c0092254", "1", "1"]`

[28-Aug-18 07:28 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not receiving any other printouts

[28-Aug-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing in console?

[28-Aug-18 07:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
does dicefinish give some hex that needs to be sent?

[28-Aug-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
what does is the spent status for ef3e58b3e91a2d2fbc6b0fd04baac0837a5b01f50a633fde287db3683933820a vout.2

[28-Aug-18 07:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think there is a missing `sendrawtransaction` from the result of `dicefinish`

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, dicefinish needs to be broadcast

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL use `send_and_mine(finish["hex"])`

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
you did generate() but forgot to send the xtn

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes I've noticed it when wrote post above, just ran version with send_and_mine

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is exactly why i wrote that little helper that makes writing tests easier ðŸ˜ƒ

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
But I receive status loss straight

[28-Aug-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so this is not a bug?

[28-Aug-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know the txid that spent the bettxid?

[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll add now printout to script to track it

[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use the rpc call

[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
getspentinfo

[28-Aug-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810

that is a loss

when it printed that it won, it should have printed rawhex and txid

does it match

Hi, does DICE always send more than bet amount then return some?
In STAKED3 I bet `5`. `getbalance` showed `10` sent and later `5` returned.
The second time I didn't catch it happening.

[28-Aug-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
change?

[28-Aug-18 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
I didn't see double the amount sent the second time I did it.

[28-Aug-18 12:00 PM] CrisF#3405
Maybe due to timing of the `getbalance`?

[28-Aug-18 12:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Is doulble the bet always sent and I just didn't catch it the second time I tried?

[28-Aug-18 12:02 PM] CrisF#3405
