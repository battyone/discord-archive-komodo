IBM cryptographers Vadim Lyubashevsky and Gregor Seiler provide quantum safe cryptography standard, CRYSTALS-KYBER, CRYSTALS-#DILITHIUM and FALCON P.s. implemented in Komodo by Jl777 -> https://t.co/e5sA73yQQ9

Dilithium related ^^

[12-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Artist#0765
cool

[12-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Artist#0765
where? @Regnar

[12-Apr-19 06:19 PM] Regnar#6164
^ that link I posted was some IBM cryptographers talking about Dilithium signatures. Komodo just implemented a new Dilithium signature CC

[12-Apr-19 07:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
If anybody wants to suggest a stable-ish CC to be enabled in HUSH, now is the time

[12-Apr-19 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
these are our current settings: ```
# CryptoConditions/Custom Consensus params
FAUCET=228
HEIR=234
CHANNEL=235
ORACLE=236
GATEWAY=241
CCENABLE=$FAUCET,$HEIR,$CHANNEL,$ORACLE,$GATEWAY
```

[12-Apr-19 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
leaning towards adding Dilithium, and looking for suggestions

[13-Apr-19 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto Dilithium would be a safe bet IMO

[13-Apr-19 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
can't see any reason it would be forking

[13-Apr-19 11:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
groovy

[13-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright can you verify for me which ccenable number I should use for dilithium? My brain is a bit fried

[13-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i forgot what that variable is called and can't search for the hex to convert to decimal, lol

[13-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
having a table of values would be really nice to outsiders

[13-Apr-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
dilithium is only in the sudoku libcc if i remember right

[13-Apr-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it does belone as a core CC though

[13-Apr-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, i keep learning

[13-Apr-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush will have to do a forced update in a few weeks for new notaries, so we have a timeframe to make more updates soon

[13-Apr-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am just going to stick with the CC's that I have now. I will put Dilithium in the "to be enabled" category

[13-Apr-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c you were so right saying "perfection is the enemy of completion", as you always seem to be. I went down a deep rabbit hole modifying code I shouldn't, and Alright set me straight

[13-Apr-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I mined at least 10 testnets in the last 48hrs, and read parts of KMD internals I had never seen

[13-Apr-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
learned how magicExtra sausage is made, that is fascinating

[13-Apr-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I learned how badly I could break the mining process by changing things I don't fully understand

[13-Apr-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSHv3 is still a source code fork, but it's very tiny and lean and protected by an `if AC==HUSH` guard

[13-Apr-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was able to merge 20K lines of diff this morning, `jl777/dev` into my `duke` branch of hush3, *with no merge conflicts* and I almost cried tears of joy

[13-Apr-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
with the lag between CC being developed and it getting GUI and marketing, maybe being one year or more in many cases. any chain that specializes in maximizing any specific CC would end up being the showcase for that CC

[13-Apr-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am hoping to attract some CC devs to the new HUSH chain, and I am very excited about the possibilities of Heir and Oracle and basically all of it

[13-Apr-19 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are many unexplored avenues of HushList protocol + cryptoconditions, as well

[13-Apr-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if the viewing keys ever work, it might even be possible to combine zaddr and CC

[13-Apr-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I can imagine a CC where unless a specific address sends funds to it regularly, information is released, maybe the privkey that unlocks memo fields, or a viewkey

[13-Apr-19 02:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
dead man switch for whistleblowers

[13-Apr-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think a CC could inject a viewing key into OP_RETURN data, without touching zaddrs directly

[13-Apr-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be like a transistor with a control gate (triggered by tx)

[13-Apr-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so you send a tx to an address, then then enables those funds to be spent and doing so reveals the pubkey

[13-Apr-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
i could imagine a few people that would be interested in this kind of tech

yes, the only other cc i would suggest is the zaddr, but im not the first to the punch!

I'm not much of an expert on that, but I wonder if automatic rewards claiming cc module can be done...?

[04-May-19 03:19 PM] gcharang#6833
rewards claiming - is available only on the main KMD chain, which won't be getting CC
also, it defeats the purpose of "*active* user reward"

[04-May-19 03:20 PM] artik123#2884
what is the purpose of it being active?

[04-May-19 03:21 PM] artik123#2884
why it should be active?

[04-May-19 03:25 PM] gcharang#6833
I don't know the exact reason, but I think it is to
- make people use the KMD chain, update their nodes/wallets, keep up with the latest news of the network
- I remember reading somewhere that it will atleast make the tx fee effectively zero

[04-May-19 03:27 PM] artik123#2884
both reasons don't make sense to me... but 10x

[04-May-19 03:29 PM] gcharang#6833
anyway, relevant point is: "rewards claiming - is available only on the main KMD chain, which won't be getting CC"
what is `10x`?

[04-May-19 03:29 PM] artik123#2884

evalcode in this case

[11-Jun-19 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its a function that signs transactions

[11-Jun-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this kind of replaces that, its extremly diffrent.

[11-Jun-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
like I said, this wont work with many existing CCs. I think once we figure out how to use it, many new things will be possible

[11-Jun-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we are half way there, dimxy is using the ccopparams with pubkeys for marmara, and I used it without pubkeys for paymentsCC

[11-Jun-19 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes both is required

[11-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
a properly signed tx is an offchain operation

[11-Jun-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
however it is achieved is fine

[11-Jun-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the signing of tx is very o low level, they should all work the same ?

[11-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
cryptoconditions signing should be compatible

[22-Jun-19 01:48 AM] CyberTrucker#5260

@Deleted User pretty sure you can if you set `ac_sapling=<block height far in the future>`

[04-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why you would though

[04-Jul-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
@Alright if I use ac_sapling as you suggested, can I have overwinter without sapling ? I ask because I think that on kmd, both overwinter and sapling upgrades are fused/mised.

[04-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
I believe so, but I would need to test to confirm

[04-Jul-19 04:54 PM] Alright#0419
believe that would be the default behavior

[04-Jul-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
Ok thx. I did not know

[04-Jul-19 04:58 PM] phm87#7395
ac_sapling or ac_public ?

[04-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see why ac_public would disabled sapling

[04-Jul-19 04:58 PM] phm87#7395
I will read docs

[04-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User definitely does not

[04-Jul-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
just disables z transactions

[04-Jul-19 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
KMD itself is ac_public=1

[04-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
that and nlocktime stuff

[04-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
a few things, would need to read the spec from zcash

[04-Jul-19 05:00 PM] phm87#7395
I expect version 3 and not 4. Overwinter stuff but no sapling fields (or filled with 0)

[04-Jul-19 05:01 PM] phm87#7395
To test my stratum

[04-Jul-19 05:01 PM] phm87#7395
It should work for coins with overwinter but without sapling

[04-Jul-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
look at txes on OOT or ZILLA

This is my first attempt at making a CC from scratch, It changes a fair few things, and leverages the Verus Enhanced CCs with some changes I added myself, to make validation work. We havent tested this yet, but I hope to get a chain up on LABS as soon as I can. I tried to comment well, would be good if someone can have a look at this and let me know if there is something that needs clarifying, as I want people to understand how this works, so they can offer improvements to it. 
The one thing I dont like is that to make it work correctly, I needed to re purpouse the `version` integer in  `COptCCParams` to funcid. Really it should have both, or possibly, we can set version to 3, and maybe this will allow an extra integer to be added to the Class without beaking backwards compatibility.
