everyone or everything running a synced chain can be a portal to the oracle

[06-Sep-18 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Dat would be future - you have GUI implementation mobile app, you're in drugstore, input number to app, it's matching data with blockchain oracle - you see is it fake drug or not

[06-Sep-18 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
trust boundary extension protocol over the internet

[06-Sep-18 10:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So basically the oracle is a big OP_RETURN poster?

[06-Sep-18 10:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
well hopefully at some point by paying for the electricity to run the chain the internet would be free to all synced portals

[06-Sep-18 10:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
sry meta

[06-Sep-18 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha and your electricity consumption counter will send data about consumption automatically to oracle as a part of IOT

[06-Sep-18 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
And you'll pay it by rates declared in a smart-contract

[06-Sep-18 10:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
time to launch the cubesats

[06-Sep-18 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
There is so much wide space for really interesting implementations, but read ERC-20 token sellers whitepapers... ðŸ˜¦

[06-Sep-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah I am thinking CC will be the death knell for ETH's Gas model

[06-Sep-18 10:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So a chain can create tokens for each device(charge controller) and the oracle can then import data regarding consumption from that device

[06-Sep-18 10:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which would trigger a payments contract

[06-Sep-18 10:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which would make you pay for the consumption or get paid for extra energy sold

[06-Sep-18 10:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think i dont need the token part

[06-Sep-18 10:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
The hardware and software for realtime hex processing is ubiquitous thanks to MIDI but I'm not sure if that protocol has the data bandwidth

[06-Sep-18 10:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
It definitely has the speed though

[06-Sep-18 10:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
kmd is a chains only platform fortunately

[06-Sep-18 11:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
so where to start? decentralized twitter where everyone with the app syncs the chain to get the feed?

[06-Sep-18 11:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
and psot

[06-Sep-18 11:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
post

[06-Sep-18 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Not sure if it's possible to use now for something very close to "realtime" data publishing <- getting. Since you have to wait till data will be mined at least

[06-Sep-18 11:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess it boils down to chain speed then for social media applications

[06-Sep-18 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Proof of constancy of constitution document

[06-Sep-18 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
:trollface:

[06-Sep-18 11:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
I mean, smart meters? for power consumption? its already a thing and I'm assuming its just a database application logging it

[06-Sep-18 11:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
what if you could apply the oracle to power consumption?

[06-Sep-18 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
I don't know how it's worldwide but in Russia you have to manually input your data on website and then each few months guy from this company coming to physically proof it

[06-Sep-18 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
they deregulated energy in here in texas and trade it on an exchange. we have the only independent  power grid in this country.

[06-Sep-18 11:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
anyone can start a power company with enough money and sell to consumers

[06-Sep-18 11:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
but usage data is most likely proprietary on a local scale

[06-Sep-18 11:11 AM] actionslacks#4072
there are co-ops though that are citizen owned, I imagine that data could be polled somehow...

[06-Sep-18 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmmm, that's very new concept for me ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Sep-18 11:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
electricity yes, but internet providers still rule with the proverbial iron fist

[06-Sep-18 11:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
na zdorovje, or something like that. I dont come here as often as I should but thanks for the sharing of ideas

[06-Sep-18 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Haha thank you for Russian speaking trying! Would be great to discuss more real applications of different CC's and assetchains - come more often ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Sep-18 11:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
I hope maybe through this tech we can somehow transcend govt and wars and reach for the stars again

[06-Sep-18 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Technocracy society - thats what I dream about, that dream motivated me to degree in Nuclear physics and drives me to dive into the new technologies. Azimov's worlds...

[06-Sep-18 11:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
a republic of ideas as opposed to ideology

[06-Sep-18 11:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think the main problem is that people have been so indoctrinated to follow a centralized authority that a world without it is unimaginable.

[06-Sep-18 11:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
or anarchy

[06-Sep-18 11:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
but through trustless consensus that anarchy becomes entirely boring and stable. And also perfectly equitable. we are the architects of  this future. That is why I am here.

[06-Sep-18 11:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
Goodnight all.

[06-Sep-18 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Sleep tight!

[06-Sep-18 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I created an oracle

[06-Sep-18 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "method":"oraclescreate",
"params": ["Mensajes MaÃ±aneros","Morning messages","s"]
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "result": {
        "result": "success",
        "txid": "2779956270435350ef49a4f4f600150b1cb4c266c67312e0f910aba1dae9e01b",
        "name": "Mensajes MaÃ±aneros",
        "description": "Morning messages",
        "format": "s",
        "marker": "RKbBatcX4M4ghwdSrw9LHC5WQns37uPujK",
        "registered": []
    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
biut when i try to register i get an error:

[06-Sep-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "method":"oraclesregister",
"params": ["2779956270435350ef49a4f4f600150b1cb4c266c67312e0f910aba1dae9e01b","1"]
}
```

[06-Sep-18 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "result": {
        "result": "error",
        "error": "couldnt register with oracle txid"
    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:28 PM] TonyL#3577
You have to use datafee amount > than tx fee

[06-Sep-18 12:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
1 is not enough?

[06-Sep-18 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
It's in satoshis

[06-Sep-18 12:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh

[06-Sep-18 12:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
got it

[06-Sep-18 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "method":"oraclesdata",
"params": ["2779956270435350ef49a4f4f600150b1cb4c266c67312e0f910aba1dae9e01b","C4275656e6f732064ed617321"]
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
now this: ```{
    "result": {
        "result": "error",
        "error": "couldnt publish data with oracle txid"
    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you subscribe?

[06-Sep-18 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[06-Sep-18 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Which printout do you receive in daemon log?

[06-Sep-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```datafee must be txfee or more```

[06-Sep-18 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but oraclesdata doesnt ask for fee or amount

[06-Sep-18 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Could you please share printout of `oraclesinfo youroracleid`?

[06-Sep-18 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "result": {
        "result": "success",

[06-Sep-18 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
`"funds": "0.00000000",` - that's the point

[06-Sep-18 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
you have to subscribe first

[06-Sep-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh, not just register...

[06-Sep-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[06-Sep-18 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
`oraclessubscribe oracletxid publisher datafee`

[06-Sep-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[06-Sep-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what is the difference between register and subscribe?

[06-Sep-18 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Register is on the data publisher side - you're setting txfee and registering as the publisher
subscribe is on the data consumer side - you're subscribing for getting the data from this oracle publisher

[06-Sep-18 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a more proper and clear explanation in a JL article above in this channel

[06-Sep-18 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
```A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid. datafee needs to be at least as big as a txfee. Using oraclesregister the current datafee can be updated so a publisher can adapt to market conditions. Once registered, subscribers can prepay for some number of datapoints to a specific publisher using the oraclessubscribe rpc. At first, it is likely that the publisher would pay themselves to enable the posting of initial data points so the potential subscribers can evaluate the quality and consistency of the data.```

[06-Sep-18 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks

[06-Sep-18 12:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but now it seems like i didnt publish anything: ```{
    "method":"oraclessamples",
"params": ["2779956270435350ef49a4f4f600150b1cb4c266c67312e0f910aba1dae9e01b","9e1b592b15afbefa0e391ac7746d030e3a3ca28c602058634c1be81becc891bf","1"]

```{
    "result": {

    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[06-Sep-18 12:56 PM] TonyL#3577
It's sensitive to data input. `C4275656e6f732064ed617321` not looks like a valid data for 's'

[06-Sep-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm, this really confuses me.

[06-Sep-18 12:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im no binary or hex or any other format expert

[06-Sep-18 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
you have to convert your string to hex + amount of symbols in first byte for 's'

[06-Sep-18 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
which text are you trying to send?

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
symbols after being converted to hex?

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or symbols in the original text?

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Symbols in the original text

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so original text is 12 characters

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i added C for that...

[06-Sep-18 12:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
took it from your chart heheheh

[06-Sep-18 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be `0c` since it's a 1 byte declaration

[06-Sep-18 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
1 hex representing 4 binary (bits), 2 bits (1 byte) - 2 hex

[06-Sep-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you just talked math to a dog ðŸ˜‚

[06-Sep-18 01:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
