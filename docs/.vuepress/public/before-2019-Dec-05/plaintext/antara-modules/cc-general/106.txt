you are getting the vins confused with vouts

[02-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
inputs with outputs

[02-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you must own the input to be able to spend it

[02-Oct-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the withdraw must therefore own the tokens to withdraw

[02-Oct-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the tokenconvert must send it to the pubkey doing the withdraw

[02-Oct-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is unclear, you will continue to make donations

[02-Oct-18 03:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so in `tokenconvert` I have to use pubkey which in `-pubkey=` and wallet of node executing withdrawal

[02-Oct-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
tokenconvert converts and transfers

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you might want to transfer to yourself or to someone else

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont own the tokens you cant withdraw them

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, It seems clear now

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if you own them you can send them to anybody

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
dont guess

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
understand clearly

[02-Oct-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810

I'll stop. Now this moment is very clear, thank you!

[02-Oct-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i know there are pubkey parameters for all the rpc calls, but that doesnt mean you can just use $PUBKEY for all of them!

Good day. Can @TonyL 's scipts, cryptoconditions_tui be used with the stakedchain/komodo ?

[03-Oct-18 10:24 AM] CMaurice#1685
to be clear, I don't want to use them yet, just plannning whether I need to have multiple komodod's

[03-Oct-18 10:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi! @CMaurice You can use it with any AC on which CC activated since AC name setting in all functions

Just started to move things to separate "TUIs" repo `cryptoconditions_tui` where will be only TUIs code (in previous one is total mess-up now since in same place not related to TUI scripts)

[03-Oct-18 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@CMaurice You're attentive, since I've made ` cryptoconditions_tui` repo today but not announced anywhere üòÉ

@jl777c I've noticed that in some time on node which I'm using for oraclefeed and most of others calls starting to accumulate transactions in mempool (node in sync and have connections)

Transactions which rejecting with nonstandart transaction input are from oraclefeed:

But mempool cleared on my node after your mining

[03-Oct-18 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I see that "error" on Import TX as well... but apparently it should not be there, because the import TX has no input

[03-Oct-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so maybe its being called when its not meant to be

[03-Oct-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be an early error check, but the fact the mempool wasnt being cleared indicates the nodes that were mining were on a fork

[03-Oct-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
let us get it in sync and see if the problem continues

[03-Oct-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is not some error message about mempool, but that the mempool grows so big

[03-Oct-18 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
It's clearing now, I guess problem was in my mining node. Or in yours not updated mining node hmm

@jl777c in tokens, 1 satoshi is 1 token so fractional units of a token are not possible. But if say 10 satoshis are considered 1 token then the token will be divisible to 1 decimal place. Is this option available in the contract that is currently coded?

you are welcome to interpret the token amounts however you wish

[03-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
but I wont be changing any of the rpc return values

[03-Oct-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is up to the application to display the token amounts however it wants to

Does this seem wrong? Second json is duplicated

[03-Oct-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem strange

[03-Oct-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a bug

[03-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
believe it has to do with registering two different times with same pubkey

[03-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Alright#0419
will get steps to reproduce

shouldnt be able to register for same oracle twice with same pubkey

[03-Oct-18 07:01 PM] Alright#0419
yea that's it. Simple as 
`./orcl oraclesregister b4a8df531ebcbca78669a0a13ce4eb109276172a0c5df6e53c36ee9b527bd221 10000`
then 
`./orcl oraclesregister b4a8df531ebcbca78669a0a13ce4eb109276172a0c5df6e53c36ee9b527bd221 100000000`

[03-Oct-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
was it in the same block?

[03-Oct-18 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
no

[03-Oct-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can register arbitrary number of times?
