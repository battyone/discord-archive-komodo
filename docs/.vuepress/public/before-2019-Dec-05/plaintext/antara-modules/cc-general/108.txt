[05-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
ok, understood

[05-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
but 05FFFFFFFFFF seems to have completely broken the oracle

[05-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
added ones after that and it now gives `error: couldn't parse reply from server` no matter what

[05-Oct-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
a bug?

[05-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Alright#0419
Yes

[05-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Alright#0419
need to see if curl will return something

[05-Oct-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make many test oracles each with a bug duplicated

[05-Oct-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
plz keep track of a list, I will fix them all when I get a chance to revisit oracles

[05-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
same thing with curl btw `{"result":null,"error":{"code":-32700,"message":"Parse error"},"id":null}
`

[05-Oct-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
using the same oraclessamples that worked before

[05-Oct-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
yes I did another `oraclesdata` with known working value

[05-Oct-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
just grabbing the last one works though

[05-Oct-18 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
so `oraclessamples <txid> 1`

[05-Oct-18 09:14 PM] Alright#0419
05FFFFFFFF just breaks it

[05-Oct-18 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the format?

[05-Oct-18 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
s

[05-Oct-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a string

[05-Oct-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
try using valid ascii

[05-Oct-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
a data provider making invalid data samples likely wont get renewals

[05-Oct-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
any way that is my excuse for having almost no error checking

[05-Oct-18 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
üòÉ

[05-Oct-18 09:19 PM] Alright#0419
are the first two bytes length for S?

[05-Oct-18 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Oct-18 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
little endian

[06-Oct-18 11:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to get a faucet cc going. Anyone around that I can ask questions?

I've read through James's "CC made easy" text, and I've read through the `faucet.cpp` file, but am still confused on where to start.

I also checked all the pinned messages, but didn't find anything with a more basic step-by-step for someone with only an intermediate web-dev level of experience.

[06-Oct-18 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
very easy. make sure you have -pubkey= set when you start komodo. make sure this address is new and empty

[06-Oct-18 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There needs to be a facuet on the chain

[06-Oct-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then just do faucetget RPC

[06-Oct-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will let you take 3 faucetgets

[06-Oct-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you need to stop the daemon and start it with a new -pubkey= with a new unused address

[06-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
k, hang on, let me go through this. thank you.

[06-Oct-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you have a chain without a faucet contaract funded obviously you will need to create one and fund it, I have not done that before, but using `komodo-cli help` should give ou the rpc's required

[06-Oct-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all CC contracts output a `hex` value in the JSON, which you need to do a `sendrawtransaction` RPC call to send.

[06-Oct-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need anyhting else and no body is around ping me

[06-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok,

I'm working on a test asset chain that I made myself, so sounds like I need to make my own faucet c

[06-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
cc

[06-Oct-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just check the help, there will be a faucetfund RPC or something similar

[06-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's empty, unfortunately

[06-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's my job to fill it! üòÉ

[06-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB help faucetget
faucetget

siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ 
```

[06-Oct-18 11:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm looking back through James's tutorial... hm...

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was changed, and maybe the docs were not changed also.

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB help`

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@blackjok3r 

If you have time to help on this, it'd be appreciated. I'm not finding anything to indicate how to make a faucet cc, so that you can then use the faucetget rpcs

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and look for the section faucet

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@blackjok3r 

I did. There's nothing there.

[06-Oct-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
help | grep faucet

[06-Oct-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
faucetaddress [pubkey]
faucetfund amount
faucetget

[06-Oct-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you dont have ac_cc enabled

[06-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```

[06-Oct-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so what is wrong with faucetfund?

[06-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB help | grep faucet

```

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Then help commands are empty... though maybe I just need to do git pull

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what more info is needed?

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Um, I'm not on your dev skill level, so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, just to get started.

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I know it may seem obvious to you, but to me it's not

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
did you read the docs that said to faucetfund first?

[06-Oct-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
then faucetget

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes...

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
how can an empty faucet get anything?

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing dev level complicated here

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Well, there's a lot of info about making a pubkey, and something about editing the `faucet.cpp` file

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you are overthinking it

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but it sounds like I don't need to do that

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo-cli faucetfund 1000

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo-cli faucetget

[06-Oct-18 11:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, hang on

[06-Oct-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming you are broadcasting the rawtx with komodo-cli sendrawtransaction <hex>

[06-Oct-18 11:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
now it's asking for the pubkey, and I believe I understand how to get that in there...

[06-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
FYI, this is the part that is confusing me:

I'll see what I can do without help first

```
In order to get the above values, follow these steps:
A. use getnewaddress to get a new address and put that in the <CC>Normaladdr = ""; line
B. use validateaddress <newaddress from A> to get the pubkey, which is put into the <CC>hexstr[67] = ""; line
C. stop the daemon and start with -pubkey=<pubkey from B> and do a <CC>address rpc call. In the console you will get a printout of the hex for the privkey, assuming the if ( 0 ) in Myprivkey() is enabled (CCutils.cpp)
D. update the CCaddress and privkey and dont forget to change the -pubkey= parameter

The first rpc command to add is <CC>address and to do that, add a line to rpcserver.h and update the commands array in rpcserver.cpp
```

[06-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Specifically, how it states, `<CC>Normaladdr = ""`

[06-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That sounds like we need to edit the file...

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want to make faucet2 CC

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
to make a new faucet

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But there's no `Normaladdr` in the `faucet.cpp` file

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, so that's about making a new one

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
requires to make a new facuet with source changes

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
to use the existing faucet, just needs to be funded

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are not expecting it to be so easy

[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
is this your first CC?

[06-Oct-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
there are some universal CC things you need to do like -ac_cc= and -pubkey= and sendrawtransaction of the returned hex

[06-Oct-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
given that context, using the faucet CC is the easiest

[06-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, this is my first, and I'm using this experience to write a CC for web plebs, like me.

[06-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(and more than web plebs, but the idea is to get the docs to be as idiot-proof as I can manage. If I can do it, then so can an idiot!)

[06-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to quote @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  `there will always be a bigger idiot`

[06-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Heh. But I am a pretty good baseline.

[06-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, I did this:

```
siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB getnewaddress
R9e5YDky7ZrGwU8TL5v2TmscLZJMFVs3X8

siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB validateaddress "R9e5YDky7ZrGwU8TL5v2TmscLZJMFVs3X8"
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "R9e5YDky7ZrGwU8TL5v2TmscLZJMFVs3X8",
  "scriptPubKey": "76a91403f346b76c0617b47427a85fb45c01262052aa3488ac",
  "segid": 15,
  "ismine": true,
  "iswatchonly": false,
  "isscript": false,
  "pubkey": "033a7af03e6c2a8199e95a90b46530ea677d2d526258b83ab5561f562cbf4bd08c",
  "iscompressed": true,
  "account": ""
}
```

Then I stopped the daemon, and restarted it using this:
```
./komodod -pubkey="033a7af03e6c2a8199e95a90b46530ea677d2d526258b83ab5561f562cbf4bd08c" -ac_name=AAB -ac_supply=10000 $1 &
```

But I'm getting this:
```
siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAB faucetfund 10 
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet

```

[06-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant use the quotes man

[06-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we found that out early on in Notary season

[06-Oct-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
remove hte " from the pubkey

[06-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I tried without as well...

[06-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
did that first

[06-Oct-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
where is your -ac_cc=2 that enables CC?

[06-Oct-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
a chain that doesnt have CC enabled, doesnt have CC enabled

[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, I had -ac_cc=1...

[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let me go back to my notes

[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_cc=1 will work too
