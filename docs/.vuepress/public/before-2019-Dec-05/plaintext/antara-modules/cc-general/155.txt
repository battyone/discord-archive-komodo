MoMoM is activated for all chains using ac_cc=2 but there are 0 contracts built unpon it as far as I know... Myabe gatewys? but thats still in development too.

[12-Feb-19 10:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

I'm going to catch up the CC docs soon.

Can you please give me the best point of contact for each of the following (I'm taking these from the CC discord list):

cc-gui

cc-lib

cc-assets

cc-coda

cc-coinbase

cc-heir

cc-momom

cc-rogue

cc-sudoku

[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, if there are other CCs that you would like me to start prepping for the front-page facing and user friendly developers.komodoplatform.com , let me know.

[13-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus look at relevant .cpp files in the FSM branch here https://github.com/jl777/komodo/tree/FSM/src/cc

The contributors that are not jl777 or miketout will have some knowledge about the specific CCs you are enquiring about.

Good to know, thank you.

[13-Feb-19 02:49 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Hi all, is there an example transaction  that I can look into where Crypto Conditions are in action in a UTXO?

[13-Feb-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
dimxy for assets and heir, blackjok8r for momom, tonyL for gui at least tui. no need for coda yet. and I guess i would be the one for the others

[13-Feb-19 05:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @jl777c I am doing a research project and summary for my thesis project, and it would be nice if what would the transaction look like when there is CC involved, or am I understanding this incorrectly?

[13-Feb-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Feb-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the cryptoconditions hashes the description of the required conditions and that is used in the OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION script to invoke CC validation

[13-Feb-19 06:13 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Sounds kinda complicated, but thank you very much for this example, I will look and learn more, was planning  actually on developing Election Dapp using the Komodo platform, since one thing that I already liked about this project is that its security using dPOW

[13-Feb-19 06:14 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@jl777c I am writing a summary on what I have researched, might be great if somebody can review it, before I pass it on to my prof

I got this error, when running the faucet CC

[13-Feb-19 08:33 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
```error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet. ERR=-1```

[13-Feb-19 08:34 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I already ran the daemon with the pubkey I got from `validateaddress` rpc call

[13-Feb-19 08:41 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
i jus want to learn to validate ta CC, and how it runs

[13-Feb-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@josephnicholas GMT+8 Could you please share your assetchain params with which you started your daemon? Seems you not set `-pubkey=` param properly

[13-Feb-19 09:05 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@TonyL I need to do an asset chain first? I was thinking of directly using it... So are there any steps to do it?

[13-Feb-19 09:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Cryptoconditions not activated on main KMD chain, so you need to start your own assetchain with activated cryptoconditons or use some existing one  (https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html?params#ac-cc ac_cc param determines if cryptoconditons are activated)
You can follow this guide (just add -ac_cc param):

@TonyL awesome! Thank you very much.

[13-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
You're most welcome! Feel free to drop your questions if you'll have any

[13-Feb-19 09:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually start new blockchain is super simple.
On the first node start daemon like a:
```./komodod -ac_name=GWTEST2 -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 --daemon```
And on the second node:
```./komodod -ac_name=GWTEST2 -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=firstnodeip -gen --daemon```

[13-Feb-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Then just get `pubkey` from validateaddress, restart daemons with valid `-pubkey=` param and you good to go with CC RPC interaction

[13-Feb-19 09:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow, this really neat!!! But will this  be resource intensive (CPU and network) since I am just on an old mac?

[13-Feb-19 09:18 AM] TonyL#3577
If one of your nodes is old Mac it's better to start daemon with `-gen` param on more powerful machine. But it's not resource hungry actually. I'm using old Macbook Air for everyday work and can spin blockchains on it without problems

[13-Feb-19 09:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It only may be a little bit tricky if you want to start multiply nodes blockchain using single PC - there is workaround with separate configs which maybe quite confusing for a fresh mind start. Easiest way is to spin virtual machine for second daemon - but it can slow down your old Mac I wonder

[13-Feb-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
So it might be a good idea to rent VPS or spin cloud instance (for example Google Cloud and AWS offers free trial periods for plays) for usage as a second mining node

[13-Feb-19 09:27 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @TonyL I will try this and rent a VPS....anyway, I have some non CC related question, how do we know if the hash already notarized? Is it when its already mined by BTC miners?

[13-Feb-19 09:31 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
And also, can I run the commands above on the same machine?

[13-Feb-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not a huge dPoW expert. In my understanding notarisation happened when state transaction is on Bitcoin blockchain (other words mined and included to block yes). Somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.

[13-Feb-19 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
You need two separate nodes to issue commands above (blockchain with one node will not work). There is no easy way to make two separate nodes on single machine

[13-Feb-19 09:37 AM] TonyL#3577

[13-Feb-19 09:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @TonyL how about the `ac_cc=2` param?

[13-Feb-19 09:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
what's 2? like it can run 2 smart contracts?

[13-Feb-19 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html?params#ac-cc you'll find the answer here

[13-Feb-19 09:48 AM] TonyL#3577
`ac_cc > 1` using to keep chains in cluster (-ac_cc=2 can interact with other chains with -ac_cc=2)

[13-Feb-19 10:33 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thank you @TonyL

[13-Feb-19 02:38 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@TonyL I have a question

[13-Feb-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Go ahead @josephnicholas GMT+8

[13-Feb-19 02:42 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
on the minig machine what should I look for?

[13-Feb-19 02:43 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Like it said I am missing rpc credintials

[13-Feb-19 02:44 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
and what should I add for the addnode if I am on a VPS?

[13-Feb-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
If first node is your Macbook you have to use public IP of your Macbook in `addnode=` param of second node

[13-Feb-19 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Could you share the full command by which you starting the daemon and error which you're getting?

[13-Feb-19 02:47 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
```azureuser@abe:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli getinfo
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)```

[13-Feb-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
What are you trying to do?

[13-Feb-19 02:49 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So I ran this on my macbook
`./komodod -ac_name=TESTOKEN -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 --daemon`
then on a Azure VPS
`./komodod -ac_name=TESTOKEN -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=<MacbookIP> -gen --daemon`

[13-Feb-19 02:49 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
then I will try to get the pubkey

[13-Feb-19 02:50 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
but I always get the error everytime I do an rpc call with Komodod-cli

[13-Feb-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Issue calls for assetchain as `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTOKEN getinfo`

[13-Feb-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Use -ac_name= in every call for assetchain
./komodo-cli calls without -ac_name param issuing calls to KMD chain daemon - and KMD chain daemon isn't up on your node

[13-Feb-19 02:51 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
azureuser@abe:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTOKEN getinfo
Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay I got it now

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] TonyL#3577
👍  names should match

[13-Feb-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
It's looking for config in `~/.komodo/<ac_name>/<ac_name>.conf`

[13-Feb-19 02:53 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
But I am not adding `addnode` that's okay?

[13-Feb-19 02:53 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, that makes sense, totally new to this stuff

[13-Feb-19 02:53 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So should I wait unti block is 1?

[13-Feb-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, you have to specify `addnode` param only for `komodod` start

[13-Feb-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Could you please share full output of `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTTOKEN getinfo` ?

[13-Feb-19 02:55 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay wait

[13-Feb-19 02:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Just to ensure that your nodes see each other now - there is `connections` param - it should be `1` if nodes connected

[13-Feb-19 02:56 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I did not do anything on `addnode` yet, since I don't know how to have a public address on my mac

[13-Feb-19 02:57 PM] TonyL#3577
`"connections": 0,` - means that nodes aren't connected
I think it's better to do vice versa.
1) Stop daemons now
2) Start daemon on VPS without addnode param
3) Start daemon  on laptop with `-addnode=<ip_of_VPS>` param

[13-Feb-19 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
If your nodes connect each other you'll see ```"connections": 1,``` in getinfo

[13-Feb-19 02:58 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
so the daemon on the laptop mines?

[13-Feb-19 02:58 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
and the VPS doesn't?

[13-Feb-19 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
You can remain `-gen` param on VPS as before

[13-Feb-19 02:58 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
okay2x got it

[13-Feb-19 02:59 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I'll try

[13-Feb-19 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
There might  be limitations / blocking by your firewall and/or router also - don't know configuration of network to which your laptop connected and configuration of firewall on VPS. At least  "p2pport": from getinfo should be opened

[13-Feb-19 03:08 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
still 0 on connections, mayve you are right with firewall

[13-Feb-19 03:10 PM] TonyL#3577
try to `telnet <ip> <p2pport>` both ways

[13-Feb-19 03:11 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
no I can't connect

[13-Feb-19 03:11 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I have no control of this VPS

[13-Feb-19 03:11 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
maybe I will ask admin of my school

[13-Feb-19 03:12 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
but can I now test CC even at block 0?

[13-Feb-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Which komodod daemon version (from which source you downloaded it) are you using?
We may to try to setup blockchain with my VPS as one node and your Macbook as  second node if your Macbook's in network without such network restrictions

[13-Feb-19 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll just run komodod of same version and will provide you params to sync

[13-Feb-19 03:18 PM] TonyL#3577
```"KMDversion": "0.3.3b"``` oh found it in your call. I guess it's this one: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/beta-multios-0.3.3b-beta
