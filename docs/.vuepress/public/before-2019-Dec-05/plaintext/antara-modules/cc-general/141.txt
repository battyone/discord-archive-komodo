So I was able to reproduce with jl FSM

[04-Dec-18 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
You can ensure if sapling activated by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=%ac_name% getblock 62` and then `./komodo-cli -ac_name=%ac_name% getrawtransaction tx^^ 1` - version should be 4

[04-Dec-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry if what I wrote was confusing... I think it must be a sapling thing though... If you need any help to test this I have some time also.

[04-Dec-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh all this test seems to be confusing @blackjok3r I think clue was in some locally saved / cached files or something like this since codebase for both executables is the same

@Mihailo Do you need more help with problem isolating?

[04-Dec-18 12:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL Not right now. I'm trying to determine if sapling broke this and then I'll locate the problem.

[04-Dec-18 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, so it seems that if I do one register on chain which has sapling activated oraclesdata works. But if I do 2 registers (to same publisher with same fee for now) I get
```
cc_verify error C
ERROR: CScriptCheck(): aeb63e8d8efd284c870581cd8ec97f3c479d689c2b4b9ea2cbab23aa786a4012:1 VerifySignature failed: Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element

```

[04-Dec-18 12:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
So I'll check this one first as it seems I found the case when it breaks.

[04-Dec-18 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Please note that two `oraclesregister` creating two publishers with same pubkey and datafee in `oraclesinfo` - maybe this info can help somehow in debug

[04-Dec-18 01:20 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes I know. And the error seems to be about spending the 2nd baton, but have not seen this error by now.

[04-Dec-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright said it was spending the baton ... Glad you have been able to reeporduce this üòÉ

[04-Dec-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL like i said, use an env variable

[04-Dec-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL giving an argument to the script is making it run all tests, and ignore the single test file argument you gave. It's a bug in the shitty (I mean awesome) test code we inherited

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but it's worked as expected for me (give an argument and run single script)
@dukeleto I've made custom connect node https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/blob/unit_tests/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/util.py#L242
In case of https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/blob/unit_tests/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/test_framework.py#L102 And re-arranged code blocks a little bit in `test_framework.py`

[04-Dec-18 04:37 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a prototype so far

[04-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL have you tried giving the argument `--remoteserver` before the filename? Order really matters

[04-Dec-18 04:42 PM] TonyL#3577
So my idea now is to make custom `generate(numblocks)` and call it like a `see_next_block(numblocks)` so in regtest it'll generate numblocks blocks and in case of non regtest chain it'll just wait numblocks

[04-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can never remember how the test suite arguments work, they are not intuitive

[04-Dec-18 04:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto It's worked fine this way: `PYTHON_DEBUG=1  qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions_dice --remoteserver`

[04-Dec-18 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am confused. You said it doesn't. Now it does? :abusedsmily:

[04-Dec-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL VRSC fpga's just jumped on the network, a $2500 fpga can mine around 80 VRSC per day. their price is coming down very fast

[04-Dec-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326

There is no validation on `oraclessubscribe` at the moment: possible to broadcast `oraclessubscribe` even there is no `oraclesregister` (no publishers) for this oracle, possible to broadcast with any random text as a publisher id, possible to subscribe with 0 datafee (not sure if it feature).

There is no oracle with txid `a`. I think these validations might be a root of further problems like we had few days ago

[05-Dec-18 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r Imports of wallets or?

[05-Dec-18 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
coin imports MoMoM transfers

[05-Dec-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least a node on FSM before the verus merge, is incompatible with a version that is after the merge

[05-Dec-18 10:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
regardless if sapling is active yet or not

if this fixes it ... we will just delay launch until sapling activates

[05-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo this is another clue about sapling issues with CC:
CC Eval EVAL_IMPORTCOIN Invalid: invalid-code, dont forget to add EVAL_NEWCC to Eval::Dispatch spending tx bc577596ae240904b6b87b24569571cf10491632049027516f0f5cb5887d8748
All imports are failing on sapling merge with this error ... dont really understand what could be causing it.

[05-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
that indicates that the evalcode is not being extracted properly. so somehow a sapling tx is making CC vout parsing broken (in some cases)

[05-Dec-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c to be clear ... I am on FSM equal branch ... but sapling i NOT avtive yet .. we are usng the default KMD timestamps

[05-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
I have another clue, that two registers do not have anything to do with cc verify error. Sometimes it happens sometimes not...

[05-Dec-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
inconsistent behavior indicates it might be memory corruption or uninitialized variable

[05-Dec-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL can you try a few more oraclesdata please

[05-Dec-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
from my experience, it works 2 or 3 times on a fresh pubkey

[05-Dec-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
then stack element error every time after that

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I've sent a lot of oraclesdata to same oracles these days - never have an issues if there is enough balance and entropy UTXOs

[05-Dec-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try

[05-Dec-18 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@Alright Repeated it

[05-Dec-18 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Trowed an error on 4th `oraclesdata` broadcast

[05-Dec-18 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/bYwd9whc4n/ seems `oraclesdata` ded  at the moment

[05-Dec-18 12:30 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL If you look at the daemon output you will see "cc_verify error C"

[05-Dec-18 12:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
That is the issue with spending baton, but I can`t seem to find a cause why it happens. I thought it was sapling with two registers, but it is not...

[05-Dec-18 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
I didn't do any cases with 2 same publishers and 2 subscribtions

[05-Dec-18 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just registered once and subscribed once

[05-Dec-18 12:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Then broadcasted 1 oraclesdata per block

[05-Dec-18 12:32 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep...

[05-Dec-18 12:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
In my case I think I was able to reproduce it on a fresh chain with first oracle I create and the after when I try it does not happen. But I think that was just a coincidence...

[05-Dec-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not because of sapling

[05-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have CC_EVAL dead on a non sapling chain

[05-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[05-Dec-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire KMDLABS cluster is now dead becasuse of it

lucky its s testnet

[05-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Mihailo#5902

```        default:
            return(ProcessCC(cp,this, vparams, txTo, nIn));
            // only support coinbase guard for now
            if (ecode == EVAL_COINBASEGUARD)
                return(ProcessCC(cp,this, vparams, txTo, nIn));
            break;```
From @miketout  commit that did this.... It might be related to your issues after all @Mihailo  
"// only support coinbase guard for now"
