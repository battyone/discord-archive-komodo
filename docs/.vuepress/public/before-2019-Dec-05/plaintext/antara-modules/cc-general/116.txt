so it is like a utxo linked list, very spooky actually

[17-Oct-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is only backed by trust in the original issuer!

[17-Oct-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
this works as punishment for nonpayment is ranging from being kicked out of the country, or even death

[17-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but we will have locked rewards as secondary security and a global insurance fund (from -ac_perc) to cover the few remaining cases

[17-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the CC will thus enable automated a currently cumbersome and manual process

@Alright I'll put in my to-do for that bug with sharing funds, I have to fix oraclefeed for multisig first...

[17-Oct-18 11:14 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL how is it going?

[17-Oct-18 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Was busy with support inquiries today so far. Will rest a little bit, update my nodes with `oraclesinfo` fix and re-test multisig gateway

[17-Oct-18 11:16 AM] SHossain#0007
nice. we need to get the oracles deeply tested

As I understand oraclesCC deeper testing in #kmdlabs at the moment. We went ahead with Mihailo with GatewayCC testing in case of more that one pubkey usage for binding (multisig)

[17-Oct-18 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
I think that to get oracles `deeply tested` we have to proceed to auto-tests writing and find out if there any bugs in this process. It's taking a lot of time to create different oracles types, publish/read different types of data manually

[17-Oct-18 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007

@Mihailo seems like what happened to you?

[17-Oct-18 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure why he getting these 0.9 instead of 1 since I've created token with 1 supply and converted whole supply 🤕

[17-Oct-18 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Convertion transaction id was `d4c64e03e66e61fd5dab600c6a4ce3368fa7688f65c9b457547abbede528c100`

[17-Oct-18 01:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c @TonyL  I had problem with oracles where the balance was not matching. But this seems the problem on bind...

[17-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
As I see, here seems to be the problem with token supply and total supply in bind command

[17-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
Is there some how we can see the converted tokens balance?

[17-Oct-18 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
I've converted 1 (whole supply) `d4c64e03e66e61fd5dab600c6a4ce3368fa7688f65c9b457547abbede528c100 1.00000000`

[17-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Can you execute tokenbalance for that token and Gateways pubkey

[17-Oct-18 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's using some other txid `check 86174c476c11fd625b438aadd6b2a601100954f37905514f32a0358fb8e7dff9 0.90000000`

[17-Oct-18 01:34 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, I was wondering what those checks are...

[17-Oct-18 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm as I see your command, you gave different tokenid in bind!

[17-Oct-18 01:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Converted tokens aren't tokenCC assets anymore, I guess I can't check it balance

[17-Oct-18 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
This was your token id 4a310e037d4e1355322d4aa47ef7c8071e661d06c74b930e7aa134c396e9b5c0

yes

because in subscribe you put 10000 and it is coins

Yeah, just wrong printout in TUI now

[17-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Mihailo#5902
You need to give it enough amount in subscribe so it can work. If one fee is 10k sat if you give 1 coin it will have enough funds for 1000 oraclefeed posts.

[17-Oct-18 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007

```

[17-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL Not just wrong on TUI, but we should make it uniform on register and subscribe. It is either coins or satoshis.

[17-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
Easy to make a mistake if it is different if some developer using it without TUI.

[17-Oct-18 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, better to have satoshies in both places

[17-Oct-18 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
i thought the value 10000 is already in satoshi

[17-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
@SHossain So you made it correctly now you set register to 10k sat and gave 10k coins for funds so it can work for a long time.

[17-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
But just to understand how it works. Register fee is how much it cost to post data and in subscribe you give funds for that posting

[17-Oct-18 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain TUI just robbed you 😂

rum 

[17-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Mihailo#5902
If you give 100k sat in subscribe on 10k fee it can only  post 10 times and that's it.

[17-Oct-18 02:25 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Yes, in `oraclesregister` setting `datafee` then on each `oraclesdata` this datafee reducing from publisher balance
