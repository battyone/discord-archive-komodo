created a token and placed couple of bid and ask orders.

[26-Aug-18 07:15 PM] SHossain#0007
will fill them

[26-Aug-18 07:17 PM] SHossain#0007
`tokencreate`, `tokenlist`, `tokeninfo`, `tokentransfer`, `tokenbid`, `tokenask`, `tokenbalance`, `tokenfillbid` worked as expected

[26-Aug-18 07:27 PM] SHossain#0007

[26-Aug-18 08:04 PM] SHossain#0007
worked as intended, full fill completed

[26-Aug-18 08:18 PM] SHossain#0007
someone filled another order

[26-Aug-18 08:46 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers did you fill this order earlier on?

[26-Aug-18 08:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[26-Aug-18 08:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but its weird i think, now that i see it.

[26-Aug-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well... not exactly

[26-Aug-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is not the order i filled

[26-Aug-18 08:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it was this: ```        {
            "funcid": "S",
            "txid": "abc1a0d494a4cc7e70e863ff082151c4d9eee50c787e160c04862bcf99f53d35",

[26-Aug-18 08:50 PM] SHossain#0007
you are right

i have not.

[26-Aug-18 08:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i felt it went through just fine.

[26-Aug-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007

In tests for Token CC covered most of the basic cases such as token creating, bid/ask creating and filling and a lot of other manual stuff (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AWSepYrKM-TYGtfVmXN-rwUMSjnuFeTAqhG64vxyvfw/edit?usp=sharing). 
Just execute ```PYTHON_DEBUG=1  qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions --tracerpc``` from `komodo` folder to start the cryptoconditions auto-tests.
There is a tests for faucet and rewards also. Now I'm writing tests for dice and will create same document with covered cases in auto-tests

[26-Aug-18 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i rebased jl777 to dev, you still need to do different things for jl777 branch vs dev

[26-Aug-18 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, there is actual auto-test version in `jl777` so no manipulations needed

[26-Aug-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
were you able to isolate the strange behaviors? not sure if there was any bug there or no

[26-Aug-18 09:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I still can execute things like this `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT7 tokenbalance trololo trololo` or this `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT7 tokentransfer 35587106afb08dafa224ca0ef9e3bb7250c35f2080a46ad0481040afaa072ea2 trololo 10` about which I wrote yesterday

[26-Aug-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems non-consensus issues can can be fixed with rpc error checks

[26-Aug-18 09:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it looks not critical. Just expected different answer when tested so reported

[26-Aug-18 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
plz make sure the docs are updated so the answer is expected

[26-Aug-18 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Alright, I'll add these cases to Token CC test plan doc so later we'll able to add more parameters checks.

[26-Aug-18 10:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL where are you writing your tests?

[26-Aug-18 10:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a bunch of changes coming down the line

[26-Aug-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have modified the c++ code to return status codes for dice rpcs

[26-Aug-18 10:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also have added code to validate plan names and token names

[26-Aug-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
improved error messages in a few places

[26-Aug-18 10:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
it was only returning status codes for successful results, made all the error cases also return that

[26-Aug-18 10:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it would be good to fill same tables for faucet/rewards test to give a picture what actually testing to whom who will use these tests

[26-Aug-18 10:32 PM] TonyL#3577
So manual job can be done with these test and time can be spend on more exotic cases trying

if you want to, nobody will stop you üòÉ

[26-Aug-18 10:33 PM] TonyL#3577

[26-Aug-18 10:35 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto  So I'll wait for your PR, will grab changes and doublecheck if I have to change something in my bets tests according to new statuses and then PR my new tests  üëç

[26-Aug-18 10:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
it should make it easier for you

[26-Aug-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
because you can use `assert_(error|success)(result)`

[26-Aug-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
please also add some tests for invalid names, i.e. dice plans longer than 8 characters

[26-Aug-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
i only added it a few places, you will see an example test that you can apply to all rpc's

{Reactions}
üëå 

[26-Aug-18 10:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, for invalid token names, which are allowed to be 32 chars

[26-Aug-18 10:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am thinking that splitting the tests into 4 files might be  a good idea, but one downside is that it will take about 4 times as long to run all tests, because each test has to mine 101 blocks, which take roughly 1 sec/each.

[26-Aug-18 10:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
so I guess I am still on the fence

[26-Aug-18 10:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, I don't think Travis CI is actually running our cctests, it's just making sure stuff builds

[26-Aug-18 10:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks like nobody using it atm üòÉ

[26-Aug-18 10:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And looks like it's very good to place such 8 chars limitation for dice plan name, since I can create 0 blocks timeout plan in case of long name usage

[26-Aug-18 10:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
gonna make that PR now, stuff finally passes

[26-Aug-18 10:48 PM] dukeleto#7326

and when I try to submit to dev branch now, it's including all kinds of weird stuff

[26-Aug-18 10:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
cherry-picking 2 commits onto a new branch based on `dev` saved me

Hi @CrisF If you want to participate in CC testing on AT7 ac_chain you have to use jl777 branch since it'll be most updatable these days.

@Anthony

[27-Aug-18 12:11 PM] Anthony#6143
Per crypto conditions, wondering if inheritance will be or perhaps is implemented? Where functions can be preserved and called on later.

[27-Aug-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
what exactly do you mean. "inheritance" does not exist in the crypto conditions standard

[27-Aug-18 12:28 PM] Anthony#6143
Solidity is built with inheritance, calling on the properties of a parent contract without having to redefine them all.

[27-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Anthony#6143
The question is if with crypto conditions, if it will be built with the ability to inherit properties or functions from other cc contracts

[27-Aug-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
please keep in mind that utxo based CC contracts are a totally different animal than solidity. That being said, you can write one CC contract that knows about another CC contract and in essence be invoking it

[27-Aug-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
for example there is the assets CC that allows to issue and trade tokens. Another contract could issue tokens and then use the newly issued token as trigger conditions for invoking the payments CC contract.

[27-Aug-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the way to view it is that each CC contract adds more functionality to a blockchain, which in turn can be used by users directly or by other contracts

[27-Aug-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not direct source level inheritance

[27-Aug-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I have explained in detail how the CC contracts work. It is a good idea to not have preconceptions and start with a fresh mind: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/CC%20made%20easy

It is about 1300 lines of code to roll the dice in your example with CC, with solidity you can do it in 200 lines because you can call on the function that was written prior about rolling dice by someone else

[27-Aug-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, solidity is a higher level language than the C code I wrote

[27-Aug-18 12:36 PM] Anthony#6143
So I was asking if it is or will be possible to consolidate code and preserve code already written so it can be called on by someone in the future

that is not to say a less line count CC contract cant be done by ahigher level language

[27-Aug-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the way for that is to make reusable functions, like in CCutils.cpp, and eventually we should have a library of functions to do standard things

[27-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Anthony#6143
So what I see is that crypto conditions is in addition to blockchain consensus

[27-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Anthony#6143
the code is programmed into the blockchain etc

plz keep in mind these are the initial 4 CC contracts, very early in the lifecycle and rather than try to reduce the lines of code, I made each one have no dependencies on any other, that way the entirety of what is needed is seen
