it did get an error trying to spend the marker vout, forgot to importprivkey for the gateway address

[25-Sep-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed fix to gatewaysmarkdone, also you need to import the wif for the gateways normal address in the oraclefeed node. it is also needing more funds as oracledata is not finding any funds, so do an oraclessubscribe

[25-Sep-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I can tell, the withdraw worked

```
Business case how to:
 1 - Create your blockchain using Komodo’s Assetchain
 2 - Create tokens for on-chain representation of real world assets
 3 - Convert tokens to gateway enforcement (so they can be redeemed when “cashed out”)
 4 - Create an oracle (used to maintain the price feed of the real world asset onto the blockchain)
 5 - Bind the token and gateway to the oracle so prices reflect accurate data on-chain when fed updates
 6 - Use the sample “Oracle Feed” dApp to feed the accurate pricing from the real world to on-chain data
 7 - Use the gateway to redeem (cashout) the token value when customer requests
```
@jl777c @TonyL 👆 does this simplify the "Token, Gateway & Oracle" solution for tradeable and cash-out-able  tokens.  Whether they are other crypto, real world assets etc.   i used tony's pad notes.

[25-Sep-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC requires a bitcoin protocol coin

[25-Sep-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but given a manual gateway, the same effect can be achieved. There can be a chicken gateway, where tokens are issued when chickens are deposited. and chickens are delivered when the tokens are delivered

[25-Sep-18 01:24 PM] Mylo#8306
cool i was hoping to stretch it to chickens or chicken-representatives, thanks!

[25-Sep-18 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
I've bought a Raspberri PI  - now thinking which "IOT like" stuff better to connect to make some dope demonstration for oracles - can make some custom oraclesfeed which will just grab data from my device/file. But all my ideas so far got not much practical sense. @Mylo If you have some ideas on this matter - I may try to implement). I think I may start from temperature to chain or try to implement some cases with data transfer/proofing from IP cameras

[25-Sep-18 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c  great that it's work! Looks like it's possible now to make all or almost all flow if be gentle. Just came home - will re-test deposit now and proceed to automation

[25-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Mylo#8306
With temperature, there’s your telemetry info for supply chain.
GPS coordinates for fishing cross reference data.  Motion sensor for fallen over alarm for healthcare or fence/perimeter for prison.
Maybe gauge for electricity supply/use is better and you can make your own crypto electric bills which would work well for an off-grid economy using PoS.

[25-Sep-18 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo Great! Had same idea with motion sensor - wanna call it "proof of penetration", may be usable in pornography as well 😂

[25-Sep-18 04:48 PM] Mylo#8306
But for your PC (not Pi) use `dmidecode` and get fan RPM and oracle-ize it !

so BTC token mempool tx secured by dPoW!

[25-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Mylo#8306
Oh gosh...that’s a non doublespendable instant payment channel for any bitcoin protocol coin (or anything gateway-able, including chickens) and it is arguably “streamable” using existing infrastructure like explorers.

[25-Sep-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[25-Sep-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not bad for a couple months work on CC

[26-Sep-18 06:04 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c is it ok that for a new gateway (but created from the same pubkey) deposit address is the same - means it's const on AC for pubkey?

Also - what is the best solution in situation like this? (can't gatewaysdeposit because no height in oracle) Have I revoke deposit somehow or add merkleroot data manually? 

I just wonder that might be very useful to add some argument/parameter to `oraclefeed` to get merkleroot for "desired" height. It's quite easy to miss one height let's say because of network instability which can cause some missed deposits

By some reason have a gap right on needed place, guess restarted the tool this moment :/

hey @TonyL you want another ridiculous locking utxo product to make?  i'll give you an idea.   first one is free.... an IDE where each character in a source file can be locked, so the escaped backslash \ in a curl script can't be deleted.  it will save devops engineers loads of cumulative hours worldwide.

Heey @Mylo I'm in love with DevOps culture but not sure if my coding skills are enough for IDE making on this stage 😂
