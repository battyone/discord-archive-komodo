ok. got it. the order was for 10,000. you filled 100. it was supposed to show `s` with the remaining required balance 9900

[15-Aug-18 09:43 PM] SHossain#0007
but it was changed to `S`

[15-Aug-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes an initial sell is 's', a partial fill changes it is 'S' as that came as change from a fillask

[15-Aug-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the way it works

[15-Aug-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
same for 'b'

[15-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Alright#0419
How can we tell if it's a tokenfillask or tokenask?

[15-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Alright#0419
`s` means someone is offering tokens for native coins, `S` means the opposite no?

[15-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Alright#0419
`S` would be an overfilled `tokenfillask`, right?

[15-Aug-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that was my understanding too

[15-Aug-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
overfill would make the change

[15-Aug-18 09:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i fulfilled this order
```
        {
            "funcid": "S",
            "txid": "36da1dd6a7eec6b8c4de3621b982fa146dc5bd111992a73fd34fedb317c09ff2",

            "amount": "9800",
            "askamount": "9800",
            "origaddress": "RLSgpvHqCYpkuHmSESZHqoDD2ssZrVtu1m",
            "tokenid": "94b5dd0c386916b8e09c1f66bdf7a66f9fe43561c0876578bceaa9b5bb106cba",
            "totalrequired": "41160.00000000",
            "price": "4.20000000"
        }
```

[15-Aug-18 09:47 PM] SHossain#0007
using tokenfillask

[15-Aug-18 09:48 PM] SHossain#0007
this entry now disappeared from orderbook

[15-Aug-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
overfill would leave no sell left

[15-Aug-18 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
partial fill leaves some left and so 's' -> 'S" or 'S' -> 'S;

[15-Aug-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is overfilled or exactly filled, it disappears

[15-Aug-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is any left, it needs to stay on the orderbook

[15-Aug-18 09:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and I made both 's' and 'S' tx be mostly alike

[15-Aug-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so the same logic to fill an 's' can be used for 'S'

[15-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Alright#0419
Ah the way I was looking at it, if I saw `s` I needed to do `tokenfillask` and if I saw `S`, I needed to do `tokenask`

[15-Aug-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright there are some bid orders now

[15-Aug-18 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
please test partial fill, full fill, over fill

[15-Aug-18 10:06 PM] SHossain#0007
full fill worked for me

[15-Aug-18 11:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Token orders should add token name if possible

[15-Aug-18 11:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i know token id is the real name, but for eyes sake it should also have the token name

[15-Aug-18 11:33 PM] SHossain#0007

i guess GUI will have to do that based on `tokenid`

[15-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
Please no one test `rewardsunlock` on the first plan on AT5

[15-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
if you have to test it, test it on your own plan please

[15-Aug-18 11:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@SHossain but that would make a once call process a 2 call process.... wont it?

[15-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Alright#0419
I think it would help to add the name of the coin after each amount that is denominated in native coins for assets

One thing I found is that if you try to do `tokenaskfill` on a `tokenbid` you get a `dust` error

[16-Aug-18 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto could you add an error message for that?

[16-Aug-18 05:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright sure, what would you prefer is returned?

[16-Aug-18 05:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright is that where you are using the wrong txid for the RPC function?

[16-Aug-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI will have to remember tokenid ->name

[16-Aug-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt see any bugs posted, formal or anecdotal. I guess I will start working on the next round of CC contracts. have some pretty crazy ideas, not sure all of them will work

ok, I figured out how to do micropayments, well actually mempool based payments that is secure

[16-Aug-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I think that will be the next one to do

[16-Aug-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and really, it isnt limited to small payments, it can work with any size

[16-Aug-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but I think I will limit it to 32-bits of 0.0001 denomination -> 4 billion  / 10000 -> 400,000 would be the max payment

[16-Aug-18 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😱 I want micropayments!!!!

[16-Aug-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
seems in Sept timeframe I can get it ready, barring bug barrage from existing codes

[16-Aug-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you explain a bit on difference between your idea of micropayments and lightening network ?

[16-Aug-18 10:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from your point of view ?

[16-Aug-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
mine is a simple approach that most people should be able to understand. no crazy complicated bidirectional channel scripts. it is also a direct p2p approach, so you need to specifically reserve funds for specific payee

[16-Aug-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a good tradeoff as I dont have 3 years to get a micropayments system working, I want to be done in 3 weeks

[16-Aug-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
The way it will work is you lock funds into a payments address. this can be added to whenever, using similar concepts to the faucetfunding/rewardsfunding
