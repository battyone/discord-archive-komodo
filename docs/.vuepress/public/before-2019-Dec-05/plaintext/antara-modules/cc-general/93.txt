Oh, that is great!

[12-Sep-18 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c I've noticed that it's possible to subscribe/register on oracle even if oracle creation txid isn't mined yet (in mempool). Should I consider it as an expected behaviour?

[12-Sep-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as no ill effect, it seems ok

update oraclesdata so more than one oraclesdata can be posted each block, if there are enough utxos

[12-Sep-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i had to get this working so that assetchains can keep up with posting one merkleroot per block, as it was both KMD and assetchains are on a one minute per block, but if any delay error, the posting side falls behind, so gradually it ended up being way behind

[12-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC is now ready for automated deposits, there now is a working oraclefeed to write the KMD merkleroots onchain

[12-Sep-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
to get the merkleroots onchain, from the multisig signers nodes run the oraclefeed program with acname oracletxid pubkey Ihh
 ./oraclefeed AT5 1f1aefcca2bdea8196cfd77337fb21de22d200ddea977c2f9e8742c55829d808 02ebc786cb83de8dc3922ab83c21f3f8a2f3216940c3bf9da43ce39e2a3a882c92 Ihh

[12-Sep-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
run that from the node(s) that are able to sign the multisig/only gateway deposit address

[12-Sep-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is running, it will write the (height, blockhash, merkleroot) each block (for now 10 blocks behind)

[12-Sep-18 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh just wrote script to send only one oraclesdata per block and no limitation now so now may try to send the all file lines in one block , yahooo

[12-Sep-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you will need 1 utxo per pending oraclesdata

[12-Sep-18 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
utxo on oraclescontract or my wallet?

[12-Sep-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
oraclessubscribe utxos

[12-Sep-18 12:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! Will add utxos creation to oracles preparation step. Can I send as much as I want `oraclessubscribe` in one block?

[12-Sep-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, well limited by blocksize

[12-Sep-18 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Is blocksize allows to send ~1000 txs atm in one block?

[12-Sep-18 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Used this num as a limit when tested

[12-Sep-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
5000 or so

[12-Sep-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on tx size

[12-Sep-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
2MB blocksize

[12-Sep-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the oraclefeed was updated so it stays 10 blocks behind KMD

[12-Sep-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
which is in lieu of checking for notarization. for now good enough which means until 10 blocks after the KMD deposit, the gatewaysdeposit will get an error as it wont be able to find the merkleroot

[12-Sep-18 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Still can't send two `oraclesdata` in same block - no matters how many `oraclessubscribe` creating.
For a second data broadcasting (rawtransaction sending) receiving:
```error code: -25
error message:``` 
(nothing in daemon logs)

[12-Sep-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to wait for the first oraclesdata to get into mempool before calling the second oraclesdata

[12-Sep-18 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes it's in mempool when I'm calling second one

[12-Sep-18 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577

look at the vins for the tx that is getting error -25

[12-Sep-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
find which one is already spent and let me know

[12-Sep-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
oraclefeed.c is doing oraclesdata with the baton in the mempool

[12-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe try FSM branch, it is slightlymore recent

[12-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
also FSM branch now has gatewayswithdraw and gatewayspending

[12-Sep-18 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the only thing left is for the signing nodes to process the withdraws, without double withdrawing

There is a 3 vins for this transaction with error.
First vin is a previous oraclesdata transaction which in mempool
Second vin is a current oracle batontxid
Third vin is a previously successfully published data
`gettxout 0` returns data for all of these 3 vins. 
Is it correct way to check is it spent?

[12-Sep-18 03:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Will build latest FSM and try the same

[12-Sep-18 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
then that is not the reason for error. what does the console print

[12-Sep-18 03:56 PM] TonyL#3577
there is nothing except of ```error code: -25
error message:```

[12-Sep-18 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
does oraclefeed work for you?

[12-Sep-18 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try `oraclesfeed`

[12-Sep-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the c program in dapps

[12-Sep-18 04:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep I've tested it before. Now it's just hangs and don't do any printouts after I input parameters

[12-Sep-18 04:18 PM] TonyL#3577

[12-Sep-18 04:22 PM] TonyL#3577
`gcc oraclefeed.c -lm -o oracle_dapp` built it this way and placed with same folder with komodo-cli since it's trying to execute it like it's in same folder with it

[12-Sep-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I only tested Ihh mode

[12-Sep-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe L mode is broken

[12-Sep-18 04:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think there are a couple of modes broken.

[12-Sep-18 04:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
s and S too

[12-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
oraclefeed only has 2 mode

[12-Sep-18 04:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Before tested on `L` (worked for me) now used same oracle/pubkey with which tested before.
Let me try `lhh`

[12-Sep-18 04:29 PM] TonyL#3577
On latest FSM branch oraclesfeed with same parameters as above hangs as well

[12-Sep-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
Ihh <- uppercase i

[12-Sep-18 04:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, yep `if ( strncmp(format,"Ihh",3) != 0 && format[0] != 'L' )`

[12-Sep-18 04:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Missed this format announcement

[12-Sep-18 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577

ok, for now stay with one per block. i cant duplicate it and still debugging withdraw processing

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜¦ 

[12-Sep-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu - Chainmakers i verified that gatewayCC does deposit and withdraw, you do need to have KMD with addressindex=1 and spentindex=1

[12-Sep-18 07:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the komodo daemon needs to also be run with addressindex and spentindex?

[12-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
running oraclefeed.c as a standalone with the appropriate params takes care of all the processing needed by the non-msig deposit address owner

[12-Sep-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes KMD itself needs to be fully cross indexed

[12-Sep-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
once you setup a gateway, you will have all the parameters needed for oraclefeed

[12-Sep-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it will write the merkleroots and also process withdraws

[12-Sep-18 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm that might make me require a new setup

[12-Sep-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
validation is not done yet, so you have to be nice to it

[12-Sep-18 08:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is in FSM branch?

[12-Sep-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777

[12-Sep-18 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[12-Sep-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no need to run komodo with pubkey too?

[12-Sep-18 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
o do i need to run KMD as if im going to use cc with it?

[12-Sep-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
no need on the KMD side, but the privkey for the deposit address needs to be in the wallet

[12-Sep-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it just finally got working in a single case, so clearly can still have bugs

[12-Sep-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
its only 3 days since I started coding it, so plz be nice to it

[12-Sep-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
once we get it working solid in the simple cases, we can start trying to abuse it and steal from it

[12-Sep-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the asset that is gatewaysbind to the KMD represents KMD 1:1

[12-Sep-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so if any of the assets can be obtained without depositing KMD, that is a bad bug needs to be fixed

[12-Sep-18 08:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the komodo daemon and the gateway CC assetchain need to be in the same server?

[12-Sep-18 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just started reindexing komodo daemon in my test server

[12-Sep-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[12-Sep-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be anywhere

[12-Sep-18 08:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[12-Sep-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the gatewaysdeposit is the big ugly rpc that proves the KMD deposit was made

[12-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to use the KMD daemon to get the txproof and then submit it on the assetchain

[12-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is more convenient on a single node

[12-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can copy/paste, getting the right values is what matters

[12-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c In channel CC , validation of secret should be done to see does it reach the final hashchain or else funds will be unspendable, but in usual cases the initial secret will only be revealed after sender release all the payments. So  we should rely on ChannelOpen RPC that it has done the correct job?

[12-Sep-18 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im just getting out of the office... will test once the daemon syncs.

[12-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
For ChannelPayment we can iterate the secret n amount of times and compare with hashchain

[12-Sep-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, channelopen must be bugfree
