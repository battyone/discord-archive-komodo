yes

[01-Nov-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
then given a set of pubkeys, any changes need the majority of those pubkeys

[01-Nov-19 02:19 PM] dimxy#2587
okay

[02-Nov-19 05:47 PM] dimxy#2587
And what is actually a `player attested balance`? 
Is it a value in some transaction's opreturn or is it an nValue on tx output?
In which chain is this tx, in the CHIPS or in the pegged chain?

[02-Nov-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is balances updated offchain and submitted to the cashier chain

[02-Nov-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the attested signatures would be an opreturn args

[02-Nov-19 05:52 PM] dimxy#2587
so it is a multi-signed message with an amount which is stored in an opreturn

[02-Nov-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Nov-19 08:02 PM] dimxy#2587
I think we need to work out a common structure for such messages and its placement in the opreturn (so it won't be an ad-hoc solution but a unified format). 
I think it could be a signed json, better to use a standard like rfc7515 for signing. Then we could use arbitrary messages in various FSM events and access message values from event expressions in a unified way (like by json pointer rfc)

[02-Nov-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds good

[03-Nov-19 10:38 PM] Regnar#6164
So I'm trying to take stock of the different proof of concepts being created with Komodo CCs and update the 3rd party docs page with links to them. The goal is to have a single link we can share with people who are interested in the types of things that are being or can be built with CCs.

[03-Nov-19 10:40 PM] Regnar#6164
I've kind of spammed the CC channels with the same call for people to post the PoCs for me so I can add them on Github, I spent a while going through the history of each channel to try and collect the information before I asked, so if it isn't already on the list I posted in the channels, feel free to post it and tag me!

Also would like to make simple reference GUIs for Modules that don't have any.
Something that can be used for demoing possibilities of what the individual Modules can do.

@PHBA2061 has started a great example for Tokens here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/524538792644837376/638344145265623041 and @Regnar has started on an example Token Marketplace here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/524538792644837376/640627767414751235 .

I have made a Trello for the Assets Module progress, and if that proves useful it can be used as a template for work on other Modules.  Please add to it and start checking things off the list.

End-to-end encrypted, onion-routed, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer instant messaging over Lightning - joostjager/whatsat

[04-Nov-19 04:39 AM] Regnar#6164
pretty cool idea using lightning for encrypted messaging 
`Recent changes to the protocol made it possible to attach arbitrary data to a payment. This demo leverages that by attaching a text message and a sender signature.

A Lightning payment delivers the message, but no actual money is paid. Because the sender uses a random payment hash, the receiver is not able to settle the payment. The failure message that is returned to the sender serves as a delivery confirmation.

This means that chatting is currently free. However, there is a future in which 'free failures' don't exist anymore. Nodes may start charging a prepaid relay fee and/or start rate limiting sources that produce too many failures. In that case, chatting over Lightning may switch to actually settling the messaging payments and dropping off a few millisats at every hop.`

[04-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
same thing can be accomplished with oracles CC

[04-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Alright#0419
can read data from mempool before they're confirmed

[04-Nov-19 10:11 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I have 1 question related to this <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-4.html#attaching-data-to-tokens>
```
Advanced developers can even add functionality to allow the tokens to gain new data over time as they are passed through transactions.
```
Can anyone please elaborate a bit on what functionality needs to be added in order to change tokens data ?

the details would depend on what exactly you want to do

[05-Nov-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
you can link together two arbitrary txids (via oracles or other methods)

[05-Nov-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if you make a custom CC, then anything is possible

[05-Nov-19 08:36 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thanks for the answer üëç

This is an update for FSM CC specification.
It has close to complete FSM artefact set (while it is an early draft, of course) and has 2 examples how to implement existing cc with it.
It has a description for json structure defining FSM states, events and transitions.
The complicated thing in this is expressions which could be embedded into a fsm definition and will be evaluated by FSM CC module.
With the expressions it is possible to define logical conditions or action to enable/disable a transition or check if a event occured or make some actions on blockchain artefacts.
The goal of this is to allow by developing just fsm json definitions, with no coding, to create various new CC applications based on the single FSM CC module.
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/wiki/Designing-RPC-for-FSM-CC
I'm trying to borrow concepts from UML State Diagram (believing that it is a well-defined and consistent framework).
---
If all this is close to what we want to have as a FSM module, the next steps could be to create more example definitions to get to the point when the specification becomes stable and artefacts reusable, so it would not need to extend it more and more for each new task.

@dimxy excellent start! we need to get specific feedback from other CC devs, but i think having some reference fsm created will help others understand this much better. great work!

[06-Nov-19 02:55 PM] dimxy#2587
Thank you, now I'll try to model payments with this

@PHBA2061 for browser rpc, putting a CORS proxy in front of MORTY.
The rpc url will need to be modded so it looks like `http://proxy.url:port/http://morty.url:port/`

I‚Äôve used https://github.com/imylomylo/cors-anywhere no probs

CORS Anywhere is a NodeJS reverse proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request. - imylomylo/cors-anywhere

I was looking at your repo PHBA, and <https://nuxtjs.org/faq/http-proxy/> seemed like the easiest solution as you were using nuxt already

[16-Nov-19 11:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530
thank you both, the proxy solution was what I've been working on during the past few days, I made my own custom proxy based on expressjs though, I'll push an update soon today üòÉ

I just pushed some updates to my app:
- get rid of the CORS problem, so you can run the app normally on the browser.
- adding some functionalities like token transferring, ask/bid orders placing/filling (based on the existing RPC methods) which allow users to trade their tokens.
- I placed some orders selling my Pok√©mon at 1 MORTY per token, anyone is welcome to buy it ... üòÇ
- I didn't really focus on UX, so the app might be a bit messy

@gcharang I‚Äôll check out that proxy setting, might make things easier for other Vue projects/components .  Let you know in a cpl weeks.  Not on my urgency list and only doing 4hrs screen time max per day atm.

@PHBA2061 Nice work removing CORS.   I‚Äôll look at dockerizing your app in the same cpl week timeframe.

[18-Nov-19 02:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@Mylo something to keep in mind is that,  that proxy setting (<https://nuxtjs.org/faq/http-proxy/>) works only for ssr mode and not for static mode
PHBA's solution is very similar to cors-anywhere
except, it uses express as the proxy server in between

there is no removing CORS lol, there is only removing CORS problems üôÇ 
in the case of localhost to localhost comms,  we can have a local proxy server (cors-anywhere or PHBA's express based one) to act as an inbetween for communicating with the Komodo daemon as it doesn't reply with the proper CORS headers which the browsers look for as a security policy

if we are dealing with an internet API that doesn't set CORS properly, we can have a similar proxy server hosted on a VPS to act as a go between for communicating with the particular API
 <https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/> is a demo of that kind of usage

[18-Nov-19 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah rob w‚Äôs is who I forked.

Express CORS proxy, yeah I did same thing for nodejs mmbot github.com/imylomylo/node-cors-server/blob/master/index.js for Initial GUI work before the bot was developed.  This too didn‚Äôt respond with CORS headers, but for my dev env I simply made an ssh tunnel from CORS to wherever the bot was.  One proxy, several docker bots

Thanks for info re SSR vs other.  I‚Äôm not familiar with nuxt - a case of too many frameworks to learn their opinionated ways of doing things üôÉ but if I can make work with sample apps and remove CORS-anywhere, more power to me!

I‚Äôm likely to pick up nspv in 2020 for the longer term investigation in any event.

I forgot to mention that I used this npm package cors in conjunction with express <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors>, not only to add the Allow-Cross-Origin header to komodo RPC responses, but also to responses from an external API where I pull the Pok√©mon images & descriptions.

[27-Nov-19 01:57 AM] Mylo#8306
@PHBA2061 def will work on docker image next week.  How‚Äôs dev going?
What is difference between dex & master?

[27-Nov-19 02:15 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm a bit busy on learning stuffs so didn't make any progress on the Pok√©mon web app üòÖ , the difference between `dex` & `master` is `dex` has the latest features (no cors issue, token trading feature), I will merge dex to master when I have time

[27-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Mylo#8306
Cool man, no pressure.  That‚Äôs enough details for me to work with next week.  Happy learning!!

no

[29-Nov-19 11:35 AM] PHBA2061#2530
& is there a reason why it isn't ?

[29-Nov-19 11:39 AM] gcharang#6833
there are plans for a cc enabled side chain for KMD
this will leave the main chain uncluttered for the normal payments usecase and notarizations
