Yep, sure

[05-Sep-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
there are numerical sizes 1, 2, 4, 8

[05-Sep-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
signed and unsigned as described in the oracles.cpp comments

[05-Sep-18 06:56 PM] TonyL#3577
```
" The format string is a set of chars with the following meaning:
  's' -> <256 char string
  'S' -> <65536 char string
  'c' -> 1 byte signed little endian number, 'C' unsigned
  't' -> 2 byte signed little endian number, 'T' unsigned
  'i' -> 4 byte signed little endian number, 'I' unsigned
  'l' -> 8 byte signed little endian number, 'L' unsigned
  uppercase is unsigned, lowercase is a signed number
"```
Using this table

[05-Sep-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

Kim dot com had an idea of a file sharing site
There ppl upload files, it gives encrypted link etc
Downloaders have to pay btc to get the link and download files
Uploaders earn btc through this service and kim being middle person earns percent of these earnings.

[06-Sep-18 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wonder how can this be done via CC

[06-Sep-18 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Channel CC can be used for text content I think. 🤔

[06-Sep-18 03:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Text content saved in the tx

[06-Sep-18 03:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, it’s a reveal a partial secret based on payment

[06-Sep-18 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
channel CC is for the payments side, content storage requires a different CC

[06-Sep-18 05:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

Chapter 11 - oracles example
Oracles CC is an example where it ended up being simpler than I first expected, but at the same time a lot more powerful. It is one of the smaller CC, but it enables creation of an arbitrary number of data markets, in a performant way.

In order to gain the performance, some clever usage of special addresses was needed. It was a bit tricky to generate a special address to keep track of the latest data.

Let's back up to the beginning. Just what is an oracle? In this context it is something that puts data that is not on the blockchain, onto the blockchain. Since everything other than the transactions and blocks are not in the blockchain, there is a very large universe of data that can be oracle-ized. It can be literally anything, from the obvious like prices to specific results relative to an arbitrary description.

The most difficult issue about oracles is that they need to be trusted to various degree to provide accurate and timely data. The danger is that if a trusted node is used to write data to the blockchain, it creates a trust point and a single point of attack. Ultimately there is nothing that can ensure only valid data is written to the blockchain, so what is done is to reinforce good behavior via pay per datapoint. However, for critical data, higher level processing is needed that combines multiple data providers into a validated signal.

At the oracles CC level, it is enough that there is financial incentive to provide good data. Also it is needed to allow multiple vendors for each data that is required and to enable efficient ways to update and query the data.

[06-Sep-18 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
The following are the rpc calls:
oraclescreate name description format
oracleslist
oraclesinfo oracletxid
oraclesregister oracletxid datafee
oraclessubscribe oracletxid publisher amount
oraclesdata oracletxid hexstr
oraclessamples oracletxid batonutxo num

The first step is to create a specific data description with oraclescreate, which also defines the format of the binary data. This creates an oracletxid, which is used in the other rpc calls. name and description are just arbitrary strings, with name preferably being a short name used to access the data. The format is a string comprised of a single character per data element:

  's' -> <256 char string
  'S' -> <65536 char string
  'd' -> <256 binary data
  'D' -> <65536 binary data
  'c' -> 1 byte signed little endian number, 'C' unsigned
  't' -> 2 byte signed little endian number, 'T' unsigned
  'i' -> 4 byte signed little endian number, 'I' unsigned
  'l' -> 8 byte signed little endian number, 'L' unsigned
  'h' -> 32 byte hash

For example, if the datapoint is comprised of a 4byte timestamp and an 8byte number the format string would be: "IL"

oracleslist displays a list of all the oraclestxid and oraclesinfo displays information about the specific oracletxid. Each oracletxid deterministically generates a marker address and a small amount is sent to that address to mark a transaction's relation to the oracltxid.

[06-Sep-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810

      "funds": "0.01000000",
      "datafee": "0.01000000"
    }
  ]
}

A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid. datafee needs to be at least as big as a txfee. Using oraclesregister the current datafee can be updated so a publisher can adapt to market conditions. Once registered, subscribers can prepay for some number of datapoints to a specific publisher using the oraclessubscribe rpc. At first, it is likely that the publisher would pay themselves to enable the posting of initial data points so the potential subscribers can evaluate the quality and consistency of the data.

The one final rpc is oraclessamples, which returns the most recent samples of data from a specific publisher. In order to have a performant solution to track all the potential data streams from all the publishers for all the oracletxid, a baton utxo is used. This is an output sent to a specific address and expected to have just a single utxo at any given time to allow for direct lookup. oraclessamples requires a starting txid to use and with each datapoint having the prior batontxid, there is a reverse linked list to traverse the most recent data.

[06-Sep-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
In order to implement this, the following vin/vout contraints are used:

 create:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: txfee tag to oracle normal address
 vout.1: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with name and description and format for data
 
 register:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: txfee tag to normal marker address
 vout.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.2: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with oracletxid, pubkey and price per data point
 
 subscribe:
 vins.*: normal inputs
 vout.0: subscription fee to publishers CC address
 vout.1: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with oracletxid, registered provider's pubkey, amount
 
 data:
 vin.0: normal input
 vin.1: baton CC utxo (most of the time)
 vin.2+: subscription or data vout.0
 vout.0: change to publishers CC address
 vout.1: baton CC utxo
 vout.2: payment for dataprovider
 vout.3: change, if any
 vout.n-1: opreturn with oracletxid, prevbatontxid and data in proper format
 
The oraclesdata transaction is the most complex as it needs to find and spend the baton utxo, use the correct datafee and spend funds from the locked subscription funds. With the above, the oracles CC is complete and allows the creations of massively parallel data streams from multiple vendors that uses free market feedback via payments, ie. poorly performing providers wont get renewals.

I expect that at first, the data providers will just be dapp developers deploying a working system including the required data, but its structure allows open market competition. Of course, specific dapps could restrict themselves to using only publishers from a whitelist of pubkeys. The potential usecases for oracles CC is quite varied and limited only by the imagination.

@jl777c I see you replaced chapter 11 channels with oracles 🙂

[06-Sep-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, oracles is much more important

[06-Sep-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, so no channels cc example text?

yes, how can you be expecting the same values for 4 bytes and 8 bytes?

[06-Sep-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that is like expecting the same value for 10000 and 100000000

[06-Sep-18 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
But there is 8 zeros

[06-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand how hex numbers work?

[06-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just use a hex to decimal converter

[06-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it is little endian, maybe that is your confusion?

[06-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
lowest byte is first

[06-Sep-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so 0xffffffff00000000 vs 0xffffffff

[06-Sep-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
one is 0x100000000 times bigger

[06-Sep-18 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes it was a confusion

@jl777c 
```  'd' -> <256 binary data
  'D' -> <65536 binary data

Is length declaration on beginning needed for these types (same as for strings)?

[06-Sep-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Sep-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810

[06-Sep-18 09:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what format would plain text be?

[06-Sep-18 09:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in the oracle format categories

[06-Sep-18 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to convert text to hex first and use 's' or 'S' oracle type with length declaration in first byte/s of data which you sending

I put this table just to show hex numeration not binary

[06-Sep-18 10:23 AM] actionslacks#4072

[06-Sep-18 10:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
or am I not understanding at all wtf this means?

[06-Sep-18 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Not sure if I get your question. Do you mean correlation with real data by "most accurate"? 
There is a subscription model so trustable/reputable oracle can get some revenue

[06-Sep-18 10:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
is it just a popularity contest?

[06-Sep-18 10:28 AM] TonyL#3577
But you just told about accuracy. I think they are interrelated.

[06-Sep-18 10:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It can be a popularity contest. Yes.

[06-Sep-18 10:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It can also be technical data from a corporation

[06-Sep-18 10:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
"in a world, where accuracy and popularity are interrelated..."

[06-Sep-18 10:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
sry I'm just shitposting now

[06-Sep-18 10:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you do some kind of steemit application then popularity is important

[06-Sep-18 10:30 AM] TonyL#3577
If you provide accurate data you're popular as oracle data provider for your niche. Why not?

[06-Sep-18 10:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
No I think i'm getting it. thanks for the explanation

[06-Sep-18 10:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But if for example you are an airport publishing flight schedules. Then its not about popularity but accuracy

[06-Sep-18 10:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
So the most consistently accurate oracle will earn the most fees

[06-Sep-18 10:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
in that case most likely

As medical company I can put data for drugs serial numbers so I can check if it's fake (not matter am I reseller, hospital or consumer), or as hardware manufacturer I can put my devices ID's and so on

[06-Sep-18 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's not a competition cases

[06-Sep-18 10:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
and as a manufacturer you can track serial numbers and cross reference BOM's with suppliers

[06-Sep-18 10:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
quality problem? check the oracle

[06-Sep-18 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, there is a lot of cool cases and scenarios + possible to combine/connect CCs. As I think it's a most natural way of blockchain usage - immutable distributed database to proof important things

[06-Sep-18 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
So oracles cc looks like the key one

[06-Sep-18 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
A lot of space for IOT stuff as well
