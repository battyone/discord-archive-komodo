[04-Oct-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
can anybody other than mihailo describe how it is possible for mempool tx to be dPoW protected

[04-Oct-18 12:06 PM] gcharang#6833
First fund the channels cc address of the recepient. Wait for the tx to  be dPOW protected so it can't be reorged. This funding utxo can only be claimed by the recipient if he can produce a secret.
So when the sender reveals a secret, the recipient can claim the funds that correspond to it. This funding will be valid till the channel close tx hits the mempool

[04-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Mylo#8306
After tx that creates the channel tx goes into dPoW.  The channel tx (split into 1000) can only be spent once.

[04-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Mylo#8306
what @gcharang said 😃

[04-Oct-18 12:11 PM] gcharang#6833
Also the channel close will take effect after the next notarization. So all the funds whose secrets are revealed will be claimable even if there was a reorg attempt

[04-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
close, but not quite

[04-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
each channelpayment is a different tx, and not necessarily in the same block

[04-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
even if any of them are invalidated by a reorg and double spend, the payment is still valid

[04-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
how is it possible for a payment to survive an actual reorg that double spends all the inputs

[04-Oct-18 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
I wondered about having separate state hash for each channel. And this state hash notarising

[04-Oct-18 12:17 PM] gcharang#6833
The recipient node has to be online and take notice of the `secret` so that he can send the transaction?

[04-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes!

[04-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
once the secret is revealed, that allows collection of payment. no need for the sender tx

[04-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so even if the payment is reorged and invalidated, the receiver just issues another spend using the secret

[04-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
now if the recevier is not online, he would miss the chance to do this, but in this case the assumption is the the value transfer hasnt been done

[04-Oct-18 12:20 PM] gcharang#6833
Yes. If the receiver is providing value online, he will have the ability to monitor the mempool

[04-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so both nodes dont need to be online for this to work and all the tx are normal tx compatible with wallets and explorers, etc.

[04-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Mylo#8306
what is the format of this `secret`?
is this a correct statement:   so the sender has "pre-spent" the funds into the channel.   The channel is always available (until channel is closed) for recipient to reveal secret for that tx in the channel.

[04-Oct-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the sender can close the channel and reclaim funds

[04-Oct-18 12:31 PM] gcharang#6833
The channel is nothing but a output created by the sender. it will have the following constraints:
1) It will only be ever spendable either by the receiver or sender
2) receiver can only spend it by revealing a secret only the sender knows (so making a payment means, the sender is reveling a secret)

[04-Oct-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but the sender cant reclaim the funds until after the close channel is notarized

[04-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so the sender has total control by releasing secrets and as soon as it hits the mempool, it is secured by dPoW that the receiver will receive payment

[04-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and all of it is blockchain enforced in a backward compatible way

[04-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why I say channels CC is an improved LN

[04-Oct-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the method for secret revealing is via hashchain, very efficient encoding of hash secrets

[04-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Mylo#8306
and the receiver, in case of re-org, can just re-reveal the secret to receive the funds in the channel tx.  (lots of things to consider)

hashchain - yes i recall reading it now.  clever/efficient 😃

[04-Oct-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810

[04-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
I would describe the channel CC like this:
1) sender "lock" funds in the channel CC address that is spendable by sender or receiver ONLY!
2) then sender make payments to receiver in new transacitons, and in that payment tx also the secret for that amount is now known 
3) if receiver wants to make a payment (this will usually be done only when the payment from sender some how did not reach receiver - for example chain reorg) he must provide the secret. This implies that receiver was online and saw the tx with payment from sender and noted the secret for that payment
4) if sender wants to withdraw fund from channel (he do not want to have channel to receiver anymore), then he first must do a close tx which will just mark that channel will be closed and receiver can see that, and then after close tx is confirmed he can issue refund tx and take the funds.

[04-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
As jl777c mentioned the biggest advantage of channel CC is that it has enabled to secure payments that are in mempool with dPoW. I first did not realised how, but with this explanation it gets a lot clearer:
- when the channel is opened and that open tx is notarised basically it means that the amount locked in channel address is known that it will definitively reach either receiver or back to sender. Now when payments are done, by the time they reach mempool, both sides can see them and the secret which is needed to spend them. So, it is not needed to wait the tx to end up in the chain or to be confirmed, because as soon the receiver has the secret for the payment he knows he will get those funds. In other words, you can say that when a payment is done it is immediately confirmed.

[04-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
In the case that sender closes the channel, he still must wait for notarisation to happen before he can withdraw funds. So the receiver will see that channel will be closed and no more funds will get to him.

[04-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it enables small chains to be used for point of sale instant payments

👆 👌 

[04-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and once channels CC can pay assets, it can be KMD or even BTC equivalents being sent on the small chain, all secured by dPoW and valid in seconds

[04-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the combined power of channels, assets, oracles and gateways combined is hard to fully comprehend

[04-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Mylo#8306
And the sender cannot send the payment and close the channel in a quick enough time, because the closing of the channel requires notarization?

[04-Oct-18 01:22 PM] Mihailo#5902
Sender cannot send payment and withdraw funds quickly, as to withdraw it first must be closed and then the close must be notarised which needs more time than the payment to reach receiver.

[04-Oct-18 01:23 PM] Mylo#8306
nice

[04-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
likely some fancy whitepaper and ICO could have been made for the channels CC, we just implemented it in a month instead

😹 

[04-Oct-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
of course we still need to find all the bugs and fix them and add support for tokens

[04-Oct-18 01:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
You must think of channel CC as instant payment where both sides are present because probably there will be some return from receiver in some form (goods, digital stuff ...) . Good example is you are buying coffee in Starbucks, you send the payment to Starbucks and they see it instantly and give you coffee. If you do not send payment they will not give you coffee, if one side (usually the receiver) is not present then you would usually not use channel CC for tx ( but you still can).

[04-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
with LN, I think if you are not online all the time, your funds could be at risk

[04-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Alright#0419

[04-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Alright#0419

Moved Cryptoconditions TUI interface to the new repo to separate from other things: https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui
Current version allowed to do all needed flow at least once (create token, create oracle, create UTXOs, convert token, bind gateway, make KMD deposit transaction, initiate gateways deposit, gateways claim, convert tokens, withdraw).
Only manual oraclefeed running and checking if desired height oraclised is needed (but it's possible to make more comfortable in future).
Step by step guide which can help a lot on this stage: http://pad.supernet.org/cc_gateways_guide not working now by some reason, but I hope it'll be resolved

just make sure your staked komodo is on latest master and it should all work. Alright merged it in a day or 2 ago now.

ok, so I was looking at Tony's examples for s data type he has `05416e746f6e` as an example. Tried it and it works. So the first byte isn't in hex?

I assumed the first byte of that would be `35` as opposed to `05`

also I did `oraclesdata <txid> 05FFFFFFFFFF` and now when I try `oraclessamples` I'm getting

[05-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
`error: couldn't parse reply from server`

first byte is the length

05 is hex
