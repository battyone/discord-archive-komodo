granted it shouldnt crash but the entire codebase is 4 days old, so not time to make it bulletproof yet

[22-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Alright#0419
I did look at the help output. The tokenid is the `name` value from `tokencreate`, yes?

[22-Jul-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
id not name, as in txID

[22-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
Well that explains the seg fault. `tokenbalance` working fine with txid

[23-Jul-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
fixed crash along with too strict error check for most of the rpc calls

[23-Jul-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have errors, what I need is:
a) the specific chain parameters so I can connect to it
b) the EXACT rpc call and parameters you used
c) the most important! the raw tx generated
d) clear description of why you think it is a bug. for now you need to look at the raw tx details to make sure all vins are valid, signed and all vouts are sane.
e) do not post things like "i tried X and it didnt work" as that does not help at all at this stage. These are raw transaction level things and until everything works, things wont work at the higher level.

@cipi I could use your help in validating the fill commands, it is very similar (but different) from the marketmaker order matching issues. For tokens, I actually automatically gather the required utxo for the filling side, so assuming you have the funds, the order will be filled completely.

[23-Jul-18 09:42 AM] jusoaresf#3291
would cc allow for a safe/decentralized (at least as decentralized as NNs) custodian service to hold and release funds without human intervention?

[23-Jul-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
I am making a faucet demo CC contract that allows 1 coin per block to be given out

[23-Jul-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
a savings contract that paid a defined amount of interest is possible as long as the coins needed to pay the interest is funded

[23-Jul-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as holding funds, yes, it will be very good at holding them. however the rules for releasing the funds must be 100% precisely definable via onchain events

[23-Jul-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if that is possible, then it is possible. if anywhere in there is a "and the contract magically reaches consensus on a real world event", then some magic will be needed in addition

[23-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
CC contracts using arbitrary rules on CC utxo is a totally new type of contract. What applies to ETH contracts might or might not apply. So far I have been able to devise a way to implement the contract idea requests being sent, though I notice a lot of reliance on "magic" in many desired contract definitions

[23-Jul-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
one solution to the "magic" would be to have an arbitration address that is controlled by a trusted arbitrator. Then a contract can use signoff from the arbitrator to attest to a specific external event

[23-Jul-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
Another way is to have a specific arbitration utxo for a specific instance of a contract. The spent status of this utxo would then indicate a specific event has happened. So you would setup the arbitration utxos tied to specific events first and then setup the contract that depends on these utxos

[23-Jul-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i know how much people love utxos

[23-Jul-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is even more reason to become familiar with utxo as we have colored utxo, ie. a specific utxo tied to a specific external event

[23-Jul-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain I am assuming my relevant posts are being collected as CC is needing a lot of documentation

[23-Jul-18 10:10 AM] gcharang#6833
I am saving your posts about cc from this channel and other places when I see them. shossain is also doing it I think.

[23-Jul-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, and I am also (unusually for me) actually commenting the source code in ~/komodo/src/cc/*

[23-Jul-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to get it so new devs can onboard quickly to make new CC contracts. I will be making a set of reference contracts. If there is a C++ coder experience in making classes, I would appreciate a bit of help to define the CCcontract class to put all these contracts into. I am not quite clear enough on all the c++ details to feel thatI can do a proper job for this, so I am making it C based for now

[23-Jul-18 10:29 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, we are collecting them. i'll start to organise them today

[23-Jul-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix for fillbuy, now all rpc other than fillsell and swaps have been tested at least once

[23-Jul-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
fillsell now has a non-zero chance of actually being sane and working

[23-Jul-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
I could really use some help in finding bugs, especially with the fill commands...

[23-Jul-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c please send some ASSETS here `RANyPgfZZLhSjQB9jrzztSw66zMMYDZuxQ`

[23-Jul-18 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
actually, now trying to mine with 2 threads

[23-Jul-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using alright's chain: ./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=ASSES -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=0329c28e5d0b5c49f759cfb680b08bf08fd780845b382b077a473a237841db7404 -addnode=195.201.137.5

[23-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
Fairly sure ASSETS is deded, I can send you some ASSES though 😂

[23-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
unstuck it?

[23-Jul-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810

mining quite fast 😛

[23-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
sent you some ASSES, if you sync it, you'll see bids under `tokenorders`, try to buy them

[23-Jul-18 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
Going to resyn ASSETS in a minute, I'm tired of saying ASSES

[23-Jul-18 01:50 PM] jusoaresf#3291
The kind of cc magic I dream of is related to atomic swaps
Like if I send the cc contract an X amount of coin A along with my address of coin B then, after my coin A tx gets enough confirmations, the contract will send Y amount of coin B to that address... not much hocus pocus I hope (?)

[23-Jul-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so instead of limiting things to a single chain, you want to operate on three chains?

[23-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Mylo#8306
and to give you an example of this 3rd chain stuff, i sent libscott this message a week or two ago when prodding for info:
```
Yes. In steps of "can we achieve it with CC"

Address on chain A to automatically accrue funds from chain B
At a block height (divisible by 1000 for example), chain A uses a cc to exchange chain B in their wallet for chain C
The chain C only has a finite amount available for exchange with chain B every 1000 blocks.
For instance, every new KMD address receives PIONEERS. Every 1000 blocks, if the wallet hasn't got any MEETUPS or the PIONEERS address hasn't been used to swap for MEETUPS in the past, some PIONEERS coins are exchanged for MEETUPS.

As a side note, the komodopioneers notary node offers meetup subsidies. So in this example, in order to get a komodopioneers meetup subsidy (up to $300), you need to exchange 100k MEETUPS, by collecting MEETUPS from people. Because MEETUPS are available everywhere, it's a means/incentive for people holding the event to collect MEETUPS from people (at the event or just online or through forum, or computer generated script)
```
and the awesome reply was
```
Yea... lets imagine this is possible <------this!----
The thing is all the transactions need to be triggered manually
```

[23-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Mylo#8306
basically chain A -> get token A -> exchange for token C at certain times in blockchain life (height)

@libscott can you fix the old gcc dependence described above?

[23-Jul-18 03:15 PM] cipi#4502
you can have multiple gcc-versions installed at the same time and switch between them as needed

it was quite interesting

[23-Jul-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem was that the transactions were not in the mempool
