let me know if jl777 branch builds for you

[02-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
do the makerogue before building the komodod

[02-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Players send moves one-by-one inside the X players room. State of closed cards player gets encrypted and can decrypt with privkey, something like this

[02-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, sure

[02-Feb-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
this is also an example of how to have different libcc.so, makecclib makes the sudoku one, makerogue makes the rogue one, they use the same evalcodes

TERMINAL is an ncurses thing, so you dont have struct term defined in the curses.h, something like that

[02-Feb-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Moreover some guy reported about same issue 16 days ago 😃

[02-Feb-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain did you do a makerogue first?

[02-Feb-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is still statically linking komodod, so the right libcc.so needs to be already in ~/komodo/src

[02-Feb-19 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
running `./makerogue` from inside `cc` dir got me this

you can verify this by comparing savefile with checkfile after the replay is done

[02-Feb-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if you ever get it so replay is not matching the initial state, that is a bad bug and I will need the keystroke files, along with the savefile
