I was interested to learn how zmigrate worked, so I played around a bit. I hope the README makes it easier for people to understand how it works, and the Makefile should make it easier as we add many more dApps, which seem to be on the horizen. Just a bit of icing to add to the cake that James has already baked

Hi guys, is there a planned channel for the token CC ?

[18-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Adli#5025
Or are there more informations than the official doc : https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/tokens/rpc-index.html

[18-Dec-18 10:48 AM] Adli#5025
Or is there an existing project that us this CC

@Mihailo  I am seeing a huge slow down of CC transactions on chain sync after the spaling activation block. Any idea on what could cause it?

[19-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, in what whay is the slow down?

[19-Dec-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
apears to hang the daemon

[19-Dec-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like its locked

[19-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
Which CC?

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and pins a CPU core to 100%

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oracles

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least those are the txs on this chain

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
large numbers in a block seems to do it

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
We had some problem with oralces, and it was behaving like this (hanging the daemon) but it was fixed.

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm I am equal with FSM

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
On which version is the client?

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess you need more data

[19-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep

[19-Dec-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... dint want to investingate a known problem

[19-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Mihailo#5902
Can you tell me which chain, and I could connect and try to investigate

[19-Dec-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its on CFEK KMD labs

[19-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, ok.

[19-Dec-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need labs branch to sync chain, because its has import txs on it and requires the correct pubkeys to verify them,

[19-Dec-18 09:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
And what is the exact name of the branch?

[19-Dec-18 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use master branch its equal with FSM apart from changes to allow a diffrent set of notary nodes and some changes to the staking loop that are yet to me merged down.

[19-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, you confused me with 'you need labs branch' üòâ

ahh sorry yeah... labs fork (which is actually called staked üòÇ )

[19-Dec-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just synced CFEK on the latest and it seems to be a bit faster than it was, like it no longer hangs for over a minute on some blocks.

[19-Dec-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still slows down a heap over earlier blocks though.

[19-Dec-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure if there are that amount of oracels txs in any blocks before sapling... tehre are oracles txs, but not that many of them. DragonHound went into an infinate loop spamming oracles txs

[19-Dec-18 10:04 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, so the daemon is not hanging indefinitely, it just slows down... Could it be that spam of oracles txs that is causing this?

[19-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
I've started syncing now, let see...

[19-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
I see the slow down. But can't seem to figure out why. The number of txs is not huge, so I have see where it is spending lot of time when syncing. Probably in blcok/tx validation

[19-Dec-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
in the dependency loop in main.cpp, the code was changed a bit recently.

[19-Dec-18 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I managed to speed it up quite a lot, but its still very slow, maybe its the actual mempool fix, would it be OK, if we add the txs to the mempool without a addtomempool check? If that indeed its this loop causing it?

[19-Dec-18 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because I think its OK to assume that the txs in a confirmed mined block are indeed valid

[19-Dec-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that seems fine

[19-Dec-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its worth a test at least

[20-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt work or speed it up

[20-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üò¶

[20-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mempool ends up full of txs with spent inputs

[20-Dec-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and those blocks took just as long to validate

[20-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think i've identified the issue

[20-Dec-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its when it adds to the mempool...

[20-Dec-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its being done 3-4 times for every block, and each time it happens it takes longer.

[20-Dec-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can make it so that it only checks the transactions when it checks PoW ... but then debug.log floods with:
```2018-12-20 06:13:43 ERROR: myGetTransaction: Deserialize or I/O error - Unknown transaction format: iostream error
2018-12-20 06:13:43 ERROR: myGetTransaction: Deserialize or I/O error - ReadCompactSize(): size too large: iostream error
```

[20-Dec-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it still syncs and its much faster ... but that error spams like crazy

[20-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need some way to flag it inside CheckBlock, so that it only trys to add the txs in once.

[20-Dec-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because once it has done it once, they are all already in the mempool, and it will loop almsot infinatly until they are all rejected.

[20-Dec-18 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
going to try a fresh sync fomr block 0, just incaser something here is corrupted

[20-Dec-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that seemed to work, trying something else now. Using the flag I used to stop it spamming accept to mempool prints, I am trying to skip all the checks for inputs and just force the txs into the mempool out of order. doing this by  just useing addUnchecked didnt work, but skipping only tx validation and doing the rest of the checks it might actually work.

[20-Dec-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks good so far üòÑ

[20-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will need to sync KMDICE next to verify that its still working properly... But its now only doing this mempool thing once per block, and it manages to add everything to the mempool in one loop.

[20-Dec-18 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
some large blocks on CFEK were takign 28 seconds to add to mempool before.

[20-Dec-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now they take 0s

[20-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Definalty stll a slow down here though.

[20-Dec-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Need to somehow disable the receiving of transactions and proagating of mempool until the chain is synced...

[20-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
also the segid fix

[20-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will make PR with all of them at once... I cant seem to work out how to disable propagation of txs while IsInitailBlockDownlaod is true... I managed to stop the mempool receiving txns, because that made it slow down a lot, receiving txs before sapling was active on local node. But syncing KMDICE I have 45mbit upload bandwidth maxed out the whole time. and the nodes I am downlaoding off will be flat out rejecting all that data.

[20-Dec-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
propagation is somewhere in the message processing, i think end of main.cpp

[20-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found where it does it

[20-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but my code didnt do anything

[20-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if (inv.type == MSG_TX && IsInitialBlockDownload()) // dont send txs when syncing, it floods other nodes.
                {
                    fprintf(stderr, "skipped sending tx.\n");
                    continue;
                }```

[20-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt work

[20-Dec-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
there would be other places that do the trickling out, look for outbound messages

[20-Dec-18 11:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this one is very tricky... fast running out of ideas. tried about 10 palces so far to stop it sending.. without any luck. Might be best to try and make it print the data its sending somewher in net.cpp and then working abck from that. I have holidays from tomorrow so If i cant figure this out tonigh I will make PR with the rest before I leave.

[20-Dec-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is a good plan.

[20-Dec-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe do it sooner than later as the mempools transmission will definitely take a long time to track down

Hello,
As we all know CC are opening  up a lot of possibilities, so does a stable coin on Komodo.
If you are developing a market place, a P2P transaction system or platform that require some kind of price stability, we will be happy to chat with you
We are aiming to develop as much use cases as possible for KSB

It appears to be .. I know 100% sure that it checks everything at least once.

it adds all the txs to the mempool on block receive, but assumes the inputs are fine. A confirmed block has already checked all that.

it is about 100x faster, so maybe its not safe but I am quite sure that its, checking things 2-3 times doesnt seem to make a lot of sense, if it passes the first time it will pass the second time.
