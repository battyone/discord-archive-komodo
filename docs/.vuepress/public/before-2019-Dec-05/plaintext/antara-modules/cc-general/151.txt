Here notaries are used to execute a will, so could be an option to have them validate the death?

[22-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah heir cc already exists?

[22-Jan-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[22-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Nevermind then üôà

[22-Jan-19 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
How does it work, where can I read up?

[22-Jan-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if after a specified amount of time you make no spends, your heir can spend. works with tokens too, so can be tokenized BTC, KMD, ...

[22-Jan-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
#cc-heir

[22-Jan-19 09:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, so the cc assumes you are dead if you dont make a tx?

[22-Jan-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
you make a "will" by creating a specific heir CC address (your pubkey + heir pubkey). and the time required to consider yourself gone

[22-Jan-19 09:17 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"In tonight's news man finally released after being held captive for 2 years, His heir cc finally kicked and he was released unshaved"

[22-Jan-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
be careful who you choose as an heir!

[22-Jan-19 09:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Just realised that it would be good to choose multiply heirs as priority list

[22-Jan-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
If first priority heir not claim after some time - second can claim and so on

[22-Jan-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
you can split the funds to multiple heirs with multiple addresses

[22-Jan-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
In case if I want share funds yes

[22-Jan-19 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
In usual jurisprudence persists kinda "circles of heirs" - if heirs from first circle not claim after X time - heirs from second circle can claim and so on. If nobody claim money go to the government

[22-Jan-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
only one level is supported. maybe the creator can make the heir keypair and disclose the privkey to the circle of heirs via offchain methods

[22-Jan-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Still a fan of using an oracle, that way funds are released faster when dead :p

[22-Jan-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, current state will definitely do for now

[22-Jan-19 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe some day if VRSC is used as a way to verify identity in some countries üòÉ

Is heir-cc able to also spend accuired APR when doing it with komodo?

[30-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
@blackjok3r I have the same problem with miner blocking even on new chain when it mines the gatewaysclaim tx. Not sure what can be wrong as I think I did'nt change anything regarding that tx... Only thing I did is to rebase to latest FSM...

[30-Jan-19 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm not sure what's in that tbh... Can u try with labs komodo build and tell me if its the same?

[30-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think labs do not have latest gateways changes...

[30-Jan-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its equal with FSM from a few days back just merge it to your own fork? Or do u need me to do that?

[30-Jan-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume your using 100% pow chain?

[30-Jan-19 01:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[30-Jan-19 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Changes I made to miner should only effect pos chains if not its a bug

[30-Jan-19 01:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think this is not a problem with miner, but with ConnectBlock which is verifing tx....

[30-Jan-19 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am quite good at catching bugs if I can reproduce it...

[30-Jan-19 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hmmm... Connect block calls a csmain lock 2 times but they are in diff {}

[30-Jan-19 01:31 PM] Mihailo#5902
This is reproducable 100%

[30-Jan-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
In testing I had to make it lock both under sustained tx spam...

[30-Jan-19 01:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If it can be exactly reproduced DM me steps heading home soon

[30-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Mihailo#5902
The setup is little bit difficult as you have to go through gateway setup. Multisig nodes setup, oraclefeed, waiting for deposit feed in oracles and then deposit and claim.

[30-Jan-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u want me to help I'm going to need them

[30-Jan-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do it... Maybe not to tonight... But I can make a start

[30-Jan-19 01:36 PM] Mihailo#5902
Maybe I should check also  with 1of1 gateway, maybe it is not a problem there

[30-Jan-19 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can't deny I've created some terrible bugs lately...  But if I did I will fix them

[30-Jan-19 01:37 PM] Mihailo#5902
I can assist you in setup of gateways, just dm me when you are ready

[30-Jan-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Np

[30-Jan-19 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do u never sleep?

[30-Jan-19 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that old round earth making timezones ay

[30-Jan-19 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm +8.. GMT whatever that is

[30-Jan-19 03:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
Same with single gateway...

[30-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, I have a lead. If I turn off validation then it works....

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
validation is using code that locks

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
Probably some mistake there as latest I turned on CC validation for gateways

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
Haaaa

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
validation code is deep within locks

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
no need to lock again

[30-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
Probably it is somewhere GetTransaction instead of myGetTransaction

[30-Jan-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that would do it

[30-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Mihailo#5902
@blackjok3r You can sleep with peace. It is not your bug üòõ üòÑ

[30-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, I used functions from Gatewaysbind RPC to check bind in validation, and this function uses GetTransaction...

[30-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
CCfullsupply()

[30-Jan-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the rpc functions call use the non-locking versions

[30-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes I know. But these are from CCtx.cpp

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
```cpp
int64_t CCfullsupply(uint256 tokenid)
{
    uint256 hashBlock; int32_t numvouts; CTransaction tx; std::vector<uint8_t> origpubkey; std::string name,description;
    if ( GetTransaction(tokenid,tx,hashBlock,false) != 0 && (numvouts= tx.vout.size()) > 0 )
    {
        if (DecodeTokenCreateOpRet(tx.vout[numvouts-1].scriptPubKey,origpubkey,name,description))
        {
            return(tx.vout[0].nValue);
        }
    }
    return(0);
}

int64_t CCtoken_balance(char *coinaddr,uint256 reftokenid)
{
    int64_t price,sum = 0; int32_t numvouts; CTransaction tx; uint256 tokenid,txid,hashBlock; 
    std::vector<uint8_t>  vopretExtra;
    std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue> > unspentOutputs;
    uint8_t evalCode;

    SetCCunspents(unspentOutputs,coinaddr);
    for (std::vector<std::pair<CAddressUnspentKey, CAddressUnspentValue> >::const_iterator it=unspentOutputs.begin(); it!=unspentOutputs.end(); it++)
    {
        txid = it->first.txhash;
        if ( GetTransaction(txid,tx,hashBlock,false) != 0 && (numvouts=tx.vout.size()) > 0 )
        {
            char str[65];
            std::vector<CPubKey> voutTokenPubkeys;
            if ( reftokenid==txid || (DecodeTokenOpRet(tx.vout[numvouts-1].scriptPubKey, evalCode, tokenid, voutTokenPubkeys, vopretExtra) != 0 && reftokenid == tokenid))
            {
                sum += it->second.satoshis;
            }
        }
    }
    return(sum);
}```

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
I suppose I can switch them to myGetTransaction

[30-Jan-19 03:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
As they can be used in validation also...

[30-Jan-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[30-Jan-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
good plan

[30-Jan-19 06:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Wow, I just realised something, but I'm having 1 problem of certainty. A company my company works with uses a system called LPS for supply chain management of car parts and to make sure each part individually goes through all the processes by making a log of when it goes from station to station with an attatched anotator  of whether the part passed or failed the previous process based on parameter window limits. A blockchain is literally keymade for this type of part of tracking but would decentralized nodes holding the database fair better than a Centralized super computer server managing this kind of push/pull query. Honestly on second thought it definitely has to be better, because of the local data holding over a Centralized server having to do pushes and pulls whereas a blockchain only has pushes.

hey guys, just posted in Pirates, but it's about a CC lottery - not sure if somebody already started that but if the Pirates lottery goes fine it might be that a decentralized lottery is also a cool idea attradcting people to the ecosystem. Maybe making this cc-lotttery needs a new ico as to have money for dev + ads + first few lotteries iterations. ICO investors could get a % revenue from lottery tickets. Another possibility is that anyone could run a lottery setting some pars like (time start, time to end, funding initial amount, % revenue for initializer, % revenue for special cause)... Thoughts ? If I new how to code blockchains (and deal with legal things regarding this) I would do it :pirate:

[02-Feb-19 02:33 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Another idea - cc-schedule-tx - be able to create one time scheduled tx (conditioned tx, parameters: this addr  activity [for example addr not active for 3 months - do send], datetime - after which is is valid, amount to send (or % of holdings), addr or addr list with possibility to check addr activity - not to send to a long dead addr [no withdrawal from addr for longer then N months] - send to first active addr on the list or the most recent active addr on the list OR other addr that have set this CC rules so that the amount will be eventually passed to someone) AND option 2 iterative tx  also where iterations based on amount of time or specific days of week, month like every first Monday of the month ... like in online banking schedule...

[02-Feb-19 02:34 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
cc-schedule is maybe kind of generalization of cc-heritage I read somewhere going to be developed

[02-Feb-19 04:01 PM] Lumbi#8378
Trustless, Reliable, Redundant (TRR) : these are the three essential CC design challenges.

i figured out how to gamify any deterministic solitaire game

[02-Feb-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
1. creategame with buyin, then for 5 blocks anybody can register with buyin

[02-Feb-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
2. then progress tx are submitted

[02-Feb-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
3. the first to complete, wins all the buyins

[02-Feb-19 07:03 PM] TonyL#3577
And play some card games between participants via CC, no?

[02-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, it is just open to whoever registers
