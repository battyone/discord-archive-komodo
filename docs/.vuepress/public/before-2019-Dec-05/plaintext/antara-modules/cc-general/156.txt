`&` and `-daemon` does the same job

[13-Feb-19 03:32 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Got the faucet working, OMG, this is just incredible.

[13-Feb-19 03:32 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
But the addresses and keys are hardcoded right?

[13-Feb-19 03:35 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
so the myCCAddress is built from the pubKey that I published right?

[13-Feb-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, your CC address generating for your `-pubkey`.
This `pubkey` param is like a ID or passport in the CC world.

Here you can find conceptual description of faucetCC:
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/all_chapters.md#chapter-6---faucet-example
And RPC calls examples are in this file on faucet page:

[13-Feb-19 03:39 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So when doing `faucetfund` it will get the funds from the CC address?

[13-Feb-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
If you doing faucetfund it will get the funds from your wallet

[13-Feb-19 03:40 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, meaning the UTXOs right?

[13-Feb-19 03:42 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
so everytime i do a rpc call, does it make a transaction? or only just those involving funds? Like
`faucetfund` creates a tx but `faucetaddress` doesn't

[13-Feb-19 03:42 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I asked this because in Some other Smart Contract blockchain, every process needs gas . 😄

[13-Feb-19 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
`faucetaddress` is a debug call which only scanning but not generating any transaction
`faucetfund` - call which generating raw transaction with needed params to fund faucet

[13-Feb-19 03:46 PM] TonyL#3577
You can easily check in details inputs and outputs of generated transaction 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain faucetfund 1
{
  "result": "success",
  "hex": "hexhere"
}
```
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain decoderawtransaction <hexgeneratedbyfaucetfund>```

[13-Feb-19 03:47 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
okay got it on the link you sent

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
this really nice

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
what an innovation

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
To broadcast transaction on blockchain use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain sendrawtransaction hex` and you'll get transaction id

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
then the transaction would have the Crypto condition type right?

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
You can create really incredible things by determining rules for special UTXOs

[13-Feb-19 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577

Some vouts are `cryptoconditon` type. There is `eval` codes also to determine to which CC it's related. I advice you to read whole `Mastering cryptoconditons` book if you want to wrap head

[13-Feb-19 03:51 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I will @TonyL atleast right now I have a head start to show this demo on the presentation

[13-Feb-19 03:51 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Are there any testnet coins I can use to like demo all the faucet calls?

[13-Feb-19 03:52 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC faucetfund 1
{
  "result": "error",

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I guess it needs atleast 1 KMD

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
haha

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
1 TXSCLCC not KMD 😃

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
To check balance use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC getbalance`

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
You may try to mine some coins by mining enabling:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true`

[13-Feb-19 03:54 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
okay, will have some funds overnight maybe?

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
or maybe someone can send to me?

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
😃

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
I think someone can send it to you, maybe @SHossain have TXSCLCC

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your address?

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904

Thanks will the server for this asset still be available on Monday, I might have my initial presentation and demo

[13-Feb-19 04:03 PM] SHossain#0007
what do you mean? your server or TXSCLCC seed nodes?

[13-Feb-19 04:04 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
the TXSCLCC seed nodes.

[13-Feb-19 04:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, hex is randomly (almost because CC script generating it) generated - don't have information readable by human unless you decode it. Eval codes are defined in `komodo/src/cc/eval.h`

[13-Feb-19 04:09 PM] SHossain#0007
the TXSCLCC chain is online for couple of months now and will be there
they are also being notarized

[13-Feb-19 04:10 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Ok Thanks @SHossain

[13-Feb-19 04:10 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@TonyL So you can't really know what the CC being run just by looking into the tx output right?

[13-Feb-19 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
You can't know it by looking on hex, correct

[13-Feb-19 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Easy example

[13-Feb-19 04:13 PM] TonyL#3577
I've pre-generated transaction by `faucetfund 1`
And decode it
One of the vouts is cryptoconditions type with 1 coin amount:
```  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 1.00000000,
      "valueZat": 100000000,

        "hex": "2ea22c8020e029c511da55523565835887e412e5a0c9b920801b007000df45e545f25028248103120c008203000401cc",

[13-Feb-19 04:14 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yes

[13-Feb-19 04:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Checking faucetaddress:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE faucetaddress

[13-Feb-19 04:14 PM] TonyL#3577
`"FaucetCCAddress": "R9zHrofhRbub7ER77B7NrVch3A63R39GuC"`

[13-Feb-19 04:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Match with address in cryptoconditions vout of 1 coin 😃

[13-Feb-19 04:15 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Ok that's the only time we know that yes this a faucet CC.

[13-Feb-19 04:15 PM] TonyL#3577
There are some RPC calls to automatically check to which CC transaction is related but I not remember it since it's using CC devs for debug mostly

[13-Feb-19 04:15 PM] TonyL#3577
But manually way of detection is like this in my understanding

[13-Feb-19 04:16 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I think it might be worth adding the eval codes somewhere in the tx I think. since just merely looking into the tx with the eval code makes it easy to know which CC was ran.

[13-Feb-19 04:16 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
But this is just my opinion.

[13-Feb-19 04:17 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
😃

[13-Feb-19 04:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Stare on hexes and txids not not the most exciting thing to do it's better if computer doing this job 😃

[13-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
@josephnicholas GMT+8 https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/cc/eval.h 

If you look at the hex tony showed you, it will have a corresponding EVAL code for the cryptocondition in it. If you look at the OP_RETURN hex, it will show you what kind of transaction it is for the EVAL code

Yeah, I am currently on `master` branch, but its quite good to know that there is that RPC call present though.

[14-Feb-19 02:41 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@jl777c So when we say that CC smart contracts are linked on a specific address and funds are locked only in the contract, how does it differentiate with balanced based smart contracts, contracts are also separated on different address right?

[14-Feb-19 02:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So we fund every contract to activate it?

[14-Feb-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is utxo based

[14-Feb-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
depending on what specifically you mean by activate....

[14-Feb-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
in some sense the CC are already active, just waiting for funds. but I can see how being dormant is not active.

[14-Feb-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just because two totally different things have one thing in common, it doesnt really make them the same

[14-Feb-19 06:13 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @jl777c

[14-Feb-19 09:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 master branch is rarely updated, `beta` or `dev` is probably more what you want

[14-Feb-19 09:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
and for cryptocontracts, many things will only be in `FSM` as alright said

[14-Feb-19 09:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
the branches go like this: jl777 > FSM > dev > beta > master, where the latest code goes in at the left and travels to the right. I am sure somebody will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that is the general structure (there are more branches, but those are the main long-running integration points of various topic branches/PRs/etc)

I just read this...

[18-Feb-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
> 2. UTXOs are stateless, and so are not well-suited to applications more complex than asset issuance and transfer that are generally stateful, such as various kinds of smart contracts.

`stateless` is what I need to get my head clear on

[18-Feb-19 03:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, cleared... I think....

[18-Feb-19 03:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what would be the answer to these two points from this article?
1. UTXOs are unnecessarily complicated, and the complexity gets even greater in the implementation than in the theory.
2. UTXOs are stateless, and so are not well-suited to applications more complex than asset issuance and transfer that are generally stateful, such as various kinds of smart contracts.

[18-Feb-19 03:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand the point 1, UTXOs are not as easy to manage. But they provide greater security over Balance based model of blockchain

[18-Feb-19 03:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for second point, How does CC solves this statefulness?

[18-Feb-19 03:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
need to re-read mastering cryptoconditions....

[18-Feb-19 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think CC just adds a possible state to a utxo... Probably over simplified but thats what they appear to do to me.

[18-Feb-19 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain has the state information, ie. the utxo an address has, whether a utxo is unspent

[18-Feb-19 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
I have almost directly mapped the CC logic to what the blockchain does directly, using linked lists, via baton utxo. the baton provides the mutual exclusiveness, guarantee of single usage, it also allows to reconstruct history by traversing the vins

[18-Feb-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
with a balance based system, how can you be sure it isnt being double spent? sure it is possible to construct a complex system to achieve this, but attack vectors can target the entire balance and it makes the core needlessly more complex. yes, utxo are more of a pain to be dealing with than a balance based, but if that is what it takes to make things fast, secure and scalable, it is a price worth paying

[18-Feb-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also, if utxo based things are so hard, then how am I able to write them so fast?
