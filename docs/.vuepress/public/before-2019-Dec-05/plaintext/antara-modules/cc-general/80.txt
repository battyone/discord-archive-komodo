[23-Aug-18 09:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think the test suite uses combinations of CLI arguments that nobody has ever used

[23-Aug-18 09:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it confuses some parts of the code. Stuff seems to work, so i just ignore that warning. that code doesn't understand that sometimes the filename is an absolute filename ( starting with / ) from the CLI, not a relative filename. Something like that

[23-Aug-18 09:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you have a nice fix, go for it. For the other warning, i just turned it off in regtest mode, maybe the same should be done

any command line program to get these contracts running more smoothly?

at least auto propagation of rawtx?

[23-Aug-18 10:03 PM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers As one of solutions to simplify live a lil bit: you can make an aliases like a 
```alias raw="komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK sendrawtransaction"```

i guess that is a python function, right?

[23-Aug-18 10:05 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a Linux alias - you assign some execution to some text call

[23-Aug-18 10:05 PM] TonyL#3577
So when you next time will call `raw` will be executed `komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK sendrawtransaction`

[24-Aug-18 05:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c right now, only the first 8 chars of a plan name are used, the rest is ignored. So if a user/developer writes code for SOMEPLAN, SOMEPLAN1 and SOMEPLAN2,  all that code silently uses SOMEPLAN, which I imagine would be surprising and hard-to-debug to a newcomer. How do you feel about me adding error checking code, and returning an error immediately if plan names exceed 8 chars?

[24-Aug-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, good idea to limit plan len to 8

{Reactions}
üëçüèΩ 

[24-Aug-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the txid is also used so the plan name is sort of a redundant shorthand but best to prevent this confusion

[24-Aug-18 09:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@TonyL that looks like what i would like to have

[24-Aug-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright the behavior of the dice rpc calls are a bit different depending on if it is from the dealer or player

[24-Aug-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if you understand the entropy sources, it will make more sense. the dicebet includes the actual entropy value, so all know what it is. the diceentropy tx only the dealer knows. So only the dealer can do an instant dicefinish that completes the dicebet with win/loss

[24-Aug-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
non-dealers can do a timeout claim, only after it is timed out

[24-Aug-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
dicestatus without bettxid, invokes a special loop to dicefinish all that can be for the dealer

@dukeleto Hi! My PR (I made one more commit today with Token CC tests) was merged to dev. Waiting for yours faucet fix ^^
Did you start with bet CC? I want to proceed to this one and afraid of conflicts? I'm thinking also about adding second node to test moments when you trying to cancel other people node, for cases when one pubkey create SC and second pubkey place bets and etc. Could you please advice what is the best way to implement it?

[24-Aug-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why not have bettestsT and bettestsD or some naming like that to keep things separated?

[24-Aug-18 03:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, sounds like a very good idea @jl777c

[24-Aug-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810

@TonyL you change the code and I can review

[24-Aug-18 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
TLDR: use the ERR_RESULT() macro to put an error message into a json result

[24-Aug-18 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if you are in the internals, assign to CCerror, like CCerror = "this messed up"; , to make the error get used in json error results

[24-Aug-18 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
you will see a common pattern in the code
