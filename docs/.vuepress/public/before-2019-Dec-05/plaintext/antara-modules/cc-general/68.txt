Hmm, how can I win 30000 if I placed a 10000 bet with 2 odds (I guess it means 1/2)?
Or is 2 means that I place bet on two numbers of hexahedral dice?

[18-Aug-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you bet 1 unit at 2:1 odds, since you won you win 2 and get back the 1 you put in

[18-Aug-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
1:1 odds is even money bet, you bet 1 and get back 0 or 2

[18-Aug-18 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Got it, thanks @jl777c 
Just thought about classic bookmaker formula: Bet * Odds  = Payout, thats why was a lil bit confused

[18-Aug-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I got it wrong?

[18-Aug-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont use dice games, so someone familar with satoshi dice should let us know if this is wrong

[18-Aug-18 05:41 PM] TonyL#3577
If you're using bookmaker and placing a 1000 bet with 2 odds you're assume to get back 2000 if won

[18-Aug-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
also is the payout percentage correct with the way things are setup? i guess would need to automate making many bets to get a statistical average of results

[18-Aug-18 05:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yeah some monte-carlo tests would be great to proof RNG

[18-Aug-18 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me play a little with different bets to determine whether the current payout model is correct. I was a poker-pro in past so perceive all things critically when I see the word "bet" üòÇ

[18-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so things are working like they should?

[18-Aug-18 07:26 PM] TonyL#3577
It's quite problematic to test bets with higher odds since less probability to win. Started to write bet-placing script

[18-Aug-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
probably best to start with 1:1 then 2:1, then 3:1 and we can see if it is changing as it should

[18-Aug-18 09:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, I can't make a new `dicebet` before finish previous game by `dicefinish` (I think would be good to note it somewhere)
Have to re-write my stuff in such case. Before I wanted just to collect  all sendrawtransaction outputs from dicebet for X bets to array and initiate dicefinish for all these bets after.

[18-Aug-18 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
create a new dice plan

[18-Aug-18 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
then use `diceaddfunds` using 10, 20 , 50. 70, 25 1000, ... to be used as entropy tx

[18-Aug-18 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't have much utxos in there

[18-Aug-18 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be more entropy tx. one per block per entropy tx

[18-Aug-18 09:17 PM] TonyL#3577
So, for let's say 1000 test bets have I make 1000 UTXO first?

[18-Aug-18 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
when you create a plan, you add funds already in there (starting funds)

[18-Aug-18 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
use more for that, just for the testing

[18-Aug-18 09:18 PM] SHossain#0007
then, add utxos, about 20-30 is a good idea to have

[18-Aug-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want to do 1000 bets in a single block, yes

[18-Aug-18 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
100 utxo can do 1000 bets in 10 blocks

1 bet per utxo per block

[18-Aug-18 09:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll create a new dice plan and fund with a lot of utxos in 30 minutes from my Linux

[18-Aug-18 09:27 PM] SHossain#0007
for me without automation, it is bit hard to do these in Windows.

[18-Aug-18 09:28 PM] SHossain#0007
Insomnia is best solution for me

[18-Aug-18 09:28 PM] SHossain#0007
it's faster to test the calls

[18-Aug-18 09:32 PM] TonyL#3577
I've made a dice plan TONY and filled by 10 transactions. Gonna stress-test it now

[18-Aug-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if the dice plan node doesnt respond immediately to a dicebet, then a dicestatus call is needed to complete the bet. if it isnt before the timeout blocks happen, the diceplan loses! so best to run a dicestatus call every so often

[18-Aug-18 09:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, can't send more than two `dicebet -> sendrawtransaction` per block. Starting to receive `couldnt create faucet get transaction`

[18-Aug-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to do more than 2 per block, but maybe the utxo selection is getting conflicts.

[18-Aug-18 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
This execution sent 8. Have to set some timeout maybe

[18-Aug-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe try different bet sizes

[18-Aug-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
matched to different sized utxo

[18-Aug-18 09:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Looks fair for now with odds 2
