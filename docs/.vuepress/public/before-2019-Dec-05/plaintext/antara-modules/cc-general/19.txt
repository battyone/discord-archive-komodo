here is the report for eveyrthing i did and what order i tried to fill

[26-Jul-18 08:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
pastebin is because the hex got too big to be pasted here

[26-Jul-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
any bugs other than swap?

[26-Jul-18 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i was able to fill all other orders trying different variations of over supply or lower supply

[26-Jul-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so all the amounts in the tx were ok?

[26-Jul-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
your balances are exactly as expected

[26-Jul-18 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

deleted chain and resynced, but that bug keeps happening from time to time, can't figure out why

[27-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Alright#0419
`tokenbid` and `tokenbidfill` are messed up in that it gives the node that did `tokenbid` both the native coins and tokens

[27-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
Maybe I'm misunderstanding this? I thought I was crazy at first when I was looking at these numbers. Have to look at the vins/vouts of each tx

[27-Jul-18 06:18 AM] Alright#0419
Ok, definitely something weird with this. On one node I did 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATEST tokenbid 10 43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add 1
```
Balances for that node previous to placing the bid:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATEST tokenbalance 43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add

  "balance": 105
}

./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATEST getbalance
239089642.15739731
```

On the other node I filled that bid
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ATEST tokenfillbid 43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add c5025232d5415b4bf943a31fa57eafe940fe554d7139c774df1d0e09f07abd10 10

[27-Jul-18 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
The node doing `tokenfillbid` paid 10 ATEST and 10 tokens to the node that did `tokenbid`, yes?

[27-Jul-18 06:19 AM] Alright#0419
Am I seeing that correctly?

[27-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
So to put it simply, the node that placed the bid, gained 10 tokens and paid no ATEST. The node that filled the bid paid 10 tokens and gained 10 ATEST.

the bidfill does not pay RNv5 at all

[27-Jul-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
are you 100% sure there were no other transactions that confirmed that ended up paying 10 ATEST to RNv

I'll reproduce it again

[27-Jul-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
I was having trouble figuring out where that 10 ATEST came from

[27-Jul-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
please make a list of the vouts for the bid and bidfill, I can do it if you dont know what I mean

[27-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
the bid vouts matched the assets.cpp doc

[27-Jul-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and the fill?

[27-Jul-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and it didnt bonus the bidder with his coins back?

[27-Jul-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I am thinking it could be possible that assets are satoshis that they could be bonused back and absorbed with a lower txfee

[27-Jul-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and the way the validation code works, if you are giving a better deal than what was asked for, it wouldnt complain

[27-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
I'm doing it again right now. I'll have a better understanding if I do this again

[27-Jul-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[27-Jul-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
since the bidfill isnt paying normal coins to node0, this seems a false report

[27-Jul-18 09:30 AM] Alright#0419
ok, again the node that places the bid receives tokens without paying for them. The node that fills the bid receives coins from somewhere other than the node placing the bid. Looking at the inputs of the fillbid

trying to figure out where these coins come from

[27-Jul-18 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
the outputs of fillbid look correct

[27-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Alright#0419
I'm going to spend a bit of time setting up an explorer for this chain. Trying to decode each vin/vout has me going in circles right now

[27-Jul-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you must have vins in a different address that is funding the original bid

[27-Jul-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand vin and vout, rawtransactions.

[27-Jul-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
did you check the balance of node0 AFTER the bid confirmed? my guess is that its ATEST didnt change

[27-Jul-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
my theory explains all the data points you posted about this just need to check the vin and where it came from

[27-Jul-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
ie. get the rawtransaction for the vin and see what address had the funds

[27-Jul-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
...

[27-Jul-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but something is still wrong, if you used the getbalance rpc call, that should account for all ATEST in the wallet

[27-Jul-18 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so definitely something strange here. plz make a tally of all vins/vouts for both the bid and fill, including change

[27-Jul-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
coins dont just disappear, other than txfee that went to the miner

[27-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
I know this sounds nuts, but it seems like coins are appearing from somewhere other than my wallet. I'm using Decker's script to set up an insight explorer right now. Will definitely help if insight will work at least some what properly with the cryptocondition vouts

[27-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not losing coins. I'm gaining them from I don't know where

[27-Jul-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
plz check the vins and vouts

[27-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
Each time I start to look at the raw txs, and trace back the vins I just keep confusing myself

[27-Jul-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know about getrawtransaction txid 1
