@gcharang Wow, that's great work! üî• üôå  @Mihailo pointed me on step which I've missed in my guide and without this step seems not possible to withdraw funds from gateway. I've re-check the whole flow tomorrow and note this step and maybe some other (will prepare notes/comments based on your doc already).

i just remembered that Decker uses pubkey only to display NN or pool name in insight explorer. that eventually shows the address

[19-Oct-18 07:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a function in iguana and komodo that does it .. ive used it somewhere before

[19-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
@gcharang simplest way I've found is set `-pubkey=` on a daemon then mine a block

[19-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Alright#0419

Hi @Mihailo ! I'm not able to make withdraw now from gateway even in simplest case with M N 1 1 (this time I've imported gateway deposit address privkey on KMD chain) - I guess maybe previous withdraws on this AC broke it since now in `gatewayspending` messed withdrawals for all gateways. 
And behaviour of `gatewayswithdraw` quite strange:
I had a token `"balance": 10000000` and converted it totally with 241 eval and my pubkey.
Then on broadcasting of ```komodo-cli -ac_name=CCNG gatewayswithdraw 3903e595b752d8a8b6afc1f940960d544d19a44358773bba9b1e54ae70f9d974 KMD 0271bc6b553f5f763ca7f64457710f8a0b3f5273b2941edc5091ca41cec39b7328 10000000```
I'm getting ```komodo-cli -ac_name=CCNG sendrawtransaction 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

@TonyL Try with fresh setup, who knows what happened with all the withdrawals. But we should take a look at that.

[20-Oct-18 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder problem was because I wasn't gentle and input 100000 instead of 1 as withdrawal amount

I broke my gateway with this withdrawal I see now. `gatewayswithdrawal` supposed measuring in gatewaysCC paradigm since tokens converted to 241

[20-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
In withdraw goes the amount of KMD you are withdrawing...

[20-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Mihailo#5902
So if you had 100000 tokens thats 0.001 KMD I think

[20-Oct-18 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I had `10000000` for 0.1 KMD deposit

[20-Oct-18 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577

[21-Oct-18 04:48 PM] TonyL#3577
@gcharang Important step which I've missed in gateways doc (I guess it's better to add in orange block to 6.3 GatewaysWithdraw):
Before executing gateways withdrawal import private key for gateways deposit address  from asset chain on which you operating gateway to KMD chain on the same node as on which `oraclefeed` is running (to make gateway node able to send KMD withdrawal transactions from gateway wallet balance) by:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL gatewaysinfo <bindtxid>` <- get <gateway deposit address> from "deposit" field
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL dumprivkey <gateway deposit address ^^>` -> getting <private key>
`./komodo-cli importprivkey <private key ^^>`
Without this step gateway will not able to send gateway deposit wallet funds on KMD chain.

We could launch CASINO with Dice, Roulette, Videopoker, Blackjack, Slots Seven Hot. Maybe more?

[22-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the dice CC can be morphed to casino CC, with immunity from 51% attack, and support for a specific class of games

[22-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the basic concept is dealer hashes entropy, player picks one of the utxo and attaches his entropy, and that creates a deterministic result

[22-Oct-18 09:48 AM] forkwitch#6080
This is true and maybe better as long as not too much complexity.

[22-Oct-18 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess better to use some dice2 CC which return random number from X to Y - it will be much more easier to build casino dAPPs on it

[22-Oct-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so any game that has a user action that generates random numbers that then represent the user "hand", then by having different evaluators all these types of games can be supported

[22-Oct-18 09:49 AM] forkwitch#6080
Or a RNG CC that is used in all Casino games CCs if things should be plugin like.

[22-Oct-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
a single entropy value selected daily and made into a hash chain, revealed after the fact

[22-Oct-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
vs realtime reveal of entropy values from the mempool

[22-Oct-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
in the former, what happens if the dealer node doesnt reveal the seed?

[22-Oct-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
in the latter, the seed must be revealed to resolve the bet

[22-Oct-18 09:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why we use a dealer node? We could use blockchain for entropy or i miss something? Client get the eval on his node??

[22-Oct-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
for the realtime response

[22-Oct-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
how else to get realtime response?

[22-Oct-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a requirement

[22-Oct-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if past values are used, it isnt a secret

[22-Oct-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if future value is used, it isnt realtime

[22-Oct-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the miner can win all the time

[22-Oct-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
current design doesnt allow the dealer node to cheat, the player selectes the entropy tx to match up with

[22-Oct-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
miner cannot affect outcome

[22-Oct-18 09:56 AM] forkwitch#6080
I want to explain you how i imagine it. Correct me please when its wrong. I run the roulette CC on my node, i bet, and each block is a game round, i get the bet result from block data. Now can this not trigger a local SEC reveal process to spend won bet without having a dealer node? In my brain from a cryptographic view it is possible, complex but possible. 
Now the dice CC works different and it needs the central node to run or you can not play. I am thinking if it is not possible to be playing and winning 'independent and decentralized'.

[22-Oct-18 09:56 AM] forkwitch#6080
Now controlling the pool.forkwitch.com i can cheat if i want. I dont. How much is the bounty to cheat?

[22-Oct-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
how can entropy not be known to the nodes that create the entropy?

[22-Oct-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
even using a shamir secret approach, the last node that reconstructs the value will know the entropy and whoever knows the entropy can cheat

[22-Oct-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
as it is, yes the dealer node needs to be running, but it can be running on multple nodes for redundancy

[22-Oct-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is no way to cheat (other than 51% which I think I have a solution for)

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User what part of "it needs to be realtime" did you not understand clear?

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
2 seconds response is needed

[22-Oct-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the requirement

[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and if the miner is betting, he would be able to grind the blockhash to maximize chance to win

[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
please, this is a complex issue, due to realtime nature. if a non-realtime is acceptable, then it is rather easy to solve and not so interesting to play

[22-Oct-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810

[22-Oct-18 10:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Fast response is needed to be competitivw with other games

[22-Oct-18 10:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Speed is part of the addictive effect

[22-Oct-18 10:03 AM] forkwitch#6080
You need it without waiting or it will not make enough addicted. Adrenaline will not go up as high and in short distsance up down up down up down then when you wait long. Then its gonna be long adrenalin kick if you lose 2 times but waited 10 minutes its game over and casino dead because gambler gets mad.

[22-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime response is a REQUIREMENT as in it is REQUIRED, anything else is a fail

[22-Oct-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
no discussion needed on this point

[22-Oct-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime is a must

[22-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
current design satisfies all requirements other than to be immune from 51%. the next design needs to improve on this and not go backwards

[22-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway I have an idea to solve the 51% attack...

[22-Oct-18 10:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please make it that it doesnt require a hard fork hehe

[22-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but the casino CC would use the same method for a player vs house games to get the entropy. just each game would evaluate the two hashes using a different algo to implement the game specifics

[22-Oct-18 10:07 AM] forkwitch#6080
Changing notary freq is not enough?

[22-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well it is still theoretically possible...

[22-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
granted double spending within 5 blocks will not be easy and that assumes you guess when the notaries miss a notarization

[22-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but if we can prevent it, we should
