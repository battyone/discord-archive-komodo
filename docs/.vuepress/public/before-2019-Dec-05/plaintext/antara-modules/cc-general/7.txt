that was a lot more than 12 hrs ago, I fixed your tx and it confirmed

[24-Jul-18 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so what bugs are actually still there?

i guess the error means i wrote something wrong

going to take a look at the tx, but I'm getting

[24-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
Oh, got it to work with 1000 instead of 100

[24-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Alright#0419
the bid stays in the orderbook with 0'd amounts though

[24-Jul-18 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you filled it

[24-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Alright#0419
is it possible to partially fill bids/asks?

[24-Jul-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is these EVAL_ASSETS invalid messages I need to be able to fix it, along with details of the trade. Once you can get a specific error on a chain, then I need the raw bytes that create the error

[24-Jul-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes partial fills should work

[24-Jul-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so each bug report would be the raw hex bytes that reproduces the bug. once things are setup, I can quickly reproduce it just by  a sendrawtransaction

[24-Jul-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
of course you would need to maybe even setup a new asset to create a different bug as any activity might make the bug go away and if the bug goes away, I cant fix it

[24-Jul-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is mine

[24-Jul-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can you fill it? @Alright

[24-Jul-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and what command you use to fill it?

[24-Jul-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no restriction on who can fill orders, but it is easier if a different address does it so you can tell where the payments are going ti

[24-Jul-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and for now I need PRECISE and ACCURATE bug reports. none of this "it didnt work" type of reports as that does not help

[24-Jul-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
reproduced bugs via raw hex

[24-Jul-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe make a bunch if bug assets, bug1, bug2, bug3, ... and experiment around until you create a new bug

[24-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
I'll give you the raw tx for that failed tokenfillbid in a moment

[24-Jul-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and no point to make variations of the same bug over and over, better to have different types of bugs

[24-Jul-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I will be offline soon and wont have time to troubleshoot, so maybe even make github issue out of each one and put in all the details I need to reproduce and understand the context. if it is a fill problem, how was the bid created, what commands were used, what is the rawhex, what error appears

[24-Jul-18 08:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont want to have to guess

[24-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Alright#0419
ðŸ‘Œ

[24-Jul-18 08:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
understood

[24-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
not able to fill that bid @siu - Chainmakers

[24-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
try another with a whole number for price

[24-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
might be that

[24-Jul-18 08:32 PM] Alright#0419
just filled another one of my own bids though

[24-Jul-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
at first, lets try the easiest cases, which is overfilling or filling exactly

[24-Jul-18 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and making sure you have a single utxo big enough to do so

[24-Jul-18 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
from there, you can make it progressively more complex scenario. theoretically it should find however many utxo needed to fill exactly what you specific.

[24-Jul-18 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
also even if it looks like it works, odds are that it did it wrong, so you need to analyze what actually happened with all the inputs and outputs

[24-Jul-18 08:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, a new one

filltx wasnt for assetid
```

[24-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
checking out the txs, couple minutes

[24-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Alright#0419
that's while trying to create the tokenfillbid tx

[24-Jul-18 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what are you buying the tokens with?

[24-Jul-18 08:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ATEST?

[24-Jul-18 08:39 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[24-Jul-18 08:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm

[24-Jul-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
 that means the request got an error in creating the transaction

[24-Jul-18 08:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i can buy my own token

[24-Jul-18 08:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
cant buy your orders

[24-Jul-18 08:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the same for you

[24-Jul-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that's an interesting bug!

[24-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
I'm doing it from separate nodes

[24-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
although I did do tokentransfer between them

[24-Jul-18 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
assets just after being created are in a different state, like coinbase

[24-Jul-18 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be not all cases properly handle it

[24-Jul-18 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be that it needs to be transferred before it can be traded

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
also faucet contract is ready to test

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
faucet works as intended from what I can tell

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be much easier to validate or find bugs

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
gives you the block reward each time you do faucetget?

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Alright#0419
is that correct?

[24-Jul-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
gives you 1 coin

[24-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
Ok, let me look again

[24-Jul-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
can you do a bunch of faucet gets in the same block?

[24-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
it gives the same raw tx

[24-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
so no?

[24-Jul-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and it has code (untested) to prevent using mempool utxo as vin

[24-Jul-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there is 1 big utxo in the faucet fund, 1 faucetget per block

[24-Jul-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
unless bugs

[24-Jul-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
and any stability or locking up issues?

[24-Jul-18 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
those were nasty bugs

[24-Jul-18 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be just the bidfill and asks are the current bugs. try to break down the bidfill into the different scenarios and test each one

[24-Jul-18 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
no lock ups or crashes

[24-Jul-18 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
good. it was a definite bug with a definite fix, but concerned there could be other cases. I dont think any other bitcoin protocol blockchain has contracts code with full access to prior blockchain data

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the miner lockup was due to it doing a validateblock!

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
Just had a node crash :/

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
which was under a lock

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
Had something to do with setgenerate true I believe

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
let me try to replicate

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and the validation invoked the CC code, which deadlocked waiting for the lock to be released

[24-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Alright#0419

[24-Jul-18 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, if it is consistent that is great

[24-Jul-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i will have to remote into it, so DM me the login and I can trouble shoot it later

[24-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419

[24-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
