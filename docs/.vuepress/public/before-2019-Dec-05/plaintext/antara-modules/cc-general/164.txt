Would it be possibl√∂e to implement the issuance of options https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance) in CC?
I mean something like this:

1. issuer creates 2 new coins, BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012
2. issuer sells this coins on AtomicDEX
3. when a put (BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012) is bought, issuer must deposit USDC into a contract address
4. when a call (BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012) is bought, issuer must deposit BTC into a contract address
5. on expiry date (30.12.) the holders of BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 or BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 are paid out automatically from the contract address
   - all the BTCs are sold for USDC
   - the difference between strike price (8000) and real price in USDC is paid out to either the holders of BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 or BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012

BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 can be traded all the time, but 3. and 4. must only be done once (on first transfer from issuer to buyer), so maybe it is easier to do 1., 3. and 4. in one step, so that BTCUSD_CALL_8000_3012 and BTCUSD_PUT_8000_3012 coins are only created when the USDC/BTC deposits have been done.

[27-Sep-19 06:52 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Guys I have an idea of a coin that can be actually useful in the real life. I worked on this idea for the last two years. I think it would be easier to develop it as a KMD token initially. As I'm not a developer I'll probably need to find a developer to work on the idea with me. I think the additional modules would be needed for my idea to become reality here. So I'd need to ask whether the modules should be written in C++, so I'll be looking for the developer with the right specialization.

[28-Sep-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
C++ would be best for custom modules, if existing modules can be used, then any language can be used to issue api calls

[28-Sep-19 04:43 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Thank you for replay! I'd like also to ask. Creating additional modules is the only way to make "smart contracts" or the "rules" for my token can be just created with C++ without the code being part of a module?

[28-Sep-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
your question doesnt make technical sense. maybe easier to ask what you want to do that try to speak about technical details

[28-Sep-19 05:22 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
For instance I'd like my tokens to have voting rights and I'd need them to have privacy option enabled, but it's not available as module yet AFAIK. So what I'm asking myself is whether a specific module has to be created or a developer that possibly would work on this idea will just need to create a code for my specific token.

[28-Sep-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
mixing privacy with special rights is not easy to do

[28-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is solvable,then a dev would be needed

[28-Sep-19 05:24 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
you mean privacy with voting right?

[28-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you can do a private voting using a onetime coin just for voting

[28-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then use zaddr for voting destination

[28-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the one with most coins wins

[28-Sep-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
this is built in functionality, no need for custom

[28-Sep-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
without more details, only general advice can be given

[28-Sep-19 05:26 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
I understand of course it's difficult to speak generally

[28-Sep-19 05:26 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
The thing is that I have a new consensus mechanism in mind.

[28-Sep-19 05:26 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Or more precisely the evolution of an existent one.

[28-Sep-19 05:27 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
This consensus mechanism at present time is possible to realize only on the base of KMD technology, if any.

[28-Sep-19 05:28 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
But I'm afraid I won't be able to find a good dev to realize this idea on a separate blockchain, at least not as soon as I'd like to, so I was thinking about a kind of imitation of this mechanism under the form of smart contract.

[28-Sep-19 05:29 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Supposing it would be easier. So once the idea is live maybe it would be easier to attract the interest of a good developer(s).

[28-Sep-19 05:30 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
For obvious reasons speaking about this idea publicly in detail while it's just an idea doesn't make too much sense.

[28-Sep-19 05:37 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
But what I'm trying to do is to release tokens with voting rights and privacy option (to protect the voters), that would vote on the distribution of funds (to fund the projects), this part is similar to masternodes voting.

[28-Sep-19 05:40 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
So if the tokens are being sent to a zaddr to vote once there is a winner the funds available on another address should be transferred to the winning address and the tokens have to be returned to their original owners. In the ideal voting process there shouldn't be any fee payment involved if not nobody will be willing to vote.

[28-Sep-19 05:40 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
This is the key of what I'd need to create (at least the other parts I'd need are already in place in the Antara Framework, as far a I can see). Is it possible to realize this part without being a C++ programmer?

[28-Sep-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you can just make a special voting chain to handle the voting, but probably you will want some sort of GUI

[28-Sep-19 06:54 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
Thank you very much!

[29-Sep-19 01:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @johnwhitestar ,
I'm also looking for a way to conduct a private vote. 
Unfortunately, I don't have much in the way of technical skills. 
There has been some discussion of this in #kmdlabs .

I'm trying to mess with TokensCC using Rick chain. At first I did this
```komodod -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_staked=10 -addnode=95.217.44.48 -addnode=138.201.136.145```


Then `getnewaddress` then `validateaddress` and got privkey with `dumpprivkey`
and then stopped the daemon.

However when I try to restart it with 
```komodod -pubkey=PUBKEY -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_staked=10 -addnode=95.217.44.48 -addnode=138.201.136.145```

It doesn't do anything. just starts a new line in CLI. 

Any idea why this won't run? It runs fine without the pubkey param

[09-Oct-19 10:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you using pubkey as pubkey param? Just not sure why you've dumped privkey

[09-Oct-19 10:39 PM] Regnar#6164
i dumped privkey just because I wanted to save it lol

[09-Oct-19 10:39 PM] Regnar#6164

okay so I got RICK all synced up and Tokens CC seems to be working `tokenaddress` returns success. I have 7.77 RICK and I'm attempting to make a test token using `tokencreate` However I'm getting this response

[11-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Regnar#6164
I've got another question. If I want to send tokens to someone I would use `tokentransfer`, but this requires I have their pubkey. <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html#tokentransfer>

Is there another way to send tokens? It says:
`The tokentransfer method transfers tokens from one Antara Address to another.`

[11-Oct-19 01:51 AM] Regnar#6164
I can get `scriptPubKey` of an address using Komodod's `validateaddress` but I don't think this is what I need

[11-Oct-19 01:52 AM] Regnar#6164
So simply asked, How do I send tokens to an address without knowing their pubkey?

[11-Oct-19 02:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@Regnar they are effectively being transfered from one address to another
but the thing to provide is a pubkey

Pubkey is the address equivalent for Antara modules

[11-Oct-19 02:14 AM] Regnar#6164
right, I thought the only way to find the pubkey for an address you don't own is only if they give it to you, or spend with it.

[11-Oct-19 02:14 AM] gcharang#6833
thats true

[11-Oct-19 02:15 AM] gcharang#6833
so users have to share pubkeys for moving tokens

[11-Oct-19 02:39 AM] Regnar#6164
yea that's what I was hoping to get around

[11-Oct-19 02:40 AM] Regnar#6164
but it looks like you can only send tokens to pubkeys

[11-Oct-19 03:04 AM] Regnar#6164
I think that bit is above my head, why you wouldn't be able to send tokens to an address. Worst case people share pubkeys but I think that would be kind of a pain for average users. Is there a reason they can't be sent to an address?

[11-Oct-19 03:26 AM] gcharang#6833
addresses are just hashed and prettified pubkeys that have less characters and builtin error protection
any GUI wallet that deals with addresses can deal with pubkeys just as easily
maybe they can be shared as qr codes?
what do you think is different between copy/pasting an address and copy/pasting a pubkey for a user?
@Regnar 

the reason pubkeys are used for Antara modules is because thay are the raw form and needed for validating any kind of signature.
 even with addresses, to validate a signature, the pubkey needs to be submitted

just using the pubkey directly makes writing the validation code easier for Antara modules

[11-Oct-19 03:30 AM] CrisF#3405
For final production use won't the most of that be hidden or simplified by the GUI anyhow?

[11-Oct-19 03:33 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been trying out some things with tokens also @Regnar . Interested to hear more of your ideas on them.

There are 2 chains with token enabled in Labs now. `CFEKMYLO` AND `CFEKMYLO6`.  I was testing out token migrations between the chain (NFT).

[11-Oct-19 04:01 AM] Regnar#6164
I guess I was thinking people might be used to looking at addresses in block explorers, and also many wallets currently don't display public keys for simplicity.

 I guess if a chain is going to have tokens, they would make public keys more accessible in their wallet GUIs, but you might get issues like 3rd party wallets which hide that functionality and make it difficult for users to send tokens to one another. Kind of a non issue right now though

[11-Oct-19 04:09 AM] Regnar#6164
I guess I still don't understand the reason for sending to a pubkey over a regular address. It seems to make it more difficult to send to people, or new addresses you don't own. You have to contact someone to get their pubkey?

 Why do we send coins to addresses?

[11-Oct-19 04:10 AM] gcharang#6833

This came about because I knew a friends wallet address but not his pubkey, and I wanted to send him some test tokens.

[11-Oct-19 04:20 AM] gcharang#6833
In the future, where there is a gui for Antara modules, the default thing to be shared will have to be a string that has both the pubkey and address in it
this way the pubkey can be validated

[11-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Though I don't think his wallet has GUI access to pub keys, I'll have to look. But it does have a seed. So for the test I would send it to him, and if he ever wanted to claim them he'd have to import seed into a wallet that supports tokens. Lol and that's how I got here

[11-Oct-19 04:21 AM] gcharang#6833
>  he'd have to import seed into a wallet that supports tokens
right, and there is no such gui right now

[11-Oct-19 04:23 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea, the issue for us is more that I can't send to his address for him to claim at a later date(even importing into Komodod), because his wallet only seems to support Addresses.
