@siu - Chainmakers are you using daemon version with oracles support and is ORCL daemon runned? Just tested version from github and worked ok for me.

i did had an issue with the script because of python3.6

not specific version of 3

[09-Sep-18 05:24 PM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers thank you for testing! I've declared 3.6 strict in my code, guess it was a mistake. Let me try to change it.
Just started with Python few weeks ago. Didn't think much about compatibility...

[09-Sep-18 05:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sure, that is what im here for 😃

[09-Sep-18 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
From python3.6 changelog:
```json
json.load() and json.loads() now support binary input. Encoded JSON should be represented using either UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in bpo-17909.)```
So Python version is actually is an issue why it's not running on your side @siu - Chainmakers
Please try:
```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6 libpython3.6```
To install python3.6. I'll try to rewrite these places without 3.6 specifics usage to make it more compatible.

In order to create a new gateway it is necessary to follow some strict steps.
 1. create a token with the max possible supply that will be issued
 2. transfer 100% of them to the gateways CC's global pubkey's asset CC address. (yes it is a bit confusing)
 3. create an oracle with the identical name, ie. KMD and format must start with Ihh (height, blockhash, merkleroot)
 4. register a publisher and fund it with a subscribe. there will be a special client app that will automatically publish the merkleroots.
 5. Now a gatewaysbind can bind an external coin to an asset, along with the oracle for the merkleroots. the txid from the bind is used in most of the other gateways CC calls

Pinned a message.

[10-Sep-18 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
now there is a gateway for KMD that will automatically issue a token when it is deposited, at least when I get it debugged. the commands up to gatewaysbind appear to work, so at least you can get ready to get gateways setup. I need to get the deposit processing and merkleroot posting done, then it can be automatically issuing a KMD deposit to the gateway address and then it will transfer a matching amount of locked assets.

[10-Sep-18 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are familiar with multigateway, this is a slightly improved and more flexible form

[10-Sep-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
there is trust needed that the merkle data from the oracles are correct and also that the gateway deposit address signers wont steal the coins. For now I will debug a non-msig just to simplify the debugging, but ultimately it will be a multisig among several trusted community members. as long as they dont majority collude and keep the special gateway publisher app, the withdraws will be automated. even without this being run, the deposits are automated as long as the merkle data is there

[10-Sep-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
at least, that is the design of what I coded yesterday. yes, it is all of one day since I started the coding for this

[10-Sep-18 02:10 PM] Alright#0419
Ok, pretty excited to test this. I'm not at all familiar with MGW. What this does is allow someone to deposit some coin, claim those coins as assets on KMD/assetchain, trade them from there for the native coin? Am I understanding that correctly?

[10-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Alright#0419
👌

[10-Sep-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the deposit side for MGW also relied on the signing nodes to be online

[10-Sep-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
with gateways CC, the deposit side uses the "standard" SPV validation/crosschain method to validate a coin deposit

[10-Sep-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why an oracle is needed, to post the merkleroots of the coin (in this case KMD) to the localchain

[10-Sep-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
another improvement over MGW was that before the assets representing the coin had no way to restrict its transfer

[10-Sep-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
however with CC, only a valid deposit will release any of the locked coins

[10-Sep-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
this eliminates a significant trust point, and something that none of the other proxy based DEX solves

[10-Sep-18 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maintaining a 1:1 backing of the asset with the coin is critical and until now, this wasnt CC enforced

[10-Sep-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I am assuming we will get a DEX for assets and if I can figure out how to do a 1:1 KMD <-> assetchain peg, then we can have a KMD equivalent DEX for whatever other coins there is a gateway for. onchain DEX, like all the rest, but it seems what people are willing to use due to performance issues

@siu - Chainmakers great that it's worked!
For file transfer file content at the moment should be strictly match the oracle valid input (eg if it's text it should be hex with length in each line). Later I want to make some converter - from text to hex let's say (converting string to hex + adding length bytes). So you'll able to transfer texts to blockchain on fly.
I've tested it only when file locating in the same directory with script

`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'saludos'`
I guess there is no such file 😃

[10-Sep-18 03:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, will try again

[10-Sep-18 03:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
finally got it working! :p

i would recommend for a print of the oracles sample when the transactions is done

[10-Sep-18 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Yahoo!

[10-Sep-18 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes it'll be done, since tool will also compare input and output

[10-Sep-18 03:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Pushed yesterday version which can only publish data to blockchain - didn't think someone will play with it 😃

[10-Sep-18 03:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
😂

[10-Sep-18 03:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
anything that can simplify this would be nice

[10-Sep-18 03:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I would like to start doing a hurricane forecast feed :p

[10-Sep-18 03:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and a bitcoi price feed :p

[10-Sep-18 03:16 PM] TonyL#3577
In this repo one more tool  `trading.py` - can create token if needed 😃

[10-Sep-18 03:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example i would like to find a way to feed the info on this website to a blockchain http://spaghettimodels.com/

[10-Sep-18 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
You have to make some dapp - there is an very good example in `cc/dapps` - JL's dAPP which grab BTC price and oraclize

[10-Sep-18 03:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would html code be oraclelizable?

[10-Sep-18 03:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
(or however oracle as a verb is written)

[10-Sep-18 03:25 PM] TonyL#3577
If data is in html I think it's better to parse it first to take only part which you need

[10-Sep-18 03:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean to somehow "host" a static website on the blockchain.

[10-Sep-18 03:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I would like to see how this oracle contract can be applied to do some kind of steemit social media

[10-Sep-18 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
I think why not

[10-Sep-18 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Posts data can be oraclized

do you have write privs to /tmp

[10-Sep-18 06:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh... no, didnt run it with sudo

@Alright saw your post about needing notary nodes for staked. 

I might be interested. Could be good for the documentation effort. What does it require?
