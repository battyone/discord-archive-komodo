fix CC mempool processing by jl777 ¬∑ Pull Request #1062 ¬∑ jl777/...

[12-Dec-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know if it works. it is in jl777 branch

[12-Dec-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo once you confirm it fixes the mempool problem, I will merge it

[12-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Just testing it

[12-Dec-18 05:39 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c It seems to work nicely üëè

[12-Dec-18 05:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, I now understand this output `ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found` but still I'm intrigued how is this printed as I cannot nowhere in code except one place where it is commented üòÆ

[12-Dec-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
old version?

[12-Dec-18 06:19 PM] Mihailo#5902
Don't know for older but it prints now.

[12-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Mihailo#5902
But it works normal. It is probably printed when tx is broadcasted from other node and the broadcast is also not in the correct order. What I can understand is how it gets printed as there is nothing in the code...

[12-Dec-18 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe from a different coin daemon running the version with the printout?

[12-Dec-18 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, but it ends up in the logfile...

[12-Dec-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
gremlins again?

[12-Dec-18 06:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
It looks like gremlins, but there must be some logical explaniation

[12-Dec-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it must be you are running a version with the printout in it

[12-Dec-18 06:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
I compiled jl777 branch, and ran it on all nodes. And I never uncommented this print...

[12-Dec-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you:
grep "tx inputs not found" komodod

[12-Dec-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
is the string in the executable

[12-Dec-18 07:41 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'll check it out... i greped the whole src dir.

[12-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
Greped komodod on that node and it has that output. So I switched to jl777 branch but I did not do  git pull. As I said, there is some logical explanation üòâ

[13-Dec-18 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I knew there was something wrong with that mempool fix... Looks like the solution is nice and simple at least.

[13-Dec-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo so the version that confirms the mempool behavior was fixed wasnt the latest version?

[13-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Mihailo#5902
???

[13-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, that was only on one node. The fix is correct and works.

[13-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, just checking

@Mihailo Making unit tests for ChannelsCC, seems `channelsrefund` is not work at the moment:
```error code: -26
error message:
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)```
Get this error on `channelsrefund` transaction broadcast

[13-Dec-18 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/kYHdDv864r/ here is a full flow

[13-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL Have you waited for close to be confirmed?

[13-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
Can you give me daemon output also?

[13-Dec-18 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, right. How many times it should be confirmed?

[13-Dec-18 11:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
If you did not complie iwth TESTMODE than 101, but when using TESTMODE then it is 2. If chain has notarization then after block is notarized.

[13-Dec-18 12:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
I made RPC call txnotarizedocnfirmed to test if tx is confirmed/notarized for CC purposes

[13-Dec-18 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, it's a clue I think since I have default compiled daemons at the moment

[13-Dec-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Enabled daemon output, it's telling me about it yeah:
```CC Eval EVAL_CHANNELS Invalid: channelOpen is not yet confirmed(notarised)! spending tx b64d277f3f367a29cf98d7d11480dd3d82cdfe20f24daaac6c7b16500854886b
```
Thanks @Mihailo !

[13-Dec-18 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
But I guess "channelClose" is not yet confirmed, not "channelOpen"
Or opening transaction have to be confirmed/notarised X times as well?

[13-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
What is the close txid

[13-Dec-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, actually ```CC Eval EVAL_CHANNELS Invalid: channelOpen is not yet confirmed(notarised)! spending tx b64d277f3f367a29cf98d7d11480dd3d82cdfe20f24daaac6c7b16500854886b``` this printout I get in my tests on `channelspayment` tx broadcast
Sorry for things messing up, investigating

[13-Dec-18 12:06 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, so open must be confirmed before payment can be done. Also close must be confirmed before refund can be done.

[13-Dec-18 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Gotcha, will generate needed extra blocks

[13-Dec-18 12:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
You can use RPC txnotarizedocnfirmed for unit tests so that they do not go to next tx until previous is confirmed.

[13-Dec-18 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
I have ```'confirmations': 2``` on channel opening transaction in tests but getting:
```CC Eval EVAL_CHANNELS Invalid: channelOpen is not yet confirmed(notarised)! spending tx a3bff136ee651c0abf8c84b88a01e58a9eab5b504c5759c3d62fe1e95533f88d
DEBUG:BitcoinRPC:<-- {"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":26}```
On normal chain I can send `channelpayment` right after `channelopen` transction mined
So it should be some specific thing for `regtest` mode. Will spin now `-regtest` chain outside of test framework to doublecheck it

[13-Dec-18 12:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
You shouldn't be able to send payment on either chains. There is a check in validation if open is confirme/notarized.

[13-Dec-18 12:27 PM] Mihailo#5902
Try with make clean and then build client:
```
export CONFIGURE_FLAGS='CPPFLAGS=-DTESTMODE'
./zcutil/build.sh -j8
```

[13-Dec-18 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @Mihailo it's work correct after I've rebuilt.
It was my brain-lag - just realised that on non test framework chain  I've opened channel yesterday - so channel opening transaction just have needed `101+` confirmations

[14-Dec-18 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
And now it's executing 6 times faster since 100 blocks pre-generates only once if you want to test all CCs - realised that it'll be a problem when CCs amount will grow. There is not beautiful logic now and order in which tests execute is matters (faucet have to be first because other way address will be not brand new, gateways tests create token and oracle so tokens and oracles list will be not empty - thats why gateways test should be after oracles and tokens tests and so on)

[14-Dec-18 06:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL very nice work, i will take a look

[14-Dec-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL nice commit message. I feel like some that should go into a README or docs somewhere. we dont' have good docs for how to run the test suite with various options right now

[14-Dec-18 06:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not friendly to newcomers, we could change that with some developer docs

[14-Dec-18 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
in theory the tests should be isolated as much as possible, but in practice, we do the best we can

[14-Dec-18 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i ran into the same issues, and had to order tests very particularly

[14-Dec-18 06:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i see you updated `qa/rpc-tests/README.md`, very nice

[14-Dec-18 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
our CC tests are really starting to evolve, nice to see

[14-Dec-18 07:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks for a feedback @dukeleto ! Seems nobody else use these tests so far so I'm not sure what might be useful for newcomer in Readme besides the info which it already have - for me information in Readme was enough for start.
 I'm ready to improve it on any demand/feedback. 
Yup, our tests are growing üôå  Only issue I don't like now is that sometimes to stop komodods after tests finished I need to ```rm -rf /tmp/*
pkill komodod
``` 
But I think I've almost found how to resolve it (besides of execution of code above in .sh directly)))

@TonyL that thing you notice, when you sometimes have to manually kill regtest daemons, that is somewhat expected

[14-Dec-18 08:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
if the test suite dies, in certain ways, sometimes regtest daemons do not get cleaned up properly. Exceptions in the test suite libraries themselves. Perhaps we can add more try/catch somewhere to fix this

[14-Dec-18 08:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
so even if you tell the test suite to clean up, sometimes it fails so hard it does not

[14-Dec-18 08:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see this regularly, when messing with test libraries themselves

[14-Dec-18 08:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
not when messing with test files

[14-Dec-18 08:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
we have a very ancient version of the python test suite for BTC, the most recent stuff in BTC core is much nicer

[14-Dec-18 08:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC does not have that stuff yet either

[14-Dec-18 08:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, latest BTC python test suite, you don't have to manually maintain a list of test files

[14-Dec-18 08:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
it will auto-recognize it if the file exists

[14-Dec-18 08:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
current implementation is .... ugly, imho. But that is what we inherited from btc 0.11

[14-Dec-18 08:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, python2 + dat .sh script with list seems like an old school )
In general daemons killing is ok as far as tests working correct

[14-Dec-18 08:44 PM] TonyL#3577
In general I can make super leightweight tests framework for CC only from 1-2 files I think

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think we do need to have a CryptoConditionsTest class that multiple files can inherit from

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
then the code in each file will be only a few lines

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
where as right now, there is a lot of duplication between cc test files, for simplicity

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, definetly

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
now that we have a few cc test files, i think we are at that point

[14-Dec-18 08:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
to make a class, and all those files inherit from that. You will see this pattern throughout the test suite

[14-Dec-18 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
`setup_chain` `setup_network` `run_test` `send_and_mine` are duplicating all over the CC tests, so possible to move it to common class and inherit then

[14-Dec-18 08:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, the pattern emerges once a few test files are written

[14-Dec-18 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Great, was in my todo list actually üëç Will make this class and adjust existing CC tests

[14-Dec-18 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
While there are not a hundreds of CCs yet - things are still under control üòÇ
