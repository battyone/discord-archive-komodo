hex is 0,1,2,...9,a,b,c,d,e,f

[06-Sep-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only those

[06-Sep-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
16 different hex chars

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
takes 4 bits to encode it, since 2*2*2*2 is 16

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
a byte has 8 bits

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
4+4 is 8

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i know it is really complex stuff, sorry

[06-Sep-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
2 hex chars -> one byte since 4+4 equals 8

[06-Sep-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
for strings each character is represented by ASCII,some standard from the past

[06-Sep-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is usually shown in decimal, but probably can find a hex encoding for ASCII

[06-Sep-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
each letter -> one byte -> 2 hex chars

[06-Sep-18 01:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so in `s` format only 8 characters are possible?

[06-Sep-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
255

[06-Sep-18 01:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[06-Sep-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
16 times 16 is 256

@jl777c I'm receiving empty output after input to 'd' (tried just 011) and 'S' (tried 1000 symbols input)

[06-Sep-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
what was exact 'd' oraclesdata rpc call that failed?

[06-Sep-18 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCL oraclesdata a31286453124ee7b60c838c1ee681a26ce9553b98bc8593b45fad6ffc87effe2 011`

[06-Sep-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
011 has odd number of chars, immediately illegal

[06-Sep-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you wanted 0101 ?

[06-Sep-18 01:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I wanted to put just 1 bit of binary

[06-Sep-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
must always be even number of chars, otherwise will have a half a byte

[06-Sep-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
1 byte is the least you can have

[06-Sep-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
that is 8 bites

[06-Sep-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
8 bits

[06-Sep-18 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so length in case of binary format means not the amount of chars but amount of bytes?

[06-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
just like for 's'

[06-Sep-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant write half a byte out to the blockchain

[06-Sep-18 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought 'd' format can parse 1 and 0 as bits somehow so possible to make boolean by 1 bit input

[06-Sep-18 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
But it's operating with bytes

[06-Sep-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
well it could, but ultimately one byte is the smallest amount that can be written to the blockchain, so there is no point for higher resolution

[06-Sep-18 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Great, now clear

[06-Sep-18 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
So what is the most elegant way to implement boolean as data type?

[06-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the 'S' issue could be a bug as it looked ok from your description, so need the actual rpc call

[06-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
boolean would be 00 or 01

[06-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
with 7 bits wasted

[06-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
you could pack 8 booleans into a single byte

[06-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is up to the caller of the rpc to encode it

[06-Sep-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
with 'd' you can put encrypted data in the hex

[06-Sep-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what value is that?

[06-Sep-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
59395

[06-Sep-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
plz understand little endian

[06-Sep-18 01:55 PM] TonyL#3577
03e8 planned  as 1000

[06-Sep-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
from google: https://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-15/ass15_3.html

[06-Sep-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
e803 is the little endian 1000, 03e8 is big endian, which is opposite of little endian

[06-Sep-18 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @jl777c ! Was clear what is it - didn't know that same logic using when declaring length

[06-Sep-18 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to understand better how CC working with data

[06-Sep-18 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is arbitrary

[06-Sep-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is simpler to always use little endian

[06-Sep-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of randomly picking little vs big for every possible case

[06-Sep-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin protocol has big endian and little endian depending on, well, random decisions made at the time

[06-Sep-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so that means you need to guess which endian-ness is used for every number bigger than 1 byte

[06-Sep-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
I chose to avoid that by always using little endian

[06-Sep-18 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see

[06-Sep-18 02:08 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c After send data with little endian length (same data as in my doc but e803):

[06-Sep-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, try with 256 bytes

[06-Sep-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
or did it crash?

[06-Sep-18 02:10 PM] TonyL#3577
`2018-09-06 14:05:55 ERROR: ContextualCheckBlockHeader: incorrect proof of work`
And was only this error in daemon (I guess after I broadcast)

[06-Sep-18 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
256 bytes type ('s') I've tested already and it worked as expected. 
There was only 1 byte in length so was not possible to miss the order :trollface:

[06-Sep-18 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but 256 doesnt fit in 1 byte?

[06-Sep-18 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
*255

[06-Sep-18 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I have to rest a lil bit, lost concentration lol

[06-Sep-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why i asked to test 256, smallest of the 2 byte

it gets the bitcoin price and writes it out
format of "L"
yo have to manually create an oracle txid, register and subscribe
then it just loops every minute. it might get an error if the prior one isnt confirmed
FSM branch
```

Also have to change assetchain ID to needed in daemon calls (AT5 at the moment). Maybe make asset chain name as definable variable as well?

@jl777c How to compile it properly? I've tried  `gcc -Wall oraclefeed.c -o oraclefeed` but receiving errors:

gcc -c oraclefeed.c -lm

[07-Sep-18 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i plan to make all the things like acname, txid, etc. command line args.

[07-Sep-18 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c And then I should use object file as executable?

[07-Sep-18 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
```./oraclefeed.o 
-bash: ./oraclefeed.o: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error``` I've tried this way but no luck

[07-Sep-18 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Or it's kinda library which will connect when I'll re-compile whole komodo?

[07-Sep-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
a.out

[07-Sep-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming unix

[07-Sep-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if you add -o name then it generates file called "name"

[07-Sep-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry shouldnt have put the -c

[07-Sep-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
gcc oraclefeed.c -lm
