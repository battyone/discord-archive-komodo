But I'm repeating myself. We need the pubkey to send to

[11-Oct-19 04:23 AM] gcharang#6833
which wallet is he using?

[11-Oct-19 04:24 AM] gcharang#6833
if he is using nativemode, he can get the pubkey

[11-Oct-19 04:25 AM] Regnar#6164
It's a mobile. Idk which one yet, he said earlier he couldn't find pub keys anywhere.

[11-Oct-19 04:25 AM] Regnar#6164
But like I said, sending to him wasn't so he could look at or interact with the tokens, it was strictly so he would have them for a later date.

[11-Oct-19 04:25 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, no litemode wallet has the need to expose pubkeys to users currently

[11-Oct-19 04:25 AM] Regnar#6164
Nuanced case perhaps

[11-Oct-19 04:26 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea seems that way. I was just trying to give ownership to him, to claim at later date whenever he pleased.

[11-Oct-19 04:27 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay. Going to bed, thanks for the explanation

[11-Oct-19 04:28 AM] gcharang#6833
np, he can always export the privkey or seed and use the ocean wallet to get the pubkey
no need to even sync the blockchain

[11-Oct-19 04:28 AM] gcharang#6833

[11-Oct-19 04:31 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that was the plan, but for using the tokens, not to just receive them. Unfortunately I think we may be on our own with mobile wallets not providing pubkey, and probably going to have Tokens compared to ERC20 and the inability to send directly to an address. 

Okay that's all, night

nspv wallet displays pubkey

[11-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay onward for my tokenCC knowledge! 

I understand there aren't any explorers to look at tokens yet (that I know of) but was looking at my token on the RICK explorer and noticed the RICK I used to create the tokens is reading as zero on the explorer.

Is this normal or a bug?

[11-Oct-19 12:44 PM] gcharang#6833
the current explorers aren't equipped to deal with cc transactions
can you share the link to txn?

[11-Oct-19 12:45 PM] Regnar#6164
I figured I couldn't see any of the token stuff, just didn't expect to see the 0.00000777 KMD (RICK) going to an address and then showing as zero balance for the address

[11-Oct-19 12:46 PM] gcharang#6833
the zero value output is an opreturn utxo
it is used to store data
<https://rick.kmd.dev/insight-api-komodo/tx/f591850f9bd94352a6461a45909db80d5d8549746c766ef5e08ed2959ba089c5>

[11-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't understand what that means exactly. I understand storing values in op_return. 

What does that value mean? It's a hash if something?

[11-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Regnar#6164
So the 777 satoshi is stored in the op_return value, as a utxo?

[11-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Regnar#6164
Or behaves as one?

[11-Oct-19 12:57 PM] gcharang#6833
> showing as zero balance for the address

the address RMDvABbzXVnD7CwAZyMeBQXCvmMqH1iwsY isn't a normal KMD address
it is an address that is specific to tokens cc and modified by its eval code

the 777 sats are locked by the tokens cc: 
```
"asm": "a22c802044d7a309196f78e8948b1bc446dfb1b3ceae1a0725bd89f07c7ecea922042c988103120c008203000401 OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION"
```
do you understand the bitcoin script some what? like OP_CHECKSIG, OP_DUP etc ?

CC addresses and normal addresses are different "locations" even if they are the same address

[11-Oct-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
there are rpc calls to get the tokenbalance

[11-Oct-19 04:02 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I started making some Python wrappers for TokensCC and saw that. Can someone send to CC addresses like the `RMDvA...` one above? Or is pubkey the only way?

[11-Oct-19 04:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@Regnar sending normal coins to RMDvABbzXVnD7CwAZyMeBQXCvmMqH1iwsY uisng sendtoaddress will send the coins to an address no one knows the private key of

the address in the context of tokens is hash(evalcode + pubkey + ....) both of them are different

the easiest way to deal with antara modules is to just use the RPC calls corresponding to them
the implementation details are not really important as far as a user is concerned
the only change would be dealing with a longer string (pubkey vs address)

[11-Oct-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is based on pubkey

[11-Oct-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the display of pubkey as an address is basically an arbitrary thing

[11-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay. Sounds good. I planned to just use the RPCs as given, but wasn't really sure what the reasons were for the different CC addresses. Good to know, don't send to them

[11-Oct-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
CC funds are constrained, so just having the privkey isnt enough. and if you send normal funds to a CC address, well you actually cant do that, as they operate in different "dimensions"

[11-Oct-19 04:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay I think I got it. I'm reading through the CC guide right now

[11-Oct-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
there is literally a CCflag that denotes if an address is a CC address or a normal address, in the addresindex DB entries

[11-Oct-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
users should not be using sendtoaddress to send to CC addresses, as sendtoaddress sends to only normal addresses

[11-Oct-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to use the proper CC rpc call to do the CC tx

[11-Oct-19 04:44 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea for this I think it's `tokentransfer`

[11-Oct-19 04:45 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm just trying to get a grasp on all the addresses and details so I can understand it a bit better. Appreciate all the help here üòÅ

it just doesnt fit into any preexisting "box" so you need to make new boxes

[11-Oct-19 06:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c does sending normal funds to a CC address make the funds unspendable and hence "burned" for practical purposes?

[11-Oct-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the CC vout hash is hash of the scriptPubKey, which is a CC vout and not a pubkey. so if you sendtoaddress normal funds to a p2pkh address, odds are you will never find the matching privkey. would need a hash collision between the hash of pubkey and hash of CC vout (which itself is mostly a hash of the CC condition)

[11-Oct-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
however, it wont be provably unspendable

[11-Oct-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just practically unspendable

[11-Oct-19 07:11 PM] dukeleto#7326

no. except for specific IPs. I don't want anyone to connect.

[16-Oct-19 01:17 AM] gcharang#6833
@Paro 
you can use `-connect` to make sure your own node connects to only certain other ip addresses
but you can't control the  other nodes running the same chain connecting to different ip addresses

@jl777c @Mihailo 
About that new finite state machine (FSM) CC module which is planned to create.
---
I looked through several implementations and seems this tasks is very well defined and it is not very hard to create it as a cc module.
Here is a nice one for pure c https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1275479/State-Machine-Design-in-C
It implements a basic FSM engine and provides macros to create state and event functions and transition map. 
Also it has useful concepts like guard conditions, entry and exit actions (seems this is derived from UML and this is good)
The important thing is that it supports both internal and external events. Internal events are those which are generated by the state machine.
I think in case of blockchain internal events could be timeouts and address spends or other blockchain events (mentioned in the article in medium.com) so we could provide implementations of some basic functions (for example to implement 'payments').
As external event are supplied by oracles we need to apply additional rules for event data formats (which are oracle formats).
Miners could perform evaluation of state machine (check for events and state transitions) who could take some tx fee as a reward.
---
For which applications is the FSM CC?
In this codeproject example for each FSM application it should be created a specific event and state code (like for motor or centrifuge FSMs in the example).
Do we think that we could provide some set of event and state functions in the which could be used for many FSM configurations?
Is there a specific application domain for which we provide this FSM CC? (That is, we do not want to allow to make a 'Motor State Machine' like in the example, and if this is only about coins or tokens it is easier to develop a some function set for the FSM CC)?
Or maybe we could allow to attach some library to the FSM CC with externally defined event and state processing functions?

State Machine Design in C
A compact C finite state machine (FSM) implementation that's easy to use on embedded and PC-based systems.

[25-Oct-19 07:25 PM] dimxy#2587
---
To manage events I think it is good to use 1of2 address 'FSM CC global address' + 'FSM initial txid address', so miners could send events (probably not events, but state transitions) between FSMs instances.
---
A FSM CC config could be a json which defines a state list, events and state transition map (similar to the example) and also binds an oracle txid.
Events are triggered by oracles data and miners create a state transition transactions.

[26-Oct-19 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM CC should allow to create an arbitrary FSM via opreturn definitions. it should support a nested FSM, so you can create an FSM of arbitrary size. We need to define and implement a comprehensive set of blockchain events as the idea is to make the FSM CC and then after that essentially any logic can be implemented. standardizing the arguments and return values will allow creation of complex events and actions, though if all actions are built in, there is no need to make those nested.

[26-Oct-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
A test of the FSM spec is to have half a dozen usecases and to make sure all of them can be implemented

[26-Oct-19 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
as you say by having a standard oracles interface we can bring in external events into the statemachine. it should also be possible to create an oracle event based on the state changes of an FSM. this way, a specific FSM can create an event that is then used by other FSM.

[26-Oct-19 04:50 AM] jl777c#5810
At the high level, we want to use FSM to provide as close to turing completeness as practical. For blockchains, turing completeness is overkill and ends up with resource consumption issues. With FSM, the processing of events is the only thing that is taking any time, and really it wouldnt be that much time, and most blockchain dapps logic can be done with a FSM

[26-Oct-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
I think the simplest FSM would be of the form: lock funds into the FSM, if an oracle posts the expected data send release payment. if a timeout happens, the funds can go to the one that put in the funds

[26-Oct-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so the FSM CC would allow to define such an fsm and we would have this as a template. then any new oracle can be used to make an oracle controlled payment. just during the initial blocks, the chain creator should run the standard FSM templates and we get a list of txids, one for each of the standard FSM

[26-Oct-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
given these txids, specific instances of the standard FSM can be created, and by created, i mean the locking in of funds

[26-Oct-19 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so we have the templates of FSM (state maps, events, actions) and specific instances of a template (with all the txids defined).

[26-Oct-19 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
fsmdefine to define the state maps, parameters, return values, actions

[26-Oct-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
fsmcreate <defined txid> <amount> <parameters> to create a specific instance

[26-Oct-19 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
once a specific instance is created, it is up to the dapp to notice the trigger events or timeouts and create a state transition transaction. what that means is that regardless of the number of active FSM instances, there is no overhead for polling of events! only when the dapp submits a transaction, will it need to be evaluated and by having it pass in the most recent txid, we can simply look up the current state it is in (as that is part of the required data), find the state map and make sure the submitted tx is following the FSM definition

[26-Oct-19 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
of course each dapp will need to be polling for events that it cares about, but this is non-consensus load and if you have money at stake, it is not a problem to be running code to look for events.

[26-Oct-19 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to support crosschain events, so part of the state transition tx in this case would be the txproof for the crosschain tx (likely an oracle, but could be a spend of a specific utxo, etc)

[26-Oct-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
events could be oracle data, spend of utxo, passage of time, height, balance of an address going above/below specified amount, DTO price calculation above/below, DTO price calculation of A > DTO price B, etc, etc, etc

[26-Oct-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
