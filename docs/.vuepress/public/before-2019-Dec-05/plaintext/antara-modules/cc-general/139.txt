[02-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
can't reproduce the error

[02-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
with either hex

[02-Dec-18 08:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe with sapling activated wrong size will not get you a blank post, it will jus tnot go through?

[02-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
both work here

[02-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
thanks again for not trying those 3 commands though that would have told us the same thing much earlier

[02-Dec-18 08:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im not even trying the ones i did earlier since im not in my computer

[02-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=SPLTEST oraclesdata 26fe59203720cfb061e51e2babd057b96f053e459471dd52afafe0ab1fe9d005 0500484f4c41210a`

@SHossain both of these worked for me

[02-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
did you have an error for either?

```

[02-Dec-18 08:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe there is a limit for entropy tx in oracles now like there is in dice?

[02-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
are either of your still able to reliably reproduce the error?

[02-Dec-18 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
without datafee, there will be an error

[02-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
the stack element error

[02-Dec-18 08:57 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm waiting for the previous txs to be confirmed before i used your `send.py`

[02-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
the datafee thing was because I thought txs were confirmed when they were not

[02-Dec-18 08:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
datafee as in oraclessubscribe?

[02-Dec-18 08:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or datafee is something new?

[02-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
you set datafee when you register to an oracle

[02-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
it's the amount of coins you want to receive each time you do oraclesdata

[02-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Alright#0419
in sats

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
```
./send.py SPLTEST c0f7a20fe78fa47992a8add42a6a9b50fb1540b8604d69eb120ffe81713ee778
Type message: 
```

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if there isnt enough datafee prepaid, you cant publish

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright what would be the message?

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
anything

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
it's chat lol

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i put 10000 satoshis as datafee

[02-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
SHo, you got the stack element error with the HOLA! hex at one point yes?

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
can you try the exact command again if so

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then do 2 txs of 1

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
should be enough if im the only one posting, right?

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
the amount of times you subscribe is the amount of UTXOs you have

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
the amount of times you can do oraclesdata in a single block

[02-Dec-18 09:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so 2 should be ok

[02-Dec-18 09:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for personal testing purposes

[02-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
reproduced it I think

[02-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c stdout has these prints 
```

[02-Dec-18 09:03 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, when i type message `Hello` and press enter i see `cc_verify error C` in colsole

[02-Dec-18 09:04 PM] SHossain#0007
with your `send.py`

[02-Dec-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the hex is changes a little the error goes away?

[02-Dec-18 09:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a little in what sense?

[02-Dec-18 09:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the hex submitted?

[02-Dec-18 09:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no, it outputs the same error, right or wrong

[02-Dec-18 09:08 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem to depend on the hex itself

[02-Dec-18 09:08 PM] Alright#0419
as the hex giving you error didn't give me an error

[02-Dec-18 09:09 PM] Alright#0419
the "HOLA!" hex worked for me on SPLTEST, trying a new pubkey now to see if it works a couple times then stops

[02-Dec-18 09:09 PM] SHossain#0007

what does `oraclesinfo 26fe59203720cfb061e51e2babd057b96f053e459471dd52afafe0ab1fe9d005` outputs?

[02-Dec-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810

[02-Dec-18 09:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there are more than enough datafee

[02-Dec-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
ok so on new pubkey, first oraclesdata worked

[02-Dec-18 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
then stack element error

[02-Dec-18 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers can you give the exact steps to @Mihailo including the chain repo and params?

[02-Dec-18 09:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hey guys, just to let you know. I think I'll be back on Tuseday so will take a look at this thing right away.

{Reactions}
üëçüèΩ (3) 

[02-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
I think problem is spending baton utxo from mempool

[02-Dec-18 09:16 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @Mihailo

[02-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
You can do 1 oraclesdata per block

[02-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Alright#0419
if you do more, stack element error

[02-Dec-18 09:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have not been able to do even one

[02-Dec-18 09:18 PM] Mihailo#5902
I had once the problem with data fee 0 is illegal but I've done changes to oracles then and thought the oracle was corrupt. This coupd probably be that it finds the wrong baton or as @Alright says when baton is spent in mempool

[02-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
any chance you could get this print `2018-12-02 21:20:29 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: ConnectInputs failed a387e70a5e618725862f8a07b3df0304a03035e279a54b2af733d1aa5830af67`
to show which input is failing

[02-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
1 per block even stopped working for me now, so that theory isn't a great one

[02-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
ok, so newly registered pubkey can send 2 or 3 oraclesdata

[02-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
then stack element error

[02-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Alright#0419
everyone after that

[03-Dec-18 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers worked on SPLTEST yup

[03-Dec-18 10:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, there is an issue that so far 3 of us have been able to reproduce

[03-Dec-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
@dimxy do you need help with gateways? if so @TonyL has a very useful TUI

[03-Dec-18 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers What is the sequence to repeat the problem?
I've tried this way: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2tYj2QD6bH/ on FSM and SPLTEST chain.
Have I try to broadcast `oraclesdata` multiply time or register few publishers? How many subscription UTXOs have I create?

[03-Dec-18 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy feel free to contact me if you'll need any guidance for gateway setup
Here you can find a step-by-step guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/gateways/scenarios/tutorial.html for 1 of 1 gateway which should help understand the flow

[03-Dec-18 11:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@TonyL create S oracle

[03-Dec-18 11:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Register 2 times with 10k sats

[03-Dec-18 11:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Subscribe 2 times with 1 coin

[03-Dec-18 11:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Then try oraclesdata

[03-Dec-18 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @siu - Chainmakers üëç  Let me try

[03-Dec-18 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm did everything exactly this way, not reproduced this issue: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YdZKtRCkrV/

[03-Dec-18 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Only issue I've noticed is that if I do registration with same datafee twice it's duplicating:

Hmm

[03-Dec-18 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Weird

[03-Dec-18 12:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Can you try multiple inputs?

[03-Dec-18 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Multiply = different?

[03-Dec-18 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I've tried to broadcast different data in the same block (used `ff`, `fff` and so on)
