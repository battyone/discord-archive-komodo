I'm just not familiar with CCNG

[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I saw it in the pinned messages, but didn't have time to explore it.

[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
it will work. but, if you have balance already in you address, you can't claim faucet funds. that is the rule

[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The output is a bit confusing:
```
siddhartha@aang:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAC faucetget
{
  "result": "success",
  "hex": "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"

[06-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It would appear that it successful send the 0.1 coins back to the faucet pubkey, correct?

[06-Oct-18 12:43 PM] SHossain#0007
you ddin't broadcast the `hex` using `sendrawtransaction`

[06-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, so we need to do that with each cc command?

[06-Oct-18 12:43 PM] SHossain#0007
each one of them. if you don't broadcast, no one will know

here is the faucet docs which is a good read before trying

[06-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Out of curiosity, why don't we just automate the sendrawtransaction part?

Yes, these are more stylistically inline with our previous documentation.

Yes, it seems like an unnecessary step.

[06-Oct-18 12:54 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't have any idea yet why they are how they are.  There might be times in the future when I want flexibility in broadcasting.

Taking a look at `tokens`

[06-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
once you get the basic workings understood, most all the CC are the same, with just details on what each CC does being different

[06-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
as to why i dont automatically broadcast is that it changes the state of the chain if you broadcast it

[06-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes. I'm just finding the Mastering Cryptoconditions docs, as well, which are also making it much easier.

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, gtk

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can duplicate a bug and then destroy it by auto-broadcasting

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
this also allows a gui to get user confirmation before sending the tx

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not hard to make a script to autoboradcast

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but impossible to not broadcast and autobroadcasting rpc

[06-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right

[06-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
rpc needs to do the least common denominator

[06-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, gtk

[06-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
else it becomes harder to combine. though in this case it is primarily for debug purpose and adding a "broadcast":1 flag is a possibility

[06-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I can add a non-debug mode where all CC are autobroadcast after that rpc call is set

[06-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is not very hard to deal with either way

[06-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right

[06-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Any ideas?

[06-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have any of the tokens?

[06-Oct-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant ask without having the token, you cant bid without any coins

[06-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I should...

[06-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm also trying to transfer a token, but finding this one difficult as well.

[06-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810

[06-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810

jl777 made most of the rpc calls easily understandable. all you have to do is, when you get a hex of raw transaction, you need to broadcast it

[06-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

block confirmation is another important thing

[06-Oct-18 02:56 PM] SHossain#0007
once, you broadcast any tx, until it confirms, balance may disappear or information may not show

what did you do before that?

[06-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did a few more transactions and mined them, and now it's registering.

[06-Oct-18 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
did you use `tokentransfer`?

[06-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
One `sendrawtransaction` wasn't enough to trigger a block, apparently.

[06-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[06-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[06-Oct-18 03:12 PM] SHossain#0007
they didn't disappear. they were just in unconfirmed state

[06-Oct-18 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
it is always good to use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=AAC getrawmempool` to see if the tx is in mempool or confirmed after broadcasting a tx.

[08-Oct-18 05:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Just started to test channels CC:
@Mihailo `channelsinfo` call allows get an information about channel like a:
```  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 800000000 satoshi - 33a0d659acde3caf7f9b81fd6e0621924365fe58a9fc7ce772a2c54d795f010a"
```

[08-Oct-18 05:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I've made one payment. It's still 10 payments. Is here any way to check how many payments left in channel?
Also how to get the information if channel is open or already closed?

[08-Oct-18 05:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Noticed that now is possible to create channel like this (with payment amount < tx fee):
```  "Channel": "RC3VHbSFQioJsu3xb3qPuEr9dSW3VqZhWj - 10 payments of 8 satoshi - 200013b8e0a770b359a46689e3b457a4ac0fe48f9586728726e6f697d70715ae",

What is creating not working "dead" channel: 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CCNG channelspayment 200013b8e0a770b359a46689e3b457a4ac0fe48f9586728726e6f697d70715ae 8
