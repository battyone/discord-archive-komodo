@Alright Yeah, it's a very deep matter. Identity and real-world connection / proofing questions aren't resolved yet, so only real usage for now are crowdsales 😂  But it's mostly because of tons limitations in Ethereum smarts as I think. UTXO CC's have to pump this party. 😃

Described some basic tested cases for Token CC in this list and reflected it's coverage in auto-tests
Tomorrow I'm going to fill the gaps in autotests and think on more exotic cases.

If anyone from community or team want to contribute - feel free to drop your test cases ideas in comments to doc, I'll check all of them and add to list the result.

[23-Aug-18 09:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL submit a PR for that, looks very nice. We don't want to create merge conflicts for each other 😃

i just spent a long time trying to stop and restart our daemon in Python tests, to get faucet tests working .... and it just don't work

[23-Aug-18 09:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
`wait_bitcoinds()` is supposed to wait for all your processes to exit cleanly, but it doesn't work

[23-Aug-18 09:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
you made lots of good changes, using my custom assert that I realized we needed 😃

[23-Aug-18 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Thanks for a feedback! Oh yeah, I've noticed you added very useful method but forgot to implement it 😃

[23-Aug-18 09:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
no, it's just that I wrote the method later on, I used it in a few places 😃

[23-Aug-18 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
To where have I PR?

[23-Aug-18 09:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a tiny PR to make the faucet tests pass

@TonyL yes, commenting them out in your PR is fine

[23-Aug-18 09:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
very cool to see others working on the Python tests!

[23-Aug-18 09:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
faucet stuff is really annoying to test right now, so i will probably focus on other stuff

[23-Aug-18 09:24 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a very wide space in dice betting to cover

[23-Aug-18 09:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
i would like to turn some of your manual tests into Python tests, maybe we can work on that together

[23-Aug-18 09:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
we need dice tests, there are almost none. I got stuck on faucet stuff a bit

[23-Aug-18 09:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Dicebet was a CC with most of the issues during the manual testing

[23-Aug-18 09:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
and i had to fight lots of test infrastructure bugs in making this a kmd test suite, versus the zcash one we inherited

[23-Aug-18 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, very cool will be work together on it. I'm definitely looking to get some experience in python test writing

[23-Aug-18 09:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
i was thinking, should we have cryptoconditions_dice.py, _faucet.py, etc...

[23-Aug-18 09:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you can run just the tests for that CC? I can see running 100 dice tests to check randomness/etc, and our 1 file will get very very slow

[23-Aug-18 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I though about such dividing for each CC as well. It will be easier to collaborate in such case

[23-Aug-18 09:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
also reduces potential of merge conflicts if people are working on different CC tests

[23-Aug-18 09:27 PM] TonyL#3577
This dice test was very specific. Goal was only check RNG

[23-Aug-18 09:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL your PR is much larger than the edits I have, so best for you to get a PR in, and I will integrate my faucet changes that make the tests pass

[23-Aug-18 09:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think it's very valuable to run some basic RNG tests, to make sure our dice contract doesn't have crazy improbable behavior

[23-Aug-18 09:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, just going thru the motions of the most common operations+contracts will find 80% of bugs

[23-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Alright#0419
Can someone help me understand `dicebet` a bit better please? When I do `dicebet` on a plan with a 1 block timeout, will a transaction always immediately follow it that spends it's outputs?

[23-Aug-18 09:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like a James question

[23-Aug-18 09:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL small issue

[23-Aug-18 09:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes

[23-Aug-18 09:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
you must have branched from dev or master

[23-Aug-18 09:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
when you submit to jl777, it messes stuff up

[23-Aug-18 09:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
best would be to branch from jl777 branch, cherry pick your commit or patch or whatever onto that

[23-Aug-18 09:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
then resubmit PR to the same jl777 branch you did

[23-Aug-18 09:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
you might be able to just send it to the dev branch, but I am not sure. James is doing a lot of work for the hardfork coming up and he might not be merging branches as often

[23-Aug-18 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
my `cctests` branch is a branch off of `jl777`

[23-Aug-18 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I submit PR's to jl777 branch

[23-Aug-18 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
then when James feels it's right, he merges jl777 branch to dev. The dev gets merged to master occasionally. so code flows from jl777 -> dev -> master

[23-Aug-18 09:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a beta branch in there too 😃

[23-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419
between master and dev

[23-Aug-18 09:34 PM] xRobeSx#5136
we used to use beta as more stable as dev 😃 not much recently

[23-Aug-18 09:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
jl777 -> dev -> beta -> master

[23-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Alright#0419

When I was just a boy, I used master. Then when I became a notary I started using dev. Now I live on jl777 branch

[23-Aug-18 09:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL if you create a new branch from jl777 branch, then cherry-pick the commit id(s) from your code, that is one way to do it

[23-Aug-18 09:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you had a lot of commits, then sometimes just a diff/patch is easier

[23-Aug-18 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok give me few minutes to understand the flow :))

[23-Aug-18 09:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't expect merge conflicts, but you will see that your PR on github has a bajillion unrelated commits in it

[23-Aug-18 09:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
because of cross-branch merging confusion

[23-Aug-18 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
Ah i think i understand what is happening

[23-Aug-18 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
does `dicestatus` trigger sending a tx after timeout?

[23-Aug-18 09:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm

[23-Aug-18 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh it's a lot of code

[23-Aug-18 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
but also, yes, it seems to sendraw xtns sometimes

[23-Aug-18 09:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright it sends xtns in various circumstances

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i can't tell if it's based on timeouts tho. Not directly

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
but it could in some nested function

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if executed without pubkey

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just tokenid

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sorry, dice plan id

[23-Aug-18 09:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it can call dicebetfinish internally, and diceaddfunding

[23-Aug-18 09:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
and it creates + sends raw xtns in 2 or 3 different circumstances. timeoutblocks doesn't seem to be used tho

[23-Aug-18 09:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
a bare minimum goal is to have every CC RPC function tested at least once, not sure where we are with that

[23-Aug-18 09:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I've realised that in some illegal cases hex generating but error receiving on transaction broadcast stage. So `send_and_mine` is a must have tool ))

[23-Aug-18 09:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
👍

[23-Aug-18 09:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a way to test those exceptions, too

[23-Aug-18 09:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
```+        # try to broadcast the xtn, but we will get 'faucet is only for brand new addresses'
+        assert_raises(JSONRPCException, rpc.sendrawtransaction, [ result['hex'] ])
+
+        newaddr = rpc.getnewaddress()
+        assert newaddr, "got a new address"
+        result  = rpc.validateaddress(newaddr)
+        newpubkey = result['pubkey']
+        assert newpubkey, "got a pubkey for new address"```

[23-Aug-18 09:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
will submit that once your PR is merged

[23-Aug-18 09:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
we could use some custom asserts that better test for valid hex and valid addresses, stuff like that
