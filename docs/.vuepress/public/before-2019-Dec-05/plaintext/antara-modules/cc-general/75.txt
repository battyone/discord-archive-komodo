@SHossain just tried to check your bet, but I didn't compile it from last today's source yet:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicestatus DiceX 9b9d0f0234d945929a1f41253eeb8a6ab39a6a837dfe09859840c664a8c7ecc6 c707dee2e4f66bca7b8a84ff71b9704f649dc56158429639e6f0cc4acd040468
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
```

[22-Aug-18 05:09 PM] SHossain#0007
please test from today's update. Dukeleto pushed some update today

[22-Aug-18 05:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to compile latest one and check again yep

Work as well

[22-Aug-18 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
strange

[22-Aug-18 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
i stopped the daemon, restarted with `-reindex` option and now getting this
```
    "result": {
        "result": "error",
        "error": "couldnt find bettx or entropytx"
    },
```

[22-Aug-18 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
placed a new bet and same with the txid i received

[22-Aug-18 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
do you mind to try compiling again with `make clean` and data dir cleaned up?

👌 

[22-Aug-18 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
leave the wallet.dat and BRK.conf file and delete other data

hi guys

[22-Aug-18 05:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can you take a look at this chain?

[22-Aug-18 05:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its a test of a fork from a non-cc chain to activated cc chain.

[22-Aug-18 05:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sync and  test

[22-Aug-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
need it use FSM branch for that one

[22-Aug-18 05:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh right

[22-Aug-18 05:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
FSM branch

[22-Aug-18 05:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @siu - Chainmakers I'll setup this build and chain after check this bet status issue

[22-Aug-18 05:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[22-Aug-18 05:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain I've totally deleted `~/.komodod`, rebuild from other directory from scratch but still able to get bet status. Let me try to place mine

[22-Aug-18 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain you should see a `couldnt find bettx or entropytx` in stderr and perhaps more information to help debug

[22-Aug-18 05:55 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain New bet to yours contract  was placed but cannot get it's status:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicestatus DiceX 9b9d0f0234d945929a1f41253eeb8a6ab39a6a837dfe09859840c664a8c7ecc6 9e760e4cf18b54de2084c000059cb95c941595e51e27f0ac64bacc8efe783cf9
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find dice entropy inputs"
}
```

[22-Aug-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
both of those are new errors that are not only printed to stderr, but also returned as JSON

[22-Aug-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
look at stderr to see more details

[22-Aug-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
"new" as in they haven't been in json results before

[22-Aug-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you can do getrawtransaction to verify your txid's

[22-Aug-18 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicestatus DiceX 9b9d0f0234d945929a1f41253eeb8a6ab39a6a837dfe09859840c664a8c7ecc6 9e760e4cf18b54de2084c000059cb95c941595e51e27f0ac64bacc8efe783cf9
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
```
But when I run daemon in previous build I'm able to get info about bet

[22-Aug-18 06:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So it should be a bug hmm. UPD re-switched daemon back and can get status. Maybe there is just some delay. But transaction wasnt in rawmemorypool already when I've received `can't find entropy inputs`

[22-Aug-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it only looks in confirmed tx for entropy

[22-Aug-18 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
the new error messages in dice results should help debug various edge cases in test plans

[22-Aug-18 06:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Now I'm receiving ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=BRK dicestatus DiceX 9b9d0f0234d945929a1f41253eeb8a6ab39a6a837dfe09859840c664a8c7ecc6 c707dee2e4f66bca7b8a84ff71b9704f649dc56158429639e6f0cc4acd040468
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "Diceinit error"
}
```
Same as @SHossain 
And in daemon logs
```Dice plan (DiceX) already exists cmpflag.1
Diceinit error
```
But actually I'm not trying to create a dice plan. I'm just trying to check status of my bet

[22-Aug-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so the latest version broke dicestatus?

[22-Aug-18 06:11 PM] TonyL#3577
And on same call in previous build right now I'm getting:
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
```
So yes, dicestatus looks broken @jl777c

[22-Aug-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed version with some debug prints. plz post console result

[22-Aug-18 06:19 PM] TonyL#3577

i placed a new bet and used the txid

[22-Aug-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i think (hope) latest version fixes this

[22-Aug-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810

if the check fundingtxid print didnt show in console, it was the wrong version and a git pull; make is needed

pushed fix

[22-Aug-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto I added a CCerror = ""; in ensure_CCrequirements

[22-Aug-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
basically it would have gotten stuck returning same CCerror after the first error

```
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt create dice bet transaction"
```
```
cant find enough inputs 1115445.59277016 note enough for 10.00000000
cant find dice input
```

[22-Aug-18 07:06 PM] SHossain#0007
`couldnt create dice bet transaction` is due to having 0 balance perhaps. and, the 2nd one due to minimum bet is 10

[22-Aug-18 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
changed message to: couldnt create dice bet transaction. make sure your address has funds
