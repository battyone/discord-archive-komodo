Still nothing in `importgatewayprocessed` but maybe it's for something else

In general it seems that both deposit and withdrawal of KMD on assetchain worked smooth in case of 1of1 GW

It not looks good that I get hex for 0.01 there, I wonder it's some edge case with calculations - I deposited 0.05 and withdrawn 0.05

There are no tokens - only coins

[19-Apr-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Apr-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, this is sidechain?

[19-Apr-19 06:13 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Apr-19 06:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, importgateway

[19-Apr-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if a sidechain, the coins are 1:1

Strange so that I was able to withdraw 3 times by 0.01 already:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=IMPORTGW importgatewaywithdraw e6c98b7a6a008e6fdca6f3605d65ec332514d569580cfe40f6c8dda4ce1a9063 KMD 03dd8fb8dbd2f6dfbb4bc903bea4f87127023665a7ad2246a84bfe11600ad37d96 0.01

https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RVACmXRgmVvN5FN4S5kBm12KXKog4SQHHU and GW deposit address still have 0.18 KMD balance

[19-Apr-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can withdraw up to 0.18 more

[19-Apr-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for sidechains, we will need to deposit extra coins to the msig address to compensate for whatever coins are used or got issued

[19-Apr-19 06:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
You can withdraw as much as you have coins and there is funds in deposit address.

[19-Apr-19 06:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
But you should not have more coins than deposited. Those starting coins should be in oracle publisher funds.

[19-Apr-19 07:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think I haven't made the check if there is enough funds in depodit address as in regular  gateway we have tokens released as they are deposited so it is 1:1 and here we have some additional coins so it could happen that there is withdraw of more than in deposit address but that should be checked if possible...

[19-Apr-19 07:57 PM] TonyL#3577
I think just something not good with mining node (I'm not able to subscribe on oracle from it with same error about normal inputs)
From not mining node generating transaction for any sum

[19-Apr-19 07:58 PM] TonyL#3577
But can also generate withdrawal transaction with amount more than gateway deposit address balance

[19-Apr-19 08:08 PM] Mihailo#5902
And minimg node have some balance?

[19-Apr-19 08:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it have

[19-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm

[19-Apr-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it's just too little

[19-Apr-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Because default reward is very little

[19-Apr-19 08:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Sorry for confusion as usual - everything seems to work fine 😃
Only problem which I can see for now is a possibility to generate withdraw tx with amount > than funds amount on gw deposit wallet

[19-Apr-19 08:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Can try to broadcast such tx to see what will happen

[20-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well usually users won't have more coins than imported, but I can see if I can make some check.

[22-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL, it is very difficult to check or trace how much there is in deposited address. Either I need to track how much it was deposited/withdrawn so every withdraw tx should keep the balance in opret for example, or there should be some connection with external daemon to check how much there is in deposited address.
Basically when it is set correctly, users will have only imported coins. Initial coins should be burnt or kept by the creator of chain so that they are not mixed with imported coins.

i guess only komodo chains have such handy things

[22-Apr-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
seems we need to rely on the 1:1 correlation between deposits, coins, withdraws

[22-Apr-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so adding a reserve to the multisig that matches whatever coins were needed to be created

[22-Apr-19 09:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, that would be a good way. Except for BTC :D, would'nt want to put 10BTC in reserve 😛

[22-Apr-19 09:41 AM] Mihailo#5902
Import tx is a free tx, right? No txfee?

[22-Apr-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
up to the consensus rules

[22-Apr-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
can burn whatever excess or deposit matching

[22-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep

[22-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
I'm thinking about people that will import coins, they do not have to have some coins in order to import as there is no fee?

[22-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if a zerofee doesnt work, we should make it work

[22-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, it was working so far. I'm just checking the logic.

[22-Apr-19 09:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
So when the setup of sidechain is done, all other coins should either be burnt or kept on a side or the deposit for them must be done.

[18-Jul-19 09:14 AM] Malti#3948
is this the cc channel for the fiat gateway to the dex?

[18-Jul-19 09:16 AM] Mihailo#5902
No. The gateways CC is for making a gateway from external chains like (BTC,KMD,LTC...) to a Komodo asset chain. You can deposit 1 BTC on Bitcoin blockchain, and get 1 BTCT token on asset chain.

Hi,
I'm looking into how to tokenize physical objects for trading with the goal of creating a testcase demo.  I'm stepping quite far out of my depth and would appreciate any help with the noob questions I'll have.

{Reactions}
🆒 

[31-Aug-19 12:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Here's the first,
Fungible or non-fungible?  In the (example) case where I wanted to tokenize my house.

[31-Aug-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
@CrisF do you have two fungible houses? :troll:

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Aug-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
just google "fungible" if you don't know what it means

[31-Aug-19 12:51 AM] Alright#0419
in the case of a house, if it's split over multiple tokens somehow, those tokens are "fungible" with each other

[31-Aug-19 12:52 AM] Alright#0419
if it's a single token, it's "non-fungible" as there is no other

[31-Aug-19 12:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I googled it.  
So it is the total asset that is non-fungible.

[31-Aug-19 12:55 AM] CrisF#3405
I was thinking of the case that I split the house into many tokens, like shares in the house.

[31-Aug-19 12:56 AM] CrisF#3405
(There's going to be really noob questions like these!)

[31-Aug-19 12:59 AM] Alright#0419
if there are 5 tokens to that represent 1/5 of a house each, those 5 tokens are fungible with each other

[31-Aug-19 01:01 AM] CrisF#3405
That's what I was thinking.  So I'm not sure whether to chose fungible or non-fungible when creating the token.

[31-Aug-19 01:01 AM] CrisF#3405
I would like the individual tokens to be fungible with each other.

[13-Oct-19 07:58 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Thank you for the documentation. I've already read it, and what I understood is that the gateways are based on multisig, i.e. that one can withdraw from a gateway only if the owner/owners of the gateway let him to. Have I understood right?

[13-Oct-19 11:55 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Correct, though you can set one up and be ins owner, and the validation process is handled by an oraclefeed automatically (which must be kept running) for both deposits and withdrawls. It can be tricky to get your head around, but there is a walkthrough on the dev docs site.

[15-Oct-19 04:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
@johnwhitestar Yes, gateway can be multisig but it also can be single signature. The point with multisig is to make the deposit and withdraw as decentralized as possible. The idea for some gateways that will be ran on KMD asset chains is that notary nodes (which are trusted as they do the dPoW) also run oraclefeed which is responsible for posting external chain block data and responsible for withdraws. For example it will be gateway with 7of15 signatures necessary for withdraw or even more.

[15-Oct-19 04:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
Single signature gateways is basically centralized as you are puting trust in one point that can become corrupted, and you are throwing away all the point of blockchain. But probably there will be cases for single sig gateways.

[15-Oct-19 06:20 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
@Mihailo I'm specifically interested in decentralized solution. I'm thinking to create "smart tokens" based on KMD for a currency I'm quite involved in. So that currency would acquire off-chain KMD CC functionality. For that reason I'd need a gateway from and into KMD for that currency. But of course if it's just me who guaranties that gateway it's doesn't look out serious. Can I use KMD notaries for that purpose then, right? So there are automated 15 signatures to guaranty withdrawals from the gateway, am I understanding it right?
