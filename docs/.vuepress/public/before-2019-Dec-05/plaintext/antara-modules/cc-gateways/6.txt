Is there a test-chain to try my ideas on it without polluting the main chain. Are there also other KMD based chains to be used for my purpose?

What are the costs involved if I use notaries to guaranty gateway withdrawals?

some "test coins" with dpow are on kmdlabs, @CrisF  is already playing with some of them

thank you @phm87  but is KMDlabs a kind of test net for KMD or it has its own test chain instead?

[15-Oct-19 07:04 PM] johnwhitestar#1227
@CrisF seems like we are following similar paths, maybe we should consider cooperating üôÇ

No, KMDLabs is not a testnet for KMD but some KMD stuff are tested on KMDLabs. In #kmdlabs channel, you'll have more details. LABS is the coin of KMDLabs, LABS is notarized on KMD and other chains tested at the moment are also notarized. It is possible to ask (and maybe pay a little sth) to add a new coin during a testing period. KMDLabs is for testing, not for long term dpow: there is the official NN network for this

About testnet, we can launch assetchains/smartchains easily for any random purposes

Hi guys,
Sorry for the slow reply.
Yes, I'm trying this out and have done some basic testing to learn how it works.
My interest in it is to gain knowledge to pass along to a project that has asked me about it.
I'm keen to test further.
Things are extremely busy here atm so I won't be able to get back to it until at least Friday (if I survive, haha)

I also have many ongoing things and projects so few availability

A Labs chain should a good simulation although the hard fork is coming at the end of the month. Any suggestions @Alright ‚òù  (re: johnwhitestar#1227 's question)

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Gateways CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!
