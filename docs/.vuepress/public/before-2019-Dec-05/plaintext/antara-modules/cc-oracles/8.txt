i'm getting an empty array with `oracleslist` every time.    do you need some evidence or can you replicate without it?

[18-May-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, missed this message. Are you on latest FSM @Mylo ?

[18-May-19 04:24 PM] Alright#0419
@Mihailo testing this now, could you make oraclessamples aware of oraclesdata still in the mempool please?

[18-May-19 04:25 PM] Alright#0419
the trollbox dapp relied on that, don't think it's possible to do with your changes

[18-May-19 04:28 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise, it seems to work as intended
oraclesinfo only ever shows a single entry for each publisher 
oraclessamples is able to fetch all samples regardless of baton situation

[18-May-19 04:29 PM] Alright#0419
Although I've found another underlying problem because of this. If a publisher was actually being paid to publish data, they can re-register with a higher data fee and empty the funds. I brought this up before though, not sure it needs fixing or what, just pointing out that it's possible

[18-May-19 04:30 PM] Alright#0419
it's not a huge "bug" as a publisher could just publish a bunch of garbage data with the lower data fee anyway, this just allows them to do it all at once

[18-May-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
I can oraclesregister using `-pubkey` for a pubkey i don't own, this changes the oraclesinfo output

[18-May-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
can make oraclessamples "disappear" kind of

[18-May-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems a bug

[18-May-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
Oh it changes datafee as well

[18-May-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
so someone else can register your pubkey with a different datafee then next oraclesdata you do, your node uses the datafee they set

[18-May-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
a worse bug, we need to require vin from the pubkey is spent for register

[18-May-19 06:41 PM] TonyL#3577
I checked such behaviour before latest oracle update (wanted to "hack" votes app) and it printed that address for my pubkey not in wallet on tx broadcast. So bug appeared after latest change it seems

[18-May-19 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
You could always register for a pubkey you didn't own. I remember testing this months ago and thinking it had no negative effect because you couldn't oraclessamples for a pubkey you didn't own

[18-May-19 06:59 PM] Alright#0419
not sure if it always changed baton address and baton txid for real publisher info in oraclesinfo though

[18-May-19 07:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think you're right and it worked like this before. Re-checked now on latest FSM https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/C5D38nMcKN/

Actually I think when I checked it first time I got error on oraclesdata call, not on register:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ORCTEST1 oraclesdata c2c3f84e8b3911dc34af29c5e80c3a73e2e6fcad08c64e4fb9825aaa48655d99 00000

{

  "error": "couldnt publish data with oracle txid"
}
``` 
and did not pay much attention that was able to broadcast oraclesregister for other pubkey

[18-May-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to do more than rpc error checks, needs to be a consensus change

[18-May-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
make it timestamp activated

[18-May-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so existing oracle registers wont break

[22-May-19 11:20 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright @TonyL Can you check the fix for oracles on my branch https://github.com/Mixa84/komodo/tree/oraclesfix
The fix consists of pubkey spoofing check so you can only register for pubkey you own. Before register now there is another tx - oraclefund, which funds pubkeys oracles CC address with 10k sat and then on register it spends that amount to pubkeys normal address ( so it is back to the user). Also I've added oraclessamples to show mempool data.

BTW, the I didn't check before but oraclessamples seem to show uncomplete data? I have Ihh format and one data loks like this `47db1400ed4ffb3b28f91f1ff182f8d9452810e8f8c1f816c34e80c8ea0f14fa000000007d5bdc6fc72f4f487542b68124551100b978d0d683b9e06a7b58a432bd6f701e` but in samples it show like this `1e706fbd32a4587b6ae0b983d6d078b90011552481b64275484f2fc76fdc5b7d`

[22-May-19 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
not sure about incomplete data, will check it out as well

[22-May-19 04:13 PM] Alright#0419
just getting to this, going to leave notes as I go 
oraclesfund rpc response is not json

[22-May-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
I'm confused how spending the funcid 'F' utxo is passing validation without 'F' being defined in the switch statement

[22-May-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
how many CC vins do 'F' tx have

[22-May-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
register spends the CC utxo from 'F'

[22-May-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
Ahhhh

[22-May-19 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
ok everything seems to work as expected, didn't test the timestamp activation, will do it tomorrow

[22-May-19 09:08 PM] TonyL#3577

[23-May-19 09:34 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright I haven't yet set the timestamp as we didn't agree when it is going to activate (or I missed it). I just put some timestamp that already passed so I could test.

[23-May-19 09:34 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c When should the timestamp for oracle fix be?

[23-May-19 09:35 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @Alright I don't have the problem with oraclesfund, what are the steps to reproduce?

[23-May-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810

@Mihailo it's not a problem with the actual functionality. It's just that it doesn't respond with a json

@Mihailo is it possible for oraclesregister to spend oraclesfund utxos from mempool?

[24-May-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419

Apologies if this seems overly pedantic, but should the capitalisation be consistent?
ie. with `address/Address` and `balance/Balance`

[24-May-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but to change it now will break all existing JSON parsingz

[24-May-19 10:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
fair enough, thought that might be an issue

[24-May-19 10:11 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Alright I can make it, just as long it does not create some incosistent state...

[24-May-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-consensus change, so just allowing the register to use the most recent utxo, like baton should be harmless

[24-May-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
happy to test if you do it

[24-May-19 10:20 AM] Alright#0419

does `OraclesCCTokensAddress` need a `OraclesCCTokensBalance` output?

[24-May-19 10:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, this one won't create problems as you are spending your inputs so we can make it to spend from mempool (I was thinking if something happens in reorg or something, but seems it will be safe)

[24-May-19 11:34 AM] Mihailo#5902

you can fund other people's pubkey, they can use these utxos to register

doesn't matter though

[24-May-19 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
doens't have any effect, it always spends the correct utxo

[24-May-19 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
because you need the key to spend it anyway

[24-May-19 11:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, the validation was not overkill as you need to spend your input but then you could set another pubkey for the vouts....

[24-May-19 11:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or maybe you are right.... ü§î

[24-May-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
the existing validation for register was solid enough I think

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
I tried for days to send a register to someone else's baton address

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
Validation for register was not existant, as register did not spend any CC vout

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
lol no worries, good work

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
But basically you could build the tx manually where you will register for somebody else! That's the thing

[24-May-19 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
hmm no, I was trying to send oraclessamples to someone else's baton address

[24-May-19 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
baton violation üòõ

[24-May-19 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
that's a good check

[24-May-19 11:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(cp->evalcode,txfee,batonpk));
If you create a tx manually (without RPC) that sends this vout to someone else baton, but for this you need to have his private key so basically not possible.

[24-May-19 11:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
The thing is that validation will prevent for some inconsistency in opret!

[24-May-19 11:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
If you use RPC everything will be fine, and if you manually try to create, it will prevent that you put worng pubkey in opret, which could potentially make some problem in future!

[24-May-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
yea I found that oracletxid in op_return didn't really do anything?

[24-May-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
is that expected?

[24-May-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
I can change it and it has no effect, everything works as normal

[24-May-19 11:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
oracletxid in opret should point to which oracle that tx belongs. For example now when I add oraclefund inputs in register I match by oracletxid from opret!

[24-May-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
yes what I'm saying is that I can oraclesfund to someone else's pubkey with a garbage oracletxid in op_return

[24-May-19 11:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
In oracledata if you put wrong  oracletxid it probably won't add another oracledata...

[24-May-19 11:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
```cpp
if (funcid=='D' && DecodeOraclesData(vintx.vout[numvouts].scriptPubKey,tmporacletxid,tmpbatontxid,tmppk,data)==0)
                    fprintf(stderr,"invalid oraclesdata transaction \n");
                else if (tmporacletxid==oracletxid)
                {  ```

[24-May-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
then when they oraclesregister, they spend it, but it doesn't have any negative effect from what I can tell

[24-May-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
the only thing I could think of that would break it is is I could send garbage to the CC address and register try to spend this garbage and fail

[24-May-19 12:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
I think not, if you add garbage oracletxid in oraclesfund, it won't work for oraclesregister

[24-May-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
couldn't do it

[24-May-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
it does
