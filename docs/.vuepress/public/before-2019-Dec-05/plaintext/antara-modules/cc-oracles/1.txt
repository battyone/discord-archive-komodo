Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

I'm reposting some useful info. @jl777c stated that the Oracles CC makes the KV functionality obsolete. There was a convo in #talk-general about possibly using KV for a simple messaging platform that could be picked up by any wallets/dexs. @PTYX @Alright @Deleted User @kimmel (Pungo.io) @blackjok3r

[16-Sep-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
the POC we did wasn't secure *at all*

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
but a trollbox really doesn't need to be

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright stated he and someone else have created one before with KV; and that the messages could be read as soon as they were in the mempool

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
you could impersonate people for example

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah thats what i was thinking....something trollbox-y

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jspook16#3059
by using the same key?

[16-Sep-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant impersonate pubkey

[16-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jspook16#3059
I was thinking the pubkey would be the key we'd use

[16-Sep-18 08:15 PM] jspook16#3059
at least for integration in agama or komodo related wallets/dexes

[16-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
if you start a chain for it, I'll show you how we were doing it sometime this week

[16-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
make the chain worthless, giant block rewards

[16-Sep-18 08:18 PM] jspook16#3059
I've got LIZ (Lizzie) running.....

[16-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
there use to be prints in the stdout when KV transactions hit your node's mempool, we were grepping those

[16-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
it shows the full value

[16-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
will have to put those prints back in or something similar

[16-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jspook16#3059
oh i see....im gonna do some testing, see if can replicate

[16-Sep-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[16-Sep-18 08:26 PM] jspook16#3059
so the message isnt really coming from the asset chain right? it sounds like the backend could be tweaked to send from anywhere......it just wouldnt be documented in the chain

[16-Sep-18 08:26 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright

[16-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
not sure I understand what you mean

[16-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
the message is in the OP_RETURN of a transaction

[16-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
and you can read that message as soon as that transaction enters your mempool

[16-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
which is relatively quickly, would be plenty fast for a trollbox

[16-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Alright#0419
so you can read a message from someone and reply back and forth without any of the transactions being confirmed yet

[16-Sep-18 08:30 PM] jspook16#3059
so I understand that part..... did you use a server to get the "message" broadcast?

[16-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Alright#0419
you just use a normal komodod node for both receiving and sending messages

[16-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Alright#0419
then a script to grep those prints from stdout

[16-Sep-18 08:32 PM] jspook16#3059
I see the stdout where I create the kvupdate. I dont see the stdout on what would be the receiving side

[16-Sep-18 08:33 PM] jspook16#3059
or maybe im not following that part

[16-Sep-18 08:40 PM] jspook16#3059
Im gonna play around with it. If i can get something working ill look into seeing if oracles cc would be better suited

[16-Sep-18 09:13 PM] jspook16#3059
I tried enabling mempool in -debug options (receiving end), no joy

[16-Sep-18 09:30 PM] jspook16#3059
so close lol....i can get the transaction from mempool but i cant get the info where the message would be

[16-Sep-18 09:30 PM] jspook16#3059
i need mempool training..

[16-Sep-18 09:41 PM] jspook16#3059
..and im not on the latest branch that has cc enabled so i cant really test oracles yet. But i think that would present the same problem...the delay for the block to confirm

[16-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's a good usecase for KV still

[16-Sep-18 10:02 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah i think so i just can extract the payload from mempool on the receiving end

[16-Sep-18 10:03 PM] jspook16#3059
i see the transaction, i can decode it but it doesnt have the KV in it

[16-Sep-18 10:04 PM] jspook16#3059
maybe im looking in the wrong place. can i get op_return from a transaction in mempool?

uncomment those prints and rebuild

[16-Sep-18 10:05 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh ok. That will print it out in stdout right?

[16-Sep-18 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
all 3 of them

[16-Sep-18 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[16-Sep-18 10:06 PM] jspook16#3059
dude thank you

[16-Sep-18 10:56 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright I made the changes but i still dont see it show up on the stdout of the receiveing side. I'll keep poking around. Thanks

[16-Sep-18 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, maybe they are the wrong prints

[16-Sep-18 10:57 PM] Alright#0419
can you show me what it is printing please

[16-Sep-18 11:00 PM] jspook16#3059
umm how do i paste a screen shot? lol

[16-Sep-18 11:03 PM] jspook16#3059
i may not have those privileges..

[16-Sep-18 11:05 PM] jspook16#3059
I can see the stdout on the side where kvupdate is done. However nothing happens on the other komodo instance where I would be "receiving"

[16-Sep-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
you'd need to upload the screen shot elsewhere and post a link

[16-Sep-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
just copy and paste it between 3 back tics

[16-Sep-18 11:10 PM] Alright#0419
```
like this
```

[16-Sep-18 11:13 PM] jspook16#3059
i pm'ed it

[16-Sep-18 11:13 PM] jspook16#3059
thats the image on the sending side which i would expect to also how up on the node that would be the receiving side but nothing shows up on the receiving end

[16-Sep-18 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
oh uhh

[16-Sep-18 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
the stdout in the terminal windows where you started the daemon

[16-Sep-18 11:14 PM] Alright#0419
pipe that to a file then you can grep that file

[16-Sep-18 11:14 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah thats the same windown...im running it in the background

[16-Sep-18 11:15 PM] Alright#0419
don't start it with & at the end or whatever the equivalent is on windows

[16-Sep-18 11:15 PM] Alright#0419
the terminal window you run komodod.exe from should be giving you the prints

[16-Sep-18 11:15 PM] jspook16#3059
ok let me restart it without &

[16-Sep-18 11:54 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok so just posting some info: I was unable to get stdout working for KV so at the moment i cant retrieve the message before the block is mined (meaning about 1 min delay). I will continue to see if I can re-enable KV stdout (in the long run this may not be the best solution) and I will also see if there is a way to retrieve the message from the mempool manually (which there has to be since it was enabled in stdout at one point)

[17-Sep-18 12:20 AM] jspook16#3059
A little more info. I am able to retrieve the txid from mempool and get op_return with getrawtransaction. I can see the message in there (in hex). .... just need to figure out if its always in the same place or what to look for when retrieving just the message portion.

[17-Sep-18 12:37 AM] jspook16#3059
or i may be doing this the hard way....possibly I could use something else to get the message portion

[17-Sep-18 12:37 AM] jspook16#3059
but there is hope

[17-Sep-18 12:55 AM] Alright#0419
grepping the old prints was really simple

[17-Sep-18 12:55 AM] Alright#0419
definitely a better way to do that, but checking every single tx as it enters the mempool with getrawtransaction doesn't seem much better

[17-Sep-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we can find the prints, I can make it pipe those directly to a file like I did with iguana for failed notarizations logs

[17-Sep-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then the troll box can just tail the file every few seconds

[17-Sep-18 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems quite a simple solution

[17-Sep-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jaut add`-ac_troll` parameter to AC parameters to activate it.

[17-Sep-18 02:07 AM] jspook16#3059
Do I have to rebuild?

[17-Sep-18 02:08 AM] jspook16#3059
By the way thanks for chiming in.

[17-Sep-18 03:13 AM] jspook16#3059
I will work on this during the week

[17-Sep-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say I would need to fork komodo at first to a new branch

[17-Sep-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will ahve a go at this in a little while, if I can find the correct prints.

[17-Sep-18 03:34 AM] jspook16#3059
If you do, can you pin a message with the link. I may not get back for a couple days

[17-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 were they the correct prints?

[17-Sep-18 08:58 PM] jspook16#3059
I tried the last ones you sent me but they didn't work either.

[18-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
sorry @jspook16 I'll take a look today

[18-Sep-18 04:03 PM] Alright#0419
tag me if you respond btw, would have found it for you yesterday, but I just saw that message

[23-Sep-18 03:01 AM] jspook16#3059
@Alright if you get a chance to look for this. I've skimmed a bit but i can't tell what is what yet

[23-Sep-18 03:01 AM] jspook16#3059
I should have at least a half day tomorrow to get this going

[28-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's just amzing that on all KMD fields working very well and there will be progress in future...keep up

[29-Sep-18 01:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User  Its not that hard to make something work well, when you take all the bugs out 😉

going back to KV thing, I have read once CC stuff but I think my mind is yet not prepared for such complex information xd

[14-Oct-18 05:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
Im trying to workout a kind of delegated identity verification which doesnt exposes the user docs to services but user is able to offer a proof of his identity via KV/ipfs scheme. Pretty basic, I dont like complicated stuff

[14-Oct-18 05:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
also for notary services I think KV thing can get practical... let me draw a basic scheme

[14-Oct-18 06:28 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm said nothing I guess same can be achieved by simple text into a tx signature
