Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

the subscriber made a payment

[22-Mar-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that discloses their pubkey

[22-Mar-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what the problem is

[22-Mar-19 02:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
website:
- seller post data.
- without knowing any info of the buyers.
- buyer pays, and gets the data.

In case of website:
- the buyer doesn't has to always be present.
- don't have to re-post the data again. But I guess this point is not true exactly, in case the inventory is all sold, and then seller has to update it. But if it's just some digital data bytes, it is a one time task for seller.

The same model does not apply to Blockchain as I understood.
- Seller has to know the buyer's info. prior to posting the data to sell. Like `pubkey`
- Seller posts the encrypted data. Only the buyers who's pubkey was known to buyer can decrypt the data.
- Another set of buyers wait for the seller to post the data again to get the same data posted by the seller so they can decrypt it.

[22-Mar-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are encrypting each copy, then you cant publish until somebody pays and you can get their pubkey from the payment

[22-Mar-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
buyer pays oracle, publisher encrypts data to the buyer and collects the datafee

[22-Mar-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
you are making it a LOT more complex

[22-Mar-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be literally transactional and noninteractive

[22-Mar-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
buyer pays

[22-Mar-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
by paying buyer spends funds and reveals his pubkey

[22-Mar-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
seller sees the payment and to collect the funds must publish, so extracts the buyers pubkey and encrypts, publishes and collects datafee

[22-Mar-19 02:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, these steps are clear, thanks for making more clearer üôÇ

[22-Mar-19 02:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so in website it's initiator is Seller, were in blockchain it's the Buyer.

[22-Mar-19 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or I miss something in between again I guess

[22-Mar-19 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
How does seller post what data he/she's selling?

[22-Mar-19 02:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just need to test the oraclesCC for once üò¶

Hey all! I'm the project manager for hempcoin now, my interest is using the blockchain to help farmers track their data more efficiently. I am teaching myself coding to be of assistance to the community, alright mentioned that oracles were the way to demonstrate this action.

My question is, how can i be of service to you and the community to help facilitate THC to be able to track this data for our users?

[09-Apr-19 12:55 AM] Exile13#4458
Is this request something I would have to create on my own after forking from kmd? Or is it a part of the code that can be manipulated beforehand?

[09-Apr-19 01:04 AM] Exile13#4458
i guess forking may be the incorrect term

Am I understand correct that you want to send data from GPS and store it in oracle / get it from it?
If yes - @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is the biggest expert on this matter because he have experience of GPS tracking connection with OraclesCC in his dragonhound project where he tracking his dog. (in general any dog tracking is possible as I understand but his dog is like a QA üòÉ )

@Alright Reproduced this issue with oraclessamples on jl777: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/K7R8rxsXj2/ (wrote some comments between steps)

[10-May-19 08:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually its breaking when you register second time. I think it was there for a long time, just additional indicator such as txid and `0` param which allows to check all samples making tracking easier

[10-May-19 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Used other txfee: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/q8hwmbghMX/ so I think issue now isolated. Problem is that on each new oraclesregister creating new publisher and batontxid in oraclesinfo changing to this oraclesregister txid and previous samples "losing" because oraclessamples for this baton return nothing

[10-May-19 08:43 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @Alright I'll get on it right now.

{Reactions}
üôå 

[10-May-19 08:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @Alright The thing is that when you register it is creating new baton and not connecting to existing one so there is no way to find previous samples. But I'm not sure if it is supposed to work like that... And the bug can be that when you do oraclesinfo it shows you two registers with same baton, there it should show baton for each register and then you can get samples for one or the other... As there could be data that publisher wants to publish at different cost so he could do both. @jl777c ???

[10-May-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
According to "Mastering cryptoconditions" there was such idea initially:
```A data publisher needs to register a datafee and their pubkey for a specific oracletxid. datafee needs to be at least as big as a txfee. Using oraclesregister the current datafee can be updated so a publisher can adapt to market conditions.```

[10-May-19 08:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
It is just a question if there should be both datafees or only one at the time.

[10-May-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
So register just should overwrite datafee, not sure if path to previous data should be lost - I wonder only datafee need to adjust on next registers after first one

[10-May-19 08:51 AM] Mihailo#5902
If only one is current, then when doing second register previous baton should be connected. If both are active than each needs to have its own baton.

[10-May-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
And in oraclesinfo should be overwriting of publisher entry rather than appending.
Because actually `oraclesdata` not allows you to choose between different datafee publishers or something like that - it have only oracletxid and datahex as params. So from it follows that by design each pubkey should have only single publisher in oracle - not multiple

[10-May-19 08:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, lets see what @jl777c had in mind.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[10-May-19 09:10 AM] Mihailo#5902
Another thing is that oraclessamples is made in that way that it is looking just for oraclesdata txs. So when it reaches register it will stop there....

[10-May-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
I do think this was introduced after the inception of oracles CC
