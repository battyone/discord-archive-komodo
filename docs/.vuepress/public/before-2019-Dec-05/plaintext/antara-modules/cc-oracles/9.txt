The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

No, but I changed something else that could affect it!

[24-May-19 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
I need to try it again, I was really just testing that it worked as expected with no HAX

[24-May-19 12:01 PM] Alright#0419

I keep getting this error running test on oracle RPCs
```CC Eval EVAL_ORACLES Invalid: vin.3 is CC for oraclesregister or pubkey not same as vin pubkey, register must be done from owner of pubkey that registers to oracle!! spending tx e0915b54b98a1a0d8386ea1df90cc36cae14ae20c73332f960724964f415d563

its in a loop for each format string 
`valid_formats = ["s", "S", "d", "D", "c", "C", "t", "T", "i", "I", "l", "L", "h", "Ihh"]`
normally gets about halfway through, so pubkey is correct. Doesnt crash consistently on any specific format, but tends to get to at least "i"

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Can you try to do the same manually?  There was strange behaviour of tests on channelsCC (you can find in #cc-channels) not reproducable on usual chain, so I'm started to sync there is some regtest specifics.

[25-May-19 02:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I"m assuming it's trying to spend a utxo that was already used for an earlier tx. will try adding some sleeps or reflowing the loops

[25-May-19 05:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
loop reflow seems to have resolved the issue

[25-May-19 06:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
anyone able to offer a short desciption of these items and their purpose from `oraclesaddress`?
`| OraclesNormalAddress |`
`| OraclesNormalBalance | `
`| OraclesCCTokensAddress |`

[25-May-19 07:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
got tests completing, but `Ihh` output isnt what I'd expect. 
```
        # Ihh type
        result = rpc.oraclesdata(globals()["oracle_{}".format("Ihh")], "ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff")

        oraclesdata_Ihh = self.send_and_mine(result["hex"], rpc)
        info = rpc.oraclesinfo(globals()["oracle_{}".format("Ihh")])
        batonaddr = info['registered'][0]['baton']
        result = rpc.oraclessamples(globals()["oracle_{}".format("Ihh")], batonaddr, "1")

[25-May-19 07:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
original `assert_equal` has 3 items, output only gves the second one

[25-May-19 07:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

please don't change expected results in tests

[25-May-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
if output not match expected result it means that error is somewhere

[25-May-19 07:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
kept the old one commented out, just to see if it's work without the other bits

[25-May-19 07:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also has to remove the `u` before output, but was gonna work towards letting it back in

[25-May-19 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
If tests will do only what program say there is no any reasons in tests at all

[25-May-19 07:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Moreover Mihailo reported about similar issue with Ihh type above, maybe there is a problem with types combining

[25-May-19 07:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool. Does the `u` matter for `assert_equal`?
Had to change oraclessamples code, because didnt like using batontxis, looks like it wants baton address now.

[25-May-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577
oraclessamples output changed so maybe it return not unicode now

[25-May-19 07:45 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, wont work on retoring the `u` then

{Reactions}
üëç 

[25-May-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
before there was `u` because it returned unicode

[25-May-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Please keep in mind that end goal is not to make tests pass but to use tests to find problems in software

[25-May-19 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
So if program output not matches expected logical output - maybe problem is not in test condition but in program

[25-May-19 07:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
lol, yeah.

[25-May-19 07:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[25-May-19 07:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I changed loop to get past the `bad pubkey` error. Suspect issue is allocated utxo spent before loop got to it - so error message assumed misleading, because pubkey is correct.

[25-May-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
So if Ihh returning now except of this:
```#assert_equal("['4294967295', 'ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000', 'ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000']"``` 
this ```assert_equal("ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000ffffffff00000000", str(result["samples"][0]['data']), "Data match")```

[25-May-19 07:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Changed `oraclessamples` params to match what it wants now

[25-May-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
It's definetly a bug

[25-May-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Ihh should return I, h and h

[25-May-19 07:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
looks like only returning `h` ü§∑

[25-May-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the `bad pubkey` error was not always happening, and not on same format every time, so I think that is not bug in CC, just because of test script doing too much too quickly and trying to spend allocated utxos which already spent in earlier format loop.

[25-May-19 07:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
bug in error message being strange, but not in how CC works

[25-May-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, I think same problem was with channels - tests executed calls too fast

[26-May-19 06:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Curious about the `oraclesfund` RPC. Not yet in docs. 
Takes oracleTXID as single parameter. No "funds"?
Cant register until "funded". Value is not specified, but I did notice:
On oraclescreate, `OraclesNormalBalance` gains 0.001
On oraclesfund, `myCCbalance(Oracles)` gains 0.001 (repeatable)
I assume this is automatic and the value is static. Please confirm?

[26-May-19 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
oraclesfund sends a static amount to your CC address

[26-May-19 08:57 AM] Alright#0419
which oraclesregister will then spend

[26-May-19 08:58 AM] Alright#0419
purpose of doing that is to trigger CC validation on oraclesregister inputs from what I understand

[26-May-19 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
really don't think you should use regtest for unit tests btw

[26-May-19 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
I *really* don't trust that regtest has the same exact behavior as a real chain

[26-May-19 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
`-testnode=1` with a quick block time would be more suitable imo

[26-May-19 09:21 AM] gcharang#6833
and if you need two seperate wallets for testing,
you can use: https://github.com/gcharang/create-assetchain
for starting  a chain with two daemons on the same node

rest of site is down for updates tho

[26-May-19 04:18 PM] TonyL#3577
So, is there issue with combined datatypes? @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[26-May-19 10:58 PM] TonyL#3577
`you can use: https://github.com/gcharang/create-assetchain

Regtest framework doing quite same thing btw:
https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/blob/FSM/qa/rpc-tests/test_framework/test_framework.py#L202

It should be not very hard to switch to non-regtest chain, but tests will take much more time and will much harder to tests new tests  üòÉ

@TonyL still working on manual confirmation, but I believe so. Keep getting `

  "result": "error",
  "error": "data does not match length or content format specification"

[27-May-19 09:57 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @Alright @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator As I mentioned before, I noticed something is wrong with oraclessamples as the data for Ihh was too short, and seems it is just returning single hash
