Topic: This channel is for discussion and announcements surrounding the oracles crypto condition contract. Please feel free to answer any questions, technical or non-technical. The oracles contract can be used for converting off-chain data into on-chain data. It has vast set of use cases as dapps and other contracts can trigger actions based on what is written to an oracle. Please see the channel's pinned messages for examples of how it is currently being used. Alright#0419 will be happy to answer any questions you may have when they are available.

@jl777c what happens if someone does 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ACOIN oraclessubscribe 6d048262e4c9fd3211b720528f8b14f49340dd9f4f3d9210dcdc23c080e3cd1e 03336ca9db27cb6e882830e20dc525884e27dc94d557a5e68b972a5cbf9e8c62a8 50`
And there are 3 differnt oracle plans with different datafee for the same oracle by the same pubkey

[19-Dec-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the most recent datafee from a publisher for a specific oracle is the current price

[19-Dec-18 06:15 PM] gcharang#6833
Got it.

Hi,
We have a project just starting up in #kmdlabs involving oracles.
Logging for the upcoming Migration Stress Test.  Stats for the Labs cluster following that.
Anyone interested is welcome to join in.  Good chance to gain experience and it would be a big help.
Drop in and say Hi #kmdlabs and check out the project here: https://kmdlabs.cc/p/logging_stats_project

Hi @CrisF I'm making a separate simple TUI for oracles (most of the functionality was implemented in gateways TUI, so just split things mostly) and want to add support of files upload/download (as binary) and text publish/read.
If some automation of external data publishing on oracle needed - I'm glad to help and implement it in current TUI.
I'm very sorry, but not understood from pad you've shared what actually needs to be implemented

[02-Jan-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
That's awesome, thanks @TonyL !

[02-Jan-19 11:26 AM] CrisF#3405
We're just collecting ideas on what is needed at the moment.

[02-Jan-19 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll put it together and let you know.

[02-Jan-19 11:27 AM] CrisF#3405

@jl777c Could you please advise on what is valid data input for `D` oracle type?
I've tried:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY7 oraclesdata 5464ccf162a76ba4494cd7ba8a4c11f2be116ad957681692340b98c6cf3700ba 00010001```
But getting an empty sample:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY7 oraclessamples 5464ccf162a76ba4494cd7ba8a4c11f2be116ad957681692340b98c6cf3700ba 5b68267a8e0231dc7fd07008e307d9e364e4ca6c2b191848c630003c322f7551 5

}

[02-Jan-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Made a simple converter which converting file to binary: let's say text file with `Hello world!` text to ```1001000011001010110110001101100011011110010000001110111011011110111001001101100011001000010000100001010``` now idea is to put this binary into oracle somehow

[02-Jan-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
'D' of 0001 is 256 bytes

[02-Jan-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
since the total string is not right length it is ignored

[02-Jan-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
'd' would have a single byte datalen

[02-Jan-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
little endian

[02-Jan-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
I've tried also `10001000`

[02-Jan-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
have you tried 'd'

[02-Jan-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
`d` type is broken

[02-Jan-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if 'd' is broken, maybe 'D' is broken too?

[02-Jan-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
how is 'd' broken?

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
d and D use the same part of code to put data, just 'd' has one byte length at first byte, and 'D' uses 2 bytes.

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
So if D works then d works too üòâ

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
And same as 's' and 'S'

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Creating `d` type oracle to re-check issue

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
Have you put the length bytes prior to data?

[02-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
'd': [length][data]
'D': [length_LSB][length_MSB][data]

[02-Jan-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
But shouldn't length be 10 since it's little endian?

[02-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Mihailo#5902
I got 0 also but posted 0101 üòõ

[02-Jan-19 03:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh for little endian and big endian 1 is same

[02-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix, it isnt consensus changing

[02-Jan-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
just update and it should display correctly

[02-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
little endian is about bytes, the first byte is the with least weight and the second is with more weight than first one.

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
aabb will result in bbaa

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the output string construction was truncating the string at str[i] = 0

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of str[i<<1] = 0

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ah, I see it üòõ

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
in both S and D

[02-Jan-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
printing %02x, needs to be <<= 1

[02-Jan-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
's' is ok without doubling

Some times you need to issue build several times.

[02-Jan-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
when in double make clean and build.sh (multiple times) from ~/komodo

[02-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ha, now I have same error

[02-Jan-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
any build issues have nothing to do with the 'd'/'D' fix

[02-Jan-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
there has been a lot of changes so maybe a build.sh is needed

[02-Jan-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810

[02-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c @TonyL It seems that if you pass different length data then set in oraclesdata the oraclessamples just ignore it and display as empty. Should we maybe make a sane check for data length in oraclesdata?
Like this one should fail `komodo-cli -ac_name=MSIG oraclesdata 96ff722c057bdc5afeb918e8bf2a10a495b5427e08f7cce156e5bede04033b98 030111`

[02-Jan-19 03:26 PM] Mihailo#5902
As there are only two bytes supplied.

[02-Jan-19 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Shouldn't this one fail because 3 is not valid for binary?

[02-Jan-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
its hex, not binary

[02-Jan-19 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
oh

[02-Jan-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and more error checking is certainly needed

[02-Jan-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if we want to make it a consensus issue though as that will break existing usages

[02-Jan-19 03:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Validation will help a lot I think

[02-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Mihailo#5902
The length is hex, and also I'm not sure if there is data check to be binary so we could add it

[02-Jan-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
lets add more error checking to the rpc call

[02-Jan-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
that way it wont affect consensus, but practically speaking it achieves the goal

[02-Jan-19 03:29 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok
