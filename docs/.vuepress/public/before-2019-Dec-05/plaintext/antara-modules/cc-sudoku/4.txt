we are currently updating automake/libtools setup as aformentioned which is why i havent implemented those changes yet.

[01-Feb-19 03:30 AM] ca333#0118
@grewalsatinder can you ensure you have command-line-tools or xcode installed?

[01-Feb-19 03:30 AM] ca333#0118
i am getting gcc 6.5.0 and will try reproducing if so.

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes xcode command line installed

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```satinders-MBP-2:KomodoOcean satinder$ xcode-select

unless I'm checking something incorrect

[01-Feb-19 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
installing homebrew also installs xcode command line automatically as I know

[01-Feb-19 11:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i won!

[01-Feb-19 11:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is there a sudoku explorer?

@siu - Chainmakers you won the riddle? Someone just did I'm curious what the answer was

[02-Feb-19 12:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
O no, not the riddle. My father solved the  sudoku puzzle since he is a big sudoku fan

[02-Feb-19 12:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But after that i couldnt solve the privkey extraction part.

[02-Feb-19 12:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Never really even tried.

[02-Feb-19 12:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But i just started testing the chain and the game and it works really well

[02-Feb-19 12:07 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
Oh gotcha .

[02-Feb-19 12:38 PM] TonyL#3577
@siu - Chainmakers great üëç I guess it's Ubuntu. Did you use installation with deps (pip packages) or portable release?

[02-Feb-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i did the installation with pip

[02-Feb-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i had some issues with pip since i upgraded from 16.04 to 18.04 recently

[02-Feb-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but once i got that fixed, the app worked perfectly

[02-Feb-19 12:39 PM] TonyL#3577

Should work without any additional manipulations

[02-Feb-19 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
daemon still doesnt run in windows?

[02-Feb-19 02:44 PM] TonyL#3577
There is ongoing work /enhancement of building process to make it work with dynamic libs (cclib targeted separation of dynamic and static libs)

[02-Feb-19 02:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
awesome

[02-Feb-19 02:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
these cc libs for different languages are super needed

[02-Feb-19 02:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just noticed that there are no sudoku rpc calls in help

[02-Feb-19 02:59 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess there is no connection now between `help` and functions in cclib
Anyway it's not possible to play Sudoku via cli calls (at least fair) because of captcha protection

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
interesting

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Result checking needs 81 timestamps as arguments and 81 numbers cells state line

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
And it should be ordered

[02-Feb-19 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So GUI handling all this stuff

[02-Feb-19 03:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so this is a completely new type of cc

[02-Feb-19 03:01 PM] TonyL#3577
It using faucet concepts / functions partially as I understand but this captcha concept is not used anywhere else

[02-Feb-19 03:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wow

[02-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
And as for me this CC looks like a dAPP mostly since it have Sudoku generator embeed

[02-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
And kinda app which sorting captcha stuff

[02-Feb-19 03:02 PM] TonyL#3577
So besides of transactions logic there is non transactions logic in this CC as well

[02-Feb-19 03:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this opens the doors for so many new things

if i understand correctly sudoku.cc in cc folder is actually an old sudoku game... with parts of the code changed to interact with the blockchain?

[02-Feb-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i used existing sudoku code to make a sudoku enforced blockchain

Size is suspiciously less 3 times than Ubuntu portable so would be great if someone without pre-installed deps test :)

 @ca333 btw SUDOKU not syncing on beta branch so Windows is open question - tried to force cherry-pick last commits from beta-win to jl777/FSM and build but no luck

@TonyL thanks for the info. Have you tried launching just komodo on WIN to see if komodo net syncs/connects?

[14-Feb-19 09:19 AM] ca333#0118
lets try to find out if this is a sudoku related issue or general problem

[14-Feb-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 I've only tried to sync SUDOKU chain on OSX with beta branch komodod. It's stuck on some early block with error that I'm not in agreement with other peers. So I've rebuilt OSX on latest FSM and SUDOKU synced

[14-Feb-19 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On Windows not tried anything so far üòÉ  Let me try to build `beta_win` and check if it sync

[14-Feb-19 09:45 AM] ca333#0118

I guess beta branch don't have sudoku cclib yet - on MacOS I've got same error when tried to sync with komodod from beta branch, then rebuilt from `jl777/FSM` and it synced fine
