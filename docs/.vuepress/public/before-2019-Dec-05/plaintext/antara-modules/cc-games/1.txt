this is made by copying customcc.* and making a BUILD_GAMESCC #ifdefs

[22-Mar-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
right now there is just two rpc calls, rng and rngnext

[22-Mar-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
rng is passed in a blockhash and playerid (defaults to 0, max 254) and it returns the initial rng value (and last)
you can then call rngnext with the prior rng, up to maxrng times

 The idea is for a game to start with a near future blockhash, so the lobby gets players signed up until just prior to the designated height. then that blockhash can be used to create a stream of rngs.
 
 the same initial rng can be used for all players, if the identical starting condition is required. up to 255 different initial rng can be derived from a single blockhash. (Actually any number is possible, for simplicity rng rpc limits to 255).
 
 you will notice maxrngs and lastrng, the lastrng is the rng value that will happen after maxrng iterations of calling rngnext with the current rng. This allows making time based multiplayer games where all the nodes can validate all the other nodes rng, even without realtime synchronization of all user input events.
 
 Every time period, all players would set their rng value to the lastrng value. The only thing to be careful of is it not exceed the maxrng calls to rngnext in a single time period. otherwise the same set of rng numbers will be repeated.

im confused here

[22-Mar-19 01:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so this is like a multiplayer rogue? im not understanding this.

[22-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[22-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just generating a deterministic set of rng

[22-Mar-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
no game

[22-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
most all games need rng

[22-Mar-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh ok

[22-Mar-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so this is like a backend for building games

[22-Mar-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are a gamedev, likely this will be too complex to understand

[22-Mar-19 01:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, ok.

[22-Mar-19 01:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but good to know this exists

[22-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, abstracting the rogue techniques to generalize it so other games can be plugged into the same type of blockchaining

[22-Mar-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just born today, not full grown by any means

@Alright i got low level messages working, so now in realtime users will be committing to keystrokes prior to the keystrokes tx and in order to complete a bailout tx would need to get both confirmation from other nodes that they did commit to the keystrokes in realtime and also if anybody catches the bogus keystrokes, they can claim the bailout amount. dont have that logic yet, but that is the concept I am working toward

[22-Mar-19 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so some payment for attestors who attest that the keystrokes tx were realtime broadcast ahead of time and the ability for any contradictory keystroke to allow the claimant to get the gold/playerdata

[22-Mar-19 09:34 PM] jl777c#5810
once this works, no more keystrokes reorging (or even suppressing) as it will be timestamped and only allow for some small delay

[22-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
What do you mean by low level messages? A separate p2p network essentially?

[22-Mar-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i created a new p2p message the bitcoin protocol was doing called "events"

[22-Mar-19 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so it sends to 4 to 8 random peers

[22-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Alright#0419
Aha that is interesting 😀

[22-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Alright#0419
blockchain is a game server

[22-Mar-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
doing this inside gamescc to get it working in isolation, maybe it will create a plug-in enabled interface that rogue dapp plugs into

[22-Mar-19 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the blockchain as game server, lag is not bad on small networks

{Reactions}
🆒 (2) 

[22-Mar-19 09:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and even if it is 10 seconds, it is plenty fast for the purposes of validating pre-keystrokes tx events and to claim false keystrokes tx

[22-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
I want to explore 1 time use game chains. I think this would be perfect for them

[22-Mar-19 09:38 PM] Alright#0419
the ac_import=GATEWAY chain with block reward idea

[22-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Alright#0419
as soon as you transfer coins to it, you're immediately competing against everyone else who has coins on it for the block reward

[22-Mar-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a sidechain, funded with external coins and gameplay wins coins?

[22-Mar-19 09:41 PM] Alright#0419
Ah I explained it once before. It's a bit strange to explain. Basically, you'd deposit some KMD to the gateway, receive some of the temporary coin in return. The chain itself would emit additional coins. When you go to withdraw, the exchange rate to KMD would be based on how many coins were emitted while you had coins on it

[22-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
So like if 2 people deposit 10 KMD each and the chain is emitting 1 coin per minute, 10 minutes later there is 30 of the gateway chain, but only 20 real KMD that can be withdrawed

[22-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
you would be competing with the other person for these 10 coins

[22-Mar-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
and the exchange rate would be 2/3

[22-Mar-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
when you go back to KMD

[22-Mar-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
automated and variable exchange rate, so it starts worth 1:1 but it gets diluated based on chain emission

[22-Mar-19 09:43 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[22-Mar-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this would be a way to denominate gameplay in external currency

[22-Mar-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
post your buyins, then based on ingame performance you split up the buyins

[22-Mar-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a gateway

[22-Mar-19 10:13 PM] Alright#0419
The objective in that example would be to earn >5 of the coins emitted. The nodes running the gateway could be the one doing these keystrokes checks

[22-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine doing 10 players would be about the same amount of work as doing 2

[22-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
the gateway itself could run it as a business, take some %

[22-Mar-19 10:15 PM] jl777c#5810
I think for the attestation it could be a small number of special nodes, but for the disputing a keystrokes, that should be fully decentralized

[22-Mar-19 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
we just need to know that the keystrokes were being posted in realtime from the attestors

[22-Mar-19 10:16 PM] Alright#0419
Ah lol that just clicked

[22-Mar-19 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but all the nodes would need to validate what the attestors attest to, and the only way to do that trustlessly is if all nodes get the events

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
hmmm, attestors could simply attest that they were submitting any keystrokes at all maybe? If all attestors say "this node didn't play this game in realtime" is that not enough?

[22-Mar-19 10:18 PM] Alright#0419
I guess it comes down to how attestors are selected

[22-Mar-19 10:19 PM] Alright#0419
i'm confusing myself, need to sleep on it 💤

[22-Mar-19 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
does the network trust the attestors?

[22-Mar-19 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
really it should be something all nodes already know, just a few need to be part of the final tx to attest to it

[22-Mar-19 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
they arent segregated

[22-Mar-19 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
actually they will be integrated into the transactions

[22-Mar-19 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue is making sure user events are fully reported and without errors, if those two things are validated by the network, then it seems cheating is simply not possible

[22-Mar-19 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
using the "entire user events are replayed by the game engine" to determine the results method

[22-Mar-19 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and once cheating is not possible, then we can have money tournaments and know the winner won it with real gameplay (human or bot)

[26-Mar-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL its working much better. I was able to play a game after registering and then replaying it

[26-Mar-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
next step is to get a deterministic result and since there is no playerdata, maybe at that point it is close to done

[26-Mar-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it is sending out each keystroke to the network, though that data isnt being used much yet

[26-Mar-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the codebase is much simplified, so by handling game specific things like playerdata all that is needed is the changing of the rng to support a new game

[26-Mar-19 06:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Sounds great! Will test asap

[26-Mar-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
most important thing at first (other than not crashing) is if the game replay cc/tetris seed is identical
