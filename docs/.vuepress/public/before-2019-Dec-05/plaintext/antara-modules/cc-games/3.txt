Oh ok I see

[26-Mar-19 10:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Just thought it will looks more beatiful if it will collect from player buyin + txfee  😃
Rebuilding node which not on latest and will try to register too

[26-Mar-19 10:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Buyins field looks fine after second registration:
```  "numplayers": 2,
  "buyins": 0.19980000,
  "maxplayers": 2,
```

[26-Mar-19 10:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Played short game and made bailout from one node and highlander from other one

[26-Mar-19 10:37 PM] TonyL#3577
It seems that buyins were transferred in highlander:
```

[26-Mar-19 10:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Flags for players status changed correctly also in gameinfo

[26-Mar-19 10:38 PM] TonyL#3577
buyins field remained the same in gameinfo - but not sure if it should be 0 after succesful highlander
```  "buyins": 0.19980000,
  "maxplayers": 2,
  "buyin": 0.10000000,

[26-Mar-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Going to rest - tomorrow will make separate tetris TUI (have to adopt few places and not show not needed ones)

[27-Mar-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
I make makecclib to build all the .so files and dapps

[27-Mar-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
I also added support in games CC to support a different game. much easier to do it at the source level, so you just need to make game.c game.h game.cpp and change 2 #ifdefs to use the game.c and game.cpp, so each .so will have one game with this method

[27-Mar-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL I moved the game source code into games dir

[27-Mar-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
cc/makecclib should build all dapps and .so files

[27-Mar-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
All dapps with rogue included?

[27-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[27-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, rogue is not changes

[27-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
just the tetris and new games will be in games dir

[27-Mar-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Got it, so tetris and prices for now

[27-Mar-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and new games CC games should go in games dir

[27-Mar-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
build controlled by -DBUILD_<game>

[27-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm before `makecclib` built "sudoku" cclib. What is the way to build sudoku cclib (SudokuCC and Dilithium ) at the moment?

[27-Mar-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
fixed

[27-Mar-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm strange, used only makecclib in build.sh (and it built `tetris` dapp in cc/games)
But have rogue cclib
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=GTEST cclibinfo
{
  "result": "success",
  "CClib": "rogue",```

[27-Mar-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Deleted/cleaned everything and trying again

[27-Mar-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
```Linux

```
Oh it building rogue first

[27-Mar-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, anyway have only `rogue` methods in cclibinfo

[27-Mar-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, to make games cclib I have to execute `cc/makegames`
```{
  "result": "success",
  "CClib": "gamescc",
```

[27-Mar-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
So if I want to make rogue daemon - I have just run `makecclib`
If  I want games - `makecclib` + `makegames`

[27-Mar-19 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Lool, tetris warriors

[27-Mar-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
At the moment code for rogue is quite monolyth (not assumed when write that there will be more games with same RPC mechanics) - so just don't choose any player 😃

Only rogue not accepted progress when I've broadcasted such failed keystrokes manually - but now tetris accepted it

[27-Mar-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL maybe it makes sense to make a pull request for TUI into tui folders, ie. ~/komodo/src/cc/rogue/tui, cc/games/tetristui

[27-Mar-19 04:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Will do 👍

[27-Mar-19 04:51 PM] TonyL#3577
All TUIs using functions from same module `lib/tuilib.py` and also using `lib/logo.txt` as loading logo
Can I create some subfolder like a`tuilib` in `src/cc` or put these files to `src/cc` ?

[27-Mar-19 04:53 PM] TonyL#3577
In general this file just 91KB I can just create lib/tuilib.py inside each TUI folder - just will be harder to maintain

[27-Mar-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is better to make a komodo/src/tui folder with a subfolder for each variant and it can share tui/lib

Hmm interesting that before in game before `You finished with 9920 points on level 4.`
But now just 9400 on level 6 (level 6 means more lines I wonder).
Not sure how points calculating in game - maybe there is some bonus for combos

Aha, last keystroke zero baton issue (seems it's only issue we have so far) with print `FinalizeCCTx couldnt find 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

I think I can fix it from TUI side - will just search zero baton ones in keystrokes.log and rebroadcast (if there are few - I'll just make delay between broadcasts 20 seconds)

[28-Mar-19 08:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm in this game not last one have zero baton in log but next-to-last

[28-Mar-19 08:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Was able to broadcast this next-to-last keystroke but progress wasn't added (because it's not in order I wonder)

[29-Mar-19 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Setup tetris games blaster on my node - it'll keep amount of pending singpleplayer games >= 100

Changed TUI a little bit also - for tetris it choosing random game from pending list now (same approach as sudoku).

Tetris games much shorter and more dynamic than rogue - so trying to cut waitings as much as possible.
So now it waiting 2 times: until registration tx is mined and next block before bailout execution

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1364
Also removed warriors choice possibility and for tetris forcing registration without playertxid argument

CC Games is like a framework for games connecting with blockchain (abstracted mechanics which was initially implemented in rogue). At the moment working game on it is Tetris - bricks falling, lines filling - depends of you score you getting coins on bailout

for games that cant be played by AI, cheating can be prevented

[13-Jul-19 07:54 PM] rainbro7#4735
It would be interesting to have a captcha like mechanism built into gameplay to prevent ai. If a simple game like Tetris is created, people can still cheat. Also, im sure there is something better than captcha that can be used. I see blockchain games with crypto integrations as a breeding ground for AI players :(
