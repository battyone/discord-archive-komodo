Yes unibright is an innovative leader in the field.  They have PoC with more than one platform.

If I want to make some web GUI have I use an Electrum?  
I've read that JSON-RPC isn't safe to use for a web-apps

[08-Oct-18 10:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for CC GUI? I think the good start would be with native

[08-Oct-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the current apps like Agama and BarterDEX and HyperDEX are made using combination of Electron + Node.js + HTML/CSS/Js/ReactJs

[08-Oct-18 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Electron bundles these as a desktop app to be cross os compatible

[08-Oct-18 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right now I think Anything which is making some new users/testers let use CC is worth it

[08-Oct-18 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even TUI of yours is great @TonyL

[08-Oct-18 10:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have not done it but I believe if you sign the trx localy you can post it to an explorer or node that accepts such signed transactions.

[08-Oct-18 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
keep extending and expanding it

[08-Oct-18 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder yes, for CC - wanted to roll some dices

[08-Oct-18 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CHMEX yes, possible to make SPV based CC GUI apps since that's the logic basically, sending signed tx

[08-Oct-18 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL since you are good with python, maybe you can find something which can be used to GUI your python app ü§î

[08-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL lmk which API calls you want to make, i'll show you one solution.  i'll need to write them into the komodo-rpc-lib and then you proxy the request from browser to a node with CORS anywhere project running in front of.

[08-Oct-18 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo Ok, great! Atm I think it'll be just all dice CC calls such as a `dicelist` `diceinfo` `dicefund` `diceaddfunds` `dicebet` `dicefinish` `dicestatus`

[08-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Mylo#8306
ok dice, https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/blob/master/src/dice/index.js just needs params passed in.  not too much work.

but it is JS.  if you want to make equivalent py thing, we can test out how to do it in py.  using electrum has many advantages that the wallet devs will be able to tell you about, which i'm ignorant of because i like full node power üòÉ

[08-Oct-18 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
I know JS ~ on the same level as I knew Python 1 month ago (syntax, classes, methods and etc.)
Will be nice kickoff to enlarge the knowledge

[08-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - i'll prep some docs for setting up the env.
1.  docker net on local host to run two nodes to mine ACs on single machine
2. install CORS-anywhere
3. basic js in browser
@Bryan_Beus will be interested in this too.

ok - install docker on your machine if you haven't.   then do a `docker pull imylomylo/jl777-komodo-dev:latest` it's about a 2GB d/l .   i'll start from zero on a VPS for instructions.  in the meantime.

haha ok.
```
git clone https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-komodo-smartcontracts.git
cd docker-komodo-smartcontracts/src
make run
```
You'll be dropped into a container.
That repo üëÜ  has two directories.
 1.  src/  has the Makefile to simplify repetitive commands it's just docker commands.
 2. node/ directory.  this gets mounted at ~/.komodo inside the container.

Your username in the container is `user` and the password is `pass`.  You have sudo access so you can `sudo su -` and then look at network stuff like `ifconfig` or `netstat  -ptan` etc.

[08-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Mylo#8306
You can `screen -S kmd` and type `komodod &` and it will start in `regtest` mode because that is the setting in `~/.komodo/komodo.conf`.
`^a d` will detach from that session.   alternatively you can ssh to your container.
in `regtest` mode you can do stuff like `komodo-cli generate 5` and will mine 5 blocks.

Enough about regtest mode.

Kill the container by `exit` and you get dropped back to your shell.

To create your own AC (network), comment out `regtest=1` in node/komodo.conf  (if you start a KMD daemon now it will connect to mainnet).

What you want is your own network in docker.  The `Makefile` has a `make` target called `acnet`.  So now you can:  `make acnet` then `make runacnet` for 1 container.  Then do it again for another container on the same docker network `make acnet` <-- probably in another terminal window.

If you `sudo ifconfig` in each, you get their ip address.
SSH server is not started by default atm.  so in each you will need to `/etc/init.d/ssh start` and then you can ssh to their docker network addresses, something like `172.19.0.2` and `172.19.0.3` from memory will be the first addresses on DHCP range.

Create your AC in each of those.

Is it because I ran it under `root` ?

[09-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Mylo#8306
haha yes.   if you edit the makefile, anywhere you see `/home/${USER}` make it look like `/${USER}` if you must use full power-up mode.

[09-Oct-18 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see, thank you! @Mylo 
 `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`which is in all guides for Komodo compiling seems to use $HOME env variable instead of $USER for ./zcash-params downloading.
Maybe will be useful for some super compatibility (if user set some exotic homedir for example or lamer like I which to lazy to use not root in test environments)
```
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

@Mylo ```So now you can:  make acnet then make runacnet for 1 container.  Then do it again for another container on the same docker network make acnet <-- probably in another terminal window.```

For me for second one worked ` make runacnet` but not `make acnet` 

For second `make acnet` get an error:
```~/docker-komodo-smartcontracts/src$ make acnet

Error response from daemon: network with name acnet already exists

[10-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Mylo#8306
ok you know what this error is?
kmd is trying to get a lock on a directory that already has a lock on it.
so to get around this, you specify at komodod startup -datadir=~/.komodo/node2_ac (and maybe with -conf=~/.komodo/node2_ac/thefile.conf)
First mkdir ~/.komodo/node2_ac
Some things the daemon isn't ready for automatically fixing itself, so you need to know how to help it @TonyL  üòÉ

[10-Oct-18 06:22 AM] Mylo#8306
tl;dr; daemon  hasn't been written to run same AC twice (or more) on one shared volume.  so you need to pass in datadir

[10-Oct-18 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Didn't know it's possible to set datadir on daemon startup. Thanks!

[10-Oct-18 06:24 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah you get good tips when you do silly things like this from the core devs üòâ

[10-Oct-18 06:24 AM] Mylo#8306
other option are in komodod -help or --help

[10-Oct-18 06:27 AM] Mylo#8306
you might need to cp config file manually into the datadir, can't remember.

[10-Oct-18 06:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, was able to start daemon this way (created directory and config file). Btw it's not worked with non obsolete path. : 
```komodod -ac_name=DOCKER1 -ac_supply=1000 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=1 -datadir=/home/user/.komodo/node1 -conf=/home/user/.komodo/node1/komodo.conf -addnode=172.18.0.2```
