global batonid?

[02-Nov-18 04:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, when I switch room in rooms list changing param `active_room_id =`
And app every 0.5 seconds grabbing oraclesdata with depth 1 for the current batontxid
If batontxid is the same as previous it's not displaying message (not adding to array with messages actually)

[02-Nov-18 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
For multiply people conversation I have to grab it for all publishers in room, correct?

[02-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
yep

[02-Nov-18 04:10 PM] Alright#0419
the current receive script does that

[02-Nov-18 04:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so now I can talk with only one publisher

[02-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Alright#0419
have to consider that there may be dupes of pubkeys in oracleslist btw

[02-Nov-18 04:11 PM] Alright#0419
if a pubkey registers multiple times

[02-Nov-18 04:11 PM] TonyL#3577
As I remeber I've stucked when tried to implement trollbox `receive.py`

[02-Nov-18 04:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to re-check it to grab messages for all publishers and parse nickname

[02-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Alright#0419
can help you if you're stuck on something in particular

There is much stuff to do to make this chat GUI really useful. If someone want to collaborate and contribute - feel free to buzz me. I'll be glad to answer on questions regards current code and framework/libs used

[02-Dec-18 10:23 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Is there any Delphi developer? Can we make some GUI samples for Delphi developers?

[03-Dec-18 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
GUI samples of what @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner ?  

GUI samples in Delphi or GUI samples in any language for a Delphi programmer to understand what to do from Delphi (transposing from one sample Lang to Delphi)?

[03-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Mylo#8306
Latter is being worked on currently in JavaScript and python but not a priority at the current week with sapling update.

[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Mylo  Thanks very much. It was for using CC functionalities from a Delphi program. No need to hurry.

[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Mylo#8306
For now @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner get your dev to look at using this for Delphi https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6590956/communication-with-rpc-service-using-indy-http-client-and-superobject-delphi-htt but use port 7771 kmd instead of 8332 btc

If they can do a ‚Äògetinfo‚Äò all they‚Äôll need to do is understand the flow of a crypto condition

[04-Dec-18 01:32 PM] Mylo#8306
Eg this is the flow for creating a dice table for diceCC dealer https://github.com/imylomylo/use-case-markdown-skeleton/blob/master/use-case-dice-table-setup.md

[04-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Mylo#8306
And call the diceCC RPC calls instead of getinfo.
Eg here are my notes from @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator text interface scripts https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/32da17f537e2b74b36cadac6245c87b0

Thanks for asking, these are the initial steps for a developer we want to get started in 10mins, when it is published.  Delphi is quite the unusual request üòÄ

[28-Dec-18 06:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
any updates about how is it going for CC on electrum libs?

[02-Jan-19 03:37 PM] TonyL#3577
There is nothing specific for CC in deals with Electrums I think since just RPC calls using

[02-Jan-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think something similar to Ethereum's MetaMask extension might help to build a bridge between CCs and Webapps

[02-Jan-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL @siu - Chainmakers I'm not very familiar with electrum. Does it support just sending raw hex?

[02-Jan-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
or will it flip out if we try to use a cryptocondition vin/vout

[02-Jan-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a sendrawtransaction ability

[02-Jan-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but the problem is to be able to properly sign CC vout

[02-Jan-19 05:35 PM] Alright#0419
so signing the cc vins/vouts is the only major hurdle?

[02-Jan-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
I was going to start playing with python to see if I can't use an explorer API to build then send faucetgets as a proof of concept. If I'm able to get that working, will electrum "just work"

[02-Jan-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a properly signed tx, then sure it will work

@siu - Chainmakers can you help with setting up an electrum server for testing with cc s?

[05-Jan-19 12:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Sure

[08-Jan-19 03:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@jusoaresf please DM me regarding the electrum server.

[11-Jan-19 10:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was thinking if there can be someone who creates the HTML/CSS/Js or even just makes the UX part in tools like invision app
and that UX part can be adopted in the GUI application by community devs.

[11-Jan-19 10:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I am not good with UX, but as I'm reaching to create the UI part of tokens DEX, I wish to have some good UX for such UI

[11-Jan-19 10:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the UX part strategy doesn't need the backend at first, it is a strategic design and action flow of user inputs

[11-Jan-19 10:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if someone can do that for us, it will be great help

[11-Jan-19 10:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Meyse I see your KMDICE UI image, that looks really great

[11-Jan-19 10:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
would you be in interested to make the UX/UI for a Tokens DEX app ?

Is the token DEX app different than barterdex?

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, built a cool (or not so cool) GUI or even a TUI using  CCs, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and maybe inspire some people.

Here's my current PR for the 3rd party resource Docs page, feel free to check it out and let me know if I missed anything, or if you want to add something you've been working on, or even just threw together. Ideally I'd like to have a GUI or TUI for every CC, and if possible a proof of concept using the CC for something.
