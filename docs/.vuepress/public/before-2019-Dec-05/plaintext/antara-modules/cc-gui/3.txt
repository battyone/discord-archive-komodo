@Deleted User Should be my flow be a: fork this library, re-write code to be compatible with Komodo, write my rpc-lib in the same repo ?
Or have I to create new repo, import this library as a module and override classes with changes for Komodo as @patchkez adviced?
Confused a little bit regards this flow since never build something with 3rd party modules

what happened to remote TUI?  now it looks like i need a config file in my python dreams

[17-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
check what you're doing - looks like it's getting a lot more complex than just talking to RPC which just uses strings and numbers.

for instance, dumpprivkey using RPC returns a string. 

WIth pter todd's python library, wants to return a bitcoin.base58.CBase58Data or something i don't even want to know is compatible with some library i don't really want to maintain as a dApp developer.  https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/bitcoin/wallet.py#L237

I just want to talk RPC to komodo interface over network.   simple auth, function(params) returns simple data of strings and numbers.

remove the need to read a file, you just want to configure RPC "on the fly" because the different ACs that will want to use oracles etc.

Other projects don't have this "on the fly" talk to ACs, which you identified as a problem configuring for each AC.

That's my 2c.

Peercoin rpc only supports these methods https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin_rpc/blob/master/peercoin_rpc/peercoin_rpc.py so just expand on them for KMD RPC stuff.

Fork it and just put in your oractelist method.  it should work no dramas

[18-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can use komodo-cli to fetch the rpcport... Or you can read the .conf file to extract all needed data... I'm not so sure how easy it in in python but I have bash scripts where all I need to give it is the name of the ac... And everything works out of the boz

[18-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For a lot ofy stuff ATM, I'm using bash scripts to pass python scripts data or vice versa...

[18-Oct-18 01:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There seems to be no other simple wat to do it, and using already working code saves endless time.

[18-Oct-18 04:52 AM] Mylo#8306
yes simple wrapper to RPC in every language is preferable without reading a .conf file, just passing in user, pass, host:port.   it has less baggage than everything else for a 1st step of developer tools.

[18-Oct-18 05:10 AM] Mylo#8306
nothing.  just don't hard code the path to remain flexible.

[18-Oct-18 05:11 AM] Mylo#8306
is my request.  it will add unnecessary support questions

[18-Oct-18 05:12 AM] Mylo#8306
time wasted for developers if it needs to be in ~/.komodo/ACNAME/ACNAME.conf or equiv in other OSes

[18-Oct-18 05:12 AM] Mylo#8306
But for remote TUI, all is needed is pass in user/pass.

[18-Oct-18 05:15 AM] Mylo#8306
the dApp devs can store their credentials. dictating where to store a config file by hard-coding the location limits the flexibility.  a web developer does not have access to the file system, has to pass in config params.

[18-Oct-18 05:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If your using a devoplemt chain, why not have the RPC/USER pass passed to the daemon on start, and have it write those to the file intead of random ones ?

[18-Oct-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can use whatever you want, and know it will be correct

[26-Oct-18 09:45 AM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL @gcharang @Alright this was linked at the bottom of that npyscreen project in #cc-general http://urwid.org/tutorial/index.html
It looks like an easy port from current TUI to urwid based TUI ?

[26-Oct-18 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo Yeah, played with this one a little bit as well, for me it seems same complexity as npyscreen but less functionality

[26-Oct-18 04:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL hey mate, you made tokens contract test script too?

[26-Oct-18 04:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need your logic help for tokenlist and tokeninfo saving in tmp/cache so that I don't query tokenlist/tokeninfo muultiple times so frequently.

[26-Oct-18 04:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
know already what I need to do from last conversation. just want to take a look at existing work.

[26-Oct-18 04:34 PM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder Hey mate! https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py#L283 here are tokenCC auto-tests
In gateways TUI I've only used tokencreate and tokenlist to printout list on screen

Not sure how it'll be on JS but in python to save tokenlist to file is like a 
```
tokenlist = rpc.tokenlist()
with open(newfile, 'a') as file:
    for token in tokenlist
    file.writelines(token + "\n")
```

[26-Oct-18 04:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe store this file on server side with some updatable "tokens_amount" param?

[26-Oct-18 04:39 PM] TonyL#3577
And from client side you'll check every X minutes if tokens_amount on client side < than tokens_amount on server side
If it's differ server give to client needed amount of lines and you append it to cache - should work since tokenids ordered in tokenlist (new ones append to the end)

[26-Oct-18 04:40 PM] TonyL#3577
So user will need to get only additional lines, not whole file

[26-Oct-18 04:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
One quick suggestion I need is if I store and keep updated value of tokenlist in a  separate key, and each tokeninfo in a separate tokenhash as key

[26-Oct-18 04:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm jusing key/value db

[26-Oct-18 04:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can do two ways:
- query tokenlist > update key `tokenlist` with it's array.
 - loop query this tokenlist array and store the info as a object under each hash array in this existing key.
 like
```{
  "tokenlist": [
    {"hash1": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
    {"hash2": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
    {"hash3": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
  ]
}```

[26-Oct-18 04:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or just save each separately.

[26-Oct-18 04:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
```{
  "tokenlist": [
    "hash1",
    "hash2",
    "hash3"
  ]
}

{"hash1": "token_info_here"}

{"hash2": "token_info_here"}

{"hash3": "token_info_here"}```

[26-Oct-18 04:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
On second thought, I guess the second approach should be better ü§î

@grewalsatinder I guess more effective will be get tokeinfo for needed tokenid by demand. Hmm but depends of displaying logic for sure üòÉ

[26-Oct-18 07:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
üßê for that I have to rethink the UI display part

[26-Oct-18 07:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess a token subscription part will do  it

[26-Oct-18 07:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
User will search and subscribe to that token list

[26-Oct-18 07:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just like the old NXT days

[26-Oct-18 07:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The ideal way I wanted to see it was to display the list with name, supply etc in a pages table views

[26-Oct-18 07:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Click on the token and open further orders etc

[26-Oct-18 07:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
