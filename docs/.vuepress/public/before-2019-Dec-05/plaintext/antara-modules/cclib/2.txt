so i guess with such a mechanism, people can write CC contracts using JS and all during runtime

[10-Apr-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
the text.js file cant be a local file for consensus, so just need to push it through opreturns

[10-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Mylo#8306
freaking awesome.  nice work @Deleted User

[12-Apr-19 02:47 AM] Mylo#8306
yep, already browsing options and documentation to accelerate understanding to implement

[12-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Mylo#8306
i won't be deliverying any.  no time to to take on such a project with small market of cc devs atm.

[12-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Mylo#8306
need to concentrate on the training artefacts (docs/diagrams) first.

[16-May-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
to mine too, as there are no limits to what can be in it

@mrlynch how do you include a go program in a c++ program?

[21-May-19 01:12 AM] Mylo#8306
or c.

[21-May-19 01:12 AM] Mylo#8306
something like:
```
#include <mysql/mysql.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

then add to your gcc command

-I/usr/local/include/mysql -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
```
?

[21-May-19 01:14 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe i'm asking the wrong (exact!) question, but i'd like to be able to include golang inside  c/c++ and access the internals of komodo.

[21-May-19 01:14 AM] Mylo#8306
from go

[21-May-19 01:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
oh.. you mean a wrapper in go?

[21-May-19 01:18 AM] mrlynch#5735
@grewalsatinder is working on it ..checkout kmdgo in his repo

@mrlynch no not a go wrapper.

[21-May-19 01:19 AM] Mylo#8306
embed golang inside the kmd daemon.

[21-May-19 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
cclib is a dynamc library.

[21-May-19 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
we can pile anything into cclib.

[21-May-19 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
emmanuel is working on js runtime into cclib.   this way, a consensus rules can be written in js.

[21-May-19 01:21 AM] Mylo#8306
so by embedding golang into cclib, consensus rules can be written in go

[21-May-19 01:22 AM] Mylo#8306
hope that makes sense...e.g. cc-dice could be written in go, and other games like that.

[21-May-19 01:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
oh.. i don't know.. haven't reached that lvl yet

[21-May-19 01:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
you over estimate my abilities ðŸ˜‚

[21-May-19 01:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
still a guppy

[21-May-19 01:23 AM] Mylo#8306
haha ok - well...on your travels thru docs/interwebs, can you be mindful of it.   if can be done, i'll learn go ðŸ˜„

[21-May-19 01:24 AM] Mylo#8306
cheers

[21-May-19 01:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
i deffinitely will.. there are so many things i need/want to learn, it's easy to lose track of

[21-May-19 01:42 AM] Mylo#8306
something to test when more time.

[21-May-19 01:43 AM] Mylo#8306
does it both ways go->C and C->go

[21-May-19 01:43 AM] Mylo#8306
hard to tell if the data structures will be visible.

[21-May-19 01:49 AM] Mylo#8306
removed old link.  ^^ those comments relate to old link.
this one is more recent and uses structs of C

Calling C code from go | Karthik Karanth
A tutorial on how to call functions written in C from a go project

[21-May-19 01:49 AM] Mylo#8306
may be useful in the future.

[21-May-19 01:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes, I only looked at using C C++ in golang code
Cclib is a lib file, I guess we can call C funcs in Go code and make a cclib of our own
I don't know about calling go code from C cclib, but pretty sure its similar way.

[21-May-19 01:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will check on it
Thanks for giving me some short target to focus on

[13-Jun-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
could the code be put into a file to work around all the things that want to parse things using different escape rules?

[13-Jun-19 09:25 PM] dimxy#2587
I tried to parse both strings calling the parser directly from komodod
```
std::string str1 = "{\"method\": \"cclib\", \"params\": [\"func0\", \"17\", \"{\"key\": \"striiiiiing\"}\"]}";
std::string str2 = "{\"method\": \"cclib\", \"params\": [\"func0\", \"17\", {\"key\": \"striiiiiing\"}]}";
```
so the str1 could not be parsed and str2 was parsed okay. Seems the parser works correctly. It is somewhere else that requires quotes for objects

[14-Jun-19 09:16 AM] dimxy#2587
well, I found how to add the support for parsing VOBJ (with no quotes requirement) in the cclib rpc - made it in my repo.
I can do a PR. 
Are PRs accepted this time?

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[14-Jun-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
PR can be submitted, but until the update is done to master, code freeze is in effect

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] dimxy#2587
okay, not a critical issue...

[16-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Mylo#8306
If I wanted to add compression using a c library to data being stored in an oracle, how would I do it using cclib?

[16-Aug-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you would not need cclib for that, just compress the data before storing it in the oracle

[16-Aug-19 10:54 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok yes probably easier to put it in the client side application.
