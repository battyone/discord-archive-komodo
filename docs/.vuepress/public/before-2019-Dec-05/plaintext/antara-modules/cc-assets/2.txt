@dimxy 

When you're available, I would appreciate your help creating documentation for CC Assets. 

If you're curious to know what CC documentation looks like when finished, so as to get idea of what we need for this module, take a look at any of the modules here:

Thank you

[13-Mar-19 05:56 AM] dimxy#2587
Hello @Bryan_Beus 
I'm now finishing the documentation for the migration rpc.
And of course, I'll be happy to help you with the documentation for CC assets in the nearest time.

[13-Mar-19 10:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sounds great!

[13-Mar-19 10:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not familiar with the migration rpc. Is that something that we need to add to developers.komodoplatform.com ?

[14-Mar-19 03:37 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes this is a rpc for migration coins between chains. I believe it should be added to the developers doc.

[14-Mar-19 04:34 AM] gcharang#6833
I think they will go here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/dev/docs/basic-docs/komodo-api/crosschain.md @Bryan_Beus

not sure if it's a bug in the documentation or in the RPC call

`komodo-cli .... tokencreate TOKA 0.0001 "short description"` works

but using curl need to wrap the supply (number) in a string https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/b983a89e78cf65abe98a229c1267698a#error

(need to hide this photo, it's when i looked young pre-komodo üòõ )

[12-May-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
In python client I wrap supply by `"` as well
Should be a bug in documentation (RPC args should be a string - bug in the RPC should be if RPC arg is not string)

[12-May-19 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
I've ran into quite a few examples of this behavior

[12-May-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
never really thought about it, just worked around it when rpc tells me it expected a string

[12-May-19 03:30 PM] Alright#0419
not all args are strings

[12-May-19 03:35 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm about CCs calls, not sure about others - there was huge inconsistency on some point and if I remember correct James proposed/recommended to use everywhere strings

[12-May-19 03:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe some args where only int is expecting can accept int, not sure

[12-May-19 07:15 PM] dimxy#2587
I think this is because in this rpc call the rpc param client conversion feature in rpc/client.cpp is not used, so all params are considered as strings (and if needed, converted into numbers inside the rpc call. So for curl they are all strings).
As I can see most of our cc rpc calls do not use client conversion either. If they do we could pass number params as numbers. The methods that use this  are listed in client.cpp.
We may decide if we should use this conversion for all developers

[12-May-19 07:19 PM] dimxy#2587
Probably to make our docs consistent (where params are described as they are: number as numbers, strings as strings ) we should use the client conversion.

[13-May-19 02:39 AM] Mylo#8306
ah damn.  sounds a bit messy.  now i understand why @Bryan_Beus skipped the curl exampels for CC and stuck with the command line - CLI sounds like consistent behaviour to document.   curl commands - seem to be all strings.
this will be quite annoying for the RPC wrapper developers, but once the wrappers are written, GUI devs wont have a problem.

[13-May-19 02:41 AM] Mylo#8306
```
komodo-cli -regtest -ac_name=MYCOIN tokencreate TOKENF "0.0005" "token g"
```
this worked for me, using supply as a string for cli (& curl)

[13-May-19 02:42 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for your inputs üëç

[13-May-19 02:45 AM] Mylo#8306
does response in curl also come back with repeated "result" in json.  `{ "result": { "result": "success", "hex": "......."}` or are my early morning eyes deceiving me?

[13-May-19 03:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In the docs, we should use whatever a developer would want to use during production.

We used komodo-cli earlier, because with curl I kept running into bug issues and couldn't afford to wait. I believe dukeleto solved many, if not all, of the bugs I came across back then.

[13-May-19 03:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You guys tell me, is curl better than komodo-cli?

[13-May-19 03:28 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah curl for devs.   komodo-cli has done it's job for getting docs to where it is, but it's time curl took over üòÉ

[13-May-19 03:29 AM] Mylo#8306
a non-sidd question here:
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/tokens.html#tokenorders
what happened to `tokenorders` with no tokenid.    seems `tokenid` is required now.

[13-May-19 01:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@Mylo 
as far as I observed, the cc related RPC have all args as strings
In the older (btc based  etc.,) ones args that are numbers don't need quotes
see second bullet in https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/python-rpc-komodod.html#usage
as dimxy said
```
12:45 AM] dimxy: I think this is because in this rpc call the rpc param client conversion feature in rpc/client.cpp is not used, so all params are considered as strings (and if needed, converted into numbers inside the rpc call. So for curl they are all strings).
As I can see most of our cc rpc calls do not use client conversion either. If they do we could pass number params as numbers. The methods that use this  are listed in client.cpp.

also @Alright  was able to get `slick-rpc` (python btc rpc wrapper) to work with KMD
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/python-rpc-komodod.html
might be there are similar ones written for BTC in js or other languages that can be easily appropriated

[13-May-19 02:20 PM] TonyL#3577
And there no any adjustment needed for `slick-rpc` client @gcharang since it's just usual client-server connection actually which wrap and send standartized JSON request and doing the same with response (it using pycurl and ujson).
Initially I just input rpcpassword, rpcuser and port and started to make calls - no any adjustments needed

[13-May-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually it should work with any btc fork which using quite standart config and request/response scheme

[13-May-19 02:22 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah no adjustments needed, just input the rpcuser/pass and port to the function, as shown in the example in the doc

[13-May-19 02:24 PM] gcharang#6833
Pinned a message.

[13-May-19 02:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh you pinned - actually I've not checked if it works and/or works same way - just googled `programming_language + bitcoinrpc` and pasted first link
But examples in readmes looks like it should work

[13-May-19 02:35 PM] gcharang#6833
It's ok, it is just so that it won't get lost
later people familiar with the different languages should check if each of them will work

the buy is for 100 tokens @ 0.0888

[14-May-19 02:20 PM] Mylo#8306
the sells are for 1000 tokens @ 0.09998 and 0.1111

[14-May-19 02:21 PM] Mylo#8306
are the values in the response for `amount` `bidamount` `totalrequired` correct?

[14-May-19 02:22 PM] Mylo#8306

@Mylo there have been some changes to assets/tokens, I don't know if it will help the exact issue you are facing, but these are the docs in construction for now:

cheers will read over.

[14-May-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
`case 1` offer to buy tokens with price 0.08880000 each for 8.88000000 max, so totalrequired 100 tokens to fill this order (8.88000000 / 0.08880000 = 100)
`case 2` offer to sell 1000 tokens with 0.1111 price each so 0.11110000 * 1000 = 111.10000000
case3 is the same as case2

[14-May-19 04:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo

[14-May-19 04:51 PM] Mylo#8306
yes.  why is amount on the buy 8.88 but on teh sell it's 1000?

[14-May-19 04:51 PM] Mylo#8306
is one coin one token, depending on if it's a buy or sell?

[14-May-19 04:52 PM] Mylo#8306
`amount` is confusing because it flips. . but docs don't describe it well enough (imo)

[14-May-19 04:52 PM] dimxy#2587
for buy you are actually 'selling' your coins for tokens that s why amount in coins
for sell you selling your tokens for  coins - amount in tokens

[14-May-19 04:52 PM] Mylo#8306
ok that makes sense

[23-May-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @akiii 
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/tokens.html
Here you can find tokens documentation

Actually make NFT is very simple, all you need is to create a token with supply 1, for it you have to use 1 satoshi as input (second argument of tokencreate call):
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokencreate MYTOKEN 0.00000001 "My very own NFT token."```

[23-May-19 02:26 PM] akiii#2220
@TonyL but if i want for example create 100 MYTOKEN but all different description it is possible ?

[23-May-19 02:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's possible to create token with any supply/description you want. But in case of supply > 1 it'll be not NFT

[23-May-19 02:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Just FYI, limitations are: 
32 symbols for token name
4096 for token description

[23-May-19 02:29 PM] TonyL#3577
So you can write metadata of NFT to description

[23-May-19 02:30 PM] akiii#2220
But for cryptokittie all character are a non fungible token

[23-May-19 02:31 PM] akiii#2220
But they can have the same name no ?

[23-May-19 02:31 PM] akiii#2220
With different power etc

[23-May-19 02:33 PM] TonyL#3577
You can just write needed information to token description:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokencreate KITTYTOKEN 0.00000001 "{
"type": "Catassin"
"name": "Meow Killa",
"srength": 21,
"superpower": "fluffy"
}
"```

[23-May-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
And you can create as many KITTYTOKEN NFT as your dapp need

[23-May-19 02:35 PM] akiii#2220
Oh okay

[23-May-19 02:36 PM] akiii#2220
And how can you extract this description ?

[23-May-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
`tokencreate` call will generate transaction hex as output. After you broadcast it by `sendrawtransaction hex` you'll get transaction id (we can call it token id)

[23-May-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
And then you'll able to check information as:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokeninfo tokenid`

[23-May-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
And you'll see something like a:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokeninfo 43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add

Issue `tokeninfo` rpc call request with tokenid as argument, and show player needed data from response

[23-May-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
In documentation which I shared above you can find curl examples

[23-May-19 02:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Exact implementation of interaction with RPC (we can call it blockchain API) depends of language which you'll use in your application

[23-May-19 02:53 PM] TonyL#3577
upd: Sorry for confusion, there is no curl examples in doc above

[23-May-19 02:54 PM] TonyL#3577
```curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "tokeninfo", "params": ["43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/```
