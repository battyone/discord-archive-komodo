yes tokentransfer on MORTY works properly

[26-Oct-19 12:39 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I wasn't able to create a token (‚òù) but I can get my token address.
The balance of 3 seems to match the 3 MYLO6 I have.

probably there is some differences between komodod used in LABS vs the official komodod, idk

[26-Oct-19 12:40 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll update and see if that helps.  Then üí§

thanks; anyways I'll continue testing on MORTY

[26-Oct-19 12:42 PM] CrisF#3405
btw, KB is the second person who has asked me specifically about tokens on Komodo. 
I was originally asking for a different project.  And to learn more so I could answer general questions more sensibly.

[26-Oct-19 12:43 PM] CrisF#3405
There has been a lot of talk here about tokenizing assets over the last few months.  Especially in the last few weeks with many ETH people over here for DEVCON.

Ahh, this server has phm87's version of komodo for tCHIPS testing.  Maybe that is what is happening.

LABS and komodo are much the same, except some RPC calls. Token transfer never worked that well for me, when i tested it. NFT seemed to work fine though.

[27-Oct-19 07:26 PM] dimxy#2587
This  "error": "some inputs signed not with -pubkey=pk" means that token creator wallet has other privkey(s) in addition to -pubkey=pk.
It is recommended that the tokencreator has only one pk in the wallet.
Actually this check prevents that a token creator creates a token and puts some pubkey in the token opreturn data for which he does not have the privkey (making the token users believe that the token is really created by the one whose pubkey is in the token data)

[27-Oct-19 09:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why not just filter the inputs so it only uses the correct ones?

{Reactions}
üëÄ 

[28-Oct-19 09:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks for the explanation, @dimxy.
Is it possible to filter the inputs as Blackjok3r suggested, or should I make a new wallet with only the token pubkey in it?

[28-Oct-19 09:41 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes thank you and blackjok very much, in fact I have already done this ( just changed to AddNormalInputs2 which filters mypk inputs by design. Just have not pushed yet)

@CrisF nice ! Can you post your pubkey here or DM me ?

Hi @PHBA2061, pubkey is `03d3c1472a363829dfa9ef24625c40c3c5accef4cd6c6b7cd9120bad0f9f1123c7`

I send you 1 pok√©mon, it will automatically shows up when the next block confirms

if you click on VERIFY, it will sign&verify a message to prove that you actually own that pubkey, the number will then turn green

Didn't need to verify this time.  Already green and `Verify` button off.

[01-Nov-19 08:32 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, once you verify you won't need to verify until you change your pubkey

[01-Nov-19 08:34 AM] PHBA2061#2530
now if you check tokeninfo of for example `komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY tokeninfo d8d83d73bed2acd693607076e4e097689c1de9f5c542dfdb177f459a6ee5154a` you will see that the owner is `039fc98c764bc85aed97d690d7942a4fd1190b2fa4f5f4c5c8e0957fac5c6ede00` (it's me)

[01-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not super familiar with the tokens structure, but is there some way of knowing the difference between tokens based on origin? Like the creators pubkey? Like what happens if I make my own pokemon token and send it to my pubkey in the app, is there a way (not saying in the app right now, more in general) to test the origin of the token?

[01-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
token is referenced by the txid used to create it, can easily see the pubkey that did it

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[01-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
not sure how well that answers the question ü§∑

[01-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I was thinking if PHBA built an app and wanted to solely handle card issuing, is there a way to check tokens that are sent to a pubkey for the origin to make sure it is "official"

[01-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Regnar#6164
If they can check original pubkey then that works, just a way to make sure someone doesn't create a ton of the strongest cards and send them to a game

[01-Nov-19 02:13 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Alright was right,when using cli-command  like `tokeninfo` or `tokenbalance`, you have to provide the tx that created the token, which acts like the uniqe id of that token <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html#tokeninfo>

[01-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea the `owner` response is what I was thinking. This way there could be multiple pokemon games and by creating a GUI that only displays specific Owner tokens, or only allows those in gameplay, you can prevent a situation where someone makes a bunch of a powerful card and floods the card market. Or you can leave it blank, or build a white list to accept tokens from multiple sources

[01-Nov-19 08:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool!

[01-Nov-19 11:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Is there a way that tokens could be shown on an explorer?

[01-Nov-19 11:14 PM] phm87#7395
we can adapt an existing explorer code

{Reactions}
üëç 

[01-Nov-19 11:15 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if we need an explorer with txindex or not ...

[01-Nov-19 11:16 PM] phm87#7395
explorers with txindex are better but the only one that I know is iquidus explorer and its source is really wonky and I had troubles to install it

[01-Nov-19 11:17 PM] phm87#7395
explorer without txindex makes sense if you want to show only the tokens from the token distributor (I imagine a pool to simplify)

[01-Nov-19 11:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Would each token ID require a separate explorer?

[01-Nov-19 11:18 PM] phm87#7395
there is one into yiimp in PHP that I can adapt. I won't give a try on iquidus because it was too painful with it

[01-Nov-19 11:20 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know enough tokens to tell you. What I can do is to set up a token distributor and try with and without your ID. I think that if you can have 10 ID's of tokens on the same nodes, then only one explorer for the 10 ID's is enough

[01-Nov-19 11:21 PM] phm87#7395
can you do tx with different token ID on the same running node ?

[01-Nov-19 11:21 PM] phm87#7395
(maybe we already have what you want with the display of pokemons per address created by PHBA2061)

{Reactions}

[01-Nov-19 11:22 PM] CrisF#3405
For example in PHBA's app, each character has it's own tokenid, would a meta-explorer showing all tokens (characters) inn an address be possible (`  "PubkeyCCaddress(Tokens)": "RBkmaRaa6LeyTRaiD1tYqQc9bEF6gvwLnu",
`?)

[01-Nov-19 11:23 PM] CrisF#3405
`can you do tx with different token ID on the same running node`
Yes, all the pokemon tokens are running on the same chain (MORTY).

[01-Nov-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405
There are many types of address.  Don't know if that makes it easier or harder.

[01-Nov-19 11:28 PM] CrisF#3405

[01-Nov-19 11:31 PM] phm87#7395
I'll have a look at this after finishing to test apow into chips. But I think that PHBA may adapt an explorer before I do anything ^^ (or CHMEX maybe as he likes explorers)

all cc smartchains have -addressindex enabled, this is basically the rpc calls the insight explorer uses. look at the addressindex rpc calls

[02-Nov-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just issue these rpc calls for the pages that display transactions for an address. there is no need for the explorer to have a DB, it is built into the komodod
