OK, coins first, then MM.

[12-Jul-18 06:46 PM] jansako#3330
Thanks!

[12-Jul-18 06:47 PM] jansako#3330
OR maybe just kill MM and BOTS, then restart them both?

[12-Jul-18 06:47 PM] cipi#4502
yes, that would also help 😃

[12-Jul-18 06:48 PM] jansako#3330
q: when starting MM, do I issue the ./setpassphrase from the same terminal as the ./client, or from a new one?

[12-Jul-18 06:48 PM] cipi#4502
you could also take a look at the debug.log from the daemons, especially when they are started, they say some stuff about ports and so on

[12-Jul-18 06:48 PM] jansako#3330
sounds good, thx!

[12-Jul-18 06:49 PM] cipi#4502
it does not matter from which terminal... i use a second terminal to get rid of the output from client or reroute the output to a log-file

[12-Jul-18 06:49 PM] jansako#3330
nice, thanks!

[12-Jul-18 07:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i got the Bdex issues sorted out

[12-Jul-18 07:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ran a old version i have

[12-Jul-18 07:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then restarted the new version and it listed the coins again

[12-Jul-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but what was the cause of the missing button?

[12-Jul-18 07:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have no idea. Seems like there might be an issue with how the coins.json file is generated

[12-Jul-18 07:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
once you have a  good coins.json file, the systems can pull the coins

[12-Jul-18 07:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in my particular case it could have been that i used a fork i have to use non-etomic mm and that messed up the coins.json file

[12-Jul-18 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, im seeing a bunch of new coins traded

[12-Jul-18 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
AST, AE, i saw another one i dont remember the name for now

[12-Jul-18 08:02 PM] cipi#4502
i test the coins that are already in BarterDEX, but that no one tested, like AST... artem and lukechilds also play around with AE, it is also already in BarterDEX

[12-Jul-18 08:03 PM] cipi#4502
btw, next is RCN, SNGLS, CDT ... all are already in the coinsdb

[13-Jul-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found with scaletest stuff... if you have a lot of deamons and marketmakers... its best to set a firewall like so:
```sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing
sudo ufw enable
start everything
sudo ufw disable```

[13-Jul-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this lets everything bind to the ports it wants before opening outgoing/incoming connections which can and do use up the ports that the deamons want.

[13-Jul-18 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
*provided you use ufw

[13-Jul-18 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
😛

[13-Jul-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I guess you can do it with other tools, but that was the fastest and easiest way to do it

Did your swap finally go through?

[15-Jul-18 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007

[15-Jul-18 07:00 PM] SHossain#0007
1 tx machine generating 1tx/min is ok

[15-Jul-18 07:01 PM] SHossain#0007
in the meantime, if swaps happening, that will also trigger new blocks

[15-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Jonathan#3687

nice

[15-Jul-18 07:11 PM] SHossain#0007
getting new blocks plays an important role as well for chains with on-demand block generation

[15-Jul-18 07:14 PM] SHossain#0007

replicated bug on mac for manage coins drop down disappearing when clicked on "fetch coindb update" button.

[16-Jul-18 06:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
For a work around, if it happens, just pressing CMD/CTRL+R (View/Reload Menu) and going back to manage coins screen shows the updated drop down menu.

[16-Jul-18 06:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, it's the issue from in between the update process.

[16-Jul-18 06:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will take a look a it some time soon, but would really appreciate if someone can help with this issue.

[16-Jul-18 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian the copy/paste issue is not with the text input fields.
the copy/paste issue is ONLY with the body text. You select text on the html body anywhere, and the shortcut keys for copy/cut/pate doesn't work.
that needs fix.
