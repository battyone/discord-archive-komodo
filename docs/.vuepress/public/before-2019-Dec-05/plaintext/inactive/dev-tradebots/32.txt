i recommend to use artems releases from here for mm: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases
i use them since a long time and they work just fine
@siu - Chainmakers i see the same when trying to buy KMDICE as alice... bob should look in the console output... and also ensure he is on the right chain with KMDICE (it forked couple of times)

We are dropping support of Denarius (DNR) in Agama wallet and BarterDEX due to their electrum (SPV) servers are outdated most of the time which doesn't allow users to use DNR in Agama and BarterDEX properly. Anyone using DNR please contact the DNR team for any further support on that coin.

The are both GUI on top of same API served by same daemon. Choose which one you want. I suggest you use HyperDEX

[07-Nov-18 04:59 AM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah i'll have to try out hyperdex, i remember the utxo management was a bit difficult with barterdex maybe hyperdex is a bit more streamlined, at least that was one of the benefits being touted a while back about it

[07-Nov-18 01:46 PM] tolken#2655
@CiPhEr  HyoerDex is much more streamlined, but I still haven‚Äôt had any success trading with it. Most of my trades get to the ‚Äúconnect‚Äù stage then stall out. But yeah, I think yesterday there was maybe only 1 trade on BarterDex within a 24h period. My guess is that most people have the same experience I have when trying and just give up, otherwise BarterDex would be flourishing with a fair bit more volume. There‚Äôs plenty of liquidity on the Marketmaker side for most of the main pairs, but very few alices trying to buy.

Which method should I use to create a market order? `dump`? `fomo`?

[19-Nov-18 07:35 PM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice`, `setprice` `buy` `sell`

[19-Nov-18 07:36 PM] SHossain#0007
`dump` and `fomo` are special cases

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] wbradt#2043
But `buy` and `sell` require a price, don't they?

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007
dump and fomo can't place bob orders. those need to be used when there are orders from bob

[19-Nov-18 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice` and `setprice` is needed to create bob orders

[19-Nov-18 07:42 PM] wbradt#2043
I have read that. I have an Alice and a Bob node set up.

[19-Nov-18 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
bob uses `autoprice` or `setprice` and alice needs to use `buy` or `sell`

[19-Nov-18 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
alice also can use `fomo` and `dump`

[19-Nov-18 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
but, for that bob orders need to be present

[19-Nov-18 07:44 PM] wbradt#2043
So can a bob not specify the maximum volume it wants to sell?

[19-Nov-18 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
use `amount` field on the autoprice script

alice without price use `fomo` or `dump`

[19-Nov-18 08:05 PM] wbradt#2043

[19-Nov-18 08:08 PM] wbradt#2043
The docs say the `buy` endpoint "will be added in the orderbook" if there is no matching order.  But in another spot it says `buy` is fill or kill. Isn't this contradictory?

[19-Nov-18 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
BarterDEX is an auction system, not traditional exchange

[19-Nov-18 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
there can be negative spread

[19-Nov-18 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have a winning bid, it will be filled. otherwise, not filled

[19-Nov-18 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007

barterDEX also doesn't use balance, it uses UTXO

[19-Nov-18 08:13 PM] wbradt#2043
So is it not contradictory due to the nature of BarterDEX?
