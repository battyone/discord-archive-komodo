I have already tried the shortcut accelerators you tried in your test code. Didn't work for me in my trials. Hope someone can find the core issue and could fix it.

Morning all.  How does a 'bob fell asleep' manifest itself?  I hear from people posting here that one should restart bob's periodically, is there a way to tell that it is time to do so?

[16-Jul-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if the bob goes unresponsive, maybe mem use over the days increases too much

The traditional Barterdex isn't working. I'm unable to add any coins with this new system that the gui has. We need a more reliable and intuitive way of adding coins. Currently it's difficult if not impossible to use.

you have to go in manage coins and reset all

Roger, thanks!

default local coins db are also automatically default startup coins?

Guess it's not, might be something to add in the future

As I think people that add stuff to the local coins db

[18-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
might also want them as default startup coins

I could not work out how to add the coins I wanted as my coins JSON and startup coins.

[18-Jul-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that same thing... I found it confusing.

[18-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah the difference between local coins db and startup coins isnt clear

[18-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or why there is a distinction at all

[18-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would assume local coins db is automatically are automatically startup coins, but they werent

[18-Jul-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no, the marketmaker is "fed" a  "list" of coins on startup, but then you have to enable the ones you want to use.

[18-Jul-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Before the entire "list" of coins was sent, but that exceeded 256 which is the limit of marketmaker.

I have that error on my Bob also, didn't seem to affect anything when I was testing yesterday, I will see if I can get it to happen again today for you.

[18-Jul-18 08:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Might explain the endless loops of wait for Bob deposit it had a few days back that forced a restart

[18-Jul-18 08:48 PM] tolken#2655
I keep getting almost all of my KMD‚Äôs reserved without any swaps lately. Restarting releases them, but unclear what‚Äôs locking them all up. Have yet to rebuild my setup, so probably just something specific to my config.

[18-Jul-18 11:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What locks it is "swap never started"

[19-Jul-18 03:50 AM] tolken#2655
Thought some sort of timeout would autorrlease them. Ether that time out is really really long or something else is up.

[19-Jul-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jl told me they should unlock in 5mins... but this does not seem to be the case at all. If you can reproduce it maybe he can fix it. I worked around it every time, by just having about 100x more UTXO than I need, but for real funds/ non dICO thats not really feasable.

don't post WIF anywhere, that's your secret.

[19-Jul-18 06:09 AM] tolken#2655
@blackjok3r it has been happening quite aggressively lately, as in all of my larger UTXOs are eaten up. 65s, 70, 100, etc. A couple times the kmd balance starts at about 615kmd, end of day it shows 12kmd.  I see no pending swaps. Reboot mm, they‚Äôre all back. I‚Äôll do what I can to isolate it, but not entirely sure what to look out for.

[19-Jul-18 06:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
neither was I....

[19-Jul-18 06:12 AM] tolken#2655
Firewall disabled, using canbind: 1. Have had many successful bob trades on multiple coins (btc, bch, etc) but still running into difficulty reliably getting Alice trades to go though. Probably rejected bob trades too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all related.

[19-Jul-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810

[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> i have written a perl-script to set prices in mm: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
it uses CMC V2 API or CMC paid API
CMC paid API is great, since all prices can be fetched in one call (does not work in v2 API)
when using non-paid v2 API, prices must be fetched one by one for every coin, so take care how often you call the script...
config file like this is needed, including cmcid of coin (using coin symbols does not work reliably, since some symbols are used twice)
```
{
    "BTC": {
        "cmcid": 1,
        "bidmargin": 0.05,
        "askmargin": 0.05
    },
    "LTC": {
        "cmcid": 2,
        "bidmargin": 0.05,
        "askmargin": 0.05
    },
    "SIB": {
        "cmcid": 1082,
        "bidmargin": 0.07,
