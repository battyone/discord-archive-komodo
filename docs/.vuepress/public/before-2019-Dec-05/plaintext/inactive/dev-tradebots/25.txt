ok, maybe just a one off

[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's late here

[15-Aug-18 06:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
will test again with the new build tomorrow and let you know if I still experience matching issues

[15-Aug-18 06:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help 👍

[16-Aug-18 04:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c IDs seem to be working now, thanks!

[16-Aug-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
owever I only updated Alice

[16-Aug-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
not Bob

[16-Aug-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
I was assuming this would be a Bob side change

[16-Aug-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
as it looked like bob was sending the suffixed IDs

[16-Aug-18 04:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
is it expected that only an update to alice's mm is needed?

[16-Aug-18 04:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c  I just got error -9999 (unmatched) on a gtc order

[16-Aug-18 05:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that a bug

[16-Aug-18 05:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
shouldn't it remain open until it gets matched

[16-Aug-18 05:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
and not time out

[16-Aug-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
well it times out, but comes back from the dead

[16-Aug-18 05:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it does

[16-Aug-18 05:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
looks like it's a regression in the latest release

[16-Aug-18 05:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't seem to ever re issue the order

[16-Aug-18 05:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
almost like the gtc flag is being ignored

[16-Aug-18 05:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
just reverted to the old build and it worked as expected

[16-Aug-18 05:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
let me try on the new build again and double check

[16-Aug-18 05:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
also

[16-Aug-18 05:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
>is it expected that only an update to alice's mm is needed?

[16-Aug-18 05:42 PM] lukechilds#2707

[16-Aug-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the cccccc was needed?

[16-Aug-18 05:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
how are you differentiating between normal orders and gtc orders internally?

[16-Aug-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a gtc flag now, so if the JSON has gtc:1 it should work as gtc

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
so do alice and bob both need to be updated to understand the gtc flag?

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
or will it work with only alice being updated?

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you should update both

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[16-Aug-18 05:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't that mean it's a network breaking change?

[16-Aug-18 05:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
only updated bobs will interpret them as gtc orders

[16-Aug-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the gtc flag has been there for a while

[16-Aug-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the SWAP JSON that prints should have it

[16-Aug-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
does it?

[16-Aug-18 05:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't see any SWAP JSON because the swap times out before it matches

[16-Aug-18 05:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
I will try updating my Bob and see if that resolves it

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
bit it seems like a clientside (Alice) issue to me

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i checked for the cccccc and there was only one place using it, so it seemed safe to remove

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
there could be no bobs online, it should still keep re-broacasting

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be very persistent

[16-Aug-18 05:51 PM] lukechilds#2707
so it seems strange that the version of mm bob is running would cause alice to kill early

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
good point, you should be able to see it do things without any bobs

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt do more than one call?

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I can on the previous build

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
not on the latest

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
does one call

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
then get the  -9999 (unmatched) error

[16-Aug-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i am idiot

[16-Aug-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i disabled the code that queues a gtc order, when i got rid of the cccccc

[16-Aug-18 05:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
that sounds important

[16-Aug-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix to jl777, propagating to the usual places

[16-Aug-18 05:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks

[16-Aug-18 05:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
perfect

[16-Aug-18 05:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
just going to grab some food

[16-Aug-18 05:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you can do whatever it is you need to do to kickstart Artems build I'll test that when I'm back

[16-Aug-18 05:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
cheers 👍

[17-Aug-18 08:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c just tried the https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases/tag/v1.0.536 build but it gives me the same issue

[17-Aug-18 08:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
gtc orders fail with -9999 (unmatched) if the don't get matched in the first request

[17-Aug-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but it should issue again in 5 minutes

[17-Aug-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahhh

[17-Aug-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[17-Aug-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
let me wait a few more mins to check

[17-Aug-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there any way we can change that so it doesn't respond with the error?

[17-Aug-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it's a unintuitive to respond with an unmatched error for an order id

[17-Aug-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
if the same id will then be matched later on

[17-Aug-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
there's no way to differentiate in the UI between an order that will never match and an order that won't match for the next five minutes

[17-Aug-18 08:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
currently it will appear in our UI as pending, then failed/unmatched, and then at some point in the future magically match and start swapping

[17-Aug-18 08:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
which is not at all intuitive to users, they may well think it's failed and re-issue the order

[17-Aug-18 08:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it would make more sense to suppress the unmatched event for gtc ordrs

[17-Aug-18 08:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
so they just see it as pending until it matches

[17-Aug-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will try to suppress it for gtc:1 orders

[17-Aug-18 08:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
awesome, thanks

[17-Aug-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix, will propagate it to artem's branch in about an hour

[17-Aug-18 08:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn

[17-Aug-18 08:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
getting the same matching issues as yesterday

[17-Aug-18 08:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
the bob sees all the alice requests

[17-Aug-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
and does something

[17-Aug-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but doesn't fully match

[17-Aug-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think if I leave it long enough it will eventually match one

[17-Aug-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but if I do a normal order it matches instantly

[17-Aug-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
it seems specific to gtc orders

[17-Aug-18 08:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can see all the request messages on Bob

[17-Aug-18 08:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
every 5 mins

[17-Aug-18 08:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
then sometimes it progresses to reserved and connect

[17-Aug-18 08:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
and last time I left it over dinner and when I came back it had connected and swapped

[17-Aug-18 08:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
but something definitely seems not quite right

[17-Aug-18 08:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
are gtc orders any different to normal orders from Bobs perspective?

[17-Aug-18 08:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is it just an abstraction on the Alice end?

[17-Aug-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it just queues up a retry until done process

[17-Aug-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a 10 minute cycle will be better? could be bob still has utxo reserved for a prior swap

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
no it's not that

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm testing in an isolated environment

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
my Bob

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
no other traders

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can seel all the messages I've got here

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
(from alices end)

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
temp1.map(m => m.method)
