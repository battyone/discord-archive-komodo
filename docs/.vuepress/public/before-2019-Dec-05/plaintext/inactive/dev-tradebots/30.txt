@siu - Chainmakers yes, my osx build shows 55M zipped and 140+M as .app

[02-Oct-18 03:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
your electron framwork has 2 copies of it's version in package which is 236.3 MB

[02-Oct-18 03:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
mine is 118.2 MB

[02-Oct-18 03:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
because it's doing symlink to version instead of having a copy

[02-Oct-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be remove electron from your npm global packages and reinstall it

[02-Oct-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
check the files and sizes in dir as showing in screen shot to verify

[02-Oct-18 04:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, will do, thanks

[03-Oct-18 12:01 AM] cipi#4502
@tolken being bob doesn't affect your ability to submit alice buy/sells, but doing the buy/sells will change the price of your bob bids/asks (autoprice), till the autoprice is updated agaian... that was my experience last i did that on a bob... but i use "dedicated" alice/bobs since some time and didn't tried it again

[03-Oct-18 06:08 AM] tolken#2655
Interesting, great to know. I was wondering why it was mentioning autoprice when I was doing Alice buys. That said, it could be coincidence but on many occasions I have a trouble matching an alice Buy, but then I start mm without my autoprice set and the buy then goes through. Was so consistent I just assumed that was by design.

[03-Oct-18 11:46 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi I seem to have another failed kmd/btc swap, although my bob remained online the whole time. I noticed this error: ```
swapdata rawtx has null txbytes
error from basilisk_swapdata_rawtx.bobpayment 0x103a3d8cc len.0
error sending bobpayment
```

[03-Oct-18 04:30 PM] coiin#0708
could anyone help me with Barterdex? Want to trade KMD/DEX

[03-Oct-18 04:31 PM] coiin#0708
offers there but no trade status.

[03-Oct-18 04:33 PM] Acura#2748
@coiin you can also buy from coinexchange.io or try HyperDex

[03-Oct-18 04:34 PM] coiin#0708
coinexchange is 3 times bigger Price. Hyperdex "hangs" also. We wrote yesterday in telegram

[03-Oct-18 04:35 PM] coiin#0708
Nabob on Hyperdex-official "send" me to #dev-tradebots

[03-Oct-18 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
it could be the bob nodes need restart. you can test COQUI/BEER or COQUI/PIZZA to learn how the BarterDEX works. the orderbook should be live and @siu - Chainmakers manage them.

[03-Oct-18 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
or choose another active pair

[03-Oct-18 04:39 PM] coiin#0708
thanks, then i have to try and error?!  Little long way to find out. Is there no actual howto?

[03-Oct-18 04:42 PM] coiin#0708
I'm just in Barterdex with trade offer open. Could i upload something helpful?

[03-Oct-18 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007

i thought you had something to show

[03-Oct-18 04:46 PM] coiin#0708

[03-Oct-18 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
if there is a active pair and orderbook is there. the swap should work

[03-Oct-18 04:48 PM] coiin#0708

Limit price order immediate  had red sign, so i went to Limit price order good 'til canceled.

[03-Oct-18 05:00 PM] coiin#0708
to be sure a made one  make invetory

[03-Oct-18 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
the the first option, immediate to start with testing or swapping

[03-Oct-18 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
2nd and 3rd option is to be a bob

[03-Oct-18 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't see anything wrong with your screenshot

[03-Oct-18 05:05 PM] coiin#0708
but still hangs for one our. tried since yseterday several times

[03-Oct-18 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
it's not hanged, your order is there as bob order. you need to wait for an alice to appear and fill your order

[03-Oct-18 05:06 PM] coiin#0708
but under buyers there is me and second one

[03-Oct-18 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
then, it will be there until you cancel it or someone buy that order

[03-Oct-18 05:07 PM] SHossain#0007
you have selected the wrong option in the left box

[03-Oct-18 05:07 PM] SHossain#0007
use `Limit Price order - immidiate`

[03-Oct-18 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007
use HyperDEX, that would a good step for you. Easy to use.

[03-Oct-18 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007

i just completed a swap while chatting with you using HyperDEX

[03-Oct-18 05:09 PM] coiin#0708
then my offer don't appear
tried Hyperdex with KMD/DEX , stays on 'open' for more hals our

[03-Oct-18 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
use ZCL/KMD pair. i didn't have issue with that

[03-Oct-18 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
barterDEX is not your traditional exchange. Atomic swaps happens here. It works bit different way than centralised exchange.

[03-Oct-18 05:11 PM] coiin#0708
ok, i will try ZCL/KMD , but goal was to get DEX

[03-Oct-18 05:11 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll test KMD/DEX 30 minutes  later,

[03-Oct-18 05:12 PM] coiin#0708
thanks, that time  i'll bring my Kids to bed

[03-Oct-18 06:29 PM] SHossain#0007
you can try again

[03-Oct-18 06:30 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no guaranteed 100% success with marketmaker 1.0

[03-Oct-18 06:32 PM] coiin#0708
i don't need guatantee , but i get headaches. Many examples to read see about successful trades and i got no one working, nor with KMD wether with Beer

[03-Oct-18 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
if it didn't work, try again. until you successfully complete a swap

[03-Oct-18 06:34 PM] coiin#0708
If i use Hyperdex, how long does it take more less to took swap

[03-Oct-18 06:35 PM] SHossain#0007
atomic swap time depends on block confirmation, order matching, bobs connectivity

[03-Oct-18 06:39 PM] coiin#0708
If i could startet the offer means in generell my Hyperdex appimage works, there isnothing missing on my machine

[03-Oct-18 06:41 PM] coiin#0708
thank you anyway, for help

[03-Oct-18 06:50 PM] SHossain#0007
it takes some time to understand all these and get them to work. once you will complete the first one, you will want to do more. atomic swap kind of makes everyone addicted in the end.

[03-Oct-18 07:53 PM] phideas#8309
hey guys. i am learning the tech and getting familiar with cmd line barterdex.  stucked in with one problem. 
buying or selling, request is showing up nicely in log but orderbook is empty, can't start a swap. any suggestion much appreciated.

[03-Oct-18 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to give more information. which pair you are trying, native mode or electrum mode and what exact command you used to run?

[03-Oct-18 08:46 PM] phideas#8309
i am trying with btch/kmd pair. native wallets setup and synced on a  vps server. there i ran 2  bot orders.
```marketmaker-cli bot_buy BTCH KMD 0.0111 0.3
marketmaker-cli bot_sell BTCH KMD 0.0555 3```

[03-Oct-18 08:49 PM] phideas#8309
on a local machine i am running hyperdex with 2  open orders, i see them in log on a vps.
``` uuid.9b5ada3fbf7d0a1167cb6b647f14f1da M.0 g.1 f.0      request  BTCH/KMD     0.06030019 ->   0.06010000 ( 0.99684542)
 uuid.35095a53e9fd56afa58726e5454d9bb9 M.0 g.1 f.0      request   KMD/BTCH    0.03020119 ->   3.00010000 (99.37004802)```

[03-Oct-18 08:55 PM] phideas#8309
before bot_buy and bot_sell, i was trying a simple buy and sell orders on a vps. same results. request in a log, see them on a second machine  but empty orderbook.
i am probably doing something wrong, still learning the basics.

[03-Oct-18 08:58 PM] phideas#8309
local pc is behind nat, i forwarded port 7783 to my machine, it didn't help

[03-Oct-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
don't use bot_*

[03-Oct-18 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
use normal buy or sell script

[03-Oct-18 09:02 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to put an order as bob aka seller, use `autoprice` script

[03-Oct-18 09:03 PM] SHossain#0007
copy or customize it as your liking

[03-Oct-18 09:08 PM] phideas#8309
gonna take a look and try. thanks shossain.

clean vm, barely anything on it

Here is a guide explaining a possible solution for this issue  https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000025600-barterdex-javascript-error-/en

[04-Oct-18 10:39 PM] MarcM9000#8247
i am upgrading from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 on mac 10.11.6
the 1.1.2 stays on Starting BarterDex. Please wait... is there a trick to upgrading on mac?

[04-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Hermes#6934
I will say more likely sometimes to make a fresh installation

[04-Oct-18 11:48 PM] Hermes#6934
is better than having to upgrade your OS

[04-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Hermes#6934
Barterdex is portable but still the Barterdex folder is created in Appdata....sometimes erasing that folder and launching Barterdex again can solve that issue, But bewarned only to do this if you don't have any pending or stuck swap ...because your swap file is in that folder I just mentioned.

[05-Oct-18 01:36 AM] MarcM9000#8247
i‚Äôm on mac os. so no AppData. i deleted barterdex in library application support and rebooted.
 but on start is still sits on wait forever. is there another folder or file to delete on mac? What do you mean fresh installation?

[05-Oct-18 02:18 AM] Nabob#5004
before you delete barterdex folder have you checked no marketmaker instance running in background
check with this
`ps -ef | grep marketmaker`

if it is, kill that process

[05-Oct-18 03:33 AM] MarcM9000#8247
yes. i killed it. and then rebooted. still hangs.  at this point 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 do the same thing. even if i delete barterdex. another idea?

[05-Oct-18 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
have you already deleted/moved the BarterDEX data directory ?

[05-Oct-18 03:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
linux: ~/.BarterDEX
mac: ~/Library/Applications Support/BarterDEX
win: %AppData%\BarterDEX

[05-Oct-18 03:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
these are not the applications. these are the data directory.

[05-Oct-18 03:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
close BarterDEX
make sure `marketmaker` is not running in background. kill it with taskmanager/monitor if required
Move or delete barterdex data directory
start barterdex app
it should start.
if doesn't either the bundled marketmaker is not good or there is some other process like antivirus is causing it to not start for system security etc.

[05-Oct-18 06:25 AM] Nabob#5004
@MarcM9000 provide screenshot on which point it hangs?

[07-Oct-18 05:09 PM] cipi#4502
@tolken the reason why bob couldn't send bobpayment is not contained in the log message
```swapdata rawtx has null txbytes
error from basilisk_swapdata_rawtx.bobpayment 0x103a3d8cc len.0
error sending bobpayment```
there should be some other output...
such swaps should be rewinded automatically after couple of hours (4-12) and you can try to speed it up by calling `swapstatus` manually

[07-Oct-18 05:10 PM] cipi#4502
@phideas there are no entries in BTCH/KMD orderbooks and i don't have BTCH bids/asks on the 2 bobs i manage

[07-Oct-18 05:17 PM] phideas#8309
thanks cipi! my inet was broken for 3 days, wasn't able to experiment more. i reached isp fup monthly limit and they cut me off.
today got a second backup inet, so i am happy to play with barterdex again.

try to work out that but not getting there. tried both on linux and windows but cant claim. problem since its older type of claim? its 10kmd and not 10.1kmd.

[09-Oct-18 12:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
are you on CLI or on a GUI?
