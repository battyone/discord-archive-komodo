@jl777c found something that i think should be addressed either in mm directly or in the GUIs... if you withdraw Bitcoin Cash (BCH), mm accepts the old address format and creates the transaction, but the coins are sent to a wrong address... mm shows an error regarding address decoding, but creates the transaction
```added 64 of 64 from BCH listunspents

i think that if the error `bech32_decode error` is shown, the transaction should not be sent out...
if the new address format is used, everything is fine

[26-Jul-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
this is just in withdraw, swaps work fine?

[26-Jul-18 07:06 AM] cipi#4502
yes, swap works fine, only in withdraw when you input old address format

[26-Jul-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will add a check to prevent old style adresses

[26-Jul-18 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed change to jl777 branch

[26-Jul-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know if it works, if it does I will merge it into dev

[26-Jul-18 07:46 AM] cipi#4502
looks good... when i do withdraw with old address (1AfQJNq44qGMqbrTn2GkFNkkBNctsqKcwy), mm now shows this in console
```BCH LP_createrawtransaction 1AfQJNq44qGMqbrTn2GkFNkkBNctsqKcwy i.0 of 1 is invalid```
and returns this
```{"txid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","txfee":1000,"complete":false}```

[26-Jul-18 03:42 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Agama Lite mode still uses old style bch addresses, i'm pretty sure. Is there a way to convert old addresses to new so that the withdraw could still work with old ones?

[28-Jul-18 04:25 PM] barv#0867
Does anyone know how the GUI fee is calculated and paid?

[28-Jul-18 04:31 PM] barv#0867
we are working on various GUI's for barterdex transactions and have to get the revenue model clear

[28-Jul-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
add a "gui":"guiname" to the trade commands

[28-Jul-18 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
10% of the fee from GUI. if both sides of a trade use the GUI, then it would be 20% of the fee

[28-Jul-18 05:05 PM] barv#0867
So the dex fee is 0,15%, > 10% of 0,15% is for the used GUI?

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[28-Jul-18 05:17 PM] barv#0867
Cool. Thx @jl777c  And how do you collect these fees for a GUI?

[28-Jul-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
automatic, part of the protocol

[28-Jul-18 05:20 PM] barv#0867
To an address we provide somewhere?

[28-Jul-18 05:23 PM] jorian#4555
RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf afaik

[28-Jul-18 05:25 PM] barv#0867
?

[28-Jul-18 05:26 PM] jorian#4555
that's where dexfee goes

[28-Jul-18 05:27 PM] barv#0867
You put "gui":"guiname" with the tx. Then DEX splits to your GUI? Then DEX needs your address I suppose?

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Meyse#0952
How does the both sides, 20% thing work, because only 1 side pays dexfees?

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
the DEXfee is done through a hash, and that hash results in an address. that hash is fixed, james knows the specifics

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] jorian#4555
so for KMD it's RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf and for BTC it's 1KRhTPvoxyJmVALwHFXZdeeWFbcJSbkFPu

[28-Jul-18 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
stuff is a bit blurry on the KMD side, since some assets are stored at that address. so you can't know for sure how much dexfees were collected, if you were to check atomicexplorer

[28-Jul-18 05:30 PM] jorian#4555
if you make 2 gui's, one for bob and one for alice, and both bob and alice gui you made were used in 1 trade, then you get 20%

[28-Jul-18 05:33 PM] barv#0867
And if bob uses cli you dont pay dex fee at all?

[28-Jul-18 05:33 PM] barv#0867
You being bob

[28-Jul-18 05:34 PM] Meyse#0952
bob never pays dexfee?

[28-Jul-18 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
the protocol requires that alice sends a dexfee

[28-Jul-18 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
bob never pays dexfeee

[28-Jul-18 05:34 PM] Meyse#0952
so its just about the gui i suppose

[28-Jul-18 05:35 PM] jorian#4555
yes, though i'm not sure that if you make a gui for bob, you get a piece of the pie too

[28-Jul-18 05:35 PM] barv#0867
It's what @jl777c suggested

[28-Jul-18 05:36 PM] barv#0867
But normally bob would use cli

[28-Jul-18 05:36 PM] barv#0867
However, the how is still fuzzy

[28-Jul-18 05:36 PM] Meyse#0952
yeah but wouldnt it be nice for a noob bob to have some advanced gui instead using cli

[28-Jul-18 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
until now it's the only way i think, no-one made a good bob gui yet. it for sure is the easiest way

[28-Jul-18 05:36 PM] barv#0867
I would like to undrrstand the whole process

[28-Jul-18 05:37 PM] barv#0867
Of the fee collection

[28-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Meyse#0952
if bob puts up liquidity thru the gui, its all registrered "add a "gui":"guiname" to the trade commands"

[28-Jul-18 05:38 PM] barv#0867
Thx @jorian

[28-Jul-18 05:38 PM] jorian#4555
np

[28-Jul-18 05:43 PM] barv#0867
Is there any documentation on this?

[28-Jul-18 05:54 PM] jorian#4555
don't think so

[28-Jul-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
good thing slack is still alive

[28-Jul-18 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
jl777 [Sep 7th, 2017 at 10:51]
Jump
for each coin (alice) the fee is sent to the address generated from the rmd160 hash ca1e04745e8ca0c60d8c5881531d51bec470743f

[28-Jul-18 05:59 PM] barv#0867
Okay. We'll cross that bridge once we get there. At least we have the % right now üòÅ

Hi all, can i ask some questions about barterdex in here? or do i need another channel ? (cant find the right one)

[28-Jul-18 10:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes, shoot (not a barterdex pro myself tho)

[28-Jul-18 10:22 PM] debaas#3337
I think i figured it out already lol. If i wanted to test a ERC20 coin, i need the native wallet to be running right?

[28-Jul-18 10:22 PM] debaas#3337
it will detect the daemon and load the coin

[28-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes and to have it fully synched

[29-Jul-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in BarterDEX you don't actually need ETH/ERC20 synced to local machine. I'm sure many machines today will just fill up the whole HDD with ETH blockchain.
in BarterDEX the marketmaker uses a public ETH Parity Node, which acts like a SPV node for ETH/ERC20.
but in marketmaker the API is set to use the same naitve API command, so just for that the GUI is using the native switch when activating the ETH/ERC20 coin.

In short just activate ETH/ERC20 coin in GUI with 'Native' switch/option selected and you Don't need to sync the full blockchain of ETH/ERC20 on your machine.

[29-Jul-18 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in case of any confusion.

@siu - Chainmakers I'm trying this latest release, when I try adding any Erc20 it spins forever in the portfolio dashboard and if I try closing Bdex it continues spinning until I must force closing

[01-Aug-18 07:01 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
all other coins work

[01-Aug-18 07:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
etomic assetchain doesn't work too, in electrum mode

[01-Aug-18 07:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
could this be the issue?

[01-Aug-18 07:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this might be something Cipi needs to check

@cipi

[01-Aug-18 07:22 PM] cipi#4502
it takes pretty long for ETOMIC to load, i observed this too on CLI... don't know why, but it has something to do with the checks that are done when enabling them (balance, etomic-faucet request and stuff)

[01-Aug-18 07:22 PM] cipi#4502
so just wait

[01-Aug-18 07:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok, I will try leaving it spin for longer

[01-Aug-18 07:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

they should be added in native

[01-Aug-18 07:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes after I added etomic, the erc20 loaded instantly

[01-Aug-18 07:28 PM] cipi#4502
in CLI it is a bit faster then GUI, at least that was my impression, but i haven't measured this...

[01-Aug-18 07:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, perfect

[01-Aug-18 07:39 PM] cipi#4502
oh, the thing that should be tested is the output/display of successful swaps.... the output from marketmaker changed and i don't know how the GUI handles this... i hope it still works
