SWAP completed message too long for posting...

[09-Aug-18 05:48 AM] cipi#4502
btw, ETH chain is broken agaian... bob payed nearly 4$ for the swap... this is totally crazy... will not implement any new erc20-tokens till the gasprice falls below 5 gwei

[09-Aug-18 05:49 AM] cipi#4502
@xcite you sent me a lot of GMBEL... was this intended? Should i send you the tokens back? I don't need that much just for testing...

[09-Aug-18 05:50 AM] xcite#5750
@cipi maybe for tip bro 😃

[09-Aug-18 05:50 AM] xcite#5750
i hope my token listed here 😃

[09-Aug-18 05:51 AM] cipi#4502
thanks... yes, when the above PR is accepted, GMBEL will be visible in BarterDEX GUI: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX

Does anyone have a tiny amount of SUPERNET they could send me to test 0-conf on HyperDEX?

[09-Aug-18 03:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
I tried buying some but I don't seem to be able to get any matches

[09-Aug-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Aug-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c I've tried 0-conf with SUPERNET now too and I'm still unable to make a 0-conf swap

[09-Aug-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
got the same mismatch error

[09-Aug-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
MISMATCHED required confirms me.(1 0) vs (0 0) max.(6 6) othermax.(6 6)
```

[09-Aug-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
Both Alice and Bob have zcredits and can see their own zcredits

[09-Aug-18 04:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
Do I have to do anything on my Bob to enable 0-conf other than have zcredits?

[09-Aug-18 04:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
like manually set required confs to 0 or something?

[09-Aug-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it should be automatic. I will need to duplicate this

[09-Aug-18 04:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, thanks

[09-Aug-18 04:30 PM] lukechilds#2707

[09-Aug-18 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I added printouts about the 0conf, maybe you can run the jl777 branch and get me the console prints

[09-Aug-18 04:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
sure

[09-Aug-18 04:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
do you have etomic changes merged in to jl777 branch?

[09-Aug-18 04:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
or should I disable all ETH/ERC20 pairs?

[09-Aug-18 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, no erc20, just dont swap those for the test

[09-Aug-18 04:37 PM] lukechilds#2707

[09-Aug-18 04:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
So bob thinks Alice doesn't have any zcredits from the look of that

[09-Aug-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing else?

[09-Aug-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, is that bob or alice?

[09-Aug-18 04:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's Bob

[09-Aug-18 04:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
and on Alice calling `instantdex_claim` gives:

```

  "result": "success",
  "claimed": 0,
  "txids": [
    {
      "txid": "73be50a0364b8f2d14bdcf6b57b7b858c0e899307c0c8e520878fbbe16512fa2",

    }

}
```

[09-Aug-18 04:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
(not sure fi there's a proper way to just view zcredits without trying to claim)

[09-Aug-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
alice didnt print out bob's zcredits status?

[09-Aug-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
only during a swap does a node deal with another node's zcredits

[09-Aug-18 04:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
I mean to view your own zcredits

[09-Aug-18 04:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
sorry, I only updated to jl777 branch on my Bob

[09-Aug-18 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
just getcoin for KMD will print

[09-Aug-18 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
bob seems to be fine in all this, it is alice that isnt accepting bob

[09-Aug-18 05:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
But isn't Bob not seeing Alice's zcredits?

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
when Bob says:
```
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.1 bob.0, otheristrusted.0 othertrusts.1
```

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
And alice is also not seeing Bob's zcredits

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
MISMATCHED required confirms me.(1 0) vs (0 0) max.(6 6) othermax.(6 6)

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
whichever node that made that print is the problem size

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
side

[09-Aug-18 05:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's Bob

[09-Aug-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
RKdsx9P79H473wLWRg24VGRqErGNJgiBpr is alice's address?

[09-Aug-18 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and 11 KMD is enough credits for the swap?

[09-Aug-18 05:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep, it was for 0.4 KMD

[09-Aug-18 05:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
and no, `RKdsx9P79H473wLWRg24VGRqErGNJgiBpr` is Bob

[09-Aug-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so it seems alice's address didnt get approved, but it should have printed a rejection of it

[09-Aug-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is definitely some problem with 0conf, I will work on this tomorrow

[09-Aug-18 05:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks

[09-Aug-18 05:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
and btw

[09-Aug-18 05:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's just Bob

[09-Aug-18 05:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
both Alice and Bob have zcredits and can see their own zcredits

[09-Aug-18 05:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
Neither Bob nor Alice can see each others zcredits

[09-Aug-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it seems the problem is communicating the zcredits from the other side

[09-Aug-18 05:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep

[09-Aug-18 05:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok thanks

[09-Aug-18 05:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
let me know if there's anything else I can do to help

[10-Aug-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
I setup a REVS/KMD 0conf swap and it worked fine, both sides showed:
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.0 bob.0, otheristrusted.1 othertrusts.1

[10-Aug-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
one difference is I used SPV for KMD and not REVS. I will test both using SPV next

[10-Aug-18 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the side with autoprice set prints: 
KMD RHV2As4rox97BuE3LK96vMeNY8VsGRTmBj othercredits 10.00000000 debits 0.05010000 + 0.00000000 -> 9.94990000

[10-Aug-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it worked with both being SPV also

[10-Aug-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i made a 10 week deposit for 10 KMD on both nodes

[10-Aug-18 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
I did make an improvement to SPV mode which should reduce false positive errors. one thing that could be happening is that it cant find the deposit txid on the other node

[10-Aug-18 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
now up to 5 swaps using SPV for both coins on both nodes and all were 0 conf, so the issue isnt 0conf but more likely SPV returning some error looking up the 0conf deposit txid

[10-Aug-18 10:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn ok, for what it's worth I was using a full node on my Bob and SPV on my Alice

[10-Aug-18 10:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
is your Bob still up with zcredits?

[10-Aug-18 10:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe I can test against that with my Alice and see if I can swap against it

[10-Aug-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes my bob is still running with REVS, but needs to be small order

[10-Aug-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"fill\":1,\"gtc\":0,\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"buy\",\"base\":\"REVS\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"relvolume\":0.02,\"price\":0.1}"

[10-Aug-18 11:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
Is this your Bob? `RErfj1mJwXv4b9kMoA99cFg7RZoSUArKUb `

[10-Aug-18 12:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't see any orders in the REVS/KMD order book with zcredits

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that is my bob. just try an order the orderbook is imaginary

[10-Aug-18 01:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
matched and swapping but not 0conf

[10-Aug-18 01:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
luke do you use pure cli or a (hyperdex) gui?

[10-Aug-18 01:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
I had your experience when using a gui a while ago somehow my 0conf files get messed up when using a gui

[10-Aug-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
MISMATCHED required confirms me.(1 0) vs (0 0) max.(6 6) othermax.(6 6)
my node didnt think your node has a valid 0conf

[10-Aug-18 01:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm using HyperDEX

[10-Aug-18 01:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm trying to add 0-conf support to HyperDEX

[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
but that shouldn't make a difference

[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm issuing the commands manually to test

[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
although the binary was spawned by the GUI

[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
can you make a 10week deposit?

[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
