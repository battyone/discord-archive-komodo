[23-Jan-19 01:20 PM] cipi#4502
i think best is if i remove confpath from github, so that it does not interfere...

[23-Jan-19 01:20 PM] Jenova#8529
on Windows App, the path is different so it doesn't recognize it

[23-Jan-19 01:22 PM] Jenova#8529
i tried to change the path in BarterDEX\CoinsDB\coins but it's reset at launch

[23-Jan-19 01:22 PM] cipi#4502
yes, confpath paramater has problems in Windows... saw this many times... so best is to not use it

[23-Jan-19 01:22 PM] Jenova#8529
ok

[23-Jan-19 01:22 PM] cipi#4502
it is reset, because it is in github

[23-Jan-19 01:22 PM] Jenova#8529
so if removed from github/code
the app will find the .conf itself or do we have to add it manually?

[23-Jan-19 01:23 PM] Jenova#8529
yes i saw that

[23-Jan-19 01:23 PM] cipi#4502
BarterDEX uses the paramater `name` to find the config file... in Linux it then looks for `~/.$name/$name.conf`

[23-Jan-19 01:24 PM] cipi#4502
confpath was added later because there are coins that don't name the datadir the same as the config file... no idea why

[23-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Jenova#8529
ok

[23-Jan-19 01:25 PM] Jenova#8529
so remove it from code should solved the problem

[23-Jan-19 01:25 PM] cipi#4502
ok, will remove it

what is the problem?

[23-Jan-19 08:43 PM] DRE#7875
@cipi I can add ECA to BarterDex, no problem. In the settings I add ECA to StartUp, works.

1. Then I add ECA on the dashboard, works.
Now, when I restart BarterDex, I have to add ECA to the dashboard, it will not automatically appear.

2. if I have added eca to the dashboard, then i will send my ECA to BarterDex address and they will not arrive

[23-Jan-19 08:45 PM] cipi#4502
i am not familiar with the GUI, since i don't use it, but afaik the coins you add are not saved permanently... but i think there is a way to do it, but i don't know
what does blockexplorer say? can you show me the txid/smartaddress of ECA?

[23-Jan-19 08:49 PM] DRE#7875
TXID 8f88c80c7bfa19b654fb8aac76a67cf96f827bcaa6fbe362d6e3af0d021331eb

https://www.electraexplorer.com/ does not know this txid... looks like it wasn't sent

[23-Jan-19 08:51 PM] DRE#7875
we are work on other chain , thats why ecaexplorer not works

[23-Jan-19 08:52 PM] cipi#4502

@cipi just wanted you to be aware, that when enabling Snowgem via advanced in Agama, in Litemode, no valid backend servers can be found. Not sure if hostname changed or what, but wanted you to be aware

[18-Feb-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi they changed their ticker to XSG a while ago, and that may have something to do with it, electrumX probably needs updating. maybe they changed electrumx hostname/ports when the ticker changed

[18-Feb-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326

[19-Feb-19 12:27 AM] cipi#4502
@dukeleto https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/XSG tells me the XSG servers are `
[{"electrumsvr.snowgem.org":50001},{"electrumsvr2.snowgem.org":50001}]`, but those are not run by me
they are both down, it seems... i think we should remove them if they are not working

@Riddlez666 , does the clone have a public repository? Any changes in the coin APIs that you know of? Have you tried adding the ETH clone into our `coins` file and how did it go if you did?

I presume with a JSON field to indicate it is an ETH clone and another to specify its infuria servers, it wouldnt be too hard to add support

[14-Apr-19 01:47 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
For mm2 the presence of the "etomic" field in the `coins` file switches us into the ETH mode.

but also how to tell that we are not ETH but a clone like litecoin is to bitcoin

[14-Apr-19 01:58 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
kk! @artem.pikulin will later add a definitive answer on these. Meanwhile, @Riddlez666 , I think it'll help if you could give us an example of the Web3 URLs that ought to be used with EGEM.

[14-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Riddlez666#9550
any CURL request like for infuria would/should work like ```curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber", "params": []}' \
"https://lb.rpc.egem.io"```

@Riddlez666 Hi, to swap EGEM with other coins you also have to deploy etomic swap smart contract (https://github.com/artemii235/etomic-swap) to EGEM network, I can see `0xc9360dC1CACCf570B0A73404C7Ba2eca465AC58F` address in your PR (https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/277/files#diff-cb00e2d742e5694f0c91a60aa30a9431R2), but the source code is not validated on explorer: https://explorer.egem.io/addr/0xc9360dc1caccf570b0a73404c7ba2eca465ac58f. Could you please add contract source to help us be sure that it would work?

We have discussed for a long time that #dev-tradebots & #dev-marketmaker are pretty much the same thing. I think we agreed to merge these channels long time ago but it was never done.

I'll move this channel to the "archived" category and we can start using the remaining #dev-marketmaker channel.

If you disagree let me know and we can always undo this change or find an alternative solution.
