@CHMEX yes, i know, i participated in the beta phase. üòÉ  and i wrote a script to update mm-prices with that API:  https://github.com/cipig/mmtools (the setprices-thing)

Problem is that it is still too expensive... i used it for 2 nodes and i need 2000 calls/day to update all prices every 2 minutes... that means i need the "Standard" plan, which costs 300$/month... that is a bit too much... will think about a solution... maybe we can make some kind of deal with cmc, integrate this API in mm, so that everybody can use it and pay for the "Enterprise" plan

[02-Aug-18 06:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes the pricing is bloombergish

[02-Aug-18 06:17 PM] cipi#4502
lol, bloombergish üòÑ nice word ...

[02-Aug-18 06:20 PM] cipi#4502
btw, i looked for some other API-providers and the others are not cheaper... cryptocompare.com has a free API though, but the data is not that good... for example, they don't filter old prices out, so you would have to do it yourself in your price-update-script, else it can happen that you set prices that are actually months old

[02-Aug-18 06:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I used cryptocompare in the past nice thing is you can convert kmd to hush for ex. Directly

[02-Aug-18 06:25 PM] CHMEX#0686
Looks like big money can be made with a good pricing api

[02-Aug-18 06:35 PM] cipi#4502
yes, seems so... btw, the new cmc-API can do that too... i can convert all coins to KMD in one call, which saves calls (instead of doing it for each coin in part) and ressources

[02-Aug-18 11:51 PM] cipi#4502
@jl777c regarding the cmc-API-change: `The Public API will be taken offline on December 4th, 2018. Please migrate your application to the free tier of the Professional API.`
This means that simply switching mm to cmc v2 API will not be enough, everybody that wants to use the API will have to register, get an API key and use it to fetch the price updates.
I think this is not very practical and the problem is that the free API only offers 6k calls/month, or 200/day... this is not much, especially when you have more then one node.
The best solution would be to get a "Enterprise" key and configure it directly in mm, but someone would have to negotiate with CMC. This are the "normal" pricing for CMC API: https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/pricing
What do you think? Is this a way, or should we think about other ways?

[03-Aug-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a problem for mm2 to solve

[03-Aug-18 12:48 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi, if we pay for API key we shouldn't disclosure it to public by putting to open-source marketmaker code. I see a possible solution by developing a simple proxy which will bypass and cache CMC API responses. The API key will be available only to this proxy service.

[03-Aug-18 12:51 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please also ping me or @artemciy_dice when MM2.0 is discussed, it's hard to monitor all groups and we can easily miss something important.

It seems to me that they don't like the idea of a proxy much.

I see there are alternatives to CMC ( https://news.bitcoin.com/8-alternatives-to-coinmarketcap/ ), maybe someone here knows a good one?

3rd party service might change terms any time like CMC.

[03-Aug-18 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
It might be a good idea to support several endpoints to the client can choose from which he wants to receive the data.
one can be CMC include the private client's api key
one can be cryptocompare
one can be the komodo price engine

[03-Aug-18 01:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Personally I don't like the way cmc goes but this gives new opportunities for new players

[03-Aug-18 02:11 PM] tolken#2655
CMC seems like a convenient way to get market prices, but fortunately most exchanges are wide open to freely fetch prices. So while it isnt ideal to have to manually aggregate the data, it doesn‚Äôt seem that far fetched.

[03-Aug-18 02:13 PM] tolken#2655
Hah. Reading back I see I‚Äôm late to the convo, artem already stated this üòõ

[06-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, providing several api endpoints makes it easier for those api developers to then hook into marketmaker with a simple abstraction layer if necessary so the app developer can call popularExchange->getPrice(pair1,pair2) and marketmaker->getPrice(pair1,pair2) down the roadmap.

[06-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Mylo#8306
make their apps portable across CEX & DEX

Any reason why above left can be empty?

[06-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On dashboard I can see balances, but not in tradewindow

[06-Aug-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because the webpage loads faster than electrum can supply info?

[06-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure, the dashboard loads balances within 5 seconds or so

[06-Aug-18 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the call for dashboard isn't the same as the multiple calls on trade screen

[06-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then the tradeview on the upperleft also takes a while to load kmd and eql for example

[06-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But it does not show the balance/address itself

[06-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
once it's *loaded*

[06-Aug-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wait a minute or so and the orderbook loads, so it's not connection related I would assume

[06-Aug-18 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
orderbook is all P2P and coinage calls go to the specific electrum servers

[06-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm ok so spv issue?

[06-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX info is loaded though

[06-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
agama in lite mode worked for kmd but not for barterdex

[06-Aug-18 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my guess is either the SPV itself or slimy possible that it's a change in API

[06-Aug-18 02:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just downloaded new version and started that without restarting my system, going to restart system later and see if that fixes anything

[06-Aug-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or....
you could just give all of your coinage to me and never have to worry about it again üôÇ

[06-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

how to listing token ?

Read the doc on github and contact @cipi

[07-Aug-18 10:55 PM] cipi#4502
@xcite if you want me to add an ERC20 token to BarterDEX, send me some tokens to 0x98298409c949135eeD89233D04C2cFef984baFF5
i will make a test swap and add the token to https://github.com/jl777/coins
will also need a logo for the GUI
you can also make a PR to the coins repo yourself, then you don't need to send me tokens üòÉ

i want sent now

[08-Aug-18 07:59 AM] cipi#4502
don't know what the difference is... i just need some tokens to make a test swap.... could you tell me the contract address? It may be a good idea to have a look at the contract before trying a swap.

[08-Aug-18 03:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
Has anyone successfully got 0conf swaps working?

[08-Aug-18 03:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
@cipi do you have zcredits on any of your bobs?

[08-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've been trying to get this working for the last 2 weeks

[08-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I have zcredits on my Alice dev box

[08-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've setup my own Bob with zcredits

[08-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
I can see the Bob orders from my Alice

[08-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it shows as 0 zcredits

[08-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
checking the order book on the Bob node shows a positive amount of zcredits

[08-Aug-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
I can swap Alice<->Bob but it's not 0-conf

[08-Aug-18 03:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
Tried selling both BEER and an ERC20 on my Bob and neither worked

[08-Aug-18 03:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c @artem.pikulin Any advice would be massively appreciated, really stuck with this

[08-Aug-18 03:42 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi, 0-conf is not available for ETH/ERC20. It's very easy to replace pending transaction just by setting higher gas price.

[08-Aug-18 03:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
ah ok, have you had any experience with 0-conf with BTC protocol currencies?

[08-Aug-18 03:44 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Not sure about non-eth 0conf swaps, I've not worked/tried them.

[08-Aug-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, thanks for your help anyway

[08-Aug-18 03:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
@grewalsatinder did you test this when you added it to the BarterDEX GUI?

[08-Aug-18 04:42 PM] dan.#2473
ive done 0 conf swaps before. it worked on bdex gui

[08-Aug-18 04:43 PM] dan.#2473
well im not 100 percent certain actually. but pretty sure ive had instant swaps when there were z creds happen

[08-Aug-18 05:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
What pair did you trade on?

[08-Aug-18 05:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
If I inspect the order book responses I can't find any orders with zcredits

[08-Aug-18 05:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've tried on lots of popular pairs CHIPS/KMD BTC/KMD BCH/KMD etc

[08-Aug-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
likely the 0conf credits expired for all the LP nodes

[08-Aug-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and it seems ERC20 it is not advisable to use it

[08-Aug-18 05:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've setup my own Bob

[08-Aug-18 05:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
and funded it

[08-Aug-18 05:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
and added zcredits

[08-Aug-18 05:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
I still can't do 0-conf swaps with it

[08-Aug-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
how much time for the zcredits?

[08-Aug-18 06:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
I made the zcredit deposit over 24 hours ago for both Alice and Bob

[08-Aug-18 06:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
and both were 2 week deposits

[08-Aug-18 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what are the console messages when the trades happen?

MISMATCHED required confirms me.(1 0) vs (0 0) max.(6 6) othermax.(6 6)
it seems that that node doesnt see the zcredits

[08-Aug-18 08:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, that's the issue I explained above

[08-Aug-18 08:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Alice has zcredits

[08-Aug-18 08:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Bob has zcredits

[08-Aug-18 08:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Alice doesn't think Bob has zcredits

[08-Aug-18 08:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
And that log was from Bob, so it sounds like you're saying Bob doesn't think Alice has zcredits either

[08-Aug-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it shows that alice doesnt think bob has enough credits. it could be due to using BEER

[08-Aug-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if a coin doesnt have a price in the orderbooks, it wont know what price to use against the credits

[08-Aug-18 08:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
ah, ok

[08-Aug-18 08:07 PM] lukechilds#2707
will try with a different currency

[08-Aug-18 11:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@lukechilds yes when added this feature to GUI, were tested via both CLI and GUI multiple times. üôÇ
