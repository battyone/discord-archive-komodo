`rpcworkqueue` = the queue length for rpc work

[02-Jan-19 05:32 PM] wbradt#2043
So there is no rate limit on how many requests I can send to the network? i.e. Am I rate limited on how frequently I can create orders?

[02-Jan-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
one per second

Is this to prevent the network from being flooded? Or for something else?

[02-Jan-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
spam prevention can be enabled

[02-Jan-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just set on the minimum setting now but PoW for each packet can be changed with a #define

[02-Jan-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
also there are 14000+ different netids, each a totally independent networl

[02-Jan-19 05:52 PM] wbradt#2043
What do you mean by "PoW for each packet" @jl777c

[02-Jan-19 05:54 PM] wbradt#2043
Also, could you please tag me in responses if possible? I am using discord in browser so it's much easier to respond if I get a notification

[02-Jan-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@wbradt each packet would do some PoW to be valid

[02-Jan-19 05:57 PM] wbradt#2043
Sorry, I do not quite understand this. What PoW is being done? Doesn't PoW require computational resources? Whose are used? How is a packet "valid"--or rather how would one be invalid? @jl777c

[02-Jan-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
@wbradt each packet would do some PoW to be valid
any PoW that takes computational resources will force the sender to spend resources and thus make spam more expensive to do

[02-Jan-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
packet would be considered valid based on the PoW rules, whatever they are. I used the standard leading 0 bits

[02-Jan-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but it can be like txpow, generate txids until first and last bytes are 0, then it would limit to once per 20 seconds

[02-Jan-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so a bit too much PoW

[02-Jan-19 06:13 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, I understand. So is the POW constant for all users? So it takes less time for a node with a "faster" computer to create orders?

[02-Jan-19 06:15 PM] wbradt#2043
@jl777c ^

[02-Jan-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
@wbradt it would need to be a network wide rule. yes, faster nodes could make more orders

[02-Jan-19 06:30 PM] wbradt#2043
I think I may have misunderstood: Is requiring PoW to send a message (or "validate a packet") in place (or "a rule") on the main BarterDEX network? @jl777c

[02-Jan-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember i had it in place, but set it to minimum work, so it only takes a few millliseconds

[02-Jan-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not hard to add/change

[02-Jan-19 06:44 PM] wbradt#2043
Is the 1-second request limit in place? @jl777c

[02-Jan-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
each request needs a unique timestamp, which has 1 second resolution

[02-Jan-19 07:10 PM] wbradt#2043
Great. Thanks for the help.

[02-Jan-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
are you with some project @wbradt

[02-Jan-19 08:14 PM] wbradt#2043
Not really. I developed some market making algos last year 
 (https://github.com/wardbradt/peregrine) and was thinking of incorporating BarterDEX. I have more become generally interested in how BarterDEX works. @jl777c

[08-Jan-19 07:10 PM] wbradt#2043
Where in the ResDEX code are messages from other nodes processed?

@jl777c @artem.pikulin @artemciy_dice are any of you familiar with this: https://github.com/GuggerJoel/XMR-BTC-atomic/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf

Do you think it would be feasible to implement in mm?

I think the first practical BTC <-> XMR atomic swap implementation would be pretty big news.

I thought XMR needed more features added to be able to implement atomic swaps but this whitepaper seems to imply it can be achieved using just multisig on the XMR end.

[23-Jan-19 06:24 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Hi, I see this whitepaper 1st time. It looks similar to old swap protocol that was used in MM1, Hash/time locked txs on BTC side and multisig on XMR. It's possible to add/reimplement this in MM2, however there were no requests to add XMR previously.

[23-Jan-19 06:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, possibly for political reasons? Because Zcash and Monero are somewhat rivals and Komodo is a Zcash fork, Komodo members are more likely to be interested in Zcash as a privacy coin than Monero. So that could explain why there hasn't been much demand for Monero from within the Komodo community.

But I think this could be more of a publicity stunt that could bring a lot of attention from people outside of the current community. The Monero community has wanted atomic swaps with Bitcoin for a very long time. A working implementation of this that people can test out would be big news and hopefully get some well deserved publicity for Komodo.

[23-Jan-19 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
But I'm assuming it would be quite a bit of work to implement so obviously you'd need to weigh up if it's worth implementing over other stuff you're working on

[23-Jan-19 06:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, due to the private nature of Monero, it's very popular on decentralised exchanges, BTC/XMR is the highest volume pair on Bisq. It could bring in some much needed liquidity

[23-Jan-19 07:31 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I'm not involved in any political discussions. Didn't ever see that XMR is not allowed to be mentioned here. From developer point of view it's possible to integrate. However it might be hard to support different swap protocol for every coin. Also it might confuse the user, e.g. `Why do I need to have 2 BTC to sell only 1 for XMR?`.

[23-Jan-19 07:32 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
We can discuss it later if there's a demand from `users` to add XMR or any other coin.

[23-Jan-19 08:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I remember many people asking for XMR, also ptyx or someone else approached fluffypony but XMR devs were not interested to collaborate

[23-Jan-19 08:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

@cipi any suggestions?

[23-Jan-19 12:53 PM] cipi#4502
not really... besides making sure the config file has the same name as the datadir
`~/.electra/electra.conf` and not `~/.electra/Electra.conf` or something else...

[23-Jan-19 12:54 PM] cipi#4502
if the config file has the same name, confpath is not needed and everything works fine

[23-Jan-19 12:56 PM] cipi#4502
in Linux i made a symlink to correct this: `cd ~/.electra && ln -s electra.conf Electra.conf`

[23-Jan-19 12:56 PM] DRE#7875
@cipi where i can find electra.conf in barterdex

[23-Jan-19 12:57 PM] cipi#4502
electra.conf is the config file of the wallet... it is located in the datadir, where wallet.dat and blockchain-data is also located

[23-Jan-19 12:58 PM] cipi#4502
i would change the code of the daemon, so that the config file is named `electra.conf` and not `Electra.conf`

content looks good, but i would set a rpc password... not sure if it works without

[23-Jan-19 01:00 PM] DRE#7875
@cipi okay i will try i changed the name it was with big E

[23-Jan-19 01:00 PM] cipi#4502
if you just rename the file, it will not work, because the wallet expects the file to be named Electra.conf... this must be changed in the code

[23-Jan-19 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
rpcpassword needs to be defined if i remember correctly

[23-Jan-19 01:01 PM] DRE#7875
@cipi okay, because same file on Linux works fine

[23-Jan-19 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
coins/coins has
```JSON
"confpath": "USERHOME/.electra/Electra.conf"
```
so, I'm thinking `E` will be needed because js is case-sensitive, no?

[23-Jan-19 01:02 PM] DRE#7875
its normal, with big E

[23-Jan-19 01:02 PM] cipi#4502
yes, because confpath is evaluated correctly under Linux, but not in Windows

[23-Jan-19 01:03 PM] cipi#4502
but if the file is calles electra.conf, confpath can be removed

[23-Jan-19 01:03 PM] DRE#7875

this is in barterDex coin

[23-Jan-19 01:04 PM] cipi#4502
yes... if the wallet would use electra.conf, confpath can be removed from the barterdex config... it is the best solution

[23-Jan-19 01:06 PM] cipi#4502
i can also remove confpath from coin database for ECA and let the people deal with it... either the devs correct this in the code, or the users make symlinks

[23-Jan-19 01:06 PM] DRE#7875
So to understand, I change nothing in Electra folder and remove only the electra path in BarterDex coin?

[23-Jan-19 01:07 PM] cipi#4502
yes, if you remove confpath and the config file is called electra.conf, it will work... even under Windows

[23-Jan-19 01:08 PM] cipi#4502
`"name": "electra"` is the paramater that normally tells BarterDEX where to find the config
it is `~/.$name/$name.conf`

[23-Jan-19 01:10 PM] DRE#7875
thank you, sorry for my english,

so I changed the Electra.conf to electra.conf in appdata and now change the line "confpath" in BarterDex Coin: "USERHOME / .electra / Electra.conf" to "confpath": "

[23-Jan-19 01:10 PM] cipi#4502
remove the line confpath completely...

[23-Jan-19 01:11 PM] cipi#4502
but as i said: the wallet expects the file to be named Electra.conf... it must be either corrected in the source code of the wallet or you will have to make a symlink electra.conf -> Electra.conf

[23-Jan-19 01:13 PM] cipi#4502
or make a copy... so that you have 2 files with the same content, one named `electra.conf` and the other `Electra.conf`

[23-Jan-19 01:13 PM] cipi#4502
but best is to fix this in the source code of the wallet, so that it uses `electra.conf`

[23-Jan-19 01:15 PM] DRE#7875
cant create second Electra conf windows says its already available

[23-Jan-19 01:15 PM] DRE#7875
