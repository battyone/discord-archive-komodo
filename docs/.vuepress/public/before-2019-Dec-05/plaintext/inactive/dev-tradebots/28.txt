the bitcoin protocol atomic swap is pretty hard coded to use bitcoin script

[06-Sep-18 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
however it should be possible to create CC contract that implements schnorr signing

Thanks. I'll take a look at it

[06-Sep-18 02:18 PM] dan.#2473
Anyone notice on cmc -> pick a coin -> click `Get Wallet` links to atomicwallet.io. Do you guys think they paid cmc for this?

[06-Sep-18 02:19 PM] dan.#2473
the subtext for it is `The first wallet with atomic swaps.`

[06-Sep-18 02:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Of course it's paid ad

[10-Sep-18 07:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
does anyone have a tiny bit of VRSC they can send me to test HyperDEX integration?

[11-Sep-18 06:26 PM] PTYX#6840
question, how important are relay nodes to the sucess of an atomic swap

[11-Sep-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
they are only needed during ordermatch

[11-Sep-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
once the order is matched, then alice is connecting to the bob node directly

[11-Sep-18 06:37 PM] PTYX#6840
i was wondering if we could see how many are actually running

[11-Sep-18 06:37 PM] PTYX#6840
maybe we can add it to dexstats

Hi
I tried to make a swap on barterDEX today but it always timeout. Here is the result of recentswaps api:‚Ä®
```
{
    "result": "success",
    "swaps": [...],
    "netamounts": [...],
    "pending": {
        "expiration": 1536823121,
        "timeleft": 29,
        "tradeid": 991587069,
        "requestid": 0,
        "quoteid": 0,
        "bob": "COQUI",
        "base": "COQUI",
        "basevalue": 11.11135783,
        "alice": "BEER",
        "rel": "BEER",
        "relvalue": 23.88010012,
        "desthash": "c88a033b587244cd501e90709620c3ec58d9c3886e33c2e1db909d0451aa5833",
        "aliceid": "11469275510081323009"
    }
}
```
and after 60 seconds, there is empty in pending field and no swap is processing. Does anyone have an idea of what it happened and how to fix? Thanks

Hi @Nabob üëã  @namhoang28  had a question üëÜ  and I suggested he ask here.  Is it better to ask in support?

[13-Sep-18 09:50 AM] Mylo#8306
here should be good

[13-Sep-18 09:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @Mylo

[13-Sep-18 11:20 AM] Nabob#5004
request id and quote id says null for your previous swap, when placing order is it generated request id ?

[13-Sep-18 12:16 PM] luke#8628
Does BOTS (and other asset chains) have their own websites, or more information about how to get involved and how to use them (like how to subscribe to a bot that someone else made)? I see this: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/162234474/BOTS but it only has limited information.

[13-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
these assets are not being actively marketed

[13-Sep-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
anyone is free to start marketing, it is an open community

[18-Sep-18 06:01 PM] luke#8628
makes sense, thanks!

[19-Sep-18 05:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c For ACs can we change the `coin` param in coins.json or will it break stuff?

[19-Sep-18 05:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
I ask because we use the `coin` value to look up the fiat price and EQL have changed their ticker to EQLI

[19-Sep-18 05:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so I'm wondering if we can change:
```
        coin: 'EQL',
        name: 'Equaliser',
        asset: 'EQL',
        rpcport: 10306,
```
to
```
        coin: 'EQLI',
        name: 'Equaliser',
        asset: 'EQL',
        rpcport: 10306,
```

[19-Sep-18 05:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
or will that break stuff?

[19-Sep-18 05:06 PM] cipi#4502

Wow, wtf? The PAX stablecoin gives **admin write access** to law enforcement. Basically, the government can FREEZE and BURN anyone's coins!

Withdraw not available too ? ETH+ERC20

[22-Sep-18 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007

[22-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Andersen#8337
Tried today - did not work. I myself do not need. But I saw a lot of questions about this in the BTT. Not very good for reputation

[22-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Andersen#8337
Tried BNB

[22-Sep-18 06:05 PM] SHossain#0007
how did you try? which coins you had activated? do you have a screenshot?

[22-Sep-18 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@Andersen have you tried sending ETH or any other ERC20 token?

[22-Sep-18 06:23 PM] Andersen#8337
No just BNB

[22-Sep-18 06:23 PM] Andersen#8337
In BTT forum heard same  problem about ETH

[22-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Andersen#8337
today

[22-Sep-18 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
i can't reproduce with ETH or the other ERC20 tokens i have. they are working

[22-Sep-18 06:24 PM] SHossain#0007
if i get some BNB i can test that

[22-Sep-18 06:25 PM] Andersen#8337

could be issue at the end user side. unless, someone can reproduce this (if this is a bug). ETH/ERC20 side is still under development.

[22-Sep-18 06:31 PM] cipi#4502
could be the ETH balance is 0 ... is so, no ERC20 withdraws are possible because ERC20-transactions are paid with ETH

[22-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Andersen#8337
send   bnb       https://etherscan.io/address/0x012f7e74120d3d002e8f215ccc6f6f65618f00cb

[22-Sep-18 06:32 PM] Andersen#8337
yes my  ETH zero ,  but heard about ETH same troubles

[22-Sep-18 06:32 PM] cipi#4502
you need ETH to pay the txfees

[22-Sep-18 06:33 PM] cipi#4502
and if you want to withdraw ETH, you can't withdraw all, because of the same txfees

[22-Sep-18 06:33 PM] Andersen#8337
in other words  if ETH  empty   ERC20 cant move ?

[22-Sep-18 06:33 PM] cipi#4502
yes

[22-Sep-18 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to pay for txfee. for using ETH/ERC20 using BarterDEX, user need to have ETOMIC and ETH balance.

[22-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Andersen#8337
Etomic OK 199999  but ETH nothing .  Ill check little later

my usage of ETH and ERC20 tokens were only for testing. nothing in real life.
