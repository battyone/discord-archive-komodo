[10-Aug-18 01:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
you can see I definitely have credits

[10-Aug-18 01:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
I made a 2 week deposit

[10-Aug-18 01:49 PM] lukechilds#2707
can try 10 if you think it'll make a difference

[10-Aug-18 01:50 PM] lukechilds#2707
this is my deposit TX: https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/73be50a0364b8f2d14bdcf6b57b7b858c0e899307c0c8e520878fbbe16512fa2

[10-Aug-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
just trying to reduce the differences between our tests

[10-Aug-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok bob is ready

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
From the docs

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
>the values are 1 to 52 weeks and the amount (minimum of 10.0001).

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
then later on

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
>10.0001 KMD is min required for interest

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
can I do a deposit less than 10 KMD?

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
I just don't get interest?

[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
or it has to be over 10 KMD?

[10-Aug-18 02:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
running a little low on test KMD, would be good to just lock up 1 KMD for small test trades

[10-Aug-18 02:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
I sent you a refill to RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm

[10-Aug-18 02:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
@CHMEX awesome, thanks

[10-Aug-18 02:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c just noticed in that output above, ti has our trade in zdebits

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the zcredit/debits uses a conservative estimate, ie. it might assume you used up zcredits when you didnt as it is safer to do that than the other way around

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
ah ok

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
re

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
>ok bob is ready

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
what do you want me to do

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
try the buy again

[10-Aug-18 02:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
make a 10 week deposit and tr y again?

[10-Aug-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Aug-18 02:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok 👍

[10-Aug-18 02:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
from the docs

[10-Aug-18 02:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
>It can take few minutes (about 10 confirmations) for the LP nodes to recognise you.

[10-Aug-18 02:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
want me to wait 10 blocks after deposit before trading?

[10-Aug-18 02:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
Is there a fee for making a 0conf deposit

[10-Aug-18 02:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
Just noticed there are 3 outputs

[10-Aug-18 02:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
one to timelocked address, one change and one small one to an address I don't recognise

[10-Aug-18 02:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that a fee?

[10-Aug-18 02:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes its a fee for BOTS should be 0.1%

[10-Aug-18 02:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
ah

[10-Aug-18 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it also tags the address so we can find all 0conf deposits

[10-Aug-18 02:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
Is it possible to decode when its redeemable from the trx?

[10-Aug-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Aug-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810

[10-Aug-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
proof array is null

[10-Aug-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
apparently alice /Users/mac/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges/LP_instantdex.c:36:cJSON *LP_instantdex_txids(int32_t appendonly,char *coinaddr) is returning null array. you can do and instantdex claim so see what txids it is getting

[10-Aug-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
I see a 0conf now!

[10-Aug-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.0 bob.0, otheristrusted.1 othertrusts.1

[10-Aug-18 03:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yep looks like that one worked 🎉

[10-Aug-18 03:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
I got bobpayment before alicepayment was confirmed

[10-Aug-18 03:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
but alice spend still took quite a while

[10-Aug-18 03:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that expected?

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
alice is polling it not very quickly. I guess I can speed up the poll time for 0conf

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
fixing

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
that would be great

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
although we need Artems etomic builds for HyperDEX as we have ETH/ERC20 support

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
and I think he's away atm

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so won't be able to merge your changes in too quickly

[10-Aug-18 03:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so no rush for that

[10-Aug-18 03:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
so do you know what the issue is with 2 week deposits not being recognised but 10 week deposits are?

[10-Aug-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
proof":["73be50a0364b8f2d14bdcf6b57b7b858c0e899307c0c8e520878fbbe16512fa2", "a9be0b76d833b9684eb6a05daa4c2deaac7d9bb7faa7cd7e523c49d672cf3bc7"]

[10-Aug-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
I got both your depostis, so it seems the file tracking the deposit txids wasnt right for some reason

[10-Aug-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a fix that removes a 13 second pause for 0conf swaps!

[10-Aug-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
also I am able to trigger artem's build

[10-Aug-18 03:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh, great

[10-Aug-18 03:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
does that auto merge changes?

[10-Aug-18 03:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think it does actually

[10-Aug-18 03:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn, I can try again on a new address, it would be great if we can track down the issue with the deposit file

[10-Aug-18 03:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
we can't really ship it in HyperDEX until that's resolved, users won't be happy if they're locking up funds that don't give them zcredits

[10-Aug-18 03:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
I will try on a new address

[10-Aug-18 03:24 PM] lukechilds#2707
is it safe to make a deposit < 10 KMD?

[10-Aug-18 03:24 PM] lukechilds#2707
I know I won't get interest on them

[10-Aug-18 03:24 PM] lukechilds#2707
but I don't want to go locking up a load of 10 KMD deposits if I end up testing a lot of them

[10-Aug-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it will reject less than 10

[10-Aug-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i triggered an autobuild of artem's repo

[10-Aug-18 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also there are CONNECT.() and CONNECTED.() prints on alice and bob consoles

[10-Aug-18 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
inside is the proof:[] array which should just be the txids of the 0conf deposit(s)

[10-Aug-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
this way you can see that the other node is getting the proper info. the claim api call uses the same internal function as the proof:[] array so you should be able to use that to make sure the system knows about the 0conf txids

[10-Aug-18 03:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah that's what I've been doing

[10-Aug-18 03:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
`instantdex_claim`

[10-Aug-18 03:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
to check my own deposits

[10-Aug-18 03:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
will try another 2 week deposit on another address

[10-Aug-18 03:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
and if that doesn't get recognised try a 10 week and see if that clears it up

[10-Aug-18 03:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
is mm expected to work ok using multiple seed phrases btw?

[10-Aug-18 03:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
like if I log in with a new seed, is it going to se my old deposits in the file it uses to track the TXIDs and freak out?

[10-Aug-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt see the other address, each passphrase should create its own environment

[10-Aug-18 03:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, great

[10-Aug-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
artem's build is done

[10-Aug-18 03:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
perfect, testing now

[10-Aug-18 03:54 PM] cipi#4502
the last 2 builds don't contain a linux binary, only OSX and a strange OS called win :-D
intention or something broken?

[10-Aug-18 04:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
I just noticed that too

[10-Aug-18 04:15 PM] cipi#4502
https://travis-ci.org/artemii235/SuperNET
shows some strange stuff
`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/artemii235/cpp-ethereum.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.`
wondering why it works for the OSX build... would expect that this part is the same for all OSes

[10-Aug-18 04:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c Tried again with a 2 week deposit on a new address and it failed

[10-Aug-18 04:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
so seems like the issue is reproducable

[10-Aug-18 04:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
(by failed I mean Bob can't see my zcredits)

[10-Aug-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, if 10 weeks works, lets set a min time of 10 weeks for now

[10-Aug-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
that's quite a long time

[10-Aug-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not sure many people will be open to tie funds up for that long

[10-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
I will try another 2 week deposit

[10-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
see if just making a second deposit is what resolves the issue

[10-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
then I will try 4 weeks

[10-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
That a nice amoutn, roughly a month and I think most people would go for that
