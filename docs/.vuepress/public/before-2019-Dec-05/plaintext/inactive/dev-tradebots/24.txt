btw, any chance you can use your key to return some of the deposits to me?

[10-Aug-18 04:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
otherwise I'm gonna have to lock up a lot of funds across a lot of addresses to test this

[10-Aug-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt an easy automated process. I can just send you KMD for testing

[10-Aug-18 05:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, thanks

[10-Aug-18 05:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
are you able to send some to `RKTCwkMM6Jf92YkXWkoQ3xG5eKThLSVXHN`

[10-Aug-18 05:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
I just did another 2 week deposit and that didn't work either

[10-Aug-18 05:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
so it definitely appears to be the length of the deposit that gets all of your zcredits recognised

[10-Aug-18 05:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
not the act of making a second deposit

[10-Aug-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefuly bc89e424265a4d9455748bfa9b967b9dec64125463214b0d8ff5f6c4fd7daacf is enough, if not, let me know

[10-Aug-18 05:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
cheers

[10-Aug-18 05:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
hehe, got muddled up with the outputs and thought you sent 26356 for a sec!

[14-Aug-18 06:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
is there anywhere I can read about the gtc changes

[14-Aug-18 06:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think I just need to add `{gtc: 1}` to the JSON

[14-Aug-18 06:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
but is there anywhere I can read on how it affects the behaviour

[14-Aug-18 06:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think it appends the ID in `ccccc` or something right?

[14-Aug-18 06:34 PM] lukechilds#2707
didn't see it mentioned here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/BarterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category

yes, gtc:1 to JSON and then it will loop on the request every 5 minutes until cancelled

[14-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also a fill flag that can make it accept partial fills or only complete fills

[14-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
a gtc order will stop even with a partial fill

[14-Aug-18 06:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
I see

[14-Aug-18 06:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
would be cool if there was an option to try and fill the remainding amount after a partial fill

[14-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it sets the first chars of the uuid with gtc, or something like that

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I leave that to the GUI

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
and when it re-issues the order every 5 mins

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
will it have a new UUID

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
or re-use the same UUID?

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the same trade as far as mm is conceerened

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
perfect

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
yep, that makes it a lot easier on our end too

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
now this hasnt been thoroughly validated as far as uuid permanence, so might be bugs

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
what do you mean by UUID permanence

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
oh, that it reuses the UUID

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
gotcha

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[14-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
will test

[14-Aug-18 06:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks üëç

[14-Aug-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and gtc is for that session

[14-Aug-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
a restart and it is all gone

[14-Aug-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
unless DB/SWAP files were created from a swap

[14-Aug-18 07:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, we will be saving them in our DB, so they will still be there in the UI

[14-Aug-18 07:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
and the user would probably be expecting them to resume next time they open the UI

[14-Aug-18 07:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
I guess we can re issue the gtc order

[14-Aug-18 07:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
can we pass in an id

[14-Aug-18 07:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
like we could with normal orders

[14-Aug-18 07:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so we pass in the gtc id from the last session

[14-Aug-18 07:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so if it matches all the socket messages will match the id we have internally

[14-Aug-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes if you pass in a uuid, it will use that

[14-Aug-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this is for all orders

[14-Aug-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think

[15-Aug-18 04:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
where should I report generic mm bugs?

[15-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c on your repo or artems?

[15-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
if they are related to general behaviour

[15-Aug-18 04:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
e.g withdrawing currency, not etomic specific

[15-Aug-18 05:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
James I made a gtc order on my Alice

[15-Aug-18 05:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
looked to all be working

[15-Aug-18 05:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
I could see it re-issueing every 5 mins

[15-Aug-18 05:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
however when I offer up a matching order on my Bob it doesn't seem to match

[15-Aug-18 05:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
it does do something

[15-Aug-18 05:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the trade doesn't seem to start

```

[15-Aug-18 05:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
it basically just repeats that last block (from `request  MYTH/KMD` to  `reserved  MYTH/KMD`) every 5 minutes

[15-Aug-18 05:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
after each order is issued from Alice

[15-Aug-18 05:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
(those logs are from Bob)

[15-Aug-18 05:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the trade never seems to actually execute

[15-Aug-18 05:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
Does `reserved  MYTH/KMD` mean Bob has reserved the order for himself?

[15-Aug-18 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it got the reserved, but maybe the price was fractionally not enough?

[15-Aug-18 06:34 PM] lukechilds#2707
Bob wants 0.1

[15-Aug-18 06:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
I set Alice's price to 0.15

[15-Aug-18 06:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think it normally gives a message in the logs if the prices don't match

[15-Aug-18 06:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
wait a sec

[15-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
just got back from dinner and it appears to have gone through

[15-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
odd

[15-Aug-18 06:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
it took about 4-5 of those request/reserved blocks before it matched

[15-Aug-18 06:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
normally when I'm not using gtc it matches instantly

[15-Aug-18 06:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
this seems to take 4-5 of the re-orders before it matched

[15-Aug-18 06:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
even though it saw all of them and got to reserved state

[15-Aug-18 06:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, it appears there is a bug with the IDs

[15-Aug-18 06:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
The `marketmaker` response when alice placed the order said the UUID is: `6194b5e826a4ba650d4c6f37d343763a7e8943db0239d0a085d1436f5d702fa7 `

[15-Aug-18 06:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
However from Bobs end the logs show the UUID as `6194b5e826a4ba650d4c6f37d343763a7e8943db0239d0a085d1436f5dcccccc`

[15-Aug-18 06:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
we didn't get any events in the UI

[15-Aug-18 06:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
presumably because it was listening for the UUID it was given from mm but the socket messages contained the one ending in `cccccc`

[15-Aug-18 06:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
what's the reason for replacing the last 6 characters with `c`?

[15-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the uuid is changed to have the  cccccc after it is sent as an event

[15-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a signal that it is a gtc order

[15-Aug-18 06:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
would it be possible to either use the normal ID all the time, or if there is a reason it needs to end in `cccccc` make sure it's returned like that in the original order request?

[15-Aug-18 06:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
could gtc orders not be signalled with an extra property or something

[15-Aug-18 06:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
like gtc:1 in the order

[15-Aug-18 06:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
it doesn't seem like a good idea to hack meaningful info into something that's supposed to be a unique identifier

[15-Aug-18 06:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, why do gtc orders need to be signalled

[15-Aug-18 06:45 PM] lukechilds#2707
will they ever be treated differently to a normal order?

[15-Aug-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, bob treats them differently, but I can remove the cccccc

[15-Aug-18 06:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks, that would be great üëå

[15-Aug-18 06:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, any ideas on why it took so long to match?

[15-Aug-18 06:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
it had to be re-broadcast about 5 times before the bob decided to swap

[15-Aug-18 06:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
but the Bob noticed it each time before, just didn't swap

[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
updated my repo, will trigger build in artem's when it propagates

[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea why 5 times

[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] lukechilds#2707
awesome thanks
