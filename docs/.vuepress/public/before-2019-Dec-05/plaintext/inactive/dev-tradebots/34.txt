what is `iguana/DB/GTC/orders`?

[20-Nov-18 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
GTC = Good Till Cancelled

[20-Nov-18 09:32 PM] wbradt#2043
Yes

[20-Nov-18 09:32 PM] wbradt#2043
When is data for an order put in the file?

[20-Nov-18 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
when bob or alice use `gtc=1` or `fill=1` in their order, that dir gets used

[20-Nov-18 09:37 PM] SHossain#0007
but, that is not widely used param

[20-Nov-18 09:41 PM] wbradt#2043
Which method can bob use that param in?

[20-Nov-18 09:46 PM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice` or `setprice`

[20-Nov-18 09:54 PM] wbradt#2043
Yesterday you said that `autoprice` has an `amount` field. Is that true for only `autoprice` and not `setprice`?

[20-Nov-18 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007
for both

[20-Nov-18 09:55 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks

[20-Nov-18 09:56 PM] wbradt#2043
So, using `amount`, bob can place a limit order for a certain amount at a certain price?

[20-Nov-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[20-Nov-18 10:05 PM] wbradt#2043
Great.

[21-Nov-18 04:42 AM] ph03nix#3115
does barterdex still get price feed from cmc?

[21-Nov-18 04:43 AM] ph03nix#3115
i guess a better question is, where does the price feed come from?

[21-Nov-18 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
CMC changed to a paid plan, so the pricefeed shouldnt be used. you should generate your own pricefeed and set prices for bob

[21-Nov-18 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as amount goes, i dont remember adding amount restrictions explicitly for bob. the available utxo implicitly limits the amount

[21-Nov-18 08:16 AM] ph03nix#3115
`CMC changed to a paid plan`

[21-Nov-18 08:16 AM] ph03nix#3115
yes, so i was going to suggest https://api.coinpaprika.com/

[21-Nov-18 08:54 AM] ph03nix#3115
maybe there are other free ones

[21-Nov-18 08:55 AM] ph03nix#3115
this one is new to me and seems legit

@jl777c i just realized I missed an `extern CCerror`, sorry about that

[21-Nov-18 04:15 PM] wbradt#2043
@SHossain Using `"amount"` in `setprice` didn't seem to work. I also couldn't find any references to `"amount"` in the code for`setprice`

did the `amount` param worked in `autoprice` script?

[21-Nov-18 04:26 PM] wbradt#2043
I haven't tried it

[21-Nov-18 04:27 PM] wbradt#2043
How do I use `autoprice` to place an order at a price that doesn't change?

[21-Nov-18 04:36 PM] SHossain#0007
```JSON
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"BEER\",\"fixed\":0.4}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"autoprice\",\"base\":\"BEER\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"fixed\":100}"
```

[21-Nov-18 04:38 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can't set amount, just keep the amount you want to trade in the barterDEX address and send the rest to main account. in any circumstances, using main account for barterDEX is not recommended. always better to create a separate address for trading.

[21-Nov-18 05:03 PM] tolken#2655
@SHossain I would have sworn James stated you couldn‚Äôt set a limit/amount for bobs, unfortunately. A mm2 thing.

thanks @tolken

[21-Nov-18 05:07 PM] tolken#2655
It would be a very powerful addition though, to have a min/max. Btc will generally require larger UTXOs, so it would be nice to just prevent 1kmd trades against btc before swap even starts, even if there is an appropriately sized btc UTXO.

[26-Nov-18 02:53 PM] wbradt#2043
I am not sure if this is the right channel to ask: is there any self-trade prevention in BarterDEX?

[26-Nov-18 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

maybe you can follow the code to see what it does then

The only usage it has is at this line: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_prices.c#L827 I believe the rest of the body of `HASH_ITER` (lines 832-851) simply adds an `LP_orderbookentry` to the asks or bids array. But I can't figure out the significance of `timestamp` of `LP_pubkey_info`

@jl777c I have a question about the alice order types that you mention at https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/449948412960440352/460433104301981696. I was under the impression that an alice order can result in only one trade. What is the difference between `fill:0` and `fill:1`?

[06-Dec-18 03:06 PM] wbradt#2043
And, to make sure I understand, IOC orders (`fill:0 gtc:0`) are not _immediate_, but cancel after one minute, or the "typical blocktime"?

[06-Dec-18 03:07 PM] wbradt#2043
So the effect is that an IOC order can only match with orders placed before it?

[06-Dec-18 03:10 PM] wbradt#2043
And what would be the effect of `gtc` on a `dump` or `fomo` order? Would `fill` work for these?

[06-Dec-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
gtc would just keep issuing it till it got some sort of fill

[06-Dec-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if i tested fill on a dump or fomo, but i dont see why it would behave differently, their purpose is to autocalculate a price field

[06-Dec-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but it could be an edge case bug

[06-Dec-18 03:49 PM] wbradt#2043
So did I get "IOC" orders correct? "IOC orders (fill:0 gtc:0) are not immediate, but cancel after one minute, or the "typical blocktime"?"

[06-Dec-18 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Dec-18 09:59 PM] wbradt#2043
Was I right about "So the effect is that an IOC order can only match with orders placed before it?"

[06-Dec-18 10:00 PM] wbradt#2043
So an IOC order cannot match with another order placed 10 seconds after it?

[06-Dec-18 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it could, but not likely

Is there any reason intrinsic to atomic swaps for why the trader using 212% is the liquidity provider?

[13-Dec-18 11:27 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Hi, the swap protocol was designed at 2015-2016 when only few coins implemented BIP65 (CLTV opcode support). This approach allows 1 side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig payment without timelock. Nowadays it's not really necessary as most coins seem to catch up and implement BIP65. According to this we will use simpler symmetric protocol version (both payments are CLTV) in MM2 so LP side won't need to have 212% balance anymore

[13-Dec-18 07:31 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks! @artem.pikulin very informative

[13-Dec-18 07:34 PM] wbradt#2043
The docs say `recentswaps` "returns up to "limit" in reverse order the swaps on the node and the current pending swap (if any) so you can see what trade might happen." Does this mean it returns only swaps in which I have participated?

[13-Dec-18 07:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes

[14-Dec-18 01:22 AM] tolken#2655

[14-Dec-18 02:58 PM] wbradt#2043
@artem.pikulin So in MM2 would both sides of the trade need only 100%? Or does alice still pay dexfee? Or some other arrangement?

[14-Dec-18 03:00 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Alice will have to pay small dexfee = 1/777 of trading amount as it was previously.

[14-Dec-18 03:01 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks--does bob then pay 100%?

[14-Dec-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i think bob might need to also pay 1/777

[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
In current implementation Bob does not pay any fee except standard transaction commission. So the protocol is (Bitcoin script example):
1. A fee, p2pkh output: `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 FEE_RMD160 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`
2. B payment: 
```
OP_IF
<now + LOCKTIME*2> OP_CLTV OP_DROP <bob_pubB0> OP_CHECKSIG
 OP_ELSE
OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_HASH160 <hash(bob_privN)> OP_EQUALVERIFY <alice_pubA0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```
3. A payment:
```
OP_IF
<now + LOCKTIME> OP_CLTV OP_DROP <alice_pubA0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_HASH160 <hash(bob_privN)> OP_EQUALVERIFY <bob_pubB0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```
It's actually not hard to add Bfee as work is in progress.

[14-Dec-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`Bob does not pay any fee except standard transaction commission.`
So, no deposit anymore? at all?

[14-Dec-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there would need to be something at stake for bob, so lets add the 1/777 fee to bobside also

[14-Dec-18 03:16 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Is it really required? There is always a case when someone loses fee if other side does not follow the protocol. Bob side didn't require a fee and it's introduced as liquidity provider advantage

[14-Dec-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
are you sure bob cant get an advantage without a dexfee?

[14-Dec-18 03:18 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ Yes, no need for Bob deposit anymore.

[14-Dec-18 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I'd think that the "need" would be to not be able to screw Alice out of dex fees for the cost of 0.0001 CoinX

[14-Dec-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
oh, you mean that whole stage is gone?

[14-Dec-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
sweet

[14-Dec-18 03:21 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
I mean that Bob did not have to pay fee previously, it's a bonus for being the liquidity provider. It's usual for marketmaker to pay less fees or not pay these at all.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[14-Dec-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but if nobody is putting up liquidity anymore, then without dexfee, it seems bad things can happen

[14-Dec-18 03:22 PM] wbradt#2043
I think bob not paying a transaction fee would be ideal, as it provides the incentive to make liquidity.
