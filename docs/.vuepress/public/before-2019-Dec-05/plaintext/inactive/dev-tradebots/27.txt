@jl777c did you get a chance to take a look at that issue?

Trying to sell 58.42 DEX and 1.79 SuperNET on barterdex with no luck for a long time.  If anybody is interested in buying them OTC please let me know.  I'll sell cheaper than highest bid on barterdex.

[21-Aug-18 04:26 PM] ranfoltu#0306
CHMEX offered me 510 KMD for the entire lot.  Thanks for that offer.  I'll sell to him unless anybody wants to offer more..

[23-Aug-18 05:01 PM] ranfoltu#0306

"*post your address in #dev-tradebots for free BEER*" (bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg29117192#msg29117192).

I need free BEER to test the MM2 (in the context of issue 116, I want the test to touch the autopricing code, hopefully it does that for BEER / PIZZA).

`calcaddress` gives me `... "pubsecp":"024fa4b54ec092652adccf5dc458a99b110bc19964852fd08526a5509c4ada9549","coinaddr":"RFf5mf3AoixXzmNLAmgs2L5eWGveSo6X7q","p2shaddr":"bK7APNVNZEYSSbrVnG1q9TtKEtNEEunXii" ...`, which of these I need to share to get some BEER?

yes, also saw `error waiting for alicepayment`... was a bit confused at first because there was a "SWAP completed" message in between... pretty sure it was a previous BCH swap that got completed because a new block was finally mined

i think that was something with the txfees... BCH uses a fixed fee `0.00001000 BCH`... but in this case it simply took so long for a new block
@jl777c how long does alice wait for bobdeposit to be mined? Sorry, but i forgot this...

@cipi  If I create a fork of Cardano with these RPC calls will then it be possible to add atomic swaps?

i don't know Cardano, so i don't know if it is possible to do that, but sure, you could try 😃

[06-Sep-18 03:33 AM] mark#1011
@jl777c I asked this question in the dev channel and was referred to you:

Is anyone here familiar with Schnorr signatures? I have an atomic swap that uses adaptor signatures (involving key and signature aggregation) in lieu of traditional bitcoin-style scripts and I would like to integrate the new technique into the codebase. Would like to chat with the relevant dev if possible

[06-Sep-18 03:35 AM] mark#1011
I'm afraid I don't know a terrible amount about KMD yet, but if you guys support Schnorr, I'd like to help implement a scriptless swap with you. If not, I'd be interested in at least adding scriptless swaps between Schnorr coins on barterdex
