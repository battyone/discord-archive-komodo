those values are illusional

@tolken If we agree that you give me 5 grapes for my two oranges, we can't complete our deal if you only have 4.8 grapes

[08-Jul-18 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
never to trust them, but to use as a means of reference

[08-Jul-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
max vol, avg vol are not 100% accurate

[08-Jul-18 05:39 PM] tolken#2655
I can trade virtually any assetchain effortlessly it seems

[08-Jul-18 05:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`address_myutxopair couldn't find` is a literal thing, it may be due to SPV lag or usage or locking to a 2nd offer, or a number of things

[08-Jul-18 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mm is telling you that it can't find the proper UTXOs to complete your side of the swap

[08-Jul-18 05:40 PM] tolken#2655
Why is it complaining about ltc utxos?

[08-Jul-18 05:41 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm buying ltc, not selling ltc.

[08-Jul-18 05:41 PM] tolken#2655
As Alice

[08-Jul-18 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@tolken is RBs52D7pVq7txo6SCz1Tuyw2WrPmdqU3qw your KMD addy?

[08-Jul-18 05:43 PM] tolken#2655
Yep

[08-Jul-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what was the timeframe difference between you buying BCH and trying to buy LTC?

[08-Jul-18 05:46 PM] tolken#2655
bch, im not clear on why those are still there, must may be some pendings bob trades from yesterday, still waiting on Alice payments. Ltc/kmd Alice buy attempts as recently as an hour or so ago.

[08-Jul-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
in the GUI, you had KMD on top or bottom?

[08-Jul-18 05:49 PM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt use GUI anymore really.

[08-Jul-18 05:49 PM] tolken#2655
This is all for my marketmaker, I just test Alice trades from time to time to make sure it‚Äôs alive.

[08-Jul-18 05:53 PM] tolken#2655
@SHossain is maxvol really that inaccurate? I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs inaccurate only in that it‚Äôs potentially out of date. Why else would it be an illusion?

[08-Jul-18 05:53 PM] SHossain#0007
those data are not most up to date

[08-Jul-18 05:54 PM] SHossain#0007
anything can happen. any of the utxo can get locked any time for other swaps. check explorer with bob address for utxos

[08-Jul-18 05:54 PM] SHossain#0007
you will find the sizes

[08-Jul-18 05:56 PM] tolken#2655
Yep, I bet they‚Äôre there too. I‚Äôll check. I highly doubt that‚Äôs the issue here

[08-Jul-18 05:57 PM] tolken#2655
@SHossain any idea how to diagnose why it‚Äôs complaining about my ltc UTXOs when I‚Äôm attempting to buy ltc?

[08-Jul-18 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
best to use separate netid

[08-Jul-18 05:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you can test in controlled environment with only your bob

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] SHossain#0007
are your bobs running all coins in native mode?

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] SHossain#0007
how many utxo your bob's has for each coin?

[08-Jul-18 05:59 PM] tolken#2655
Separate netid? Just to do an Alice buy of LTC using my KMD from someone else‚Äôs LTC/KMD bob?

[08-Jul-18 06:00 PM] SHossain#0007
what are the utxo sizes?

[08-Jul-18 06:00 PM] tolken#2655
I have about 22 UTXOs of kmd, ranging from around 1kmd , some 65, 77... maybe some larger.

[08-Jul-18 06:01 PM] tolken#2655
Only a few ltc, but they shouldn‚Äôt be a factor here, im not selling ltc. I‚Äôm not attempting to buy anything using ltc.

[08-Jul-18 06:01 PM] tolken#2655
The errors posted above is BarterDex complaining about my ltc UTXOs. Which makes very little sense to me.

have you tried testing with PIZZA/BEER pair only?

[08-Jul-18 06:05 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm not attempting to do private trades. Do you think that‚Äôs possibly the problem? My Alice is trying to trade with my bob? Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening

[08-Jul-18 06:06 PM] tolken#2655
but I don‚Äôt understand why BarterDex isn‚Äôt trying to match with others if that‚Äôs the case. I have a very high bid, and I have even left it on with gtc

[08-Jul-18 06:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not telling you to do private trade. if you want to know what is going on and want to troubleshoot, it is better to isolate your bob and alice from the default netid.

[08-Jul-18 06:07 PM] SHossain#0007
it is always better to test with BEER/PIZZA first. you don't loose funds but gain experience

[08-Jul-18 06:07 PM] tolken#2655
But if I isolate it, who am I going to buy from? I have already successfully traded on this configuration, bobs and Alice trades.

[08-Jul-18 06:08 PM] SHossain#0007
there could be a lot of issues. utxo, network, spv (if running)...etc

[08-Jul-18 06:08 PM] tolken#2655
I have done many trades... I have btc, kmd, bch, ltc successful bob and Alice trades.

[08-Jul-18 06:08 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to setup your bob in a VPS and buy from that

[08-Jul-18 06:08 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm not using spv

[08-Jul-18 06:08 PM] tolken#2655
All native

[08-Jul-18 06:11 PM] tolken#2655
I can isolate, and I‚Äôd be willing to do that if it would help you guys, but I just want to be clear, I have primed the pipes and have had this stuff working more or less. I just don‚Äôt want to go to the trouble of setting up yet another configuration without first knowing what information would be useful to look out for to aid  devs. I can isolate without using VPS.

[08-Jul-18 06:15 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm going to try disabling my autoprice on my ltc/kmd bob, see if there‚Äôs some conflict there

[08-Jul-18 06:18 PM] tolken#2655
Nevermind, I didn‚Äôt have an ltc/kmd bob... so I‚Äôm stumped.

[08-Jul-18 06:24 PM] tolken#2655
Interesting note, I notice that even after purging the orders from gtc dB folder; subsequent Alice orders get added to there, even though they were gtc 0. Is that the right behavior?

[08-Jul-18 06:30 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, so trades that are gtc 0 get added to ‚Äúorders‚Äù in DB, gtc 1 doesn‚Äôt get added.

but the transaction can be fetched from the electrums

[09-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Who is trading LTC for ETOMIC?

[09-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Of is this LTC <-> ERC20 with the ETOMIC in between?

[09-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm doesnt show any txid's

[09-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I assume it's someone just playing around

[09-Jul-18 03:50 PM] Mylo#8306
likely ERC20 with the ETOMIC placeholder there on the atomic swap info side of things.
The ETOMIC is there to match UTXOs on the bitcoin-protocol side and to be used in the smart contract for the eth side of swap.
so yes, LTC <-----> ETOMIC+ERC20/ETH

It's down to the team's opinion on how they're going to use them, but I think it's best practice to leave @ everyone tags for things like critical security vulnerabilities and such

Maybe server wide relevant announcements where you want maximum exposure, but never in a side channel for some sub-project
