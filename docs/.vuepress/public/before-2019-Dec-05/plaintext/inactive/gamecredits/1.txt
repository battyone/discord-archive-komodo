Komodo team: we know you are so busy in Komodo, but I’m curious if you’d be interested in helping us out. Long story short: we are creating a GameCredits Foundation to break away from GNation, who is neglecting blockchain development. And we’re looking for people to join and help us out, mostly as volunteers to begin with the possibility of pay in the future. If you’re interested, I will share your name with Nele from GameCredits - the guy who is pushing to get one set up. Even if we can just get a few official Komodo folks backing (no money necessary) we have a chance to show GNation that crypto is with us and we can secure funding from them. You guys would not be the only supporters, a lot of old time GameCredits guys are backing us up as well as community

[16-Jul-18 01:28 AM] Mylo#8306
Interesting.  I'm a komodo noob in contrast to some in the team/community but am curious as to the Foundation you're creating.
 - what are the goals?
 - is there a charter/manifesto/vision paper?
 - will it be for-profit/non-profit?
 - will it have an entity and if so what jurisdiction/country?

[16-Jul-18 04:35 PM] n64#7103
Goals: to build the ecosystem that was promised to investors. Something GNation doesn’t care about. The original vision. Charter: not yet, but you can be sure we have one in progress. Likely non-profit, just building the ecosystem. Based in Serbia where the blockchain devs are

[16-Jul-18 04:35 PM] n64#7103

Maybe you could redeploy gamecredits in an assetchain and take advantage of all the smart contracts being built in #cc-general You guys could even develop your own contracts.

[26-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Mylo#8306
serge has promised scaling, if your blockchain isn't scaling, may as well do it on komodo and keep your community from getting the pitchforks, but it depends on your "game" side of the projects too.

just an FYI to all... Jack Kuveke of the former joint venture between GC and GNation is doing an AMA to expose the fraud of GNation management, specifically in regards to the MGO ICO. Since we are separating from them, the community needs to know this (especially those that invested in MGO). https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/92xa4t/jack_kuveke_former_volunteer_communications/

@jl777c is there anything functionally different in a kmd notary integration between 0.15.1 and 0.16? Komodo validation.h is version 0.15....exploring this before we begin upgrading GAME

[13-Sep-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
there are bitcoin core syntax changes that seem to have been added just to break other coins, identical functionality just with different syntax

got it, thank you

[17-Sep-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
today we found a bug that appears to be able to in some cases require 2 notarizations for full protection. We are still not 100% sure the exact impact, but with 2 notarizations it appears to be not an issue at all and since the exchanges are using N confirms such that it is getting more than 1 notarization, the risk appears to be small.

we have an early fix that has tested out to resist this attack scenario, but it is not clear yet if it will be a hardforking change or not as things are in the unexpected territory. Also, there might be secondary issues that we will also find and fix after we test the patch more.

I wanted to let you know so you are aware. 

tl:dr Our internal abusing testing found some cases that require 2 notarizations, and we are evaluating the impact of the patch

there is a small chance attacker can split the network if they are running different versions. you could height activate the check to being a few weeks in the future

[24-Sep-18 07:00 PM] n64#7103
ok, to confirm placement:
```    CBlock& block = *pblock;
    if (!ReadBlockFromDisk(block, pindexDelete, chainparams.GetConsensus()))
        return AbortNode(state, "Failed to read block");
    // Apply the block atomically to the chain state.
    // Komodo fix
    { 
        int32_t prevMoMheight; 
        uint256 notarizedhash,txid; 
        komodo_notarized_height(&prevMoMheight,&notarizedhash,&txid); 
        if ( block.GetHash() == notarizedhash ) { 
            fprintf(stderr,"DisconnectTip trying to disconnect notarized block at ht.%d\n",(int32_t)pindexDelete->nHeight); 
            return(false); 
        } 
    }
    
    int64_t nStart = GetTimeMicros();
    {
        CCoinsViewCache view(pcoinsTip);```

[24-Sep-18 07:00 PM] n64#7103
i'll take a look at height activation to ensure its done properly

[24-Sep-18 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes that looks good

[24-Sep-18 07:06 PM] n64#7103
and if i read the code correctly, activating it this way should be sufficient.
```if ( (block.GetHash() == notarizedhash) && (pindexDelete->nHeight > 2177400)) { 
            fprintf(stderr,"DisconnectTip trying to disconnect notarized block at ht.%d\n",(int32_t)pindexDelete->nHeight); 
            return(false); 
        } ```

[24-Sep-18 07:07 PM] n64#7103
until block height 2177400 it won't cause any trouble... after that it should be active

[24-Sep-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, more efficient to do it at the highest level as no point in calling the other things before that height, but either works

[24-Sep-18 07:09 PM] n64#7103
got it. then, if i do it this way, would it work? not primarily a c++ guy so i'm not sure what effect itll have if i write it this way. i used the curly braces from the code snippet you provided and turned it into an if statement.

```// Komodo fix
    if(pindexDelete->nHeight > 2177400) { 
        int32_t prevMoMheight; 
        uint256 notarizedhash,txid; 
        komodo_notarized_height(&prevMoMheight,&notarizedhash,&txid); 
        if ( block.GetHash() == notarizedhash) { 
            fprintf(stderr,"DisconnectTip trying to disconnect notarized block at ht.%d\n",(int32_t)pindexDelete->nHeight); 
            return(false); 
        } 
    }```

[24-Sep-18 07:10 PM] n64#7103
sorry for being a bit of a noob when it comes to c++ and syntax

[24-Sep-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, until 2177400 it wont do anything

[24-Sep-18 07:12 PM] n64#7103

jl777 I want to learn crypto conditions as I’m considering to launch an esports token on Komodo. The idea is to airdrop to existing GAME users to initially seed the token out. where do I start to learn about cc?

Komodo 👍 

[11-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Mihailo#5902
@n64 From my understanding by now of the whole system, I think you should focus on Assets CC. You can tokenize KDM coin into whatever token you name it (with ratio of 1 KDM= 100mil tokens, so if you do not need satoshis for tokens then 1 KMD  gets more than enough tokens) and give it to GAME users. Ofc, I suppose you want to integrate the token in some eSports games/system so they should integrate at least usage of RPC for assets CC in order to be able to send/receive tokens with players.

[12-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
many ways to do this

[12-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a new coin that is airdropped and has CC enabled would give that the most power

[12-Oct-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but if all you need to do are things tokens can do, you can have a single new chain that the tokens are made on

[12-Oct-18 10:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c  I think @n64 does not want to have a new chain and need to have mining and etc. If I understood correctly he just needs the token which could be used for esports purpose. So I think it is best to create a token on KMD chain, correct me if I'm wrong.

[12-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD wont support ac until next year's hardfork, so one of the existing ac_cc chains would be needed to be used

[12-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
BTCH is looking for new usecases

[12-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, but CC works on KMD now or not?

[12-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt active yet

[12-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not on KMD itself, want to make sure it is validated fully first

[12-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ahh, ok. So then on some asset chain that is active...

[12-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
next hardrfork to update notaries is when I expect it to go active

[12-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, much safer to put such cutting edge tech on the smaller chains

[12-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean we think it is solid, but only way to know something is ready for field deployment is a smaller field deployment

[16-Oct-18 06:37 PM] n64#7103
I’m definitely interested in the following 2 options for the future of game:
1) a gateway where users can swap game for game(kmd) and back, allowing users to use crypto conditions

[16-Oct-18 06:37 PM] n64#7103
2) a possible airdrop for existing game holders

[16-Oct-18 06:38 PM] n64#7103
option 1 is still preferred, but possibly with some “bonuses” if those users held game at a certain block height

[16-Oct-18 06:38 PM] n64#7103
the reason 1 is preferred is because exchanges will likely not add GAMEkmd for a while to come, especially since we have no funding at all

[16-Oct-18 06:39 PM] n64#7103
does an assetchain have to be mined or can it act like an erc20 token does: eg where there’s no mining and blocks depend on the parent chain?

[16-Oct-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you will be able to have a CPU minable coin

[16-Oct-18 07:11 PM] n64#7103
I think it would be great to test this out. Iirc 1 kmd can get me up to 100 mil of an assetchain issued... the tough part is a gateway to swap back and forth

[16-Oct-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we are testing gateways CC now that automatically (mostly) binds an external coin to a token

[16-Oct-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
once that works, we will extend it to use the native coin instead of a token

[16-Oct-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then we get a 1:1 two way pegged chain

[16-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this chain shouldnt be mining any significant number of new coins as they would be able to be converted to the external coin (GAME)

[16-Oct-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but if a little dilution is ok, then some small per block reward like 0.0001 would at least motivate CPU mining
