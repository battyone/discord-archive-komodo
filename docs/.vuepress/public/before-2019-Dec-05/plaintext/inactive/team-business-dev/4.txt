Yeah I think that's the main thing. Important to think about a reason why LABS would have value.

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Alright#0419
We see it as a vital resource for contract devs. Something we *need* as an ecosystem. We're still hashing out the specifics of emissions, incentives, general game theory

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My gut feeling would be to make it 1M premine locked up somehow, that can be bought with kmd or whatever by people that want something tested

[23-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That way the devs being paid in LABS know it is backed by something

[23-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And will be incentivized that way to do the tests/work

[23-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand

[23-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
please stop by #kmdlabs and explain your ideas

[23-Nov-18 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
Think about what gives BTC value. Work, yes?

[23-Nov-18 12:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I one thing thought LABS would do was allow incentivised testing, with bounties paid for bug fix etc. 
Project seeking testing buys some LABS for paying bounties, and users earn LABS for testing whatever they want tested

[23-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah if a project needed to buy LABS then my arguments are invalid, but alright said the LABS rewards would be created from thin air

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What BTC gives value is someone asking 10.000 of them for a pizza.

[23-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If nobody is offering anything for the LABS they earn, then it doesnt matter

[23-Nov-18 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
Contract devs still needs LABS to pay notaries

[23-Nov-18 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
that's what you seem to not understand

[23-Nov-18 12:47 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, a bit quieter here.

[23-Nov-18 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Incentivized testing is only a feature of what KMDLabs offers. And the PoC for that proved it works very well.
Projects needing specific plans for incentivized tests can set them up with us. There is a risk of 'loosing' money, but testing software generally isn't free at that level anyhow.

[23-Nov-18 01:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Of course there is also the possibility of gain too.

[23-Nov-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a lot about keeping devs making stuff together as well, colabaration, as they all share the same coin, rather than having a new token for evey contract, this allows things to happen much faster than usual, as have already been proven by what we have done already.

[23-Nov-18 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Also the people using the test cluster aren't and probably won't only be devs looking to profit. Of course there is that possibility. 
Many of the people now are there to learn through there testing.

[23-Nov-18 01:28 PM] CrisF#3405
As for the testers, not all and probably not most are there for a salary or even a big score.  I was there to learn, help and maybe as a very long shot get some valuable coins back.
Many people have projects, ideas, or in some cases just dreams, that they need a place to work on. KMDLabs gives them that place. The ease of use and network of support makes that very much easier than doing by themselves.

[23-Nov-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
LABS represents testing time. time is money, therefore LABS has value

[23-Nov-18 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810

Yeah LABS has saves time.  Everything you do saves the newbie blockchain  üêí  operator from starting from zero.  Just like Ubuntu took Debian‚Äôs testing repo and accelerated the Debian release process.  Check history from Debian Sid to the following releases.

When a dApp team knows front end coding and some of the crypto conditions logic but not vin/vout details, they‚Äôre not going to know blockchain ops, mining pools, coin migrations etc.

Getting a product to market or productization of an idea needs agility and flexibility.  LABS gives this to the ecosystem.

Hello guys...
I'm trying to compare a PoS-based crypto currency with Pirate.

PoS is protected against 51 % attacks.  In addition, PoS could become more interesting in the future for environmentally friendly reasons.  Even Ethereum is working on a hybrid version.  I am asking myself how Komodo wants to solve this problem?  Hybrid with the help of Veruscoin?  Or is it something you don't even think about?

[01-Jan-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
PoS has some other issues than 51% attack, though dPoW likely solves most of them

[01-Jan-19 06:14 PM] Seko#7408
Where are the advantages of dPoW in compare to PoS? And what about the environmental idea?

[01-Jan-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant compare dPoW to PoS

[01-Jan-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW works with whatever existing consensus mechanism

[01-Jan-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
weakness of PoS is not external reference

[01-Jan-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is all about external reference

[01-Jan-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to at least understand a bit about PoS weakness to understand

[01-Jan-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
well, i guess it ignores the 51% attack for PoW, i guess it goes without saying

[02-Jan-19 02:41 AM] Mylo#8306
If consensus is a layer of concrete on the sidewalk/pavement, and your layer of concrete is as thick as your community invollved (PoW or PoS), there is still one layer of concrete.

One layer of concrete is pretty easy to drill into and make a hole for a person to squeeze into.

dPoW adds 2 more concrete layers (KMD & BTC), and an important timing layer.

Try drilling into 3 layers of concrete, of different grades.  You need different drill bits to go through different harder concrete.

The KMD & BTC layers also have steel mesh to re-inforce and strengthen it.
Your drill needs to be good enough to drill through 3 layers of concrete, be wide enough for the  person to climb into.

The drill holes are filled by very quickly drying cement, almost as soon as someone tries drilling into it - because the cement auto-repairs as time moves forwards (blocks are made).

But this seems business related, FDA is testing a permissioned blockchain for healthcare providers to share access to sensitive information. It started with 4 hospitals (not sure where it's at now) but they are using the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton to develop a solution. Seems they are using Ethereum but adding privacy features (I believe off-chain)
<https://gcn.com/articles/2018/06/22/fda-blockchain-ehr-sharing.aspx>

Here's Booz Allen Hamilton's white paper in regards to the chain.
<https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/13/17>

TLDR: Building permissioned blockchain that provides 3 tiers of information access, a descriptor(public), summary (permissioned), and full access (permissioned). They said "special purpose software designed to work along side the blockchain must be implemented to facilitate additional layers of encryption that enforce the privacy of content embedded within transaction data"
Also that "the data owner may revoke access to a piece of shared data with a guarantee that even a receiver‚Äôs private key together with the raw blockchain transaction data would not be sufficient to obtain data access"

@Steve Lee and @Bitcoin Benny, thoughts on this for a business opportunity/use case for Komodo? Seems the privacy aspect could be something Komodo could do well.

[07-Jan-19 02:01 AM] Regnar#6164
Marek Cyran - Chief Scientist - Booz Allen Hamilton (Author of that white paper)
LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/marek-cyran-82018011/> 
email : Cyran_Marek2@bah.com

Lauren Neal - Principal Strategy Innovations Group - Booz Allen Hamilton (On that project)
LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenberrymanneal/>

We should reach out to these people just to make a connection, talk with them about the types of things they see their clients needing from blockchain and what is missing from projects like Ethereum. What they have to do to get around the limitations they are seeing on chain, and we can attempt to develop solutions, or might even already have the solutions (zk-snarks for privacy, language agnostic for contracts, etc) in order to make Komodo a more attractive platform. And then we can be on their minds when they look to implement another Blockchain for their clients.

Only single user (BarterDEX reporting this issue. Suspect previous blockchain data present). Bounty removed.
Closing. BarterDEX have confirmed it as a non-issue. They were using a replacement library for malloc (faster, more efficient) and that seemed to cause the problem

I understand sapling addresses are pretty efficient and removing z-addressing might be the proper way to move forward swiftly. However, in my mind being backward compatible and knowing that my funds are safe in the ecosystem  for the years ahead are quite more important. There seems to be a tradeoff here. Isnt this a big decision to remove these addresses? Some people will lose their funds for sure. Or some people might think twice to leave their funds in KMD if they wont be able to check KMD news for a while. Was there any alternative solutions? What was their pro cons?
