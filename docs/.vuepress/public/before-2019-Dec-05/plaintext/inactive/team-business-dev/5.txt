ok I seem to not know some vital info. Thank you

> Some people will lose their funds for sure.
Completely inaccurate. No one will be losing KMD over this as long as they have their privkey safe. And, there are only about 80K funds left in sprout address. Users still have 3 weeks time to move them to transparent address.

[23-Jan-19 12:43 PM] idrtis#7552
Thanks for the info

[23-Jan-19 12:43 PM] idrtis#7552
I ll read in more detail

[23-Jan-19 12:50 PM] idrtis#7552
I might misremember but I believe I have read some talks here about burning those coins

[23-Jan-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
afaik, there's been no discussion of ever burning KMD (maybe you're thinking of PIRATE?)

any locked KMD will always be recoverable. PIRATE is a different coin and its community will decide

Hello!

[30-Jan-19 10:21 AM] Nikolay Sadonin#5680
am from Ternion Exchange (crypto/crypto crypto/fiat).
Do you have interest in listing?

[30-Jan-19 10:27 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I dont speak for the team here but at $35,000 to list seems really expensive for an exchange that is not currently live. Did the 5 coins you have listed already pay 35k?

[30-Jan-19 10:29 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Imo listing Komodo as starting pair for free would benefit you as komodo has a very large community.

I think @FishyGuts knows who

[01-Feb-19 01:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Fab√ò Do you want the existing KMD / ARRR bots or do you want your own?  
If it is your own, contact @sclear and let him know Pirate sent ya!

[01-Feb-19 02:06 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Thanks @FishyGuts terrific we could put both ARRR for pirates and privacy guys and KSB for fiat guys

[11-Feb-19 09:21 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Hiya! @polycryptoblog  everyone! üòÉ Introduced myself before in #talk-general  I am involved with https://resistance(dot)io (  exchange, ResDEX and contacting you on their behalf. I have reached out to individual projects within KMD ecosystem before but thought it best to interact with you guys directly.

We wish to position ourselves as 'One Stop exchange' for all privacy coins. For liquidity provision we have partnered with HUOBI & XRP market-makers. As a DEX we do not plan to charge listing fee for KMD or its asset chains. 

Happy to give contact information so we can discuss about this more with a developer from team, perhaps jl777?  Looking forward to cooperating! 

------
Short tldr;  ResDEX uses instant atomic swaps (within 30 sec trades at the moment) for decentralized trading (using RES as collateral) and zk-Snarks for Privacy.
TOR routing is supported natively as well on ResDEX.  RES coin itself is CPU mineable through yespower algo (rewards split between 30% Proof of Research, 30% Proof of Work, 30% Masternodes & 10% for development)  and anyone can check out working prototype for POR through https://respool.io/

P.S Would partners@komodoplatform. com be the best way to reach out to you guys? : )

Send the information to partners@komodoplatform.com I will go through all the information and get back to you to discuss further

[11-Feb-19 09:31 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Awesome! Thanks for quick response Poly! Will contact you through there. Looking forward to discussing!

[11-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
As an added question @polycryptoblog  we are also interested in listing multiple sub-chains (that obviously support atomic swap (probably rules out ARRR  :/ ) ). If possible; can you send me leads for them or suggest best possible way to reach out? 

I would assume that every project within KMD ecosystem would have its own requirements for listing and point of contact?

[11-Feb-19 09:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The ecosystem section of this discord has all the projects associated .  I do not think anyone will object to a listing on an exchange  if it‚Äôs free.

[11-Feb-19 11:18 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Yea I thought so as well! Thank you for all assistance @polycryptoblog  , will be keeping you updated! 
P.S You can also tune in to our exchange demo scheduled today to get idea about interface etc. Here's the tweet for it !  (hope I am not being too intrusive by sharing link)

@Wolf of RES I notice your DEX, which is built on MM1, offers Instant Swaps. Is the collateral address independent or still under third party control (Komodo used wallets which they had control over for this mode)?

[12-Feb-19 10:26 PM] crypto999#4866
And if independent can you expand on how that was achieved, as there are a host of variables that make it problematic...

[13-Feb-19 10:58 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
@crypto999  Masternodes will be used to secure the collateral. Will outline roles for masternodes more in our governance document which we are drafting at the moment. 

To ask your opinion what problems do you foresee ?

[13-Feb-19 06:14 PM] crypto999#4866
A secure decentralized custody solution with autonomous refund and penalization is pretty impressive. Look forward to reading more!

@Malti
Kasper from Guts was in a Dutch broadcast yesterday. He said that they had choosen for Ethereum because that was the only one with a smart contract at that time. Whether they experienced limits on Ethereum, the answer was yes and no.

He told that there are indeed better blockchains at the moment, but that they do not want to choose a blockchain too early. They do not want to focus on Komodo or another one yet. Komodo, because of the high transactions would possible be a good reason he said, but they first want to look at how they can use the blockchain. Which applications are needed and only then see which chain fits the best for them.

He said: Why choose Komodo, consider because of the high transaction could be a reason but do we need it or can we do it smarter.

He really needs to do some homework I think! üòÄ

If the multiple-signature wallet provider restricts its role to creating un-hosted
wallets that require adding a second authorization key to the wallet owner‚Äôs private
key in order to validate and complete transactions, the provider is not a money
transmitter because it does not accept and transmit value.56
56. 31 CFR ¬ß 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(A).
 On the other hand, if the
person combines the services of a multiple-signature wallet provider and a hosted
wallet provider, that person will then qualify as a money transmitter. Likewise,
if the value is represented as an entry in the accounts of the provider, the owner
does not interact with the payment system directly, or the provider maintains
total independent control of the value, the provider will also qualify as a money
transmitter, regardless of the label the person applies to itself or its activities.
