yes, I am talking with EMC2 and a few other coins about dpow and working on this document to give some public docs: https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md

@sœÜldat where does "800 of the coin" come from? I am trying to be specific when coins ask me the real costs of dpow

[13-Sep-18 03:56 PM] sœÜldat#8733
@dukeleto from here: https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

[13-Sep-18 04:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@sœÜldat so my next question is, how is that 800 COIN used? Is it purely for txfees, does it get paid to James like the 300KMD, etc...

[13-Sep-18 04:06 PM] sœÜldat#8733
@PTYX maybe ?

[13-Sep-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
these questions are coming up as more coins approach us about double spend attack prevention via dpow

[13-Sep-18 04:08 PM] sœÜldat#8733
yes it is important to be precise with regard to new coins that want this protection

[13-Sep-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be 300KMD + 300COIN, the costs would be the same for both coins

[13-Sep-18 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
the 800 didn't quite make sense to me, that makes more sense for txfees in KMD + COIN

[13-Sep-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
probably a typo that got a life of its own

[13-Sep-18 04:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
notary nodes will be running full nodes of COIN and need to make transactions

[13-Sep-18 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
many projects are asking if they need to run their own notary nodes, they don't quite understand what KMD provides, so I am trying to explain it all in the "master kmd dpow" document

[13-Sep-18 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
this will hopefully prevent them wanting to implement dpow in ways that James already realized wouldn't work, and avoiding wasted time

[13-Sep-18 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
We are sticking with 300 so it's not from us.

[13-Sep-18 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
we still need one more piece to really deliver "double spend attack prevention", and that is an API to query to answer the question "has this txid of COIN been notarized to KMD/BTC?"

[13-Sep-18 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's being worked on, James set a bounty. Without that, exchanges can't use and won't see the benefit of notarization data. And they are the ones forcing coins to implement this stuff, and making coins pay them back for double spends that happen on their exchanges(!)

[13-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Good stuff @dukeleto & all people working on it. Only reassures me in my view that kmd really is one of the, if not the best project out there.

@Cryptosi   Basically you can use BarterDEX to facilitate the offering if you are using an assetchain as the coin

GUTS on ETH is experienceing heavy issues with scalability and are looking for a new chain to move to

[13-Nov-18 04:04 PM] Malti#3948
might be a good lead?

[13-Nov-18 04:05 PM] Malti#3948
GUTS is a blockchain that is focusing on issueing tickets for concrets etc

[13-Nov-18 08:19 PM] Regnar#6164
@Malti what's the website for them?

[13-Nov-18 08:21 PM] Malti#3948
https://guts.tickets

[13-Nov-18 08:22 PM] Malti#3948
We‚Äôve investigated them and some colleagues had a call with the team where they said they were looking for Ethereum alternatives as they need to issue 100k tickets in 2019 (at least). With ETH this is waaay to expensive

[13-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Regnar#6164
ohh okay the token is GET but the project is GUTS got it

[13-Nov-18 08:25 PM] Malti#3948
They are looking into hyperledger buuut this would cause a whole new set of troubles as it is permissioned

[13-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Regnar#6164
yea makes sense.

[18-Nov-18 12:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@Malti I think it's possible to issue tickets as form of assetsCC tokens and even maybe create custom cryptoconditions smart contract contract for ticketing. Almost zero fees + dPOW protection - Komodo should be a good option for them

[18-Nov-18 03:43 PM] PTYX#6840
@Cryptoon i have to be honest with the client

[18-Nov-18 03:44 PM] PTYX#6840

Is the notarized hash to bitcoin or dPoW ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù for new Komodo platform coins?

[21-Nov-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[21-Nov-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really

[22-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Malti#3948
330 kmd per year no?

[22-Nov-18 04:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
365 and 365 of the coin being notarized .  Also there is costs for integration,  but komodo assetchains have a severely reduced cost opposed to non kmd chains

[23-Nov-18 02:16 AM] PTYX#6840
No it's actually ~$2500  a year plus 365 KMD/365 Of the coin being notarized as per the new pricing plans. Is that correct @Audo ?

[23-Nov-18 02:20 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm not sure if the information has been released in a marketing fashion but I was given confirmation that the pricing was changed. That's what we have been communicating to our clients. Also, the price will slowly increase as more projects are added until a maximum cost is reached. The plan is to increase each time a new chain is added until we reach 100 chains. This will encourage projects to get added to dpow  asap.

[23-Nov-18 02:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
"Also the costs for integration" = fiatamount

[23-Nov-18 02:23 AM] PTYX#6840
There are already 2 projects in the pipeline that should be added in the next weeks. It's first come first serve. So if a project is added today, their price will stay the same for their anual renewal. It's in their best interest to be an early adopter of dpow. And Chainzilla is planning on strongly promoting dpow once the ico campaign is finished.

[23-Nov-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need to stop adding coins to KMD notaries ... I have almost finished a second layer system, hopefully we get to test it well enough for KMDLABS so we cna use it ... this will drive down costs for dPoW a fair bit, and stop sacrificing KMD's security. We should not have hundreds of coins, ont he main KMD notaries... its just a bad idea.

[23-Nov-18 08:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
elevator pitch on what KMDLABS is?

[23-Nov-18 11:10 AM] Audo#5667
It's STAKED rebranded. @Alright knows more üòÉ

[23-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
@Cryptoon it's a coin to incentivize testing smart contracts. Plan to be a resource that the whole ecosystem can use to iron out bugs in smart contracts before deploying them on production chains

[23-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And who incentivizes? What gives LABS a value? It will be kind of pegged back to kmd then?

[23-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
You can earn LABS by finding bugs in smart contracts, staking, mining or running a notary. We set up a system to where we can add contracts on the fly without the need for a hard fork. A contract dev can spin up a chain(only cost is notarization cost), people can test this chain, if a bug is found they will make a bounty claim. If enough notaries sign off on this bounty claim, they get the coins

[23-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
So contract dev can start a chain and have people test it for basically no cost the them

[23-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
here's a elevator pitch I typed up previously

[23-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
we'll have a website up with more info next week

[23-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
```
Purpose of STAKED is to give crypto condition contract devs a place to have their contracts tested. There is a problem in that a coin dev cannot just implement the first iteration of a new contract on a production coin as each bug could mean a hard fork.(think KMDICE the last couple weeks) What STAKED allows a dev to do is spin up a STAKED chain that is fungible with all other STAKED chains. They can have custom consensus rules or contracts. Testers can then be rewarded by finding bugs in these contracts. If there is a bug in the contract, they simply kill the chain, update the contract and start another chain.

STAKED will be the only asset chain with "opt-in contracts", meaning contracts are not compulsory consensus rules. In order to implement a contract on a typical assetchain, all nodes must update. On STAKED however, you simply add the contract to a new chain. If a user wants to use the contract, they sync the chain and transfer coins to it. If user isn't interested in the contract, they can simply ignore it. 
```

[23-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
replace STAKED with KMDLabs üòõ

[23-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, the reason/need for a kmdlabs chain is clear, but what will give it value, as devs/testers will need to be incentivized to do testing?

[23-Nov-18 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
Couple interesting projects have cropped up on it already. @blackjok3r created something called a "streamer" chain, which can be used to stream arbitrary files to a pemissioned chain that is then dpow'd to KMD. This allows for uncensorable streaming and if one copy of the chain exists, it can be proved that it is authentic. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is working on "DragonHound" which is a way for him to track his dog via GPS and post coordinates via oracles.

[23-Nov-18 12:07 PM] Alright#0419
I made the trollbox proof of concept as well, but that's not LABS specific. It's on chain real time chat. Think immutable decentralized discord.

[23-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm or people will need to buy kmdlabs to offer the reward to testers

[23-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure I have a clear cut answer for that @Cryptoon. If you just look at how much progress we've made in the past couple months, I think you would agree that it will have value

[23-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so buy/sell is in equilibrium

[23-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
They need to fund notaries with LABS

[23-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Alright#0419
That's it. Notaries can choose how much LABS they want before they begin to notarize someone's chain

[23-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It will have value...  as its PoS (people love getting more coins) and it also directs heaps of contracts (that would likely all have their own coin like KMDICE) to ahve a single curency

[23-Nov-18 12:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Devil's advocate will ask if this does not give notaries too much power to decide whether or not something is tested enough or whatever

[23-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the BR is only 9 with 1 going to notary nodes.

[23-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is nothing stopping someon (devs or anyone else) just starting another set of notary nodes to compete with is id we fo a bad job, por try and charge to much

[23-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
can there be more sets of NN? As I thought NN pubkeys were hardcoded

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Alright#0419
LABS is likely to have bleeding edge contracts before any other chain

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Alright#0419
as we can add them on a whim unlike all other chains

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They are but I made it so you can have as many set of them as you like and stilll keep compatibility with KMD

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, maybe as a last remark, is it a good idea to have inflation on the chain with staking, as this will diminish the value somewhat depending on the reward plan.

[23-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could ahve 1000 sets of notary nodes ewach notarising a single chain, if you wanted to

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the idea is that, we have the knowhow and the community to provide the best/cheapest service over someone forking our code.

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say you offer 1M LABS to test whatever, and it takes 6 months for the contract to complete, but meanwhile the 1M labs has diminished in value because of staking rewards

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
devs will be incentivized less

[23-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because of this

[23-Nov-18 12:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sorry for the questions, just the first things that pop up in my head, and I'm sure others will probably have similar questions, best to think about it ahead of launching everyhting

[23-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
Again, only cost to contract dev is paying notaries

[23-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Alright#0419
the bug bounties come from thin air and are part of the emissions themselves

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
nothing to stop them from adding additional bounties to attract more testers, but it's not necessary

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, but again, that was my main question, what gives it value?

[23-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why would someone pay kmd/btc/xxx for LABS?

[23-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok you can stake it for more LABS, but what does it matter if LABS itself doesnt really have value as it's created from thin air

[23-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless the notaries buy the LABS back to pay out later again etc

[23-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm probably missing something, but for now it doesnt really make sense to me, I'll think about it some more and come back if I have more questions

[23-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Alright#0419
You have a valid point. We're just having a hard time articulating our vision here

[23-Nov-18 12:20 PM] Alright#0419
Most of the mechanisms for it is not set in stone. Feel free to make suggestions
