channels access is role based, if you are testing mm2 ask @Audo to assign the role

[31-Aug-19 07:24 AM] Audo#5667
we enabled a spam prevention mechanism which required us to tweak channel permissions.

AtomicDEX beta channel and all other channels should be now visible to everyone. If not let me know!

@jorian what is your price?

[02-Sep-19 03:43 PM] jorian#4555
on atomicdex you can buy 10 DEX for 400 KMD, maybe that suits your needs?

[02-Sep-19 03:43 PM] Acura#2748
I can sell Dex Asset also. 
Good Amounts available

[02-Sep-19 03:44 PM] jorian#4555
@Acura what is your price then?

[02-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Acura#2748
Not cheap - 50 kmd can offer up to 1-2k Dex

[02-Sep-19 03:52 PM] phm87#7395
@Acura at 50 kmd for 1000 DEX, I am interested. Do you mean 1dex per 50 kmd ?

I‚Äôd say get crypto coin traders/synq to look into atomicdex. Was watching a Livestream and they said they had interest in komodo and our tech

[07-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be good to get a lot of exposure

[07-Sep-19 10:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
