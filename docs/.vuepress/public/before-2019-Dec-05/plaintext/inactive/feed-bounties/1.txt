@PhilConee hi, the bounty is still open. The main stumbling block is  how home users can setup a full relay node. Also I should ask the admin to correct the title, it's not for a graphical user interface. It was after I created it that I was told that it's not trivial. So the bounty is more for solving this backend issue and then have a working solution at cli/uglygui level.  If one can also do a pretty gui it's welcome but not the first thing

Hi everyone I"m putting up a personal bounty of 100 KMD for a graphic that reveals the inner dragon of my ever escaping hound
I'm working on a GPS tracking solution with pi/arduino which incorporates oracles cryptoconditions to alert when he escapes, and broadcast location intel to find him.
He's had a few 24hr+ walkabouts over the last fortnight, most recently last night during harsh thunderstorms. 
The comercial GPS "Biotraka" was not up to the task, failing to transmit and no longer on his collar when he returned.

[14-Oct-18 05:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be housing the GPS unit in a K9 tactical vest once ready. It's likely there will be another graphics comp like the above once it's ready to go.

[14-Oct-18 11:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I"m not totally sure yet, but the concept is based on the dog having an inner dragon, stubborrn, intelligent but a lust (or dreaming of) the freedom of the skies. My first image thought was a sketch with his shadow risng, like batman, but forming a dragon.
It's to promo a gps/cryptoconditions tracking project for a dog who is impossible to contain in my backyard, and has escaped 4 times in the last 2 weeks, twice for over 24hrs.

oh i see. and u want to include live picture of your dog in this artwork.. okay cool.

[14-Oct-18 10:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont want to constraint the art, a caricature of the hound etc is ok too. Over the next few days I'll try and get some better photos and write up the full background to this and specifics on the comp like timeline etc. @NutellaLicka  your pic isn't what I was thinkning to begin with, but I'd never have thought of it until you didi it! Sytle and interpretation is open to individual artistic freedom, though I'll elaborate more about the background of the concept etc in the next few days so it's a bit less of a vague brief. The "hidden dragon" can be anything across the broad range of lore to the reptiles we all know and love.  Can be a shadow rising, or a trickster spirit on the shoulder whispering escape.
He's a river dog, when he escapes he heads into the bush along it and is a master at evading capture. Had 3 ranger units trying to corner him a couple weeks ago but he gave them the run around for a couple of hours unitl I showed up.  So could be him evading capture attempts.
 He might have a den on the foreshore, guarding a hoard of kmd?  Or maybe his dragon familiar flys up to scout his next destination as he breaks through all baricades to reach it. He's a good geocaching partner, and that kind of ties in with the tracker gps side of things, so it could be a cache he's searching for or protecting.

[14-Oct-18 10:48 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Distilled to it's most basic, the concept is dog/dragon/freedom. I"ll add some context for personality and activity based on experience soon

[14-Oct-18 10:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
He stalks my chickens, not to eat but he seems to get a huge kick out of winding them up. If one is sitting on eggs, he'll stand nearby and bark to move it along so he can grab an egg, go drop it on the concrete an have a feed.

payouts are also working, and pool fee is wokring as normal. Only required setting is `"disablecb":true` in coins.json for all coins sapling is activated on, and this will also work on coins saplin is not activated on. Not 100% sure if pirate payouts work with it, but as webworkeers pool already has sapling in it, I assume pirate pools will use his.

[04-Dec-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This pool can be changed to work with pirate if someone wants this just ask.
