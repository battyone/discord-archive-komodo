It's currently the best example of a chain using clusters, the 'merkle of merkle of merkle' tech, activating the maximum AC parameters that are possible (a few exceptions). If you want to see the cutting-edge use of MoMoM chains then don't miss this. https://t.co/Kmo8NFIVMy

Think of Komodo as the crypto multiverse. Within Komodo, there can be an infinite number of ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù, each with their own laws and conventions -- interdependent, yet very much independent at the same time.

Tech Tuesday #2  - if you don't follow the tech, i found the payment channels (a lightning network alternative) as the most interesting.
Also:
 - #pirate updates and the zCash update strategy were a good discussion in discord last week. 
 - #private-staked providing ecosystem services is coming to light as well. 
 - A hint of an alternative wallet being possible

Basically stuff that doesn't hit the front page until it's already built, you have the opportunity to read about developments as they happen!

https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-2/  

Any questions, ask in reddit or somewhere here in discord
