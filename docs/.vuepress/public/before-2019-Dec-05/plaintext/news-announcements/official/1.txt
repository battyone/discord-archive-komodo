[slack] <Ben from Komodo> here CoinDesk wrote an article about 51% attacks becoming more regular: https://www.coindesk.com/blockchains-feared-51-attack-now-becoming-regular. 

However, the article doesn't talk about the counter to them which is our 'delayed proof fo work'. dPOW gives an independent chain the security of Bitcoin's hashrate by on its chain.

1. You ought to look at how big Bitcoin's hashrate is compared to everything else (which is why it makes an independent chain secure) https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-eth-bch-ltc.html 

2. You could read The Merkle's article "Can Delayed Proof-of-Work Effectively Counter 51% Attacks?" - https://nulltx.com/can-delayed-proof-of-work-effectively-counter-51-attacks/.

3. You could share the news about projects like GameCredits adopting #dPOW in response to attacks https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=eae7d500e24dcdb21b359fccf&id=22eccdf457.

Help us reach out to CoinDesk and ask them to include 'delayed proof of work' in an update or response to this article. Or help us boost these posts on social media..

We have new Agama build v41 https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
This new version release changelog:

* Fixed settings save bug that got socket timeout param broken
* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io
* ZILLA coin added.
* Fixes the recent SPV connectivity issues

Direct Links:
Linux: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-installer.zip
macOS: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-osx-installer.zip
Windows: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-windows-installer.zip
Linux Portable: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-portable.zip

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

This can be done by reset settings from settings. If resetting does not work, please remove the `config.json` file manually.

Data to be deleted: 
Please don't delete the whole `Agama` data directory as the dir contains your encrypted seeds
* Ubuntu: Delete `~/.agama/config.json 
* MacOS: Delete `config.json` file from ~/Library/Application\ Support/Agama dir
* Windows: Delete `config.json` file from C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Agama\ dir

When you change an entry in the `Settings` and save it, for it to take effect: 

* Click `Complete Logout` from the Top Menu
* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.

BarterDEX GUI's withdraw funtion for ETH/ERC20 is currently not working. There is no risk of losing funds even if you would try to do that. Our Dev team is working on fixing it.

Hi everyone I have an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not offical KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

DEV UPDATE: fix for ETH/ERC20 withdraw just pushed to git source code few min ago. Those who uses BarterDEX directly from github repo, use lates `dev` branch update and it should be working. Others just wait for next build release. Thanks.

**Public Marketing Board:** https://trello.com/b/xCc8hngf/public-komodo-marketing-board

We have some time wanted to bring more transparency on our marketing efforts, and as a result of that we have created a public marketing Trello board.

We will keep it up to date and share everything we can. It is a new thing, so there are probably some things missing that I didn't think of. I would us also to document our marketing strategy there later on.

**How it works**

- Post your marketing ideas to our forum or share them on Discord (https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/marketing)
- Ask questions here on this channel
- Provide us feedback on things that are not yet published, so we can do even better marketing!

It's a win-win for our team and for our active community. You will get an insight into what will be happening and we will get valuable feedback and more ideas.

**Reminder:** in 2.5 months (block 1M) the Komodo user reward rules change from 12 month cap to 1 month cap. All this means is that you will have to begin claiming them monthly instead of annually. Also, the "mining free for all" feature will be removed, which affects miners.
