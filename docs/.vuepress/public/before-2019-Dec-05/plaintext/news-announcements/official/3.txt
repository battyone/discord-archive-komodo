I cant overstate the magnitude of the achievement by miketout! In about a month using CC, he solved a problem that is still unsolved by ETH after years of casper research and it is in a much simpler method, which makes it much more likely to be robust. Congratulations Verus!!

everyone We have identified a SPV reward claim bug in Agama which doesn't allow claiming reward if the transaction was made after block 1 million and about 30 days old. We are working on a fix and will update you as soon as possible. Until then, please use native mode to claim Komodo Active User Reward. Also, please use native mode if you can't claim Komodo reward or wait for the next version to be released. Thank you for your understanding.
Your funds are safe in your address as they were as long as you are in control of your privatekey and haven't shared with anyone. Please reach to us in #support #deleted-channel if you have any queries.
Other Agama wallet features are functioning as normal.

Explanation of the new Crypto Conditions to help you articulate what it actually is - basically a consensus extending framework based on open standards which includes the ability to do smart contracts.   Extending consensus by a new opcode (like a command to pay to an address in bitcoin) and then having a library of functions to choose from with that transaction (not limited to just payments) - good luck!!  Any questions ask in #dev-general or #dev-interoperability for further discussion!

Want to be part of a small group of beta testers for the Agama Wallet refresh? Click this link to apply - https://ideasbynature.typeform.com/to/BNkvvQ

1. We'll ask you a few questions about wallets in general, the formats you prefer and problems/issues they currently have. It's not intended to be a survey about Agama directly but rather an opportunity for us to better understand your needs as a crypto wallet user.

2. At the end of the survey, we'll ask you if you'd like to be involved in live user tests, which can be done remotely, and, if so, ask you to leave us an email address.

3. The Komodo team will select a small group of people from among those who indicated a desire to participate. We will choose participants based on the effort put into the comments in Step 1. This is a great chance to have your feedback and opinions heard in the live user tests.

Take part here: https://ideasbynature.typeform.com/to/BNkvvQ. everyone

If you’re in our Discord much you may know we’re currently working on a Discord reorg to make it easy for people to find information they’re looking for and where they might want to get involved. It’s about creating better paths for people.

I am looking for people to volunteer as moderators to take ownership of some specific spaces within our Discord. As a Moderator, you will already be active on our Discord and you will want to help us to organise and improve our community. This won’t be paid, however, you will get a sparkly mod rank.

What this will mean in practice is that you’ll be responsible for a small number of channels and you will pin important news and clean up any spam. A good example will be the ‘community lounge’ and that may have two or three people who are willing to volunteer to help.

If you’re interested in being a part of the new Discord reorg and want to be included, then DM me and tell me which channels you’re active in the most and what changes you think we ought to make. everyone.

You can check out the test server here which will give you an idea of some of the changes we're considering (and you can leave feedback there too) - https://discord.gg/XcQfbGa.

I'm pleased to report a massive upgrade in technology for the entire Komodo ecosystem. Please note that this update is a hard fork. It is, therefore, a mandatory update.

- Sapling Upgrade
- VerusHash algorithm, bringing near-equality between CPUs and GPUs with the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world
- VerusPoS algorithm, allowing for a 50/50 hybrid blockchain, which can be combined with either 50% VerusHash or 50% Equihash for the proof of work component.
- Time Locking, which allows mined rewards to be time-locked for random release, within a set of parameters.
- The “Eras” parameter (ac_eras), allowing 3 eras of different coin emission schedules to be defined which alter emission, including slow start options, and linear exponential decay at specific, predetermined block height schedules.

Our Discord has been long over-due a tidy and after much thought, we have a format and structure to implement which will make it easier to navigate (esp if you're new). Over the next few hours, I'll be reorganising the channels and categories. As a rule, we'll use search operators as the first word in a channel to make it easy to search and so that the nav makes sense as at a glance. If you have any questions or want to leave feedback please do so in #deleted-channel which is a temporary channel that will help us spot any errors or concerns while this process takes place.

Warning! Only keep your Komodo in your Ledger if you don't want/need to use them for next 1-2 months, until Ledger adds support for Sapling. We hope that Ledger Sapling support will be ready before X-mas or January 2019. However we can't guarantee what they will or won't do.

Please update your Agama to latest version 0.3.1d from our website. If you have been using version 0.3.0, it is recommended to update to this version which comes with some bug fixes and latest Komodo binary. Download Agama version 0.3.1d from here - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
There are Installer version as default now and portable versions at alternative download page.
Keep using this version as this is sapling ready. Please don't use any version older than 0.3.0 as those are not sapling ready and send any tx using those version will not confirm on mainnet from 15th December.
If you have funds on any z address, please wait for further announement after 20th December. You need to migrate your private funds to a sapling address. We will announce guides to do so and the required `zmigrate` dAPP.
Please keep your wallet.dat and private keys safely backed up to ensure your funds are safe. With the hardfork there is not going to be any chainsplit, only one mainchain. If you keep using this version you will be on the main chain and your funds are safe as long as you are in control of your private key or wallet.dat file.
If you are a Ledger user please checkout Ledger's announement regarding our Sapling upgrade https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013635173
If you can't send your funds or don't want to send your funds to Agama, don't worry, your funds are safe. Anytime you can use those funds to send or claim reward securely using an offline computer. Read our guide here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026860-komodo-sapling-upgrade-important-info-for-ledger-users
Please report any critical bugs if you find and any suggestions to make things better. Thanks for using Agama.

It’s almost the end of 2018, and this year we have witnessed a number of 51% attacks (double spending) on Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains. In response to Justin Ehrenhofer's dPoW article, we explain Komodo’s delayed Proof of Work (dPoW). This is probably the best explanation of dPoW written so far! Great work @grewalsatinder <https://blog.komodoplatform.com/delayed-proof-of-work-explained-9a74250dbb86> everyone.

everyone Dear members, we recently implemented dPoW (delayed Proof of Work) Confirmation field into Komodo and assetchains, thanks to @dukeleto.  It basically means any confirmation number it shows for KMD deposit which is more than 1 is secured by dPoW and can't be double spent. With this exchanges are safe to reduce required confirmations to credit any deposits. Works for KMD and AC which has dPoW. Currently, Bittrex and Digital Price exchanges are using this feature. Digital Price already using 20 confs which is pretty fast. We have reached out to Bittrex if they wish to reduce required confs. We well announce we have more info. Thanks for being here. I wish you all a very Happy New Year.
P.S.: Agama users can test this feature using Komodo or any assetchain in native mode and sending out a tx. 
More details on dPoWConf - https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html
