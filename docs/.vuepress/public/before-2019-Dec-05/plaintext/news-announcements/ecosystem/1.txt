I have created a new role 'Ecosystem Developer' for people who are building something on top of Komodo. I enabled few extra abilities such as 'change nickname' and 'manage emojis'. Hopefully you are able to change your name to include your project name now, and you can upload special emojis related to your project.

All ecosystem project owners can get this role.

If you have open positions or bounties available you can post them to our forum's Job section: https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/jobs-bounties

We are trying to start utilizing our new Komodo forum more. We try to limit the number of channels we have here on discord and for the time being we won't make a separate 'job-offers' channel. Forum format should work a lot better in this case.

[09-Jul-18 04:07 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
Good afternoon, I have received several questions regarding the possibility of adding AC to the services we are developing. Let me share some thoughts on it:

1 - Any AC needs to have people willing to buy or sell (orderbooks), which probably means there is people that beliefs in the product and has real market expectations, thus a buy-sell market comes to exist

2-  A market can be a centralized exchange (which involves listing efforts and trusting a 3rd party) or a DEX like Barterdex. Unfortunately BarterDex seems to be not yet ready to give a "granma friendly" experience. Thus creating enough "market liquidity" through BarterDex seems yet not a possibility. Other DEX's like the ones that trade tokens based in ETH already have acceptable liquidity pools, which means you can find acceptable orderbooks and volumes (kyber.network, oasis.dex etc)

3- For now, getting some liquidity on a KMD based Asset Chain means getting listed into a centralized Exchange, like Utruum has recently done.

That said , feel free to contact us regarding integrating AC onto our growing product portfolio
Back to work üòÉ

[09-Jul-18 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm confused

[09-Jul-18 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
How will the AC be added to the service

[09-Jul-18 04:38 PM] PTYX#6840
Is it in an exchange capacity?

[09-Jul-18 04:51 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
How AC could be added to the service?

By supporting debit cards loaded by AC or  fiat gateway between AC - EUR/USD etc
