dPoW is a security service for blockchains.  You either use the service or you don't.   You don't have to be involved in it.  If you want to be involved, you run for notary election and become an integral part of the KMD ecosystem.

probably need to be on a 'friends' list or something.   no biggie - either way, the PoP mining is interesting - similar to dPoW in that it writes to btc.

had a little scroll - you made a good point in their discord, `vbk is not a time tested project`.    here i thought you were trolling asking those questions but you were playing devils advocate :)

at the end of the day, it's their team decision.   i'm not going to lobby them to come to KMD - we have dPoW and it's approaching the third election cycle in the coming months.   They have good ideas, just a matter of securing their network.  Looks similar to settlemint on eth.

[29-Sep-18 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
Last I talked with FLO, they told me they thought KMD had the best solution and they wanted dpow, but they only had $500 to pay me to do it and I passed on that. I told them they could probably do it themselves with help of #dev-general, but now it seems they are coming up with reasons to not use DPoW. Whatever FLOats their boat

[29-Sep-18 05:29 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah it's unfortunate.  the opportunity to integrate dPoW goes much further than just your own coin... case in point 👆

Looks simple enough.

Would it be ok if I whipped up a simple JS implementation where you can input `txheight`, `nValue`, `nLockTime` and `tiptime` and it would output the interest result and you let me know if it all looks good?

[30-Sep-18 12:58 AM] lukechilds#2707

[30-Sep-18 02:52 PM] joey#9690
Hi, FLO team guy here, I can answer some of the questions posted above. The tl;dr is that apps on the FLO blockchain have features allowing users to increase the security of our chain. Removing those features is a dealbreaker. 

> why would they want to be controlling notary nodes? the idea is to not have to worry about such things
Caltech, Medici, and Alexandria projects all expressed deep concern about not having any option to allow users to participate in the security of the network. We don't want to "not worry about the security", we want to build applications in which our users can participate in the security of the network the same day that they learn about the network. In fact, in all of those projects, users are encouraged and rewarded for participating in the security of the network at the protocol level.

> they wanted duke to basically work for free
> they only had $500 
The offer was $500 in BTC upfront plus any amount of FLO you felt reasonable after the job is complete. I was asking for an hour a week in a conference call to help review our code and answer questions. I think our offer was fair, and actually better in terms of dollars per hour than a fulltime engagement where you are coding for months and responsible for delivering the entire completed software.

[30-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing about using dPoW stops people from securing the FLO blockchain. it is not needed to invade into notary space to secure things

[30-Sep-18 03:16 PM] joey#9690
I think we could unpack that statement and find points to agree and disagree on but it's moot. There is a philosophical disagreement stemming from the wishes of the applications and users in our community

[01-Oct-18 01:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@joey  traditional PoW is still required,  can you explain how they would not have a hand in the security of their own network?  And how that having FLO controlling a Notary node would be that hand in the security?

[01-Oct-18 01:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think there is a misunderstanding about the nature of the notary nodes

[01-Oct-18 01:23 AM] joey#9690
If FLO is susceptible to a 51% attack and the notary nodes help prevent a 51% attack then having control over a notary node is significant in the context of our chain's security

[01-Oct-18 01:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The mechanism by which Notary nodes help other chains  secure against 51% attacks is through group signed tx ( vast oversimplification ) onto bitcoin chain.  3rd party chains piggyback through the cascade effect.   1/64 of possible signatures is not any sort of hand of security.  Notary nodes are elected delegates,  which have a mining privilege in the Komodo chain ,simply handing over a notary node is the equivalent of paying you to secure to your chain.  If you want control of a Notary node your community can gather votes to be elected as one.   What you are paying for with DPoW integration not only making FLO compatible but the running of FLO nodes on all Notary servers, a necessary audit to confirm that running your nodes isn't going to compromise our setups.  500$ doesn't come close to the costs of integration and while yes you offered FLO which I'm sure could be taken in part,  the truth is much would have to hit the market to recover costs which would not be beneficial for FLOs price.   TLDR :  notaries secure through sending tx in Komodo chain of FLO blockhashes to prevent private mined 51% attacks and mitigate other attacks controlling one node of 64 does nothing in that process and the cost of integration is much more than offered even at modest IT rates

300kmd is cheaper than $500 anyway :trollface:

[01-Oct-18 01:47 AM] joey#9690
I don't understand, who is talking about integration costs?

[01-Oct-18 01:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's just the Komodo cost of the notarization itself not all the things that go into it

[01-Oct-18 01:47 AM] joey#9690
How is that relevant?

[01-Oct-18 01:47 AM] joey#9690
I also understand how the system works, but that was a good high level overview

[01-Oct-18 01:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You mentioned the offer being fair earlier on,  this is one of the points of contention in integration isn't it?

[01-Oct-18 01:49 AM] joey#9690
Duke asked for $1500 up front for a full integration (2 month full time engagement), and my offer was $500 up front for 1 hour a week conference call. Does that seem unreasonable?

[01-Oct-18 01:50 AM] joey#9690
In the second case, we would be doing 100% of the coding

[01-Oct-18 01:50 AM] joey#9690
I think I made that very clear in my original comment

[01-Oct-18 01:52 AM] joey#9690
Integration costs were not a point of contention by the way

[01-Oct-18 01:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Compared to what will be charged in the future 1500 is a steal.   Regardless,  FLO would still have a hand in accepting notarized blockhashes without control of a Notary node,  there is nothing about a Notarization that affects FLOs consensus mechanism ,  basically all we do is write public blockhashes.  Still up to your community to mine blocks.  Still up to the community to agree upon notarization in the event of the attack,  in fact without FLO communities accepted public blockhashes ,  done through consensus mechanism which Komodo has no hand in, what purpose does DPoW  have?   FLOs base security determines the effectiveness of DPoW

[01-Oct-18 02:00 AM] joey#9690
We agreed to his original ask

[01-Oct-18 02:00 AM] joey#9690
He suggested taking a lesser role due to his workload

[01-Oct-18 02:01 AM] joey#9690
Anyway, the point about being able to contribute to the security of the network is a philosophical disagreement that the devs building the apps running on FLO have with the notary node system

[01-Oct-18 02:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
From my point of view, it isn't much reasonable.
@dukeleto has much good understanding of Komodo/Zcash ecosystem and internal code, and he's already experienced by implementation dPoW in HUSH, and if he's one of few (I don't know any other than Duke and jl777 ) who can take this job with assurance of delivery.

[01-Oct-18 02:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from a freelancer market, if the task a project wants, and there aren't many who can do it, it raises the value of one who can offer to do it.

[01-Oct-18 02:03 AM] joey#9690
How can you possibly think that working fulltime on a project for $(3x) is better than getting $(1x) for spending 1 hour a week on it?

[01-Oct-18 02:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
dPoW is consensus level changes. It is not just a part time task. It becomes fulltime considering the urgencies it can reflect in it's implementation and testing and any urgent bug fixes.

[01-Oct-18 02:05 AM] joey#9690
Right, we would be doing that work

[01-Oct-18 02:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

agree with @Deleted User 👍

[01-Oct-18 02:07 AM] joey#9690
I think the valuable thing we can both learn here is that some projects view an elected set of nodes as less decentralized than anyone-can-contribute

[01-Oct-18 02:07 AM] joey#9690
From my perspective I was ready to hire Duke to pay him the full implementation cost to get dPoW on FLO

[01-Oct-18 02:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes I have heard this argument many times

[01-Oct-18 02:08 AM] joey#9690
The consensus among the community was that without a way to incrementally contribute to that process, we couldn't fit our apps into it

[01-Oct-18 02:08 AM] joey#9690
That's really it

[01-Oct-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but this argument lacks the understanding of the technological understanding. once it's clear, it doesn't remain the same argument.

[01-Oct-18 02:09 AM] joey#9690
I disagree, it seems more like a difference in philosophy than ignorance

[01-Oct-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this decision comes to a technical team and less to a non-technical community.

[01-Oct-18 02:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
An attacker can 51% flo with half a bitcoin.  And it seems to be 3 security profiles ( FLO, Komodo, BTC) is more decentralized than 1.

[01-Oct-18 02:24 AM] CrisF#3405
@joey  Interesting discussion!
I'm also interested in making use of dPOW security and in particiating as a NN.
As mentioned, surely there are many others out there among all of the projects that would like the same.  And yet there are only 30 (+3?) NN positions available at the next election.  
In my case, for practical reasons, I view these as 2 separate matters.
If I were to consider them as one in the same I would need to seriously consider the advice from jl777 above and create my own network notarizing to BTC. Not a realistic possibility for me at the moment.
The #notarynode channel is open to all to participate in.  Of course, that's not actually sending transactions to BTC (who does that is rightly decided by the Komodo community).  It can be a form of active participation by those who choose to use it as such though.
This discussion is useful for me to clarify the best course of action for the near future.
Hopefully further discussion generates other ideas that I can use :)
btw FLO sounds like an interesting project!

[01-Oct-18 02:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I like it to,  I hope we can work together in someway in the future even if we don't agree on some things.   Real coins with communities are special,  especially after this ICO craze.

🆒 

[01-Oct-18 02:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@CrisF  the reason for only half of the notaries being reelected is for a logistic reason,  imagine the headache if a majority of the nodes were new ,  catching everyone up to speed with what is going on especially with the rate James puts out stuff would be very stressful and would interrupt operations,  keeping a core of already trained nodes mitigates this issue greatly

[01-Oct-18 02:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also acts as incentive for good performance

[01-Oct-18 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[01-Oct-18 02:35 AM] dan.#2473
Just chiming in, the people last time around who were voted in were mostly active members of the community who contributed. The KMD whales seem to choose who should be chosen.

[01-Oct-18 02:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@joey if I get your point, the main issue raised is the decentralisation of the dPoW/Notary Nodes? Please correct me if I get it wrong. I can say next bit of my comment once you answer this 🙂

[01-Oct-18 02:37 AM] CrisF#3405
@joey Yeah, I've found the resources and forum for ideas here to be quite amazing.  And the opportunity Komodo is providing for people like me, with ideas but without deep technical knowledge or resources, is truly something that can make those ideas a reality.

[01-Oct-18 02:40 AM] joey#9690
@grewalsatinder the problem is we have 3 production apps using our blockchain and they each incentivize security of our network at the protocol level by contributing a % of sales to mining rewards. Adding another layer of security (notary nodes) without a way to contribute to the strength of that second-layer security breaks the security guarantee of the apps we've built. Technically, we don't *need* to implement anything additional, but the app developers have voiced their opinion that the guarantee of increased security based on sales % should not be altered. As someone else here said, it's an idealistic decision more than a practical one, but such is the will of the community. If it were up to me things would have been done differently, but I'm not the dictator of FLO, otherwise I would have named it joeycoin 😉

[01-Oct-18 02:41 AM] CrisF#3405
@polycryptoblog Yes, I feel that the current system of keeping on notaries is good for many reasons.

[01-Oct-18 02:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I guess where I am confused is how DPoW affects that system at all?

[01-Oct-18 02:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The second layer is directly dependent on the first.

[01-Oct-18 02:49 AM] CrisF#3405
@joey Perhaps, when you present your finding from here, the app developers will be able to come up with some solutions that suit their need?  That could then be further discussed here, to all of our benefit.

[01-Oct-18 02:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@joey okay, still unclear if it's decentralisation issue or not. Anyway, there are some options to consider.
- a 3rd party project like FLO can also setup their own independent Notary Nodes (64).
  - implement dPoW to FLO code
  - let community elect these 64 notary nodes. however the voting is managed to elect these notary nodes is up to the project and the community.
  - benefit is still getting your own set of notary nodes.
  - but at cost of btc/kmd notarisations paid by these set of notary nodes.

[01-Oct-18 02:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there's a chainmakers team too, who help such 3rd party projects.

[01-Oct-18 02:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Secondary Notary node network ,  much more intensive cost,effort and time but it would meet your requirements and be cheaper than doing direct to btc notarizations

[01-Oct-18 02:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But it may be out of the scope for what dukeleto was intending you'd be on your own a lot

Every time you add more coins to the KMD 64 notary nodes, it takes away secudity form KMD. That  is very bad.

[01-Oct-18 02:59 AM] joey#9690
@blackjok3r do you mean it takes away security because the cost of resources to audit the code and upkeep grows per project added?

[01-Oct-18 02:59 AM] joey#9690
or because it's more surface area for attack?

[01-Oct-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is one aspect... .also running millions of coins from the same set of pubkeys causes all kinds of issues. I have fixed this as best as it possibly cna be done, with a patch to iguana that uses `lockunspent` to stop utxo conflicts, but there is really no reason not to just use more sets of keys.
