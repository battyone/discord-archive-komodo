But I think AMD has pretty much the same things anyway 😦

@blackjok3r  about opensource hardware, I heard about IBM POWER and discussed it with a friend. I will ask him a link but he told me that it is not cheap (3.5k for a small dev station) and specs are limited (but it may be enough for some AC). Opensource hardware is an interesting subject. Whatever I also like AMD, their chips are not opensource

[10-Apr-19 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I have looked into that also, looks promising but cost is ridiculous at this time.

[10-Apr-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For notary node, I just went with the largest server I could get my hands on that dont have any "management engine" things ... Athlon64s dont include any hardware back door that I know of.. BUt they also lack modern instuctions so are extremly slow at some tasks... Hoever 4x12 cores, is still decent, even if power sots a bit mroe hardware cost upfront offset this for a few years at least.

[10-Apr-19 11:19 AM] phm87#7395
I heard about some ARM chips that are opensource but I don't think that a coin/AC can run on one of these. I have the same idea about AMD (no known backdoor included) but as AMD chips are closed source and as backdoors are not known before being revealed, I cannot thrust AMD at 100%

@blackjok3r so what do you suggest?

[10-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Mark81#4505
What is realistic maximum amount of blockchains that one notarynode can handle and run?

[10-Apr-19 05:52 PM] Mark81#4505
I believe that running multiple blockhains in parallel is quite resource intensive.

[10-Apr-19 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it currently takes ~28GB of RAM to run the list of assetchains

[10-Apr-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
with the latest improvements, the limit is simply how many fit on a single node. so the question becomes what is that number (about 100?) and how many systems can a single operator handle

[10-Apr-19 06:00 PM] Mark81#4505
Btc is biggest by blockchain size if ethereum is not counted (who nuthead is even downloading full?). How much blockcain size affects to resources or does it these days?

[10-Apr-19 06:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
ripple ( if that counts as a blockchain) is like 50 times of BTC

[10-Apr-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no genesis block to early blocks for XRP

[10-Apr-19 06:02 PM] Mark81#4505
It crossed to my mind too but its ripple 😂

[10-Apr-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
by definition not a blockchain

[10-Apr-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
I think RAM usage will be the bottleneck

[10-Apr-19 06:03 PM] Mark81#4505
What part clients keep in memory from blochains? Full blockchain or part of it?

[10-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
only part, but usually 500MB to 1GB

[10-Apr-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so it adds up with 100 chains

[10-Apr-19 06:46 PM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... What if there would be tier1 and tier2 level notarizations? Current notarynode network would hold tier 1 level. Tier2 level would be free for public and would have its own chain for notarizations. And it is of course notarized by tier 1. This way market and coin communities would have chance to choose between both options. Run their own notary service or outsource this to tier 1. I dont know if this makes any sense or not.

@jl777c do you think AWS will play a big role in the future

[12-Apr-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[12-Apr-19 05:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Shinzo Abe it already is playing a big role, because at Komodore64, AWS is our weapon of choice.

[16-Apr-19 03:40 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
@jl777c when creating a decentralized exchange would you do order book based trades where miners can front run the orders that are streamed on the order book..or do you fundamnetally like p2p swaps without an order book like say air swap is doing?

[16-Apr-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i did minerless orderbooks 4 years ago and that is the same basic design mm2 has

[16-Apr-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if there are no miners mining the bid/asks they cant front run

[16-Apr-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
also it wont cost a txfee for every change in bid or ask or cancel that you do. that alone almost makes mined onchain orderbooks DOA

[16-Apr-19 04:10 PM] Mark81#4505
What is komodo on-demand-block assetchain blocktimes?

[16-Apr-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
is this a trick question?

[16-Apr-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
you just asked how much time between tx in the mempool

[16-Apr-19 04:13 PM] Mark81#4505
No. I am just wondering what is minimum time between blocks.

[16-Apr-19 04:14 PM] Mark81#4505
Does assetchains wait before posting new block if last one was second ago.

[16-Apr-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses the diff adjustment and for a chain that is long dormant it would have faster blocks at first, but if there is a period of regular blocks, the diff will slow things down

[16-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Mark81#4505
So there is way to set maxinum period for blocktimes?

[16-Apr-19 04:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
an example is KOIN koin.explorer.dexstats.info  no block for about 3130 minutes

[16-Apr-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the max is very hard to set as if there is a lot of hashrate and it disappears, then what is the biggest differnce in hashrate before and after

[16-Apr-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if 100% of all equihash miners are on a chain and then disappear and then we end up with just a single z9 mini...

[16-Apr-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems a pretty extreme case, but it goes from 3000 Msols to 0.01 Msols or 300000x normal so it seems worst case is about 300000 minutes between blocks

[16-Apr-19 04:21 PM] Mark81#4505
I understand on demand feature but where i am getting is that period where transactions are constantly flowing in --> time then between blocks.

[16-Apr-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it will end up at one minute blocks

[16-Apr-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming constant hashrate

[16-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Mark81#4505
How hard would it be create variable blocktime for case when blockchain is needed ie. for games doing their things what ever it mught be?

[16-Apr-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not easy to just set a blocktime, but it could be approximated

[16-Apr-19 04:26 PM] Mark81#4505
In this case it would make blockchain more useful since transactions would propagate more faster when needed.

[16-Apr-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe an on demand chain with a faster blocktime

[16-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Mark81#4505
It could based into transaction amounts for certain period with blocktimes.

[16-Apr-19 04:28 PM] Mark81#4505
Faster blocktime would help.

[16-Apr-19 04:29 PM] Mark81#4505
Since it won't be problem with on demand blocks.

[17-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
@jl777c are minerless orderbooks less secure cause of the lack of mining incentive ?

[17-Apr-19 12:39 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
which AWS skills do you think are going to be the most 'on demand" in the financial/blockchain space?

[17-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
well the mining incentive doesnt make them secure, the opposite, it allows frontrunning, etc.

[17-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so not sure the question makes sense without more specific details

[17-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the prices are broadcast via multiple relay nodes to all the nodes in the network

[17-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
each node verifies all price quotes via the signature and utxo

[17-Apr-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not as if a node can be confused into swapping at a bad price

[17-Apr-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
like any network, a ddos attack would flood the network, but that is an annoyance/disruption, not a direct loss of funds

[17-Apr-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
also the relay nodes would be run by holders of the DEX coin, which incentivizes them to make sure the orders are relayed

[17-Apr-19 01:58 PM] allbits#5898
Does the CRYPTO asset also benefit (in KMD) from chains that notarize to KMD?

[17-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the economic value us much smaller than the BTC value, ie 50 BTC vs 50 KMD

[17-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is 50 KMD * number of chains though...

[17-Apr-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it might add up

[17-Apr-19 02:25 PM] allbits#5898
It might ;)

[17-Apr-19 04:13 PM] costa2439#3771
"also the relay nodes would be run by holders of the DEX coin, which incentivizes them to make sure the orders are relayed"

the more successful trades  there are, the greater revs the DEX holders get. so they are  motivated to run the relay nodes, so that orders propagate throughout the network
