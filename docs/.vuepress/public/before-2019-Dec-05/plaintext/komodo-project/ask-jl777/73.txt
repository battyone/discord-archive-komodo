Maybe after you've finished this first stage of programmable, secure, interoperable blockchains, you can get to this other level - unless you decide to take your nine wives yachting on your private jet with caviar

When I think about this from my non technical POV, I think an interesting part is "and no-one else can control the address". To me, this brings up the issue of where does the DAO run code. The only conceivable answer, is an account on a decentralized computer or something like that. So we're still a long way away.

had a quick read again on that interesting convo you said @jl777c  (even without me, the revshare is changed to a new address and whoever controls that would be able to distribute out the funds) . or not right ? they may not or is there away to avoid malicious ownership after you. very common in corporate  world where funds are mismanaged I know the convo has passed , but nice to see a solution to this thought of

How safe do you think the ledger is? Especially with regard to privacy? Do you think Ledger logs the addresses and can assign them to a user? Do you think, they save the IP addresses? 
I'm currently wondering how anonymous is Ledger? After all, the Hardware Wallet is ordered and paid for with KYC!

[23-Jun-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if the hardware id is sent with the requests to their servers

[23-Jun-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but all tx by ledger needs their servers to provide the rawtx to sign

[23-Jun-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
which means ip addresses can be logged and if they are keeping logs, and USSA demands they divulge it, likely to avoid being waterboarded, they will divulge what info they have

[23-Jun-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
thinking about this, it would not be surprising if ledger wasnt forced to log the hardware id, if they werent

[23-Jun-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but i have no actual knowledge about this, just guessing that they can easily be forced to log all this and divulge all the details, in fact with the recent FATF they are likely forced to divulge all such data to chainanalysis

[23-Jun-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is best to use a dedicated full node!

[23-Jun-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
still it can be monitored externally, but at least you are not handing it on a silver platter

[23-Jun-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
any valid address is fine, the important thing is that it matches the address you send to from the old address

[23-Jun-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
a small amount was sent to all the compromised addresses. send it to the new address you claimed

[23-Jun-19 02:17 PM] tryx#8532
ok, thanks , will get right on that

[23-Jun-19 05:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c would it ever be possible to think that High Frequency Trading will be possible over Decentralised Exchanges?

[23-Jun-19 05:07 PM] cipi#4502
i think it depends mainly on the blocktime of the involved coins... so BTC is out

[23-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
not the millisecond trading, one minute would be the fastest possible and that is nowhere near fast enough to count as HFT

James, are you giving out kmd dividends to supernet shareholders by any chance? Seems like a good way to support shareholders.

[24-Jun-19 03:44 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
If supernet can create consistent crypto flow regardless of the market condition, seems like a good way.

[24-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And that will create sort of a base line for valuating intrinsic value of an asset for the future buyer too

[24-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Maybe like once in three months quarterly?

[24-Jun-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the design is for the investments to pay for the operating expenses and the revshare assets to create the revshares

[24-Jun-19 06:52 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I see

[24-Jun-19 11:33 AM] Seko#7408
Thank you. I'm not accusing ledgers of evil, but the point is. They can be forced. So as anonymous as some people think, the ledger may not be at all. 
For PIRATE we need a pirate hardware wallet.

About logs of ledger, the question was asked (on the french CryptoFr slack) to Btchip the CTO of Ledger. He replied: "on a pas de logs, mais bon par d√©finition, on ne peut pas prouver qu'on a pas de logs, donc enjoy :tournesol:"
Translation: " we [ledger] have no logs, but by definition, we cannot proove that we have no logs, so enjoy üåª "

also i dont really think through things that often, mostly it is just intuitive and i just have a decent idea of what the solution must be, usually pretty immediate. the hard work is to get it to actually work and then iterate
