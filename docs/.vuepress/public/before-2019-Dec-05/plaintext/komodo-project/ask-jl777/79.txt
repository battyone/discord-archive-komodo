I hope that Bitmex research (and other exchanges tech guys) will do an article/review on AtomicDEX. The point of view of serious CEX on DEX tech can be interesting (and help marketing indirectly)

[11-Jul-19 08:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Hey @jl777c,  multi part question: can channels be used for atomic swaps, instead of waiting for confirmations the swap is completed as soon as it enters mempool?
And follow up if that's possible, any thoughts on using a mix of Gateway and Channels CC to make instant, cross chain atomic swaps for a DEX feature? Lock coins with Gateway and atomic swap the tokens?

[11-Jul-19 08:19 PM] phm87#7395
@Regnar when a tx enters mempool, before it is mined, it can be invalidated by another tx with higher fee that spends the same inputs. I don't know for your other questions, let's wait for jl777 reply

[11-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Regnar#6164
@phm87  Thanks for the reply, I understand that but assuming it's a risk you're willing to take in this circumstance (though I think double spend attempts would be frequent for atomic swaps) going off of these docs <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/channels.html> there is a method for these 'instant' before mined transactions. Just didn't know if they could be used as a method of giving AtomicDEX instant swaps of any cryptocurrency. Maybe eventually like the 0conf of BarterDEX in some way

[11-Jul-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
@Regnar they talk about replace-by-fee transaction here : http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/breaking-bitcoin/2019/mempool-analysis-simulation/ and the fun fact about antpool can also be inverted : you can mine your own block as I suggest to double spend it (and avoid to broadcast the unconfirmed tx before mining it). Whatever it is malicious behavior, I prefer to avoid any thrust in crypto

[11-Jul-19 11:19 PM] Regnar#6164
@phm87  Yea that was my initial thought but I found the chapter I was originally thinking of <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc-jl/chapter10.html> This goes much more into detail about the channels CC and preventing double spending meme pool transactions.

[12-Jul-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
channels would work for this, but the problem is that you need to establish channels between the two pubkeys that want to do a swap, unless we have an LN type of routing, but that is a mess

[12-Jul-19 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i think with completion rates of atomicDEX being high enough, most swaps can be though of as "done" when it gets started, so a GUI displaying it with a clock as it completes its steps should work

[12-Jul-19 02:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If i remember correctly, hyperDEX has stages 1/5 etc as it processes it counts up until done. Just like a CEX deposit counter.

'Project E-dPoS¬¥ : set up a dPoS chain for the purpose of notarizing other blockchains using PoS (run by KMD and KMD assetchains) Proceeds for dPoS could be split between stakers for maintaining their stake.  Thoughts?

[12-Jul-19 03:52 PM] phm87#7395
@Lumbi why not directly norarizing on KMD ? (Similarly to kmdlabs) kmd tx fee is very low compared to btc and about pos/staker notarization, I wonder if you send them coins after their elections (risk that the guy run with the coins)

[12-Jul-19 04:45 PM] Lumbi#8378
@phm87 yes I believe that would be more economical. It is another efficency of E-dPoS.

[12-Jul-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
Notarizations on kmd (kmdlabs) are pretty cheap, I don't have any stats but based on my tests, I guess it should be few kmd per year.
Did you take into account risk ? Risk for a pow NN is low while pos needs to use huge amounts involving risk

[12-Jul-19 04:49 PM] phm87#7395
If price is dumped, a risk exists: if too many pos NN dumps their coins, your nota network will be down

[12-Jul-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
BUT if you hardcode pubkey of elected pos NN and you cap the staked amount per NN, risk can be low

[12-Jul-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
But it would require developement

[12-Jul-19 04:53 PM] phm87#7395
This is an interesting subject. Thank you to talk about it

[12-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Mylo#8306
notarizing to KMD is open to anyone to create any notarization scheme that fits their project/use-case./ecosystem/consortium/etc.   some schemes will be centralized, some decentralized.

[12-Jul-19 09:31 PM] Helly88#3715
Well that's my opinion, I'll ask him discord.

 How he imagines the growth of KMD when it works completely independently.

 What advantage does it bring for KMD to create a sidechain for a project.  Do not understand the approach.

 Always thought that there are more sidechains in a project that has a positive effect on the main chain in volume and transactions.  But apparently it does not seem so what I read, which if a sidechain completely independent of KMD does not work KMD synonymous.  Unless I now do not understand the approach as it is intended

[12-Jul-19 09:33 PM] Helly88#3715
Hope someone can explain how this will positively impact KMD when sidechains emerge that are completely independent of KMD.

The example at the eth is not bad more projects are more volume and transaction found in the mainchain

[12-Jul-19 09:34 PM] Helly88#3715
I want to know what the added value is for me as an investor when I hold KMD and make the technology available free of charge to a sidechain. 

It is only because of the staking that it is not worth keeping KMD in my eyes.

hi Helly88, James wrote an article on this question <https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3>

[12-Jul-19 10:16 PM] Helly88#3715
This is a completely new view. 
Normally it should attract many new projects. Another problem will be that many shitcoins will automatically be interested in it. I hope the plan works. It would take another year like the end of 2017 where new projects come every day. 

The view that many projects are worth creating for the main chain I haven't heard yet but it makes sense somewhere. 

I can only hope that you the marketing really strongly boosts after the 15.07. 
People and big companies need to know how easy it is to create something on KMD. If big companies should be interested in it it will surely be good for KMD to be switched on.

[12-Jul-19 10:16 PM] allbits#5898
@Helly88 you may be in the wrong coin then.  KMD is designed to work for developers and users, not short term speculators. The ETH approach that you mention creates a situation that is impractical for actual use in my experience.  I much prefer the independent chains approach that KMD uses.

[12-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Helly88#3715
@allbits That's a matter of opinion. 
I think the ETH view is good. You make a technology available and that gives you a little volume and transactions. 
I think the system as ETH has it is ideal, everyone is willing to pay something when the technology fits.

ETH is not in 2nd place for nothing!

[12-Jul-19 10:19 PM] Helly88#3715
I'm not just invested in KMD.

[12-Jul-19 10:23 PM] allbits#5898
ETH ideal? You're not gong to get much agreement on that around here. I've just come off two days straight of testing out the app universe in ETH. Transaction costs and delays render almost everything impractical. It is a system that does not currently work for actual use. Maybe they'll fix it. But KMD is using another design - and it's independent chains. You won't be able to convince anyone to change that design no matter how hard you try.

[12-Jul-19 10:25 PM] Helly88#3715
ETH doesn't sleep. The updates ETH will bring will change a lot. Blockages on the main chain will no longer happen. 

Don't forget that ETH is not in 2nd place for nothing.

[12-Jul-19 10:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
because it has the "2nd mover" advantage ?

[12-Jul-19 10:27 PM] Helly88#3715
I don't want to convince anyone to change anything I just wanted to understand how KMD rises in value when sidechains come in.

[12-Jul-19 10:28 PM] Helly88#3715
The approach the more projects come the more the price will rise doesn't sound bad. Hope that this plan works out

[12-Jul-19 10:28 PM] allbits#5898
Maybe it doesn't rise in value, but we'll have a platform that developers and users love, like Linux. That's what this community is about.

@polycryptoblog but I do think they're gonna make it.

[12-Jul-19 10:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yes, but the question is, how long will it take ?

[12-Jul-19 10:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Sidechains in the proper sense,  add value through additional functionality,  independent chains add value through DPoW , MoMoM, and Dex liquidity

[12-Jul-19 10:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Example : DiceCC sidechain ,  statistically provided it is used it will pull coins out of circulation

[12-Jul-19 10:35 PM] Helly88#3715
We'll see about ETH. I am of the opinion that everyone who is in crypto should keep BTC and ETH is my opinion. 
ETH has very smart people on board who will be able to do that, I think.

[12-Jul-19 10:35 PM] yorklab#7270
@Helly88 
1.  Build a superior platform
2. Make the cost really cheap to launch a project
3. Make the cost really cheap to use
4. Now you have a thousand companies that need dPOW. Someone earlier had already explained that  a thousand companies using just one aspect of Antara will need to buy well over 1,000,000 KMD.
5. The larger companies will need lots of chains which mean they will need more KMD than the  smaller ones. REDFOX LABS is building unicorn (Large)  companies using Komodo and all those companies will be using dPOW.
6. Many of these companies will incentivize Komodo/KMD in some way. For instance: REDFOX Labs is giving Komodo 10% of their profit for development. Zaddex exchange has KMD as one of the main base trading pairs.
7. All DEX fees will be used to buy KMD.
8. 10% discount when using KMD on AtomicDEX
9. Some of these projects may monotonize KMD; like using KMD to purchase things from a store.

Any corrections/additions are welcome.

[12-Jul-19 10:41 PM] yorklab#7270
@Helly88  It took me a long time to see what the team envisions. Most of the explanations were "a rising tide lifts all boats". That was too general for me (and money others) having some examples makes it easier to see the possibilities.

At Neo the blockchain stopped several times for several hours.

With Komodo's independent Chains this would not have happened.

dw plenty of space for every project.  Eth projects can atomic swap to their own chain for application scaling and swap back for market stuff if they want.

[13-Jul-19 04:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Kmd offers flexibility, scalability, autonomy, interoperability....
These -ility words exist because of kmd scale out architecture.

[13-Jul-19 10:58 AM] Helly88#3715
That with NEO is an absolute exception, something like that did not happen with other platform coins. I wouldn't use something like this as a reference that NEO has been stopped once.

Question about the DEX, two nodes negotiate locktime of a trade, and the length of timelocks. This can be adjusted  based on chains, can this be further extended to provide greater 51% attack protection on trades? For example, set time to have specific number of confirmations for particularly large trades so that you can ensure the lower hash chain has less likelihood of being reversed?

[16-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Regnar#6164
Given the value of the trade vs the 51% attack cost of a chain, could it be possible to make a large swap, move funds again and attack the original deposit? And would extending this time window be an effective defense for that?

[16-Jul-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Jul-19 08:44 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I was thinking if a GUI maker/company wanted to build their DEX on this engine and wanted to include a way to protect from 51% attacks on bigger trades they could theoretically increase the locktime amount.

[16-Jul-19 08:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Assuming both chains didn't have dpow. The swaps would have to wait for longer, deeper blocks, before being completed
