Veruscoin just took KMD assetchains features, advanced them and they'll flow back into KMD.

I have set-up TXSCL notaries for scaling test, I even have a repo that generates the chains, and all the config files needed to start it automatically. It uses momo branch KMD, which appears to make every -pubkey= passed to it, a valid notary. with -pubkey enabled it needed 0.0001 UTXO to mine.

[29-Jun-18 01:39 PM] ProficieNt#3097
and so anyone can write the assetchain into KMD and then broadcast the merkle back on the asset chain?

[29-Jun-18 01:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to try and docker iguana inside the mining node container, and have a seperate JSON file/iguana network for each chain

[29-Jun-18 01:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This effectively would do what you are suggesting.  Auto creat a chain, and launch it with an iguana that notarizes to KMD, the only manual process is funding the KMD to the address of each notary.

[29-Jun-18 01:40 PM] ProficieNt#3097
how do you verify that the merkle is legitimately in the longest KMD chain?

[29-Jun-18 01:41 PM] ProficieNt#3097
why would you need to fund KMD @blackjok3r im talking about a system where every miner is incentivized to notarize their chain and the first to do so gets rewarded

[29-Jun-18 01:41 PM] ProficieNt#3097
and if you notarization isnt in the longest chain it can get expelled

[29-Jun-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to notarize to KMD you need KMD 😕

[29-Jun-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am talking only what can already be done with existing tools/code

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
yeah, why is that the dev teams responsibility to give out KMD

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you wanted to expand on that, you would need to write some new code.

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
its like saying satoshi should go an buy mining machines for the miners

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
its about decentralizing stuff

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Notaries mine KMD... which pays for notarizations

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
so that anyone and everyone can notarize safely

[29-Jun-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you had an external chain/iguana network for youself you would have to buy it

[29-Jun-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Buying enough so that 5% APR pays notarization cost would be the best way to do it.

[29-Jun-18 01:43 PM] ProficieNt#3097
the miners would have to buy it if they want their chain to be locked in and block reward secured

[29-Jun-18 01:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

@jl777c ❤

[04-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Mylo#8306
@jl777c  a short time ago you mentioned there was an assetchain parameter/feature for a single address receiving a "fee".
a)  is this testable in any branch?
b)  is the "fee" a set amount, or a "%" of the transaction.
c)  this "fee" - can it currently be a variable amount?  if not, do you see this as potentially do-able.

The use case is a franchise setup where the franchisor receives a "fee".  If the case for (c) can be implemented, the use case would be that the KMD value vs the BTC value vs the $ value  would be calculated by some data-feed (centralised or decentralised).

Failing that, would this be more useful for cryptoconditions looking forward?

Cheers

ac_perc, a specific address receives a percentage of new coins for all outputs on the chain

[04-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Alright#0419
it's in jl777 branch, maybe dev also

[04-Jul-18 02:44 AM] Mylo#8306
ah ok it's only on new coins.  thanks @Alright

[04-Jul-18 02:46 AM] Mylo#8306
i'll re-check transaction fee options, might be handy for such a use case in any event.

[04-Jul-18 02:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Also handy, thanks again - the tx fee increases the supply, which is also handy for managing inflation.

[04-Jul-18 02:53 AM] Mylo#8306
Had to re-read it.  What a powerful option.
-ac_perc=10000000 (0.1 as a decimal of satoshis, therefore 10%)
User A sends 100 EXAMPLECOIN -> User B.
User B receives 100 EXAMPLECOIN & 10 EXAMPLECOIN are created from the transaction happening because of the ac_perc.

[04-Jul-18 02:54 AM] Mylo#8306
and sent to whatever -ac_pubkey is set to.  cheers

[04-Jul-18 05:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its for taxation right? Government is -ac_pubkey and gets all its funding from money creation as a percentage of GDP.

[04-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah.  But i think it's useful for franchisor model where fees going back to the franchisor for services/platform/ecosystem maintenance, development etc.

-ac_pubkey = some_central_authority

or VAT SalesTax IVA Mwst UST however its called in each country.

[04-Jul-18 11:46 AM] Mylo#8306
or just any central authority -  e.g. sports league that wants to manage inflation of their internal gamification

[04-Jul-18 11:49 AM] Mylo#8306
i ran through an example where inflation was 12% per transaction.  it's far too much.  think about 10% inflation across the entire coin supply where each coin is involved in 7 transactions.  coin supply doubles.  it's a very powerful feature.  need to know more about economics methinks 😛

[04-Jul-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
0.1% will be quite an inflation

Looks like the Bitcoin Prime project is looking into forking the barterdex code to make their DEX

[05-Jul-18 01:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
Everyone forking our DEX will just be more publicity for our DEX

[05-Jul-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What ever DEX with the most liquidity will win , so if they fork it, they would be best to use the exact same back end. It would just be more like another GUI, which is good IMO.

[05-Jul-18 03:20 AM] yen-cryptolife#8131
Stupid question but will new fork DEX increase liquidity for the whole BarterDEX based DEXs?

[05-Jul-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Only if they dont change anything. If they kept the same DEX address that the alice fee is paid to, and the same orderbooks/netid then yes.

[05-Jul-18 03:38 AM] yen-cryptolife#8131
Got it. Thank you!

[06-Jul-18 05:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Mylo   You got it. Originally the idea was for a  method to do paper wallet style gift cards but prevent users from breaking stupid laws .  For your surgeon friend if I remember correctly.  But as we have seen  it can be used as a tax,  also  as methods to eliminate membership fees and associated collection headaches ( what I assume you are referring with franchising ).   KBS will be using this feature for sure.

because it will be easier to build when we'll have cryptoconditions active and are more tested/stable. so hopefully soon someone will pick on not just governance but many other different types of smart decentralised applications project using KMD CryptoConditions.

[10-Jul-18 06:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's an interesting model, as grewal said it's to be considered once CC are ready

[10-Jul-18 08:36 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah dash model is good, still one of the best.  but as grewal says, we can be very optimistic with what KMD-CC brings.

[10-Jul-18 09:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wonder, how easy or difficult it would be for other non-komodo blockchains to be compatible with CryptoConditions for Cross-Chain Smart Contracts ?

would it be like the dPoW feature adding to non-komodo blockchain?

[10-Jul-18 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like GAME did ?

[10-Jul-18 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand the pre-requirements are to have dPoW in that blockchain. That is 1.

[10-Jul-18 10:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is a project who can create liquidity for dex to dex is there a way to do it with KMD

[10-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Mylo#8306
@grewalsatinder from my limited understanding atm, ILP is streams of characters.  CC is defined in ASN.1 notation (similar to SNMP MIBS and HL7 medical devices protocols).

https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/

So in that page, you'll see that `amount` and `expiresAt`  are "fixed length fields".  Each field has it's identifier and type.

As a telecommunications example, using my CSTA knowledge: in ASN.1
```
0x02 = Integer

Codes:
0x80=Device
0x30=Sequence
```
And the format of a CSTA protocol string is:  Integer + Sequence + Length + Device + Length + DeviceAsString + More protocol functions.

e.g.
```
0x02 0x30 0x0c 0x80 0x0a 0x30 0x34 0x36 0x38 0x34 0x38 0x35 0x33 0x38 0x35 .........
```
In this case the length `0x0b` of characters that follow.  0x80.....
`0x80` + length of 10 chars counted in base16, then my old mobile phone number (0468485385) in hex ascii codes.

So in this example CSTA protocol can be decoded by any language that reads those bytes like that.

I presume, similarly with SNMP and our KMD-CC ILP stuff.

Hope this makes sense, and if you can confirm @libscott @libscott

[10-Jul-18 10:17 AM] Mylo#8306
as for dPoW requirements, i'm not familiar with how CC and dPoW are both required.  I think in the case of scaling across assetchains this was the way it was designed for many chains federating.

[10-Jul-18 12:26 PM] libscott#8867
Hi, If youre familiar with bitcoin’s scriptpubkey and scriptsig, CC provides a condition and a fulfillment which are similar. The first is a cryptographic lock of some kind, the second provides the data which unlocks. CC is a protocol for encoding trees of conditions, which would be a bit impractical to implement in bitcoin’s scripting language. The condition types are ed25519, secp256k1, preimage, message prefix and threshold (n of m).

[10-Jul-18 12:28 PM] libscott#8867
In addition we implemented an EVAL type so we can extend it with custom functions, to verify cross chain proofs and whatnot.

[10-Jul-18 12:29 PM] libscott#8867
In order for other chains to join our proof system we would need to be notarising them. And implement their transaction type in our code, or vice versa

[10-Jul-18 12:35 PM] libscott#8867
Youre quite limited in what you can do with CC, mainly because of the bitcoin data structure. UTXOs arent a good way to encode an application state, really. But what you can do is copy a payout vector from one chain to another, so you can do cross chain transactions.

👏 

[10-Jul-18 12:38 PM] libscott#8867
As for interop, the interledger protocol is an interchain atomic swap protocol that uses marketmakers. Having CC should make it easier for us to become part of that network.

[10-Jul-18 02:53 PM] libscott#8867
Crypto-Conditions libraries abstract away the ASN1 part so you don tneed to worry about it; This is the interface in libcryptoconditions which I made for Komodo: https://github.com/libscott/libcryptoconditions/blob/master/include/cryptoconditions.h

[11-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Mylo#8306
OK this is cool.  Might be necessary to get that #ilp or #kmd-cc channel going again - i think we want to get started straight away with exploring the current cc stuff that happens in scaling, and then start mucking around with making basic conditions and fulfillments.

[11-Jul-18 01:57 AM] PTYX#6840
Is this going to replace traditional atomic swaps?

[11-Jul-18 02:10 AM] gcharang#6833
Augment them. I think these cc are more for kmd ecosystem chains and other chains who implement similar functionality.

[11-Jul-18 02:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i still need to wrap my head around all this 😦

[11-Jul-18 02:35 AM] PTYX#6840
I like that cc are paid in KMD

[11-Jul-18 03:11 AM] Mylo#8306
CC is an open standard.  Basic common fields are cross chain compat

[11-Jul-18 03:13 AM] Mylo#8306
The recent announcement of the new ERC-1155 token where many things can be swapped at once is where this KMD-CC stuff will take atomic swaps on quick thought @PTYX

[11-Jul-18 03:13 AM] Mylo#8306
imo

[11-Jul-18 03:16 AM] PTYX#6840
interesting

[11-Jul-18 04:09 AM] libscott#8867
@PTYX no, wont replace atomic swaps. Atomic swaps dont require cross chain proofs, but you also can't do a multi phase transaction with them, ie, commit funds to escrow, [something], payout

[11-Jul-18 04:15 AM] libscott#8867
@Mylo re ERC-1155 interesting, do you know of any downsides? I wonder if it would scale as well as separate token contracts given the nonce parameter of Ethereum transactions?

[11-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Mylo#8306
no i only read the hype about it and thought, ok....bundled swaps.

[11-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Mylo#8306
so would a "simple" execution of CC be something like "is it 3pm yet?" -> send tx

[11-Jul-18 04:17 AM] Mylo#8306
or can you suggest another simple style thing so i can poke around (by asking you more simple questions) 😃

[11-Jul-18 04:17 AM] Mylo#8306
or does the scaling stuff have a CC protocol (burn?) to peruse?

[11-Jul-18 04:18 AM] libscott#8867
the burn protocol to send coins across chains is orthoganal to CC.. doesnt really overlap

[11-Jul-18 04:19 AM] libscott#8867
i'd like if blockchains could be like event loops, where you have a setTimeout function, but i havnt seen that yet 😄

[11-Jul-18 04:23 AM] libscott#8867
for the poker protocol we implemented a CC function which was: (EITHER (5 of 5 sigs) OR (1 of 5 sigs AND (timeout AND EVAL("poker"))). So either everyone agreed, or a timeout had to occur and an evaluation function over posted gamestates had to return a certain value...

[11-Jul-18 04:24 AM] libscott#8867
the question is what would we like to be able to do? 😃

[11-Jul-18 04:38 AM] Mylo#8306
How about something simple like escrow for 10 blocks and refund back to same address that initially sent.?

[11-Jul-18 04:40 AM] libscott#8867
You can do that! But it requires an eval function. Basically, you'll reject any transaction that doesn't wait the waiting period or has an output address different to the input address. CC EVAL conditions allow you to inspect a transaction, and if it's "wrong" you can reject it.

[11-Jul-18 04:40 AM] libscott#8867
which means you can constrain transactions to those that are "right" given the rules of your application. Not an easy programming model but it works

[11-Jul-18 04:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@libscott  would something like eval function work for account control.  ( restriction of an address ability to send or receive ). ?

[11-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
can CC make DEX smoother/faster?

[11-Jul-18 05:01 AM] libscott#8867
@polycryptoblog Not really, except if your address is a p2sh address... You can't restrict receive, but if the address is a p2sh which contains a CC in the redeemscript then you can achieve some kind of send restriction. Depends on the rules you want

[11-Jul-18 05:03 AM] libscott#8867
@Gordon Komodo i dont think so, but i'd like to have a better idea of what's making it unweildy in the first place. If you know someone who can explain it to me...

[11-Jul-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO opinion just from using marketmaker, the main issue is how it does its networking connections.... but its p2p, improving it would be very hard.

[11-Jul-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also I think james left all that side of it to nanomsg.

[11-Jul-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its a problem with nanomsg rather than marketmaker specifically.
