now what exactly do these colluding notaries do?

[07-Dec-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
they can publish a notarization for a (height + blockhash)

[07-Dec-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if ALL the nodes in the network have that (height + blockhash) it is validated, if not, it is ignored.

[07-Dec-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so what exactly does the evil notaries do?

[07-Dec-18 05:30 PM] sgp#7572
This example is simply to indicate that 13 colluding notaries have an opportunity to regulate the new block generation. I want to ask another question about how the network would work if these notaries have less mining power than the normal chain. If they have less mining power, would it just cause a hard fork and the two networks would operate independently?

[07-Dec-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no they dont have the ability to regulate block generation

[07-Dec-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be where you are assuming things that dont exist

[07-Dec-18 05:31 PM] sgp#7572
my understanding is that they would if they had the majority of mining power and had the ability to collude to create these notarizations

[07-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the KMD mining ability is totally independent from the notarization process

[07-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, for KMD, yes if enough notaries colluded they could control the mining but they could only notarize the public chain, so even then they cant double spend

[07-Dec-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
with 25% of blocks mined by external miners, notaries even if 100% collude, still cant censor

[07-Dec-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so colluding evil notaries on KMD (but not on any other chain) generate blocks, but they cant force invalid notarizations to be accepted

[07-Dec-18 05:35 PM] sgp#7572
> with 25% of blocks mined by external miners, notaries even if 100% collude, still cant censor

this is where I'm confused. couldn't they theoretically force a reorg to remove these blocks?

[07-Dec-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
not if it was notarized

[07-Dec-18 05:35 PM] sgp#7572
I'm talking about all future block issuance

[07-Dec-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
100% notary collusion would only get 75% of blocks

[07-Dec-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
now the colluding notaries are either notarizing or not. if they are, as soon as one of the external miners mines a notarization tx, the notarization locks the chain

[07-Dec-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if they dont, then there is no notarization and that is a signal in and of itself that something is wrong

[07-Dec-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we have the dpowconfs for "confirmations" field where it stays at 1 until it is notarized

[07-Dec-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you wait for 2 or more confirmations, you basically wont trust a tx until it is notarized

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, (that means all nodes on the network validated it) then the network will reject any attempt to double spend

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] sgp#7572
let me walk through the concern I have in individual steps

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[07-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Mylo#8306
dpow confs for reference https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html

[07-Dec-18 05:39 PM] sgp#7572
at the moment I'm only looking at the future block generation, not any previous block replacement

[07-Dec-18 05:40 PM] sgp#7572
the normal KMD miners continue on their jolly way, mining blocks as normal. they add new, non-notarized blocks to the end of the chain

[07-Dec-18 05:41 PM] sgp#7572
the notaries also decide to mine, but they do so on their own chain from the point of the last notarization. if they have enough mining power, they would be able to keep up with the pace of the normal miners. at the moment, this chain doesn't mean anything

[07-Dec-18 05:42 PM] sgp#7572
at a certain point, the notaries mine a block with the same or greater block height than the normal miners, and they share their malicious chain and the accompanying notarized block to the network

[07-Dec-18 05:43 PM] sgp#7572
nodes look at both the normal chain and the diverging chain, notice that one is longer and has the notarization, and thus reorg and drop the normal chain in favor of the other one

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
sure, that is just normal mining

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] sgp#7572
Does this make sense?

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] sgp#7572
yeah

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for users that are looking at the "confirmations" field, it stays at 1

[07-Dec-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and then if it was in the evil chain, it gets notarized and goes above 1 and now cant be changed

[07-Dec-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if it wasnt in the evil chain, then it goes back into the mempool

[07-Dec-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so , sure the notaries could maybe boost their mining by preventing their mined chain from ever being orphaned, but they still have to mine

[07-Dec-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a slight economic advantage equal to the normal orphan rate of mined blocks

[07-Dec-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
is this really the giant disaster to make you write such articles as you have?

[07-Dec-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
well the premise that all notaries will collude together is quite a remote possibility, so as long as there are no significant attacks possible it seems keeping NN spots open to all is the best way

So, the dPoW of the non-KMD chains is not affected by these malicious notaries mining because they cannot mine other chains to compete with miners.   dPoW is 100% safe for those blockchains.  no colluding notaries.

[07-Dec-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
also, if a notarized chain starts having regular reorgs all the way back to the notarization, then it becomes pretty clear the notaries are doing evil mining to boost their mining ROI

{Reactions}
☝ 

[07-Dec-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
even on non-KMD the notaries can gain a small bit, by orphaning competing chains

[07-Dec-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if the average orphan rate is 1%, this is a 1% boost of revenues

[07-Dec-18 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but it will be visible that it is happening and requires majority of notaries to colllude

[07-Dec-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is the big downside of dPoW, it seems well worth the gains

💯 

[07-Dec-18 05:51 PM] sgp#7572
KMD could configure its clients to not reorg under certain conditions, but I am also concerned about the possibility of an attacker spinning up a number of malicious nodes. What would prevent these malicious nodes from ignoring the notarized blocks and attempting to reorg further? I understand existing nodes could reject these changes, but how would new users know what chain to connect to?

[07-Dec-18 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the new users can find the current notarized chain by following the historical notarizations

[07-Dec-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so unless a new user is only connected to the attacker, then it will see  a notarization and tend to get back onto the notarized chain. however, when there are competing chains we do see some peers get onto the non-notarized chain for a while, especially if the alternate chain is longer. As soon as the notarized chain is the longest, then it reorgs to the notarized chain and is locked in.

[07-Dec-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not easy to maintain a competing chain without notarizations against the notarized chain with notarizations as one will reject the other, while the competing chain wont reject the notarized chain

[07-Dec-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
@sgp any other concerns?

[07-Dec-18 05:57 PM] SHossain#0007
Notary Nodes mines only KMD with easy diff, and NO other chain. They don't have power to reorg another chain based on mining.

[07-Dec-18 05:57 PM] sgp#7572
fwiw I don't believe I ever claimed that notary nodes have an easier time mining Bitcoin. I thought that would be obvious

[07-Dec-18 05:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@sgp normally "control over blockchain" --> The following malicious actions are possible:
1)double spends
2)censor transactions
3)mine empty blocks

Are you satisfied that a dPOW'd system won't allow double spends?

[07-Dec-18 06:00 PM] sgp#7572
To be honest not really. I understand that a built-in protection against reorgs past a notarized block could complicate things, but I don't see how an attacker still couldn't attempt to fork off at a past point, run with it and make it longer than the notarized chain, and then throw a bunch of nodes on the network to cause confusion

[07-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
they can do that, but it will have 0 effect on the network

[07-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
other than a bunch of `misbehaving peer` prints

[07-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Mylo#8306
you can't run longer than the notarized chain (as per your FIgure 3 in your article)

[07-Dec-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the confusion can be created, but ALL nodes will notice this as the "confirmations" field would be stuck at 1

[07-Dec-18 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
until there is a notarization and at that point the confusion is irrelevant

[07-Dec-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if you ecplise attack all new nodes who dont bother to check the explorer and dont check for confirmations >1, then yes they could be confused

[07-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
during an eclipse attack(if attacker is broadcasting >pow unnotarized chain), won't new nodes coming onto the network find the notarized chain anyway?

[07-Dec-18 06:06 PM] sgp#7572
@Alright wouldn't they find and select the longer one but only report 1 confirmation?

[07-Dec-18 06:07 PM] sgp#7572
for any sent transactions

[07-Dec-18 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
Don't believe they would, could be wrong

[07-Dec-18 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the eclipse attack assumes they never connect to any valid peers (somehow), eclipse attack assumes govt agency is controlling all your network traffic

[07-Dec-18 06:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@sgp you explained here how the notaries colluding will be able to drop an external chain. Even if we consider that possible, how do they double spend after this?

@gcharang i think he is convinced double spend cant happen

[07-Dec-18 06:08 PM] sgp#7572
@jl777c but if you're a new node and see two chains: 1 with a more recent notarization, and 1 with a longer chain, which do you choose?

[07-Dec-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarized chain trumps the non-notarized chain

and if you are connecting to nodes on the notarized chain, they are rejected the nodes on the attacker chain and wont relay that to your node

[07-Dec-18 06:09 PM] sgp#7572
well now I'm back to square 1 at being more confused lol. what if the NOTARIZED chain was the malicious chain? What if the longer chain is simply normal miners having more mining power than the malicious notaries?

[07-Dec-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we have seen some cases where a node ends up on the longer chain and rejects the notarized chain as it is not compatible with it, but in this case "confirmantions" stay at 1

[07-Dec-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain isnt evil or good,

[07-Dec-18 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it is valid or invalid

[07-Dec-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
now you can play games by reorging a chain if it doesnt have notarizations, but whatever the currently valid chain is on a node, is a valid chain as far as that node is concerned

[07-Dec-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if a notarization happens and it is valid (your node agrees with height/blockhash), now it cant be reorged

[07-Dec-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@sgp what scenario do you have where people can be made to lose money?

[07-Dec-18 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
other than they ignore "confirmations" and dont verify they are on the main chain

[07-Dec-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
I don't see any situation where user would have to verify they are on the correct chain from a 3rd party source

[07-Dec-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
if there node gets *1* peer that is on the valid chain, their node will sync that chain

[07-Dec-18 06:14 PM] sgp#7572
if an attacker forks an old block, makes the chain longer, and gets a successful notarization, it would at the minimum cause a lot of confusion. at that point, it seems that the network would be protected by individual nodes' local caches. new participants would select the malicious chain as accurate

[07-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
What attack are they performing?

[07-Dec-18 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but once the longer chain gets a notarization, that is the notarized chain.

[07-Dec-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the one thing you did find was that notaries have the power to orphan competing miners blocks back to the last notarization and have a much lower orphan rate

[07-Dec-18 06:16 PM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User I'm specifically referring to reorgs with two chains, each with their own set of valid notarizations

[07-Dec-18 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this economic benefit is <1% increase in mining revenues and requires collusion of majority of notaries and expenditures of 51%+ mining power

[07-Dec-18 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and it can be detected. so it isnt very economic and they will be caught. seems not a very practical attack

[07-Dec-18 06:17 PM] gcharang#6833
The very fact that a conflicting notarization came in, implies that the network is being attacked

[07-Dec-18 06:18 PM] sgp#7572
The difference is it for a longer history, allowing for notarization confirmations and double spends

[07-Dec-18 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no double spends, you keep making that up

[07-Dec-18 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
@sgp you need to think through the blocks being added to the chain and apply the notarization rules, not just make up that double spends are magically possible. what sequence allows a double spend of a notarized transaction???

[07-Dec-18 06:20 PM] sgp#7572
I'll have to make another diagram later to show you what I mean, but at this point I'm running out of time. ironically, it looks similar to the post I made earlier

[07-Dec-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant double spend a tx in a notarized block

[07-Dec-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
since the notarized block cant be reorged, it cant be changed

[07-Dec-18 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
which means any utxo spent in a notarized block cant be double spent

[07-Dec-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you can double spend non-notarized tx

[07-Dec-18 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but once it is notarized, it just cant be undone. we have tried and tried to break this without any success

[07-Dec-18 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the only advantage is notaries can gain a bit of mining ROI by the orphan rate, but that requires collusion that is detectable and actually 51% attacking a chain. no double spends of notarized tx
