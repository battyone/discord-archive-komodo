I know very little about this

[25-Jul-18 04:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
But you can ask more about it in the #cc-general channel

[25-Jul-18 04:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you are going to invest a significant amount of time testing and debugging it might be worth clarifying with @jl777c what you think you may have found and if it would be eligible for a bounty. If you do this full time for income I'd hate for you to waste your time

Emmanuel is there any web version for hyperdex ?

[27-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Hermes#6934
There isn’t , Dex are decentralized they exist in your PC and they are not hosted by a centralized entity

[27-Jul-18 07:23 PM] OTC1#6896

It's possible to make a decentralised web version

[28-Jul-18 06:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
although not planned in the near future

[28-Jul-18 06:01 AM] lukechilds#2707

[28-Jul-18 08:57 AM] lukechilds#2707

[28-Jul-18 08:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
we are planning for this in how we build mmv2 though

[28-Jul-18 08:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
so one day 🤞

[28-Jul-18 08:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
you would have to keep the web page open during swaps though, no way around that

[28-Jul-18 08:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
so client<->trusted server model still has much better UX

[28-Jul-18 08:59 AM] lukechilds#2707

[29-Jul-18 01:25 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
> `you would have to keep the web page open during swaps though, no way around that`

With the Push API we can wake the client application even when it isn't opened in the browser. The open question so far is whether a network of normal MM2 servers will be able to support a network of web-native MM2 apps. I hope we'll come closer to answering it during the MM2 port.

[29-Jul-18 05:41 AM] jusoaresf#3291
Wouldn't the browser still need to be open (i.e. the session "live") ?

[29-Jul-18 08:58 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
That depends. On mobile any app can be started in background by a Push notification, including the browser-based web apps. (The OS can stop a mobile app any time, so we needed a way to manually kick them up when necessary).
On desktop some browsers would like to do the same ( cf. https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declare_permissions#background; https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=402456 ).

[02-Aug-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810

[02-Aug-18 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it just adds a KV layer

[02-Aug-18 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if you consider having KV layer an advantage, then it is

[02-Aug-18 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
seems possible, it would be like SPV server for data

[03-Aug-18 12:12 AM] Mylo#8306
@Deleted User like NNs could write blockhashes in KV by their id or something, e.g komodopioneers_SH is [37]
so maybe [37_BTC,0349asd9hfisnfiuasnfiuheiufhsiudf] ?  and every NN did that, then we could all read KV.
Or every NN could put block hash of stuff.  And exchanges could sync KV and check against notary network 🤷 rather than the web api

[03-Aug-18 12:20 AM] Mylo#8306
no not an iguana replacement.  more like a p2p log

[03-Aug-18 12:21 AM] Mylo#8306
instead of this ```  curl -s  https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json  | jq '.[] | select(.ac_name =="CHIPS") | .blockhash'
```
look up KV.  no single point of failure (web api)

[03-Aug-18 12:22 AM] Mylo#8306
NN to check.  Exchanges to check they aren't on fork, time their batch payments after ntz

[03-Aug-18 12:23 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah or any chains that nota to kmd, like GAME

I think it would be great if SuperNet and Heat were aiming for more mutual collaboration... Supernet has Agama wallet that covers 95% of all tokens but lacks liquidity. Heatwallet strives to also cover many of the current crypto tokens. Supernet is for anonymity and safety security. Heat is for speed and efficiency. Both are Decentralized exchanges with universal wallets to hold crypto assets. Both offer ICO plans for private use of their tech in private chains. Both Supernet Komodo and Heat Ledger are striving to take over the ICO industry from ETH. Supernet does Decentralized ICOs Dicos... and Heat for Legal security issuances, ICOs, IPOs... The alignment is close to exact in purpose, but in their differences.. Supernet Anonymous, Secure with Dpow, with slow atomic swaps from direct wallet to wallet.... Heat Fast and high speed trading with tokens.
All ICOs on SuperNET and on HeatWallet with their private chains can be exchanged in both heat and agama wallets. Adding liquidity to both platforms.
-----------------
disclosure heat and komodo are in my top 5 holdings ....

@jl777c can crypto conditions be used to automate dividend payments?

[07-Aug-18 05:29 AM] Mylo#8306
a smart contract must be triggered by a transaction.  after it is triggered, whatever you want it to do. 
The comments for this rewards contract may be something of interest to you: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rewards.cpp

(if you can't wait for an answer)

actually i just read the docs, it's more for locking coins and getting rewarded - not what you're after @ph03nix , apologies.  But the triggering statement still is true 😃

[07-Aug-18 05:49 AM] ph03nix#3115
thanks mylo

[07-Aug-18 05:50 AM] ph03nix#3115
i guess what i was referring to was SN assets

[07-Aug-18 05:51 AM] ph03nix#3115
like once the barterdex fee account reaches a certain level of kmd, it pays out automagically

[07-Aug-18 06:18 AM] Mylo#8306
ok in that instance, and you can wait for a 'james reply', but you need a tx to trigger the contract.  the contract can then check the balance of another address, and then do an evaluation based on the result of that query.  if > threshold, go into the dividend logic - sure.   providing there is sufficient permissions to unlock the funds from the calling contract, again yeah it's all tx, vins & vouts signed by keys that provide the answers to the cryptographic puzzles.

[07-Aug-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mylo the rewards CC is about locking coins and getting rewarded, since its the rewards contract

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Aug-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
however, what happens after the coins are locked can be literally anything that can be coded. It would be possible to do a dividends contract, but I am a bit nervous about having to get consensus to the satoshi for thousands of payments. If your node is not current, it wont be able to validate it and if there is any problem with the DB it might go out of consensus. Maybe I am just being worried over nothing though as so far all seems to be in sync across the contracts, even after reorgs

[07-Aug-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
The bigger issue with DEX dividend would be the cross chain nature also from a practical point it just seems easier to manually trigger a dividend payout with normal sendmany transactions. then it sidesteps needing to deal with massive tx vector with CC contract

[07-Aug-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
for assets that are getting revenues to a single address, the easiest would just be to collect it in a CC address directly, which would have rules that only a dividend payout is acceptable way of doing a payout

I had a shower thought this morning, Since KMD has privacy on transactions, is there privacy on the asset chains, the smart contracts and information?
What about a partnership with Enigma?  They just released their test net and it would be an amazing logical next step for KMD to really make CryptoConditions take off.

[08-Aug-18 05:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts asset chains have all the features of the main KMD chain, such as shielded transactions, zaddrs, z_sendmany/etc

[08-Aug-18 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts smart contracts mostly operate on transparent addresses, but part of a smart contract could be "send X to this zaddr", and then the funds are shielded. But the smart contracts themselves, they are stored in the public part of the blockchain

[08-Aug-18 05:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So you've got the majority of it covered.  What about shielding the smart contracts?

[08-Aug-18 05:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
James can answer in more detail, but that is how I understand it. I just started working on the test suite + continuous integration for CryptoConditions

[08-Aug-18 05:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think that would help alot more people feel comfortable with real world transactions of that nature.

[08-Aug-18 05:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Enigma is basically doing that, to my knowledge.    Smart contract privacy.

[08-Aug-18 05:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
the final action could be "Send to this zaddr", and that person has privacy. But all the detail of exactly how the smart contract works, needs to be public so the network can read it, verify it, etc

[08-Aug-18 05:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I could even offer it to my customers if there was a way to run it through a clearing house to convert their monthly payments to fiat.  A Smart contract for autopay would be fantastic.

[08-Aug-18 05:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But the contract has to have shielding, or thats gonna be a hard sell in my real estate world.

[08-Aug-18 05:17 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As a side note, every time I think of KMD I just get excited for the future of blockchain tech and this project in particular.  Keep it up! 🎲

[08-Aug-18 05:26 AM] Mylo#8306
@FishyGuts if you sent me KMD by transparent address, then i sent your customer KMD by z-addr, all that is known is that i sent to an amount to a z-addr.    Replace "i sent" with "contract sends".  Your customer still has privacy.

[08-Aug-18 05:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So how does the smart contract work in a case where say, a client signs up for automatic monthly payments?  Is their information for their loan servicing contract kept private?

[08-Aug-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
need a bit more details on exactly what the contract needs to do. You can send payments to a CC address and then restrict how it is able to be spent. from what you describe, what is missing is where the funds for the automatic monthly payments comes from. If it is all funded upfront, then it wouldnt be hard at all. the rule for payout would simply be, every month pay address X, a certain amount.  And it would be setup so either your node or the receipient node can collect the monthly payment

[08-Aug-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the current examples are all variations on:
1. create a plan
2. add funds to the plan
3. payout funds the plan according to some specifiic set of rules

[08-Aug-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess we could define a payments CC, where anybody at anytime could create a plan and add funds to it as they have it. Separately, they would create/cancel? autopayments, which would authorize spending funds from the locked amounts

[08-Aug-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
this would allow to collect earnings into a single address and not have to worry about sending payments out

[10-Aug-18 01:47 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I saw this discussed a bit earlier, but I’m just curious the highest # of connections you’ve seen on a node, and is there anything limiting connections in komodo? I know you estimated around 1000. I started a komodod node with maxconnections=1000 in .conf as well as in net.cpp to see how many I could see, and hardly ever get above 90 connections, which I know there have to be more than that easily. I’ve done the same thing on that server with Verus and have like 875 connections.

[10-Aug-18 01:48 AM] xRobeSx#5136
No big deal, just an experiment.

[10-Aug-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I see 300+ on some nodes, but most komodod wallets default to 8 connections so it isnt highly interconnected, very decentralized

Hi everyone, ca333 told me on Reddit i was free to get assistance here. Last time someone simply banned me so i hope someone from the Team can help me out.

I just downloaded the test release and my OOT won't even show up in Agama Mobile dashboard simply because my OOT address changed.

I tried several possibilities but it looks like my OOT address is no longer connected with my paraphrase. Let's recall that i sended OOT not even 3 weeks ago.  Years of experience in IT Helpdesks but all that won't help me. 
I Feel so stupid all the time...

For at least 4 months i have been struggling with Agama.  Hours and hours wasted for nothing
