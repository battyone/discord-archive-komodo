or whatever percentage is the optimal balance

[10-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Slyris#2880
Of course, that's why some open mind company can love this concept

[10-Aug-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so the more the ingame coin is worth, the more this 10% to 30% becomes worth

[10-Aug-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is automatic, as the atomicDEX support is there for all smartchains

[10-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Slyris#2880
What I want is that we are ahead of it, because I'm sure and some that it's the future.

[10-Aug-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV we can do CC over mobile

[10-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah totally but we will need to communicate to do high level layers then

[10-Aug-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
though not yet as the full CC support in nSPV is only in the komodod nSPV=1 mode so far

[10-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Slyris#2880
To support all platform through an easy way

[10-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Slyris#2880
But it's will be really cool to do like a proof of concept and try to do a little 2d game using this economy model as example

[10-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Slyris#2880
Like a realy basic one (zelda-like)

[10-Aug-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
also if it is setup as a DAO, the game company would get a built in 10% of the profits (whatever that is determined to be), with 90% to the players

[10-Aug-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so fiat can be avoided totally

[10-Aug-19 06:37 PM] Slyris#2880
If we do it well, we could make a module that even the existing game engine could integrate or offer (Unreal C++, Defold Lua) etc ...

[10-Aug-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, done right this will be a very significant things

[10-Aug-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also built in support for NFT

[10-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Slyris#2880
If it can be disruptive and really compete against pay2win it would be a big win for the industry.

[10-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Slyris#2880
Many players give up when he sees a pay2win game

[10-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Slyris#2880
CC Rewards can be used too for achievement in game

[10-Aug-19 06:41 PM] Slyris#2880
I believe.

[10-Aug-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards just pays simple interest for timelocked coins

[10-Aug-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if internal game events are put onchain, then you can convert any ingame item to real coins or NFT

[10-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah like game event that appear once a week for example or once a year

[10-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Slyris#2880
Should be easy to configure a new event "prize"

[10-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Slyris#2880
If a game wants to do an event for Christmas but change every year for example it must be really easy to interact with the module that we provide

[10-Aug-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use oracles for that

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
define a "game event" oracle

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
only the publisher can define such an event

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, but again we will need to do it in a really high level layer

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the CC can then verify that the claim for an event is valid

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Slyris#2880
so it's really easy to configure

[10-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Slyris#2880
And behind we will deal with CC the right way

[10-Aug-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as all desired actions are defined, then it is implemented at the low level via CC and it spawns an rpc call. the "high level" would just be to issue the rpc call

[10-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Slyris#2880
We must put together the pieces of the puzzle now

[10-Aug-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
sooner is usually better than later

üëå 

[10-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Slyris#2880
So basically a game company would like to create a side chain with the name of their currency

[10-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Slyris#2880
and do some configuration about CC module they want to use on this side chain

[10-Aug-19 06:51 PM] Slyris#2880
alright ?

[10-Aug-19 06:53 PM] Slyris#2880
http://komodo.zogs.org this help me a lot to understand

[10-Aug-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a generic game CC that has all the standard functionality, it is a matter to start the chain with the correct parameters

[10-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Slyris#2880
There is a CC generic game file @jl777c  ?

[10-Aug-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet

[10-Aug-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be defined first

[10-Aug-19 07:04 PM] Slyris#2880
ok, i'm reding the CCDice.h and dice.cpp now

[10-Aug-19 07:04 PM] Slyris#2880
to understand the low level layer

[10-Aug-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
rogue is the most complex, but closest to what you are asking for, look at rogue_rpc.cpp in the src/cc dir

[10-Aug-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe tetris is a better example as it is much simpler and still gets ingame points to coins

[10-Aug-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the cclib.cpp has some built in game oriented things

[10-Aug-19 07:11 PM] Slyris#2880
for example the dice is more than 850 lines of codes for roll a dice alright @jl777c ?

[10-Aug-19 07:11 PM] Slyris#2880
I think it's not so easy

[10-Aug-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
writing the CC is not easy, using it is a matter of issuing rpc calls

[10-Aug-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also dice is doing mempool things that make it a lot more complex

[10-Aug-19 07:16 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i see

[10-Aug-19 07:16 PM] Slyris#2880
but from the developer side we have only CC Library, so i need to adapt to it

[10-Aug-19 07:17 PM] Slyris#2880
But it's really low level c so i need to focus a lot to understand what is going inside

[10-Aug-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think better is to define all the functionality you need

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Slyris#2880
i will ofc

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we then make a CC that has this functionality, along with rpc interface

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then all the C++ code has to do is issue rpc calls

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok i will do !

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
look at the TUI code, they interface to the CC via rpc

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Slyris#2880
ok thank's a lot james for your time and your patience

[10-Aug-19 07:18 PM] Slyris#2880
i will do it for sure

[10-Aug-19 11:16 PM] Pumtchak#0362
This is a very good idea @Slyris. There is a real usecase here. Im glad my animation http://komodo.zogs.org help you understand the komodo capabilities, but i made it to help newbies, not expert like you ;)

I should ask you before speaking with James about it

[14-Aug-19 01:13 PM] mox#5707
what's your opinion on blur and the team so far?

[14-Aug-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
blur has a good dev, but very small community still

[15-Aug-19 08:32 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c Hello

[15-Aug-19 08:33 AM] Slyris#2880
it would be nice to have a unique configuration file for the electrums it would avoid parser as many different files no ? (for the coins repository)

[15-Aug-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you could just create a single electrums file out of all the separate files if you want

[15-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah but i need to be synced i think, for the moment i will open and parse file

[15-Aug-19 08:42 AM] Slyris#2880
this is not a problem

[15-Aug-19 08:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
this might get you started - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smk762/pytomicDEX/master/mm2coins.py

{Reactions}
üôè 

[15-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Slyris#2880
do we have a garantee that the "coin" field from `coins.json` is the filename in the electrum folders @jl777c ?

[15-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Slyris#2880
so i can simply do:

```cpp
if (additional_infos.is_mm2_compatible &&
                std::filesystem::exists(std::filesystem::current_path() / "electrums" / current_element["coin"])) {
                additional_infos.is_electrum_compatible = true;
            }
```

[15-Aug-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
other than transient errors, it should be that way

[15-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok great. Thank's

[15-Aug-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c How we know if the electrum server is using TCP or SSL using the configuration electrum files ?

[15-Aug-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
According to mm2 api documentation i need to precise if i'm using TCP or SSL

[15-Aug-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
and if i want to disable certifications

[15-Aug-19 10:17 AM] Slyris#2880
cc @artem.pikulin

[15-Aug-19 10:21 AM] Slyris#2880
for example:

```json
{
    "url": "electrum1.smartcash.cc:50001",
    "contact": [
      {
        "github": "https://github.com/SmartCash/electrum-smart/issues"
      }
    ]
  }
```

I dont know how i can detect if it's SSL or Regular TCP that i should use here

[15-Aug-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure either. mm1 only did tcp, but i think mm2 supports both
