centralized development, some ppl want to make wallets.   there are pros and cons to each.   they eachhave branding, their own customer base & targets.   i can give you a mercedez benz in any colour as long as it's black.

[06-Jun-19 07:01 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes colours not Bugatti engine and yes this was just idea and maybe help we find solutions...

(CC transactions = application specific transactions)  e.g. games, healthcare, telecommunications, ....

@ronyi I actually had a talk with our CTO just moments ago, that a collaboration on a wallet "framework" would be good for security reasons. However, the issue is related to a NPM package, that should've been version locked - or maybe even fuzzed. I also agree with @Mylo - everyone has their own plans and own strategies.

[06-Jun-19 07:20 AM] ronyi#5719
I understand, but just was "lucky" coincidence, example Verus Enchanted used another NPM package('s). There will never be 0 security risk. Yes everyone has own plans and own strategies, but using same "framework" at once good and bad (more eyes see more). So far, luckily I haven't lost KMD or other coins and fortunately not even now. Thank you all members and handled this situation excellent! @TwilightPunkster K64 @Mylo  thank you

development is in progress for a Vault-CC that could have saved the situation, too bad

[06-Jun-19 07:32 AM] Mylo#8306
it's definitely a wake up.   put % into a multisig, put % in cold (always offline, never been on network computer) wallet.
satoshi developed change address in full mode with a lot of fore thought.  we can't exactly ask why, but situations like this make running a full node and learning the fundamentals much more rewarding.

[06-Jun-19 07:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
What we need are some tutorial videos. Educate people. Empower them. And of course: Vault-CC

a single wallet would create a catastrophic event if it were compromised, the fact we have 10 different wallets is what limited the damage

[06-Jun-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we would want more, rather than less wallets

[06-Jun-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
777 wallets

of course that is overkill

[06-Jun-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the method used to attack agama is applicable to basically every other project. we just got chosen to be attacked for some reason, i guess the hacker likes the long term value prospects of KMD

[07-Jun-19 04:53 AM] idrtis#7552
cant the attacker rotate funds via private adresses? if we can prevent attacker spend his coins then it means the privacy and cencorship resistance here does not have any value at all @bishop

[07-Jun-19 04:58 AM] idrtis#7552
thanks for the reply. what I am asking is what is the value of a privacy oriented decentralized network if the most of the network can decide and is able to prevent an address to be used.

[07-Jun-19 04:59 AM] idrtis#7552
or I should say 'operators' of the network instead of most

less than 1% of KMD was private tx and there is much more than a 1% chance of regulations making it difficult to maintain listings. already japan has forced zcash and xmr off of exchanges.

The decision to stop the privacy feature of KMD is a good decision IMO. We have sidechains for that.

PIRATE is the ultimate privacy coin with the largest anon set

we can start to discuss such things 10 years from now, i am not against this sort of idea, all depends on what the overall conditions of crypto is at that time

[07-Jun-19 02:37 PM] lion#5837
All this will be relevant when we have an easy dex wallet with an atomic swap function to buy confidentiality coins! Then there will be no need for special privacy of kmd! As well as the principle of interchangeability of coins - also suitable! But the question is whether this will prevent the adoption of a coin? We need a whole ecosystem with a variety of functions and private transactions are not the only thing needed from the coin - any separate integrated mixing protocol and the like can provide this!

[07-Jun-19 02:51 PM] gcharang#6833
@lion you could have been testing the dex right now if not for the Agama business
already a lot of the community tried it
it is in beta now

@gcharang  Yes - but I'm talking about a stable and already tested version!

[07-Jun-19 02:55 PM] lion#5837
Something similar in interface and convenience to a chainzilla wallet - only with a built-in exchange and with iron protection against vulnerabilities!)

that is what #coincollect is working on iirc

[07-Jun-19 03:01 PM] lion#5837
for example, Zooko from ZEC wants to ban unshielded transactions - I wonder how this will affect KOMODO

[07-Jun-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
not at all

[07-Jun-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
privacy is moved to sidechains and mostly to PIRATE, which has a larger anon set than ZEC

[07-Jun-19 03:04 PM] lion#5837
And it is also noteworthy that pirate Z-addresses are supported by third-party exchanges! And this is good news!

[07-Jun-19 03:08 PM] lion#5837
the pirate project needs only sufficient liquidity - which will work as a massive marketing tool and technology will be noticed by large masses of users and companies that need privacy!

I received the small kmd to my old address.  I have completely uninstalled the Agama wallet, and have now installed the Verus Agama wallet.  I've set up my new address, and completed the refund form. So my question is do I use the Verus Agama wallet to login to my old address to send the small KMD to my new address?  Thanks for the help.

[07-Jun-19 03:18 PM] lion#5837

[07-Jun-19 03:22 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
when all this happened the other day, I was able to login to the old agama wallet, but got the white screen, so I am not sure how I would send kmd from the old address.  Thats why I was thinking I could do this from the Verus Agama wallet.  As my name indicates, I'm fairly clueless, is there a better way to do this?  And if I should be asking this in a different area on discord, let me know.

[10-Jun-19 04:48 AM] alexoh#0560
Hi
I have a frustration, and I will ask again.

Since December 10, 2017, Agama has been loaded and has been dead.
At that time, I did not even know there was a wallet.dat file and just formatted it.

After installing new Acama purse, the KMD coin in my Agama purse is missing.
After that, the transaction history file after December 6, 2017 disappears. The transaction history for about 5 days should not appear at all.
At about 97.3%, it disappears from the last step.

The agama version used at that time is 23a. In previous versions, to get the interest, you had to do it manually (that is, when you send it from my agama to my wallet bitlex and then send it back to the agama)
However, the 23a version did not send it out, but the button was automatically pressed to add interest.

I've had a lot of chats here (https://komodo-platform.slack.com/), but all the chats are gone.

And while he was chatting, he told me:
"There are over 126,000 missing coins at any address."
I asked them if they could find out which address they were in, and they said they could not do it because they were a private company.

At the time, the only thing they said was that there was no way to recover wallet.dat.
I tried to recover the SSD from then, but I still can not recover it.

here ,
One of @Nabob, @PTY or me @ tarun.gulati admitted that version 23a had a lot of problems.
