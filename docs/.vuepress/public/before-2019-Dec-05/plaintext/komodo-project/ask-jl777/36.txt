likelihood of being able to pull that off is *slim*

[07-Dec-18 06:25 PM] sgp#7572
before I go (I dispute the above), do you have a formal analysis for your dPoW setup? anything beyond the whitepaper and recent blog post I should be referring to?

getting a better mining ROI by getting notaries to collude

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
checkpoints work to prevent reorgs past that checkpoint

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
you would need significantly more than 13 notaries to collude because notaries can't pick and choose who they will notarize with

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] peritonlogon#7708
@sgp there seems to be a lot of talking past each  other  here.  Why not just perform your attack and prove you're right?

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is not doing anything mathematical, it is purely about the implementation

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] SHossain#0007
@peritonlogon i wanted to suggest the same

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the formal analysis is that if a block is not reorged, no tx in that block can be double spent

[07-Dec-18 06:26 PM] SHossain#0007
try if you can double spend notarized tx and show us

[07-Dec-18 06:27 PM] SHossain#0007
he can also try that

[07-Dec-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries can suppress notarizations

[07-Dec-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but dpowconfs allows all nodes to detect lack of notarizations

[07-Dec-18 06:27 PM] SHossain#0007
how many nodes he can align by the attackers side?

[07-Dec-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
for attack analysis we assume 100% notary collusion

[07-Dec-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
we show even in that case, there is no meaningful attack

[07-Dec-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I believe I have done that but @sgp feels there is still some chart that will show me notaries can double spend

what purpose we have to collude?

[07-Dec-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is an interesting angle and we did find that colluding notaries can gain a bit of mining ROI to 51% mine a notarized chain

[07-Dec-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but it will be detected, hard to miss reorgs with every notarization

[07-Dec-18 06:32 PM] SHossain#0007
the way i see it is, my stay with mainnet and keep my nodes well maintained to perform better securing the network and mine my allotment of easy diff KMD. if i make it top 30 nodes, i get chance of be there another year. Moar KMD

[07-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c I still find that attack vector entirely implausible

[07-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
it assumes that there aren't honest notaries

[07-Dec-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but that is what attack analysis is

[07-Dec-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
assume the worst and if the worst is a bit of mining ROI gained by orphaning competing chains, with the expenditure of 51% hashrate and it is discoverable

[07-Dec-18 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is the worst, then you evaluate that it is not any practical issue

[07-Dec-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if a suicidal attack could do massive double spends, that is one thing

[07-Dec-18 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case it is an uneconomic attack

[07-Dec-18 06:35 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
devaluing one currency might make another one more valuable I guess

[07-Dec-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you make the worst case assumptions, find the worst attack and do a risk assessment

[07-Dec-18 06:36 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Then try to protect the currency form that risk right

@jl777c this has me wondering what would happen if we had two segregated subsets of the notary network both notarizing separate forks

[07-Dec-18 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright it would devolved to longest chain

[07-Dec-18 06:40 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512

üíØ 

[07-Dec-18 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but with the number of notaries, when there have been chain splits, the notaries stop notarizing as they cant reach consensus

[07-Dec-18 06:43 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
because you see Komodo block chains work on delayed proof of work. All computers must approve of the mathematical result before a transaction is executed.

[07-Dec-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically such a chain split will require corrective actions, ie. resync on nodes that end up on the shorter chain

[07-Dec-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
new nodes will automatically go to the longer chain, we have seen this

[07-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you end up on the shorter notarized chain, then you need to resync

[07-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but such things only happen very rarely and there is a way to resolve it, just messy

[07-Dec-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind all chain splits are a messy business

[07-Dec-18 06:45 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Komodo also creates a back up of itself to a different block chain, this is notarization.

[07-Dec-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what conditions?

[07-Dec-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
that is very unlikely, as notaries wont reach consensus if there is a chain split

[07-Dec-18 06:47 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
can this be prevented by making another notarized layer, like a back up of the notarized chain. Therefore adding another layer of secuirty?

[07-Dec-18 06:48 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
ah, i see.

[07-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that is very unlikely, as notaries wont reach consensus if there is a chain split

[07-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if it does happen, we certainly notice it and notary on the wrong chain, resync

[07-Dec-18 06:49 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
So, what are the main factors causing the notaries to reach consensus

[07-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
agreement about (height, blockhash)

[07-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if they have the same hash, they reach consensus

[07-Dec-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if by rare condition two chains are both notarized, the notaries wipe out the wrong chain and eventually all nodes sync to the right chain. eventual consensus after a messy mess

Thank you for this very interesting discussion, should we expect an attack on Komodo to definitively prove the solidity of dPoW?

[08-Dec-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been tried, but even skeptics now seem to admit that rewriting notarized blocks is futile, so now they are saying the big giant problem is that if all the notaries collude they can get a slightly higher mining ROI for notarized chains if they get more than 51% the hashrate for that chain. Of course, they will be found out quickly, and if it wasnt notarized they could just do double spends, but this is the worst attack so far discovered with all the notaries colluding to do evil

[08-Dec-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, our notaries are good people and they wont be doing any such colluding, it was just a thought experiment to find out what is the worst case

In this case it is obvious that the worst situations can be found in everything and therefore no technology is ever really perfect.  But there are solutions that sometimes remain the best in a specific field and this is the case of dPoW for blockchain security.

[08-Dec-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, dPoW isnt perfect (nothing is), but it sure is better than no dPoW

Key word there is *all*

[08-Dec-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a fantasy

[08-Dec-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and even if it happens the only financial gain is some minimal increase due to having to mine a longer chain

[08-Dec-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
for all that work it would be easier to just 51% attack and double spend a non-notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
chainB wont be accepted by nodes

[08-Dec-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
even evil notaries wont be able to convince them to accept it as the notarization already happened after the third block

[08-Dec-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
anything at or prior to the notarization will be rejected, by nodes that have validated a notarization

[08-Dec-18 06:38 PM] sgp#7572
Let's take diagram 1 and say a specific node saw chain B first. Would it reject chain A?

[08-Dec-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
first you need to realize the second slide scenario wont happen, as both A and B cant be notarized

[08-Dec-18 06:45 PM] sgp#7572
I'm talking about diagram 1 right now

[08-Dec-18 06:46 PM] sgp#7572
chain B doesn't have a notarization in diagram 1

[08-Dec-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, in that case a node sees chain B, but it wont be notarized

[08-Dec-18 06:47 PM] sgp#7572
right, so the node would accept chain B as correct, and ignore chain A, correct?

[08-Dec-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
chain B node will be operating as normal rules

[08-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
when chain A becomes longer than chain B, the normal rules apply and chain B node will reorg to the longer chain A.

[08-Dec-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
at that point it sees the chain A notarization and wont switch back to B

[08-Dec-18 06:49 PM] sgp#7572
all right, I understand where you are coming from there

[08-Dec-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so in a chain split, nodes on the non-notarized chain can switch to the notarized one, but not the other way around. this reduces the time it takes for the "eventual consensus"

[08-Dec-18 06:50 PM] sgp#7572
understood

[08-Dec-18 06:51 PM] sgp#7572
now on to diagram 2

[08-Dec-18 06:51 PM] sgp#7572
can you explain why a notarization of the second chain isn't possible?
