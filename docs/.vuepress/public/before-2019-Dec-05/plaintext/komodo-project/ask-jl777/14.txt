Hi jl777, There seems to be lot of new projects linked to social networking arising in the blockchain space (Steemit, AKASHA, Minds, Sapien..etc)
I could imagine KMD platform handling that scale. Is there a project in mind (or in near future) to tap/expand into that space?
Cheers!

[14-Aug-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is a decentralized ecosystem, so I wont necessarily know about all projects everyone is thinking about

What is basic function of notarized burn  protocol in scaling tech?  This sounds really interesting and would appreciate of detailed example. Thanks in advance.

[14-Aug-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
given a cluster of chains with a specific total of coins, if we can allow transferring coins from one chain to another without creating (or losing) coins, then the entire group becomes a single fungible cluster

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what the burn protocol does

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
burn it on one chain and import it in another

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
like a cross chain utxo

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the input is the burned coins on a different chain

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
this allows coins to move from any chain to any chain

[14-Aug-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
in the fungible group

[14-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Mark81#4505
every chain have their own burn address? On a new chain how coins are created?  Can chain run  out of coins if every coin move to another chain and any ain¬¥t coming to it?

[14-Aug-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is no mining, then yes, a chain can run very low on coins

[14-Aug-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the coins are created via a cross chain utxo

[14-Aug-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you burn the coins via opreturn

[14-Aug-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
this creates a "xutxo" that can be used in a specific other chain

[14-Aug-18 04:30 PM] Mark81#4505
Since this technology is in testing phase and not part of komodo chain scaling but would it be possible  to be used in komodo chain? Or would this be more like sidechain scaling technology?

[14-Aug-18 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be prohibitively expensive to do a million KMD tx/sec, that is 6000 KMD  per minute!

[14-Aug-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I think KMD should be where the tx chains are notarized to, and then the txfee on these chains are minimal

[14-Aug-18 04:36 PM] Mark81#4505
Most people that i see discussing this technology are actually thinking that its komodo chain that performs this scaling. They dont realize that it is actually one of tools for developers to have once they come into this ecosystem.

[14-Aug-18 04:38 PM] Mark81#4505
whole scaling debate has made people minds so one blockchain centric that they dont see out of that box.

[14-Aug-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it is silly to do million tx on an expensive chain

[14-Aug-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
who has a few million to spend just sending a million tx

[14-Aug-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
every second

[14-Aug-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody!

[14-Aug-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so clearly a different solution is needed

[14-Aug-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
also bloating the main chain by TB per hour is probably going to be frowned upon

[14-Aug-18 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you just cant ignore such "little" details when solving real world usage

[14-Aug-18 04:41 PM] Mark81#4505
How about if kmd chain input would be "burned" and taken into one of tx chains?

[14-Aug-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
going to the chain is much easier to do than coming back

[14-Aug-18 04:44 PM] Mark81#4505
how kmd chain would operate differently vs tx chain on that?

[14-Aug-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess not much different, just nervous to allow another chain to be 1:1 KMD, since anything that goes wrong on that chain would affect KMD

[14-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Mark81#4505
Yeah of course. Dont play with fire. isolate things and of course if komodo notarizes itself then it would technically notarizing itself through tx chains.

[14-Aug-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it just feels like great care would be needed and we wouldnt do this to a whole bunch of tx chains

[14-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Mark81#4505
a lot of can happen in few minutes and keeping eye on that would technically impossible.

[15-Aug-18 10:00 AM] Takoy_Nahal#7370
Good day jl777. I have a question. Are you going to release a mobile wallet Komodo and do you plan to do  in the future so that you can pay for goods and services with the  Komodo coin?

[15-Aug-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I only do core cli code, so I wont be doing any GUI, mobile or otherwise. but others do and there is alreayd a mobile wallet. please let us not ask me about GUI, or exchange support issues, or future BTC price predictions, or politics or religion

[15-Aug-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Takoy_Nahal yep, that's not a question for jl777. 

Our dev @pbca26 who coded Agama Wallet also coding Agama Mobile wallet. It works same ways the Agama Desktop wallet works as light weight cryptocurrency wallet.

https://github.com/pbca26/agama-mobile/releases

since it's in progress, you will be using it on your own risk, until we see final stable releases.

In short, work in progress.

There's more to Komodo Wallet. The things I wish to have in a mobile wallets is the capability to make Z transactions. I think for that you should first ask for it's answer from Zcash community, since it will be taken from the parent code fork for Komodo which is Zcash, and I heard some good optimisations and possibility of native mobile z transactions in updates from zcash in coming months. If happens, Komodo users can sure expect the same with such komodo mobile app. üôÇ

what makes UTXO model unsuitable for smart contracts like on ETH? or in other words, why must komodo currently use crypto conditions to develop smart contracts and what are the limitations? forgive me if this question is not even worded correctly.

[15-Aug-18 04:28 PM] KevinS#0577
is it that UTXO model can only support value transfer from the contracts whereas smart contracts on ETH can handle state changes?

[15-Aug-18 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH is a balance based system, so it doesnt really have utxo. bitcoin protocol is based on utxo, so it has utxo

[15-Aug-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CC is a proposed IETF standard, KMD is the first to get it live into a working blockchain. KMD doesnt haveto use it, but since we made it, it seemed like a good idea to use it

[15-Aug-18 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CC contracts are turing complete and as such it can handle state transitions or anything else that is needed

[15-Aug-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the differences are really more internal than anything else.I did make assets, faucet, rewards and dice CC contracts to demonstrate a hint of what is possible

[15-Aug-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can describe a contract and what state changes it needs to handle, I can write a CC contract to implement it

[15-Aug-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
turing complete means anything that any other turing complete system can do, can also be done

@jl777c thanks. to further my understanding what are the differences between CC on the komodo platform (not KMD) vs ETH? i was under the impression there were still some limitations for CC on komodo 2.0, but trying to get up to speed on motivations behind CC

[19-Aug-18 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
cryptoconditions is a proposed ietf standard, so supporting it is a good thing

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
we enhanced the baseline CC with a utxo smart contracts layer on top of it

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it is turing complete

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it runs native code compiled into komodod

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that means there really shouldnt be any smart contract that cant be written

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the motivation is to do smart contracts

[19-Aug-18 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Aug-18 05:45 PM] KevinS#0577
got it

[19-Aug-18 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as how is it different from ETH... it seems it has very little in common

[19-Aug-18 08:56 PM] KevinS#0577
but the end use cases are all supportable regardless of CC or ETH

[19-Aug-18 11:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think I remember hearing before about language bindings for CC

[19-Aug-18 11:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that correct?

[19-Aug-18 11:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
if so, how would that work?

[19-Aug-18 11:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
would you be able to implement CC smart contracts in high level languages like Python/Ruby/JavaScript etc by importing a CC binding library or using an SDK?

[20-Aug-18 12:34 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, that's correct @lukechilds .  currently only cpp (maybe c as well?).  there is another dev working on python bindings for another set of features, not sure about py-cc at this stage.  i'll ask next time we have a meeting, maybe this week maybe next.  
@KevinS where there is a reference CC smart contract called "dice", it is actually an implementation of a popular pattern: "challenge/response", so if you have another type of challenge/response scenario (eg i have a rewarding global maths quiz for children game), this is where i've been told to look as my first port of call re: the challenge/response mechanism.  this is 1 of the 4 initial reference smart contracts - the other is a simple faucet, another tokenized exchange, and lastly rewards for locking up coins (like a masternode, staking style of thing - which i have to be vague about because i haven't looked into it yet)

[20-Aug-18 12:35 AM] Mylo#8306
*maths quiz _idea_ only

[20-Aug-18 12:36 AM] Mylo#8306
James is going to start a new round of smart contracts dev soon, extending on initial reference catalogue

[20-Aug-18 12:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
This is really exciting

[20-Aug-18 12:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I can't quite wrap my head around how it can be integrated into a higher level language

[20-Aug-18 12:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
so for example if I was using JS

[20-Aug-18 12:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
with JS bindings

[20-Aug-18 12:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
does my JS code end up being compiled down to some kind of CC compatible byte code?

[20-Aug-18 12:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
or do I actually run a Node.js server and calling the CC lib functions is making some kind of CC TX and broadcasting it to the KMD network?

[20-Aug-18 12:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
or something totally different?

[20-Aug-18 01:17 AM] Crypto80#4884
Is this for real?

[20-Aug-18 01:20 AM] Crypto80#4884
Okay.. What I've been thinking about is how little we actually use crypto. And, will privacy coins be ready and do what they are supposed to, when it's time to really use them?

[20-Aug-18 01:22 AM] Mylo#8306
let's just stick to CC for now, not implementing server (nodejs etc.)
CC is binary (hex)  representation of data.  so 0x80 0x02 0x55 0x55 as an arbitrary value, is always that in hex.  It is interpretted by the CC protocol as meaning something.  For this arbitrary example, 0x80 might mean EVAL function, 0x02 might mean the length of the EVAL function and 0x55 0x55 is the value of the 2byte length of the EVAL function.  This is portable across languages because in bytes, it's the same.

[20-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Crypto80#4884
oh sorry, my bad.

[20-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Mylo#8306
The EVAL function/value is the ID of the smart contract: e.g. https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/eval.h#L40 are the currently defined catalogue of smart contracts

As for different languages, not sure how it would work exactly.  Maybe you compile your py/js/go languages down to a compatible shared object that can be loaded by komodod at startup (or with helper rpc command to load said library, like importwallet).  This part is just hocus pocus mylo babble.  You need the realjl777 and ca brains to think this one through üòõ

[20-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Mylo#8306
@lukechilds @Crypto80 
Draft standard: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04
It's described using ASN.1 notation which is used in SNMP (network monitoring mibs descriptions) and HL7 medical application protocols.
In both those cases, SNMP endpoints are embedded into equipment (usually low level language) but at the same time applications (and app servers like jboss etc.) can be MIBS for network monitoring information.  HL7 i know less about, but it's so an X-ray machine can talk to the application running on a DRs' computer to display the image which is transported from device to file storage, from file storage to application etc.  and then a related workflow is also tied to HL7 protocol stuff so the time sheet application can bill the patient record accordingly.  and similarly for nurses doing the rounds giving medication etc.

[20-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Mylo#8306
So similarly, once bindings to komodo's implementation of cc is available to other langs, we get lots of cross application, cross blockchain possibilities.... (with engineering work)

[20-Aug-18 01:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
very exciting stuff

[20-Aug-18 01:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah I think I'll need to see an example app to fully grok how it all ties together

[20-Aug-18 01:54 AM] Mylo#8306
contract side is one thing on the server, loaded into komodod.
app side is accessible via rpc.
e.g. faucet rpc https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/blob/master/src/faucet/index.js
but the contract is https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/faucet.cpp
faucet.cpp compiles to 0x22 0x50 0x........

your go/py/js serverside stuff smart contract which interacts with blockchain/wallet/transactions/utxo compiled down to 0x22 0x50 0x....... can be loaded by komodo.  it's the same bytes.  just at the high level was written differently, compiled down.

you provide an rpc to your smart contract functions.

app developers use your rpc and smart contract to write apps.

if that makes things a bit clearer.

you don't run a server along with komodod - there is no interactivity with an external server.  your smart contract just was written in a different lang for your own preference, and compiled down to bytes (that could have been written by another language).  "byte code" is the same.
the smart contract interacts with blockchain data/tx/etc.

if you are thinking to poll an external service for data to input into contract stuff, then which node would poll?  which node would insert into blockchain?  this is not the (ideal) architecture for a smart contract blockchain app.   the smart contract relies on blockchain data, so you'd need to find another way to get the data into the blockchain.  if you publish too many times into the blockchain then, which is the authoritative data?  how large would the data bloat the chain. your options for this line of thinking is either via oracle network or something.

that's my 2c.  sorry to flood channel üòÉ

[20-Aug-18 02:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
Oh wait, I think I get it, so I can write my CC in JS e.g an echo function, using the JS bindings, which compiles down to HEX, which I then broadcast to the KMD network (as a special transaction?).

Then I can build a web page that makes RPC requests to a local KMD daemon to interact with the CC. And the RPC request would be something like `{ccaddress: address, command: 'echo', value 'helloworld'}`

Something like that?

[20-Aug-18 02:15 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes something like that.
Except first step.  Yes you compile down.  Yes you then have your node with the CC smart contract you wrote.  But other nodes won't have it to reference except the tx they'll know, but won't know anything to do with it because they haven't got it installed in their node.  Each node then needs your special smart contract.

Might not be relevant to the KMD main chain to know about LukesJSEchoCCSmartContract (i mean it could, but unlikely), but some AC use case your smart contract solves can load your contract at start up - and decentralize/trustless verify the tx on it's own.

[20-Aug-18 02:16 AM] Mylo#8306
And yes, you make an RPC available for app developers to interact with your smart contract üòÉ
