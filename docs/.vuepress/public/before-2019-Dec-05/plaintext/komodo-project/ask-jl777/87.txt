Hi,
Would it  be technically possible to dPow KMD (only KMD, not SC or 3p) to 2 chains at once?

[01-Sep-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but its pointless IMO.

[01-Sep-19 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You would only be making an extra external referance... it cannot be 2 serperate notarizations all thogether.

[01-Sep-19 02:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because they would conflict at times and cause each other to be invalid.

@jl777c do u ever see governments use blockchain when it comes to lets say tax related things? At this moments politics often say we gonna do this with 1 billion dollars but in the end only 250m gets used of the supposed 1 bil. If they would set fixed parameters with time lock before it can get edited next time.

@jl777c I don't know if you heard about PoolTogether (www.pooltogether.us), but I think it's an awesome Idea and would fit perfectly with Komodo, giving everyone ("the small people") a chance to win without losing....

[05-Sep-19 09:04 AM] Mylo#8306
yes someone can build this using tokens (as the lottery ticket) and locking up KMD for monthly rewards.
lock up 30x1000KMD for a daily 5KMD prize of the rewards claim.

the winner can be selected randomly from the transactions of issuing the lottery tickets.

[05-Sep-19 09:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I am going to advise against any lottery tied to mainchain

[05-Sep-19 09:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s just a quagmire in pretty much every country unless done through a NPO, and even then there are restrictions

[05-Sep-19 09:16 AM] wl#4107
I thought it'd be a good idea because of the -no losing- part, there are no risks involved, therefore it wouldn't present a risk as any of the traditional lotteries...

[05-Sep-19 09:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Chance consideration and prize make a lottery .  While you “win” your money back, you had to front up the DAI ( in the pooltogether example ) first.  That would be consideration.

[05-Sep-19 09:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not against games just warning against potential missteps that may occur,  it is a good idea though just needs to be thought of how to be done legally ,  if you were unaware decred is facing some issue because of their staking system because it is somewhat like a lottery.

@jspook16 You asked: Is Beam be compatible with mm2 swaps? 

> Beam needs to be BTC-compatible, understand API calls like `senddrawtransaction`, `gettxout` and so on...
> Or a dev needs to make Beam work with mm2
> Also it has to have (something like) BIP65 implemented

You can maybe check this with a Beam developer.

Just found (slowpoke!) that btc has a backdoor for actually destroying coins. By not spending fees of mined block. Is it reproducible in kmd coins?

[17-Sep-19 11:23 PM] kolo#1111
Not in the form of sending to fake address, those are unspendable, but not burnt. Above actually remove btc from existence.

Hey @jl777c what do you think will be the biggest application for blockchain? Whether it would be currency, IoT, oracles, or something else entirely. What do you see as Komodo's greatest area of opportunity, and do you think the Komodo of today is well positioned to succeed there?

*transactions* -  by software/machines, bots, games, voting etc.    anything with an invoice or line item, any exchange.  it's the monetization of the web, digital assets & tokens.   from the abacus with roman numerals that couldn't do division, to the change to the hindu-arabic number system & double entry accounting that is about 430 years old.   blockchain's first application was bitcoin currency, like email to the web.   now streaming vids - in the future streaming payments.

[18-Sep-19 03:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's an intrinsicly superior system for so many applications. It is a complete certainty to me that any digitally distributed system where trust is necessary to operate can and will be replaced by trustless tech because it's faster, cheaper, and better.

@Regnar just like it would not have been possible to predict that cat videos would be the most popular usage of the internet, i dont think it is possible to predict what will be the equivalent for crypto. also, it becomes a meaningless question, as i dont think you can answer what the biggest application for the internet is. it just permeates everything

@jl777c im talking about solutions when coins actually removed from system. Not sent to unspendable address where they account for circulating supply. See link above - unclaimed miners fee cease to exist. Can we get same function as a function?

[18-Sep-19 06:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
note sure if this helps.
on KMD and any assetchain if you send the coins the the official null priv key burn address the coins are removed from the circ. supply. 
Which for any coin is always a calculation of premine + blockreward

[18-Sep-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
since unspent utxo become txfee and txfee goes to miners, something about that would need to be changed

[19-Sep-19 12:33 AM] kolo#1111
In btc miners when constructing coinbase tx are allowed to not account txfees at all, so this satoshis (10+ btc according article) disappear. It’s interesting, first of all and also can break some system relaying in fact supply never decreases.

[19-Sep-19 12:35 AM] kolo#1111
I have huge theoretical interest, because supply never decreases, and unspendable address is just one more existing input, which will never be spent, not that interesting 🙂

[19-Sep-19 12:36 AM] kolo#1111
Tl;dr definitive way to destroy vs unspendable inputs as useful, but non definitive
