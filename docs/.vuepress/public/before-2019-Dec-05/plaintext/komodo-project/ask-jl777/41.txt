and if there are no valid notarizations, the local node can rely on the dpowconfs method to detect there is some network event happening

[20-Dec-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html

[20-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
recent discussions show that more confusion can be created by notaries if they ignore the delay, so I am considering adding the delay requirement to the consensus rules.

[20-Dec-18 07:36 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
How do nodes determine the dpos-conf number? That'd require going off of the GC chain right? Like using a block explorer or that SPV method I said

[20-Dec-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses the locally validated notarizations

[20-Dec-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so if invalid notarizations are submitted, the dpowconfs "confirmations" stays at 1

[20-Dec-18 07:37 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Also what do you mean about the delay?

[20-Dec-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarizer p2p protocol adds a delay before notarizing, usually 10 blocks

[20-Dec-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this allows the network to reach consensus normally and get 10 blocks deep

[20-Dec-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if a chain fork in parallel does not resolve after 10 blocks, then it seems there is a viable chain split happening and in such a case, the odds are very good that the notaries wont reach consensus

[20-Dec-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
without the delay, it would allow evil notaries to get a chain that hasnt reached full consensus yet to be the notarized chain

[20-Dec-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems to be most of the attack scenarios people have come up with.

[20-Dec-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
we never had had any evil notary, let alone a majority colluding group of notaries, so this has not been any issue, but we could make it even theoretically impossible by requiring a 10 block (or 10 minutes worth) delay for a notarization to be valid

[20-Dec-18 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
a bit nervous about such a change as i can see in some cases not all nodes will be in consensus

[20-Dec-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
"fixing" these theoretical attacks can actually make things worse....

[20-Dec-18 07:44 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Ah, interesting. So that'd also resolve the issue in a chain split where no notary is malicious, but they disagree because their node is synced to a different fork

[20-Dec-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that case is already solved

[20-Dec-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries run a stochastic protocol where the big majority needs to be in sync 100% or the notarization round fails

[20-Dec-18 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so we see during times of an ongoing 51% attack, the notarizations slow down or stop as the network splits, then when it resolves, notarizations start again

[20-Dec-18 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why we came up with dpowconfs, to allow nodes to detect the network problems and to not transact any large amounts during this time

[20-Dec-18 07:49 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
How does the network resolve a major split, developer intervention/blessing of one side of the chain?

[20-Dec-18 07:49 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
ie, does it require developers or someone talking to the notaries to get notarization back to operation?

[20-Dec-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the only case where that would be needed if two different chains get notarized, which is quite unlikely and even in such a case (it happened once due to not all notaries having updated in time for hardfork), eventually it resolves itself.

[20-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the miners are extending the notarized chain, it resolves very quickly, faster than normal as once you switch to the notarized chain, you dont switch back.

[20-Dec-18 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is "sticky"

[20-Dec-18 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
in the once case where multiple chains got notaries, we had all the notaries on the wrong chain to sync to the correct one and once that happened the rest of the network has an easier time to converge. but conflicting notarization is not anything that can be done without being notcied, it creates a messy situation

[20-Dec-18 07:54 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
interesting. So in case of a chain split involving some programming bug that allowed both chains to be valid depending on network view. The devs could release some bug fix that invalidates the other fork. Notaries upgrade to that new wallet. They then begin notarizing the now only valid chain. Users with old software could then start seeing the notarizations and get pulled back onto the proper chain

[20-Dec-18 07:55 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Super interesting concept. Wonder if it could be exploited for a new type of fork in between soft and hard

[20-Dec-18 07:56 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Is there some communication channel for the notary nodes to be informed of a hard fork or other need to upgrade chain software?

[20-Dec-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there are comms channels for notaries, it is its own sub-community that is quite active

[20-Dec-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the incentives are setup for the notaries to want to notarize as much as possible

[20-Dec-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so their game theory is to run the compatible notarizing p2p code

[20-Dec-18 07:59 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
And these chain proofs... They're submitted to KMD network and then eventually make it into BTC. Does this work by BTC basically containing a proof of the overall KMD network? Or are multiple BTC proofs submitted for each blockchain/other notary operation? I assume the former, but just making sure

[20-Dec-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD notarizes to BTC which notarizes all tx on the KMD chain

[20-Dec-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
other chains notarize to KMD via tx, which was notarized when KMD is notarized

[20-Dec-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the former

[20-Dec-18 08:00 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
That's what I was figuring. So to authenticate a proof on BTC, you'd also need to authenticate it on KMD

[20-Dec-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the KMD notarization would have a BTC txid, which can be checked on BTC

oh ok. Probably be back sometime later with more questions. Super interesting concepts here. Could even be something to consider for Qtum, though I'm not sure the 1 hard fork per year is something easy to sell, even if there's already at least 1 fork per year scheduled

[20-Dec-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the alternative is to have some dynamically updated process to update the notaries

[20-Dec-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but that would mean the dynamic update being 100% correct. maybe we can work on that together?

[20-Dec-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I had an initial implementation of ratifying a new slate, but that was 2 years ago and it wasnt reaching the ratification threshold, since then many notarizer aspects were improved so maybe it would work now, but we are doing annual hardforks for other things anyway

[20-Dec-18 08:11 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
we have some tech that could be used for that. Unfortunately very poorly documented, but it's called decentralized governance protocol. Basically a way to change certain parameters on chain through a smart contract that implements voting.... The problem is who votes to change to the new keys and controls that power, even if it was restricted to only being changed at some certain time every year

[20-Dec-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I used the notaries themselves to ratify the new slate of notaries

[20-Dec-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why 50% of them are automatically reelected so we always have notaries who want to ratify the new slate

[20-Dec-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely willing to work with you to get a dPoW2.0 for QTUM

[20-Dec-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess for QTUM you would have the QTUM stakeholders to approve a new slate

[20-Dec-18 08:14 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Well if it's always pegged to Komodo, it'd make the most sense for the previous notaries to be the voters, maybe with 75% requirement or something like that

[20-Dec-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, they could vote on the QTUM blockchain using their pubkeys to be validated. ok, that works

[20-Dec-18 08:16 PM] 🄴🄰🅁🄻🅉#5039
Anyway, talk later. Have to work on some other stuff now

[20-Dec-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe a bit lower than 75% as if such a super majority cant be achieved, it wont be able to be updated.

[20-Dec-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-Dec-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
@stefjazar following from beam.mw site (it is alternate implementation to grin):
BEAM will support around 17 transactions per second. While this number is higher than Bitcoin and existing privacy coins, it is important to emphasize that it is not high enough to use BEAM as means of exchange. In the future, it will be possible to improve transaction throughput by using a second layer out-of-chain solution such as Lightning, Thunderella or similar. Then you should be able to pay for your lattes with BEAM. Until then, BEAM’s primary use case is store of value rather than day-to-day payments.

In BEAM, one block will be created approximately every minute. Each block will contain around 1000 transactions.

Instead of storing the full transaction history as in Bitcoin and other coins, a BEAM node only needs to store the current UTXO state, instead of entire transaction history. Validity of the history that brought us to this state can be confirmed by storing only the headers of the previous blocks which hold the proof of validity of previous states (using a structure called a Merkle tree) and Proof of Work that allows to reach consensus on which of the header chains should be considered the correct one in case of blockchain branching. This is achieved using cut-through, one of the core concepts in Mimblewimble.
We are still experimenting and evaluating, but it is a reasonable estimate that BEAM blockchain will be around 1/3 of Bitcoin’s blockchain or less (assuming the same amount of activity).

just for comparison, how many tx/s can Pirate pull off right now?

[22-Dec-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
approx the same

[22-Dec-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
tx/s is very dependent on how many zutxo per tx,  it is more like 30 zutxo/sec throughput, which can be 30 tx/sec, 15 tx/sec 5 tx/sec, all depending on average zutxo per tx

[22-Dec-18 05:27 PM] crumb#2550
