what do you mean?

[26-Feb-19 02:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Shinzo Abe  meaning that you don‚Äôt have to wait for a chance of it being sidechained on BTC , it‚Äôs being done here on KMD

[26-Feb-19 02:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

@Shinzo Abe the ability to run a BTC side chain assetchain with mimble wimble

[26-Feb-19 03:41 PM] sidhujag#3327
There‚Äôs no real good way to do a bitcoin side chain because it‚Äôd require big changes in bitcoin which aren‚Äôt soft forkable

[26-Feb-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
using a gateways method for securing deposits in a federated multisig, it is something that would reasonably secure. certainly not for any long term storage, but for some active usage it seems adequate

[26-Feb-19 04:15 PM] sidhujag#3327
The only problem is if the federation goes away after 10 years or disappears it‚Äôs just an obvious problem and attack vector but yea I think that‚Äôs what liquid is all about

[26-Feb-19 04:16 PM] sidhujag#3327
Short term use yup just take the risk and use it

[26-Feb-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, only for active usage is it recommended

Alas.

[05-Mar-19 01:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I undersand that a good, secure and efficient application code should have as much less reliance on 3rd party libraries as possible.
And in case it is too much of work to do what those 3rd party libraries are providing, only the needed bits of those 3rd party libraries must be used with own source code for efficient code writing.
Please correct me on this understanding if it needs correction.

**What I want to ask is what happens if the 3rd party code we enherit has some bugs or vulnerabilities, how you choose the libraries for such situations?**

I observed you coding `iguana` and know from those days how many things you scrapped because those were not as efficient and bulky if just used 3rd party libraries. You had those 3rd party libraries kinda disassmbled and only used the bits which were useful to your code.

Okay, so I guess using the code which has been stable for long

[05-Mar-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and by including it at the source level, it isnt subject to automatic updates when some external repo updates a binary lib

[05-Mar-19 11:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
exactly. Learned by watching your way of coding and did the exact same with my kmdgo package.
I just copied the `btcec`, `chaincfg`, `base58`, `bech32` and `wire` (btc protocol messages) from BTCSuite Go code to mine, instead of setting/calling it as `import` from github.
At this moment my Go code doesn't rely on other packages, and I intend to even trim these copied packages down further as I keep studying and understanding the blockchain side of go code.

```The problem with having many condition types is that all intermediaries in a certain path would need to support the same algorithms in order for them to be usable. That meant that the only algorithms you could rely upon having support for would be the least common denominator. Most likely, this would come down to simple SHA256 hash-locks. Less than 20% of the functionality could serve more than 80% of the use cases, and so the Interledger standard parted ways with Crypto Conditions.```

If without CC and for lol dota and etc - you can take any CEX skins trading platform and just add crypto payments I think

[08-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Mylo#8306
@ph03nix yes.  CC can do pretty much anything.   if it can be made into a piece of software, it can be included in the consensus validated by all nodes.
if tetris 2 player, like a puzzle fighter genre game and we play.  the outcome of the game is a blockchain result of the game.   this outcome can be used as an input for some computation.

[08-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Mylo#8306

I have a question. I'm wondering if the dPOW mechanism could be threaded around a crypto such as digibyte? Would it not be a lot cheaper for the blockchain security notarizations? I've heard that the Bitcoin notorization fees are as high as 2-10 btc per year or more and this might be an issue when btc surpasses $100k in price?

[14-Mar-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
we did an ICO exactly so we can be immune to BTC prices. also what point is notarizing to DGB if its hashrate is 0.000001% of BTC?

[14-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Mark81#4505
No point but yes its possible.

Craig Wright is currently working on a technology to make the transactions of so-called 'privacy coins' such as Monero or ZCash traceable. What do you think? Is it realistic?

maybe for monero, especially with most all the early tx traceable. i have no idea how anybody would make zcash completely traceable. maybe he has a quantum computer from the future, i think that is what would be needed.

[15-Mar-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind he has not delivered on any of this tech promises, so why would people think he can get anything done?

[15-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Seko#7408
If he realizes that with Zcash, how realistic would Pirate be?

[15-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Seko#7408
Honestly, I don't know him.  I haven't been around long, but it's enough to know that so many people have not kept so many promises and announcements.  It's like with the Detox album of Dr. Dre.
