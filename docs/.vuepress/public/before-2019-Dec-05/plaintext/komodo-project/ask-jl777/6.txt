Okay, if you go private you will start really slow

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but depends on coin allocations in the 64 segments

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] ProficieNt#3097
And the idea is that someone public notarizes before you

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and what segment is the 0 segid next

[26-Jun-18 11:24 PM] ProficieNt#3097
So you can't fuck with the diff and start doing a long range attack?

[26-Jun-18 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
only with the non-notarized chain

[26-Jun-18 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
which isnt very long range

[26-Jun-18 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can fiddle with the diff a bit

[26-Jun-18 11:25 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Hmm

[26-Jun-18 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but how to stay ahead of the publci chain without half the stake and majority hashrate

[26-Jun-18 11:26 PM] ProficieNt#3097
When you submit your 10 blocks and Notarization starts, do you ahev to include the returning notarizations before your next Notarization

[26-Jun-18 11:26 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Or could you drop 50 blocks and the notary would make 5 main chain notarizations

[26-Jun-18 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you could drop 50 blocks

[26-Jun-18 11:27 PM] ProficieNt#3097
But you have to do it before someone does 1p

[26-Jun-18 11:27 PM] ProficieNt#3097
10

[26-Jun-18 11:27 PM] ProficieNt#3097
If it's 10 blocks per Notarization

[26-Jun-18 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
before anybody else notarizes after your private fork

[26-Jun-18 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
not per notary

[26-Jun-18 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
all notaryies age as a group

[26-Jun-18 11:28 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Sorry, corrected

[26-Jun-18 11:29 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay, I understand how it works. You'd need to have majority pos and pow to be able to censor. Will need to think about how successful you would even be if you had majority of both

[26-Jun-18 11:29 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Thanks for your time jl

[26-Jun-18 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i feel there are some attacks against the 64 segids, just havent come up with any yet

[26-Jun-18 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright plz document the censorship attack on 100% PoW parallel chains, attribute it to Oliver

[26-Jun-18 11:37 PM] ProficieNt#3097
I'm not convinced staking really fixes the problem if you can get majority POW and POS. Once you're in control, you cement your position. However, with POS the community could always fork out the coins of bad actors. If there is some sort of deposit delay that would let the community act, this isn't a bad solution

[26-Jun-18 11:37 PM] ProficieNt#3097
It's late so maybe I missed something but I think pos might not solve censorship

[26-Jun-18 11:37 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Will look further tomorrow, keen to be proven wrong

[26-Jun-18 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if majority control of PoS is also required that is a much bigger burden for censorship

[26-Jun-18 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I think minority stake allocated in the 64 segids can create high probability to stake a block

[26-Jun-18 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it requires active coin movements to achieve this

[26-Jun-18 11:39 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Not necessarily, as you fracture the network you fracture security. But, you don't need super meme tier TPS for a long time. If staking is expensive enough then you can wars off bad miners that way

[26-Jun-18 11:39 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c maybe I misunderstood the staking mechanism then, will go over tomorrow

[26-Jun-18 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the 64 segids merge into a single pool after 128 seconds

[26-Jun-18 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
each 2 seconds another segid becomes eligible

[26-Jun-18 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
At the risk of sounding like I'm in denial: Who's going to spend thousands of $ to make $20, on scale?

[26-Jun-18 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
10% stake parked in one segid will have a very good chance to win a block every 64

[26-Jun-18 11:41 PM] ProficieNt#3097
What does that mean Genie, what is $20

[26-Jun-18 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
this is censorship attack, not financial

[26-Jun-18 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
money is not an object

[26-Jun-18 11:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, a costly attack on principle with a known no chance of financial recovery?

[26-Jun-18 11:43 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Jl, does pos give you a chance of being the one with reduced diff for the next block?

[26-Jun-18 11:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure there's any way to completely stop that level of hate

[26-Jun-18 11:43 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Genie, it's not expensive as you think and yes there are ways to stop it

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
genie, you've attacked coins on principal before ðŸ˜‚

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
It's one thing censoring bitcoin (very expensive) and another censoring a small sidechain (relatively cheap). That said, pos may change the feasibility

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
just imagine you had more money

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes PoS gets to mine at current diff

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Genie, it's not expensive as you think "
Today, no; 6 months from now, much more so

[26-Jun-18 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
likely to be not so hard

[26-Jun-18 11:45 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Genie dude, please stop saying dumb stuff. I'm trying to learn here, we're talking about splitting into sidechains. Not Mainchain komodo

[26-Jun-18 11:45 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Each sidechain doesn't have the full network hash rate on it

[26-Jun-18 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
very little hashrate

[26-Jun-18 11:46 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay, so assuming the random can't be I fluenced by evil miners, there's a chance that the public will get a chance to mine enough blocks fast that they reach Notarization before the attacker

[26-Jun-18 11:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@ProficieNt I'm not sure how an interjection from one of the largest asset chain miners (if not *the* largest) is "dumb stuff", but I'll leave you to it ðŸ¤¦

[26-Jun-18 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
with 1000 chains in a cluster, none of them will have a very high hash rate

[26-Jun-18 11:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1/1000th of 1/2M sSols

[26-Jun-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
evil  miners can cause problems

[26-Jun-18 11:48 PM] ProficieNt#3097
The good public only needs to reach Notarization once, while the attacker needs to win every time. And if pos is simple probability, the chance that the public  eventually notarizes isn't too bad (assuming not too high delays in between notarizations)

[26-Jun-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we might have to go to 5 blocks per notarization for chains that want to be censorship resistant

[26-Jun-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
pos isnt just simple probability

[26-Jun-18 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
a massive hashrate can substitute for a massive stake

[26-Jun-18 11:49 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie I'm attacking your ideas, not your qualifications. I think it's foolish to not respect the fact that when you split a network you split the pos and the pow

[26-Jun-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
coinage = (value * diff) * ((diff >> 16) + 1);
            hashval = arith_uint256(supply * 64) * (UintToArith256(hash) / arith_uint256(coinage+1));
            if ( hashval <= bnTarget )

[26-Jun-18 11:50 PM] ProficieNt#3097
I know @jl777c but pos isn't as bad as pure pow. That said it's not a major improvement if delays between block notarizations is long

[26-Jun-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so the more coinage and more coins, the easier diff

[26-Jun-18 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
diff = (iter + blocktime - txtime - minage);
            if ( iter > 0 )
                diff += iter + segid*2;

[26-Jun-18 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to recommend notarizations every 5

[26-Jun-18 11:52 PM] ProficieNt#3097
This is why most sharding systems have a source of randomness for allocating stake. However, each of these sidechains should be more significant than a shard so you can probably get away with it

[26-Jun-18 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
this is reverse of sharding,

[26-Jun-18 11:53 PM] ProficieNt#3097
You're still cutting up network security resources?

[26-Jun-18 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
well its not that these parallel chains were ever KMD itself

[26-Jun-18 11:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I'm attacking your ideas, not your qualifications. I think it's foolish to not respect the fact that when you split a network you split the pos and the pow"
I never said it wasn't possible, I'm merely trying (in vain it seems) to point out that it's not sustainable for anyone not willing to piss away tens of thousands of dollars. Yes, it's "cheap" in the short term; however, in the long term, community hash can/will grow to combat it. This is one of the things I'm addressing in my multi-chain stratum.

[26-Jun-18 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt diluating KMD security resources

[26-Jun-18 11:56 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay but these chains need to organize their security in a way they can't be strong armed easily

[26-Jun-18 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in the world with thousands of fungible chains in a cluster, if any one of them is constantly censored, then people will use a different one

[26-Jun-18 11:56 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie if you're mining an asset chain and not getting any block rewards you're going to increase your hashrate towards it?

[26-Jun-18 11:57 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Selfish mining cuts other miners out of rewards

[26-Jun-18 11:57 PM] ProficieNt#3097
It means they're incentivized to abd on the asset chain

[26-Jun-18 11:57 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Because their being frotnrun by a bigger player

[26-Jun-18 11:58 PM] ProficieNt#3097
So the big boy is making more money than he would if he was honest

[26-Jun-18 11:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and so far we have a perpetual reorg that is needed to sustain the censorship

[26-Jun-18 11:58 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Pos obviously changes things but the point remains

[26-Jun-18 11:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"if you're mining an asset chain and not getting any block rewards you're going to increase your hashrate towards it?"
well, since asset chains are covering all of my mining overhead this month, I'm going to say that's a hard "yes"

[26-Jun-18 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
OK, I think I need to cap the PoS diff, that will neutralized the attacker's power from massive hshrate

[26-Jun-18 11:59 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Then you're not a game theoretically logical miner

[26-Jun-18 11:59 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Normal miners prioritize profit

[26-Jun-18 11:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
people underestimate the value of 0.0001 rewards

[27-Jun-18 12:00 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Genie, if you fight a big Boi, you lose and get 0

[27-Jun-18 12:00 AM] ProficieNt#3097
So people don't fight

[27-Jun-18 12:00 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Unless the pos difficulty can make it so the small bois don't get cucked

[27-Jun-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
I 10x'd the DEX hash rate and no miners left

[27-Jun-18 12:01 AM] Alright#0419
just a couple days ago

[27-Jun-18 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
what was the PoS chains diff when you were testing?

[27-Jun-18 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
I was seeing diff of 4 or so

[27-Jun-18 12:02 AM] ProficieNt#3097
Me?

[27-Jun-18 12:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
At this current time, there's quite a bit of hash that is segregated across asset chains, I'm working on a srtatum that can help us all have more even gains and stop our need to "pick one"

[27-Jun-18 12:03 AM] Alright#0419
I don't have the chains still. Wiped the VPSs recently. I have it automated if you want me to find out

[27-Jun-18 12:03 AM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c can asset chains theoretically use any consensus?

[27-Jun-18 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
for PoS

[27-Jun-18 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
I am thinking of capping the diff at 10 or so, so CPU is enough to get blocks
