@jl777c do you have an opinion too Stakenet (XSN) ???

[25-Jul-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
never heard of it

[25-Jul-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
they seem to have a lot of buzzwords, any working tech ?

[25-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Acura#2748
They want to do Atomic swaps by Lightning.

[25-Jul-19 06:58 PM] peddycb#5889
Lightning Atomic swaps

[25-Jul-19 06:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
i had some back and forth w/them Q3 2019 is the hopium

[25-Jul-19 06:58 PM] peddycb#5889
would like to hear your opinion

[25-Jul-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried that, but it isnt very efficient

[25-Jul-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i implemented subatomic swaps, where you exchange a little bit at a time via a payment channel

[25-Jul-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but you end up doing so many tx, it is slow and LN isnt exactly trustless for small payments

[25-Jul-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
building on top of LN, it seems a very risky plan

[25-Jul-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
people can barely get LN working for its intended usecase of micropayments

[25-Jul-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how they will make it work seamlessly for swaps, seems a mystery

[25-Jul-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
also what about coins without LN?

[25-Jul-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
who holds the keys during the swap?

[25-Jul-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe they use LN just for the broadcast network, which is quite an inefficient usage

[25-Jul-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr wait until they get something into beta release before believing they can get it to actually work

[25-Jul-19 07:02 PM] peddycb#5889
I just watch the project and want to learn what is good and evil

[25-Jul-19 07:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was reading about Stakenet today, hard to understand what it's based on. My understanding so far is that XSN masternodes act as full wallet for different coins, users have a light wallet. Masternodes are connected via LN, they do the order matching thing and trade between them. Users withdraw real coins when done. Seems an highly efficient proxy-token dex. I could be wrong though, details are scarce

[25-Jul-19 07:03 PM] Acura#2748
I had a chat with one guy from xsn. 
Asked him how i need xsn ?
 For which reason ?
This he answered to me:

Primary:

Payment of all fees (onchain tx, offchain tx, lightning swap fee).
Burn verification of dApps.
Payment of DB and CPU renting.

But you don't have to own xsn to do this. For example, if you want to pay a merchant with LTC who only accepts BTC LN payments, you can do this with LTC thanks to LN swaps and the swap fees are calculated in the backend with XSN and deducted over a separate LN swap without you noticing.

We migrate all LN features into our MN layer (channel funding, facotry channels, watchtowers, swap resolver, ...). Consequently, the MN operators are also those who benefit from most of the fees. On the other hand they have to run potent hardware to host the fullnodes with multiple blockchains or dapps.

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator

[25-Jul-19 07:03 PM] Acura#2748
MN = Masternode

[25-Jul-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a custodial process where all MN become money transmittors

[25-Jul-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
good luck with that

"Masternodes are connected via LN, they do the order matching thing and trade between them"

[25-Jul-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
seems they just use LN as a network. strange as it makes more sense to use the p2p network as a network

[25-Jul-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so they have LN there for the buzzword value, not technical

[25-Jul-19 07:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
found an article w more details: https://medium.com/stakenet/xsn-2018-roadmap-ccpos-part-2-548d27958ebb  yes the MN are connected via LN and act as watchtowers. No much details on how users funds are secured, my best guess it's in fact a proxy token system

[25-Jul-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe they need LN for all these fees going back and forth

[25-Jul-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds very complex

[25-Jul-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we have proven atomic swap tech that will scale to millions via decentralized nSPV system

[25-Jul-19 07:11 PM] peddycb#5889
I'm going to rest tomorrow, that's just too much for my head üòÖ

[25-Jul-19 07:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
the argument about regulation was the the mn would be anonymous so "the govt couldn't get them" üòÖ

[25-Jul-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
well then, go all in!

[25-Jul-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but actually, regulations or not, a custodial process is obsolete

what are the `b` addresses for and can anyone have a KMD address starting with `b` or is that a DEX thing?

[26-Jul-19 03:08 PM] CHMEX#0686
b addresses are multi sig addresses

[26-Jul-19 03:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
And addresses with redeem script

[26-Jul-19 03:10 PM] Oszy#5734
ah okay

[26-Jul-19 03:10 PM] Oszy#5734
thanks

[26-Jul-19 03:10 PM] PHBA2061#2530
or in a generic way, addresses that start with `b` are "Pay to script hash" addresses

so $VEIL is interested in getting added to AtomicDEX, but they are just adding ElectrumX support and are wondering if they need to get their coin upstreamed into the main ElectrumX repo or if they can operate ElectrumX servers for it if that takes a long time to happen

Hi, we are running a blockchain project and we wish to adapt Dpow technology into our chain. But we are not very familiar with the code. Who should we contact if we wish to find a 3rd support to help with the technique  integration?

@bztianjiao there are few devs to contact.
@dukeleto is most experienced implementing dPoW to 3rd party coin projects.
There's also @blackjok3r who can help with such dev work.
And I think @radix42 too

"Looking for confirmation on the 98% figure. And is that 98% of KMD swept was returned or 98% of KMD reclaim forms were processed?" @jl777c   asking for a friend

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont have exact figures, but it can be tallied from the blockchain. I have put in about 750,000 KMD and all but 30k have been refunded.

[07-Aug-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
approx numbers are 7M swept, 7.75 million refunded, total stolen is 7.8? mil but not 100% knowable

[07-Aug-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
total claims left are about 30,000 but from 261 addresses, so an average of 115KMD

[07-Aug-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
was a very costly lesson

[08-Aug-19 08:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c i read something recently about some devs adding a vault, whereby the BTC is sent to a special address. Then once a tx is created to use that utxo, the owner has x amount of time to VETO a tx basically. Dont know how it is supposed to work but would something like that work with KMD?

yes

requires constant monitoring, special GUI

[08-Aug-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
seems not a big project

[08-Aug-19 08:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you know how they can stop someone with your private keys from spending it with a higher fee?

[08-Aug-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is a bit like atomic swap, some clever scripting to allow vaulting

[08-Aug-19 08:42 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
months ago I talked with @mrlynch about developing a CC for a bounty from me, based on the original Vault paper by prof. Sirer, but it's still far from completed

[08-Aug-19 08:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will be interesting to learn how this is done

[08-Aug-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
Under Bishop‚Äôs proposal, if an ‚Äúunlock period‚Äù were initiated, an owner could choose to react or not react.

[08-Aug-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is like atomic swap timeout, with yourself

[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But if someone has your private key, how does the blockchain know who is the owner? üòõ

[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you send funds to a p2sh address that requires an unlock utxo that is matured

[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is another special utxo that needs to be spent first, the spending of this starts the unlock period

[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So maybe they are thinking about it the wrong way, the default should be not to send and if you are sending a valid tx then you send that through

[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i think ALL spends need to go through this, so if a one day delay, then all access to these funds will take a day

[08-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
in the event you see the unlocking txid activated, you have one day to spend (with a different privkey?) the original funds, which are still in the conditional p2sh

[08-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
something like that

[08-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can find the design document that he posted wherever, i can look at it and see how hard it is to do

[08-Aug-19 08:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[08-Aug-19 08:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
there are 2 keys involved from my understanding

[08-Aug-19 08:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But now thinking about what you wrote, i wonder if it is much easier just to get say 3 yubikeys and setup a multisig address somehow

[08-Aug-19 08:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
