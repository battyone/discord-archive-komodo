it is close enough

[08-Jul-19 04:40 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
whast missing or wrong

[08-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization process is free running

[08-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
there isnt any overall 2 two-fold process

[08-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it just ends up that way due to the way the blockchains work

[08-Jul-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
all tx in a block, encode in its blockhash

[08-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization tx are tx, so they are too

[08-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so there are notarization process for all the notarized chains

[08-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
including KMD->BTC

[08-Jul-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
each notarization happens about every 10 minutes, but there is no strict guarantee, also blocktimes for blockchains can vary a lot

[08-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a clockwork synchronized process between all the notarizations

[08-Jul-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each notarization is INDEPENDENT

[08-Jul-19 04:43 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok cool

[08-Jul-19 04:53 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Komodo has Nakamoto consensus correct?

[08-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
as its primary consensus, yes

[08-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
however it is modified two ways

[08-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
notary nodes get to mine at easy diff (CPU) once per 65 blocks

[08-Jul-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and it uses longest notarized chain logic, instead of just the longest chain logic

[08-Jul-19 05:01 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
cool

[08-Jul-19 05:03 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
so for un-notarised blocks (part of chain which still needs to be notarized ) it still uses longest chain rule?

[08-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that allows the normal consensus to determine the blocks

[08-Jul-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarization is not making changes to the normal consensus process. it just wants to observe and notarize

[08-Jul-19 05:50 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
BTW this itself is an awesome value proposition, which should to market as different product itself ..may building more offering in future around 3rd party blockchain security

[08-Jul-19 05:51 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I suggest creating an ad in https://www.crypto51.app/ or similar sites ..and reach out to projects directly and offer komodo's dPoW.. (This means don't wait if they will come.. Komodo should go to them with this value proposition)

[08-Jul-19 06:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
Pirate is erroneously listed on that site, it's dPoW protected

[08-Jul-19 06:32 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
another reason to contact them

[09-Jul-19 03:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap the dev of that site is either not around anymore or doesnt really care. Numerours PR and email have been sent.

which fortune 500 is it? amazon huawei ...

[09-Jul-19 05:00 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
Maybe binance

Any fortune 500 companies or big names are testing Antara or interested in it already?
Yes, there is interest from very big companies. We can't disclose more at this point.

Or is there a better way to see and use the BarterDEX?

[09-Jul-19 07:56 PM] dan.#2473
that used to be for mm1

[09-Jul-19 08:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
got it reading the dev-marketmaker channel and readme linked

[09-Jul-19 08:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Don't think that works @daemonfox

[09-Jul-19 08:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I know @CHMEX was going to try to get mm2.0 orderbooks on his site.

[09-Jul-19 08:32 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Ok..let me paint a different picture of Komodo vision 

Komodo is now focusing on attracting users to build blockchain on top of Komodo blockchain.. This value proposition needs lot of resource and community development..
Ethereum is already way ahead in Dapp market and Cosmos and polkadot's offering is better in terms of "build your own blockchain" in comparison to Komodo (Don't want to offend anyone,  this is my research) 

So let's forget about Dapp market.. and think of "Build your own blockchain" usecase.. Both cosmos and Polkadot are building frameworks so others can build a blockchain using their framework but real business model is "security as a service" even for Polkadot and cosmos.. Cosmos hub plans to provide security as a service in the future and for polkadot you need to deposit dots to secure a parachain (blockchain build on polkadot).. Both these protocols deploy some version of PoS.

Now Let's talk about Komodo.. Komodo can champion "Security as a service" for PoW blockchains ...or even further this development and become a general purpose  with decentralise  "security-as-a-service" usecase. Now comes the cream,. Go with this same value position to enterprise which are using hyperledger or any other consortium blockchain (may be extra privacy feature)..   

I think this is a better and niche usecase, and also good for KMD token economics.

[09-Jul-19 08:51 PM] allbits#5898
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap have you ever built your own blockchain?

[09-Jul-19 08:55 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes I tried on komodo as well as cosmos

[09-Jul-19 09:21 PM] kostak11#7773
hey @jl777c . Does the exchange need any type of licenses to operate?

[09-Jul-19 09:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap you have not tried chainlizard ðŸ˜›

[09-Jul-19 09:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just wait for that

[09-Jul-19 09:37 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
this is similar to "create your own token" GUI

[09-Jul-19 09:40 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I think in the case of blockchain .."less to good" principal works.. People need to do real work in terms of building tech on blockchain.. what will 'X' do after launching the blockchain?  There were tons of ICO raised funds and did nothing.. with your own blockchain you need to do lot of work.. + I believe there are not many use cases out there..

[09-Jul-19 09:41 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Simple question - Does is make sense "Everyone building a blockchain"?

[09-Jul-19 09:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
It never made sense when everyone wanted a .com ... it never made sense when everyone wanted a mobile app... it never made sense when every one wanted a coin ...and it will not make sense when every will want to build a blockchain

[09-Jul-19 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The first step is to draw them in, do you think any of the ERC20 tokens would run their own infrastructure? This is a way to get them to migrate over. This will also drum up marketing and hopefully showcase our tech to the industry.

[09-Jul-19 09:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once they are on, who will not pay a few hundred a year for dPoW? This goes to your security as a service

[09-Jul-19 09:51 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Rather going this way and building komodo's own infra..why not direct build on "security as a service" infra.. why you need people to build blockchain on top of komodo..to provide security as a service?

[09-Jul-19 09:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then once they are on board with dPoW, they will use the DEX and many other services within the Komodo ecosystem

[09-Jul-19 09:52 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am a "security-as-a-service" minimalist in this argument

[09-Jul-19 09:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I do not understand, when people launch a chain, they launch nodes all via a GUI. If they want dPoW they pay for it. The chain is a asset chain not on top of Komodo

[09-Jul-19 09:53 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Why they do this? when Ethereum ICO can be done without paying anything

[09-Jul-19 09:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ERC20s are a token beholden to its master and the taxes (gas fees) they charge. They also do not have bitcoin level security

[09-Jul-19 09:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think you need to look into the value proposition that Komodo asset chains offer first.

[09-Jul-19 09:55 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I think Ethereum has enough security on main chain

[09-Jul-19 09:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then we can have this discussion

[09-Jul-19 09:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Believe me, I went through all over komodo's doc

[09-Jul-19 09:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How do you get around the tax they charge for being on top of ETH? Tomorrow they can make each tx cost $10, who would use it at that point

[09-Jul-19 09:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
We are missing a point here.. EOS has better transaction rate... what about that?

[09-Jul-19 09:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What if ETH shuts down tomorrow

[09-Jul-19 09:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ðŸ˜„

[09-Jul-19 09:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
EOS has better transaction rate because everything you do is a tx

[09-Jul-19 09:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Same tax applies there too, but add on top computational ram BS too

[09-Jul-19 09:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
wait ..lets not divert from the discussion

[09-Jul-19 09:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
These are the things you are missing which is critical to the value Komodo adds

[09-Jul-19 09:59 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
My point is rather going through -> build blockchain on komodo -> use dPoW (security as a service) ...why not directly focus on security as a service

[09-Jul-19 09:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We have a few 3rd party chains that use dPoW.

[09-Jul-19 09:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So launch chain then dpow is a option, not the only option

[09-Jul-19 09:59 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes.. lets grow them and focus on that

[09-Jul-19 10:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a chicken and egg problem

[09-Jul-19 10:00 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
get 3rd party chain on Komodo to use dPoW

[09-Jul-19 10:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You need people to know about what KMD offers before they would want dpow

[09-Jul-19 10:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen, you need users that tell their coin communities about dpow and komodo

[09-Jul-19 10:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen we need  this mythical thing called marketing

[09-Jul-19 10:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen you need something to market

[09-Jul-19 10:01 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
no.. i don't think so.. this way your target  get niche and you just need to reach project..who already understand  blockchain tech and might face the security problem

[09-Jul-19 10:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen, we need to build things that will get reported on and is useful and showcases our tech

[09-Jul-19 10:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think we need to agree to disagree.

[09-Jul-19 10:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The more you refine what you do, the more you dig yourself into a hole. It is better to offer many different things to many people than to offer a single thing to a small amount of people.

[09-Jul-19 10:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to capture users, who will then capture more and more who will then bring in leads to partnerships and other things.

[09-Jul-19 10:03 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```The more you refine what you do, the more you dig yourself into a hole. It is better to offer many different things to many people than to offer a single thing to a small amount of people.````
This is completely wrong Bitcoin is an example .. Whatsapp is an example

[09-Jul-19 10:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We do not have the first mover advantage

[09-Jul-19 10:04 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
simple clear value proposition is always better

[09-Jul-19 10:04 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
do 1 thing..and do it best

[09-Jul-19 10:04 PM] phm87#7395
You can launch your own blockchain (independant of KMD blockchain) easily and using komodo binary (then you use the consensus algo and all features developed by jl777 and KMD community). You can decide POW, POS or both, txfee and which special rules (cc). Any dev can easily launch his blockchain to test features.
dPoW is a paid service to have bitcoin security level using a network of 64 Notary Nodes
Among the many features, there is a DEX (MM2) that is open under beta testing.
Komodo coin itself is the central currency of the ecosystem

[09-Jul-19 10:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes i agree, but the market for dpow is very small now, why focus on something that has a tiny market vs something with a big and wide market?

[09-Jul-19 10:05 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"market for dpow is very small now" let's rethink this

[09-Jul-19 10:05 PM] phm87#7395
the "do one thing and do it better" is the huge experience of jl777 and his team allowing them to develop and test rapidly. Opensource mindset helps

[09-Jul-19 10:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Now is the key word, dpow is not going away

[09-Jul-19 10:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So whilst the focus is to get users and people using Komodo tech, who says we cannot cater to the crowd that wants security as a service

[09-Jul-19 10:07 PM] phm87#7395
many coins were 51% (ETC also for 400 blocks) ... here is a website with potential victims : https://www.crypto51.app/ (ARRR should not be on this website because it is dpowed)

[09-Jul-19 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
One other thing to remember, is that when coins are in trouble, they will approach the team. This is not something you plan ahead for most of the times....

[09-Jul-19 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But for them to approach the team they need to know about them

[09-Jul-19 10:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
and the best way to do that is via the users telling them
