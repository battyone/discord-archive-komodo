I'm reading it, but it's without exact command examples

[29-Aug-18 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember you gave the example command to make exact BTC mining assetchain

[29-Aug-18 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm thinking to make an experiment chain which is z tx only

[29-Aug-18 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
want it to be exactly as BTC

[29-Aug-18 12:59 PM] jorian#4555
bitcoin behavior would be -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=210000
KMD behavior would be -ac_reward = 300000000 -ac_end=7777777

[29-Aug-18 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_reward= 5000000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_private=1 `

[29-Aug-18 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
had this thought for a moment, but I coiuldn't think of usecase

[29-Aug-18 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
gateway like other chains do the CC contracts but end up on a z tx only chain ü§î

[29-Aug-18 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
since we have the capability to do cross blockchain contracts

[29-Aug-18 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but missing pieces here are z tx enabled CC

[29-Aug-18 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least an example hasn't been written as I know

[29-Aug-18 01:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm.... yeah thought again... üòÑ won't happen

[29-Aug-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
meaning each coin in the HIDDEN chain is 1:1 convertible to some external coin

[29-Aug-18 01:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes James, something like that

[29-Aug-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with sapling activated such assetchain we can have it hopefully on mobile too

[29-Aug-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so a z tx only chain for a mobile wallet! üòé

[29-Aug-18 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but need to figure out the usecase üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there would need to be a MGW type of system

[29-Aug-18 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like BTC this HIDDEN Chain having :
total supply of 21,000,000 coins,
halving every 2 years/210,000 blocks,
block mining time of about 10 minutes,
starting with 0 pre-mine, so all can mine it,
z tx only chain, no public tx other than mined utxos.

[29-Aug-18 01:08 PM] jorian#4555
i don't think it's 10 minutes

[29-Aug-18 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
while we'll have this, we can think of it's usecase while playing with it

[29-Aug-18 01:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in LN the LN happen offline, and settle on BTC chain.
I think of assetchains, as like whatever tx happens there and kinda somehow settle on this HIDDEN Chain....
just a raw thought... ü§î

[29-Aug-18 01:11 PM] jorian#4555
i'm mining it üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 01:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian bravo! üëè

[29-Aug-18 01:12 PM] jorian#4555
but i need an ip

[29-Aug-18 01:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I used HIDDEN as I read it also like HID DEN .... DEN to hide üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 01:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a Komodo's DEN to hide.... üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 01:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian I yet to reset my hetzner, can use that soon for IP

[29-Aug-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt need to match all of BTC aspects, just as long as 1:1 is ensured

[29-Aug-18 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
right....

[29-Aug-18 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so what will it be then... a smart 1:1 only chain ü§î

[29-Aug-18 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a burn protocol chain

[29-Aug-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like it having 0 or lil more than 0 coins initially,
but if other chain send it's tx to it, it creates those and if sends back those are burned

[29-Aug-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like that? ü§î

[29-Aug-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I know no contracts.... but then how will it be 1:1 ?

[29-Aug-18 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for me identity and reputation. these two are fascinating in blockchain tech

[29-Aug-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to see it solved on komodo tech

[29-Aug-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or an implementation of it

[29-Aug-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
verus is doing things around it

@jorian server setup, installing komodod

[29-Aug-18 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
ok, just post the params + addnode here when done

[29-Aug-18 02:23 PM] jusoaresf#3291
this sound like music to my ears

[29-Aug-18 02:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian give me the command to start the chain

[29-Aug-18 02:46 PM] jorian#4555
can you try `./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=500000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &`

[29-Aug-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need to divide the supply and blockreward by 10, because the blocktimes are 1mins not 10min

[29-Aug-18 02:47 PM] jorian#4555
there is no initial supply

[29-Aug-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
halving and blockreward then is it?

[29-Aug-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
either way the amount of coins per block

[29-Aug-18 02:47 PM] jorian#4555
isn't it times 10 then?

[29-Aug-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its reward divide by ten and halving x 10

[29-Aug-18 02:48 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[29-Aug-18 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so the same command or you changing ?

[29-Aug-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want same as BTC you need to times halving by 10 and divide block reward by 10

[29-Aug-18 02:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &`

[29-Aug-18 02:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
50 * 100,000,000 = 5000000000
21,000,000 / 10 = 2100000

[29-Aug-18 02:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian you have to start fresh, as reward is adding 1 more 0

[29-Aug-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC blocks per hour = 6. KMD AC blocks per hour = 60

[29-Aug-18 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
hmm

[29-Aug-18 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r not clear what you saying

[29-Aug-18 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need change in tht command?

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
4 year halving is 2,100,000 blocks not 210,000 blocks

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what are you trying to do?

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jorian#4555
bitcoin style mining, but in minutes instead of 10 minutes

[29-Aug-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
mimicing BTC coin emission doesnt seem to make much sense

[29-Aug-18 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c plz suggest a z tx only assetchain params

[29-Aug-18 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will start that

[29-Aug-18 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a playground

[29-Aug-18 02:55 PM] jorian#4555
a KMD style is fine too, right

[29-Aug-18 02:55 PM] jorian#4555
without any premine

[29-Aug-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i think just having enough block reward so there are miners, not much else matters for testing purpose

[29-Aug-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
at first it would need to be a trusted manual gateway that handles redeems and such, but if the mining reward is big, it will be diluting any external peg

[29-Aug-18 02:57 PM] jorian#4555
how about we call it MOLE

[29-Aug-18 02:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
why not PIRATE then :trollface:

[29-Aug-18 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
haha

[29-Aug-18 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
PIRATE it is

[29-Aug-18 02:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ooh... cool

[29-Aug-18 02:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay PIRATE

[29-Aug-18 02:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
plz make as James says, I'll execute that on my server

[29-Aug-18 03:39 PM] jorian#4555
haven't tried this before, but how about `./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225` as a test?

[29-Aug-18 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
256 block reward that halves every 77777 blocks

[29-Aug-18 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
we can always hardfork üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 03:54 PM] jorian#4555
ok it's on

[29-Aug-18 03:54 PM] jorian#4555
anyone can mine this now

[29-Aug-18 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810

z_sendtoaddress doesn't exist?

[29-Aug-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
z_sendmany

[29-Aug-18 04:06 PM] jorian#4555
z_sendmany finished (status=failed, error=Change 254.9999 not allowed. When protecting coinbase funds, the wallet does not allow any change as there is currently no way to specify a change address in z_sendmany.)

[29-Aug-18 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
so for others: send 256 only

[29-Aug-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
do exact amounts

[29-Aug-18 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
yes, makes sense

[29-Aug-18 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
good error message

[29-Aug-18 04:13 PM] jorian#4555
256 isn't allowed either, you have to subtract 0.0001 for the fee. so 255.9999 works

[29-Aug-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Z_sheildcoinbase will do it automatically

[29-Aug-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Much easier, just call it on cron

[29-Aug-18 04:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
To a single z address
