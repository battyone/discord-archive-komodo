so other than its you, its lucky 7s, I'm thinking luck isn't invovled in anything you do

From recent reviews it seems that the AtomicDex is fantastic. really Great job!
I haven't tried it yet a but I also haven't seen a screenshot of AtomicDEX that contains 
an optional reporting service as in CEX's (deposit, transactions/trade history, withdrawals), I hope it has this option.
If it doesn’t, I'm afraid that I won't be using it and have the feeling that many others would do the same,
because for some of us that go the legal route when we make a withdrawal to fiat  
and need to prove the source of our funds to government, IRS and banks it's going to be a nightmare.

do you have a 777 tattoo on your arm?

[17-Jul-19 08:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@artik123 it will come eventually

[17-Jul-19 08:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
it's already a nightmare. if you sell a car on craigslist do you report that income? does craigslist generate .csv reports for you?

[17-Jul-19 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I cant remember but i think my app had a export history option

[17-Jul-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see why you cant get a list of historical trades

[17-Jul-19 08:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@actionslacks yes you do, if you made a profit

[17-Jul-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
not right now, as it isnt the main priority

ok

[17-Jul-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then you have capital gains tax.......whatever, let's take it to trading.

[17-Jul-19 08:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it capital gains when you most probably realized a loss on the car?

[17-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not many people sell their cars for more than they bought it after using it

[17-Jul-19 08:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Cryptoon  personal use property not subject to capital gains or losses ( here in the us at least )

[18-Jul-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
crypto coins are not personal property?

what? you have to pay on gains, but dont get to claim losses??

[18-Jul-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if any business did that, they would lose all their customers

[18-Jul-19 06:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
irs is a business with a captured clientele. you can try to claim a lot of things, but it's a crapshoot.

SuperNET is not like the komodo project with activity non-stop

[18-Jul-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it is more just a holding fund with occasional revshares given out as it gets them

[18-Jul-19 12:29 PM] bishop#9773
In the US, you can claim capital losses on crypto. You're just limited to offsetting your capital gains or if you have done that/have no gains, then $3000 with a carry-forward into future tax years. It got real messy for filers when they booked profits in the December 2017 run up just to roll  back into btc or alts and then subsequently booked losses in 2018/2019.

[18-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Neko#5830
Will komodo keep updating to the newest Zcash parameters

[18-Jul-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810

if just a single one of them isnt colluding with all the others, there is nothing to worry about

[18-Jul-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
100% of all participants need to be colluding for there to be any issue

[18-Jul-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
while it isnt fully trustless, from a reality based practical standpoint, 100+ is more than many coin networks and the chances of all of them in collusion is really nothing to lose sleep over

[18-Jul-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the odds of a software bug is much higher than collusion of all participants

[18-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Neko#5830
yes it is

yes

[19-Jul-19 07:58 AM] criptobear#6402
Would it be possible to adopt a name system in Komodo ecosystem? Like eos to be clear where the wallet address is a word chosen by the user

[19-Jul-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
dilithium CC has name support since long ago

[19-Jul-19 11:25 AM] criptobear#6402
I was reading the dilithium page but isn't it about new assets? Can be implemented in KMD wallet?@jl777c

[19-Jul-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
to implement it into KMD would require non-consensus changing wallet usage similar to dilithium, so possible certainly

[20-Jul-19 08:17 AM] zatJUM#9924
I'm not a dev (so I can't find if there's relevant code for this).
I'm running komodod on a "ipv6 only" vps (just copied komodod there as github isn't reachable through ipv6).
For it to run, I had to modify in ~/.komodo/komodo.conf from `rpcbind=127.0.0.1` to `rpcbind=::1`.
Now it seems to sync (`du -hs ~/.komodo` is growing).
I can't check this with `komodo-cli`: ```komodo-cli getinfo
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)```
It seems `127.0.0.1` is hardcoded somewhere in komodo-cli.
Can you confirm?

[20-Jul-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
seems possible

[20-Jul-19 09:41 AM] zatJUM#9924
Well, it is. I've found a way to use anyway: `komodo-cli -rpcconnect=::1 getinfo`

[20-Jul-19 09:41 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks

[20-Jul-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@zatJUM 127.0.0.1 bind doesn't hardcoded (I wonder), I've binded to 0.0.0.0 lets say with needed IP allowed for remote RPC calls

[20-Jul-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Used `rpcbind=0.0.0.0 + rpcallowip=rpcclientip` Not sure about ipv6

[20-Jul-19 11:06 AM] Small Fish#5687
@jl777c what is your take on quantum computers? Specially what kind of cryptography do you think can protect DLT from this threat?                    The day where true quantum computer are in the wild seem closer and closer.

[20-Jul-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
dilithium is a QC resistant signature method and we already have an antara module for it

[20-Jul-19 11:15 AM] Small Fish#5687
I didn’t know dilithium that’s interesting. but in case of quantum computers Komodo’s notarization on bitcoin chain would be then useless ?

[20-Jul-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
so would world banks lol

[20-Jul-19 11:18 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I recommend you to read this article first, to understand what kind of threats QC could cause to Bitcoin <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Quantum_computing_and_Bitcoin>

[20-Jul-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
actually the notarization would be fine as its existence is its proof. granted the QC could be spending the fees, but likely they would go after much bigger addresses first

[20-Jul-19 11:29 AM] Small Fish#5687
Ok i see so we are pretty safe 😃

[20-Jul-19 11:29 AM] Small Fish#5687
Thank!

[20-Jul-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
by the time the big BTC addresses are being QC attacked, we need to be in the process of converting to dilithium or equivalent

[20-Jul-19 03:48 PM] Small Fish#5687
And an other question how will you deal with atomicDEX if it becomes too big and attract US regulatory administrations? I know it’s decentralized and all but that can impede company adoption that would be reluctant to use a tech that don’t have the US administration favors. And also kmd could be forbidden to be traded on centralized exchange

[20-Jul-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
why would they single out KMD? using that logic, since atomicDEX is coin agnostice, all coins would need to be forbidden to be traded

[20-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the USSA is actually not the entire world

[20-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can get a few percent of the non-USSA trading volume, that isnt such a bad scenario

[20-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, how will they stop it?

[20-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jul-19 03:55 PM] Small Fish#5687
Because the dex come from kmd ecosystem.  USA is still a power that we can’t disregard specially for industrial adoption. Anyway dex will comes in many shapes and they need will to adapt. I was just wondering

[20-Jul-19 04:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Small Fish  according to their Fincen’s latest guidance on CVC it seems Atomicdex will be in the clear for now. https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf

[20-Jul-19 04:02 PM] Small Fish#5687
I will take a look thank!

[20-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a special exemption for non-custodial atomicDEX

[20-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so they would need backtrack on that and prosecute their own voters

[20-Jul-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
in anycase, atomicDEX is the most resistant to regulations of all the systems out there and if atomicDEX is stopped that means crypto is dead
