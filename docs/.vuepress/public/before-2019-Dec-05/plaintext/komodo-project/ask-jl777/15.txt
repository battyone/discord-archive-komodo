I'd instead would like to use/try SPV + CC + WASM in web browser.

What is the reason utxo based smart contracts haven‚Äôt been thought or done by others in industry and what made kmd‚Äôs implementation different as comparison to others?

[20-Aug-18 04:35 AM] Mylo#8306
CC layer allows for smart-UTXO.  bind them to previous transactions (e.g. at creation time) and other types of relationships is my guess.  all on-chain.  so where you may have had two tx in the past and been able to make an app that behaves in a similar way, there was no blockchain binding - only an app that could mimic a what-if-we-could-bind-these-transactions-together-with-some-rules.  we now have these rules (conditions) on chain, instead of some random app developer.

[20-Aug-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
currently the CC contracts are done at the source level

[20-Aug-18 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is linked in and part of the komodod codebase

[20-Aug-18 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
now, it would be possible to make some sort of dynamic linked library to include external code

[20-Aug-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this library would have the identical code functions as the current CC contracts. look at faucet.cpp it is 100 lines and not very complex at all

[20-Aug-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so whatever language that can create compiled code that can be linked into komodod, those are the languages that can be used. I wouldnt recommend interpreted language

[20-Aug-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and the model now is to make a CC contract that can spawn new instances of it via rpc calls. and to limit any repetitive actions and rather be transaction invoked to get runtime. So for assets CC, you do a tx that locks coins/assets into a special address and the other party spends that tx to complete the trade

[20-Aug-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
let us not get too abstract

[20-Aug-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
let us stick to specific questions on how to do some specific thing.

[20-Aug-18 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
I think that will then make it much clearer how it all works

[20-Aug-18 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
start by reading faucet.cpp, then rewards.cpp, then dice.cpp and assets.cpp if you are ready for that level of complexity

[20-Aug-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
probably we need someone to make onboarding doc to allow a new dev to come up to speed, however it will require knowing how utxo work. so if we can find pre-existing docs about utxo, a new dev can start with that

[20-Aug-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
once you understand utxo, then it will become much clearer. if you dont, it will just be confusing

when VRSC does a pull request for verushash, there will be the second one and after that adding new hashalgo will be much simplified

[21-Aug-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are talking about multiple algos at the same time... that is open to more attacks as there are multiple diffs to manage. We do have mixed PoW/PoS that can be any percentage from 1% to 100% PoS

[21-Aug-18 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm a noob to ETH smart contracts.
Would you say making smart contract on utxo based smart contracts would be easier for developers as compare to making smart contracts on balance based blockchain ?

[21-Aug-18 10:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I understand a little, ETH because of not being utxo based looks to be easier. But once a developer gets familiar with the concepts of like
how to make a address
how to generate a raw transaction
how to manage tx inputs/outputs 
that should make them feel easier with crypto conditions ?

[21-Aug-18 10:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is my assumption correct ?

[21-Aug-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it will likely always be easier on a balance based system

[21-Aug-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
however with my multipay CC, I will create a balance based system on top of utxo

[21-Aug-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo will be harder to deal with, but much much much safer

[21-Aug-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
with a balance based system, entire balance is always at risk to a bug

[21-Aug-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
with utxo system, only the specific vout funds are at play

cool, thanks for clearing James. üôÇ üëç

[21-Aug-18 11:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what will be the purpose of multipay CC? What will it solve ?

[22-Aug-18 08:16 AM] demols#8610
Could crypto conditions be used for derivative contracts like bitmex so there can be a decentralised bitmex  ?

[22-Aug-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically, yes

[22-Aug-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
after the next round of CC contracts are in place it will become much easier. the only issue is that it needs to be a "cash settled" contract and the "cash" would be the coin for the chain the CC runs on. so it would need to run on a chain with actual value and liquidity

[22-Aug-18 09:56 AM] demols#8610
And can barterdex or hyperdex be used to trade contracts ?

[22-Aug-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you mean about trading contracts

[22-Aug-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean transferring an existing position to another party?

[22-Aug-18 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that would be possible if it was implemented, but it seems simpler just to create the same position?

[22-Aug-18 10:31 AM] demols#8610
Iff i have a long position someone else does have a short position if i want out of the trade i sell my long position to someone else

[22-Aug-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is cash settled,so you can just cashout via the blockchain without needing to find someone to buy your position

[22-Aug-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
that is assuming we can get a blockchain enforced cash settled system working.

[22-Aug-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you can cashout without anybody else, why not do that?

Hi James, I'm trying to set up ms wallets on komodo using addresses from multiple wallets. I bump into problems when signing ("error": "Operation not valid with the current stack size"). probably I am missing a step in the process?

what is an ms wallet?

[22-Aug-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess he means `multisig wallet`

[22-Aug-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a bit tricky to do as rawtransactions are needed, but there is insufficient details to have any meaningful answer

[22-Aug-18 11:28 AM] barv#0867

In ETH devs can code and push smart contracts on Blockchain.
In KMD so far the code is written and pushed to the Komodo source code adding additional RPC calls. 
Do we expect new model for third party devs which won‚Äôt require code acceptance PR to Komodo git source, or it will remain same?

[23-Aug-18 02:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or it will be like VerusCoin, to fork Komodo source code and code smart contract in the forked code?

[23-Aug-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
once the foundational CC contracts are there, most normal dapps can be done via rpc calls to them

[23-Aug-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
which means normal app devs can make dapps

[23-Aug-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
long term automatic dividends will be the goal, but it wont be for a while as it isnt quite ready for consensus level revshares. however I could see doing a dice dealer type of realtime dividend. or maybe on-demand where you can request a dividend if it is over a threshold amount, for now I am concentrating on the most powerful set of foundational CC contracts so rpc calls can do as much dapps as possible

Once the multigateway CC is done, along with the prices CC and a special CC for this, then trades could be cash settled in BTC  or KMD or the onchain coin. it will be some months away as I am still at the design stages for the foundational CC contracts. however the scope of these contracts is quite limited and I did get the first four contracts coded in a week, debugged in another week and so far in testing there are no reproducible bugs. All in a one month span

A: assembly language vs higher level language with functionality enhancements, ie. not comparable

[24-Aug-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
A: using wasm type of approach, JS can be made into a compiled blob, getting it to play nice with the komodod executable will likely require some tricks. And this is core code, so maybe it is best to stay with an actually compiled language

no

[24-Aug-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810

if somebody creates the cryptokitties chain on a assetchain he/she would need to create the kitties DNA in CC which would run on it's own compiled komodod (kittiesd) daemon is that correct?

@CHMEX yes, but with qualifiers. see the next answer

[24-Aug-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
The spanning set of rpc contracts possible to be created is based on the rpc extensions the foundational CC contracts have

[24-Aug-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there is a DNA CC that allows to specify via OPRETURN data the DNA characteristics, then it could well be possible to make a cryptokitties dapp via rpc calls + data

How to write utxo based CryptoConditions contracts for KMD chains
by jl777

This is not the only smart contracts methodology that is possible to build on top of OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION, just the first one. All the credit for getting OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION working in the Komodo codebase goes to @libscott. I am just hooking into the code that he made and tried to make it just a little easier to make new contracts.

There is probably some fancy marketing name to use, but for now, I will just call it "CC contract" for short, knowing that it is not 100% technically accurate as the CryptoConditions aspect is not really the main attribute. However, the KMD contracts were built to make the CryptoConditions codebase that was integrated into it to be more accessible.

[24-Aug-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
Since CC contracts run native C/C++ code, it is turing complete and that means that any contract that is possible to do on any other platform will be possible to create via CC contract.

utxo based contracts are a bit harder to start writing than for balance based contracts. However, they are much more secure as they leverage the existing bitcoin utxo system. That makes it much harder to have bugs that issue a zillion new coins from a bug, since all the CC contract operations needs to also obey the existing bitcoin utxo protocol.

This document will be heavily example based so it will utilize many of the existing reference CC contracts. After understanding this document, you should be in a good position to start creating either a new CC contract to be integrated into komodod or to make rpc based dapps directly.
