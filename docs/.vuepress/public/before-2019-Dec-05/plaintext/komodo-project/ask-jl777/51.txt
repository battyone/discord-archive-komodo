no problem mate... 🙂

@josephnicholas GMT+8 grewal's document is much more detailed and I highly recommend that. Also, this document is more focused on how to add dpow to specific external coins, might answer some questions for you: https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md

Yeah I already that document @dukeleto Thanks for that also. So just a prelim question, so SuperNET is still handling the NN, until now

[15-Feb-19 02:22 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
?

[15-Feb-19 02:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
SuperNET repo has the code which compiles to a binary called `iguana`, this code has the Notary Node management code.

[15-Feb-19 02:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The Notary Nodes need `iguana` to do Notarisation operations for all the blockchains being notarisied.

[15-Feb-19 02:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
I like to think of iguana as the glue between various coins/blockchains that notaries use to send blockhash data from coins with smaller hashrates to coins with larger hashrates

[15-Feb-19 02:25 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So its like without iguana, KMD can't achieve dPOW

[15-Feb-19 02:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
DPoW is an abstract protocol. It could be coded in any language and any program. The name of the program that implements the current dpow implementation is iguana. Full nodes also need to know/do various things to interact with iguana, but usually not much

[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is like the code for dPoW is not in 1 single place, It's like modulating I guess....
Better management of code and daemons being separate etc.

[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Notarisation code = `iguana`

[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
I defer to James on these things, but hopefully I can help answer some questions that he dutifully answers endlessly 🤠

[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] ChinMullet#6245
how can i tell if my address is private or transparent?
i have my KMD on Ledger Live

[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Notary Node blockchain enforcement rules in blockchain  = Komodo daemon or any other dPoW adopting blockchain daemon

[15-Feb-19 02:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
starts with R = transparent, starts with z = private @ChinMullet

[15-Feb-19 02:30 AM] ChinMullet#6245
ok, thanks

[15-Feb-19 02:30 AM] ChinMullet#6245
all i see is recieved from and it starts with an R

[15-Feb-19 02:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Chin Mullet #deleted-channel is probably better for those questions

[15-Feb-19 02:31 AM] ChinMullet#6245
ok, ill ask there

[15-Feb-19 02:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 the code that enforces dpow is in each full node of each coin. The code that *creates* notarization data, which takes 13 notaries to come together and agree, is called iguana

[15-Feb-19 02:43 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @dukeleto and @grewalsatinder I will ask questions when I finish reading the medium page

[15-Feb-19 02:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no problem mate... 👍  🙂

[15-Feb-19 02:55 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, @grewalsatinder just want quick question again, so the document also says about how does KMD/3rd party blockchain is able to get BTC hash rate right?

[15-Feb-19 03:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The same KMD to BTC explanation applies to 3rd party blockchain to KMD

[15-Feb-19 03:21 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@grewalsatinder so the notarization process has the defense for 51% attack? Since once notarization ends the block height is already irreversible and the blocks already is not possible for reorg right?

[15-Feb-19 03:23 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I just don't understand the statement people say about "dPoW enables KMD or 3rd party chains to share same Hash rate with BTC"

[15-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once a checkpoint is created by a notarization then the chain cannot reorg back past that block height on all nodes that validated it. You can run the other chains daemon (in KMD case BTC) when the chain loads on start or syncs from scratch it will check the txids on BTC to verify that they match. 
This proves that the notarized checkpoint was valid at that time, and as BTC cannot be reorged to remove these transactions that contain KMD's blockhashes it gains the secuirty of BTC by default.

[15-Feb-19 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hope that makes sense.

[15-Feb-19 03:38 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Totally makes sense, wow thanks @blackjok3r !!!
>`it will check the txids on BTC to verify that they match. ` so how does the KMD daemon find the txid in BTC if there is no running BTC daemon or like `iguana`?

[15-Feb-19 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It will only check them on nodes where BTC is running ie./.. notary nodes.... So because all notary nodes are runmning BTC they know 100% they are notarizing the correct chain. 
All other nodes trust that the checkpoint created is valid and true. They also have the option to run a full BTC node and validate them self if they choose to do so.

[15-Feb-19 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Iguana is seperate again, all we use that for is the communication between notary nodes. It decides randomly which nodes create the notarization.  and builds the transaction that is sent to KMD and BTC.

[15-Feb-19 03:44 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh, so KMD nodes, connects to Notary nodes  for verification, then  Notary nodes are running BTC nodes.

[15-Feb-19 03:44 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Notary nodes are nun in `komodod` right?

[15-Feb-19 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes. Notary node runs a full node of komodo and BTC. They check and verify every notarization.

[15-Feb-19 03:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So there is switch in `komodod` to run full node and not.. Okay that makes sense. That's why I notice when I run `komodod` it doesn't download the whole chain

[15-Feb-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each komodod node checks the notarization  is valid in its own chain, but if BTC is running it will automatically contact the BTC daemon to verify the notarisations on BTC.

[15-Feb-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
komodod will be running a full komodo chain, but it canot verify the data on BTC unless its got access to a BTC node... All notary nodes do this, so if you are syncing from them, then you can be sure the chain is valid with BTC notarizations as well as notarization on komodo side only.

[15-Feb-19 03:51 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks for this great information, so to sum it all up, KMD is 51% attack proof since snapshots of KMD hash are stored in the BTC blockchain, KMD is reorg proof since once the attacker executes the 51% attack the created block hashes should correspond on the notarized block hash in the BTC blockchain.

[15-Feb-19 03:52 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Correct me if I'm wrong

[15-Feb-19 04:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that is correct

[15-Feb-19 04:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@josephnicholas GMT+8 I see you got confused and it's sorted out in later comments.... 
I think you still haven't completed your read on that article, it all covers these steps, you are asking...

>Oh, so KMD nodes, connects to Notary nodes for verification, then Notary nodes are running BTC nodes.

No. No `komodod` client node need to connect to the Notary Nodes. They only need to connect with the peers, like any other bitcoin based blockchain does.
Each node verifies the validity of the transaction in a satoshi consens way that it's not a double spend with the base Proof of Work or Proof of Stake or any Proof of X algo that blockchain is using.

There are 2 transactions which are related to 1 notarisation, in a quick short exaplantion:
1. The tx which holds the latest block hash of the blockchain. Example: KMD block hash, added to the OP RETURN data in the BTC transaction.
2. As soon as this BTC transaction is created and broadcasted, and iti's availble in the mempool, this BTC tx is taken and added to the OP_RETURN data of a KMD transaction.

Once this notarisation KMD tx is validated by the miners, it is ireversible by the dPoW consens rules coded in the KMD daemon.
All network client KMD nodes follows these rules.

Since this KMD Tx is mined and validated by all the client peers that it is not a double spent, it is valid.
And since this KMD tx holds the notarisation data in it's OP_RETURN, it is valid notarization tx.

[15-Feb-19 04:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is all covered in that dPoW explained article.

[15-Feb-19 04:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Please tell me you have finished that article read.

[15-Feb-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there are things about dPoW taht are not in any articles 😉 I have come to learn this in the last week while trying to make notarypay mechanisim for #kmdlabs

[15-Feb-19 04:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its just not as simple as its has been explained.

[15-Feb-19 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There can be a notarization that exists on a node that is running, but when you freshly sync it that notarization can no longer be there.

[15-Feb-19 04:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd like to update those there if I understand what's missing 🙂

[15-Feb-19 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The notarisation is valid... but its not even in the blockchain... I understand this is nessary for it to function... But it was totally unexpected to find this.

[15-Feb-19 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because a checkpoint is created in a tx that itself has not been checkpointed by a future notarization It is possible that some nodes can have notarizations that other nodes do not have. its is very rare for this to occur, but it indeed can happen.

[15-Feb-19 04:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure concequences of this... or if it could cause a fork or not. Until i tried to use notarization checkpoints as consensus rules... you cannot do this... It will fork the chain. 😂

combining privacy and anything else... just seems a bad idea as it is so hard to obtain the real privacy in the first place. Why not to use privacy coin for privacy and if other things are needed to convert to other coins that can achieve that without relying on bold claims, high cost, new breakthoughs which are "only 6 months away"
