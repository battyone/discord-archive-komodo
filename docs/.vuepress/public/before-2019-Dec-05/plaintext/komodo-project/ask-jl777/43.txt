I do what I can to improve things in each area, along with strategic investments

[02-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Dave123#3592
I invested and follow a lot of crypto projects but somehow I completely lost track of the SuperNET/Komodo developments. I think other projects do a better job in updating people and putting out the information what they are working on.

[02-Jan-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if enough large SUPERNET holders come forward with request to liquidate, i will honor that

[02-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Dave123#3592
Ok thanks for answering the questions.

[02-Jan-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo developments are in the dozens of channels here

[02-Jan-19 02:21 PM] sφldat#8733
do you claim the 5.1% rewards with SUPERNET address?

[02-Jan-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no reward claim directly in SuperNET. only Komodo has it

[02-Jan-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
SuperNET rewards gets airdropped

[02-Jan-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a bit more time with the pre-1 million utxo

[02-Jan-19 02:27 PM] crumb#2550
i think he meant if KMD rewards get claimed

[02-Jan-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i certainly will be doing the monthly claims

[02-Jan-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
@Dave123 how much SUPERNET do you want to sell?

[02-Jan-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are buyers

[02-Jan-19 02:29 PM] Dave123#3592
@ komodo developments are in the dozens of channels here
Thats the problem. Making an update once in a while about direction of development an progress would save you a lot of time by not answering questions to people like myself

[02-Jan-19 02:30 PM] Dave123#3592
Not going to sell the bottom. 😃

[02-Jan-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can get someone to do the summaries that you describe. i am not against it

[02-Jan-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
dont everybody volunteer at once!

[02-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Acura#2748
@Dave123 if you follow the 5 Bulletin Weekly Newsletter from Komodo, you are updated every week about the progress

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Dave123#3592
@Acura I do read the newsletter. I was asking about an general update for Supernet investors.

[02-Jan-19 05:10 PM] crumb#2550
@Dave123  why do insist on concentrating on supernet? vast majority of updates regarding komodo tech also mean that "supernet stuff" is being improved.

[02-Jan-19 05:13 PM] crumb#2550
yes, it is possible to do better communication, but if you already have done your homework to invest in supernet then you understand that entails mainly concentrating on komodo ecosystem

When is KMD halving?

[03-Jan-19 09:14 AM] Mylo#8306
it doesn't.   maybe at block in maybe 10 years.  block 7,777,777 it reduces.   we are at block 1,111,111 approximately

[03-Jan-19 09:14 AM] Mylo#8306
1,167,861

[03-Jan-19 03:29 PM] dan.#2473
Supernet has always been interesting to me, i was also in at ICO. but i opted out and parked myself in komodo instead when mm1.0 was at its peak. the 5 percent reward and (in my opinion) gains will be larger with kmd itself. and, the illiquidity was worrisome. if there was a CC way for supernet to auto-buy and auto-sell holdings on bdex like an ETF, it could trade near NAV and be fully liquid. Though, as KMD is the base to get Supernet, there's a myriad of problems with this, such as being able to auto-buy-sell WAVES or auto-buy-sell illiquid holdings like some assetchains.

[03-Jan-19 03:36 PM] dan.#2473
if this could be solved, Supernet could exist indefinitely and people who want the NAV can get it

[03-Jan-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how that would work without slippage and a large amount

[04-Jan-19 01:35 AM] richardt#2807
I don't think it's a good idea to liquidate SN at this point or anytime soon.  But, it might be a good idea to have a little summary of how fees collected have been flowing and maybe a forecast of when to expect the next dividend payout.

[04-Jan-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX is the main revenue engine other than dPoW fees. There are explorer addresses that show the dPoW fees. I just need to find some time to summarize things. short answer is we are a long ways to go before next revshare due to 80% correction of bear

`As some people have noticed, Veriblock is one of the implementations that is responsible for the steep rise of OP_RETURN outputs recently. VeriBlock utilises the BTC blockchain to store proofs.`
`VBK currently accounts for roughly 19% of all Bitcoin mainnet transactions. `

what is the percentage for Komodo's dPoW?

note that, doing less transaction and still getting equal security as btc is a positive point.

maybe only counting OP_return? Even that seems huge

There are some important tidbits on this article beyond the headline:
1- $VBK *testnet* is responsible for ~19% of ALL $BTC on-chain txs🍿
2- $VBK PoP is far more permissionless than $KMD dPoW https://t.co/guHcky1kdP

@Maat once your funds are migrated to sapling, you should be able to use your current computer. sprout txs are CPU hungry and requires a lot of time and power to process them. your funds are being migrated now.

I think if it pays the fee it's not spam, however @VeriBlock made about 1 million bitcoin tx with op_return from the 1st of December 2018, they call Proof of Proof but is it more Proof of Spam? Why more than one tx per block? https://t.co/As40AAr57E

[05-Jan-19 07:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
1 million tx since 1st december? this seems crazy to me

[05-Jan-19 07:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think they are full of it.  1 million BTC tx , with low fee of .0001  is 100 BTC .

[05-Jan-19 07:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So some perspective they spent more in a month than we do in about a year

[05-Jan-19 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright yes, it's bad, that means less space for LN to save BTC

[05-Jan-19 09:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, dPoW is efficient in spending BTC, not spammy, and still secures the chains with btc hash power. Good to know. 😅 👍

[05-Jan-19 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright yes mate, I was also thinking the same about bragging

[05-Jan-19 11:59 PM] Mylo#8306

I dont know if you feel like answering to this kind of questions but here it comes. What are your thoughts regarding Greg Wright and his claims to be satoshi? He seems smart but very aggressive on his talks and especially on twitter account.  I just really cant rule out of that possibility.... Has anyone else done research on him? If you ask why and who cares.  Well it is that he has said to be destroying btc with his million coins. @jl777c

[08-Jan-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
he does not seem to be technically knowledgable enough to be satoshi

[08-Jan-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
seems after the police raid of him, he is acting against the interests of crypto

[08-Jan-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
his rhetoric during the SV fork was quite silly

[08-Jan-19 02:12 PM] Mark81#4505
Why is he pushing so hard to just get laughs?

[08-Jan-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it overlooked that the moment ABC chain mined an incompatible block, there was no hash war, since there are two chains. one chain having more hash has no effect on the other. having no replay protection made doing tx risky. so the entire hash war was fake

[08-Jan-19 02:15 PM] Mark81#4505
Nobody with enough right mind would do that and to me he is either insane or really what he vlaims yo be. In his talks on youtube he speaks actually in away that he believes those things actually happened to him. 🤔

is there any chance a compromised (50%+ attack) block makes it into the BTC Chain via the dPoW mechanism, if the attack is not recognized within the 10 minute timeframe?

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
what does that even mean?

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
a block is valid or invalid

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is invalid, it isnt valid

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is valid, it is valid

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
only valid blocks are notarized

[08-Jan-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in other words, notarizations allows to differentiate between two valid blocks

[08-Jan-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to differentiate invalid blocks as invalid blocks are not valid

[08-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
so any manipulated blocks cannot pass the validation process and be notarized into the BTC blockchain?

[08-Jan-19 05:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
block validation is a work of miners
