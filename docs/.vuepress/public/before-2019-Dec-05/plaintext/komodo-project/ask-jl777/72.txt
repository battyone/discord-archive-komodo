bye

[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] Coin2stable#1872
you are such an acolyte, that why jl777 runs a multimillion dollar project and not you

[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
when you have some question be back.

Almost multibillion ecosystem actually

[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
only at the last bull market peak

[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, this bull market, should go above several billion if combining entire ecosystem, not that i can take such credit for all projects

[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
at least i did start the ball rolling

[21-Jun-19 08:28 PM] phm87#7395
@Coin2stable  I am not an investor but I'd be happy to buy your DEX shares ^^ I wrote DEX stuff in my proposal and this tech is really needed for futuristic crazy cool things

[21-Jun-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
he probably has 20 DEX

@phm87 if you don't want to use Barterlly, you can just ask in trading channel.

[21-Jun-19 08:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for sure you'll find some buyers and sellers there

[21-Jun-19 08:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c don't know if has or not, but sure was absolute uninformed person.

[21-Jun-19 08:31 PM] phm87#7395
I'd like to have 100$ worth of DEX but I have no clues of prices

[21-Jun-19 08:31 PM] phm87#7395
(I'll change of channel)

@phm87   I am holding them to see what happens if it works , great if it doesn't I lose a little, I have no qualm in doing what I do , it gives me insight, I have a-lot more than 20 DEX but that is besides the point the amount it should not matter all investors have right they place  their hard earned money big or small , I will always respect all my investors large or small so I expect this

[21-Jun-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be nice if you gave me some respect

[21-Jun-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i do honor my commitments, and for DEX that is the revshare

[21-Jun-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
1 DEX or 100000 DEX, it is the same

[21-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but even if you had 100000 DEX, i wont be changing my policy of not disclosing trades that are in the process. telegraphing your trades is not wise

[21-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there wont be annual reports, fancy meetings, quaterly reports, tradeshows, offices, etc.

[21-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
just a pure revshare entity

[21-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
everything is on the blockchain, so there is a public report every minute with every new block

[21-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if investors want more detailed reports, i dont stop them from making them

[21-Jun-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if non-investors want more detailed reports, i dont stop them from making them

[21-Jun-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i never committed to making nice fancy investory relations

[21-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As everything is on the blockchain, all movements are public anyway

[21-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i believe i did help many who believed in me to become millionaires, or at least pretty well off

[21-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
will DEX achieve giant success? i cant predict with certainity

[21-Jun-19 08:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have seen people making SuperNET reports in early days

[21-Jun-19 08:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is community effort

[21-Jun-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
all the regulations do seem to be lining up to boost the DEX

[21-Jun-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i took care of getting the tech done, created enough of the ecosystem so it can grow to where it is now with the help of the hundreds of others

[21-Jun-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
now really, my only task left is to just process the revshares for DEX

[21-Jun-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not even on the mm2 team, my mm1 provided the "spec" for them to perfect it with atomicDEX

[21-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so i feel i met my obligations and will just process whatever revshares accumulate

[21-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
anything else will need to be done by others

[21-Jun-19 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, and since mm2 is total redesign and being built with different prorgramming stack, like Rust, and not C, James can actually give guidance and not code, since he's Simple C coder

[21-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is unacceptable, then there are plenty of buyers who are ok with this non-corporate setup

[21-Jun-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the work done inside corporations seems to be having meetings about the meetings to decide what meetings to have, and filling out the TPS forms

[21-Jun-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i just made DEX to be the pure flow of revenues from swap to the payout to hodlers

[21-Jun-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing more, nothing less

[21-Jun-19 08:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
where with mm1 it was mostly only James, now with mm2 there's a team of devs, better diversified load of developers is better than most load on 1 dev.

[21-Jun-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, and it can continue to improve and iterate, without me

[21-Jun-19 08:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[21-Jun-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i do of course have the occasional suggestion

[21-Jun-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i had one the other week, that will solve the scaling problem

[21-Jun-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and the z-atomic swap

[21-Jun-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so i keep improving the overall tech and will monitor and manage the revshare

[21-Jun-19 08:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but i dont expect there to be any meaningful DEX revshares until next year

[21-Jun-19 08:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to me it's more exciting that the new mm2 team solved some good amount of core issues making it much more solid learning from the past experience from James

[21-Jun-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take time to ramp up usage, especially as it is all actual volumes and no fake volumes at all, the exchange volumes are very misleading

[21-Jun-19 08:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the percentage of successful swaps is amazing in even mobile DEX

[21-Jun-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 solved the client <-> client comms issue

[21-Jun-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
on mobile too

[21-Jun-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i just used nanomsg and it doesnt punch through the NAT, which made it not work with a lot of clients

[21-Jun-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
has nothing to do with atomic swaps or crypto, but a lot to do with usability

[21-Jun-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
not having to worry about any of that, allowed me to do the CC

[21-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Ok   and  in regards to "i believe i did help many who believed in me to become millionaires, or at least pretty well off"   I believe  you can do that again and  make a-lots of your team, investors  and your wives  (Jets/yachts etc) very happy , if you really make a DEX work in terms of revs as that will mean being able to earn or cash out your revs anywhere in the world,

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Switzerland , hongkong, singerpore etc

[21-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
ok let see

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i just want a smoothly working atomic swap DEX that has liquidity

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the entire industry (world) needs this haven from regulations

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] willofleo#7505
few asset can do that , that why I think DEX  is a billion pound token

[21-Jun-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever revenues this becomes over the years, it will be what it will be and i will distribute it

[21-Jun-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
after i am gone, at worst it is one set of dividends that are lost, if there isnt another person with the privkey. currently it is only me

[21-Jun-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
when revenues start getting bigger, i will get the privkey to others

[21-Jun-19 08:59 PM] willofleo#7505

[21-Jun-19 08:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess by that time comes there will be some kind of automated solutions to it. If not fully then at least some level of semi-automated to make sure all such operations run as expected

jl wont play that on us , I do hope his wife does not divorce him though

[21-Jun-19 09:01 PM] willofleo#7505
will that mean they split the ownership 50- 50

all the DEX, SUPERNET, etc. are not my property, they belong to whoever has the coins, proportionally

[21-Jun-19 09:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what are you thoughts on making a DAO CC for such dividends which doesn't require human interaction at all?

[21-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[21-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
add CC to BTC?

[21-Jun-19 09:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or you think human interaction even if it's semi-auto is mandatory?

[21-Jun-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
add CC to all the ERC20?

[21-Jun-19 09:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not exactly ü§î

[21-Jun-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i will write automation, like the hack refund processor

[21-Jun-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so it will be automated, but a dapp that i run locally

[21-Jun-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so ultimately , it could just be running all the time

[21-Jun-19 09:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, so that in you non-presence if the responsibilities are moved to multiple parties they don't mess things up

[21-Jun-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but first i need to write the automation

[21-Jun-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
need to have moar dexfees so i can test it

[21-Jun-19 09:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[21-Jun-19 09:10 PM] allbits#5898
I've always thought it would be a great achievement in human history to have a DAO control a BTC address that is not controllable by any other person. Possible?

[21-Jun-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
homomorphic crypto signing

[21-Jun-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
still a ways from having a practical way to do this. maybe if i had help from a cryptographer to do the deep math, then i can solve the practical issues
