ok thank you, so could you be a developer that we could work with? @jl777c

[03-Sep-18 10:28 AM] paddycy t.me/totemtribe#4865
otherwise ill reach out to chainmakers and chainzilla. 
(thank you so much for your time and help)

@jl777c So i can make a masternode based asset chain on komodo?

[03-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
lets say a i wanted to create an asset chain that people can buy and lock up in their wallet to get payouts. is this option available in the komodo ecosystem ?

[03-Sep-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the rewards CC. there is documentation for it somewhere

Somewhat of a rhetorical question: Why do you think the media (and many in the crypto community) pay no attention to the power of Bitcoin's security coupled with storing a hash of something important and verifiable in OP_RETURN. 2nd Question: Any idea if KMD's Dpow is the largest external business process using OP_RETURN?

I dont think anybody paid the media to write about such things, so they dont

@jl777 Hmmm, I have trouble believing it's that close. I don't think we will get there in our lifetime, it's possible tho. What are your reasons for believing we are so close? @Deleted User I feel like we should all choose to live forever just by looking at game theory. We are not sure what happens after death. We can somewhat guess that there will be eternal life due to technology tho. It seems more likely than an afterlife. My guess is this, we will live forever and be the masters of our own individual realities. We will then get "bored" of being god and having control so we "die" by giving up everything we had (infinite power) and going into a decentralized reality. One where there is a consensus on the rules and you don't have full control. Is it possible that we are part of a human/computer- conciousness blockchain of sorts?

Every cell and atom of the body has an existence beyond the cessation of the beat of the heart, biochemically the processes of disintegration actually accelerates metabolic activity in the body after death. Each one of these individual units atoms, cells and molecules goes on beyond the dissolution of the corpse to be re embodied as another creature or another form of life, why would not the higher psychological entity that inhabited the body not continue on to live once more, the more ethereal a being the more eternal, the more material the being the more finite.

@jl777c are you familiar with the book called "a new kind of science"  by steven wolfram. talks about ideas such as communicating by in time.  it has apparently already been done for a small instance , less than 2 seconds. it is the intersection of computer science and chemistry.   what ae your thoughts on this and could this lead to a breakthrough in our life expectancy outcomes.?

@jl777c i was testing rpc libs last week - for the architecture of dapps.
currently
```
[webpage]<------->[local OR remote proxy server]<------->[KMD RPC]
works
```
however
```
[local webpage]<------>[local KMD daemon] 
does not
```
and the reason is web browser has CORS error when talking to local daemon directly.

`geth` (ethereum client) has a command line argument --rpccorsdomain [1]

Would it be possible to add a similar setting in komodod.conf so  komodod will allow web browsers to connect to kmd rpc directly.

It's the CORS pre-flight check which needs support [2].  Browsers automatically send these HTTP OPTIONS requests, which rely on the server side to respond with the cross-origin "access-control-allow-origin" and "access-control-allow-methods" and "access-control-max-age".  Otherwise current dapp architecture i think would be limited to proxy-requests either by sending requests through to an intermediary on the same host as the daemon (could be same machine, but just adds the "backend" to connect to from a web application).

Lots of Info about CORS here [3] in case you're not familiar.

tl;dr; üëÜ cannot hit KMD RPC directly from browser without CORS pre-flight check responses.

[05-Sep-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
isnt there some proxy you can use for the local webpage?

i am not familiar with CORS, actually familiar with CORS problems that are hard to solve

[05-Sep-18 09:24 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, that is the first architecture, using a proxy.   just means unable to write apps directly from the browser for now.

[06-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c Working on documentation, trying to clarify things.

The following is the current text. It's an example for the `getaddressbalance` method.
```
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```
This general idea is repeated throughout the documentation.

Is this for executing on a remote server? Or are there circumstances where I would execute this locally?

[06-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is this a leftover from the Zcash documentation?

[06-Sep-18 01:39 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, is there a limit to how many addresses can be requested in `getaddressbalance`?

[06-Sep-18 04:48 AM] gcharang#6833
```
> komodo-cli getaddressbalance '{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}'
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```
both are equivalent. But `./komodo-cli` is easier to use while a person is accessing the node through a terminal or using shell scripts.
The curl command can be used both locally or remotely(with the appropriate settings and permissions). The rpc interface is mainly for writing other programs(ex:wallets that need GUI) that access komodod

[06-Sep-18 05:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, interesting. I'm about to go to bed. Will need to pick this up again tomorrow.

[06-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang If you want to just scroll through real quick, you can see what I'm working towards. Trying to take into account guidance from @Mylo, too.

Would it be possible to run the marketmaker on mobile phones (with the current marketmaker). And/or would it be possible to have a simplified version of the marketmaker, that works on mobile?

I know that mm 2.0 is in development. Though I would say that most of mm 1 could be running on mobile devices already - There aren't many difficult libraries that it's dependent on?

Assuming the answer is yes, that governments will utilize blockchain tech someday in some way, do you foresee government entities emulating KMD (or using KMD) and notarizing to BTC for accountability to citizens/validity purposes or more likely going to roll their own solutions not connected to any existing public blockchain.
