@grewalsatinder I tend to consider myself to be very tech savvy and honestly the common everyday user is never going to move to linux. It requires you to problem solve independently way more than windows and most people aren't going to be able to do that. That's a big thing people forget paid services and software tend to have a alot of support behind them for help whereas open source won't due to that help not being funded.

[09-Jan-19 11:39 PM] SHossain#0007
all it requires is curiousity, determination and how to search on google to be honest üòÉ

@jl777c I know you must be sick of this question as it has been mentioned not only here but on forums/tweets talking about Komodo, but I see people talking about dPoW being "centralized". As you said once, Komodo's tech has too much for any "elevator pitch", but: What would be a simpler and more friendly way to explain that dPoW isn't centralized and something that people can trust?

[10-Jan-19 03:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
dPoW Notary Nodes are not primarily miners.
NN are like any other regular network nodes in any blockchain network.
They don't have the powers to easy mine a blockchain, except KMD.
They can not invalidate a block or reject a block since not being a miner.
Like any other regular network node, NN just accept or rejects the block based on verifying the validity of the block by checking it's local full blockchain data, against the data shared with the network peers.
NN has only 1 main power:
- Participate in Notarizing the block they get from network.
- Or don't participate.
That's the most weakest power they have, intentionally.

@jl777c I am having a little bit of trouble with the `swapstatus` command. Why do some of the  swaps only show `requestid`, `quoteid`, and `status` (`status` is always "realtime"). I know it has something to do with `LP_numskips` and `LP_skipstatus` but do not know what those are. Code I am referencing is here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blame/dbfb3dbd50346d3ee87cfddfdd9343c965d12dc8/iguana/exchanges/LP_remember.c#L1728

Just finished reading the Reddit exchange with Taek from three weeks ago. Amazing how someone with his proven intelligence and integrity can so hugely misjudge your character.  There's so much "drive by" analysis in crypto, and in the world in general. He seems to have pieced together a story based on just a couple of poor assumptions, and a whole lot of lack of information on publicly available information.

Warning: if Taek is doing this with respect to jl777, we're probably all guilty of it somewhere, sometimes.

@jl777c I know they use linux but it's obviously a modded version of the kernel is it not? Plus it doesn't really run .deb files and only apks from the playstore.

[11-Jan-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810

I was refered her through reddit to share my idea : https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/afszyk/so_why_not_ask_the_community_to_pitch_hardware/

If you don't trust links, the text is this : 

So why not ask the community to pitch hardware through a network?

I've heard kmd can do wonders as long as they have the processing power to do so, and that this is what prevents you guys from showing off a little (like with the 1 million tx/s test). As a kmd hodler I was wonder if you could create a network that all of us can contribute cpu and let the chain(s) show off a little. Would do wonders to have people talking about how many tx/s you did with the help of the loyal community. Maybe I'm missing something, but no-ones talking about kmd speed (my friends don't even know anything about you).

Any thoughts on this?

@jspook16 we hare holding a migration stress test on #kmdlabs ... IMO this test is more important than the scale test I originally started on, while that test just brute forced full blocks on 8192 blockchains at once this test is community run and focuses on sending coin's from one chain to another only.

j cooper¬Æ (bearmanpig)üè¥:
Anyone wanna comment on this I saw on Reddit?
When NEO or other chains talk about scaling to *n* TPS, they mean *n* TPS being processed by that one decentralized chain.

Komodo has very little native scalability, it instead adds a lot of different chains together, with a shared state being created every few minutes. 

E.g, On their scaling presentation, they noted achieving 20k transactions per second with 1024 blockchains. That means each blockchain has a limit of a little under 20 transactions per second. *n* for Komodo is 20, it's just 20x*1024. 

Say NEO hits 100k TPS, then starts 1023 copies. That's 102,400,000 TPS. Apparently. Would those copies be adequately decentralized? Probably not. 

So, it's a neat way around the scalability problem and a good thought experiment, but Komodo's asset chains don't scale and lack of decentralization (and in my eyes, that means lacking any value because I can have a faster and less complicated private server using AWS).


Is this a valid point?

[16-Jan-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
first it is off by an order of magnitude, each chain can do about 200 tx/sec
second, last time I checked, a decentralized blockchain was decentralized
third and most importantly, what sense is it to have ALL transactions on a single blockchain? that means all users need to sync all other users data to run a full validation node.

[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
we solve the scalability issue without requiring anybody to have TB of data and GB/sec bandwidth. surely having a practical solution is much much more important than having everything centralized in a single chain

[16-Jan-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I flip it back and say that any single chain that tries to handle all transactions will fail due to all the transactions, so clearly things need to be parallelized. I just designed it so it starts parallel, stays parallel and people just need to sync the chain they care about

[16-Jan-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
already in the ecosystem there are almost 50 chains. this is an ecosystem capacity of 10,000 tx/sec, yet people only have to run the chain they care about. So the scaling is already happening and it works so well, nobody even realized. remember the runtime forks are all running the identical executable as KMD itself. it isnt that big of a stretch to claim the combined tx/sec for all the chains

[16-Jan-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
using cross chain proofs allows many chains to have a single total supply if they are in a cluster. migrations between chains being automatic and without a counterparty.

[16-Jan-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you can do N times as many tx/sec, automatically transfer coins between chains without anybody else involved, then aside from the inconvenience of this crosschain transfer we have indeed achieved the combined tx/sec

[16-Jan-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the crazy thing is that projects like ETH are combining all the tx into a single chain and then wanting to split it out into smaller portions (sharding) and this is somehow ok? but a solution that starts out as independent chains and stays as independent chains that can do cross chain, that is not?

[16-Jan-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe can be less if you have virtual memory

[16-Jan-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810

[16-Jan-19 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
From my experience If you're not going to build daemon from source code - it's possible to run the daemon on even very low specs (just need big swap). I've succesfully ran the nodes on  very tinny AWS instances (like a 1/2 core). But it might take very much time to build on such machine
