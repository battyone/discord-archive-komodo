great job!

[29-Apr-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
still only halfway done to catchup with existing stuff

[29-Apr-19 07:03 PM] artik123#2884
the more I read the more I think many smart people in eos and ethereum are going in the wrong direction

[29-Apr-19 07:03 PM] artik123#2884
I think that they will fall on the face

[29-Apr-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
they are too smart and trying to solve a much too difficult problem

[29-Apr-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
EOS isnt a blockchain, so it doesnt really count

[29-Apr-19 07:05 PM] artik123#2884
was searching here in discord for the term "eos" and saw the article that yo u have shared.... one said that it isn't a blockchain and at the end of the article other said that it is....

[29-Apr-19 07:05 PM] artik123#2884
hehe

[29-Apr-19 07:06 PM] artik123#2884
not sure if they re doing cryptographic validations...

[29-Apr-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
with 21 nodes having 100% total control, it is more a distributed system

[29-Apr-19 07:09 PM] artik123#2884
yes, but I don't think that end user cares about that...

[29-Apr-19 07:10 PM] artik123#2884
anyway both ethereum and eos are going to be very expensive to use... don't think that their model works...

[29-Apr-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
ends users care about costs and fully decentralized would be the lowest cost, it will take some years to get the user facing GUI to hide the blockchain details, but now the consensus issues are solved, it is just a matter of doing the GUI

[29-Apr-19 07:16 PM] artik123#2884
what do you think about fees? is there a possibility to get rid of that? komodo is using miners so I guess it won't go off... eventually I think that users don't wish to pay fees for a transaction, and for businesses it can make some inconvenience with accounting

[29-Apr-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
faucets can be funded to pay for fees

@jl777c  I have a question. lets say someone has a killer app. 
why would he want to use Tezos, for example, when he can fork it?
and another question, how is he benefiting from spawning a new Komodo asset chain instead of forking Tezos?

[30-Apr-19 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
World's best 51% security is only with spawning own chain and dPoW it with. No other blockchain gives that level of assurance...

[30-Apr-19 02:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) proof of concepts,  application may not need all the functionality and cost of a forked chain. 2)   Multiple functionalities that would have be added in or adapted into the forked chain that can be added in very easily with assetchain generation( cryptoconditions ) , also lower overhead for getting a secure blockchain up,  DPoW gives the 51% protection , notaries have run nodes which increase decentralization.  Also many products essential to getting a coin off the ground are already built around rapid assetchain addition  like the multicoin wallet or atomic swaps.   Starting a assetchain would put you months ahead in work completed compared to a freshly forked chain

[30-Apr-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea about tezos, but yes this is open source and why indeed would anybody build on an expensive blockchain and subject to paying that coin as fees forever? with komodo chains they get the best of both worlds, instant jump start to development, unique ability to create a custom consensus baked into the blockchain, and have total control over their coin/project. There is no KMD tax. Asking how KMD benefits without any direct taxation, is like asking how countries with low to no tax end up with a disproportionate amount of business

[30-Apr-19 06:16 AM] artik123#2884
@grewalsatinder I specifically chose a PoS project. 
Lets say average joe doesn't have a clue about crypto attack vectors, he only cares about the cost and he trusts the killer app guy that has a the beginning 100% of the stake. 
later on, as the app succeed, app guy holding goes down to lets say 30% (which make it safer for everybody). 
People, even in the cryptoworld, already trust PoS systems (with the possibility of 51% attack) with billions of dollars so it's not an issue anymore.

[30-Apr-19 06:16 AM] artik123#2884
@polycryptoblog forking a coin costs him nothing, PoS nodes also cost almost nothing, he could also fork almost everything he wishes (such as other smart contracts that he needs, explorer etc.) 
from a mature ecosystem functionalities, as I replied to grewal it will get more decentralized with time.

[30-Apr-19 06:17 AM] artik123#2884
@jl777c It was just an example for a PoS project. thats why I mentioned forking... it's almost costless, he has an instant jump to copy everything he needs from the original project ecosystem for his own project and 
also have full control over his project (and no congestions on the blockchain) and low fees. he gets the benefits of a mature ecosystem and no taxations.

[30-Apr-19 06:17 AM] artik123#2884
I must go now, will be back in a couple of hours

[30-Apr-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and an existing project can be cloned, sure, but what is the value in that? if you are making a new custom consensus level change, it makes a new blockchain never existed before and has a unique value add

[30-Apr-19 11:24 AM] artik123#2884
maybe I misused terms. not sure if I understand your reply. 
he clones his chosen popular PoS blockchain project that suites his needs, now he has a fresh new blockchain and as a starting point he gives himself 100% of the coins in the genesis block.
the added value he gets from spawning a new komodo chain with custom consensus level changes is a small in 
comparison to the added value he gets from all the coding around mature ecosystem.

[30-Apr-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
really?

[30-Apr-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if you say so. but in general a pure clone have very little value

[30-Apr-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so yes, you can make a pure clone as anybody else can and have something without much value

[30-Apr-19 11:27 AM] artik123#2884
true, the clone doesn't have a value, but his killer app has a all the value

[30-Apr-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case it wont matter what his starting point is

[30-Apr-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is how much work is it to make such a killer app

[30-Apr-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i claim that by making a new CC, you can create a killer app and have it embedded in a dedicated chain

[30-Apr-19 11:29 AM] artik123#2884
his killer app could be a small smart contract  for example lottery

[30-Apr-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
which issues native coins that are unique

[30-Apr-19 11:29 AM] artik123#2884
it's exactly what I mean.... now he has a dedicated chain for his killer app

[30-Apr-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
a lotter smart contract on top of a cloned infrastructure will have large value?

[30-Apr-19 11:30 AM] artik123#2884
yes, why not?

[30-Apr-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if you want to make up fantasy scenarios, you are welcome to

[30-Apr-19 11:31 AM] artik123#2884
all he needs is good marketing... and small development

[30-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
a dapp running on a cloned infrastructure you claim will have more value that a dedicated chain with the dapp logic as part of the chain consensus

[30-Apr-19 11:32 AM] artik123#2884
what is the difference for end user?

[30-Apr-19 11:33 AM] artik123#2884
end user doesn't care about that

[30-Apr-19 11:33 AM] artik123#2884
amazon is also centralized

[30-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@artik123 if centralization doesnt matter, just make a website, dont worry about blockchain

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ (2) 

[30-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you think that replicating the entire infrastructure for an existing coin is just as easy as making a runtime fork with a dynamic CC, then go for it

[30-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you have the frame of mind that with one magic want you can replicate the entire infrastructure of an ecosystem and solve any and all issues that will inevetably happen, it seems we disagree. it is a lot of work, but if you also believe that users wont care about centralization, then all this is moot

[30-Apr-19 11:38 AM] artik123#2884
maybe I'm missing something. with a decentralized app he could have the lowest margins for himself, even if he controls 100% of the coins at the beginning

[30-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
how can 0 be lower than 0?

[30-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
with a komodo chain, all the margins are for the magical dapp creator as there is no KMD tax

[30-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so the question is if it really is 0 cost to clone some platform

[30-Apr-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
chainlizard allows to spawn a customized new chain in minutes and is part of how komodo is designed

[30-Apr-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
likely other chains are not designed to be so easily forked and maybe it ends up being a bit more difficult than copy/paste. then what do you do?

[30-Apr-19 11:41 AM] artik123#2884
"but if you also believe that users wont care about centralization, then all this is moot" - we already said that the user most care about the cost not centralization

[30-Apr-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
cost will be the same using komodo or a cloned system (assuming there is zero cost to clone it)

[30-Apr-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is 0 cost to clone tezos, can you make one for 1 KMD?

[30-Apr-19 11:44 AM] artik123#2884
he doesn't need to clone the whole infrastructure... just the blockchain and other specific things that he needs for his project.
others raised multi million ICO and developed projects, and he only needs to use their code for the things he needs to his advantage.
they will keep developing and he will keep update his software from their code base

[30-Apr-19 11:47 AM] artik123#2884
"likely other chains are not designed to be so easily forked and maybe it ends up being a bit more difficult than copy/paste. then what do you do?" - bitcoin already has at the moment blockchain generators... others will probably have it also... entry level will probably go down

[30-Apr-19 12:04 PM] artik123#2884
If someone wants to have a PoW blockchain I can see why he should use komodo (security), but if he wants PoS, I don't don't see a reason 
to use komodo nor the original multimillion mature PoS blockchain project when someone develops a tweakable zero cost blockchain generators of them.

[30-Apr-19 12:39 PM] artik123#2884
"So, your point was?" - read again the thread... why would he choose komodo, 
which is primary PoW system over an original PoS project ecosystem that raised $1b with hundreds or even thousands of developers, which he can choose and use their code? - it doesn't make sense

[30-Apr-19 12:43 PM] artik123#2884
don't know what exactly the problem of komodo but an easy working gui for all products and good marketing could help alot

[30-Apr-19 12:46 PM] artik123#2884
ok, if you say

[30-Apr-19 12:47 PM] artik123#2884

[30-Apr-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be as easy as using existing CC rpc calls

[30-Apr-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but likely you need to do a bit of work to create the next amazon

@Deleted User I don't mean to offend in any way.... just to question some stuff

[30-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to make a proper assessment, you need to at least read what komodo can do

[30-Apr-19 12:54 PM] artik123#2884
just to understand the point of value of komodo

[30-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810

"do other platforms have a quantum resistant signature module?" - it's a technical issue not a political one... is it hard to implement it in other blockchains?

[30-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just copy and paste the code, i am sure it will just work with any blockchain

[30-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
all code is perfectly easy to mix and match, especially blockchain consensus code

[30-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
is that what you are thinking?

[30-Apr-19 12:58 PM] artik123#2884
just asking... because I know you have implemented it in a couple of days

[30-Apr-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and why are you dismissive of technical issues? when we are talking about technical costs?

[30-Apr-19 12:58 PM] artik123#2884
I'm not dismissive

[30-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a quantum resistant chain QRL that has in its roadmap to get dilithium added to it, maybe in a year, not sure the details but it is most definitely not easy to change blockchain consensus

[30-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
once it becomes politics you cant even change the blocksize, when it is changing a #define

[30-Apr-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
I am talking only about technical issues

[30-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are swayed by political issues and will believe whatever somebody else is saying, then why to bother with analyzing anything

[30-Apr-19 01:01 PM] artik123#2884
so komodo chain is more modular to add new tech as with new tweakable parameters?

you havent been understanding what I have been saying all this time?

CC is designed to modify blockchains at the consensus level

and it is 100x more efficient than other ways
