it will be public knowledge how much funds are accumulated

[21-Jun-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it is public knowledge it will be converted to KMD

[21-Jun-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i wont be chasing prices and likely would just put reasonable offers on the books and wait

[21-Jun-19 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no strict deadline to convert and payout, so there wont be any special event for people to front run

[21-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Ok, however  you did not say if you will announce the buy order place , e.g . list of buy orders by initiated by the fee conversion processes

[21-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
above: "i would want to buy the KMD at the best price possible, so i would only announce after the conversion is done"

[21-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and front runners can only be you or insiders in the team

[21-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
my duty is to the hodlers of DEX

[21-Jun-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
what front runners?

[21-Jun-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i place order at X and wait

[21-Jun-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if you put an order above X, it fills before, ok, so?

[21-Jun-19 07:43 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes you duty is also to for them to be informed how there fees will be converted and when

[21-Jun-19 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[21-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so know how their revs is used

[21-Jun-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i do not have a duty to disclose details that would make it more expensive to convert

[21-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Coin2stable#1872
other wise it can be missed used , traded with , speculated with

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is on the blockchain, how to misuse or speculate without being detected??

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
you can essentially play with investors earnings

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
send it to a CEX exchange leverage it

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
dexfees would be aggregated and then converted, it is all on the blockchain, nothing hidden

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont use CEX

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and have fun trading and if money is lost you can always clam hack

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
why would i do such silly things?

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont trust me, then dont buy any DEX

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
thats ok

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Coin2stable#1872
just saying investor will need transparency on which order

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain provides the transparency

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
historically, even when there is a hack, i have madegood to the people who lost funds

[21-Jun-19 07:46 PM] Coin2stable#1872
only when investors know which address is placing the order

[21-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
will the be possible

[21-Jun-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the address is public

[21-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
this

[21-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so I will know what each  DEX earning fee address is doing

[21-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so I can track it KMD buy order on mm2

[21-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and make an account , that is balanced not just me

[21-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872
but other DEX holders

i have proven i am a good manager of funds

[21-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont have confidence in me, best to sell it, a lot of people looking to buy now

[21-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX never did an ICO

[21-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
people just started trading it

[21-Jun-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a company

[21-Jun-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i am responsible to people to get the tech working and when there are enough revenues to distribute it

[21-Jun-19 07:51 PM] willofleo#7505
Nice words I am a pragmatic here,

[21-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not obligated to disclose every step of everything along the way, especially if that would make a worse result for the revshare

[21-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
broadcasting a big buy ahead of time? just so others can make some quick pump money??

[21-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you think that is me, you dont know me

[21-Jun-19 07:52 PM] willofleo#7505
but it is true that investor want to know they are getting something for what they pay .

[21-Jun-19 07:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i have paid out for SUPERNET and CRYPTO and REVS, all transparent, all on the blockchain, recorded

[21-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont gamble with peoples money

[21-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
though you might consider the specific timing i convert as a bit of a gamble due to market fluctuations, but i dont see a way to avoid that

[21-Jun-19 07:54 PM] Coin2stable#1872
, However DEX value is based on it the earning potential

[21-Jun-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i managed to get a nice 50% boost with the CRYPTO payout with good timing, so it does help

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
if you did what you liked the investors will lose fate and sell all their holdings

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what does disclosing details that harms the revshare have to do with earning potential, other than to lower it?

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then sell

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if after all i have done, you dont have faith, then i strongly suggest to sell

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
in fact you can say f*** You I am not paying Sh

[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872

[21-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i am obligated to payout, i will

[21-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i have honored all my promises through the years

[21-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i have handled hundreds of millions of dollars worth

[21-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and guess what nobody can do anything, investors are the vulnerable ones not you and dont forget investors made you .

[21-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i never forget the investors, i manage the funds for them

[21-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont disclose silly details that harms the results

[21-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
all is transparent on the blockchain

[21-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes but what if you where forced to not honor  them

[21-Jun-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[21-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Coin2stable#1872
I am sure there are many ways , you are a single point of attack

[21-Jun-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
how many DEX do you own?

[21-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Coin2stable#1872
which is another problem

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so you need to be safe

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, DEX has many problems, but notice we are not promoting it at all. it just exists. we didnt do an ICO. it is just a legacy revshare

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how many DEX do you have?

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
why , not alot

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
hoping to get more in the future

[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
well you sure are giving me the third degree

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
even if something happened to me, the worst is that whatever revshares pending are lost

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Coin2stable#1872
So I know your the real deal

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
do you know my history?

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Well jl777 not jl77c  ( jl777 copy)

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
even without me, the revshare is changed to a new address and whoever controls that would be able to distribute out the funds

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i am jl777 and jl77b and jl777c

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Coin2stable he is real deal, and honoured his words whenever it came to dealing with money.

well you sound different

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been a stressful month

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I lived my living based on my earning solely based on words and trust and he paid me for my work. NO CONTRACTS!

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Coin2stable#1872
to early days alittle less hungry

[21-Jun-19 08:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do not know any other person in industry who I can trust and be as honourable as James.

[21-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Coin2stable#1872
more like an assistant

[21-Jun-19 08:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If you don't trust, just sell your DEX. You'll find enough buyers.

[21-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Coin2stable#1872
You know @grewalsatinder  I have imagining the best future for DEX , and in that future that much money can change a man

[21-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Coin2stable#1872
imagine 1 millions earned per week

[21-Jun-19 08:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then save yourself from that future. Sell.

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand things change, and if things are not looking in your favour get rid of them.

[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Ok you sound very loyal
