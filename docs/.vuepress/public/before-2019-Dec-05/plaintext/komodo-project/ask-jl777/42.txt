@stefjazar after spending some time experimenting with beam (mimblewimble) found out it is an interactive protocol and not noninteractive. basically it is like barterdex where both sender and receiver need to be online at the same time, for every transaction. seems not very practical. maybe grin is noninteractive, not sure

Hi @jl777c , Hope you doing great. We would like your insight as we are working on promoting real life use case for KSB (stable coin), we would like to find or encourage the use of KSB as a transactional medium (medium of exchange & unit of account) and wonder if you would be aware of projects related to the Komodo Platform, type decentralize market place, merchant or service providers that could use  a stable coin feature. @SHossain said that you would probably be the best person to answer this question. Cheers

the beam devs seem to be saying mimblewimble is an interactive protocol and as such it seems unlikely to gain mass acceptance

[26-Dec-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the latter is my conjecture

so it seems this widely anticipated protocol has some significant downside that few other crypto coins have.

[26-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jspook16#3059
so is the assumption that  nodes are always up?

[26-Dec-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i am working with them to hopefully improve things

[26-Dec-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but the MW protocol requires sender and receiver to both be involved. initial implementation uses a direct connection, but I hope the tx can be split into two halfs to gain noninteractiveness

[26-Dec-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about grin implementation, just been fiddling with beam as it is in C++

[26-Dec-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you can cancel a tx that didnt complete, so it isnt any loss of funds issues, just works in a way very different than other crypto so some additional work is needed. for v1 release i think just a working implementation is a great achievement

seems the answer is in the relation of `-j` to RAM, it's a litlle higher than 2:1, so if $(nproc) = 24 then 8G isn't nearly enough

[27-Dec-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
that makes sense. each j thread would use the same amount of RAM

Where can I find info about the superset asset holdings?

When will there be a payout to supernet holders again? Is there a way to see how much income Supernet has created since the last payout?

[02-Jan-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the bear market reduced revenues by a lot, so far only about $250k in CRYPTO revenues

[02-Jan-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
until bull market is back, i wouldnt expect another revshare

[02-Jan-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
https://www.dexstats.info/gui/index.php?base=SUPERNET&rel=KMD has the current bid/ask, holdings are updated in ~/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges/prices

[02-Jan-19 11:44 AM] Dave123#3592
Thanks for your answer. I was an Ico investor in Supernet and I know the original vision change over the years. Is there plan for Supernet going forward?
In the sense of acquiring additional revenues by investing in project like you did in the past or how is Supernet benefiting from the developments in Komodo?

[02-Jan-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i do try to increase the long term NAV with strategic trading, but as largest KMD holder, what is good for KMD is good for SuperNET. Over next year or so, I hope that 100% of the initial capital raised would have been revshared out. that would make any remaining value pure profits. The problem is that there isnt really anybody else that helps me with SuperNET side of things and only so much I can do

Thank you I found more information about reddit it's not quite what I thought it was... but it remains an interesting topic... I was already investigating the generation of the 2FA sequence..

[02-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Dave123#3592
The asset holdings where there as a reserve for development cost and for investing and acquiring new rev streams. Supernet had a big vision in the beginning but it seems there is noone actively working on it anymore or even a future plan. So what is the point in keeping the Supernet asset holdings and not distribute it to the Supernet holders?
I as an investor am trapped in an iliquid asset.

[02-Jan-19 12:30 PM] owerache#0341
I was planning to develop a hardware + screen that would show me my 2FA keys in relation to different private keys

[02-Jan-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@Dave123 if in 2019 we cant get more forward movement with SuperNET, it will be something to be considered.

[02-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the downside is by doing this, it would prevent any future developments for the various other assetchains and it is a step that cant be undone

[02-Jan-19 01:18 PM] crumb#2550
please correct me if i'm wrong here jl777, but my understanding of supernet asset is that all the different elements of the ecosystem like CRYPTO, DEX, JUMBLR, PANGEA etc will start to produce revenues with ever increasing volumes.

is is just way too early to expect to see this. yes, the lack of liquidity can be/ is an issue for some people, but the intrinsic value of SUPERNET does not increase with more back-and-forth trading of the SUPERNET asset, but with the adoption of the underlying projects that SUPERNET own.

this reminds me of a saying of Warren Buffett: "I try to invest in such companies that even when the markets will be turned off for 10 years, i will still be confident that my investments are doing just fine" more liquidity is always good, but there is just too much emphasis on short term speculation.

SUPERNET is not an instrument for short term speculation, but a long term view on whole blockchain ecosystem. i suggest NOT to dismantle it. people just have to understand what they invest in.

[02-Jan-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks. i guess if there are more people that feel this way and can help with developing the other assetchains, then it wont all be up to me

[02-Jan-19 01:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i would also agree that SUPERNET is not for short-term. hodl is the way since the SuperNET ico

[02-Jan-19 01:26 PM] Dave123#3592
You could distribute 90% of the asset holdings and keep 10% for future opportunities in KMD. I bet noone would be opposed to this.
No offense but the asset holdings of Supernet also lack accountability.
You are the one with the private kees and noone is able to verify if these coins are really in your possession or not and if something happens to you these holding are gone.

[02-Jan-19 01:31 PM] Dave123#3592
@crumb I am by no means a short term investor but I see little progress being made on Supernets original vision. There seem to be also very little further development cost so why not distribute these funds? I am not suggesting to dismantle Supernet at all.

[02-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
realistically without 90% of the funds, there is no way any meaningful development can be done with any of the assetchains

[02-Jan-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
even with 100% of the funds in bear market conditions there isnt enough

[02-Jan-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there will be a distribution it will be to shutdown the SuperNET

[02-Jan-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
this process will take quite of bit of my time to do, so the path of least resistance is for things to proceed as they are. for people that want to cashout, maybe we can start an OTC trading?

[02-Jan-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
or agree to price here and close trade on the exchanges it trades on

[02-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Dave123#3592
Hi so what develpment of assetchains are you referring to? I was curious about future plans for revenue streams but it seems all pretty vague.

[02-Jan-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
first step is to get a project manager for each

[02-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Dave123#3592
each?

[02-Jan-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
or just one

[02-Jan-19 01:47 PM] crumb#2550
most active assetchain now is probably DEX with marketmaker2.0 in development @Dave123

[02-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Dave123#3592
you are talking about CRYPTO, DEX, JUMBLR, PANGEA or what are you referring to?

[02-Jan-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
PANGEA and BET are also in progress via CHIPS

[02-Jan-19 01:48 PM] crumb#2550
yes, them too

[02-Jan-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
CRYPTO is basically complete as it is notarization fees

[02-Jan-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
JUMBLR has been done, but few people use it so it is not such a direct revenue source

[02-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Dave123#3592
Ok maybe I just lost track along the way and things are still evolving.

[02-Jan-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so really most of the tech aspects are complete or near complete

[02-Jan-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I just dont have the bandwidth do to more than help on the tech side

[02-Jan-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and the strategic investing

[02-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Dave123#3592
Why is it that there is still very little volume on baterdex?

[02-Jan-19 01:51 PM] crumb#2550

[02-Jan-19 01:51 PM] crumb#2550
makertmaker1.0 has some shortcomings

[02-Jan-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
its not mm1 but the GUI for mm1 that have the shortcomings

[02-Jan-19 01:51 PM] crumb#2550
this is why MM2.0 is being done

[02-Jan-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 will allow simple GUI to be more effective

[02-Jan-19 01:52 PM] crumb#2550
it's the combo between gui and mm

[02-Jan-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but still people like to use CEX more than DEX

[02-Jan-19 01:52 PM] crumb#2550
classic chicken-and-egg stuff

[02-Jan-19 01:54 PM] crumb#2550
not enough volume -> so people don't come
people don't come because not enough volume

[02-Jan-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if people want faster progress, some will need to step up. otherwise it is to wait as i make slow progress

[02-Jan-19 01:55 PM] crumb#2550
HyperDEX is a very good example of stepping up

[02-Jan-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
or we can just shut it down to appease the need for liquidity

[02-Jan-19 01:56 PM] crumb#2550
why on earth should things be shut down, because some people feel impatient?

[02-Jan-19 01:56 PM] Dave123#3592
@jl777c Ok maybe you can make an short update for Supernet holders on how things are progressing if you find some time. Its really hard to not loose track after all that time.

[02-Jan-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
