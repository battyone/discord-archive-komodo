not notary nodes

[08-Jan-19 05:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
well to be more accurate, notary nodes validate a block just like any other regular network nodes

[08-Jan-19 05:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the network nodes having a full copy of blockchain on their machine

[08-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
how does the notarization knows it was not manipulated by an attack?

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
I mean the notary nodes, how do they know

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you the regular user have the bitcoin wallet with full blockchain on your machine.
and there is a double spend tx happened, you understand how that block with invalidate tx is invalidated?

[08-Jan-19 05:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is based on verifying the data from local synchronised database and the data coming from the network  validated by a miner

[08-Jan-19 05:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if a early block had the same tx spent, it invalidates the new double spend tx

[08-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, and in case someone has more then 50% manipulated blockchain copys?

[08-Jan-19 05:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is the usual satoshi consensus

[08-Jan-19 05:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the addition what dPoW adds to that is it adds a consensus rule of making it *impossible* to reorg the block height past the notarised block

[08-Jan-19 05:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if for example a last block known to be notarised is 2 blocks ago

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the only time span is the time between the next notarised block you can plan and try any kind of 51% attack

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not so sufficient time

[08-Jan-19 05:25 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
you can only manipulate the last 10 Minutes that still are not notarized, yes, that I know

[08-Jan-19 05:26 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
but what prevents that a new manipulated block gets through?

[08-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you are confused

[08-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you are assuming there is an "evil" block and a "good" block

[08-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is only valid blocks and invalid blocks

[08-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is valid, it is valid

[08-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of who mines it, if a block is valid, it is valid

[08-Jan-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, then it is prevented from being overwritten, even if there is a longer (otherwise valid) chain

[08-Jan-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if an attacker is secret mining what he hopes to be the longer chain that double spends, the moment a height is notarized that is after the start of his secret chain, his secret chain is no longer considered

[08-Jan-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the public chain is what gets notarized

[08-Jan-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
as the notaries can only see blocks that are public

[08-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes I may be confused, but I got that part, that the past blocks cannot be altered anymore if protected by dPoW. What I still not get 100% is, what prevents the notary nodes to be manipulated and to add a valid block, but some that was manipulated (is that posssible?)

[08-Jan-19 05:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@tobias what matters isn't that a block is 'good' or 'evil' according to miner's intentions, it matters only that it can't be overwritten. An attacker can produce as many blocks as he wishes but, unless he can overwrite a previous block, there's no actual attack taking place!

[08-Jan-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming you corrupt the majority of notaries, you could make them make up any sort of invalid notarization

[08-Jan-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
which would then be IGNORED by all the nodes, that are validating all notarizations

[08-Jan-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries that are not corrupted only notarize valid blocks

[08-Jan-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but regardless, ALL nodes (miners,wallets, etc) are validating ALL notarizations

[08-Jan-19 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so in a majority notary corrupted scenario, you cant prevent the wrong block from being notarized, but it wont have any effect as it is an invalid block and ignored by the rest of the network

[08-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, but what happens to the notarized history then, if the last wrong block is already in the BTC chain as well and is ignored? Is it pulled then? I cannot imagine how it works as the blocks are nested.

[08-Jan-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
invalid notarizations are IGNORED

[08-Jan-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
what part of that is confusing?

[08-Jan-19 05:41 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
the last sentence you wrote I understood, that it could theoretical happen that a wrong block gets into the BTC chain via dPoW, or did I misunderstand?

[08-Jan-19 05:41 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
and I understood, that it would not be a problem, because that wrong block would be ignored then

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
or did you mean it different?

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
in the EXTREMELY unlikely event a wrong block gets into the BTC chain, it is IGNORED

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, ok

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
that I udnerstand

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW protects even against the extremely unlikely

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and all nodes validate

[08-Jan-19 05:42 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, I believe that

[08-Jan-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the only trust given to notaries are to differentiate between valid blockhashes and selecting the notarized chain

[08-Jan-19 05:43 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
and how can the blocks be ignored? by skipping? and the next block notarized is referring to the current block - 2  ?

[08-Jan-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but the normal consensus rules are always running and notarizations are crosschecking against that

[08-Jan-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if a notarization is ignored, it is exactly like it didnt happen at all

[08-Jan-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ignore, as in pretend it doesnt exist

[08-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
so it reffers to current block - 2

[08-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
?

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
what referal?

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you are assuming things that dont exist, are somehow existing

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes check for valid notarizations

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if they see one, they update the notarized height

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
dont overcomplicate it

[08-Jan-19 05:45 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
I thought that blocks are referred to the last block before

[08-Jan-19 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes check for valid notarizations
if they see one, they update the notarized height

[08-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, maybe I got it. So nodes are going through all the notarized blocks and those who are wrong are ignored, right? I mean, if someday that even would happen

[08-Jan-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
a notarization is a normal transaction

[08-Jan-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
as a new block comes in, it is scanned for a valid notarization

[08-Jan-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
by valid notarization, that means it is a valid block already in that nodes blockchain

[08-Jan-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if it sees such a notarization, it updates its state to have a new notarized height

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the other thing it does is that if it sees a block trying to overwrite a notarized block, it rejects it

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
that is all that it does

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
99.9% it is the same as normal consensus for the chain

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no magic

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
just scanning for valid notarizations and updating the current notarized height

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is any magic, it is in the creation of the notarized tx, but the NN take care of that

[08-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, thank you, I think I understood it now.

[08-Jan-19 06:41 PM] richardt#2807
Just a thought:  Komodo could have a technology demonstration for more people to understand how the security mechanism works.  Create a test blockchain with dPOW enabled and try to 51% attack it and see what happens.  Has this been done before?

[08-Jan-19 08:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@richardt it's happened to EMC2 by an attacker pre-announcing the attack, and also Hush DPoW was recently tested by KMD people, to verify it works correctly. And it did üòÉ

[08-Jan-19 09:48 PM] richardt#2807
Nice.  It would be pretty amazing for KMD if ETC decides to go with dPOW to secure itself.  It seems to me they're at a dead-end and need some kind of solution fast or people will stop trusting it altogether.

[08-Jan-19 09:51 PM] Instel7#1416
@richardt EMC2 has already recommended them to implement it üôÇ https://twitter.com/einsteiniumcoin/status/1082593492646404096

@etherchain_org We hope #ETC comes out of this 51% attack with little or no damage.
We warmly recommend implementing dPoW by #KMD 
It worked really well for #EMC2 https://t.co/5XzOLLVmT4

What is your opinion about new consensus called hashgraph?? It is not block chain and they have patent and it is not open source. They claim it is more efficient and secure than block chain

[09-Jan-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810

so its open source, but patented?

[09-Jan-19 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
looks like "open core", only plugins/extra stuff is open source, I don't see the core technology on Github: https://github.com/hashgraph/

`Hedera Hashgraph is a public distributed ledger based on the Hashgraph algorithm which in 2018 raised $100 million at a $6 billion market cap.` seems a bit fishy to me. Sure is a lot of money and valuation on unproven technology

[09-Jan-19 07:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
