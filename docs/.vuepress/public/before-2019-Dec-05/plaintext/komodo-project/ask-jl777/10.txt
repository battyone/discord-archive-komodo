I'll admit its not really apparent tho

For example the Nem mosaic is perfect. It's a little tile you create on Nem. It's not a blockchain

In any case, I feel it needs to be decided because it's affecting the service providers when trying to create content to explain Komodo

@jl777c where can I read up on the difficulty algo related to notaries? because I'd imagine malicious notaries may be able to abuse their mining priviliges?

[29-Jun-18 12:08 PM] ProficieNt#3097
btw, how does the community veto / kick notaries? can a vote be called?

[29-Jun-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries get to mine at easy diff once per 65 blocks

[29-Jun-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
with 64 notaries there is room for some underperforming notaries, the annual election will sort that out

[29-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
a single notary couldnt really do much to abuse their mining, a 1.6% attack isnt very strong

[29-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
certianly if all the notaries are compromised, then we have a problem

[29-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but a lot of notaries are known community members

[29-Jun-18 12:11 PM] ProficieNt#3097
the ratio of notary mined blocks to standard is 3:1 but 64/65 blocks a notary will get a chance to mine one, how does that play out?

[29-Jun-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries add delayes to their mining where longer and logner random delays are added the loser the external mining percentage gets

[29-Jun-18 12:12 PM] ProficieNt#3097
is there a document on this algorithm?

[29-Jun-18 12:12 PM] ProficieNt#3097
or something i could search for

[29-Jun-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
a dishonest notary could get 20% more blocks, but they would be found out

[29-Jun-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the code is the documentation in this case:

[29-Jun-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
if ( gpucount < 33 )
            {
                uint8_t tmpbuffer[40]; uint32_t r; int32_t n=0; uint256 randvals;
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&My_notaryid,sizeof(My_notaryid)), n += sizeof(My_notaryid);
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&Mining_height,sizeof(Mining_height)), n += sizeof(Mining_height);
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&pblock->hashPrevBlock,sizeof(pblock->hashPrevBlock)), n += sizeof(pblock->hashPrevBlock);
                vcalc_sha256(0,(uint8_t *)&randvals,tmpbuffer,n);
                memcpy(&r,&randvals,sizeof(r));
                pblock->nTime += (r % (33 - gpucount)*(33 - gpucount));
            }

[29-Jun-18 12:14 PM] ProficieNt#3097
if honest notaries should be mining 1.17% of the blocks, you're saying a dishonest notary could mine 1.4% of the blocks but it would be obvious to the public

[29-Jun-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Jun-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
all the notary statistics are closely monitored by the notaries

[29-Jun-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
doing such things would disqualify a notary

[29-Jun-18 12:16 PM] ProficieNt#3097
okay and if someone, or a group of people, start abusing the network the community could hardfork? or is there a protocol level way to kick notaries

[29-Jun-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if majority of notaries area compromised, a hardfork seems the only safe way to correct things

[29-Jun-18 12:17 PM] ProficieNt#3097
if around 5 start performing selfish mining attacks and trying to gain more control?

[29-Jun-18 12:17 PM] ProficieNt#3097
how could they be dealt with?

[29-Jun-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
most notary operators are known community members

[29-Jun-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
loss of reputation would be a big loses, and wouldnt it take closer to 20 notaries to do selfih mining, unless you mean the 1.4%

[29-Jun-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
notary corruption is unlikely and in any case it is visbiel and correctable if the unlikely happens

[29-Jun-18 12:18 PM] ProficieNt#3097
correctable through a hard fork though?

[29-Jun-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes,we have a sheduled annual hardfork

[29-Jun-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and we use it to activate new consusus changes at the same time

[29-Jun-18 12:20 PM] ProficieNt#3097
okay, and if someone is caught buying votes they are disqualified through social consensus?

[29-Jun-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes there is an in-between hardfork

[29-Jun-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is impossible to detect buying of votes

[29-Jun-18 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and if KMD holder wants to give his voting decision to someone else, that in  a way is his decision

[29-Jun-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there are all sorts of doomsday theories how all the notaries will be planted zombies and such nonsense. the reality is that the community makes a serious decision about who the 64 are, as the last elections showed

[29-Jun-18 12:22 PM] ProficieNt#3097
okay, fair enough. how do asset chains pay for notarization? As I understand, that is currently a manual process?

[29-Jun-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, notaries need to get the coin being notarized and the KMD to cover the notarizing txfees (but not the BTC txfees that are already paid)

[29-Jun-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
an the notaries have to start running the coin, and the notarize it. there is no way to automate that, so it is necessarily a manual pricess

[29-Jun-18 12:27 PM] ProficieNt#3097
I'm just wondering what the reason for requiring 13 notaries to reach consensus? Would it not be possible to let anyone notarize and it to just be a part of the normal mining process?

[29-Jun-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
where is the incentive for them to notarize?

[29-Jun-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
without a decent number notarizing how to know it is very likely the mainchain?

[29-Jun-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
without knowing who the noataries are how would we know who is notarizing? and if they are not known then there is no reputation loss, to prevent playing games

[29-Jun-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so, yes it is possible, but we have a public election process, etc. not sure what is gained from  anonymous randome notarizers

[29-Jun-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it seem you are trying to make problems out of non-issues

[29-Jun-18 12:35 PM] ProficieNt#3097
1) To secure their chain of PoW, with SCs you could attach a bounty to proving notarization.
2) Surely you can have individuals optionally run the Bitcoin blockchain. If someone tries to fake that Merkle tree, the nodes with the BTC chain can send a proof showing that the merkle was invalid and the others can ignore the previous notarization. (not sure how this works but might help: https://blog.kyber.network/chain-relays-or-a-practical-approach-for-cross-chain-trades-d0d7003f266b)
3) We build systems that don't need trust because they are more efficient and resilient.

[29-Jun-18 12:36 PM] ProficieNt#3097
if you make notarization anonymous using incentives, you can support many more chains and without any middleman handling the money

i thoguht btc relay was discontinued, the daily cost of ETH txfee was $10,000+ or something like that

[29-Jun-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
nice theoretical solutions are nice, but until  it is proven you can get regular BTC notarizations with miners upfronting the BTC and somehow coordinating with each other, it is unproven

[29-Jun-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
trusting  BTC relay to exist is not any better

[29-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
maybe not the BTC cost

[29-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
but from other chains into KMD

[29-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ProficieNt#3097
that should be automated and can be

[29-Jun-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
such enhancements are not prohibited and likely will be done

[29-Jun-18 12:43 PM] ProficieNt#3097
and why do the miners need to coordinate?

[29-Jun-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the BTC fees are the big hurdle

[29-Jun-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you will trust a single anonymous notarizer? doesnt that open up a lot more minority attack vectors

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
you dont trust anyone, you trust the BTC blockchains

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
a losing fork can be notarized by a single miner? seems very weak

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
*blockchain

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
look, the problem with BTC is its slow so yes its not perfect

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
but smaller coins into MKD

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
*KMD

[29-Jun-18 12:44 PM] ProficieNt#3097
you should be able to anonymize and automate the proccess

[29-Jun-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
any blockchain is always in flux, also we are believing that BTC tx when it goes into the mempool

[29-Jun-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the odds of it not getting eventually confirmed are very small

[29-Jun-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
thiough it is of course better when there isnt a mempool backlog

[29-Jun-18 12:46 PM] ProficieNt#3097
okay, forget BTC

[29-Jun-18 12:46 PM] ProficieNt#3097
we are trying to make Komodo the best it can be

[29-Jun-18 12:47 PM] ProficieNt#3097
so, it seems that automatic notarization on KMD is relatively straight forward and would be a big bonus to the network? it decreases a central reliance on notary nodes and makes the protocol more resilient

[29-Jun-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure it is relatively straight forward, but I would definitely consider such a pull request as long as there are no issues found by the anonymous and lack of N nodes in agreement

[29-Jun-18 12:56 PM] ProficieNt#3097
where do you see problems? the main pre-requisite is a scripting language / smart contracts so these chains can manage their notarizations

[29-Jun-18 12:58 PM] ProficieNt#3097
the contract has a function submitNotarization() which takes a block header / proof as an argument. It has a second function submitChallenge() which lets someone challenge a previous submission by submitting a block that shows an earlier inclusion of the notarization TX. If they do this, the previous notarization is removed and the new notarization is accepted

[29-Jun-18 12:58 PM] ProficieNt#3097
that's probably a naive SC implementation but you guys are the devs here so you tell me üòõ

[29-Jun-18 01:01 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c the current solution requires notaries to run every child chain, right?

[29-Jun-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Jun-18 01:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@ProficieNt I‚Äôm not sure this helps, but I saw you mentioning everyone should be able to notarize. Technically anyone can setup a tier 2 Notary Node network and notarize whatever coins they wanna run to KMD. So technically you could run your own private NN‚Äôs to notarize your private assetchain to KMD for example. As for notarizing to BTC, as James said it‚Äôs very expensive so that‚Äôs why the KMD team covers paying the btc fees for the elected (tier 1) NN‚Äôs.

[29-Jun-18 01:05 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@jl777c this will pose great scalability issues, issues that trustless notarization will solve

[29-Jun-18 01:05 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@xRobeSx but that mechanism still requires you to trust someone. someone who probably isnt as trustworthy as the current notaries

[29-Jun-18 01:06 PM] ProficieNt#3097
im suggesting a mechanism by which you trust no one, in the sense that anyone can be a notary and prove if someone is disingenuous

[29-Jun-18 01:06 PM] ProficieNt#3097
add a few economic incentives and you've got a highly scalable protocol

[29-Jun-18 01:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm just saying in the scenario I just mentioned, you wouldn‚Äôt have to trust the notarization to KMD as you could do it yourself with your own NN‚Äôs. As for the KMD -> BTC notarization of the previous, you‚Äôd be trusting just the elected NN‚Äôs

[29-Jun-18 01:08 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm not trying to persuade your thinking, just bringing up another angle, as I don‚Äôt think many people realize there can be sub NN tiers

[29-Jun-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this is all in the realm of possible, the subNN is not enabled yet, it is needing a bit more work

[29-Jun-18 01:11 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Oh thanks for the clarification James. I thought it was possible and @SHossain was using a subNN to notarize the scaling chains

[29-Jun-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is called a notarizing testnet

[29-Jun-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
for testing, not mainchain use (yet)

[29-Jun-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, the notarization group can be customized with an external JSON config file

[29-Jun-18 01:23 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@xRobeSx are we building a blokchain or an SQL database? why should my network participants trust me to solely manage notarization?

[29-Jun-18 01:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not saying just you. You could setup 1 private NN and maybe release documentation for anyone using your coin to notarize it?  Maybe you could make the first assetchain that has decentralized notarizations üòÉ

[29-Jun-18 01:29 PM] ProficieNt#3097
dont have a use for an asset chain personally haha

[29-Jun-18 01:29 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Komodo is supposed to provide utility to small PoW chains, not have small PoW chains build features for Komodo üòõ
