5% reward just is, they come from nothing.

[22-Jun-18 10:29 AM] gcharang#6833
It's part of the inflation mechanism coded into the coin(Similar to block reward awarded to miners). All the komodo miners accept the claim of reward because that is a part of the consensus protocol.

@Alright we are still working out all the details on dynamically expanding a cluster. first step is to get it to work and we just achieved that. I think it would be a good test to make a new chain with same clusterid and see if this unauthorized chain can do the burn protocol with the official cluster chains. If so, it is a bug and we will fix it

[22-Jun-18 07:27 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm curious about the Turing completeness of Komodo smart contract, will it be Turing-completed ?

[22-Jun-18 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont design things to meet abstract litmus tests, like "turing complete" (which i think actually requires infinite storage which no practical system can have). Rather, I design to solve the actual things that need to be solved. So describe a specific useful smart contract and I can tell you if it will be supported

[22-Jun-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
from wikipedia: To show that something is Turing complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system. For example, an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional branching (e.g., "if" and "goto" statements, or a "branch if zero" instruction; see one instruction set computer) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items). Of course, no physical system can have infinite memory; but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing complete.

[22-Jun-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so an incomplete turing completeness litmus test?

[22-Jun-18 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I ask why is that important

[22-Jun-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
let us make a list of specific smart contracts and then just make sure all of them are supported, ie be able to change parameters and other practical customizations that real world usages will want to do

[22-Jun-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps are a smart contract, it does the job it is supposed to do, yet it isnt turing complete, even the incomplete definition. So does that make atomic swaps not useful?

[22-Jun-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
If the problem at hand is solved, I claim that the problem at hand is solved, regardless of its turing completeness

[22-Jun-18 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
Also, notice that if we dont have to make a turing complete contracts, we can avoid a massive amount of security  issues  not to mention the effort required to make it turing complete. So why build something that will certainly create security issues if it isnt needed.

[22-Jun-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I like to iterate from the simplest possible solution and if that isnt sufficient to add a bit more. I stop when the problem is solved. I expect we wont have to go to full turing completeness (with finite mem) in order to be able to run 99% of the useful smart contracts

[22-Jun-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the logic used is that "a turing complete contracts system can solve any smart contract, so if we had a turing complete system we are golden"

[22-Jun-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
this misses the very real risks satoshi designed the bitcoin script system to avoid and then then disabled most of those opcodes!

[22-Jun-18 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the turing question is a misdirection!! The better question is "can the smart contract system solve the problem it needs to solve without creating giant security attack vectors and unknowns"

[22-Jun-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
So while a turing complete system would be able to say it can implement any contract, it isnt without a giant caveat, ie. any contract includes a lot of contracts with undesirable behavior.

@jl777c  I just ask that question out of my curiosity,  I didn't mean to imply Turing completed is better, I remember reading somewhere that most Ethereum contract can be written in non Turing completed language, Solidity is flexible but vulnerable at the same time, so I just wonder which direction Komodo's smart contracts will take, thanks for the long  & detailed answer 😃

[23-Jun-18 03:28 PM] Acura#2748
If I understood it correctly, it would be possible to exchange coins via Smart Contracts (MoMoM) - the question would now be whether it would make the DEX asset rather obsolete in order to pay dividends? Or i´m thinking in the wrong direction ?

[23-Jun-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
artem is leading the group, we just added another coder. also luke and his team will be helping

[23-Jun-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
MoMoM burn protocol is just one of the nearly infinite possible types of contracts. The MoMoM burn can maintain the total coins in a cluster, even while coins are moved from one chain to another. they are kind of like all being sidechains to each other. this wont work for generalized DEX

Ok Thx for your Answer Jl777 😃

[26-Jun-18 07:01 PM] vasa#4326
I have a question about dPoS.

[26-Jun-18 07:02 PM] vasa#4326
The dPoS Wiki says that: Within this scheme, each notary is allowed to mine one block at its current difficulty rate, while the other notary nodes must mine at 10 time higher and all the normal nodes will always mine at 100 times the difficulty rate of the notary nodes.

[26-Jun-18 07:03 PM] vasa#4326
What is the reason behind putting high difficulty to the other nodes than the mining node?

[26-Jun-18 07:03 PM] vasa#4326
I couldn't figure out the problem it is solving...

[26-Jun-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW not dPoW, this text appears to be confused.

[26-Jun-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries get to mine at easy diff once per 65 blocks

[26-Jun-18 07:10 PM] vasa#4326
Yeah..sorry about that

[26-Jun-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
other than that the diff works normally

[26-Jun-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no matter how high the hashrate goes, the notaries will get about 75% of the blocks

[26-Jun-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this allows notaries to know they will get revenues coming in

[26-Jun-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is ASIC resistant

[26-Jun-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also it makes it that much harder to get 51% the hashrate as many of the notaries would have to be compromised

[26-Jun-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the problem of paying for notary nodes, securing the chain, resisting ASIC

[26-Jun-18 07:13 PM] vasa#4326
That's great...the thing that :the notaries will get about 75% of the blocks

[26-Jun-18 07:13 PM] vasa#4326
Is this some rule in the consensus?

[26-Jun-18 07:14 PM] vasa#4326
Or it is derived from the difficulty other nodes are facing?

[26-Jun-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
we tune the notary mining to achieve the 25%

[26-Jun-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the lower the external miner percentage gets, the slower the notaries take to mine

[26-Jun-18 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the real hashrate has no effect on notaries, they can always mine one in 65 blocks, whether external miners are 10MH, 10GH or 10TH or even 10PH

[26-Jun-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but we need to calibrate it to reality, or the diff can explode. in our early days on testnet the diff did explode up into the billions, so we added the free for all mining, once per 2000 blocks where notaries are not able to mine at easy diff, but they still notarize during this time. This resets the diff to the actal hashrate

[26-Jun-18 07:18 PM] vasa#4326
According to above: 25 % for the non notary miners. right?

[26-Jun-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
approx

[26-Jun-18 07:20 PM] vasa#4326
And I read it in your google docs: Our latest stress test had 1024 chains, and we achieved 20k transactions per second (TPS).

On Komodo, we can include multiple payments on a single transaction, so thus we can also say we made over 800k payments per second.

[26-Jun-18 07:21 PM] vasa#4326
Is it really 800k payments without any failure?

[26-Jun-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it was blockchain based payments

[26-Jun-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
they all confirmed

[26-Jun-18 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if there were any errors during the txblasting, it is just a simulation

[26-Jun-18 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
of many people sending tx at the same time

[26-Jun-18 07:28 PM] vasa#4326
That's really great.

[26-Jun-18 07:28 PM] vasa#4326
Also I like the way your consensus works

[26-Jun-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but now we are almost ready for 1 million tx/sec and 8 million payments/sec

I have been working for about 18 months. I have worked on Ethereum, EOS, Quorum, Hashgraph. But Mostly I have been working on ethereum and ripping it apart to make my modifications on it , to make it a bit better

[26-Jun-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you know, but komodod has the insight-core support built into it now. there are many -addressindex rpc calls also a -spentindex to allow an explorer like insight explorer to just call the coin daemon

then there is the electrumX server that does mostly the same thing to implement api: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html

What I am thinking is that it could be a very small layer that publishes the electrum api and then calls the komodod -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 daemon and for things that dont exist right away (like generating spv proofs, we actually have that code from the MoMoM work)

[26-Jun-18 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810

those komodod rpc calls should make it relatively easy to implement electrum API

[26-Jun-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe even add a -SPV=port option to make a komodod run an electrum server

Relaying ProficieNtOCE question on Reddit:

"But can't a malicious miner with say 60% of hashrate just outpace honest miners and so the natories will always take his chain instead of the honest chain?"

I think what he is asking is "if there are multiple side chains, is mining power divided, and whats to stop someone from taking control of the mining power in one side chain, refusing to mine transactions, or reorganizing the side chain to show all the coins in the miners addresses, then notarizing to KMD and BTC.

what percentage of blocks on the mainchain should notaries be producing?

[26-Jun-18 10:13 PM] ProficieNt#3097
@ComputerGenie I don't understand your comment entirely. The BadMinerA can reject the GoodMiner blocks and outpace them. This way, if they dont comply with his censor list, they wont get their blocks mined

[26-Jun-18 10:13 PM] ProficieNt#3097
im talking with jl about this, maybe he'll answer my questions

[26-Jun-18 10:15 PM] ProficieNt#3097
this is how soft forks generally work, the miners that are in the minority in the soft fork fall behind and stop being able to mine blocks

[26-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
GoodMiner's blocks would still be accepted by notaries

[26-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
and once notarized, they are the real chain

[26-Jun-18 10:29 PM] Alright#0419
BadMiner could do it between notarizations, but it's impossible to predict when a notarization will happen

[26-Jun-18 10:29 PM] ProficieNt#3097
Okay, so imagine this attack on an asset chain notarizing every 20 blocks:
 - Bad Miner has 65% of asset chain hashrate
 - We are at block 100 (it has been notarized)
 - Bad Miner starts mining block 101. He is mining privately so he doesn't publish when he finds a block.
 - Good miners (35%) start mining 101
 - This creates competing private and public chains
 - Bad miner only publishes his chain every 20 blocks so that his chain keeps getting notarized.
- I don't the maths off the top of my head but as you exceed 50% hashrate your chance of being the first to 20 block becomes exponentially greater
 - As miners stop getting rewards they will leave, furthering your hold on the assetchain

[26-Jun-18 10:30 PM] Alright#0419
Badminer can't predict when the public chain will be notarized
