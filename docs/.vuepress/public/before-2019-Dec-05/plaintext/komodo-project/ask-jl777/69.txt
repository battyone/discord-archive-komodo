with viewkeys soon(ish) available, it would make a lot of sense :D
probably there are miners willing to sell big amounts OTC, so shouldn't be any problems

[15-Jun-19 08:01 PM] crumb#2550
or are there any nuances that i'm missing?

[15-Jun-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i like to buy below market price. if you can find me a seller for a few million PIRATE below market, let me know

[15-Jun-19 08:03 PM] crumb#2550
gonna be tricky, that one...

[15-Jun-19 08:30 PM] technofloof#8761
do you know when binance will be reopening the wallet?

[15-Jun-19 08:31 PM] technofloof#8761
anxious to get funds back

[15-Jun-19 08:31 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
By Monday it should open

[15-Jun-19 08:38 PM] technofloof#8761
‚ù§ thank you

[15-Jun-19 08:46 PM] allbits#5898
Does Supernet stake it's Verus?

[15-Jun-19 08:47 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, it seems to be staking

[15-Jun-19 09:02 PM] crumb#2550
asking about Binance or any other exchange relates questions from James is pointless @technofloof . better to ask in #talk-general

@jl777c was just trying to do some calcs, does this look correct?

[16-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, of course starting today, "only" about 80% is possible as there are only about 12 years left

[16-Jun-19 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, that's why made a column for dates/years

[16-Jun-19 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
want to post this to twitter

[16-Jun-19 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
any corrections you want me to add to it?

[16-Jun-19 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like wording etc?

[16-Jun-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks fine, maybe add a "must claim rewards monthly"

[16-Jun-19 06:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right... thanks, gonna do it üòÉ

[16-Jun-19 10:11 AM] klein#5233
Liquidity is king, always has always will be

[16-Jun-19 10:12 AM] klein#5233
and I am bullish BTC because it has the most traded volume against komodo üòé

[16-Jun-19 10:18 AM] criptobear#6402
@grewalsatinder in that table of yours i think there are a couple of typos, for example "KMD and it's..." shouldn't it be "its"? and compunding missing an "o" i think? oh and i think on the bottom it is written reards instead of rewards

[16-Jun-19 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do spelling mistakes

[16-Jun-19 10:19 AM] criptobear#6402
sorry i see this after you published it i woud have blocked you LOL

[16-Jun-19 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Jun-19 10:20 AM] criptobear#6402
me too i do but i think that when somebody  reads a document and sees mistakes, can have the wrong impression you know, IMHO anyway

[16-Jun-19 10:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if the maths is correct, I'll leave it like that

[16-Jun-19 10:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can't make everyone happy

[16-Jun-19 10:22 AM] criptobear#6402

[16-Jun-19 10:22 AM] criptobear#6402

[16-Jun-19 10:23 AM] criptobear#6402
about making happy everybody tell me about it i have 2 children and everyday is a constant unhappy crying drama for one of them

@Deleted User I fear that to

[17-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Flint#6435
@Deleted User  these measures of banks and governments will not keep pace with the achievements of free anonymous developers - they were good in the 20th century - in that paradigm their control system worked well! And now - even taking for example TOR - they can‚Äôt overcome how they don‚Äôt try! After all, they have to hire specialists to confront from among all the same cryptopanks! supporters of decentralization and privacy among developers are much more than those developers in the service of the government! Yes - we will face difficulties - but they will ALWAYS be in the role of catch-up until they understand that it is necessary not to prohibit but to use technology! The world of cars of the future will not communicate in dollar transactions! Most people do not need cryptocurrency - they will have enough steblecoins - but robots and machines with AI - they only need butt for interaction and cryptocurrency and networks built on the principle of decentralization! Maybe not a blockchain but a DAG or something else not invented! And Bitcoin will be just a convenient means of saving value and not a fee for coffee! Although the network lightning will solve this problem like other sidechains! Otherwise, only the invasion of aliens!))

[17-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Mark81#4505
are all BTC addresses claims processed and dust sended? i havent had mine dust yet...

[17-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i sent refunds directly, check your claim addrss

[17-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Mark81#4505
I see it! Thanks!

[17-Jun-19 07:09 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Is this correct?: When the mobile dex makes use (and is dependent on) of dht, then it won't work over tor.

[17-Jun-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure but it seems unlikely to work over tor

[17-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Hmm... Maybe when I tunnel the udp over tor with a vpn? I will just try when the public beta comes out.

[17-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Steff#1446
Hi 
again:) is there a script how to  accept kmd on shopify without coinpayments.
?

[17-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Flint#6435
@Deleted User  their Fiat during the next financial crisis (and it will be - believe me) nobody will need it! Perhaps the new gold-bitcoin trading pair will become popular! - then there will be an interesting sight! You've heard about how Gongkong rich people en masse against the background of protests and extradition laws begin to withdraw capital in offshores! And what is the main offshore of the future. - correctly - anonymous credit currencies! What is more anonymous - the more money will flow into it! Previously, this role was not predicted by ZEC - but time does not stand still and we already have ARRR - this basic protocol with zero knowledge still makes noise that will also be reflected for the KOMODO ecosystem!

[17-Jun-19 08:30 PM] Flint#6435
and you still do not forget about Venezuela where anonymous cryptocurrencies are even more popular than Bitcoin - it remains for them only to get acquainted with ARRR:pirate:

[17-Jun-19 08:33 PM] Flint#6435
straining the strange correlation of KMD and BTC - intersection of graphs - it means people are pouring in dollars - real money is not going to be sold to the project - they accumulate! And speculators are paired with bitcoin now!

[17-Jun-19 09:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
my perhaps naive hope is that the usurping of govt control is already underway

[18-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Flint#6435
@Deleted User  Of course, there is a solution - this is a positive experience of introducing the blockchain into the state system! And countries such as Switzerland, Malta, Georgia, Belarus - an excellent example of how to legalize cryptocurrencies at the national government level in a short time - increase both the investment attractiveness of these countries and the efficiency of the blockchain in the current economic trend to become autonomous without the human factor from which millions of dollars are lost every year from the budget! Code is law! Here is the creed of the new digital age! the rest of the states conducting strict regulation will be noncompetitive in the new economy of the Internet of things of the artificial Internet and the blockchain! And no China and others will stop it! People soon realize the advantages of these technologies over the outdated Fintechs of the 20th century! And most of all, countries with cheap renewable energy will win! Iceland is a good example of the introduction of mining built on geothermal energy - and a positive shift is already visible! Central banks will not be needed! An artificial intelligence machine will not trust the intermediary represented by the bank to interact with another machine - this is not effective!
The only thing with which there will be some time to fight is anonymous cryptocurrency! But this will end when the millenial generation takes over the world!

[18-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Flint#6435
Komodo technology is perfectly integrated into the economic structure of the future economy of robots and artificial intelligence! In the gaming industry alone, you can make a revolution using technologies like ‚Äúgameplay proof‚Äù or something like that ‚Äî along with the development of VR and cloud computing ‚Äî it will revolutionize very soon! It‚Äôs just that everyone is busy ONLY with the price on the markets - paying little attention to the technology itself that is developing exponentially! The KOMODO project in this regard is unique - the very correct development vectors are set and the correct accents not only on Fintech - but also other areas like gaming, oracles, artificial intelligence and distributed file storage!:Komodo:

[18-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Flint#6435
The world of the future is not the power of governments but the power of supranational corporations! This will replace citizenship - people will be differentiated by belonging to the community of a certain corporation centralized and decentralized - if individual countries make an even more friendly environment for the development of a decentralized economy!

@jl777c Any interest in being on a privacy coin related podcast? I'm not able to give away all the details publicly yet. So far, three other privacy coin devs have confirmed attending and waiting on 2 others (aside from you). Also, I'm just the messenger. Don't shoot!

[18-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i only do text

[18-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sure many PIRATE peoples will be interested

[18-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ask @FishyGuts

[18-Jun-19 05:13 PM] camthegeek#4177
I think pirate was the next route, let me check

[18-Jun-19 05:17 PM] camthegeek#4177
PIRATE is more than likely okay. let me know who would like to represent and talk ARRR with the gang and I'll forward the word and get some contact info sent over so I'm not in the middle

[19-Jun-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
actually there were some fixes for mining that might be handy in FSM. let me update dev branch

[19-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
dev is updated with latest

[19-Jun-19 12:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
thanks! will update

[19-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
any pools that report problems with stuck miner should use dev to see if it fixes things

Hi, James! If I have 0.3.4beta Agama wallet untill now, and all my coins and assets in my wallet, is that means that I am Ok with latest security issue? And I can use my old wallet/seed with new Ocean wallet?

[20-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be fine, and oceanQT is a good idea

it is a good practice to rotate passwords in general, something that exists for years has years to be compromised. something that is brand new has no such long time window. but this is just generic advice

@jl777c  I have a few questions about how fees earned for mm2 will be converted .    1. Which exchanges will be used for conversion , CEX or DEX( mm2)       2. Will this be done on bulk all at once a buy wall  ? or periodically .                                              3.  Or will it be an active buy  action in which all sell orders are filled , which will spike the price up ?     4. Will there be news on the time in which orders will be  are placed to prevent front running by insiders including you and close team.  (Buying KMD before hand and then placing the  optimum highest sell order in which initially bought KMD will be filled when all the fees is converted all at once potentially making easy money with insider knowledge among the team or group , also members within the  insider group can all front run each other) .  Your thought thanks

[21-Jun-19 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i plan to use atomicDEX to convert when there is enough to make it worth doing

[21-Jun-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i would want to buy the KMD at the best price possible, so i would only announce after the conversion is done

[21-Jun-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
at scale, the conversions would need to be an ongoing process
