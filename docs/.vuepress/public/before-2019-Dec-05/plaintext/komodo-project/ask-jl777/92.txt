[17-Nov-19 04:23 PM] richardt#2807
That will be the case when LTC and DOGE are no longer in the top. Pretty sure those coins have not been actively developed for years now

[17-Nov-19 04:24 PM] joe2x4#5987
I'm not convinced we actually "are" past that stage. There still are so very few people buying crypto. With new people coming into crypto world, the cycle repeats and the new group looks to the newest offering with fancy roadmap and social media presence who promises to be better then Bitcoin.

[17-Nov-19 04:26 PM] joe2x4#5987
Wasn't k64 just a few months ago? Big promises..  cycle is still repeat.

[17-Nov-19 04:30 PM] joe2x4#5987
Pretty sure Satoshi knew what was doing when Bitcoin was made open source. 1000s and 1000s of coins and promises to dethrone Bitcoin only serve to expand ecosystem. Shitcoins are a feature of Bitcoin.

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!
I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform ‚Äúwhy should anybody hodl KMD‚Äù. Implicit in the‚Ä¶

[17-Nov-19 05:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
This is pretty much the one to read on what gives a coin value

[17-Nov-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think for crypto valuations, it would be similar to real estate. why would  a house that costs $20,000 to build be worth $2 mil? if the neighbor houses are all $2 mil and about the same type of house.

[17-Nov-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no way there would be rents to justify the $2 mil valuation, so it isnt the cashflow

[17-Nov-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there are only so many coins, a finite supply. which is a very new concept for money, so when valuing crypto against something that will forever devalue (fiat), it is just a matter of time before the price of crypto goes up significantly

[17-Nov-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is sort of the hardmoney standard of crypto, with miners spending $5000 to $8000 per coin. if BTC wasnt worth more than that, they wouldnt be doing this. now is BTC worth 10000x what KMD is? is it worth "only" 1000x or 100000x? in real estate you compare to comparables. currently KMD is far away from BTC, so you need to compare it to the others near #50, and each coin in the top 100 is being valued against its neighbors

[17-Nov-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
should BTC be worth more than all the other coins combined? i would say that over time, this cant be sustained, but network effect will keep it there a lot longer than the tech would warrant

[17-Nov-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
approximating to half, then the question is asked about each coin below and what percentage of overall marketcap makes sense, starting with the remaining half. it is only small fractions by the time you get to where KMD is now. using a comparables valuation, it seems KMD is headed higher in the rankings. especially now that china has discovered it

[17-Nov-19 05:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately, the crypto valuation question is answered by whether BTC belongs at #35 on https://fiatmarketcap.com/

[17-Nov-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
when it comes to valuing currencies, its all relative

The chips/atomicdex flow for a game is an interesting point @jspook16 
James has said in the past that it is possible btc won‚Äôt be the king of crypto valuations.  Stablecoins likely.

Where are stablecoins going to be utilized?  In my opinion it is in multichain ecosystems.  The komodo‚Äôs cosmos‚Äôs polkadots verus.

Why in those ecosystems?  Because they will provide developers (and organizations) an arguable order of magnitude more sovereignty and security than eth v1.0 provided in 2016-2018 which.

If there are stablecoins in those ecosystems why bother with crypto like kmd atom or dots?  Because of bridges between services, dev costs, tech debt, new opportunities and functions not supported by stablecoin provider.  The devs of stablecoin have different goals to ecosystem providers and different weaknesses/pain points.

Edit:  verus chain ecosystem

[18-Nov-19 01:22 AM] jspook16#3059
Yeah I was thinking something similar I was unable to articulate it though. Great point

[18-Nov-19 07:31 AM] Arno#3334
Is there a dedicated stable coin in the Komodo ecosystem?

[19-Nov-19 09:40 AM] zenosama#5371
Im still new in the keyword atomicDEX but as i understand its decentralized exchange+atomic swaps?

[19-Nov-19 09:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , cross chain trading no middleman or blockchain mediating

[19-Nov-19 07:04 PM] Arno#3334
Here's a question regarding the classification of the KMD currency, please correct me if my assumptions are wrong: Since there has been an ICO for the KMD coins and they have not been mined from zero supply like Bitcoin (thus pre-mined), isn't there the danger of the SEC coming after Komodo as they did with many other ICO projects, and classifying the KMD currency as an unregistered security and a fraudulent fund raise? Or is the creation and development of KMD so decentralized that there is no company or organization that can be held accountable and penalized?

[19-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Arno#3334
(like with Bitcoin?)

[19-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Arno#3334
I'm just wondering how safe we can feel in that regard.

[19-Nov-19 07:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
I would compare it with bitcoin as you described it

[19-Nov-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
we delivered on all ICO promises, have a howey letter, no corporation to date, pretty decentralized

[19-Nov-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also, all the aspects that usually make something a security is in other coins, like DEX, SUPERNET

[19-Nov-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is strictly a currency

[19-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Arno#3334
ok, thanks!

[19-Nov-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
if you notice the SEC actions, they are going after the very biggest and the most extreme of ICO that was basically a fraud. I saw some list of top crypto projects by american govt, KMD was in the top 40

[19-Nov-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the ICO that spend on marketing without a product, those are the ones that need to worry

[19-Nov-19 07:17 PM] Arno#3334
Generally it's one thing what oneself believes is so, or is true, and another thing what the SEC simply claims. Veritaseum comes to mind, which was really not a big ICO first of all, and they released a long public statement why the SEC's allegations were actually wrong, but still the SEC could claim whatever they wanted and pretend that's true.

[19-Nov-19 07:17 PM] Arno#3334
And successfully charged them.

[19-Nov-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what tech did veritaseum release?

[19-Nov-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
last i saw it was just a QT wallet

[19-Nov-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
centralized service

[19-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Arno#3334
peer to peer capital markets

[19-Nov-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
but did it actually work?

[19-Nov-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt see any decentralized tech come out of that project

[19-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Arno#3334
Yes, they are quite far already with their development, working beta.

[19-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Arno#3334
https://dapp.veritaseum.com/

[19-Nov-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
how is a website decentralized?

[19-Nov-19 07:22 PM] Arno#3334
Haha, good question. No, they are a company of course, having sold the ERC20 VERI token as "pre-paid fees for their peer-to-peer services".

[19-Nov-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you can say "peer to peer capital markets", but what does that mean in terms of tech

[19-Nov-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so they have a centralized service and the token sale was prepaid fees, for this centralized service

[19-Nov-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and they dont have any tech at the protocol level, it is just an ERC20 token

[19-Nov-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and you are thinking this is in anyway comparable to komodo?

[19-Nov-19 07:24 PM] Arno#3334
proprietary tech, in that sense, yes. A business model. No whitepaper. Reggie Middleton always compared this to: has Microsoft released a whitepaper? No, they have a business model, and created a lot of licenses for the services (here: the VERI token), that they can sell as they like (here: ICO)

[19-Nov-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810
didnt they raise $20 mil or so?

[19-Nov-19 07:25 PM] Arno#3334
I think so.

[19-Nov-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so a closed source, centrally controlled service, sold as prepaid tokens. you do realize this is about as far away from komodo as you can get

[19-Nov-19 07:25 PM] Arno#3334
yes.

[19-Nov-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo isnt a business

[19-Nov-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no business model for KMD

[19-Nov-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a coin and the ICO was done to raise BTC needed for dPoW txfees, and we finished that and started notarized within months after the ICO was finished

[19-Nov-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that as soon as we completed our ICO promises, and KMD started trading freely on the markets, it is not any security

[19-Nov-19 07:28 PM] Arno#3334
I see.

[19-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Arno#3334
I only raised it because these days it feels they're trying to come after any project they might want, potentially anything that could be a (in their view threatening) alternative to the established fiat monetary system, whether the claim is valid or not. It's simply good to be prepared for anything.

[19-Nov-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly, if they go after every project in crypto, they would have come after us too

[19-Nov-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine that we would be toward the last ones they go after, and i guess they would have to come after me as there is nobody else responsible for the ICO.

[19-Nov-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what ranking we are as far as funds raised, but likely beyond the top 200

[19-Nov-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
or even top 500 as 2017 was pretty crazy

[19-Nov-19 07:34 PM] Arno#3334
As long as you keep being able to stay anonymous, they might no be able to come after you. üòÑ

[19-Nov-19 07:35 PM] Arno#3334

Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission, No. 11-1274, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the 5-year statute of limitations applicable to SEC enforcement actions that seek financial penalties begins to accrue when the alleged violation occurs, not when the SEC discovers the violation.  This decision may have implications not only for SEC enforcement actions, but for other government proceedings seeking a civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.

it was an exciting month in 2014. hard to buy BTC to buy SuperNET. localbitcoin was the easiest option apart from mining

[20-Nov-19 12:27 AM] richardt#2807
On the topic of SuperNET, are there any plans to liquidate SuperNET and distribute everything to holders in the event that SuperNET does not produce any significant dividends in the next 2-3 years? Or possibly 5 years?

[20-Nov-19 12:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Supernet has already paid over 1 million

[20-Nov-19 12:45 AM] Dave123#3592
Are there any plans to provide liquidity for people who want to sell there Supernet or liquidate the whole thing?

[20-Nov-19 12:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No .  Eventually the rest of the assets will be on Atomicdex you can offload there when they are enabled

[20-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Dave123#3592
Only problem beeing that there never was a market for Supernet asset with liquidity and there probably wont be one on Atomicdex either.

[20-Nov-19 02:45 AM] richardt#2807
Agreed. There should be some kind of end goal.
