if the past contains a 2 million "accidental" instamine for the devs, who then reduce the coin emission significantly... well it wast a premine, it happened during the first weeks when it was still called Xcoin, so technically DASH was never premined. yet there was a large percent of existing supply that was mined by the dev

James, is a true physical bitcoin possible? One where users can trust that the coin holds a certain digital amount. Is it possible to use crypto conditions to create such a thing? For example, a meta ledger that tracks who can unlock an amount from a physical coin. A load and lock kind of mechanism. I put 5 dollars in a 5 dollar denomination coin and locked it. I now have the right to redeem it. I can pass this right to the next public wallet.

[12-Feb-19 05:58 PM] rainbro7#4735
But what if anyone can create and lock coins?

[12-Feb-19 05:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
They dont all have to look the same

[12-Feb-19 05:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
Redemption is the meta ledger tracking that you own the coins

[12-Feb-19 05:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
A DAO

[12-Feb-19 05:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
or smartcontract of sorts

[12-Feb-19 06:05 PM] rainbro7#4735
I'm not so technical. I'm just assuming fund can be sent to some type of smartcontract or DAO. They can only be redeemed if the next users public key was switch with the previous users public key (representing a transfer of ownership - like a meta ledger). Its not very efficient. I would imagine, given that you agree a central party is required, that some type of smartcontract or DAO could act as a trusted third party. I'm not sure how but if anyone could think of it it's probably james.

a onetime use privkey could be implemented with CC

[12-Feb-19 06:06 PM] rainbro7#4735
But would a onetime use private key be useful for a coin that constantly changes hands?

[12-Feb-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. put it on the inside of the coin. it requires the coin to be destroyed to reveal the privkey

[12-Feb-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is that there wont be a way to prove that it has any actual privkey inside

[12-Feb-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is as centralized as you sending a tx to someone else

[12-Feb-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the usage of the privkey is validated by the entire network

[12-Feb-19 06:08 PM] rainbro7#4735
I get what you guys are saying. There will always have to be someone with access to the private key.

[12-Feb-19 06:09 PM] rainbro7#4735
bummer :/

[12-Feb-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the validity also. the problem is to properly prove there is a privkey inside would be to have a zero knowledge RFID that proves there is a privkey to the pubkey inside

[12-Feb-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no minting here, just putting funds into a privkey

[12-Feb-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, in that sense you do need to trust the minting process doesnt reveal the privkey

[12-Feb-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is a zksnark like way to prove it has a privkey

[12-Feb-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and the only way to reveal the privkey is to destroy the coin

[12-Feb-19 06:12 PM] rainbro7#4735
I understand, so there is no optimal ways yet . Darn, I feel like this would help spread crypto.

[12-Feb-19 06:12 PM] rainbro7#4735
Cheers, thanks for the info guys.

[12-Feb-19 06:23 PM] rainbro7#4735
Yeah, it would be easy for a central party :/

Just learned about this.

[12-Feb-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
does it prevent the retention of a copy? if not, it seems not having much value

[12-Feb-19 07:33 PM] rainbro7#4735
But the person that sends the private key would know the private key. In this situation you cannot know the private key until the hardware is damaged in an irreversible way. It acts as true cash until destroyed. It is only one time use though.

[12-Feb-19 07:33 PM] rainbro7#4735
Yes, no one can create a copy since the private key cannot be found until the device is destroyed.

[12-Feb-19 07:34 PM] rainbro7#4735
The one time use (after redemption) and the cost make it not too viable.

[12-Feb-19 07:34 PM] rainbro7#4735
I think it's around 40 dollars for 3.

[12-Feb-19 08:19 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c abit of a odd question, ur here most of times. How does ur sleeping schedule look like?

[12-Feb-19 08:20 PM] Markus#5464
Not a tech question tho, sorry for that!

[12-Feb-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I sleep when I am sleepy. I eat when I am hungry. what else?

[12-Feb-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i try to avoid forcing myself to sleep if I am not sleepy, or staying awake if I am sleepy.

[12-Feb-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
coding doesnt use that many calories, so its not like physical labor where you have to stop after some hours.

[12-Feb-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
I remember a 5 day stretch where I slept a total of about 10 hours in just a short nap here and there

[12-Feb-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes I sleep for 16hrs, maybe after the 5 day stretch i would sleep for 24+ hours, dont remember

@jl777c Hi, I was just thinking so for atomic swaps, where will the prices exchanges of the 2 parties like 1 BTC = ?? ETH? Is there a service in BarterDEX that is having that exchange rates?

[13-Feb-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
each party puts in the price they want

[13-Feb-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
its called a market

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, so everything on that side is implemented in SuperNET right?

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a p2p

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
each person would put in the price they want and it is used to determine if a swap should happen or not

[13-Feb-19 06:33 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So is it connecting to different blockchain's like Eth, Btc, and others?

[13-Feb-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, to hundreds

[13-Feb-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but only if you specify that

[13-Feb-19 06:36 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
SuperNET is implements that right? BarterDex backend is SuperNET?
Just curious though, since my prof told me that BarterDex has same concept as Bisq? but Bisq is not doing atomic swaps right?

[13-Feb-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET repo is where mm1 is. I think Bisq is doing human arbitrated swaps, maybe same high level concept, but totally different implementation

[13-Feb-19 07:02 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
mm1 -> marketmaker right?

[13-Feb-19 07:02 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
mm1 is connecting to the different blockchain nodes right?

[13-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a new iteration mm2, that does the same stuff, just better

[13-Feb-19 07:07 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay thanks for this information.

[13-Feb-19 07:10 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Sorry I am kinda lost on the CC part, so I notice in the Komodo repo, there is a CC source, so if I add a new CC like CC_VOTE, will this mean it will create a OP_VOTE opcode and add on the UTXO?

[13-Feb-19 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[13-Feb-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if you make a CC_VOTE, there will be a new CC evalcode of CC_VOTE

[13-Feb-19 07:12 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So CC_VOTE is the contract itself?

[13-Feb-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
you can put it in the libcc.so and make a user defined evalcode. look at ~/komodo/src/cc/cclib.cpp

[13-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the code that validates VOTE evalcode is the "contract"

[13-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so whenever a VOTE utxo is spent, the code associated with the CC_VOTE is invoked and it can do whatever (literally) it needs to in order to say true or false

Is `createFunding` a function if we want to make a Dice contract?

[13-Feb-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the way dice CC was designed, there needs to be "house" funds to bet against. without any such funds, you really cant bet against the house

[13-Feb-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so the first step is to fund the dice plan

[13-Feb-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
by doing various transactions you advance the state and achieve the desired effects

[13-Feb-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
CC are quite a bit different than anything else, so you do need to study the existing examples to see how they achieve their goals

[13-Feb-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
faucet CC is one of the simpler ones

[13-Feb-19 07:25 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay thanks @jl777c , I was comparing it to Solidity for my paper, since in Solidity you just create a smart contract(based on the language syntax) and run it, in CC I am confused on why it has a implementation in core code and how would a finished contract look like

[13-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC run natively at full speed with total access to all daemon data

[13-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is like the difference between CPU mining and ASIC

[13-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is more work to make an ASIC, but the result is orders of magnitude more efficient

[13-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is NOT equivalent to solidity

[13-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact, theoretically it is possible to make a single solidity CC that would interpret solidity contracts

[13-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
CC are able to change consensus rules for the blockchain

[13-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
solidity runs an interpreted language under existing consensus rules

[13-Feb-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
once a CC exists, you interact with it by sending CC transactions

[13-Feb-19 07:29 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
> in fact, theoretically it is possible to make a single solidity CC that would interpret solidity contracts
So basically, if this would be possible we can apply use solidity in creating contracts for KMD?

[13-Feb-19 07:31 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
so `faucet.cpp` is the contract at this point?

[13-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, once such a CC exists, that would be possible. but considering that we can get things like rogue CC working in a couple weeks there isnt  much need for solidity. also it would be 10x to 100x slower and possibly not viable for any compute intensive things

[13-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we shouldnt use the word "contract", smart or otherwise

[13-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is a TOTALLY different way of solving the same problem

[13-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it implements constrained transactions with a specific vout type

[13-Feb-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
and using this, one of the nearly infinite things you can do, is implement what are commonly known as "smart contracts", you could create a smart contract interpreter, you could make a blockchain enforced sudoku too

[13-Feb-19 07:35 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow that's really great! There is a current doc on running CCs right? I just wan to try it maybe on testnet or something. I can't really understand completely without trying it.

[13-Feb-19 07:37 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So every addition/modification of the CC you have to rebuild `komodod` and publish daemon updates with new CCs right?

[13-Feb-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
there is the libcc.so, which is a dynamic library to make user defined CC

[13-Feb-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt quite building right, but when it is you can just update libcc.so and komodod would use it

[13-Feb-19 07:39 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow! got so excited to use this, this might be boosting my paper.

[13-Feb-19 07:39 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
This needs testnet funds to run the conditions right?

[13-Feb-19 07:40 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I mean CC

[13-Feb-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
just normal txfee of 0.0001

[13-Feb-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
its just normal tx as far as the rest of the blockchain is concerned

[13-Feb-19 07:43 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So the CC are executed with an RPC call?

[13-Feb-19 07:54 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
```Each Crypto-Conditions contract has its own special address that is known to all, including its private key.```

[13-Feb-19 07:55 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
This is a different privkey right?

globally known privkeys allows funds to be locked in an address and then depending on the rules of the CC to be unlocked by potentially anybody. If possible it is better to not use such as there is only CC validation protecting the funds, but sometimes that is exactly what you need.
