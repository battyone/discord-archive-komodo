how much has it reduced?

[01-May-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont track it

[01-May-19 10:56 AM] artik123#2884
it's just less contributions per day than it used to be

[01-May-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you will find most of those are just merges of PR from others

[01-May-19 10:59 AM] artik123#2884

Supernet has over 7 million KMD now. I like. Did you do some recent trades to get it there?

[02-May-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i had the chance to swap the rest of WAVES, not at as good a price, but still seemed like a good idea

[02-May-19 04:31 PM] allbits#5898
Nice!

[02-May-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing against WAVES, just KMD seems to have a lot more upside

[02-May-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
I should have swapped it all when WAVES was higher, but took a while to find a willing counterparty, and only when the price was better, so I guess i didnt have much choice

tl;dr; when tx that is needed for use case, restart chain with -ac_earlytxid 

Hi James,
In your chicken and egg post [1] are you saying that at chain setup within the 100blocks to create the early tx. Then restart setting -ac_earlytxid when completed (within the 100 blocks)?

[06-May-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is -earlytxid NOT -ac_earlytxid as it is not an option that affects the chain parameters

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to make all the special txids in the first 100 blocks and relaunch all nodes

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking you would launch the chain, mine a few blocks. STOP mining

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
submit the special tx

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
start mining

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
get the txid, stop mining

[06-May-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
start with -earlytxid=<txid>

[06-May-19 04:54 PM] Mylo#8306
understood, thanks

Hello. Is the BarterDEX site unavailable at this time?

[08-May-19 03:44 AM] Micah68#5652
It seems to have been unavailable since a little after 7:00 PM Central Time (US).

[08-May-19 04:02 AM] Micah68#5652
@Deleted User  https://explorer.myhush.org/address/RFZxRtLkHxTfpoa6EYaeUYNewCvr7MYU7c  I'm not sure if this is what your asking for.   I'm trying to open up BarterDEX version 1.1.3-rc1  and after a rather long time of sitting on the clock after entering the pass phrase, it eventually opened up just now.  But, I've been successfully sending HUSH3 (aka mining to it) for several days. I'm wondering if that explains anything. In the last hour, I've  changed wallett addresses and  now send  mining to the Agama wallet address.

[08-May-19 05:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Spv server probably just was down.  BarterDEX GUI is being deprecated in the not too distant future .  Use agama for now

[08-May-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is built on ETH, then it seems it is just for tracking the token, i would assume very loose integration

[08-May-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
like many places claim to be a DEX when it is just a proxy based thing

It was never intended to carry professional miners through the future

with KMD there will always be at least 1 KMD block reward and even if there are only notaries mining, that is ok

[13-May-19 01:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Core fans think that people will willingly pay BTC fees in order of 1000 Usd to use the base layer for settlement (in fact they're looking forward to it in their plans, the so called fee-market), while most common users will only ever use the Ligthing Network or other 2nd layers. So miners will have a lot of fee income even with blocksize capped. I think that's utter nonsense tbh

https://blocknet.co/the-evolution-of-the-decentralized-exchange-a-brief-history/ mentioned KMD "The aforementioned Komodo platform offered many great innovations such as private transactions, side chains and more, but was still a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù solution and not built on a protocol. Billing themselves as the ‚Äúplatform of platforms‚Äù, developers were restricted to using the Komodo platform only. This could be very limiting as it is an enforcement of a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach, which is a barrier to potential innovation. By this time, Komodo had also begun utilizing an (unrecognized) atomic swap process on its own DEX, Barterdex, but they use a partially centralized order matching system for buy and sell orders that is similar to Waves and also feature centralized Electrum servers in the trading process itself which ultimately increases risk and reduces decentralization. Since Bartedex was not built on a protocol geared specifically towards decentralized exchange and the Komodo system requires nodes to back up the Komodo Blockchain every 10 minutes into the KMD chain and then into the BTC chain, this ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù system may cause scaling issues in the future as this process may cause blockchain bloat due to the limitations of the BTC block, which is also about 10 minutes or 1MB per block."
