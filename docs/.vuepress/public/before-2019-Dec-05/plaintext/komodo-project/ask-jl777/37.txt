all the notaries are running a full node and they need to reach consensus as to the (height + blockhash)

[08-Dec-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
since we have a chain A notarization after the third block, that means chain B is dead to the notaries and from the above discussion we see that a node wont switch from notarized to non-notarized

[08-Dec-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so the notaries wont switch to chain B and thus cant reach consensus for the chain B notarization

[08-Dec-18 06:53 PM] sgp#7572
by they need to reach consensus", are you referring to all the notary nodes or the 13 nodes?

[08-Dec-18 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
all the notary nodes reach consensus and 13 of them sign

[08-Dec-18 06:55 PM] sgp#7572
can you speak more about the consensus process where they all get on the same page?

[08-Dec-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
for a given notarization, the notaries are numbered from 0 to 63, the one that is 0 changes each notarization to give each notary equal chance over time to participate in notarization.

[08-Dec-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
now all 64 nodes broadcast to each other their notarization data

[08-Dec-18 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
along with the info they got from the other notary nodes

[08-Dec-18 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
based on this, nodes propose the 13 signers for this round such that all of them are in agreement.

[08-Dec-18 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
at first there is maybe not so many nodes that agree on all details

[08-Dec-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but the proposal with the most support is switched to by notaries that are not already there, so after several rounds things converge so that we get 13 nodes all in agreement

[08-Dec-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then this is latched and the 13 nodes generate signatures, broadcast them

[08-Dec-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes reconstruct the 13 way signed tx and broadcast it

[08-Dec-18 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is actually quite a process and took a while to get it efficient with a high completion rate

[08-Dec-18 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries are tuning their systems to maximize the number of notarizations they participate in and you can ask them about the randomness, it is not possible to know ahead of time which 13 nodes the group will converge to

[08-Dec-18 07:02 PM] sgp#7572
so if even 1 node disagrees on the notarization, they can't notarize anything?

[08-Dec-18 07:02 PM] sgp#7572
actually wait let me think more

[08-Dec-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it is resistant to a single node disagreeing

[08-Dec-18 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes can make proposals for the selected 13

[08-Dec-18 07:06 PM] sgp#7572
all right, so of the 64, 13 are selected who get to make decisions. all nodes propose blocks to notarize. do you need all 13 people to agree for a proposed block to be notarized?

[08-Dec-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Dec-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is the 64 as a group that decides

[08-Dec-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a LOT of possible 13 signers of 64, mathematically 13 choose 64

[08-Dec-18 07:08 PM] sgp#7572
what do the 64 as a group decide?

[08-Dec-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so a deterministic algo is used to reduce the selected 13 for each notarization round, but still there are thousands of possible 13

[08-Dec-18 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
a 64 bit number is used as a bitmask to denote the chose 13

[08-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the requirement is that it starts from the current iterations node 0

[08-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
must have 13 bits set

[08-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and each node in the bitmask must have the identical data

[08-Dec-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so this bitmask cant be created until several iterations of comms between all the nodes

[08-Dec-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
then nodes start proposing the mask to use

[08-Dec-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes tally what the other nodes see and determine which is most popular

[08-Dec-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
they then switch if they are not already using the most popular mask

[08-Dec-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
critical is that all 13 signers agree on the mask, as if the other nodes select a bitmask, but any of the 13 are not also in agreement, it wont sign it and the notarization wont work

[08-Dec-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is somewhat similar to mining, randomized and hard to predict which 13 "win"

[08-Dec-18 07:17 PM] sgp#7572
yes, the 64 have a process for randomly selecting the 13. and if even 1 of the 13 disagrees, then it does not get approved

[08-Dec-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
over the years, the algo was improved to select the 13 that are all in agreement

[08-Dec-18 07:17 PM] sgp#7572
is there some sort of time-out process? what if 1 node disagrees with everything in perpetuity? can the 64 nodes select 13 other random nodes?

[08-Dec-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i must not have explained clearly...

[08-Dec-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not about 1 node agreeing or not

[08-Dec-18 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes broadcast to all other nodes what it things should be the 13, also it broadcasts what the other nodes sent to it

[08-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so all the nodes can see what they get directly and also what the other nodes are seeing

[08-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
given that, they are able to select the 13 who are in agreement

[08-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and converge to the 13

[08-Dec-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if a node doesnt agree, and doesnt shift to the winning 13 bitmask, it is just ignored

[08-Dec-18 07:19 PM] sgp#7572
ok, makes more sense thank you

[08-Dec-18 07:20 PM] sgp#7572
you always select 13 nodes that are in agreement

[08-Dec-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the group does

[08-Dec-18 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
using what is basiscally a decentralized process, even if only 64 nodes

[08-Dec-18 07:21 PM] sgp#7572
suppose there are two factions, each with 30 nodes, that are in disagreement. how would the selection process work?

[08-Dec-18 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
in a chain split scenario, consensus is not reached

[08-Dec-18 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
13 out of 64 does not sound like a giant percentage, but if there is any significant disagreement, the notaries wont be able to settle on a bitmask for 13, with all 13 signers agreeing to it

[08-Dec-18 07:24 PM] sgp#7572
how many nodes need to be in disagreement for them not to agree on selecting the 13 nodes?

[08-Dec-18 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
there is not exact threshold, but I estimate approx one quarter to one third

[08-Dec-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
you have to understand that unless there is a chainsplit, there is agreement on all nodes

[08-Dec-18 07:28 PM] sgp#7572
yes, but that's sort of like a statement like "there is no disagreement if everyone agrees." I'm trying to predict attacks that could happen if people disagree. Thanks for answering my questions so far. I will think more about the situation and get back to you if I have any other questions

[08-Dec-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
to create disagreement, the chain needs to be split

[08-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are mining in private, then none of the notaries would have that chain, so it needs to be broadcast, but if it is broadcast then it is subject to the notarization rules

[08-Dec-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess if an attacker starts mining from the last notarization and propagates it to many nodes, well if they do that, it becomes the mainchain and gets notarized

[08-Dec-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
basically everything needs to be working properly for notarizations to happen. the notary operators can attest to this. so absence of notarization is a good signal that some sort of blockchain event is happening

[08-Dec-18 07:43 PM] sgp#7572
one last question: let's assume the unlikely event of 100% notary collusion. would they be able to notarize chain B as shown in figure 2, and if so, would nodes on chain A reog to chain B?

[08-Dec-18 07:53 PM] sgp#7572
yes, exactly

[08-Dec-18 07:54 PM] sgp#7572
I want to know what other nodes would do in that scenario

[08-Dec-18 07:57 PM] sgp#7572
would the process of switching to chain B from A be automatic?

[08-Dec-18 08:00 PM] sgp#7572
it seems to me that it would depend on how the code was written. if it's written for a node to never reorg past the last notarized block it has in its cache, then it would have to be manual. but if it's written for a node to never reorg past the latest notarized block it can find, then it could be automatic as it finds the latest one on the other chain

[08-Dec-18 08:01 PM] sgp#7572
I'm reading the logs now

[08-Dec-18 08:04 PM] sgp#7572
from what I can tell, the answer was to a different scenario

[08-Dec-18 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if the chain B is the real chain and becomes much longer than chain A, then nodes will switch automatically

[08-Dec-18 08:05 PM] sgp#7572
even if chain A has a valid notarization after the split point?

[08-Dec-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean for new nodes.

[08-Dec-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if a node got the chain A notarization, then they are stuck onthat chain until they invalidateblock the one with the notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:06 PM] sgp#7572
so that would require a manual pop process

{Reactions}
ðŸ’¯ 

[08-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
usually a resync wont be needed, just to invalidate the chain A notarization, but that is up to each node

[08-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so any attempt to switch the main chain from A to B via notarizing B, this is a very noticeable process

[08-Dec-18 08:07 PM] sgp#7572
I understand it is very noticeable

[08-Dec-18 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and there would need to be overall consensus on which chain it is the correct chain

[08-Dec-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
trying to get a double spend through via this mechanism is not very practical. it would be much easier to 51% attack a non-notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
my claim is that dPoW isnt perfect, but it sure is better than without having dPoW for a chain without a large hashrate

[08-Dec-18 08:14 PM] sgp#7572
yeah, but it by no means lives up to KMD's marketing that it has the security of KMD+BTC. In our discussions these past two days, we've talked about limitations where the attacker doesn't touch BTC at all. I plan to make another writeup that more clearly indicates the situations that can occur and what the possible damages are. I appreciate your time

[08-Dec-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarynodes are validating to BTC

[08-Dec-18 08:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And the consensus of the protected chain

[08-Dec-18 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
sgps point is that if the notaries collude they can create confusion

[08-Dec-18 08:22 PM] sgp#7572
even without notary collusion, a 51% attack with the longest chain would create confusion for nodes

[08-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
even without notarization, a 51% attack can cause confusion AND double spends

[08-Dec-18 08:23 PM] sgp#7572
and with notary collusion, they could notarize a different chain, contradicting their previous notarizations

[08-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the evil notaries can 51% attack a chain easier than if it is a notarized chain

[08-Dec-18 08:24 PM] sgp#7572
yes, a 51% can create double spends even without notary collusion for dPoW. That;'s the main point I'm trying to get across

[08-Dec-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean a chain without dPoW

[08-Dec-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you have not shown any case where a double spend can happen on a dPoW chain

[08-Dec-18 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and just because you repeat that over and over, does not make it true

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] sgp#7572
this is exactly what figures 1 and 2 show the opportunity for

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just do the attack if you can

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
where is the double spend?

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] sgp#7572
figure 1 shows you can convince the network to use a different chain, even before the point of last notarization

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] sgp#7572
figure 2 shows you can convince the network also, but with added notary node collusion

[08-Dec-18 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you can convince a node that didnt see the notarized chain that there is chain B

[08-Dec-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, it cant be double spent

[08-Dec-18 08:26 PM] sgp#7572
if they resync, that's not true

[08-Dec-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if they resync, chain A wins
