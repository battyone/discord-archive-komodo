@grewalsatinder can you further elaborate on what results from having Komodo work on a RISCV board? You could expand the tweet or write a blog post. For me it's quite obscure topic and probably for most other people too

[06-Dec-18 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
CPU
there is not other CPU in industry which is open source. At least don't know any other open source CPU than this RISC-V

[06-Dec-18 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is what is exciting

[06-Dec-18 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And since CPU like RISC-V is open source I expect there will not be mess like other CPUs
The security mess there is. For almost all CPUs.

[06-Dec-18 09:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
RISC-V board is like a raspberry pi
It is less powerful than desktop but at least it is a start.

So it‚Äôs to my understanding that KMD hasn‚Äôt spend much of really any money on marketing yet. When will the true marketing campaign for the komodo platform start? What is the final thing that needs to be accomplished before the team starts truly marketing itself. I understand we‚Äôre still building now, so I don‚Äôt expect anything yet..

@grewalsatinder  Those things look really interesting, saw a video about them, they also have open source FPGA's and custom chips you can build on  website and then order ... While they are not as fast as x86 based cores right now, the ability to easily offload complex instructions to FPGA's and create your own instructions pretty easily will mean that once people start using them and open sourceing the code things will take off very fast. Really one of the greatest things that has happened in a long while to Open Source space.

guys i love komodo and i had an idea about how to spread the love, with a partnership with a great company for a great product used by thousands of people in the world Hasbro inc. and in particular to use the erc20-like capability of komodo for one, or more, of the collectible card games they manage, i know one of them would be very great in this "Magic the Gathering" the cards have a value on the market and some are very expensive  so  having them on the blockchain would be a great thing

@crumb always worth reaching out to coindesk journos.  I have a feeling there are many contract journos that use crypto media as a stepping stone to their next gig in tech journalism.  So on their next gig at least they may remember Komodo in the future....?

[11-Dec-18 10:00 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah i agree @Mylo , it's always good to make people aware of Komodo and dPoW, even if they don't give us a mention. Ive been doing a lot of PR outreach lately and haven't gotten a huge response but really the value is in slowly putting Komodo on people's radars. Eventually everyone will know is and what we do. Thanks for tweeting at that writer @crumb

what i like about this guy and why i bothered to send him a tweet, is that he is more that just a typical crypto journalist. he is an advisor to MIT MediaLabs digital currency initiative and also frequent speaker at different crypto and tech events.
best case scenario would be for him to start mentioning Komodo as one of the solutions (perhaps THE solution) to 51% attacks @Daniel CP @Mylo

@FishyGuts  does the new WP plugin allow vendors accept other ecosystem coins, maybe VRSC or OOT or ARRR?

[14-Dec-18 07:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The reason I ask is that KMD is already available with CoinPayments, which holds something like 1000 different coins and tokens and is available for woo commerce, magneto, and a few other e payment platforms

[14-Dec-18 07:46 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just trying to figure out what a good unique selling point would be for the new plugin

[14-Dec-18 08:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The plugin was developed solely for KMD by the dev who is going to do the Pirate plugin.
Does coinpayments have any fees or additional requirements for clients/users?
This is a plugin that anyone can install in any wordpress site to accept KMD.  It's already been approved by wordpress and can be used anytime.
@Daniel CP

[14-Dec-18 08:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He could make other asset chain plugins fairly easy at this point I am certain and would be glad to get him to help any ecosystem devs who might want something like this.

[14-Dec-18 08:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The largest hurdle was linking wallets as Agama doesn't have a native option to create a master private key for the plugin to reference.
