`given ETH's history to hard fork to take custody of funds from a hacker?`
Even as much as I historically despise the fact that that did happen, the probability that it could ever happen again is infinitesimal

Suppose a popular smart contract wallet that a large portion of the ETH community uses gets hacked. This could be reverted by reverting all chain activity since the hack and doing a DAO-style HF to recover the funds. How much ETH must be at stake for you to support this?

imo, it would be a nightmare to implement under the best of conditions now, even with consensus

Hello @ello

[06-Nov-19 11:06 PM] nickshop#2731
I recently logged in to my agama wallet and found that my kmds were gone, after doing some research, I found out that my funds were transferred to the dev team's safe wallet RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF  on 6/5.  I submitted the request to have my kmds transferred to a new wallet yesterday. does anyone know how long it'll take to get my coins back?

[06-Nov-19 11:38 PM] SHossain#0007
@nickshop you might receive it on the next batch which might be a week or two. don't worry, your funds are safe. you have completed all the steps for the claim. it might even be returned earlier. i'll remove your similar message from other channel.

[07-Nov-19 12:37 AM] nickshop#2731
thank you!

Keep an eye on old wallet, if someone sent you a small amount, send to new address to confirm you are owner of old addr

And i gotta say i loved it.

[07-Nov-19 11:44 AM] Adams#9563
This is the type of content / platform we would love our community to learn from.

[07-Nov-19 11:44 AM] Adams#9563
With that being said I am quite interested to know if Komodo has any future plans of expanding to Africa.

Komodo had its first meetup on the continent of Africa! 

It was organized by a group of students on the Kampala International University in Uganda.

We would love to have a similar engagement here in Nairobi Kenya as well .

[07-Nov-19 12:47 PM] Adams#9563
Also we would love to add Komodo on our course outline for study

[07-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Adams#9563
Probably you guys can provide the content and help interested parties to have a swift process of learning.

[07-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Audo#5667
Hey, yeah that was part of our meetup campaign ‚Äì but it is now over. Maybe we will have another one in the future. Of  course everyone is welcome to make Komodo meetups at any time and we are always ready to join calls and give interviews.

If someone wants to become a Komodo ambassador they can leave an application here: https://forms.monday.com/forms/a88c2459f9a5b716db778415e11cc18f

We are always looking for knowledgeable individuals who know Komodo technology, their local area, and has connections to the local blockchain space. Ambassador work is largely volunteer based though.

[07-Nov-19 01:00 PM] Adams#9563
Education is our very 1st priority. . However we are not planning to individualize the company that is CryptoCurrency Academy, what we can do is present our community members with the opportunity to study and become Komodo ambassadors.

Not sure we have a more succinct white paper, or even a specific slick sheet to pass along to exchanges or other investors/businesses, but it would be good to include that in the email

[10-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean, the website already has a TON of information in a great layout, but a single pager (or 2) might be a good idea as well since they are likely going to be going through a lot of different emails and information. Slick sheet to hook them in

Question, i assume its because the algo to make it quantum resistant is interchangeable?

[10-Nov-19 10:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A new cc module would probably have to be coded

[10-Nov-19 10:38 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically, we can't definitively say anything is quantum resistant as there aren't any quantum computers to actually test it against. We know how quantum computers will solve problems, and can then use problems to create public and private keys that aren't easy for them to solve. NIST accepts QR proposals, but can't claim any are secure for sure until we have a QC to test them against. Dilithium module, if I remember right, requires two signatures to spend, one which is your typical signature like Bitcoin and Komodo, the other is a signature created with a problem that is presumed to be difficult for a QC to solve (I believe Dilithium Crystals is Lattice based). So both signatures are used.
