How is everyone?

[04-Jul-18 09:03 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
good morning

[04-Jul-18 09:04 AM] bogybogy#3962
I will need some help from komodo team ,I look to host meet ups in London every month and because i believe in Komodo project I would like to promote Komodo to London community

[04-Jul-18 09:05 AM] bogybogy#3962
Teach people and make them to understand why is important to use  decentralised ecosystem blockchain

[04-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Sounds great!

[04-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Daniel CP#2020
What kind of help are you looking for?

[04-Jul-18 10:25 AM] bogybogy#3962
We look to have a guest from komodo community or platform who can explain the technology behind the komodo platform

[04-Jul-18 10:31 AM] bogybogy#3962
IBM doesn't need support from community,they got customers but behind Komodo platform we got ideology of decentralized Blockchain Ecosystem,where at the moment people misunderstood the concept of  blockchain

[04-Jul-18 10:32 AM] bogybogy#3962
We are not expert in blockchain but we learn.

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] bogybogy#3962
No worries,I will appreciate the support from anyone ,we don't look for fame,money or to be sponsored just to show to crypto community whats mean in reality Blockchain ,big  companies and governments mislead the purpose of Blockchain  technology and see only their own interest

[04-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I see. We have a couple guys in UK, maybe one of them would be willing to come speak once the meetings are established and have a bit of a crowd

[04-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Daniel CP#2020
In the meantime, we can def provide info and support if you'd like to learn more about Komodo and tell other folks about us

[04-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Senda#7983
Hi, I've seen a discussion on Pepedapp (a collectible dapp in the ethereum network) about komodo and changing its dapp to the komodo blockchain
I copied the conversation into a file but I can not upload it to this discord channel
Senda 
they have doubts about komodo smart contracts, some say they are not well tested
all this comes from the problems of congestion and high gas prices that the ethereum network is having
They also have doubts about how they could change the cards already created, it seems they see it complicated

If someone wants to see the conversation or tell me a link where they can find the best information, let me know, thank you

[04-Jul-18 06:59 PM] charlesrocket#6246
hi ‚úå  we could one find the information regarding dPoW partnership?)

[04-Jul-18 07:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Senda do you have a link to this conversation? afaik Komodo smart contracts are still in testing

[04-Jul-18 07:55 PM] Audo#5667
At the moment we have no fulll smart contract capability. We are developing/testing cross-chain simple contracts.

@charlesrocket I am not sure where you refer with 'dPoW partnership'

[04-Jul-18 08:16 PM] charlesrocket#6246
@Audo this is regarding off-chain backups over kmd

[04-Jul-18 08:17 PM] charlesrocket#6246
like what game credits recently rolled out

[04-Jul-18 08:18 PM] charlesrocket#6246
got a reply from Ben over marketing email, so guess that question can be closed here, sorry

[04-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Audo#5667
ok, great üëç

yeah we provide that service, and game credits is using it

[04-Jul-18 08:30 PM] charlesrocket#6246
yes, thats the one) finally found some time to really read the paper

[04-Jul-18 08:30 PM] charlesrocket#6246
very nice solution, great timing

[04-Jul-18 08:31 PM] charlesrocket#6246
glad to see kmd's growth, so many great things developed in last couple years

[05-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Regnar#6164
I've got an idea, though I'm not versed in the specifics of dPoW enough to do this solo, but this website that calculates the costs of 51% attacks on specific coins on Nicehash. What if we could make our own version of this list and show how dPoW can actually decrease the potential gains from hacking each coin. https://www.crypto51.app/

[05-Jul-18 02:05 AM] Regnar#6164
iirc 51% attacks occur when an adversarial miner creates a silent chain of conflicting transactions, multiple blocks of which, and on the current chain sends a transaction to an exchange or something, it is confirmed, they trade and pull their coins from the exchange, and then release their longer, silent chain, and begin mining that new chain so it becomes the legit chain, except all their transactions are erased.

[05-Jul-18 02:07 AM] Regnar#6164
hacker keeps the newly traded coins, and the coins used to trade for them. so dPoW with a notary every 10 minutes limits the upside potential for a hacker to silently mine multiple blocks (or only up to the most recent notarization)

[05-Jul-18 02:07 AM] Regnar#6164
Is there a good way to quantify this with this data from the site?

[05-Jul-18 02:19 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure there's really a good way to quantify it. I feel like the best strategy for an exchange to not get ripped off is wait for a notarization or two. so if there are silent chains they would have to be between notarizations, and as soon as a new notarization is added all their silently mined blocks aren't good anymore. Just trying to figure out how to quantify it in dollars.

[05-Jul-18 02:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hard to do, but yes, exchanges just have to wait for a notarization, then any chain mined back past that notarization will not be valid and the deposit to the exchange would be valid.

[05-Jul-18 04:03 AM] Regnar#6164
^that's what I figured, it'd be tough to quantify that. Though I assume a coin could notarize more frequently on the Komodo blockchain if they wanted an even shorter time frame (<10 minutes) to be vulnerable for attacks (hackers would have to beat Komodo and the notary nodes too) and then notarized to BTC after.

[05-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Regnar#6164
I can't even take previous attacks and reduce the amount by what could have been done in 10 minutes, because the whole attack was likely done at once. so it either happens, or it doesn't.

[05-Jul-18 04:39 AM] RAE#3178
@blackjok3r Saw a post where you mentioned flying back to Perth...do you live in Western Australia?

I think the micro bounties will help. Little competitions for a few free coins motivate people to keep eyes on, but need some stuff which luddites can be in the running for too. Someone mentioned a "pick the peak" comp for the scaling test for example.

stuff Like this i guess lol

[06-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Regnar#6164
Anyone else think that the dPoW explanation hasn't quite hit the mark in how it is effective against 51% attacks?

[06-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I feel we jump to saying, notarized on the BTC blockchain, but don't really ever get into detail with how exactly that works in defense of 51% attacks. sure we say if you want to make a change to the notarized blocks, you have to change btc too. but I was thinking it would be effective to show how an attack works in process, and how the notarization essentially cuts off all the past blocks that were silently mined with double spends ready to be broadcasted.

[06-Jul-18 03:49 AM] Regnar#6164
for instance when a hacker is mining a silent chain and hasn't broadcast it yet, they are say, one block longer than the main chain. So say they have 11 blocks mined and the main chain has 10, and have their double spend transactions already in place throughout the 11 blocks. but when the main chain notarizes the past 10 blocks to BTC. the hacker is no longer able to use the first 10 blocks they mined, and none of the double spends that were mined in there will work because when they broadcast the 11 blocks as the longest chain, the notarization will not match the one on BTC. so the hacker is stuck working on the 11th and on block and must perform their attack in the time period between the last notarization and the next notarization, which depending on how quickly the notary from an asset chain gets on KMD (and then later to BTC) could make it very difficult, and expensive as they would lose money renting mining power for all the no longer effective 10 blocks.

[06-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
From what Ive seen most people dont even understand the basics üòÇ I think what most people are worried about is how "new" or "unproven" this is, though they don't understand or neccessarily want to understand.
I think the best way for mass marketing would be to find a few more other chains, preferably a top 50 coin or one that people have heard of, though I'm sure that will eventually happen in time once the team has solved all the small kinks and made the procedure a lot easier.

Another main thing to focus on would be to emphasize how it is not centralized, and how notaries cannot collude to launch their own attack. From my postings, most people seem to think that notaries are centralized and that coins hand over control to kmd/notaries if they wish to use dPoW which is far from the truth

[06-Jul-18 06:56 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar yes, that's a great idea! Ben and I were actually talking about that just yesterday. We're planning on writing a separate post about 51% attacks, how they work, and how dPoW prevents them
