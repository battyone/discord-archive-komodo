in any case, nothing stops anybody from doing things if they dont cost money

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
why dont you do it?

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891

[24-May-19 05:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Damn near daily

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Nevermind man

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so its your fault it isnt marketed right?

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
countdown only works for "when moon crowd" . Not really the crowd we want , do we?

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you say it doesnt cost money, and you were doing it, but you complain of lack of results

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Ok dude I‚Äôm done with this shit I suppose

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so which is it?

[24-May-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
does it take money after all?

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
bear market made all the coins go down

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and all the money spent on hype pretty worthless

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Have a good one man. Wish you the best

[24-May-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I am not going to by hyping, as hype means to exaggerate and make unsupportable claims

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not what komodo is about

[24-May-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i cant stop others from doing things, but please dont ask me to start lying to the public, just to pump up the price

In this thread, bagholder doesnt care about your project or the tech you are working hard on, he just wants you to sell out your reputation  and bullshit so that he can sell your coin for more than he paid for it.

[24-May-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
we could improve our marketing and it is getting better, year by year. but without large amounts of advertising, it is very hard to get large scale exposure

[24-May-19 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of projects simply spend money to get users, a form of advertising

[24-May-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway asking a C programmer to become a huckster... its just not me

[24-May-19 05:47 PM] joe2x4#5987
Conversely, what marketing did Komodo do to warrant such a rise to $12

[24-May-19 05:47 PM] joe2x4#5987
Magic?

[24-May-19 05:49 PM] joe2x4#5987
The best way anyone can help out KMD price is to support the projects and businesses in the ecosystem. Make those projects look really shiney. People will naturally come. With 1000 projects we get 1000 devs.

[24-May-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
our CMC rank didnt change that much, all cryptos went to high levels during bull market

[24-May-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
granted for a day or 2 we were in top 20

[24-May-19 06:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We do need to get out in the public more when the new imagery is out.   Part of the problems we have with ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù is the divide between team and community,  public will defer responsibility when they can but need to realize they too are integral are getting the word out  .  A community based price pressure cooker would help to galvanize community efforts I think .

[24-May-19 06:10 PM] Lennart#9331
i always thought the bear market would kill the hype coins and that it would be the chance for high quality coins to naturally float up higher on the CMC.. But now, with the bear market apparently over, hype coin shit seems to be stronger than ever üòî

[24-May-19 06:11 PM] Lennart#9331
I am so surprised that even youtube people like Ivan On Tech or the likes, where you think they are there to teach people what is really going on strong in the space, almost never touches on KMD

[24-May-19 06:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
bear market didnt kill any shit, it only killed some good old coins that have no marketing

[24-May-19 06:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just wait til  the next btc moonshot,  altcoin markets will be bled

[24-May-19 06:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
it killed old fairly launched community coins with no funds.   ICO scams had money to keep going

[24-May-19 06:12 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so sad

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
altcoin markets have already been bled about as much as is possible

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not yet

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] Lennart#9331
disappointing. and that is for both sides, when you're mainly here to support a good project and also when you just invest and wait for a moonshot

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
ivan is paid placement

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] Lennart#9331
and for devs as well, disappointing no? seeing the TRON there in Top10?

[24-May-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
why would he promote for free when he can get paid

[24-May-19 06:14 PM] Lennart#9331
yeah i hate it. he makes it seem that he is "the good guy"

[24-May-19 06:14 PM] Lennart#9331
the name "ivan ON TECH"

[24-May-19 06:14 PM] Lennart#9331
pffff

[24-May-19 06:15 PM] Lennart#9331
sorry for my rant üôÑ

[24-May-19 06:15 PM] Lennart#9331
someone like him should be paid naturally through youtube clicks from people, that are looking for quality videos - unbiased

[24-May-19 06:19 PM] Lennart#9331
I'll try to educate the german folks more in different media, all i can do

[24-May-19 06:19 PM] Lennart#9331
we as a community must not stop commenting on youtube and twitter..

[24-May-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
high volume youtoubers also get paid from youtube

[24-May-19 06:19 PM] Lennart#9331
mentioning KMD but not spamming

[24-May-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
in addition to whatever they can charge

[24-May-19 06:20 PM] Lennart#9331
you basically never know if what they're talking about is paid ads or not

[24-May-19 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
assume they are being directly paid or otherwise directly benefiting from talking about *anything*

[24-May-19 06:24 PM] jorian#4555
mentioning KMD at some youtube show isn't going to get us somewhere.

[24-May-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
if komodo is really onto enabling developers and businesses to create blockchains, we should make it as easy as possible to do so

[24-May-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
with tools and guides etc.

[24-May-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
i think we're well on our way

[24-May-19 06:25 PM] jorian#4555
but KMD and its price isn't a good representation of the progress

[24-May-19 06:26 PM] Alexfrog#1338
the "marketing" komodo needs is to convince more projects to use KMD instead of Eth/whatever

[24-May-19 06:27 PM] Lennart#9331
yeah

[24-May-19 06:27 PM] jorian#4555
but right now it's easier to start on ETH than it is on KMD

[24-May-19 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
that right there is a misnomer that is setting us back

[24-May-19 06:27 PM] Alright#0419
you don't "use KMD" for anything other than dpow

[24-May-19 06:27 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we dont need more cryptonoobs hodling the coin and saying it will moon, we need more developers building

I read the comments above about marketing etc. 
But I do see some nice mentions about $KMD as a long term investment, like from this trader, he's quite popular on CT:

what Komodo is trying to do is a nuisance to the establishment. 
the vested interests are annoying to change.
good projects are coming? 
the reality was just overflowing with garbage dicos.
I respect komodo passion and vision, but the world does not flow as you think. 
you have to be flexible and strategic. 
If you do not want to become a scammer who sells dreams, you have to face reality.

[25-May-19 04:01 AM] designer#4893
the world's first dico? blocknation?
bank and blockchain meeting? monaize?

[25-May-19 04:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Utrum was successful

[25-May-19 04:01 AM] designer#4893
wasn't it all ruined as a result?

[25-May-19 04:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No,  time doesn‚Äôt stop, we just move on and keep building.

[25-May-19 04:05 AM] designer#4893
Yeah, let's just keep building it up like you said.

don't you think the Komodo Platform, which maximizes freedom, is a good platform for fraudsters? what are you going to do with the social damage? do we have to sit on the sidelines? 
you're just gonna ignore it like a failed dicos?

[25-May-19 04:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No,  typically fraudsters like to maximize gain,  easier to create a Waves token or erc20 than an assetchain and all the necessities to get incorporated in komodo products

[25-May-19 04:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Projects fail it happens.

[25-May-19 04:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But others have been successful

[25-May-19 04:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Does an ICO on eth failing affect it? Why should it be any different with KMD

It's hard to know who to believe in the end. There is no black and white. Just a giant mishmash of motives, priorities, and dreams. Every time I think I understand wtf is going on... everything gets turned on it's head. I fell so hard for the @airratchet bs that I had to step back for a sec. Not since paycoin did I get fooled that hard.  Some lessons are more expensive than others.

For people who follow KMD, it's easy to understand there's great tech behind it. 

But it doesn't have a strong , unique  identity and memes like ARRR has for example, or even RVN. 

Also the Komodo website still having a message at the top saying it's an interim site, after months, doesn't help, it would be better to take that "under construction" message off completely. 

I think the Lizard UI for easily creating blockchains, similarly to the one Ravencoin have, would really help. I heard about it quite a while ago and after that there have been no more news. Just my thoughts.

[25-May-19 09:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Pirate has a much simpler mission. I think the main thing to look at is scope.  kmd is doing everything. smart contracts, dex, multicoin/multiprotocol wallet. It's a different beast than RVN entirely. putting it all in a package and putting a neat little bow on it is a challenge. Still too much hype and too little real usage for kmd to show it's value. One could view ARRR's success as a testament to the power of kmd however.

[25-May-19 09:54 AM] jorian#4555
ARRR is just one of the many applications of KMD tech

[25-May-19 09:54 AM] jorian#4555
imagine a lot of other applications made great in ARRR style

[25-May-19 09:54 AM] jorian#4555
üöÄ ?

[25-May-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be that KMD is too complex to market to end users. after all is linux being marketed as a product to end users?

[25-May-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yet, many many many products are built with linux

[25-May-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to apply a consumer product marketing model to KMD... not sure why that is the metric many people are wanting to maximize

[25-May-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless, the KMD marketcap is holding pretty much steady through the years, even as there keep arriving all these hype coins, so we must be doing something right. much rather be known as the coin with a lot of great tech but not so much marketing, than the other way around
