"Nobody thinks about security until a 51% attack - if you want an independent chain then you need Komodo's delayed proof of work"

my understanding is delayed proof of work is a counter - it's a core part of the offering... I'd lean in with that

[03-Jul-18 01:39 PM] benohanlon#1119
You could do variations on that - focus on specific problem / solution - this is how we want to build newsjacking with meltwater IMO.

[03-Jul-18 01:40 PM] benohanlon#1119
Those kind of statements are going to make people curious...

[03-Jul-18 01:40 PM] benohanlon#1119
Basically we need better headlines.

"Nobody thinks about security until their exchange is hacked - if you want to keep control of your private keys while trading then you need BarterDEX"

@benohanlon  bounty0x

[03-Jul-18 03:58 PM] Meyse#0952
I heard someone explain dpow as creating checkpoints for your blockchain. I liked it

[03-Jul-18 03:58 PM] benohanlon#1119
I like that @Meyse

[03-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Meyse#0952
Makes it more comprehensible imo

[03-Jul-18 04:00 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@sœÜldat  I added "at a fraction of the cost" as it is a unique differentiator that we can even extend bitcoin level security, but at the cost we offer it makes it a no brainer.

[03-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@Meyse  the way i've been positioning it is as a regular backup, where we take a point in place snapshot that we can restore

[03-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Steve Lee#1967
this is similar to a checkpoint

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] benohanlon#1119
I like a checkpoint much more than a backup

{Reactions}

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] benohanlon#1119
as we often have to explain it's a counter

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] benohanlon#1119
i feel like a checkpoint is great because people understand you'd restart at a checkpoint

[03-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Steve Lee#1967
how is that different than a backup restore?

[03-Jul-18 04:04 PM] benohanlon#1119
a backup is something you're saving... to use it you feel like you lost

whereas a checkpoint has a more positive connotation because you're still in motion... 

maybe ive played too much mario kart?

[03-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Steve Lee#1967
haha

[03-Jul-18 04:04 PM] benohanlon#1119
but you see what i mean? a checkpoint in my mind means you're in motion üòÑ

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Steve Lee#1967
i guess it depends on how you define "checkpoint"

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] benohanlon#1119
a back-up is for floppy disks

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Very good analogy @benohanlon  It does feel like the difference of a positive connotation versus a negative.

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Daniel CP#2020
yeah checkpoints in the US is where they make sure you're not drunk driving ha

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] benohanlon#1119
I was thinking of Komodo having a mario kart graphic with that üòÑ

[03-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Steve Lee#1967
backup recovery is a common enterprise technology use case

[03-Jul-18 04:06 PM] benohanlon#1119
checkpoint denoates stages in a race

[03-Jul-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is exactly a dynamic checkpoint

[03-Jul-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
in the code that checks for checkpoints

[03-Jul-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
actually

[03-Jul-18 04:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
When I think of backups; I tend to float to system restores and those never bring good feelings up :/

[03-Jul-18 04:07 PM] benohanlon#1119
a checkpoint is more visual too - something that would be easy to create a graphic for

[03-Jul-18 04:07 PM] benohanlon#1119
ive never seen an image of a sexy backup

[03-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Meyse#0952
yeah its the weight of words i suppose, checkpoint=light, backup=hard

[03-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Steve Lee#1967
but we're talking about protection

[03-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Steve Lee#1967
depends on approach I suppose as i'm much more used to not needing to be positive for DR and BC

[03-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Steve Lee#1967
it's always pushed as a risk mitigation and needing to quantify the cost of an attack

[03-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Meyse#0952
restoring a backup sounds like a lot more work then going back to a checkpoint

[03-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Steve Lee#1967
yes agreed

[03-Jul-18 04:09 PM] benohanlon#1119
we really need some visual metaphors for komodo too

[03-Jul-18 04:10 PM] benohanlon#1119
checkpoint works nicely

[03-Jul-18 04:10 PM] benohanlon#1119
communicates that they're in a race

[03-Jul-18 04:10 PM] benohanlon#1119
that we're giving them extra lives

[03-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Meyse#0952
gamification is a trend anyway ;D

[03-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Steve Lee#1967
2 different audiences will interpret it differently. we can message test checkpoints

[03-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Steve Lee#1967
but b2b will want to understand an analogy that is relevant to their businesses

[03-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Steve Lee#1967
every company large or small understand disaster recovery and business continuity

[03-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we can't really position DR, but it is a similar concept in how data protection has become a proactive design requirement, when it used to be an afterthought

[03-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Steve Lee#1967
checkpoints do have a very specific meaning in the states, but i do get the video game metaphor

[03-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean, I like checkpoint as well, but Iron Mountain, AWS, and IBM all use "backup" for their product names and descriptions

[03-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Regnar#6164
which might translate better in b2b

[03-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Steve Lee#1967
backup recovery is widely understood, but data protection is the umbrella term that has a whole set of solutions

[03-Jul-18 04:16 PM] Meyse#0952
for me dpow is easier explained in visuals with checkpoints, how to explain it to businesses could be better like a backup, but i dont know whats best

[03-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We'll need to further message test the checkpoint concept

[03-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Steve Lee#1967
But if someone asks "ok so what exactly is a checkpoint, and how is that actually done?"

[03-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Steve Lee#1967
then you'd need an analogy or simplified explanation on that

[03-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <27aume:matrix.org> heyhey, just passing to let you know that barterdex isnt in the coingecko exchange list. Im not aware of the requirement and everything, just passing the word.

Coinex is really starting to emerge it is a bch base trading pair exchange and they have a 0 listing fee.

[03-Jul-18 10:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
When they add coins they usually run a promotion to get you to hold your coins on the exchange by giving away their CET tokens to people who do it. I honestly did this with Siacoin awhile ago and the CET I earned is worth 170 bucks today üòÖ

maybe they can artificially pump KMD like they did BTC/USDT? :troll:

Bitmain owned exchange; bitmain sell it's btc on bitmain owned exchange...

[03-Jul-18 11:08 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Why would they give that volume to someone else lol

[03-Jul-18 11:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If their going to reward people who hold their exchanges coin by moving their own money through it. I'm not going to sneer on the sidelines when I can just hold and let them pump their exchange to number 1

[03-Jul-18 11:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@BlackJesus  i'll pass this along to Benny, who handles exchange listings. thanks for sharing!

[04-Jul-18 04:09 AM] Mylo#8306
there's a (fairly newish but very very useful) feature of kmd assetchains to self-detect if they are on a fork and auto-rewind (using these notarization checkpoints).  this happened for the first time in the wild on may 21.
the use case encountered was during the initial sync of a chain and has been documented for some writing to be made from it.  @Steve Lee it's in the team wiki under my space with a few pages of relevant chat from notary node chatter about it.

the feature reads as though it could be extended to non-kmd-ecosystem chains in the future.

[04-Jul-18 04:23 AM] Mylo#8306
so there's one really useful `checkpoint` example.  helps lots of nodes sync and stay in sync without the need for a team of engineers to mollycoddle a blockchain to sync across multiple nodes.

[04-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Mylo#8306
so it lowers the barrier to entry for a dApp or organisation to enter the blockchain space without needing to be blockchain operations experts, e.g. lowers operational costs yet again by using notarization.

[04-Jul-18 07:34 AM] RAE#3178
Hey, I've designed a marketing graphic for Komodo but I can't post it on Discord for some reason. How can I get it to the team?

Thought this might help with attracting migration onto the platform ... and just general marketing.

[04-Jul-18 07:46 AM] RAE#3178
Can be adjusted easily, just let me know and I'll sort it.

[04-Jul-18 07:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
Nice idea however the highway looks congested which is not the message it should transmit.

[04-Jul-18 07:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's taking you from nowhere and getting you to "the information super-highway"
is what I got out of it anyway

[04-Jul-18 08:03 AM] RAE#3178
Haha, nice ComputerGenie. The narrative (jokingly) is from the scummy back roads blockchain, single lane, insecure and slow, upgrading to the secure and fast moving multi lane city (Komodo's assetchains). Got the idea from Steve Lee's traffic analogy.

[04-Jul-18 08:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I must say I don't find the picture self-explaining

[04-Jul-18 08:09 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

maybe traffic jam vs flyng cars would be more clear?

[04-Jul-18 08:13 AM] RAE#3178
Maybe just the Delorean with a KMD symbol on the side will do... most people can relate to that.

[04-Jul-18 08:14 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
