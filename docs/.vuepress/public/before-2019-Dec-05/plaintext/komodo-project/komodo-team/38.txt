OK thanks for that too, let me double check on that one

[17-Aug-18 04:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I think it was called alpha release when they announced it but we might be trying to walk that back to manage expectations due to limited liquidity

[17-Aug-18 04:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
But I will check on it for sure

[17-Aug-18 04:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the date for ICO has been changed to 2017, but it should be 2016

[17-Aug-18 04:55 PM] Daniel CP#2020
All fixed now

[17-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Regnar#6164
Hey just thinking about the whole point of a DEX being to have p2p trading and prevent censorship, maybe we should offer versions of BarterDEX downloadable as torrents?

[17-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean, it doesn't need to be an official thing, but it could be useful for us to get an official Komodo account on PirateBay to host BarterDEX. That way when people download it they can trust the version they get from the Komodo account?

[17-Aug-18 07:04 PM] Regnar#6164
as opposed to just downloading it from some random person hosting it.

[17-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Regnar#6164
And then we just update it with the newest versions as they come out. I'm not sure how effective it would be at bypassing censors seeing as they likely block piratebay, but there are dozens of PB mirror sites that can get by. And I'm sure if a country tries to crack down on downloading this type of stuff they'd likely start by cracking down on github, and crypto sites like Komodo

Easier would be IPNS served download links.

For torrent not necessarily meed any specific website login. Only tracker is enough and a .torrent file or magenet link.

I also expressed to team to consider our website on Tor and I2P network like Zcash has, since we are a privacy concerned project.

[17-Aug-18 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also a good idea to highlight somewhere on website and other places that cypherpunks can also connect with us on Martix Network, which is better than other chat, along with IRC bridged general channel.
Not sure if discord is still irc bridged. ü§î

[17-Aug-18 10:00 PM] Regnar#6164
yes, I agree with all this. I think being available through multiple avenues would be a great idea. having a p2p exchange, and privacy focused tech is great, but defeats the purpose if it's only available in a centralized location.

[17-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Regnar#6164
I think it is also probably a good idea for us to be the one's who starts the seeding on some main sites as we can build a reliable base. instead of downloading original from an unknown that may or may not have code changes and be malicious, having a Komodo platform that releases the updates would be the safest for users. Though I'm not sure if changes can be made to it and still "seed" it as the original? that might be a security concern we may have to address? If they can't modify the code and still seed it as the original then it shouldn't be a problem.

[17-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Regnar#6164
providing magnet link might be enough

[18-Aug-18 12:02 AM] Regnar#6164
I was just showing someone how a single space can change an entire Seed phrase and picked a random short string of words and someone actually stored funds in the address.... not a lot lol like $0.10 worth of KMD but still lol WHY

Put out an informal announcement on telegram telling everyone that if they are storing funds in a crappy seed to please move it haha, don't want to put this poor person's $0.10 in the wrong hands

the other 1% will also be attracted by the message and go deeper to read why, and will not be disappointed

[18-Aug-18 06:37 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
For me good marketing is education. And education you always start with most simple message and then you split into more and more details topics. This way it is clear and logic, attractive and easy to deal with mind.

[18-Aug-18 09:52 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Maybe even shorter would be "KMD already got what NEO, Verge, Eth, Dash dreams about" -> massive CMC or google ad (directing to bitttrex KMD sale point? maybe even deal with bittrex to double chain efforts) with that on fine keywords  -> wait 2nd marketcap :trollface:

[18-Aug-18 09:53 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Before true ad campaing - just try 1 day (cheaper then full month or week) and see what happens. If make sense -> repeat for a month and see. Best when bear market is not so active.

[18-Aug-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
prices for advertising have not gone down due to bear market, but due to bear market it costs a lot more reserves. there are still many projects that raised tens of millions or hundreds and are spending like crazy on advertising.

[18-Aug-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
unless we have people who want to donate to pay for such thing, then it is of course a totally different story

[18-Aug-18 10:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess specific targetting to the people you need, and not just the general investor (maybe keywords like "blockchain solution for your company" etc etc not the things normal people on reddit would google) could lower the price significantly and bring some partnerships or investors interest?

I was paying around 1 cent per view on my ad which was pretty broad, and got around 4000 affiliates who clicked, verified and used  some shitty exchange for $6000 or so.

If you target really specific keywords, then I'm guessing it wouldn't cost more than a few tenners a week, and may hit the target audience you wanted, though it might not as well LOL.

[18-Aug-18 12:12 PM] PTYX#6840

It can cost some kmd to make a proposal and a vote

[18-Aug-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jl777c  well in that case ads expensive if there is no gaps in good keywords.

[18-Aug-18 12:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
sometimes good agencies can find some gaps in targeting keywords that make ads cheaper, but on competitive market might be noe so many.

[18-Aug-18 12:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@PTYX proposals at least initial should be quite cheap - possible someone will have good proposals but not so much KMD - in that case he would be silent... better would be to limit proposals per account per blocks (if your intent is to reduce spam?)

[18-Aug-18 12:24 PM] PTYX#6840
I've been giving it some thought and initially I thought it would be simpler to just fork the dash dashboard but there are many factors that wouldn't fit to the Komodo ecosystem. We would need to come up with a proposal mechanism. In dash, you have master nodes with voting power and users can vote by vouching funds. It's all done through multisig so the funds can be returned if it falls through or if funds need to be re-allocated

[18-Aug-18 12:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Aside from the technical aspect of repurposing the dashboard, we would have to explore ways of encouraging voting and participation.

[18-Aug-18 12:26 PM] PTYX#6840
Maybe we can include notary nodes as entities with proposal Power..... Not sure yet

[18-Aug-18 12:42 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@PTYX that sounds good Usable for many purposes not only crypto projects but any projects like on kickstarter.

[18-Aug-18 12:44 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes. My plan is to expand our faucet dashboard to include governance and marketing functions. I'll be exploring some options when I have more funding. In my eyes this type of governance is long overdue for Komodo.

[18-Aug-18 12:45 PM] PTYX#6840
I'll start by quoting how much work it would take to repurpose the existing tools.

[18-Aug-18 01:52 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm iffy on ads. I think we should (and we are currently doing this process) first establish what it is our goals and measure of successes are. This could be increase in price (not a great one imo) user adoption (as currency),  launch more dICOs, launch more ACs (businesses or projects), migrate tokens to KMD AC, etc. but find which segment we are best suited to cater to, is attractive for adoption and the ecosystem, and is an opportunity for growth in both users and developers. 

Only then should we re-position our branding, tech, and focus to cater to these solutions (not excluding the other segments) and then find out the best way to target advertisement and marketing towards actual segments. For example, ad space on an exchange landing page could help traders buy KMD and increase price, but if our target segment is say, AC migration, we would be much better off spending money sending reps to coin meetups where other dev teams will be there in person.

[18-Aug-18 01:59 PM] Regnar#6164
Based on a focused plan and target segment we should be able to actually measure the cost of every increase in our metrics when measuring our success. For example, a $5000 ad on CMC may show us click through and we can try to associate it to a measurable increase in say "user adoption" or price, but that would be a reach of an argument. On the other hand $5000 for a table and airfare + hotel at a blockchain conference in which we get a commitment from an erc20 token to migrate to Komodo, or a business that wants to use an AC to build an audit/notary base. Would be measurable to split those costs.

It comes down to what we WANT to accomplish, as in the main goal we want to focus on or problem we are trying to solve, the segment that is having those problems, and how do we get in front of them to show our solutions. The measure of success isn't always shown in price either, but increased network effect and ecosystem breadth can lead to greater prices later.

my 2 satoshis

[18-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Regnar#6164
But again, this is what is being done. It takes time and rebranding isn't easy. It's also important to realize that if we (as individual investors) are not the target segment, our avenues likely won't see the marketing efforts targeted towards that segment. unless we look for it, or someone shows us

Neat article. The description of Komodo seems a little lite though.

[18-Aug-18 03:11 PM] joe2x4#5987
Oh, I see. They probably got the summary of what Komodo is from the webpage as they mostly viewed Komodo as a dico platform.

[18-Aug-18 03:16 PM] joe2x4#5987
As I was reading down the list, I was like, Komodo does that and that  and that but then no mention of any of those things under our description. Eos isn't even on the working product list though, lol, and they were ranked higher then komodo by the Chinese tech rankings.

[18-Aug-18 03:19 PM] joe2x4#5987
