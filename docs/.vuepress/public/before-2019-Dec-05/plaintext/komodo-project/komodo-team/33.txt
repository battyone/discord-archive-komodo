What would also be helpful, is if we can find examples of the actual technical architecture of their solution and examples of current smart contract usage. This will help us understand if our CC smart contracts can meet the same requirements.

" I'm not sure about the Anti Money Laundering section though, with zksnarks"

This is what worries me when regulations sets in. Although I did see Monero on that list.

[03-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Zksnarks can be used to as a method of protecting private information, business information that you don't want your competitors to know about, even HIPAA transactions

Someone should make a sticky for our subreddit. I went on google to try and find out how hard it would be to find out about the tech we have, and it's not the easiest LOL.
There were a few small places, but I think the main place people look is reddit to begin with, so having a stickied "What is Komodo" might be a good idea

[05-Aug-18 08:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
From the outside we do sort of look like every other blockchain platform, so having a few keypoints and explainer paragraphs would help people understand more I think

"We have infinite scaling through ___chains and they are all secured by dPoW, which _________. We also offer this service for other blockchains who wish to secure themselves against attacks"

btw it may make sense to donate some sites like CoinFairValue or Bloctivity for building alternatives for CMC

[05-Aug-18 10:06 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it make sense, since they 1. could stop their sited if they don't have revenue 2. they do sth positive also for KMD 3. if they get some tips they will most probably use it for marketing to be more recognized and KMD will also benefit from that

[05-Aug-18 10:08 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I believe all treu projects should donate these alternatives (if they are found to give some additional value for the crypto space)

[05-Aug-18 12:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I think the Bitdegree would be a great idea. their Zcash one seemed more about the zkSNARK idea and how it worked, maybe we can have them write an article on Atomic Swaps that we can provide information for and possibly when the nuances of the tech are finalized, MoMoM scaling.
