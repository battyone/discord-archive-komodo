@Gordon Komodo  the post will likely be put back to it's original state.  following the link, the "scam" is KYC/AML with a user submitting a fake id / forged photo from google - hard to say it's a scam based on that thread when the user in question admits to doing silly things...

@hvaminion @Bl0ckchain Notarizing to $BTC is very expensive. Why pay double, when kmd is already notarizing to btc? Notarizing to $KMD costs about 300kmd and 300 of the coin to be notarized yearly.

This answer makes sense to the guy posing the question right?

[15-Sep-18 07:10 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A lot more than double

[15-Sep-18 07:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean double in the sense of kmd pays btc to notarize to btc and the newcoin pays btc to notarize to btc
