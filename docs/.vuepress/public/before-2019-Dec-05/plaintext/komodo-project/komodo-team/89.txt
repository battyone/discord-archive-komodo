A browser extension with ledger/HW capabilities is probably the best option.

@barnum what are you building for polkadot and enzyme? Apps or extensions

[21-Jun-19 01:58 PM] barnum#1699
Enzyme is the name of the wallet we're building for polkadot.

Basically we want to build metamask style wallets for every network. 

The convenience of a web wallet - with keys you own/control

[21-Jun-19 02:00 PM] PTYX#6840
Open source

[21-Jun-19 02:00 PM] PTYX#6840
?

[21-Jun-19 02:02 PM] barnum#1699
Yep - https://github.com/blockxlabs/enzyme

That's what we're building for polkadot. Still in development

The bots did get smart and started waiting a day or so after they joined to spam. So it's just a bandaid but it helps

@barnum if you ripped out the aion/web3 stuff and made a basic bitcoin version, how would you do it?   
here is a kmdrpc component for a vue app.   it's supposed to use browser's fetch api (but my latest work removing axios needs to be comitted).
take what you want to experiment https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-cakeshop/tree/fetch-restructure/src/app/shared/components/kmdrpc

i think that component once axios is removed has dev dependencies of babel-cli only.

[24-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Mylo#8306
when i say "component" it's just a rpc wrapper lib....used as a shared component in a vue app

[24-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Mylo#8306
any misisng pieces are pretty easy to add.   it's all been stubbed out for a janitor project to come back to.

[24-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Mylo#8306
if you're doing some work over the next 1-2 months on it, i think there are some students from a university that might be able to participate.

[24-Jun-19 03:43 PM] Mylo#8306
we have some academic partner program with university of texas arlington, some of the students are currently doing some wrapper api work with go/python/js  or are looking to do it / integrate stuff.

[24-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm completing a docker image with several guided tutorials for starting a chain, funding a faucet, grabbing a small amount of coins from the faucet, generating tokens and making a token dex.   all with a text user interface, and instructions how to turn it from text user interface into dapps in py/go/js and if i can get some other langs like ruby/dart/c++/java snippets for ppl to tinker with, it's off to the races for them to see how makes progress the fastest.

Isn't pirate the new Jumblr

[28-Jun-19 11:15 PM] LooTz#2749
Yea i guess what im saying is because unique algos like pirate is there a need to jumble a tx?

[28-Jun-19 11:22 PM] LooTz#2749
It may be a silly question

[29-Jun-19 12:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kmd has removed privacy features for now , may appear as a side chain in the future ,  but Pirate is best for privacy

[29-Jun-19 12:25 AM] PTYX#6840
jumblr in essence was a sequence of private transactions in denominations and with time delays.

[29-Jun-19 12:26 AM] PTYX#6840
it's plausible that someone else can implement it. Nix has a sort of Jumblr with their token being the private  layer

[29-Jun-19 12:41 AM] allbits#5898
The JUMBLR asset still has value apart from the deprecated jumblr function. It receives 10% of dex revenues. It also owns 50% of BET which may have future revenue streams.

[29-Jun-19 06:58 AM] hastrup#8742
@allbits where so you ha e that info from? Can anyone confirm?

[29-Jun-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i can confirm

[29-Jun-19 09:21 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c thxüëç can anyone link to a place where I can read an in depth overview.

[29-Jun-19 09:22 AM] hastrup#8742
My source was this

[29-Jun-19 09:22 AM] hastrup#8742
Total Coin Supply: 1,000,000

The JUMBLR asset chain is tied to the fees that are required to use Jumblr. JUMBLR also receives 15% of the dex-fee revenue share. Jumblr‚Äôs zk-SNARK transactions are dramatically larger in data-size than a normal transparent transaction. To create an economic balance for this increased amount of network usage, users are required to pay a 0.3% fee for using Jumblr.

These fees are collected in the following address: Jumblr Fee Holding Address
Payouts of the dividends from Jumblr usage and from the 15% dex-fee revenue share are distributed proportionally to the holders of the JUMBLR asset coins.

please do not worry - this is common in our industry as most projects are work in progress. Even zcash has such warnings to point out that this is new software:

I know @PTYX was in our Dash Talk chat recently, asking about a Latam partnership, I wanted to let him know about another potential lead, the AnyPay POS folks were talking about integrating KMD a while back, via DM with me, I got to use their POS in New Hampshire on a Dash biz trip, would love to see an integration there, their POS is crypto agonstic and works great with Dash, I am trying to duplicate this locally in Ohio now, Ohio has fiat gateways with Bittrex that have a USD pair for KMD.  Somebody want to DM me about reaching out to AnyPay?

With the launch of Antara, will there be a new updated whitepaper? Or is that going to take longer?

Hey ALL üòÉ. A project I manage (THC) is in need of some Development Support. The chain will go live soon, and besides me there is a couple people working on this project. Until the new chain gets migrated there are no dev rewards, so creating new things with no funds is tough, even listing on exchanges is tough because they want funds for this. 
I believe in this project, because i have seen the value of hemp (in its use) and its close cousins as an integral part of how we can make a change to benefit our global community.
THC plans on building a supply chain mechanism on UTXO tech, this would not be possible without KMD, which is why i am reaching out here today.
If you would like to help do not hesitate to DM me or email too, adam@hempcoin.org.
thank you for your time, and have a beautiful day!

Good day. I found this forum as no one is giving me feedback on twitter ir Facebook.  My Komodo was kept in an Agama wallet. Now when i try to sign into tge wallet it indicates something about another server. I only used Agama as i was advises in KMD twitter to use Agama. What should i do to retrieve my komodo. Thanks
