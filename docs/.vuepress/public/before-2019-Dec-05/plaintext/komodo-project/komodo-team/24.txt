[17-Jul-18 10:56 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
So I was recently talking about KMD in a crypto trade group. I knew right off the bat these guys are anti KMD, but never got a clear answer out from them. I finally got it, and of course its around the history of JL777 and the moves from NXT to BTCD and then BTCD to KMD.

I was able to answer the move from NXT to BTCD (NXT devs changed their vision for the project and JL777 decided to move on since it was counter intuitive to what supernet was trying to do)

The move from BTCD was to incorporate ZK Snark technology from ZEC to provide real privacy for supernet and all the projects (from my understanding but not 100% sure about this)

However, I couldn't answer the question of why KMD needed an ICO and where the ICO funds came from. These guys are under the impression that all these moves were money grabs. New ICOs to get more BTC. I know BTCD to KMD was a swap, but there was also an ICO. Does anyone know where the ICO funds came from?

Of course these guys took it a step further to say not only did the project grab more BTC by having another ICO, but BTCD value was hurt when KMD was announced allowing for an easy pump and dump scheme to occur to get even more BTC. Double dipping on the BTCD to KMD swap so to speak

Think it would be nice to be able to answer these concerns of people. A lot of old school people have a negative view of the project and a lot of these old school people have money/influence. Think it would be good to address this stuff in some way

[17-Jul-18 11:10 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
thats the question I couldn't answer. If KMD was just an upgrade to BTCD then why was there an ICO for KMD. Think of it like a project launching their own token and getting off of ETH. There is a swap for the ERC20 token for the real coin, but there isn't another ICO

[17-Jul-18 11:10 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
this I couldn't answer so if anyone has an answer I would like to share it with this group and any other KMD haters I come across in the future

[17-Jul-18 11:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The ICO was to fund DPoW for a dozen or so years until Komodo became self sustaining

[17-Jul-18 11:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And development of course, but much more towards the former(90% )than the latter.

[17-Jul-18 11:15 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
ok I know if I go back with just that answer people will scream cash grab and say "see they just wanted more BTC". If I can prove that BTC are being spent every notarization then I think that will help. Is there a way to check each notarization and how much BTC it cost, like on a blockexplorer maybe?

[17-Jul-18 11:41 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
most people don't have time to look into every project @Deleted User there's so many projects out there and in the past marketing has fallen short for KMD. People write off scammy projects and unfortunately the complicated history of this project has turned people away.

[17-Jul-18 11:42 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
hostility toward these people doesn't help the cause either. I'm taking the time out to get good answers to inform people and help promote KMD in a positive light. These guys aren't stupid, but have a huge demand on their time and can't dive into slack/discord to find these answers. A red flag appears from a high level view and thats all they need to move on

The Ico was mainly necessary to pay for BTC notarization fees

[18-Jul-18 12:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
You can‚Äôt dPoW to BTC without paying BTC fees. And that adds up

[18-Jul-18 12:15 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Very necessary in my opinion. And differs from most projects that take the btc and spend it all. At least all Komodo and all of the assetchains are benefiting from dPoW.

I did some math on my node on its own and how much BTC cost of notarization's add up and its a lot.

[18-Jul-18 12:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can see by amount received in the btc address above how much is used in notarization then add fees on top

[18-Jul-18 12:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My node had over $5000 AUD put in it after election from the ICO fund, and it already nearly gone. And I am one of the lower nodes in counts. Its a horribly expensive process at the current market price. Although it would still be cheaper at these prices than paying for BTC hash power, which is some astronomical amount money.

[18-Jul-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Without the ICO to fund the process back when BTC was cheap, it would likely be all but impossible to have this platform in its current state.

I have also heard some of these things when I first came here from outsiders, but upon looking around, found most of the stuff to be baseless FUD.

Was one of the opponents by any chance 'notsofast'?

[18-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, the BTCD holders got more than 10x returns from the kmd swap, kmd ico was done mainly to cover notarizations fees for the following 12 years

[18-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd ico participants also have more than 10x returns

[18-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So don't really see why/how people would categorize it as a moneygrab

when everyone benefited greatly

[18-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Audo#5667
@ResoluteCrypto I can point out few additional things:

 - I don' know how BTCD project got started initially, but when jl777 joined the project (later) there were no funding for it
 - BTCD was envisioned to be part of the NXT system (I call it SuperNET 1.0), so I would say there was just one change from NXT+BTCD -> KMD (but there indeed was a period when the plan was to move everything 100% under BTCD).
 - Komodo was created because of two things 1) privacy and 2) security. The dPoW implementation needed money, and a lot of the ICO budget was put aside for those Bitcoin notarizations that we have been doing everyday since day 1.
 - In general, the whole blockchaini industry keeps evolving very fast, and things must change and change and change. I don't know how anyone could not see that. Thus obviously under SuperNET things have been changing and changing too for our project to stay innovative. However, the vision has always stayed the same. The difference is, that jl777 respects the previous investors and doesn't abondon any project.

I killed BTCD by making its price go from 10 cents to $100, sorry

[18-Jul-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
I did a total of 2 ICO, SuperNET and KMD. SuperNET funds have grown over the years more than 10x even after all the expenditures and KMD ICO did ok so far. The vast majority of the BTC from KMD ICO is to pay for notarization fees, we had to do an ICO otherwise dPoW would not exist and without dPoW none of the assetchains would be secure. I explained this many times, even during the ICO!

[18-Jul-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
So if making BTCD go to $100+ is killing it, and that is the basis of anti-jl777 sentiment, well what is the complaint? it should have been $1000?

I‚Äôm just guessing here as I haven‚Äôt dug deeply. But aside from people just not ‚Äúgetting‚Äù kmd at first glance, here are the common reactions I get:

[18-Jul-18 04:22 PM] tolken#2655
1. Who‚Äôs this jl777 guy.

[18-Jul-18 04:22 PM] tolken#2655
2. Kmd is too late to the game

[18-Jul-18 04:23 PM] tolken#2655
3. I looked at the website, what does it do?

[18-Jul-18 04:25 PM] tolken#2655
1. I agree with jl777‚Äôs point that having open source and a track record is far more important than a closed project with well know names attached. That said, I think it might serve KMD marketing well to refer to jl777 as James Lee exclusively.

[18-Jul-18 04:26 PM] tolken#2655
2. I disagree with their assessment here and think kmd is well positioned to provide game changing services to the masses with some of the smart contract/scaling jl777 has hinted at.

[18-Jul-18 04:27 PM] tolken#2655
3. Doesn‚Äôt seem like KMD has a clear audience yet, so message isn‚Äôt as laser focused as could be, but seems kmd 2.0 branding is making some good headway with this.

[18-Jul-18 04:28 PM] tolken#2655
KMD has an image issue. People look at Ethos wallet and drool. I tell them about Agama and they just shrug. It doesn‚Äôt feel safe to them for some reason. Not sure what the answer to that is ultimately.

[18-Jul-18 04:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the rebranding will make the messages different for end users or for business/developers. For now the target has been more the latter and it seems to work fine IMO. For end users it's been somewhat harder so far

[18-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Targeted persona based messaging will definitely be part of the rebranding efforts.

[18-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We do have a bit of an identity issue. As we're a growing and evolving project there are times that this identity will also change.
