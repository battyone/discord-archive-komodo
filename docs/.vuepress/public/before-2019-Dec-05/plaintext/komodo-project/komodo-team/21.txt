@KomodoPlatform @kucoincom Seriously @kucoincom dPoW protects YOU from 51% attacks, not just attacks on KMD, but attacks of all the projects using dPoW now and in the future, like @utrumdotio @gamecredits @kredsblockchain @Chainzillaio @bloc_social @OfficialEQL @VerusCoin ...

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking we could probably make a marketing plan and material to specifically target CEXs

[12-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Regnar#6164
something that we could reach out to different exchanges that don't have KMD and show them why dPoW will actually protect them from double spends (they just need to have easy access to verify notarizations, I'm not sure if there is a simple location to find notarizations?)

[12-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Regnar#6164
which could help them decide to list KMD, and also to list coins built on Komodo that use dPoW

[12-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Regnar#6164
thoughts from the marketing channel?

[12-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
KuCoin has their own ERC20 coin as well

[12-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tell them if they list kmd and do some promo we will migrate their coin to an assetchain for free

[12-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Regnar#6164
yea we could secure it hahaha

[12-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Regnar#6164
thats good!

[12-Jul-18 01:41 PM] Regnar#6164
I like that idea. okay so what is the incentive for an exchange to maintain an erc20 token?

[12-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then the road to BNB is right open ;p

[12-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We're not quite ready to start integrating ERC-20 tokens yet

[12-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There goes my boner

[12-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
haha

[12-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Sorry bro

[12-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
One day!

[12-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeh the plan is to find a small project that wants to migrate and them do it very quietly as a test run

[12-Jul-18 01:43 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Then once the process is smoothed we could open things up a bit more

[12-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Regnar#6164
okay then, back to the other plan, marketing to CEXs by showing how dPoW can protect them from 51% attacks

Komodo 

[12-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Regnar#6164
do we like this idea?

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Regnar#6164
especially for targeting the small exchanges that a single attack would likely wipe out

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Hmm not sure. Might have to huddle with the rest of the team on that one

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
In some ways, I see the benefits

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it can protect them from double spends

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
But in other ways, we would be giving them ground

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Like why help the CEX when we want to push a DEX

[12-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't see crypto as a fight here

[12-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah I feel that way too

[12-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Daniel CP#2020
It might be worth exploring

[12-Jul-18 01:46 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I guess I'm just thinking, we're super limited on time and resources so might be better to focus on marketing BarterDEX as opposed to helping secure CEX

[12-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Regnar#6164
CEX hacks are good for DEX adoption, but any hack is bad for crypto. and pushing dPoW as a protection for exchanges can actually help adoption of dPoW and Komodo chains

[12-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Even though theyd be using Komodo security services

[12-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Regnar#6164
are we even marketing BarterDEX right now?

[12-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Honestly not really haha. But HyperDEX official release is coming soon and we'll def help them with marketing

[12-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Plus we might be getting a new GUI for both Agama and BarterDEX. Although we're not 100% on that yet

[12-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Regnar#6164
okay, so no marketing dPoW to exchanges as a way of demand driven adoption

[12-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'm not saying no, i think it's worth looking into

[12-Jul-18 01:49 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Something we can def talk about

[12-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Regnar#6164
okay, Komodo just retweeted my tweet lol

[12-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
oh nice!

[12-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Sort of where the marketing team is at now: we're re-grouping a bit, figuring out a strategy, and deciding what products/services we really want to push

[12-Jul-18 01:51 PM] Daniel CP#2020
So offering dPoW is def on the table, whether it be to a CEX or a small PoW project

[12-Jul-18 02:02 PM] benohanlon#1119
@Regnar I would like to offer you a seat as an admin on the KIN community - we're posting bounties and wanting to direct people to useful actions. Would you like to help?

Also anyone here tried to contact "Palm Beach Confidential" yet? Seems like theyre a very big name in the groups I'm in (though I reckon they're nothing that special)
"Apparently" you have to pay a few thousand a month to be on their mailing list, but most of their pdfs get leaked on the pages anyway haha. I personally feel like they would consider doing an article on Komodo and the tech we have here

@Regnar  the idea I had discussed before was positioning dpow as something a CEX can utilize (or potentially even enforce) as an added layer of security for coins they list. The idea was to build a business case where we illustrate general benefits, along with the added savings in downtime and support mitigation if they do so. We will however have to wait until dpow for external chains becomes something we GA to the public which won't be until the aug/sep timeframe

I got a question about Atomic/etomic marketing and thought I should paste my answer here too.

> The problem with heavily marketing the swaps is that the pairs have no liquidity. We are going to need few fundamental things in place first.

> 1. Rewamp the UX/UI, which is basically being done now by the HyperDEX team. We will be doing co-marketing with the HyperDEX team once they officially launch. BarterDEX GUI is lacking a clear product brand to attract and maintain a userbase, and the UX/UI is not on the level it should be. As a result many people just try it our out of curiosity and never return.
> 2. We need to formulate a strategy on how we attract liquidity. My thinking is to focus on few pairs and guarantee their liquidity, and the not so liquid pairs are not listed on the dApp itself. Perhaps there should be a requirement to get listed on HyperDEX, e.g. "if you want your coin on HyperDEX you must commit on running a marketmaker for your coin and to provide sufficient liquidity".
> 3. We should also look for ways for a normal users to become a liquidity provider very easily. 
> 4. Some of the DEX branding and positioning is still on the drawing table as our marketing team is preparing for the Komodo rebrand together with 'Ideas By Nature'. Once that is clear we can do better marketing. For example, one thing we have been thinking is building a separate website for the DEX (backend) and highlighting the benefits, expalining that anyone can build a GUI, advertising how you can become liquidity provider, and then listing the existing GUI's like HyperDEX.

[13-Jul-18 08:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If there is an easy way for people with big bags to set up a MM that would definitely attract liquidity

[13-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you design a MM gui, where you just deposit x funds onto the MM wallet and choose the pairs you want to trade against and for which % of the coinmarketcap prices

[13-Jul-18 08:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And just leave the thing running

[13-Jul-18 08:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Because you should make some money when being a marketmaker in most of the cases

[13-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And you could market it as a way for big holders to have some extra returns on their bags

[13-Jul-18 09:11 AM] jorian#4555
i think a marketmaker needs VPS'es and therefore a strong command line tool

[13-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Its easy enough to make a GUI to manage a remote bob. I already have a command line tool for this, its just simple API calls over an ssh tunnel.

[13-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> You can spin up the marketmakers in the cloud... the issue only comes because electrum in bob isn't reliable... There must be a way to make that work. Maybe its a request for MM2.0
