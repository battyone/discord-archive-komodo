Yeah, it can be confusing. Maybe give an concret example with Eth. 
For example, when you create an ERC-20 on Eth, you are 100% dependent on the Eth blockchain.
So if the Eth network crashes, your company crashes too.
And if you want to leave the Eth network you have to develop your own blockchain and swap your ERC-20 tokens, as for EOS for example and can make investors lose confidence and it costs millions.. 
I don't know it's just an idea.

[29-Jun-18 09:07 AM] Audo#5667
yes an example is always the best

[29-Jun-18 10:56 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Make that example into a drama like this

Short segments and keeps the user interested

short and sweet is good. those cheeky youtube ads which last exactly as long as the skip timer are to the point, hard to avoid, and less annoying after seeing 12 times.

[1:53 PM] PTYX: I thought of KiB
KibiByte?

[29-Jun-18 12:04 PM] jorian#4555
KIB Komodo Independent Blockchain

[29-Jun-18 12:04 PM] jorian#4555
in a way, the chains are indepenedent but they have some more value in the komodo platform

[29-Jun-18 12:04 PM] jorian#4555
if someone takes a chain out of the platform, the chain is 'just another blockchain'

[29-Jun-18 12:05 PM] jorian#4555
so i'm for naming it Komodo chain or something

[29-Jun-18 12:05 PM] jorian#4555
include Komodo

[29-Jun-18 12:06 PM] jorian#4555
STaK - Same Tech as Komodo.. STaK could be confusing STRAKS chain

[29-Jun-18 12:11 PM] Audo#5667
What about "Komodo Ecosystem Chain"? In could be shortened as an E-Chain or Komodo E-Chain

> Komodo is building an ecosystem where everyone has an independent E-Chain
> Komodo Main Chain creates interoperability between all Komodo Ecosystem Chains
> Your E-Chain is protected by Bitcoin's hashrate through Komodo's Main Chain

[29-Jun-18 12:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sort of implies its under komodo/running on komodos blockchain though üòÆ

[29-Jun-18 12:39 PM] PTYX#6840
Yup

[29-Jun-18 12:40 PM] PTYX#6840
So Komodo Independent Chain seems to be the most appropriate.

[29-Jun-18 12:40 PM] PTYX#6840
Since KIB can confuse people with kibibyte

[29-Jun-18 12:48 PM] benohanlon#1119
I have an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not offical KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

not that i know. i'm not in the support team anymore but that's the only change I am aware of.

[29-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Steve Lee#1967
In regards to the explanation of independent chains we've been employing two analogies.

[29-Jun-18 05:15 PM] Steve Lee#1967
1) Other platforms/eth are like a giant highway dapps as cars. When there were less cars its was fine, but as the influx of cars exceeded the limited lanes in the highway traffic becomes inevitable.

[29-Jun-18 05:16 PM] Steve Lee#1967
KMD gives you your own dedicated private highway. If you outgrow that, we can add another lane (scaling solution) on demand. We can continue to do this to scale linearly.

[29-Jun-18 05:17 PM] Steve Lee#1967
2) If you lived in an apt complex, would you pay for internet that was being shared by the entire building? Eth/other platforms is like sharing a single wifi/broadband connection and being affected by other people streaming, gaming, or downloading etc

[29-Jun-18 05:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
KMD gives you your own dedicated wifi and internet per unit. If bandwidth usage exceeds you can always upgrade (scaling). This has no limit.

[29-Jun-18 05:19 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we've used the road one a lot with influencers and research groups and press and was well received.

[29-Jun-18 05:19 PM] Steve Lee#1967
the wifi one can be extended to our other pillars, so i'm thinking we might use that one

[29-Jun-18 05:20 PM] Steve Lee#1967
as your wouldn't join a wifi network that allowed anyone to pry into your browsing and history...people deserve privacy

[29-Jun-18 05:21 PM] Steve Lee#1967
you wouldn't join a wifi if they controlled and limited what sites/apps you could access - need interoperability

[29-Jun-18 05:23 PM] Steve Lee#1967
you wouldn't go on a wifi /isp that took hours/days to setup, need special hw, complex configuration. - need simplicity, we have end to end solutions and whitelabel products that accelerate deployment

[29-Jun-18 05:27 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not sold on the wifi analogy

[29-Jun-18 05:31 PM] Steve Lee#1967
ok fair enough

[29-Jun-18 05:32 PM] Steve Lee#1967
just wanted to avoid having separate analogies for each topic we talk about. i'm open to suggestions.

[29-Jun-18 05:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
cars/highway seems like the better angle imo. most people can relate to driving faster with more lanes

We have some time wanted to bring more transparency on our marketing efforts, and as a result of that we have created a public marketing Trello board.

We will keep it up to date and share everything we can. It is a new thing, so there are probably some things missing that I didn't think of. I would us also to document our marketing strategy there later on.

**Public Marketing Board**: https://trello.com/b/xCc8hngf/public-komodo-marketing-board

# How it works

* Post your marketing ideas to our forum or share them on Discord (https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/marketing)
* Ask questions here on this channel
* Provide us feedback on things that are not yet published, so we can do even better marketing!

It's a win-win for our team and for our active community. You will get an insight into what will be happening and we will get valuable feedback and more ideas.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator it was pointing to the email list to focus on  building and increasing signups, and we've reached 12K now + had a lot of growth. I've had this discussion in DMs.

Really we need a stronger popup on the website @Steve Lee.

But I've now changed the link to the website and will switch to sharing FBF links on Sat + Medium summaries @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator. We can put this one to bed üôèüèª

not that this has something to do with marketing, but i highly recommend starting 1 place (an official blog with news updates) where stuff like the 1,000,000 block change is laid out. Putting it on read the docs and linking to it, is not the proper way to announce this

[30-Jun-18 09:24 AM] jorian#4555
just a simple blog post with what is happening and why it is needed

[30-Jun-18 09:33 AM] Audo#5667
we just decided to make a blog post about this change ~1 month before the 1M block. Until then it's just few smaller reminders

[30-Jun-18 10:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@jorian exactly a dedicated blog is needed, where one could track hisotry of changes of anything / not only tech but also new partnerships and other news

yes, what passcombo said. not specifically for that 1M block, but for everything

[30-Jun-18 11:48 AM] jorian#4555
just in the last month, blogs / news updates could've been made about 
- the importance of GAME using dPoW (or maybe after a couple of months to test the time a bit)
- crypto conditions, scaling and all that has been going on in #dev-scalability 
- (a short summary of) the advancements in CHIPS and the creation of the CHIPS community
- the creation of several third party ecosystem developers, like DEVSEC, ChainZilla etc.
- someone doing a write-up about what the consequences of the ASIC for KMD are
- someone doing a write-up about what ZEC is doing and why or why not KMD is integrating their updates

and i'm sure there's more. when bundled in a single location, people start to see that as authorative. that KMD is expert in these things.

[30-Jun-18 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
and it's just handy to follow

[30-Jun-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can help?

[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
most in marketing, the deep tech is not comfortable to write about

[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] jorian#4555
the thing is; i often see people come in and ask james a lot of useful questions. but they get lost and nobody knows what has been said.

[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] jorian#4555
yes, i know

[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] jorian#4555
but it's a simple question from the marketing department, and i don't see that question often

[30-Jun-18 11:51 AM] jorian#4555
that Trello board that just created, is a good start

[30-Jun-18 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
and i dont expect marketing to have deep knowledge about everything KMD does, that isn't possible. maybe a community curated blog? with different people explaining different things?

[30-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Audo#5667
Thank you for the ideas @jorian , they are good ones.

There definitely is room to improve for us. We should produce content in more regular interwals and maybe our focus on a single campaign has made us blind to some of the things we could have blogged about. Many times, however, we need a bit more time to write about something and often we have hard time understanding the technical aspects and angles.

Example 1: You suggested a blog about *"the creation of several third party ecosystem developers, like DEVSEC, ChainZilla etc."* ‚Äì This is definitely a blog we will write. The situation is very young still, however. These businesses are just setting themselves up. Also our business development team is planning how we handle this exactly. Thus it's better to wait for the situation to mature, at least in my opinion. A blog about this in 1 month will be just as powerful as it would be today.

Example 2:  *"someone doing a write-up about what the consequences of the ASIC for KMD are"* ‚Äì sounds interesting, but I'm not sure what this is about. Our marketing team needs a better bridge to the technical minds who would feed us content. Indeend, @jorian if you could help us in this perhaps we could talk. We are looking people like you.

Example 3: - *"someone doing a write-up about what ZEC is doing and why or why not KMD is integrating their updates"* ‚Äì the same as above, our resources are limited and it takes a long time for us to understand these in enough detail to blog about them. We need a dedicated technical person to help us out.

[30-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Audo#5667
*"the importance of GAME using dPoW (or maybe after a couple of months to test the time a bit)"*
 ‚Äì¬†A team decision was made not to draw too much attention to our dPoW promise as of yet, because it's in PEN testing and so on. Thus our marketing team has only been able to retweet mentions and not directly blog about it. We will be making a blog post about this in time once we are ready to market this feature. It will still work as we can interview GAME and explain that they have been using our security service for 3 months without any attacks, and so on.

[30-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Audo#5667
*"crypto conditions, scaling and all that has been going on in #dev-scalability"*
 ‚Äì We have been giving the stress test small mentions here and there. However, it has been a conscious decision on our part not to make too much noise about it until the numbers have been validated and the infrastructure is ready. We haven't had any timeline on how long it takes to setup the infrastructure and it is better to make the noice once we know for sure when the actual live marketable stress test will happen.

*"(a short summary of) the advancements in CHIPS and the creation of the CHIPS community"*
‚Äì Good point, we should, but there is no rush. CHIPS project was started with the decision to have ZERO marketing for it.

[30-Jun-18 12:50 PM] Audo#5667
'All in all let me just sum up this to two points:

1) Yes, our marketing could do better job on few things. We are improving and now we want to get you guys more involved.

2) One problem we have indentified is that Komodo is all over the place ‚Äì¬†and with that we mean the messages we send out through marketing

We are trying to focus on one talking point at a time and build campaigns. Since the ICO our marketing has been reactionary but we want to get to a position when we can plan and anticipate. That means that we are not going to talk about all the "noice" that is going on before it is mature enough to be properly marketed (i.e. CHIPS and Assetchain businesses).

[30-Jun-18 12:50 PM] Audo#5667
**Then what do we talk about today?**
Right now we started our "Komodo Evolution" campaign in which we revealed our 5 technology pillars. We will talk about security, scalability, interoperability, privacy, and simplicity ‚Äì and how a blockchain platform/ecosystem needs them all.

These are the 5 main selling points why a business should use Komodo instead of some other blockchain/technology provider. From this campaign it is natural to transition more towards

 a) scalability test marketing ‚Äì including some short of an online event with a scalability test demonstration
 b) announcing how to get started with Komodo through the 3rd party businesses

[30-Jun-18 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840
Why about Agama?

[30-Jun-18 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840

[30-Jun-18 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840

That is a top priority for marketing and business development. It's is much more than just pushing out news

[30-Jun-18 01:27 PM] PTYX#6840
I can push out news all day.

[30-Jun-18 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, the top 3 marketing "Average Joe" priorities should be:
1) DEX
2) Agama features
3) that a QT wallet exists

[30-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Audo#5667
## Why don't we market Agama Wallet more?

We would love to market Agama Wallet more, but for that to happen our team needs to finalise PEN testing. Our team must be sure that there are no critical bugs or user-experience issues. Our marketing team needs a green light from the testing team.

Next, we need to work out a new landing page the dApp deserves. We might soon have something exciting to announce as Steve has been talking with one Agency who is going to help us build THE BEST multi-coin wallet on the industry. 

According to Steve, these guys are extremely excited about Komodo tech.

[30-Jun-18 01:36 PM] PTYX#6840
Let's hope they get it done before chainzilla
