I always appreciate crypto events that are free to attend, the whole $1500 ticket price thing is kinda bs imo. Anyway maybe we can put it on the team calendar and send a team member to coinfestUK next April.

Hi, I was on the Telegram side sharing my ideas and I decided to come here and see what you all think.
1. We need a tipbot on twitter. One that can send KMD and ARRR to anyone even if they haven't already activated it. This way one can tip another user first and when they ask you "what the F is this KMD" you just say "well, now you are invested in it, so take a look".
2. This is going a bit overboard but: If one could build a same kind of frame to youtube. If youtube wouldn't agree to use tipbots in comment sections, but with a browser extension that recognizes youtube you still could tip ovet youtube to for example crypto tubers.

These would make marketing a thing for the community and Komodo would not need to waste much more time on anything else when it comes to marketing?

[19-Nov-19 01:34 AM] Hember#5341
I have no skills whatsoever to build anything, but I can be the messenger the troll, the comment master, the poor tipper that needs to ask the community to support his tipping habits.

[19-Nov-19 08:07 AM] Oszy#5734
Old Bucanner bot kinda does that just need to tune it up a bit and add KMD

[19-Nov-19 08:50 AM] turinglabs#2390
@Hember sure we can replicate it for KMD, i can build even a web browser extension to save the private key safetly and send tips. We just need to build a couple of other services, but we can work on it!

[19-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Hember#5341
Oszy, someone linked me that twitter bot just yesterday but what I understood about that was that it wasn't a bot that one could just yet use to tip anyone on twitter.

[19-Nov-19 12:26 PM] turinglabs#2390
I think it's the "extension" part

[19-Nov-19 12:26 PM] turinglabs#2390
We can make both

[19-Nov-19 12:26 PM] Hember#5341
I really need to pinpoint that it is important that one could give a tip to anyone even if they haven't already activated the bot themselves. The XRP tipbot is maybe the best at this time.

[19-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Hember#5341
oh, cool!

[19-Nov-19 01:20 PM] turinglabs#2390
@Hember sure it can be done, the idea is that the bot just create an encrypted wallet and send the password via DM (like the old bucaneer). This password + payload can be imported into an extension (like https://id.scryptachain.org or metamask) and the extension will inject the necessary code to youtube / twitter to create a popup and make the transaction

[19-Nov-19 01:25 PM] turinglabs#2390
if you want to send tips directly from the browser we need to know two things: were are the utxo and how to sign transactions from client side (if we want to create a trustless client-side wallet) or we can just create a couple of nodes that knows the private keys of every user and sign stuff in a "centralized" way

[19-Nov-19 01:25 PM] turinglabs#2390
i think the first is the best, for security, transparency and responsibility

[19-Nov-19 01:26 PM] Hember#5341
yeah, true

[19-Nov-19 01:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@turinglabs are you familiar with compiling C code to WASM?

[19-Nov-19 01:27 PM] turinglabs#2390
nope, unfortunately i'm not a C coder

[19-Nov-19 01:27 PM] turinglabs#2390
what is wasm?

[19-Nov-19 01:28 PM] turinglabs#2390
web assembly...?

[19-Nov-19 01:31 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, web assembly
We have nspv, which is a super lite client written in c
If it can be compiled to wasm, it is almost like a full node's functionality in a browser

[19-Nov-19 01:31 PM] Hember#5341
Would this "youtube tipbot" (I think in the end it could be used on any social media platform) be secure enough and could it be built on top of trusted projects like Metamask? I mean with is there any difference when it comes to coins, that one is more possible to build into Metamask than others?

[19-Nov-19 01:33 PM] turinglabs#2390
@gcharang i think that the hard stuff is sign transactions and if it works i've the code ready, just need to make some tests on the komodo blockchain

[19-Nov-19 01:35 PM] Hember#5341
ok

[19-Nov-19 01:35 PM] turinglabs#2390
@Hember we can build something that works LIKE metamask, i think that metamask is really close the ethereum ecosystem and it's not ready for this kind of cross chain functionalities. We can build something "secure enough" because we don't store data on a server and we don't store any kind of password. Encryption is always the AES-256 which is secure enough with strong passwords. I think we need to make the code open so anyone can contribute to these security stuff

[19-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Hember#5341
I am so sure that this would make a huge difference in adoption of Komodo tech as the brand would be known

[19-Nov-19 01:36 PM] Hember#5341
Okay, I see. üôÇ

[19-Nov-19 01:37 PM] turinglabs#2390

[19-Nov-19 05:03 PM] Hember#5341
@turinglabs , I came up with some ideas while walking in the nature a half an hour ago.

[19-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Hember#5341
So.. I was thinking about the "forced tip" that one could give to another although they aren't yet using the system. To really have a psychological impact this would be an important feature to have. But if there was such a "forced tip" I think it would also need to be a tip that returns to the sender if the person receiving the tip wouldn't collect it.
This is because it is possible that people try to tip big influencers, but those creators are millionaires. They would not collect the tip.
But to a person who gets a "big" tip from a subscriber giving him a days work of money, that would be a blessing. And the reaction in a content creators mind is to than that person giving the money.
Some projects are probably trying to use these millionaire influencers. That is why their product will die. Some people first think it is great to pay your idol yourself, but that is the only thing they will use it for - paying millionaires. These project do this because they do not already have a currency that is really worth something and valuable itself. But Komodo has, so the strategy can and should be diffetern.

[19-Nov-19 05:12 PM] Hember#5341
different*

[19-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Hember#5341
Now, I would love to be able to be the first, or one of the first people on the internet to make some donations and a video about this project. I myself would love to make another small but talented creators day. And I am sure as the word goes out again and again about how someone "just made my day/week/month/year" then the millionaires would start using it too to monetize their content further.

[19-Nov-19 05:17 PM] Hember#5341
But by this time there would be a community that understands the value of this product to have compassion to those creators in need, and this system would carry on developing. And surely in the end it might be possible to just add AtomicDEX to it and give the people the choice to use other currencies, too. But maybe making sure that when usin KMD (or another Komodo ecosystem coin) the transaction costs were the smallest.

[19-Nov-19 05:18 PM] Hember#5341
It might be nice if there was a referral link for the first people to market this product, too. Not so that everyone would have a referral, but just in the beginning to motivate tipping and publishing content about this product, and posting that referral in the midst.

[19-Nov-19 05:19 PM] Hember#5341
Some of these thoughts may be something that are apparent but I think it is better to say them than assume that people think about these things

[19-Nov-19 05:25 PM] turinglabs#2390
i think this is a second level of process, to tune the system we first need it working and realized, then we can try to understand how people will use this and how make it better. I think that if we create the system in a decentralized way there's no "return policy" because transactions are written in the blockchain..however we can try to create something that can minimize this loss of funds..

[19-Nov-19 05:26 PM] turinglabs#2390
i'm now trying to understand why the transactions are not accepted by my node üòÇ

[19-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Hember#5341
Yeah, I thought that this is the second step, but I thought it also might be useful to keep in mind from the start. As I don't know how coding works and how soon these things become important to realize.

[19-Nov-19 05:29 PM] Hember#5341
And if it feels that this is going to become something, I am here to come back to these thoughts, suggestions and strategies. In fact I feel like this is something where I could find my place to provide to Komodo... not just mindlessly shilling. üòÑ

[19-Nov-19 05:35 PM] sœÜldat#8733
I think we can set up a community fund for the development of this tipbot

There is this full stack developer looking for a position and he asked me if I could point to a direction and I did. There is a bounty that if you a refer a dev and he gets the position, the referrer gets 1777 KMD. I don't know how this works, but I can give the guys discord alias in case stuff happens.

[23-Nov-19 03:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@Hember ask him to mention that you referred him if he gets the position

Is there any interest in having Komodo be a sponsor or just reps go to CoinfestUK this upcoming April? I'm not sure who on the team handles event planning @Audo, but figured you'd be the guy to tag who would.
If we want to be a sponsor there's a discount currently.
