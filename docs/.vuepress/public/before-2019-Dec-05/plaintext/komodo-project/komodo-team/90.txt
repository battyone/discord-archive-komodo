Hello, last Saturday send the claim form of my stolen KMD in Agama wallet.  I also made the small transfer to my new address, as requested.  When will I receive my KMD tokens at the new address?  Thanks to the Komodo team.

Hi, I've written in the Agama wallet group and support community and I have not received a response.  That is why I am writing my question here: my KMD tokens were stolen on June 5 from the Agama wallet.  I have completed the form and sent the transfer you requested a week ago and I have not yet received the tokens at the new address.  Could you give me some information about it?  Thank you.

[20-Jul-19 06:55 AM] gcharang#6833
@Rave can you DM your old address?

Guys. The verification email of the composer.kmd,io does not arrive. Also not in spam. for about 15 minutes now. Can someone check if it is still working?

[21-Jul-19 03:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
For me it took an hour+ to arrive

[21-Jul-19 03:38 PM] barv#0867
ah, okay. Then I'll wait. It says 'a couple of minutes'. That is somewhat confusing

I like the new logo.And i read the documentation.It is indeed one of the best out there.But:If your team does not help good projects adopt the chain no much will happen.CMC=2360 projects=280 billion USD.First 20=230billion.The rest 50 billion/2340.Only the smart will survive.Select some real life projects and help adoption.

[22-Jul-19 04:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
you got any projects you think they should take a look at @Art.F ?

[22-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Art.F#5377
Sure.Real projects with real wealth creation.You have to set one good example.The rest will come.

Now when the rebrand is done, how do the team feel about it? Was it successful? Or did it not meet ur expectations of reaching out to ppl that kmd is not just a zec fork?

[25-Jul-19 03:03 PM] Markus#5464
If so, what went wrong and what could of been done differently?

[25-Jul-19 04:18 PM] Audo#5667
Hey @Markus 

Yes, we completed the rebrand and it was worth celebrating a little bit. Our message is now stronger and everyone who checks us out should better understand what we are looking to develop and what our vision is. All the pieces are now more alligned.

However, this is just the beginning and we can't just sit and expect things to magically happen. 

The goal now is to get more projects into our ecosystem.

`First documentation sprint is over, 100 pages of carefully written and endited content that is in a logical order.`
* We are now turning our focus on building educational journeys and tutorials to get people up to speed faster
`Two new products were relased, but they are in beta with limited functionality`
* We are working on finalizing their roadmaps and adding new features
`Atomic Swap Protocol is on a stable state and we get big swap success rate with our own AtomicDEX app`
* We have to release AtomicAPI and spread information about it to get other projects to adopt Komoso's atomic swap technology
`Antara Framework is relased and documentation is online`
* We have to craft together usecases that can be built today and form a marketing campaign around them, and get new businesses on board.
`Our community has grown and new people have found Komodo.`
* We have to offer better tools to empower the community and empower them to build the multi-chain ecosystem. We are looking to launch a community portal later.
* Who's building on Komodo? Where is this information? We are working on building an ecosystem dashboard to showcase the size and activity within our ecosystem.

@Audo thank you for taking time to write this all together, i appreciate it. Looking forward to see KMD evolve upcoming months and years ahead, i believe it will put more pressure on other projects to cook something KMD already didnt do or is already in the making üòÉ

Check especially the part of "Platform selection" in which 82% of banking and finance, 92% of healthcare, 84% of Insurance, 74% of manufacturing and logistics, and 86% of retail, said they had medium to high difficulty in choosing which blockchain platform to work on while collaborating with external partners

[01-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Regnar#6164
This is a good indicator that we need case studies using the Antara framework. Perhaps we can ask Komodo ecosystem projects that are in a particular industry to write or at least provide content for cases where they used them to solve a problem or to build business products

[01-Aug-19 05:40 PM] Regnar#6164
This would also be a good idea for community members who are in an industry IRL to chime in about how they might use Antara within their work or industry.
@Audo thoughts?

This recent study was technically already outdated when they wrote it, but it sketches a clear market that are likely to onboard the blockchain technology implementation.
