Grats on your second one!

[09-Jun-18 12:54 PM] ryan797#0000
Im headed out shortly but Reg, myself, Francesc, hansen and the rest of the crew will be glad to take up this torch I think.

[09-Jun-18 03:42 PM] yorklab#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A>, <@U9LUDEM8T>, I hope you can have a conversation with <@U6ZES59AA> and the team and collaborate on the best approach. 

I looked at many of the top coins and other lower ones that move up quick, and the common thread is they have partnerships/collaboration with the corporate world. 
Litecoin doesn’t have a big marketing team. Charlie spends his time finding a real use-case for his coin. He teams up with businesses that will use LTC.

When that happens with Komodo I think many of these marketing issues will seem trivial. In the meantime though it is good to keep tweaking the marketing efforts.

[09-Jun-18 08:26 PM] webalginet#0000
I apologize if the mcafee meme has not had good feedback for Komodo. I did it with good intention.

[09-Jun-18 08:26 PM] webalginet#0000
I also think that people who make negative comments do not understand too much of what they are talking about, and they are toxic people to my knowledge. But in this world there are people of all kinds.

[09-Jun-18 09:52 PM] westcoastsurf#0000
toxicity is allowing the repetition of mistakes

[09-Jun-18 09:52 PM] webalginet#0000
Finally mcafee has added the memes to the war.  https://iammcafee.com/content/site/Komodo.html

You obviously do not think promoting one of the biggest conmen in crypto is a mistake as well as tying it to komodo.

[09-Jun-18 11:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
Yeah I agree

[09-Jun-18 11:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
Let's stop engaging McAfee

[09-Jun-18 11:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
Unfortunately I've read many negative responses because the people who see this think it's the Komodo team pushing the memes.

[10-Jun-18 07:25 AM] cryptoon#0000
I dont mind

[10-Jun-18 07:25 AM] cryptoon#0000
There is not such thing as bad publicity

[10-Jun-18 07:25 AM] cryptoon#0000
The guys following mcaffee are a different crowd than the ones already invested in kmd

[10-Jun-18 07:26 AM] cryptoon#0000
So could be a way to get their attention

[10-Jun-18 07:26 AM] cryptoon#0000
But it’s up to the team I guess

[10-Jun-18 09:29 AM] westcoastsurf#0000
The only thing mcafee is doing here is repeatedly getting free work and publicity from naive people. Crypto twitter gobbles him up which is telling about their bias abilities. He knows it, he takes advantage of it. People blindly think these contests (which many many deluded companies do) are ok. People will never get paid for their time which could be have been used constructively instead. Mcafee gets marketing free or at very little cost.  "There is no such thing as bad publicity" is a trope though and untrue. No one can expect to be taken seriously by promoting themselves alongside the literal shitfest mcafee is. Aligning yourself and supporting negative things never turns out positive, at least I cannot think of any, can you?

[10-Jun-18 09:39 AM] cryptoon#0000
Just making a pic for a meme contest doesnt mean you are alligning with him

[10-Jun-18 03:21 PM] emmanux#0000
Echo chamber is not good either.

[10-Jun-18 03:21 PM] emmanux#0000
The community did it? let it be, it might have unexpected positive results.

[10-Jun-18 03:22 PM] emmanux#0000
Maybe just issue an official statement saying "we are so angry about this thing that the community did it..."

[10-Jun-18 03:23 PM] emmanux#0000
And just go on.

[10-Jun-18 03:24 PM] emmanux#0000
I mean, I despise the old geezer as much as you do, guys. But it's sometimes not about purism, but about numbers, and letting things flow.

[10-Jun-18 03:29 PM] emmanux#0000
That's the end of my rant about McAffee. 
About the other points I won't opine since I'm no expert.

Any thoughts on something KMD might be able to help with here?

[10-Jun-18 04:03 PM] regnar#0000
They are still up and coming and I don't think they allow for sending Coins out of the platform just yet, but you can buy with Fiat so it's definitely an avenue worth exploring

Here's my tweets to each coin. I couldn't send all of them messages with the info so I had to tweet to them publicly. Hopefully with enough likes and retweets they will see them and want to retweet or post it to their own followers too.

<@U4X7GDWT0> uploaded a file: https://komodo-platform.slack.com/files/U4X7GDWT0/FB4DSACTT/image.png and commented: by coin, some much more active than others, but overall not bad. That's over 3600 people who read Komodo, BarterDEX, Cross Chain Atomic Swaps, Trustless trading from your wallet. 3600 people who may be seeing that for the first time today, and now will associate those words with Komodo too.

[11-Jun-18 01:23 AM] regnar#0000
I'm going to modify this format a bit so it doesn't cut off the bottom when I tweet to coins. but considering it took me all of 10 minutes to swap out the logos and name for 6 coins, and then another 5 minutes to tweet them out. It might be worth doing in the future for supporting new coins on BarterDEX.

[11-Jun-18 01:25 AM] regnar#0000
So on new releases of BarterDEX where can I get the coins being listed before we release them? That way I can have them pre-made and post them here for other people to tweet out if I'm not around when it gets released. <@U6ZES59AA>

[11-Jun-18 01:51 AM] pondsea#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> we need to contact the communities twitter handle

[11-Jun-18 01:51 AM] pondsea#0000
And get them to tweet

[11-Jun-18 01:52 AM] pondsea#0000
That is the best wait to reach their community

[11-Jun-18 03:13 AM] regnar#0000
agreed <@U02PH4RHZ>. A lot of them don't allow you to message them, only tweet to them. So we need to find their actual CMO or social media custodian to contact them. all of which requires more prep time

[11-Jun-18 03:42 AM] pondsea#0000
I think we just need to find their op on bitcoin talk and dm them

[11-Jun-18 03:48 AM] regnar#0000
Yea that might work best, depends where they are most active I'd say. They may just have team members/emails listed on their websites (if they have one)

[11-Jun-18 03:49 AM] regnar#0000
but still, need to get info on the newest coins to be added prior to release so we can make the material and distribute to the coins. I think i remember BarterDEX updates being timed for two weeks?

TLDR: (I'm thinking...) Proper scaling requires maintaining Scaling, Security, and Privacy. Ditching one at the benefit of the other is easy but unacceptable.
Platforms that lock people into using a single coin may work short term, but no one wants to spend $5 to send a $1 transaction just because some game app is popular at the time.

[11-Jun-18 11:51 AM] regnar#0000
Sharding takes one large blockchain and breaks it into smaller shards, but KMD scales not by breaking one blockchain into smaller shards, but creating smaller independent chains that form a larger meta chain.

[11-Jun-18 11:53 AM] regnar#0000
Komodo is scaling by using actual time tested techniques and not overly reliant on bleeding edge tech that may or may not stand the test of time, and risk taking everyone's investments down with it.

[11-Jun-18 11:53 AM] stephenyork#0000

Notary Nodes do not create new blocks, they just agree upon a blockhash to be notarized, failure of the notary system would require +75% compromised nodes and would only disrupt the notarization process, not the blockchain itself.

[11-Jun-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
They dont HAVE to create new blocks. But they do mine most of them.

[11-Jun-18 12:01 PM] jl777#0000
of course, but that is independent process and there are GPU miners that are more than happy to mine all the blocks

[11-Jun-18 12:01 PM] stephenyork#0000
btw, all this awesome jl777 wisdom aggretation by <@U4X7GDWT0> should also be on komodo's own official homepage. right now it's all scattered on dozens or so channels. I seriously thing we should have a section on http://komodoplatform.com for specifically this kind of content with a "tag cloud" to make it somewhat searchable/browsable by subject of interest

probably it should be a continuous effort, with one subject per post

[11-Jun-18 12:08 PM] benohanlon#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> if you can research, verify, pull it all together and categorize it... that would be great. I also have listed the need for an 'origins story' for JL777 that explains where he's come from and what he's worked on... this could dovetail nicely.

[11-Jun-18 12:09 PM] regnar#0000
I've just been taking these informal Q&A and organizing them to make them look more formalized

[11-Jun-18 12:09 PM] stephenyork#0000
and on current homepage the readability is not so good, so (very) long posts are probably best avoided

[11-Jun-18 12:09 PM] benohanlon#0000
<@U9K42AHQW> the model is to use pillar / clusters. So one main posts that then links to ongoing content - which links back to the main.

[11-Jun-18 12:09 PM] regnar#0000
edit out excess comments unrelated, edit grammar, and group shorter texts into larger bodies

<@U4X7GDWT0> if you could work on this and produce something excellent - we can reward excellence.
