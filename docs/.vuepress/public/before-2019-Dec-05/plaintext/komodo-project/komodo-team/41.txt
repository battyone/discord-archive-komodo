[25-Aug-18 12:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I'd get a Komodo Tattoo if the community paid for it.  Old or new logo, Community choice.  @Regnar start a fund!  😛

[25-Aug-18 12:48 AM] Regnar#6164
Haha yea in my professional opinion, I'd advise against that lll

[25-Aug-18 12:48 AM] Regnar#6164
Lol

[25-Aug-18 12:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It would be small 2" max :)
In the history of tattoos, there have been worse decisions made.

[25-Aug-18 12:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But when KMD makes me a millionaire, I will have a memento for the old guard.   I'll throw a banner that says ❤JL777❤ in old english 😛

[25-Aug-18 12:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That may be too far actually 😛

[25-Aug-18 12:53 AM] Regnar#6164
Haha if KMD makes you a millionaire then go ahead and do whatever you want :)

Hey all! glad to see we won against Scroll in that twitter contest and it'll be onto the next one as soon as it's posted, but it has me thinking that Scroll may be a good project to reach out for coin migration to KMD. Currently it's erc20 but they seem to be using something they call a "hypernode protocol" which if I'm reading the white paper correctly, is a way to prioritize their traffic on Ethereum and increase the number "payments" in a tx. though I'm using our terms "payments" and "tx's" but I think it's very similar to how we can include multiple payments in a tx. 

Anyway, what are your thoughts on seeing if they would be interested in launching on KMD instead?

[27-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm always on the hunt for projects to migrate haha and especially if those projects are working on getting outside blockchain business, and it seemed they have an actual community (not voting bots). But I'd like to get all of your thoughts?

[27-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if they can work on and improve txs handling and adding other features on asset chain that would be awesome for the whole ecosystem

[27-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Regnar#6164
"We’re not Ethereum based, we’re providing the solution on a different network. The consensus mechanism is a fraction of what we intend to do, it is how we prioritize file traffic. Ultimately we want to replace relational databases, that is is long term objective but in the short term we are a new database option for businesses and offer new storage options for consumers. The vision is to get the 3rd party out of your data and give you back the ownership of all of your information."

[27-Aug-18 03:57 AM] Regnar#6164
sooo

[27-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Regnar#6164
lol not sure because "The Scroll Network is an upgrade to the Ethereum chain..." as per their whitepaper

[27-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Replacing relational databases with something new, I wonder what/how it would be

[27-Aug-18 03:59 AM] Regnar#6164
yea it's an interesting topic that I'm not well versed on, but considering how versatile the KMD chains are, I'm sure they can build on it 😉

[27-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
with smart contract , i think it would only be limited to their imagination

[27-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Slowly laying down and describing KMD asset chain features to them 😄

[27-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
That might entice them

[27-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Regnar#6164
haha yea I want to make sure it is a good fit for them too, knowing what they value most in a chain and then pitching KMD strengths in those

[28-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Regnar#6164
though a decentralized, cc driven version of this game would be awesome! https://www.bustabit.com/ I'd imagine the cc outcome is determined by the outcome of the "crash" machine, and having it all with micro transactions would be cool. however, I think the game would likely need a pool of money since everyone could technically "win" a game.

Hi..have you considered publishing KMD core tech about dPoW to a scientific journal?

[28-Aug-18 10:49 PM] shnu#0359
say IEEE..

[28-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Mylo#8306
can you link to specific publications please?   we have a maths paper on decentralized poker, shuffling etc.  which may be more suitable.   relating to  dPoW, i recently came across a comment with links to stats on the energy use for gold mining and how the inference made was that gold currently uses much more (2x-4x is being conservative) electricity than bitcoin alone.  if this is true and dPoW is used to secure an ecosystem of chains and contracts, it's v.v.v.v efficient for what it does (imo).

I will create a German blog about Komodo. Now I‘m looking for a domain. What do you mean what I should take? The DE-ending of course, but I need a second word next Komodo, because komodo.de is forgiven. komodoblog.de? komododeutschland.de? Just two examples...

Komodoplatform.de

I wonder if getting KMD on https://www.producthunt.com/ a good idea.

@Seko I think I read somewhere that even the world "Platform" could be changed by Ideas by Nature, not sure if it's true, but it might be best to prepare for that. perhaps something like Komodocoin.de KomodoKMD.de  Komodoblog.de KMDblog.de KMDforum.de Komodoforum.de or something?
