@sanoek60 the claim form if you completed one said there was currently no ETA on claims.

[06-Jun-19 04:45 AM] sanoek60#6801
Sorry what dos that mean ?

[06-Jun-19 04:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
It means we are working as hard as we can to return funds as soon as possible

[06-Jun-19 04:50 AM] sanoek60#6801
Great,many thanks and success ...

[06-Jun-19 08:27 AM] kpprabhu#9635
QT doesn't sync completely.

[06-Jun-19 08:27 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Is there any option to create addresses and move coins ?

[06-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@kpprabhu use verus agama

[06-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Create new adress in lite mode

[06-Jun-19 08:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@kpprabhu you can creat address and export privkey in QT without being at full sync - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024700-how-to-export-your-private-keys-from-the-komodo-ocean-wallet
use `getnewaddress` comand in debug console for new address

[06-Jun-19 08:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you wont see balance until synced tho

[06-Jun-19 08:48 AM] kpprabhu#9635
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator thanks

[06-Jun-19 08:48 AM] kpprabhu#9635
How to get the private key for created address  ?

[06-Jun-19 08:51 AM] kpprabhu#9635
To access the in other wallet interfaces..

[06-Jun-19 08:51 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Account..

[06-Jun-19 08:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Check the guide linked above

[06-Jun-19 08:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basically most/any RPC call can be used in the debug console window

[06-Jun-19 08:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`dumprivkey <your R-address>`

[06-Jun-19 09:01 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Is Ocean wallet safe to use ?

[06-Jun-19 09:01 AM] kpprabhu#9635
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominatorthanks

[06-Jun-19 09:06 AM] gcharang#6833
yes kpprabhu KomodoOcean is safe: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/folders/29000055193

[06-Jun-19 09:12 AM] kpprabhu#9635

[06-Jun-19 09:41 AM] kpprabhu#9635
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator on ocean wallet after importing private key. I don't find my chips coins when I try to send. Should syncing headers need to finish to send transactions.

[06-Jun-19 09:42 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah, will need full sync

[06-Jun-19 09:45 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Any files to make sync faster. Mine is syncing from 2016üòë

For Ocean Wallet

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] David11#9170
hello

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] David11#9170
i have made the kmd transfer to the versus agama wallet you suggested

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] David11#9170
what about the other tokens like bntn ?

[06-Jun-19 09:46 AM] David11#9170
what do i do about them ?

[06-Jun-19 09:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
transfer them too

[06-Jun-19 09:47 AM] David11#9170
this is a Headache

[06-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes

[06-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but a headache is better than if the hacker had stolen 8M KMD through the wallet exploit

[06-Jun-19 09:55 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Ocean wallet is not showing other assets in drop-down. How do we send other assets ?

[06-Jun-19 09:58 AM] gcharang#6833
@kpprabhu have you secured your KMD?

[06-Jun-19 10:05 AM] Acura#2748
So for clarify, i can move my kmd¬¥s via the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview May 29 2019 APP to my Ledger Nano, correct ?

[06-Jun-19 10:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@Acura yes

[06-Jun-19 10:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@Acura Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the untrusted versions of Agama

[06-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Acura#2748
Thx for quick feedback

[06-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Helly88#3715
When will a Trezor connection finally come? You can see what happens if you don't have a hardware wallet. On the Trezor page it says that there is no wallet from KMD yet. When can one count on it

I need to seriously give praise to the whole team for taking this rough situation, being on top of it, and getting a positive narrative out there about it.  You guys really have things airtight and I love seeing continued proof of it

[06-Jun-19 02:35 PM] designer#4893
Komodo's response was good, but it's not trustless. 
I think that this will allow some crazy person to arbitrarily move my assets in the future. 
this is a situation where you have to trust the Komodo team. 
this isn't right.

[06-Jun-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we only had access to the compromised keys

[06-Jun-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we were the firemen breaking down doors and rescuing people before the building burns down

[06-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the hacker had started stealing funds before we started sweeping, but in the chaos we were scrambling to get people to safety

[06-Jun-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
