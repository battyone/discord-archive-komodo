I personally think it would be a great feature in Agama. A little mail box in the corner, and it's really just a wallet that views all the messages that were sent to your address.

[01-Sep-18 01:56 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It would be great for all projects , I'll say 😄 , The main issue  is I think to make it easy to use.

[01-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Regnar#6164
yea a great feature of KMD AC too, seeing as they all have shared addresses, you could easily send messages to whales and ask if they want to be liquidity providers, warn addresses that accidentally fork off, make a community game like smart contract locked riddles posted on a message board, the right answer is the key to the wallet lol

[01-Sep-18 02:05 AM] Regnar#6164
hmm. The riddle should be something that forces people to look into Komodo tech

[01-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, it will be educational and rewarding as well

[01-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Regnar#6164
yes!

[01-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
depending on the size of the pot of course 😄

[01-Sep-18 05:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Just to give everyone in here the heads up, Gordon Komodo and I just spent the past 3 hours creating a completely custom Seed phrase. We've been contacting various KMD AC projects and searching their pages/documents/information to find a word to use for part of the seed. Each word doesn't have to be/or isn't at all related to crypto or even Komodo (this was so normal words could be used and not easily guessed/brute forced with Komodo key words). and we have some directions to find the word in the resources. something like "Bitcoin/bible/48th word"  which could be interpreted as the 48th word of the Bitcoin White Paper. easy. But not all will be that easy.

We've also gotten commitments from two projects so far to donate coins to the seed wallet which should really up the pot. We are waiting on a few other projects as well and because there is some decent coinage here we did NOT want to make this TOO easy. We are still working out the clues/directions to see if they are too easy/hard but that will be determined later. 

The words locations are picked strategically to get as many eyes on Komodo tech, resources, the AC's, channels, etc. 

Ideally we think that before this goes live we can create some simple posters, and tease the wallet balance on twitter as a "Seed Scavenger Hunt" or something. We were going to do riddles, But this seems like a better way because the winner just needs to be able to interpret the clues, find the location, and find the word. It would probably be much better to have the official twitter blast this out when it's time so that we get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible. Another criteria we were thinking was to release the first 6 clues immediately, and when retweets hit a certain point, we release the rest. this way we create an incentive for contestants to actually spread the word. 


Thoughts?

How bigs the pool in usd by the end of it you reckon? Not that I’m smart enough to crack it HAHA but might donate some in if it’s not too big

[01-Sep-18 05:43 AM] Regnar#6164
Another thought was to add a 13th word/string as a safety so that the first person to show the correct seed gets the 13th word to get into the wallet, that way when there isn't a bunch of people snagging coins with the same seed when they are trying to move them out. OR we just let it be a free for all lol

[01-Sep-18 05:44 AM] Regnar#6164
No idea right now tbh. we have two commitments which is much more than I thought we'd get just asking, especially because a lot of people are sleeping haha

[01-Sep-18 05:44 AM] Regnar#6164
but it is looking good so far

lol honestly, why not

[01-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Regnar#6164
It might be a good idea to have a much longer seed phrase, like the true seed be 24-36 words, and we just give out the first 12 as clues

[01-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Regnar#6164
just so if the person decides they don't feel like moving all these coins haha they will be safe in the wallet

[01-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Regnar#6164
idk, up for debate

Would be cool to have a bit of every asset chain coin in the reward 😁

[01-Sep-18 05:50 AM] Regnar#6164
Sharing the same wallet address helps!

[01-Sep-18 05:50 AM] Regnar#6164
makes moving the coins for the winner easier.

[01-Sep-18 05:51 AM] Regnar#6164
not sure if Verus, STAKED, or PIRATE have same addresses. Pirate is I think all Z address

[01-Sep-18 05:51 AM] Deleted User#0000

Okay I'm going to go to sleep. I'll be gone most of tomorrow, but maybe early in the morning I'll be on to work on this, I see no reason to try and rush this, if we have a proper competition it could drum up some nice joint community support and awareness

[01-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Much appreciated jl

[01-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Regnar#6164
So if I'm reading this right, I should be looking for the "notarized hash" in the "btc_txid"?

[01-Sep-18 03:15 PM] Regnar#6164
So looks like we have commits for 6 different types of coins to be in the custom seed! should be a lot of fun :D
I think because of the variability in the wallets required (PIRATE needs z address and full node, and Verus isn't in KMD agama, but only Verus Agama) it will be very difficult for the first person to solve all the clues to move all the coins to a safe wallet before someone snatches part of the prize.

This could be part of the game, or we go with a winner takes all style. And this would have us build an actual 24-36 word seed, and only release the first 12 words. the person who finds the first 12 words of the seed and tells us, will receive the rest of the seed and can take their time removing coins or w.e.

Thoughts?

[01-Sep-18 03:57 PM] jspook16#3059
i would think that a person that believes they have solved it would keep the "seed" private (to themselves), try to login and see if it is the correct one without it going public.  Or am i missing something

[01-Sep-18 03:57 PM] jspook16#3059
we  would know the riddle was solved when the funds move

[01-Sep-18 03:58 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea that was the original idea

[01-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Regnar#6164
I think the problem is that there are a lot of different coins, and they aren't all supported in Agama. So it would be hard to move all the coins out of the exposed address quickly. so for example PIRATE has been chipped in, but that coin ONLY works in Z addresses and needs a full blockchain download. Which makes it not easy to access that wallet. So while multiple people may solve the seed, and the fastest starts removing coins, they may not get all the coins because someone else might take PIRATE, or Verus (which is in a different version of Agama)

[01-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Regnar#6164
Then again that could be the point. that there can be multiple winners and the fastest wins

[01-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Regnar#6164
or we do winner takes all

[01-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Regnar#6164
It's included as part of the fun. Not because it has any value

[01-Sep-18 04:04 PM] jspook16#3059
I think having multiple winners can be good for the following reasons. If person A solves the riddle, he is now on time crunch to move the different coins using the different wallets. So solving it does not gaurantee all (or any for that matter) coins and the urgency usually leads to quickly learning to do something that you might not be familiar with

[01-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I kinda agree jspook

[01-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Regnar#6164
plus it is less effort on our part, I don't have to monitor my twitter and find the first person to send me a message, verify the seed, etc

[01-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Regnar#6164
@Gordon Komodo  what do you think?

[01-Sep-18 04:07 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah its "less" controlled by you guys too. If a person is serious about it, when the address goes public, they would get familiar with the different wallets needed based on the coins in the address. Just my thoughts

[01-Sep-18 04:07 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that will be easier on our part

[01-Sep-18 04:08 PM] jspook16#3059
I think thats where the real value is, getting people to interact with the different wallets and actually make z transactions if they have to.

[01-Sep-18 04:09 PM] jspook16#3059
Either way its a really good idea

[01-Sep-18 04:10 PM] jspook16#3059
Maybe in the future, a cc contract and some AI can take the human factor out of creating the seed. (Basically an AI created riddle)

[01-Sep-18 04:11 PM] Regnar#6164
haha yea you'd be surprised how tedious it is

[01-Sep-18 04:11 PM] Regnar#6164
at least this way.

[01-Sep-18 04:11 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah you have to put it together then test to make sure it can be solved im guessing

[01-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Regnar#6164
We are picking words that force people to look through information about komodo, apps, AC, whitepapers, blogs, pretty much anything. and are really creative in picking the words. It's not as easy as "Komodo uses what mining algo" or anything. There is some effort, which is why I think fastest wins

[01-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Regnar#6164
and then having to make directions to find what is oftentimes a normal word, and then figure out how to make it a bit trickier while still solveable

[01-Sep-18 04:13 PM] jspook16#3059
lol yeah i can imagine. I hope something related to jumblr makes it in

[01-Sep-18 04:13 PM] jspook16#3059
