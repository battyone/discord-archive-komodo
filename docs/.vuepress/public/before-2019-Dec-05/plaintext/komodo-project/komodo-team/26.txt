Soo... CoinDesk just posted this article: https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-exchange-crypto-dex/

"DEX" is a hot buzzword in crypto trading, but the current models actually offer a spectrum of technologies with varying degrees of centralization.

Not a single mention of Komodo or BarterDEX

[23-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Would be great if we could get some folks drawing attention to misreporting here. I Tweeted at CoinDesk and emailed the woman who wrote the article, hopefully we can set the record straight

Looking at stateofthedapps.com I'm not too impressed

[24-Jul-18 01:22 AM] RAE#3178
Could we get an update on where Komodo 2.0 is at?

[24-Jul-18 01:23 AM] RAE#3178
Seems also rare to here about Bitcoin Benny, is he still involved with Komodo?

[24-Jul-18 01:37 AM] Steve Lee#1967
Komodo 2.0 is being tested. We are working on an updated technical roadmap which should give you a clearer picture of 2.0 and beyond.

Benny is still involved, and is currently in Japan pitching to potential partners/investors.

@Steve Lee Thanks Steve for the reply, very much appreciated. 
Are there any previews of the re-brand available?

[24-Jul-18 02:46 AM] Nitego#6721
@Daniel CP the objective was to sell the exchanges that paid for the advert directly or indirectly. If they mentioned BarterDex or anyone platform that actually works it defeats their purpose  ( make the DEX look terrible to the reader so they believe Coinbase and Kraken is the best they have)

Just a thought, I'm by no means a marketing expert but I've noticed that in the other asset chains that simple games and airdrops bring a ton of people into the community. Like @benohanlon mentioned micro bounties for spreading the word and  after the inital "fun and givaways" I think KMD  would spread like wildfire. HyperDEX is a "everyone else" app that literally anyone can do (I'll have intro docs ready) that we can expand on a new base, not just the crypto savvy base. Again, just a thought

Tone Vays works for  Cointelegraph It's not surprising they never mention komodo or BarterDEX/HyperDEX

Why cointelegraph hates Komodo? What happened?

[24-Jul-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
other way. tone vays hates anything that isnt bitcoin, komodo isnt bitcoin, tone hates komodo, tone works at cointelegraph

Yeah but Other dex all the  time mentionedü§î so Whats wrong with the Guy? Maybe a good Komodo writer hire to cointelegraph and make some good article about Komodo :-)

[24-Jul-18 02:23 PM] joe2x4#5987
Seems that our strategy is a defensive one. Many articles, blogs, tweets either fail to mention or incorrectly mention kmd. We defend with correct info. Maybe at some point the strategy should change to offense. Ie: a crypto challenge or a crypto throw down. Make the other projects go on the defensive. Or when a scaling test is done, make a big deal about it.  Advertise the coming achievement and deliver it to the masses with a little fanfare.

Have we stopped trying to get Trezor integration? Ledger has obviously been nothing but problems, and I remember from a while back Stick was pretty receptive to the idea and he knows some Komodo Devs? Maybe we should set up a twitter blast to randomly target some of their tweets with Komodo integration comments, likes, retweets. Could potentially focus on the fact Ledger hasn't resolved core issues we need for too long and they'd likely make a lot more sales of KMD holders moving from ledger (like me) though this may appear adversarial, I think we've given Ledger enough time to correct this issue. 

@benohanlon @Steve Lee  What do you think? are we ready to help them integrate if they need assistance?

[24-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Regnar#6164
specifically the integration of a claim now button, and viewing of nlocktime which I believe is the issue with Ledger.

[24-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Mylo#8306
yes keep it on the to-do list, something will have to happen - just wait for response from team.

[24-Jul-18 07:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@RunningMantheCoin so the answer is top 10 non-exchange addresses hold ~25% of KMD as far as we know but it's probably rounded up because the list very likely still includes other exchanges addresses, just not sure which ones

[24-Jul-18 07:34 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
Awesome, thanks @KomodoWorld  & @jl777c

[24-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So 10M kmd is locked up in funds? I can imagine they wont move very soon?

[24-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Well not locked up

[24-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But invested by

[24-Jul-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I think it makes sense to count the SuperNET and MSHARK KMD like exchange held, just longer term

[24-Jul-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so not sure how you calculate 25% of the top 10

[24-Jul-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems less than 10%

[24-Jul-18 07:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok, excluding SN and Mshark it's far lower

[24-Jul-18 07:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
let me recount

[24-Jul-18 07:43 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
~12.9% of current supply, and still likely including one or more minor exchanges

@RunningMantheCoin

this? https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

[24-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I would not count mshark and supernet not as free float, not reallye exchange like

[24-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Exchange are a lot of users

[24-Jul-18 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The funds are like short term ‚Äòdead‚Äô coins

[24-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If dont count them in the free float then it might be easier for people to understand as they can compare it to shares

[24-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kind of like when a big family holding holds a large portion of a publicly traded company

[24-Jul-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is far closer to exchange holdings than a single whale holdings

[24-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm because the funds are held by a lot of people

[24-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also makes sense

[24-Jul-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
