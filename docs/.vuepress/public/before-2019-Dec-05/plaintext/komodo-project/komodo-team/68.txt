If you guys would prefer us to rush through the rebrand and do a shitty job, I''m sorry

[11-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We aren't going to do that

[11-Jan-19 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
seriously?

[11-Jan-19 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
that's your argument

[11-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX at this point you're just trolling.

[11-Jan-19 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
I honestly think that it's getting to the point that if we want something done for Komodo, we have to do it ourselves.

[11-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Wonderful

[11-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Komodo is a decentralized, open source project

[11-Jan-19 03:23 PM] Daniel CP#2020
we welcome all contributions

[11-Jan-19 03:23 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes with investors

[11-Jan-19 03:24 PM] PTYX#6840
and the team in charge of public image isn't communicating anything or willing to answer valid questions. Even going as far as acting there was no date insinuated for the rebrand

[11-Jan-19 03:24 PM] Daniel CP#2020
What questions have not been answered?

[11-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And you still haven't shown me Komodo comms that committed to Dec 2018

[11-Jan-19 03:25 PM] PTYX#6840
I have a few questions actually. how much has been spent on this rebrand?

[11-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't know tbh

[11-Jan-19 03:25 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not my role

[11-Jan-19 03:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Aside from the cost of time that we already know, it would be interesting to see how much was spent in these past 6 months of planning

[11-Jan-19 03:26 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay instead of assuming what you both actually want to say here, @PTYX what is your suggestion we actually do?

[11-Jan-19 03:26 PM] PTYX#6840
We need a firm deadline on the rebrand and certain actions from the marketing team

[11-Jan-19 03:26 PM] PTYX#6840
if they are not met, we should look for another solution.

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Daniel CP#2020
"certain actions"?

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
yes

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not sure what that means

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
for starters Benny

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
what is he?

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Regnar#6164
What about milestones that the rebrand needs to go through, would deadlines on those be suitable?

[11-Jan-19 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
is he the Komodo manger, ceo, just a volunteer?

[11-Jan-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
is he running redfox labs now too?

[11-Jan-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
what are his responsibilities and how do we hold people in their position accountable?

[11-Jan-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
right now we have no way to quantify how much is being spent and what is actually being delivered.

[11-Jan-19 03:29 PM] Daniel CP#2020
To my knowledge, Benny is a volunteer

[11-Jan-19 03:29 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I could be wrong

[11-Jan-19 03:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Well, all those details need to be cleared up

[11-Jan-19 03:30 PM] Daniel CP#2020
As for milestones, @Regnar i think that's something we can work on

[11-Jan-19 03:30 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I will talk to Steve and Ben, i think we need to do an AMA

[11-Jan-19 03:30 PM] PTYX#6840
If this is supposed to be a professional project it needs to begin setting professional boundaries and guidelines. Right now it's like everyone is working on their own thing and not communicating anything to the community.

[11-Jan-19 03:30 PM] Daniel CP#2020
About marketing and rebrand

[11-Jan-19 03:31 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't know what I can say publicly right now and I dont want to say a bunch of things that are meant to be internal

[11-Jan-19 03:31 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX it seems like many of your questions are not about marketing or the rebrand, I'm not in a position to answer them

[11-Jan-19 03:32 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm talking about marketing and the business side.

[11-Jan-19 03:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I think there should be some milestones established. "finished rebrand" imo is too large/opaque. what does rebrand mean? new logo? new front facing UI? does Komodo create a foundation to focus on business? coming up with business plan? What is the goal of rebranding, to drive value for KMD? establishing new target market? new market positioning? etc.

Because it's the end result, it's expected to be longer away in the future, with a lot of time in between of uncertainty and guesses/rumors. Milestones will at least give investors a way to track progress and know things are being done.

What other actionable things would we want to see more from marketing?

[11-Jan-19 03:36 PM] PTYX#6840
I agree, part of a rebrand or any development is the scope of work

[11-Jan-19 03:37 PM] PTYX#6840
that needs to be made clear with deadlines for each individual milestone of this rebrand

[11-Jan-19 03:37 PM] PTYX#6840
I would say communication from management

[11-Jan-19 03:37 PM] PTYX#6840
I want to see videos with Steve and Benny talking about Komodo, the weekly or biweekly progress

[11-Jan-19 03:37 PM] PTYX#6840
or whoever is meant to be the leadership at the time

[11-Jan-19 03:38 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't think the team has internal metrics but if Benny is a volunteer and he is representing komodo, we as a community should be able to gauge his contribution and decide if we should look for other volunteers

[11-Jan-19 03:39 PM] PTYX#6840
So I think we should specify the responsibilities of any volunteers within the leadership team.

[11-Jan-19 03:39 PM] PTYX#6840
As I see it right now, benny looks more like he is from Redfox than from Komodo. So from an outsider's point of view it can be confusing.

[11-Jan-19 03:43 PM] designer#4893
sadly, feel the limitations and fantasies of being decentralized while watching this conversation... and feel the need for centralization.

[11-Jan-19 03:43 PM] PTYX#6840
Marketing Wishlist
- Weekly or Biweekly communication videos from leadership
- Scope of Responsibilities of the Leadership memebers
- Scope of work for rebrand
- Deadline for rebrand milestones
- Annual review of volunteers and possible election of new candidates.

[11-Jan-19 03:44 PM] PTYX#6840
@designercentralization and organization aren't mutually exclusive

[11-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Daniel CP#2020
--> "What other actionable things would we want to see more from marketing?"

This is the most important question in my mind. Thanks @Regnar

Actionable suggestions are 100% welcomed and we will execute on everything we can to help push Komodo forward

[11-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX thanks for that list.

[11-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Daniel CP#2020
All very reasonable requests

[11-Jan-19 03:47 PM] Regnar#6164
@designer trust me, this is the same type of stuff you see in many companies. lol

[11-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I've brought up the idea of an AMA with Steve and Ben. It seems like the plan was to release the year-end report and hold an AMA about that, as well as the plan for 2019

[11-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
So all rebrand questions can be brought up in that

[11-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We will announce dates ASAP

[11-Jan-19 03:50 PM] PTYX#6840
recently nem held an election to replace their entire leadership team. The community voted in the team they wanted to represent them for the next 2 years. pretty neat system.

[11-Jan-19 03:50 PM] Regnar#6164
I think along with Scope of responsibilities would be a list of Komodo resources and who currently has control/ownership of them. Simply to make it easier for us to respond to bugs and issues that are brought to our attention. for example, if there is a spelling error on Komodoplatform.com who do I tag to get it fixed? Or a Komodo explorer is down, who owns which one (if they are team members)

[11-Jan-19 03:51 PM] PTYX#6840
There was alot of hate from some of the candidates and it was similar to a political campaign

[11-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I guess I can give a somewhat vague update re: rebrand. 

The new logo is done. New typeface, new colors, new logo, new everything. IBN was working on the wallet and well into the design process. We've actually paused that temporarily because there may be a change of plans. We might shift to the blockchain generator instead, which would mean IBN would design that for us rather than a new wallet. There are already several good wallets in the ecosystem so we're trying to work out if it makes sense to continue progress with the wallet or shift gears. The blockchain generator would ideally (not a guarantee and I cannot offer timelines) be hosted on AWS, which would allow self-service model for people to launch a customized blockchain with just a few clicks. None of this is certain yet.

We're also working on new messaging (which has been a work in progress for months now, with everything from the 4 pillars of blockchain tech to the new architecture narrative we created). We're working on the wireframes and copy for the new website, which will incorporate all of the new messaging and visual identity.

We're  hoping to launch all of this at the end of Feb or early March. These dates are subject to change.

[11-Jan-19 03:55 PM] PTYX#6840
I thought we didn't want to do things half assed

[11-Jan-19 03:55 PM] PTYX#6840
:trollface:

[11-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Daniel CP#2020
What's being half asses PTY?

[11-Jan-19 03:55 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm teasing

[11-Jan-19 03:56 PM] PTYX#6840
let's make the  proper report though

[11-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We're finalizing a year-end report (a team-wide report but will include marketing info), as well as a dPOW brochure, a blockchain starter kit brochure, a dPoW video, and a pitch deck

[11-Jan-19 03:57 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We're working on all of this

{Reactions}

[11-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar feel free to tag me or DM if you see stuff that needs fixing. Even if I can't do it myself, I can find out who can and pass the request along

[11-Jan-19 04:03 PM] tolken#2655
As far as marketing is concerned, I can‚Äôt remember who mentioned it, maybe PTYX. But the recent promotion of Veriblock, offering something that sounds similar to dPoW is an indication that‚Äôs there‚Äôs more room to get the word out on kmd‚Äôs dPoW. It‚Äôs a hot topic right now and perhaps could benefit from a very focused marketing pitch independent of the rest of kmd.

[11-Jan-19 04:05 PM] tolken#2655
All of the discussions that jl777 has been having with various critics is a good angle, but perhaps a bigger marketing pitch for the masses would be beneficial to pressure other projects to at least take a closer look.

[11-Jan-19 04:05 PM] tolken#2655
the average Joe out there may not understand how dPoW works, but if everyone is talking about it; they‚Äôre eventually going to want it.

[11-Jan-19 04:06 PM] PTYX#6840
we're working on our own dpow page by the way

[11-Jan-19 04:07 PM] tolken#2655
Btw, can anyone explain how Magnum Ledger fix came out of nowhere? Is that @lukechilds ‚Äòs Ledger fix or something else?

[11-Jan-19 04:07 PM] Regnar#6164
"We might shift to the blockchain generator instead, which would mean IBN would design that for us rather than a new wallet."
What is the overall goal of this rebrand? Obviously to increase KMD value, but what is the established method of doing that? Wallets cater mostly to crypto users, which could drive value. While blockchain generation can drive value by creating more users (variety of users too) as well as dPoW, MM fees, etc. bring in more devs to create better wallets, exchange UI, etc. 
If we think like a business, we build products like wallets, if we think like a platform, we build a platform that lets others build products. I'm a fan of the latter.
What does Komodo see as the best method of creating value for KMD and the ecosystem, and will this rebrand position us to actual do that?

[11-Jan-19 04:08 PM] PTYX#6840
@tolken magnum is a wallet that came from the Guarda team

[11-Jan-19 04:08 PM] PTYX#6840
They split up and created mangum

[11-Jan-19 04:09 PM] tolken#2655
So this is Lukechilds fix that has been in works for a while?

[11-Jan-19 04:09 PM] PTYX#6840
Luke fixed the ledger's issue with being able to make a transaction that sets the nlocktime. He pushed that update to the ledger github and it was accepted.

[11-Jan-19 04:10 PM] PTYX#6840
So anyone using ledger on Komodo and is able to claim will do so thanks to luke's update

[11-Jan-19 04:11 PM] tolken#2655
Oh I thought it was some weird work around. So with the Ledger update, can you just send from and to your Ledger, like you do on Agama?

[11-Jan-19 04:11 PM] PTYX#6840
yes

[11-Jan-19 04:12 PM] PTYX#6840
you can't use the claim function yet on magnum because sapling broke functinality

[11-Jan-19 04:12 PM] PTYX#6840
but it was working

[11-Jan-19 04:12 PM] PTYX#6840
for now, if you update your komodo app on ledger and use it on magnum you will be able to make normal txs

[11-Jan-19 04:14 PM] tolken#2655
How‚Äôs your Chameleon going?

[11-Jan-19 04:14 PM] tolken#2655
Thanks for info

[11-Jan-19 04:14 PM] PTYX#6840
We are preparing the closed beta today

[11-Jan-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
once we test that i'll make a decision if we release it publically or wait for the next release

[11-Jan-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
did you see the demo?

[11-Jan-19 04:15 PM] tolken#2655
I only saw some early concept images, looked sweet.

[11-Jan-19 04:18 PM] tolken#2655
Nice, looks sexy - I like the look and feel, the mornin graphics etc

[11-Jan-19 04:19 PM] tolken#2655
Does it or will it ever have Ledger integration?

[11-Jan-19 04:20 PM] PTYX#6840
for the desktop version definitely
