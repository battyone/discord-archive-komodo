Not to mention the website, but also announced offices spaces, parternerships, and other news about redfox at the same time that the rebrand was announced in August

[11-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not sure what the suggestion is. Redfox.io is just a one-pager so it makes sense that it could be put together quickly

[11-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Feb 23 will be six months

[11-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020
If we have stuff that you can help with, I'll be sure to reach out @PTYX . Thanks

[11-Jan-19 02:48 PM] PTYX#6840
My suggestion is that it has taken too long. Even people within the team are lauching websites faster than the team itself.

[11-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Daniel CP#2020
OK i hear you. I understand that you feel this has taken too long

[11-Jan-19 02:49 PM] PTYX#6840
why has it taken this long?

[11-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We were expecting it to take this long from the get go

[11-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We never made any promises about dates, this was the plan all along

[11-Jan-19 02:50 PM] PTYX#6840
oh ok

[11-Jan-19 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
but then why was the date fixed for december? if there was never a deadline for  december?

[11-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Daniel CP#2020
There's a lot going on behind the scenes, we're trying to get the messaging just right, Sidd and Mylo are working on a developer portal that will be integrated into the website, and we're now looking to finish the blockchain generator web app for the rebrand too

[11-Jan-19 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
interesting

[11-Jan-19 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
what all is going on behind the scenes?

[11-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Where do you see a fixed date for Dec?

[11-Jan-19 02:52 PM] PTYX#6840
sounds interesting

[11-Jan-19 02:53 PM] PTYX#6840
it would be great to talk about these things happening in the background. as a komodo investor, community member, and service provider the more information the better.

[11-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll see if we can arrange an AMA about all this

[11-Jan-19 02:53 PM] PTYX#6840
We can pretend like the date wasn't set but it was definitely insinuated and people picked up on that.

[11-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'm not sure what is meant to be kept internal at the moment

[11-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Regnar#6164
@Daniel CP is there going to be a significant difference or eventual merging of <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/> and <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/> They seem to have some differences but a lot of overlap.

[11-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar that is a question that @Mylo and @Bryan_Beus will be able to answer far better than I can

Rebrand info is here on Komodo's Youtube page:
<https://coinpaprika.com/event/58735-full-rebrand-20/>   
2018 marketing review and goals:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RDgtFKf0JI23othrPVvZ45miSLwhTmxX/view>  

I understand rebrands take time, and I'm not discussing how long it is taking, or when it should be done, just that the communication put out about it hasn't been consistent, or at least has been consistent up until the end of Q4 2018.

[11-Jan-19 03:00 PM] designer#4893
I just think Komodo needs a bit of business mind. 
even a very good innovation is meaningless if it is not presented as a business. 
komodo needs careful strategy and planning.
all weapons should not be shown at once, but komodo seems powerless to captivate the public.

[11-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I hear you @Regnar but to be fair that marketing report was made in Jan 2018, long before we ever had plans to work with IBN

[11-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We've tried to be consistent as possible but the truth is we were thinking Q1 2019 all along

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We never committed to dates b/c we know there are always unforeseen events and challenges

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Meyse#0952
I've been following this rebrand from here but there was really never ever any date set. That 31dec came out of thin air, nobody from the team ever mentioned that on discord

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] PTYX#6840
that's possibly the error

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] PTYX#6840
dates and deadlines need to be met as with any business

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] Daniel CP#2020
A lot of what we're waiting on too is establishing revenue models

[11-Jan-19 03:03 PM] PTYX#6840
they can be adjusted sure, but they are there for a reason

[11-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We need to figure out how to keep Komodo afloat and once we establish that, then we can create marketing strategy

[11-Jan-19 03:05 PM] PTYX#6840
Ok, so the priority now is to keep Komodo afloat?

[11-Jan-19 03:05 PM] PTYX#6840
That is why the marketing strategy hasn't been put in place yet?

[11-Jan-19 03:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Agreed, it is bound to have changes, but changes would be best to be communicated, or at least the information updated. That video is Komodo's official youtube but we don't see anything about where the rebrand is now, even if it is pushed back for good reason. in fact we haven't had a new video there in 6 months haha

[11-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We're working on a lot of different things at once. It's probably easy to think the rebrand is limited to the 4 or 5 guys on the marketing tram but it's not. It's a team wide rebrand and a complete overhaul of Komodo. Audo mentioned this not too long ago, I think he explained it very well

[11-Jan-19 03:06 PM] PTYX#6840
I disagree here

[11-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar we have no funding for videos. Maybe we could start a community fundraising project to make videos

[11-Jan-19 03:07 PM] PTYX#6840
This rebrand could have been done in a month or two with a focuses team like the one we have for design and web development.

[11-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX it could have been done very very poorly in a month or two

[11-Jan-19 03:07 PM] PTYX#6840
@Daniel CP there is no funding for a team member to get in front of a camera?

[11-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We want professional quality marketing

[11-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Meyse#0952
A rebrand really can't be done in a few months... This really takes a long time with testing etc etc. You oversimplify big time here

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not people recording themselves with a cell phone

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] PTYX#6840
our team doesn't spend 6 months planning

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Daniel CP#2020
That's great @PTYX . You guys can run your team in the way that you see fit

[11-Jan-19 03:08 PM] Meyse#0952
If you want the best results you need more then just work fast

I've offered my help

[11-Jan-19 03:09 PM] PTYX#6840
and the chainzilla community is fully behind komodo

[11-Jan-19 03:09 PM] Regnar#6164
Not to argue the point too much but there is a deliverables timeline on the 2018 marketing strategy I linked here. Again, I'm in the camp of dates not being set on fairly opaque goals such as rebrands. Just saying the communication needs to be updated more frequently when we have in the past set timelines. But that's all I'll say on that, it's in the past, we aren't setting dates in the future, which is the right answer.

[11-Jan-19 03:09 PM] PTYX#6840
there were some deadlines that werent met for sure.

[11-Jan-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one of my friends was raging at me the other night about some rebrand in december that I had never heard of... not sure where that came from.... But he was mega angry about it.

[11-Jan-19 03:10 PM] PTYX#6840
@blackjok3r it was insinuated that it would come in december and those event sites picked up on it

[11-Jan-19 03:10 PM] PTYX#6840
basically it was registered as a major event for komodo

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Can someone please show me where Komodo said December?

[11-Jan-19 03:11 PM] PTYX#6840
@Daniel CP we have run chainzilla how we see fit. that's why we have gotten so many thing done. Including the Agama redesign

It was never insinuated that it was dec @PTYX , really. Some community member probably made that up in their own head and then put in on calmarketcap and then it led its own life

Okay but lets be real here, there WAS a date set in some of Komodo communications (those communications are cited in links here). That date was set prematurely in early 2018, we failed to update people that there was going to be delays, delays for good reason or not, now we are here with rebrand still in planning/implementation. Rebranding is obviously going to take time since it isn't just changing a website, it's about changing how we are perceived and who our target market is. 
There is no point in arguing whether we set a date or not, we did. it's cited. What we should be discussing is what do we do next, or while the rebrand is happening

[11-Jan-19 03:18 PM] Regnar#6164
We already know not to set dates in the future for opaque goals. Launching a new website is not opaque, but that isn't what is really being discussed here. Rebrands are opaque, and the right answer is not to set a date. That should be settled, and doesn't need belaboring.

[11-Jan-19 03:19 PM] PTYX#6840
what is a rebrand though? it's not that opaque.

[11-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
OK even is I agree for the sake of argument that we did say Dec 2018, I'm not sure I understand the concerns are here

[11-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Regnar#6164
a clear date in which one is "accomplished" is definitely opaque

[11-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We can def improve communications. I hear that point and agree

[11-Jan-19 03:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
But what is the urgency here? Why should we rush through a major rebrand?
