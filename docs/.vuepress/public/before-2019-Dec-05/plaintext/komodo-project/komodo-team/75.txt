#SparksPay has completed integration of $KMD dPoW in the $SPK codebase, which will help secure the network against future attacks. Testing will begin soon on the Komodo testnet. Your #masternodes and #Guardian nodes will be #SAFU :) https://t.co/T4wNrpeQSa

```Which of these products and improvements should our developers prioritize?

ProtonMail improvements
ProtonVPN improvements
Encrypted calendar
Encrypted file storage
*Blockchain services such as a cryptocurrency wallet*
Encrypted notes
Encrypted password manager```

This was on a Protonmail survey, I'm pretty sure we already reach out to them (as probably a lot of other projects do) but there may be a multicoin wallet we can offer, as well as of course pushing them to acknowledge dPoW notarizations and some ecosystem projects.

looks like Coinpaprika is making a mobile app/wallet with built in exchange.

[18-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm talking with them on Twitter to see if they would be interested in checking out the mobile DEX and mm2 backend. their goal is ```"we want to make it possible for everybody to purchase any coin that is available on coinpaprika, it will take some time, but we're sure we'll accomplish it!"``` which means wallet integration and buying

[18-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't see how they will accomplish this with traditional exchanges or 3rd parties like shapeshift etc. because they have 2430 coins listed on their site... probably a thousand or more that aren't supported by those services

Hey just a thought, but we may need an article showing the differences between building games and NFTs with Komodo vs building them with things like Counterparty.
Also I do like the Counterparty explorer especially their API documentation on it. https://xchain.io/

[19-Mar-19 02:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar tbh, reviews by independent bloggers would be better; else you get "biased" articles. Komodo has amazing features, yet the gaming part isn't super easy to onboard.... yet

[19-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea definitely, I'm thinking more like what Pirate does. It's pretty objective <https://medium.com/piratechain/monero-xmr-vs-pirate-arrr-d3398dbd9500>
But it could be a marketing piece

[20-Mar-19 04:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes eventually.  The onboarding and documentation and sample projects will allow us to provide a self service system.  Currently there is a lot of synchronous communication required.  I'm working on that part with sidd gcharang alright support input and testers inputs.

IBM opened a gunport first. 
IBM Blockchain World Wire is a cross-country payment system. 
the reason why large companies can take the initiative in what international organizations will do is because of blockchain. 
just as the Internet has approached the public under the name of the World Wide Web (WWW), IBM's WorldWire (WW) may be the first blockchain used by global citizens.

on top of the innovation driven by the Internet and smartphones, a payment war is underway for global IT companies. IT companies such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Alibaba, Facebook and Twitter all have entered the war with their respective weapons or are choosing to breathe in to jump in. the war began with the replacement of credit cards, initially called plastic money. but the Internet has no borders, so the goal of a payment war will inevitably result in creating an Internet currency that can transcend borders. the standard position is glorious, but the war is fierce because it is cramped.

numerous assets on the blockchain trustless platform will gain monetary status, but roughly 2 percent short of global identification. money is global, but if you can't identify who it is, the existing financial network, credit cards, which also confirm who it is, may be better.

And "Approximately 75% of blocks in the Komodo blockchain are mined by Notary Nodes" I forget if this is by design or if this has just been the case. If it's the latter the sentence should probably read "Approximately 75% of blocks in the Komodo blockchain have been mined by Notary Nodes"

In order to approach complex phenomena, the question may have to be rather simple.

When i first dug into Bitcoin, there was something that was simply unacceptable in mainstream economic thinking. 

So i asked myself a simple question and wanted to make a decision. 

Can the government stop it? 
It seemed self-evident that the government would try to stop it if it could. 

But what if you can't stop it? 

Of course, not all of them, but I thought there must be a government on the planet led by the elite who thought they should lead if they can't stop it.

CC icons, didn't think of that. I could see that being a good idea for a lot of the front facing stuff

even better in the style of fontawesome. Good for documentation, downloadable as SVG or PNG, can use that for the SDK's but others too.

I started taking KMD vs eth when I asked what platform they were on.

Kmd is gonna be THE platform for the weed crypto universe apparently. Yet again, great work @FishyGuts. Considering heading to Denver myself for the shindig.

Hehe @actionslacks that was 1,000% unintentional.  
A friend of a friend is on their team and we recognized each other.  We started talking and he asked about Komodo. 
20 years in sales environments just came spewing out naturally and all of a sudden they‚Äôre talking moving platforms.  #sellthebenefitnottheblockchain #closed üòÇ

What are the chances we can partner with "spend"? they have a mobile wallet and send you a Visa Spend card that you can use directly from your wallet.
