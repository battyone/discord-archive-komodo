Any progress updates on rebranding?

[06-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Audo#5667
I am not sure what I can say and what not. We just had a meeting though. Things are progressing.

We do plan to keep the community updated, so sooner or later there will be a blog post that covers the current situation.

We have also worked out a quick content update to the website that includes new messaging. That's not really part of the rebrand, but a step to the right direction.

[06-Nov-18 08:47 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Hate to be this guy, but would love some actual timeframe rather than the ‚Äúwait and see eventually‚Äù answers.  That‚Äôs been going on for nearly two years now.  I know the transition is new but for excitement, interest, and overall brand trust it‚Äôs good to have deadlines we can look forward to.

Komodo And Ideas By Nature Team Up To Drive Komodo 2.0 Rebranding
Komodo Platform was teamed up with Ideas By Nature, a Denver-based blockchain agency, to complete a full rebranding and create a focused product strategy.

The Rebrand got kicked off at the end of August. We are currently in phase 4 per the blog post above.

[06-Nov-18 09:04 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Once rebrand and visual identity have been decided, IBN will be making joint, regular updates on progress.

[06-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We can't showcase anything until those approvals and decisions have been made.

[06-Nov-18 09:06 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We're currently building out the new webpage wireframe,  making final logo decisions, completed agama UX/UI research and initial feature list requirements.

Crazy idea I had in mind : i imagined a promo video once scaling is done : a guy at home receiving his salary. Zooming on the amount and currency showing KMD. Then showing that guy paying for stuff with credit card : choose currency : KMD. Payment done. Then global zooming out : seeing the whole country : the user is now a pixel. But progressively others pixels shows up representing the whole population and a text showing : state transaction/s average : X.
Capacity of KMD tech chains : 1 million. 
Fade out with KMD animation showing up.

everyone Hey guys i seen a comment about ether marketing a while ago just to  let you know among their techniques  they used fb ads which isnt posssible right now, BUT i know a way we could leverage fb and other social platforms to some extent i.e. make a blockchain building course for free, on komodo of course and teach how to use it so more people will use it and will be more understandable for people without IT background. I can deliver it in Polish if materials in english will bw provided ;)

It‚Äôs a text outline.  For developers.  But managing assets can easily be included.  It‚Äôs only in planning stages.  The focus/polish on dev docs is also being worked on and must be completed more.  It is about 50% through first draft.  Maybe 2-3 more weeks til first draft.

[08-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Audo#5667
Hey guys, I'm looking for ideas. Let's think big for a moment... how do we *really* make Komodo succeed? In my mind we just must focus on building a large ecosystem. Here's what I am thinking: 

Our vision is to build an ecosystem.

To do that we need to empower developers and start-ups to build products using our technology. Thus we must understand what they need and then have all the solutions ready for them.

Here‚Äôs a list of what a developer or start-up might be looking for:

- get a high-level overview of what Komodo is about
- understand what he can build with the technology
- browse actual projects which use our technology
- access Komodo‚Äôs developer documentation & code examples
- learn more about blockchain & coding in general (courses)
- participate in networking opportunities: a forum to talk with other developers
- get capital for development
- have a platform to let the community know about the project he started
- provide updates about his progress
- share his experiences & frustrations through a blog & articles

Question  1: What is a developer or project looking for? What do they need?
Question 2: How do we build a scalable platform (not in a technical sense) that empowers the developer?

[08-Nov-18 04:44 PM] Audo#5667
what are all the components we need for this dragon to wake up? We have been discussing about launching a community news/blogging platform, and we have also been thinking how to use/leverage our forum more... how do we empower and activate the community members.

[08-Nov-18 04:51 PM] joe2x4#5987
Buttons. Lots of buttons

[08-Nov-18 04:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I would add for intro to developers an honest comparison table of the advantages/differences of building on Komodo rather than Ethereum or other platforms

[08-Nov-18 04:55 PM] joe2x4#5987
Tip bot, KMDice, pirate. These are fun things. Community has been in wait mode 4ever. Give us stuff to play with and the community will grow. So, in a nutshell, buttons, lots of buttons to push

[08-Nov-18 05:31 PM] yorklab#7270
GUI, GUI, GUI.  Komodo is so diverse and goes through so many changes that creating a single GUI  for the entire exco system  will take some time. I think @grewalsatinder  library and education approach to attract new devs is a great idea, but that also will take time. In the meantime perhaps the team can come up with something that is very narrow in scope; start off with something basic. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's a GUI that performs a task that the rest of the crypto world says "Well, the best way to do that is with Komodo's (whatever the app is).  For instance: in parallel with the MM 2.O development someone also develop's a very basic BarterDEX GUI that can only trade BTC-KMD and KMD-BTC and nothing more to start with. If it's really easy to use it could create a lot of demand and of course more attention to Komodo. After writing this I realize this may not answer your specific questions, but it's something I've been thinking about.....A simple GUI that performs a simple task that people will use.

[08-Nov-18 07:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
This project seems to do a pretty good job at attracting and even creating developers. The biggest hurdle is educating the prospective user. Most are easily lost, overwhelmed by the scope, or don't have the technical understanding to see the advantages. Pirate is easy because it just does one thing really well... privacy. The magic word for komodo is a little more elusive.

@Audo I mentioned before, teach how to use kmd platform, make a course with basics and let people start their journey with building, make it in few languages so more people with language barrier have access to materials

[12-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Regnar#6164
I would definitely like to get more dApps on board and then have some links to where to find them like what @Audo said with maybe some analytics too. I think we need to get more first of course. There's also stuff like this:
<https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com/>
which would be really helpful as well for people to build dApps using CC. 

Also the 3rd party ecosystem section here is loaded with projects that are building on KMD or working with us on things. There should eventually be a place for them as well so investors/developers can explore what's being built.

[12-Nov-18 02:13 AM] Regnar#6164
also @Audo I like this idea by Clovyr which has a smooth button focused way of building basic chains.
<https://clovyr.io/>
Which I imagine would have simple things like uploading an image, choose a name, and sliding bar for parameters of coin amount and premine. buttons to choose distribution method (dICO, ICO, AirDrop, mining) if you want mining halvings, and how long you want the chain to grow for (say 20 years, and it will auto calculate the block size needed). Tx fees, if you want a founders fee on transactions, privacy functions (zk snarks, starks, ring CT), choose mining algorithm (equihash, verushash, Proof of stake, others, or hybrid with a percent slider. A single click for dPoW protection, auto push updates (KMD updates are auto pushed to your chain), and selecting where you want to start your nodes/mining (have click options for various servers like AWS, other 3rd parties, or local machine), if you want Agama and BarterDEX integration, and whatever else will be modular. 

Then at the end it spits out a summary document showing all the relevant chain related highlights so other people can truly see what your chain is, as well as a hash of the chain document information and date of time, that we notarize to the KMD main chain channel to prove a chain exists in our ecosystem (just for the coolness and legitimacy sake, so someone can see a chain information and KNOW that there was a premine or w.e.)

And of course any of the additional services that actually cost money will need to be paid.

[12-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Regnar#6164
oh, an autoscale button! you add the option for autoscale, and anytime your chain starts to hit peak load it spawns up the scaling chain either locally, on AWS, or whatever else.

Hi folks, Looking at the new website, trying to get a feel for the intent before I post specific comments. Who is the primary target audience? It feels to be geared towards businesses (using words like customers, product etc), definitely a change from the previous 'to the masses' approach. 
Not voicing an opinion whether that is good or bad, trying to understand the intent üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 10:21 AM] jansako#3330
Here is one suggestion. If the team thinks it is valuable and would like more feedback, feel free to DM:
https://imgur.com/a/qvnym4Y

I think this (perfectly valid!) question should be asked in a one-on-one biz dev meeting, not on the website. The prospects come to the website seeking options/answers, not more questions. The idea is good, but the page should contain options as answers to the 'what you need' question (which it does).  The question itself should not be highlighted, is what I am saying.

Formulate the question the visitor is most likely to ask, then present the answer(s), not the question itself.

[12-Nov-18 01:50 PM] Lennart#9331
just one thought: I'm missing a bit the word "decentraliziation", since that is the driving factor for blockchains. I don't want people think of KMD to be similar to EOS, when they read high TPS, notary nodes (when they don't understand), they might think that this is at least "semi-centralized"

[12-Nov-18 01:51 PM] Lennart#9331

[12-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Regnar#6164
@Audo I noticed that on the interim page we seem to have dropped off Privacy and Simplicity from the 5 pillars and replaced it with Adaptability. Was this intentional?

[12-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Audo#5667
@Lennart yes that's important for sure. We need to tell our story how we differ from the general purpose blockchain platforms (which a single chain / shared infrastructure) and the block producer platforms  such as EOS. Doing that so that everyone understand what we talk about is a challange for sure, but one of the goals of the rebrand.

[12-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Audo#5667
@Regnar yes, we used to have 5 technology pillars, but we changed them to be 4 technology pillars + 4 business pillars. Thus the privacy was dropt from the technology pillars.

Privacy is important pillar, so I would personally still consider adding it and having 5 technology pillars and 5 business pillars. What do you guys think?

[12-Nov-18 01:59 PM] Audo#5667
Simplicity was moved to the business pillars, which are:
 - Autonomy
 - Flexibility
 - Simplicity
 - Reliability

[12-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Audo#5667
We always felt the first three technology pillars were very strong: security, scalability, interoperability.

I like the new 'adaptability' pillar a lot as it covers Komodo's key strength, which is that each blockchain can be fully customized, even their consensus rules can be changed to develop powerful "smart contracts". In other words, we can say that with Komodo you can *launch special purpose blockchains versus getting fixed features on a general purpose blockchain platform*.

You can break down the search into those that are still in concept phase and reach out to the teams making them to see if building on Komodo would be better suited for their needs. Also what types of resources, libraries, guides they need to make their projects work, or expect from a development platform

I really love how Komodo doesn't slander other projects, talk about politics, meme constantly, nor reply in defense to other commenters. Please keep up the good work.

Website looks awesome. It would be cool if a professional but basic video overview of Komodo was on the website

Kind of like the video on https://qtum.org/en site or even https://eos.io . Videos are usually one of the first things people click on for a basic overview

And some reviews on AWS website from those who have built on Komodo or activated DPoW would be cool too https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/CreateReview?pid=0010L00001sCXagQAG&language=en

Thanks for the feedback @Killua . A video will be prepared for the full rebrand launch. We will be working on reviews and case studies to build out the partner page. Currently the focus is on testing and validating solutions alongside AWS so we can offer them as AMIs on the marketplace.

I really like that Global node layout for QTUM. I'd like to see that for KMD as well as the NNs

I don't think the website needs much more or anything. When was the last time you went to Microsoft.com and gave an f what it looks like. If KMD is good, it's good enough to move up in this space. Right now it's a popularity contest. The projects can shift ranks at a drop of a hat. Komodo's tech is a great building, increasing blockchain and btc's foundation. The work can be seen as creative, robust, innovative and flat out cool as hell. Other projects focus a huge amount of time on partnerships, business, legalities, economics, and image. Resources get overdone, and freedom to create is hindered. Tensions build in a tight-fitted federation leaving the dev's tired and pressured. Komodo's move towards rebranding is a refreshment of personality. It gives more presence. It will attract those who have given into the hype and not artistry. There are two visions: one many use to make something likable, and the other few use to like something they make. Ok that was too long lol.

Can anyone believe that this project started just only few hours ago as per time of this tweet? It has chain, explorers, mining pools, social media presence, bitcointalk announcement. Even the basis of this tech, the Assets Crypto-Conditions Smart Contract is there! https:...
