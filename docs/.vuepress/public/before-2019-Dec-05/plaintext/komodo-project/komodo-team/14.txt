[30-Jun-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
So, am I alone in thinking that people should be told that a wallet with advanced coin features exists for Komodo?

[30-Jun-18 01:38 PM] PTYX#6840
Not alone

[30-Jun-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840
Doesn't it have spv now too?

[30-Jun-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I remember ocean mentioning spv

[30-Jun-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, no it's a node wallet

[30-Jun-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840
Oh OK. Still though

[30-Jun-18 01:39 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a wallet that I don't see on the website

[30-Jun-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, afaik, there are only 2 equihash coins that even have a QT

[30-Jun-18 01:40 PM] PTYX#6840
We were definitely the first to have QT

[30-Jun-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
some debate as to "1st"

[30-Jun-18 01:40 PM] PTYX#6840
For equihash

[30-Jun-18 01:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Hmmm

[30-Jun-18 01:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Who is the contender?

[30-Jun-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I thought ocean was 1st, but the other coin (I forget which) markets as 1st

[30-Jun-18 01:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Oh interesting

[30-Jun-18 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
@Audo no wallet app is completely free of bug. Agama has been running smoothly for some time now and no major issues reported. @pbca26 is constantly working improving Agama features. Anyone is welcome to test the versions that are up and submit suggestions to @pbca26  #deleted-channel it will be fixed or improved in the next version.

[30-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Audo#5667
ok, then it sounds like we can give it more attention.

Last time we wanted to market it and build a product page we didn't get a green light (maybe 1-2 months ago).

Now we are in contact with that agency though, so not sure what is the strategy

[30-Jun-18 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
i use only Agama wallet in my computer. SPV is the best and made this multicoin wallet great

[30-Jun-18 01:51 PM] SHossain#0007
KomodoOcean QT wallet also runs very fast on Windows. faster than Agama

[30-Jun-18 02:06 PM] Regnar#6164
I think pushing agama is important, but we seriously need to get the visual appearances of the apps to look somewhat similar. Right now BarterDEX and agama looks like you had downloaded from two completely different places. They should have similar colors and feel, custom icon buttons, etc. I'm still not a fan of the white layout in agama, it doesn't feel like a cool, secure, multicoin wallet. Even simple things like nightmode always appeal to users.

[30-Jun-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, 'BarterDEX GUI' was meant to be a reference implementation of all features that can be done with the DEX API, so I'm not sure that it could/should be changed to "match"

[30-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure why that affects basic color scheme matching?

[30-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Audo#5667
@Regnar exactly!

We have had a little easter egg on the public trello board that I think no one has yet noticed: https://trello.com/c/rQT96e2v/13-hiring-an-agency

We will be working with this agency to create public facing products that all share the same branding: https://www.ideasbynature.com/

They are the same guys that created Shapeshift, so we feel pretty confident that they are able to pull everything off from technical standpoint.

[30-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Regnar#6164
I can totally understand some of the buttons and layouts etc. But themes etc

[30-Jun-18 02:11 PM] jorian#4555
i noticed that agency

[30-Jun-18 02:11 PM] jorian#4555
i just wonder what that means: complete rehaul? Komodo 3.0?

[30-Jun-18 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Sorry if I'm being succinct in my responses, typing on mobile

[30-Jun-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, any theme "matching" should happen in similar apps - i.e., Since Agama is an "every man's apps" then some "SimpleDEX" should "match" it
Otherwise, you're at "My cargo truck doesn't look like my Porsche"

[30-Jun-18 02:13 PM] jorian#4555
i tend to agree with what grewal once said: komodo should present a reference app of the tech that komodo makes. then others can see how it could work and make an own version.

[30-Jun-18 02:13 PM] Audo#5667
We will post more info later, but we are talking with them and they are very excited about Komodo and atomic swaps. We will be building user facing applications with them with a goal of getting a wide user adoption.

[30-Jun-18 02:13 PM] jorian#4555
since anyone can build on Komodo tech

[30-Jun-18 02:13 PM] Audo#5667
yeah, that's what HypderDEX did üëç

[30-Jun-18 02:14 PM] jorian#4555
exactly

[30-Jun-18 02:14 PM] jorian#4555
and with hyperdex, anyone can make a DEX. (How to make your own DEX in 30 minutes)

[30-Jun-18 02:14 PM] PTYX#6840
We are doing it without an agency. I feel the resources are available. At least to me they were

[30-Jun-18 02:14 PM] PTYX#6840
However, if it means results. Then I'm for it.

[30-Jun-18 02:15 PM] jorian#4555
so the roadmap that existed before, is that still in place?

[30-Jun-18 02:17 PM] Audo#5667
Using an agency is certainly costs more, but at the other hand we get very reliable launch dates and world-class UX & UI. Considering that Komodo is currently leading the industry on many aspects we need to move fast. It's not enough to let everyone know that we have the technology, we must bring the proejcts cross the finish line so the average users can use them (think of Shapeshift or Exodus Wallet).

[30-Jun-18 02:18 PM] Audo#5667
The team is reviewing both technical and marketing roadmaps ‚Äì more updates later

[30-Jun-18 02:18 PM] PTYX#6840
Success will be dictated by results. How far along is the agency?

[30-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Audo#5667
We are just getting started from what I know ‚Äì that's all I know

[30-Jun-18 02:19 PM] PTYX#6840
I see

[30-Jun-18 02:20 PM] jorian#4555
in my opinion, you'll have 2 different target groups. hiring the agency will help the end-customer. Granny friendly apps, catered by the komodo platform. Then there's the developer as target, where Komodo Platform caters developers with good documentation and tools, so that anyone can build their own app.

[30-Jun-18 02:22 PM] jorian#4555
and with that, i remember some months ago the discussion about which way the Komodo Platform should develop, and I remember that each tech would get his own 'group' of people working and marketing it. JUMBLR, DEX, Agama, etc.

[30-Jun-18 02:44 PM] dan.#2473
Defining what the goal is as an organization is number one. It seems there's a flux of what is wanted . We should wait, we shouldnt wait, etc

[30-Jun-18 02:45 PM] dan.#2473
After then a path can be laid out to achieve the core goal

{Reactions}
üëçüèø 

[30-Jun-18 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
yes, i tried pointing that out

[30-Jun-18 02:58 PM] jorian#4555
and i hope the agency that's about to be hired, can help with getting direction

[30-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Audo#5667
yep, that number one goal for Komodo is to provide Assetchains (and technology in general).

If 100 projects start building something with their own Komodo Assetchain then they form an ecosystem.

The user facing applications we have are to support that ecosystem vision, e.g. multi-coin wallet and DEX

[30-Jun-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*e.g. multi-coin wallet, single-coin wallet, and DEX

[30-Jun-18 03:03 PM] dan.#2473
I think an agency is a good move

[30-Jun-18 03:04 PM] dan.#2473
Agency's don't stay in business long without measurable results

[30-Jun-18 03:13 PM] dan.#2473
Is this agency getting involved with social media as well ?

[30-Jun-18 03:36 PM] Audo#5667
no, they will do GUI development (including UX & UI), branding

Details are not clear and could change. This is just a headsup about our plan. We will announce more once things are finalized

[30-Jun-18 04:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Honestly, I love the exodus wallet look and feel for a user facing wallet. Not as much functionality vs agama, it's very friendly to new crypto users. I'm sure there is a market for a version of agama like this. Though not necessarily needs to be released by Komodo

[30-Jun-18 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
I tried to poach one of their frontend devs

[30-Jun-18 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
Lol, it didn't work

[30-Jun-18 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
We was "extremely happy" with exodus

[30-Jun-18 05:37 PM] Audo#5667
The current marketing team is:
 - Steve: the marketing lead and strategist
 - Ben: Social Media and community engagement
 - Audo: I help out everywhere I can, like community building!
 - Daniel & Davion: our writers (currently part-time)
 - Bryan: animation/video (part-time)
 - Graphics: we are looking for someone to come full time

When it comes to marketing strategy, Steve would be the best guy to explain. In short, there are few things we need to have a solid foundation for effective marketing:

 - Clear vision about what our Komodo project wants to do and achieve
 - Brand architecture among all the various parts and projects we have
 - Messaging and stories to quickly explain what we do and how our tech works

The goal is to have a clear brand for Komodo. That means, that if I say "Komodo" you will think about one thing... and that one thing is the most important thing.

If I say Shapeshift, you think of an easy exchange service
If I say Ethereum, you think of a smart contract platform for developers
If I say, Stratis, you think of a blockchain provider for the enterprise

If I say Komodo, what do you think?

If we ask this from many people, I would guess we would get very diverse answers ranging from DEX, to dICO platform, to privacy coin... and that is one of the problems we have. We need to develop a clear brand and messaging for Komodo for the marketing to work.

If our community struggles to explains what we do, how can we ever grow?

At the moment it looks like we are planning to brand Komodo as an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" that allows everyone to launch their independent blockchain.

I also want us to talk more about 'ecosystem', and that is where I believe our vision comes in. We provide technology for the whole industry to build an interoperable ecosystem. Komodo itself is not an ecosystem; it is just helping to build an ecosystem.

`That means, that if I say "Komodo" you will think about one thing... and that one thing is the most important thing.`
I'm not sure that "one thing" could ever do justice to all of the things that Komodo is and/or will be

[30-Jun-18 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless that "one thing" is "a pioneer and leader in the crypto space"

[30-Jun-18 05:41 PM] PTYX#6840
I agree with the above. I don't agree with it taking so long.

[30-Jun-18 05:44 PM] Daiyox#2701
What first comes to mind when I think Intel would be CPU's, but they produce much more than CPU's.. When I think Komodo, I believe I should think of one thing as well, so one feature should be primary, the other features while those in the know have a hard time deciding how any could be secondary, they should be and tagged as projects "Powered by Komodo" ..Thats my opinion

[30-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Audo#5667
Yes that one thing has to more or less hold everything we do inside it, and "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" pretty much does, right?

To create a powerful brand it has to be a one thing ‚Äì and it cannot change.

{Reactions}
üëçüèø (2) 

[30-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Audo#5667
yes exactly @Daiyox , that is our current plan for BarterDEX backend. It would carry its own brand and it would be "powered by Komodo"

[30-Jun-18 05:50 PM] Daiyox#2701
I personally like "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" as primary as it is reaching out and feeding the ecosystem, the more projects using Komodo as a provider the more visibility / clout is had behind other Komodo powered projects.  The provider angle is  great marketing in a way, just as people may of initially noticed Intel after buying a PC containing its chips

[30-Jun-18 05:51 PM] Daiyox#2701
I think in short, I just agree /votes the way you all are already thinking üòÉ

[30-Jun-18 05:56 PM] Audo#5667
Yes, and I can't stress the brandin value there enough. We must get hundreds and thousands of projects to use our technology. Our brand has to scream security & innovation, and we must be seen as the authority on the industry.

If we try to mix in other things it would dilute our brand value, e.g. a decentralized exchange, and even a multi-coin wallet in my personal opinion. Many of these things are still under discussion.

Take a real-life case: Lexus is a luxury car with its own branding, but it is made by Toyota.

We want to make BarterDEX its own brand, made by Komodo

[30-Jun-18 05:58 PM] Audo#5667
There's a very good reason why Toyota gave Lexus it's complete brand indepenence. For the same reason we are looking many other aspects in the Komodo sphere and thinking if they should get their own independent brand.

[30-Jun-18 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"There's a very good reason why Toyota gave Lexus it's complete brand indepenence. "
Because no one is going to pay $100,000 for a Corolla

[30-Jun-18 06:02 PM] Audo#5667
in our case that's a bit more tricky, and BarterDEX backend in my opinion could be under the main Komodo brand. Both have their plust and minus sides. One other thing our team was thinking was the importance to make BarterDEX seens as an independent project so that other blockchain projects would be more happy to use the technology. If it's seens as "komodo feature" some projects might ignore it as they see us as their competitors.

[30-Jun-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Imo:
1) it's not always a good idea to rely on the luxury car analogy (after all the difference between many GMC products and Cadillacs is smoke, mirrors, price, and perception)
2) When promoting flagship products, never forget that there are other products under that flag that appeal to other demographics (i.e., multi-coin and single coin wallets)

[30-Jun-18 06:08 PM] Daiyox#2701
Good point, even if the technical team working another project understood BarterDEX as the obvious choice to build upon, the "suits" may overule that decision seeing it as technology of a "competitor"...Lots of stupid out there making decisions that don't make sense, so taking away obstacles that could interfere seems wise.

[30-Jun-18 06:17 PM] Daiyox#2701
@ComputerGenie Awesome analogy with the cars.. Lots of assets (car bodies) with the same engine, transmission, etc (drivetrain) ..Very analgous to Asset Chains built around a Primary chain

[30-Jun-18 07:11 PM] yorklab#7270
"we must bring the proejcts cross the finish line so the average users can use them"

I agree with this. An easy to use UI will bring more users; it will essentially market itself. The average user won't care how it works they just want it to work.

@Audo is there dedicated KMD blog somewhere? In the marketing strategy I still miss clear communication / kind of blog with historical progress notes, strategic changes, new devs, new significan community members, technical, partnerships and so on.. to be able to see progress chronologically ... partially it should serve as a chronics but also education and information... also this builds "legacy" which is useful since many brands use it / people trust when there is clarity of information and kind of constant progress visible... Also media will like it  - source for information how KMD/Supernet develops over time. Such blog should be updated with any useful information, but start with what historically happened.

blog with KMD/Supernet timeline, milestones achieved is like open sourcing information - social or crypto media or bloggers, twitters will use it when they need, which will give organic growth later... or maybe even a bit bigger website which will include blog, more detailed articles, usefull links, specific products may have separate landing pages

Doing a complete media kit is in the plans, which I think is partly what you were talking about.

@Audo I ment history more in terms of a time-line where you could see KMD development (tech+strategy+partnerships) down to the origins (maybe also supported in some kind of a graphical map?) -> this is useful for media/bloggers and allows them to build articles since most required information would be in 1 place + ongoing updates. It will allow organic growth in awareness about the platform, because it will allow many people for easy access of information. Easy access for information collected in chronological order in one place is sth basic for marketin I believe, people need to land somewhere when they hear about KMD. Current site is nice, maybe adding a blog section in a tab + some twitter box on the front would make it more "alive" ... I think marketing guys will know it better.
