I like how Charlie warns people to be careful of coins that are susceptible to the attack, but fails to realize that his own coin is also susceptible.

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] PTYX#6840
@tolken given how prone Bluetooth and wireless connections are to attacks, I would think a skilled hacker could intercept the signed transaction. Not sure what he could do with it other than broadcast it or withhold it but I just thought it would be an attack vector.

The industry is and will be learning hard way that they really need to work on methods to prevent from 51% attacks. If you are a dev in this space, I'd suggest you to assess different possible solutions in market. If you are a user, ask your fav project to do so.

@PTYX  we're working on building the new website with Ideas By Nature and dPoW will get its fair share of attention. We've considered creating separate sites for things like dPoW or Agama but ultimately decided against it because we don't really have the resources to build and maintain 3 different sites.

[11-Jan-19 10:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Plus, the Komodo website's domain authority is pretty strong so it has a much better chance of appearing in search engine results

[11-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
For instance, if you search for "blockchain security service" on Google , Komodo is the #1 result.  If we had a separate site for dPoW, we wouldn't be able to rank that well

[11-Jan-19 10:56 AM] sœÜldat#8733
I also think that dPoW should not be separated on another website
