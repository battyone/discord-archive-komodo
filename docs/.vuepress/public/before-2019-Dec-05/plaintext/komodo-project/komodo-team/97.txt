probably not worth it to install solar panels and mine coins , at current price anyway

Who on this Discord is actually part of the Komodo Platform team?  I have people messaging me here to answer my support questions, but one of them said he doesn't know what a "fungible cluster" is.  When I used the Antara Composer to make a new chain, "fungible cluster" was 1 of the 4 customizable categories, so it seems like something the team would know about.  The only official communication I've had so far is an email from Steve Lee, 12 days ago, saying that someone would contact me to answer my questions by the end of the day

[13-Oct-19 06:23 PM] load#7208
to have a currency on the exchange is a fee?

[13-Oct-19 06:24 PM] Slyris#2880

#kmdlabs runs one if you want to see an example of how it works

[13-Oct-19 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
Basically "one coin, many blockchains"

[13-Oct-19 06:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@runpaint a fungible chain allows cross chain token migration. a non-fungible chain does not.
basically with a fungible chain, you can migrate tokens from one chain in the cluster to another. We have done extensive testing in #kmdlabs with this

[13-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Slyris#2880
@load I think there listing fee's, you need to contact the team for more information.

[13-Oct-19 06:27 PM] Slyris#2880

[13-Oct-19 06:30 PM] runpaint#7773
If 2 coins are fungible, does that mean they have to be swapped 1-for-1 and have equal value?  Or can an exchange rate be set?

[13-Oct-19 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
they are always 1 for 1 as of right now

[13-Oct-19 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
really simple way of thinking about it is that it's 1 coin spread across multiple blockchains

[13-Oct-19 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
each blockchain can have a unique purpose or feature

[13-Oct-19 06:31 PM] runpaint#7773
Ok but I assume both chains would have to whitelist the other, or else I could just make a billion coin premine and make it fungible with KMD

[13-Oct-19 06:32 PM] Alright#0419
It relies on a notary network to keep them fungible with each other. So for example, LABS requires 8 notaries to add a new chain.

[13-Oct-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
but yes, pretty much. You can add new coins to the supply by adding new chains to the cluster. LABS has a bunch of stuff to limit this though, could try to walk you through it if you're interested

[13-Oct-19 06:33 PM] Alright#0419
on LABS at least, it's not as simple as 8 notaries adding a new chain to print a billion new coins

[13-Oct-19 06:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
they need to share the same ac_cc parameter to be in the same cluster. and migrations  are validated via dPoW, so without notaries to confirm the creation / burn, it wont happen.

[13-Oct-19 06:35 PM] runpaint#7773
Does AtomicDEX work on fungible clusters, or is that different

[13-Oct-19 06:35 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure what you mean, but if you mean what I think you mean - no.

[13-Oct-19 06:37 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

@load listing your coin on atomicDEX-API is free - only listing it in the mobile DEX application for smartphones does cost a "integration" fee.

{Reactions}
KMD 💯 🔝 

[13-Oct-19 06:39 PM] ca333#0118
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator all KMD smartchains are supported by atomicDEX

[13-Oct-19 06:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yes, I've added a few with electrums in the coins repo to the TUI without issue.

[13-Oct-19 06:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so a fungible cluster could be listed on atomicdex, but the underlying atomic swap tech is not based on fungible clusters.

@runpaint feel free to add your remaining questions you have to our email-correspondence from yesterday OR to the support channel we started the talk in. 
Official team-members have a `Komodo Team` tag - however, we also have service providers with a `Service Provider` tag who can help you or refer you to the right contact.

@runpaint

[13-Oct-19 06:46 PM] ca333#0118
Thats possible - and not a biggie. So what is still unclear to you?

[13-Oct-19 06:55 PM] runpaint#7773
@ca333 is there a list of cluster numbers that are already in use, which I should avoid because other coins are on those clusters?  If there's no need to avoid overlapping cluster numbers, then it seems that the cluster numbers are unnecessary

[13-Oct-19 06:58 PM] runpaint#7773
Maybe the Antara Composer system would've told me the cluster number was already taken, if I had chosen a cluster that was already taken.

[13-Oct-19 07:12 PM] ca333#0118
We don't enforce "unique" cluster IDs (ac_cc param) since you couldn't launch a second chain to interact with the initial chain. Already "taken" cluster IDs can be found here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/dev/src/assetchains.old - and more infos ref. clusters of chains whose tokens are fungible: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-cc

Thank you for your help.  I'm headed to the only Bitcoin ATM in town right now, it's in a very bad neighborhood.  If I get robbed and die, it was good talking with you guys.   If I don't die, I'm about to buy BTC at $9,900.  Either way it's no fun, but if I survive I'm planning to host a bitcoin ATM soon in a safer place.  Then with COMMOD on AtomicDEX, all KMD coins will be 2 easy steps away for anyone in my city who has cash.  Stay tuned

If I had known you sell Bitcoin cheaper, for cash instantly, which you obviously do, I would've bought it from you.  How do you pay for your money transmitter license, and all your locations all over the country? 

 Next time I have a problem with the Komodo Antara Composer checkout, and a Komodo team member asks me to send him Bitcoin instead, and I can't wait 9 days for Coinbase to clear, I'll call you instead of being a sucker.  Because clearly you have a better solution to my problem.  You wouldn't just run your mouth, of course.

[14-Oct-19 12:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
