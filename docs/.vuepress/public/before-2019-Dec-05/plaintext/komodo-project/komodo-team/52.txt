Jackson Palmer is asking questions about dPoW on twitter

[07-Oct-18 08:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
like has any blockchain using dPoW suffered an attempt at 51% attack that was so avoided?

I think maybe channels CC is closer to satoshi's vision as it doesnt have the disadvantages of LN

Andreas seems to care only about lightning network. Thats what he thinks will solve all the bottlenecks, and thus, is the only thing worth talking about innovation wise.

[09-Oct-18 01:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
I am a fan of his work, and his outlook on things

[09-Oct-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
He lacks the updates on the topics he says is not solved.
If he is not up-to-date on the subject that if anyone has solved it, his opinion on it doesn't mean that it's not solved.
I prefer to see the solution working in practice than just listening to his opinion.

He's a great speaker and influencer for Bitcoin community, and I respect his ways of dealing with cryptocurrency crowd.
But I don't like his way of discarding the fact without being assured if he's up to date on the subject and commenting it's not done/solved yet.

Komodo is committed to providing engineering solutions and this partnership further cements the commitment of the team in achieving technology backed by high levels of sound maths and engineering *****principals*****-> principles ‚Äì already recognised by China‚Äôs ministry of industry and information technology.

ultimately it's not my decision... we've picked the finalists and the community will vote on the final 5

we've also got 3 honourable mentions

there's a recording on reddit in the main sticky post where we give feedback - you may find that insighful

[10-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont really understand the value in that. to me it would be obvious to try to onboard as many developers as possible (push them away from the ethereum is best bias) and to grow the ecosystem
