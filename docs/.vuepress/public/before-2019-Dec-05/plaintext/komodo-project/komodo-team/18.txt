No just a repost onto r/cryptocurrency on reddit :)

Re 51% attacks and Delayed Proof-of-Work, would 'Duplicated Proof-of-Work' make it simpler to understand?

[06-Jul-18 01:12 PM] RAE#3178
Perhaps people don't get what it means by 'delayed' and the efficacy is lost ... unless I'm way off with duplicate as an adjective here.

[06-Jul-18 01:13 PM] PTYX#6840
KOMODO 2FA

[06-Jul-18 01:14 PM] RAE#3178
Nice, everyone gets 2FA

[06-Jul-18 01:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Yup, that's how I've even pushing it for chainzilla clients

[06-Jul-18 01:14 PM] PTYX#6840
That's how I refer to it on the upcoming video too

[06-Jul-18 01:15 PM] RAE#3178
I understand that ... makes easy sense. Lay people like myself entering the space would grasp that concept.
Nicely worded mate.

[06-Jul-18 01:17 PM] RAE#3178
Perhaps a community vote (Twitter poll maybe?) on whether 2FA, duplicate, delayed, or another adjective is needed.

People responding to the KIN logo bounties here - if you guys want to have your say then drop in and tell us if you like any of them https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/5-kmd-graphics-a-logo-for-kin-komodo-influencer-network/122/7.

Personally I like the one Brenny did but without the black.

[06-Jul-18 02:35 PM] benohanlon#1119

[06-Jul-18 02:52 PM] RAE#3178
Komodo '3FA' - 1. Your chain  2. Komodo  3. Bitcoin ... authenticated 3 times securing against 51% attack

[06-Jul-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
I thought of the 3FA specially when we have a second tier of notarizations

[06-Jul-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
however, that's just overkill. I think 2FA gets the point across and it resonates with most people

[06-Jul-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
two factor authentication is a common concept

[06-Jul-18 03:06 PM] RAE#3178
Agreed, is 2FA trademarked by Google or anyone else though?

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
i dont think so

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
they trademarked google auth

[06-Jul-18 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
2fa is just an acronym

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] PTYX#6840
yubikey has a 2fa

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] PTYX#6840
and so does authy

[06-Jul-18 03:17 PM] PTYX#6840
we are the first to offer blockchain 2fa

[06-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Seko#7408
2FA for what? Can you explain? 2FA for the chain or for Agama?

[06-Jul-18 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
2FA security for a blockchain. The 2nd factor is bitcoin security

[06-Jul-18 05:10 PM] jorian#4555

[06-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We'll be pushing out more stuff like this in the coming months. THere are a few ideas why. First, some of this knowledge is necessary to understand Komodo's tech so we want to give ppl the chance to learn about it but we don't want to constantly have to explain it. So we can just link back to posts like these again and again. Second, it will serve some SEO purposes and draw in some organic traffic from Google. Third, we hope to build a large body of educational content about blockchain-related topics so that we can establish Komodo as an authority in the space (we are but ppl may not know that). Maybe in the future we'll be able to pull it altogether for an e-book or something along those lines

Let's keep the momentum going. Now that marketing is working with a Badass agency there should be no excuses for some Grade A marketing.

@Daniel CP Do you have a psd of the "road to 1 mil" graphic? I've done ux/ui design for sony sega nike etc, will touch up that graphic and comment on how to run them cleaner for better impact.

Thanks @PTYX  we kick off with the agency Monday, but the momentum will be continuing.

Just threw that together on a spread sheet from some looking around

[08-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Regnar#6164
I haven't benchmarked it against other coins just yet. I also haven't been able to account for Z address balances. or use a richlist since we don't have one right now.

[08-Jul-18 06:21 PM] Regnar#6164
And I'd like to get a better idea of the true exchange balances but haven't really found any of their wallets

[08-Jul-18 06:23 PM] Regnar#6164
Anyway, this was just my take on trying to figure out how we can approach a liquidity problem for our DEXs. it seems enough of the coins are off exchanges for there to NOT be a liquidity problem (assuming everyone wanted to trade and not just Hodl) but I think it would also be important to create a rich list to figure out how much of KMD is being held by a few hodlers.

[08-Jul-18 06:24 PM] Regnar#6164
These numbers are also not MECE, as Development funds could have been used for Voting? and I haven't accounted for the depletion of Development funds since ICO.

[08-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Regnar#6164
But anyway, it would be helpful to get balances of whales and core dev who have been around a long time and likely accumulated a lot, we don't need to announce balances etc as that is private stuff but I'm predicting that low single digit percentages of coin supply could be held by certain members. Not saying this is bad, but maybe they would be interested in being liquidity providers, we just need a better way to find them without outing anyone's ID or tying them to wallet addresses

[08-Jul-18 07:52 PM] GoldmanSocks#8569

To be very general, he's trying to get Komodo registered as a legal entity, develop revenue streams, and attract investment

[09-Jul-18 12:17 PM] PTYX#6840
You mean redfox?

[09-Jul-18 12:19 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't see how the redfox thing I got wind about is any benefit for Komodo. Given that other duties are being ignored to get it done and it's being done in back channels. However, I guess the community will have their take on it.

[09-Jul-18 12:25 PM] PTYX#6840
Why does Komodo need to be a legal entity? It's an open source project and not having an entity to go after is one of its strengths

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[09-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Audo#5667
Here's my take

- Open source development should be kept separate from the 'for profit' side or 'legal side'
 - Some legal entities are necessary to make business deals and partnerships, and to generate a revenue model for the long term foture.

What is the best approach to do this is a huge question that our team is researching. Not much more can be said at this point.

[09-Jul-18 01:16 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I agree with Audo. Just because some form of a legal entity exists doesn't mean that it has to be directly associated with or even called "komodo", but having a legal entity is gonna be essential whether we like it or not

[09-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Daniel CP#2020
VC funds and other large investors won't do touch a decentralized, open-source platform

[09-Jul-18 01:19 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And we don't necessarily need funds right this second-- things are humming along just fine -- but there are many competitors out there flush with cash who will catch up with our tech if we aren't careful

[09-Jul-18 01:20 PM] Daniel CP#2020
So raising funds will prob become very important at some point in the future

[09-Jul-18 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840
So a foundation structure is needed first which doesn't engage in business directly and a llc to engage in business.

[09-Jul-18 01:23 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the proper way of doing it. However, how are you going to create a foundation for an already established project that didn't run KYC during the ICO?
