yes, thanks! every bit helps

[06-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Allen#8663
When will we get our funds back? I've already filled the form.

[06-Jun-19 03:57 PM] PTYX#6840
The team will make an announcement in regards to returning funds. Be patient üôÇ

[06-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Allen#8663
How many funds are in control of hacker right now since hacker was able to take some funds out.

[06-Jun-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure untill all claims are filled out

[06-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Allen#8663
It's funny that in the security announcement, they don't acknowledge that hacker was able to get hold of 'some' funds.

[06-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Allen#8663
I've tipped some cryptocurrency websites about this. Let's see who picks this up first.

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Allen#8663
People need to know the truth.

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you follow the discord a bit they have already acknowledged multiple times that approx 1million kmd was stolen and jl already pledged a significant amount of his personal funds

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There are no secrets

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But feel free to spread meaningless fud ...

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Allen#8663
It should be mentioned in the security announcement, right?

[06-Jun-19 04:14 PM] klein#5233
it has been

[06-Jun-19 04:14 PM] klein#5233
how exactly did you find out about it

[06-Jun-19 04:16 PM] hastrup#8742
@klein lol XD

[06-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
come here just to troll?

[06-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Allen#8663
@klein where exactly in announcement does it mentions about 1 million stolen KMD?

[06-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Expect some misinformation trolls to pop up. Still waiting on the troll to claim it was all a marketing ploy by James to scam exit.

that was posted in every main channel

[06-Jun-19 04:24 PM] Allen#8663
@klein but not in security announcement that is being passed around everywhere?

[06-Jun-19 04:26 PM] klein#5233
it is what it is

[06-Jun-19 04:26 PM] klein#5233
no one is hiding there is a loss

[06-Jun-19 04:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Allen what are you here for exactly?

[06-Jun-19 04:27 PM] Allen#8663
Well, I came here for my lost komodo funds and discovered that team is hiding some facts from public. that's all.

[06-Jun-19 04:28 PM] klein#5233
facts are facts, no harm in reporting the facts

[06-Jun-19 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
Total losses are still changing, numbers don't want to be given out that are incorrect

[06-Jun-19 04:28 PM] klein#5233
technically speaking how much will be lost to komodo users may well be less than 500k

[06-Jun-19 04:28 PM] Allen#8663
@dukeleto but don't you think team should atleast mention that ~1M KMD are in possesion of hacker?

[06-Jun-19 04:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
and remember, developers don't write press releases nor control journalists

[06-Jun-19 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not involved in talking to journalists, but I am a developer

[06-Jun-19 04:29 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The people writing the articles are free to add how many funds were lost. It's no secret how many were taken. Next you'll be pissed that James didn't mention the color shirt he was wearing when it happened.

üßêIMPORTANTüßê @KomodoPlatform has become aware of a compromised nodeJS dependency in the Agama Wallet. If you have funds in Agama, $KMD, $HUSH or any coin, move it now or risk losing funds!

it's all plain and public and clear as I could make it

[06-Jun-19 04:29 PM] Allen#8663
this should have been mentioned here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] UruDude#8484
HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHA

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not in KMD marketing or PR

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] UruDude#8484
500 lines of code

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] UruDude#8484
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Allen#8663
Good for you.

[06-Jun-19 04:30 PM] UruDude#8484
tbh I thought you were one of the few serious projects out there

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Allen#8663
Anyway, I have been a huge KMD fan. I was infact one of the first to comment on your bitcointalk thread couple of years back.

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Allen#8663
And I'm still a fan.

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Allen i tend to agree with you, some estimate of the stolen amount would be resonable, tho it's changing by the minute

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Allen#8663
I was even gifted 100 KMD for making a youtube video on how to mine KMD.

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
but alas, i find the code easier than talking to journalists üòÉ

[06-Jun-19 04:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@Allen that support article was written long before we even secured half of the funds, how should we know how much the hacker will get?

[06-Jun-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
any number we put, may be instantly wrong in 10 minutes

[06-Jun-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
but the number that was swept and protected, that is fixed and known

[06-Jun-19 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
I agree that more transparency is good, and yes we have some trolls in here

[06-Jun-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326

@Deleted User ban me after I get my funds. ha ha.

[06-Jun-19 04:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
trolls must feed off energy and KMD has lots of energy right now. Like moths to a candle

[06-Jun-19 04:33 PM] UruDude#8484
I'm just here cuz one of your devs said he solved the oracle problem with 500lines of codes on a weekend

[06-Jun-19 04:33 PM] UruDude#8484
and then this happens

[06-Jun-19 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@UruDude you know stuff üòÖ

[06-Jun-19 04:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[06-Jun-19 04:34 PM] UruDude#8484

[06-Jun-19 04:35 PM] klein#5233

[06-Jun-19 04:35 PM] UruDude#8484

[06-Jun-19 04:35 PM] klein#5233

[06-Jun-19 04:35 PM] UruDude#8484
