I believe one of marketing goals should be to persuade some Eth tokens to move to KMD. Best if those bigger players. If few of them decides, this could move KMD recognition a lot.

The seed words are hidden in various Komodo/Asset chains/friendly forks in apps, articles, pages, papers, etc and the clues for each seed word will direct people to different projects to search for the right word. Some words are only found by searching through an app or apps or maybe a reddit post by Komodo, or even some past twitter posts etc. It's a scavenger hunt, meant to get people to explore Komodo tech and not just like/retweet with the hopes of winning some money.

just an idea for something fun - lottery, with smart contract if somebody up to it. We can make a simple lottery which will draw random address to distribute to once a week or a month. To participate , deposit 1 kmd ( or less or more)  for 1 chance to get pick. what do you think?

[07-Sep-18 03:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Depending on the level of programming intricacy, to give incentive to developers,  maybe we can raise money where holders of lottery tokens will get percentage of the tickets sold.

Only 27 cryptocurrencies had over 400 active addresses today. Yes. 400 users.

Hey marketing channel, especially @Steve Lee @benohanlon  and @Bitcoin Benny I'm sure you remember Min-Liang Tan from Razer posting about looking for a blockchain platform to build upon that was especially good at high TPS and volume, if not, here's the tweet:
https://twitter.com/minliangtan/status/1021564383258759169

anyway, he posted an update about Razer E-Payment proposal for Singapore:
https://www.razer.com/sg-en/epayments-proposal

In particular pay note to "Accordingly, as we do not see any third-party consumer e-payment provider that is gaining traction, we plan to launch Razer Pay in Singapore by Q1 2019. "
https://www.facebook.com/notes/min-liang-tan/e-payments-proposal-singapore-an-update/2023698290983945/

Which indicates that they are in-fact likely to move forward with launching Razer Pay and I can't think of a truly better platform to launch on than Komodo. I'm hoping we can reach out in an official capacity and attempt to woo them to look at Komodo or build upon it. 

Not sure how many of our devs use Razer products but it would be a nice side note in addition to the obvious benefits our platform has. Figured this would be a good lead to reach out to, Min-Liang mentioned getting a lot of shoutouts about building on XRP but XRP is not nearly scalable to nationstate payment processing, nor should a nation share infrastructure and therefore be subjected to limitations simply because someone else on the channel is bigger than they are.

@sœÜldat they source active addresses from coinmetrics.io

[07-Sep-18 06:11 AM] Regnar#6164
"Active addresses data is sourced from Coinmetrics.io, which states: "Active addresses is the number of unique sending and receiving addresses participating in transactions on the given day." 

who I already reached out to a few weeks ago and was told:

"Since resources are limited, we are focusing on supporting larger projects first and working our way down the list. Komodo is on our 'nice to have' list - you're not the first that has asked for it so we're are definitely taking those requests into account."

I'd love to get their data on Komodo, they put out all their data in CSV which is great for messing around in R. If I could post pictures in here I'd show you some of the charts I've made recently haha

[07-Sep-18 06:14 AM] Regnar#6164
Though getting scaling test data may be tricky, I asked in the scaling channel what could be done, but the reality is the scaling data in CSV is likely going to just look like a regular single blockchain, that we just multiple a bunch of times. So charted wise won't be very cool... also the tx fees on KMD don't change as much as some other chains. but this is besides the point

[07-Sep-18 06:14 AM] Regnar#6164
getting 24hr active addresses would be great, ESPECIALLY after block 1MM
