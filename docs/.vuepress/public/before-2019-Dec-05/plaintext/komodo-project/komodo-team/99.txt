I also said 'spamming the same message on multiple channels'

Yes, thank you for the feedback. The instructions are to first warn and then mute if a warning is ignored. There are edge cases and in this case this guy was clearly frustrated and started spamming channels. I agree with @farl that a short mute & warning was good, like he did. I don't see any issue here.

If we need to continue this discussion let's do it on #discord-feedback

thanks!
i just read the atomicdex stress test result announcement.   i used to load test national inbound call centres for carriers with custom software and reading @ca333 's message is great to read.  the dev of the atomic dex network, to maximize the swap-ability up until this point, that enabled ppl to work with the beta product, to see it in action has been very useful - ppl can see the magic working.

to now turn the screws on optimizations at network level is next-level professionalism.

Here is the info on hte underlying p2p network as written by the devs!

I know it isn't a thing Komodo does often but I've been thinking about how to get a better grasp on a general "road map" of sorts within the ecosystem. For example, looking at CC-Assets(tokens) I see some cool proof of concepts being made (I worked on some admittedly less cool ones here). Or the current development on the gaming SDKs, etc. Any Idea on how to display progress on these different things to give someone a single directory to learn about all the different work being done?

[02-Nov-19 11:37 PM] Regnar#6164
and by progress I don't mean commits, but more general terms that would be more "road map" like

[02-Nov-19 11:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Maybe an interactive visual that starts at the top and branches off in a downwards manner?

Ie Komodo up top

Scaling | cc | privacy | dex
Then branch off into what is being worked on for the categories, % to completion/estimated timeframe for beta/public release

[02-Nov-19 11:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be nice to have a roadmap but there‚Äôs way too many things to display neatly in a single line imo

[03-Nov-19 12:02 AM] Regnar#6164
yea definitely too many things for a roadmap, and individual developers are pretty scattered about doing different things.

[03-Nov-19 12:03 AM] Regnar#6164
But I'm trying to think of a good way to showcase some of the proof of concepts we see popping up on random discord channels. This came about because of the Pokemon PoC in #cc-assets

[03-Nov-19 12:04 AM] Regnar#6164
I think something like this would be helpful for developers or even just curious people to see the things that are being made or could be made, specifically with CCs

[03-Nov-19 12:10 AM] Regnar#6164
I think something like this could be cool

[03-Nov-19 12:10 AM] Regnar#6164
https://jaredforsyth.com/treed/

[03-Nov-19 12:11 AM] Regnar#6164
with each branch possibly being a CC and the sub branches being github links to different things being built with them

[03-Nov-19 12:13 AM] Regnar#6164
Or maybe CC is a branch with the different CCs under it and so on, but the higher branches are more wider

[03-Nov-19 12:14 AM] Regnar#6164

[03-Nov-19 01:37 AM] Regnar#6164

[03-Nov-19 02:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Regnar,
An example for devs and people to see what can be done is exactly what is needed.  I'm very grateful that PHBA made his pokemon app in #cc-assets.  It is a great answer to questions I've been getting that can then be followed up with docs and q&a.

A template of things that could be worked on for all of the CCs is what I'm hoping for.

[03-Nov-19 02:17 AM] CrisF#3405
(AtomicDEX is actually the best example of an app being made to show what can be done.)

[03-Nov-19 02:17 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm actually making some edits to the docs I posted above, adding in CC section to place PoCs

[03-Nov-19 02:18 AM] CrisF#3405

With a basic template of what is needed a TRELLO or something similar could be made and people could work on the cc/area that they're interested in and tick things off the to do list.

[03-Nov-19 02:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Crabby Paddy, are you able to make an example of what you mentioned above?  draw.io is pretty awesome üôÇ

Wouldn't need to be anything fancy.  Even a TUI would be good.

Also would provide a chance to bring in anyone who wanted to try out building on a CC.

[03-Nov-19 02:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Once projects start building on the CCs those apps could be referenced.

[03-Nov-19 02:37 AM] Regnar#6164
Submitted a change to the docs, basically moved around the order of things to start with available languages and RPC wrappers, followed by MM2 and CC PoCs, general PoCs, and so on

[03-Nov-19 02:39 AM] Regnar#6164
If it gets merged I'll have to post the link in the CC channels and have people update the PoCs for those CCs, I scrolled through a few and grabbed some links but I'm sure there are more

The road map looks like what I was thinking for a Trello.  Things to be done leading to a simple usecase that could serve as a demo of the tech.

[03-Nov-19 04:56 PM] CrisF#3405
The roadmap would lead to the completion of the demo app and could serve as a basic template for projects to use to make use of the CC if they wanted.
If nothing more it could help us get demo apps for CC's up and running.

[03-Nov-19 05:01 PM] CrisF#3405
PHBA2061 has basically made an app (in #cc-assets that demos 1 feature of the tokens CC.  With a bit more the tokens CC's would be basically done and then making a marketplace app could complete the assets CC.

@Bl0ckchain @zhusu What does "A DEX must be non-custodial." even mean abstractly speaking? Can (anything on top of) ETH ever be non custodial, given ETH's history to hard fork to take custody of funds from a hacker?

[06-Nov-19 01:25 PM] Daniel CP#2020
a DEX being non-custodial is a separate issue from a blockchain's immutability
