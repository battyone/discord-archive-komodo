[25-Jun-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what kind of number should we aim for for the next test? as we are debugging we need to test more chains, I was thinking of x4 the clusters so we use 256 chains.

[25-Jun-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[25-Jun-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this will give us a good result to work with and not cost too much. I dont have exact numbers but these 64 chain tests that run for about 3h-4h cost us about $20 in AWS credit

[25-Jun-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
we can make sure it scales linearly. $5/hr is a very good cost!

EC2 instance is $3 per hour, and DynamoDB is $2 a month... its incredibly cheap.

[25-Jun-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is live data, its hard to apply a smooth to it so that its doesnt spike really high then drop really low due to random block times.

I like that Komodo logo actually.

[25-Jun-18 03:15 PM] Regnar#6164
plus they aren't the only wallet provider that does that, holds proxy tokens to allow people to trade values, but not withdraw or deposit coins. Pretty sure Abra is like this as well. But it has a particular market that they are catering too, and it's not up to us to decide its good or bad, if it works and people like it, then cool.

[25-Jun-18 03:16 PM] Regnar#6164

[26-Jun-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just to be clear here, the test he is using data from, was 50,000 payments not 40,000 TX.

That test with 10,000TX/s litterally cost $20

[26-Jun-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats why I scaled it up to 1 million TX

[26-Jun-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its pretty easy to see on the live site, when it ramps from TX/s to payments the numbers go up 10x.

so if the scaling test is done on public aws servers does it mean its a "live" test as opposed to a "testnet"

I'm confused as to why community members and assetchains are doing more marketing and publishing more content than the Komodo marketing team. You are the marketing manager - we look to you for answers.

[27-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Steve Lee#1967
JL didn't want to directly market the dpow solution directly. so we have been retweeting and sharing what GC posts.

[27-Jun-18 10:28 PM] PTYX#6840
The delayed proof of work is only one thing. After reading multiple comments in the cryptocurrency channel when one of our ambassadors published that we were added to Bitpanda I realized it is a general consensus that Komodo is lacking presence and marketing. I'm speaking in general, I see more marketing from third party members, assetchains, and ambassadors than our own accounts. People are missing informational videos, weekly video updates like PIVX, and other things that promote community.
