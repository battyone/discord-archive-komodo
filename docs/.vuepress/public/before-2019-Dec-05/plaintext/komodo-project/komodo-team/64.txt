I think instead of current $ETH implementation the next version of #ETH would be better comparison to @KomodoPlatform. Current $ETH doesn't stand enough good chance to be compared with $KMD. I need to learn and understand ETH 2.0, #Substrate and @polkadotnetwork

Yea that can be difficult, especially on the internet.

[29-Dec-18 04:45 PM] Seko#7408
To the topic Resistance...
And they advertise being a fork from BarterDEX.  In the Telegram Channel there is criticism of Komodo's marketing.   That your work will be completed by others.
We receive criticism from users again and again. ‚ÄûThe marketing is weak and it comes too little.‚Äú  The dissatisfaction increases.  Especially after the Dex copy.

[29-Dec-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems the fact it is being adopted is a marketing success? in open source, projects that are forked improve, sometimes exponentially. if nobody knew of barterDEX, it wouldnt be forked

[29-Dec-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we are in open source

[29-Dec-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
how could marketing prevent something from being forked. makes no sense

[29-Dec-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
with proper attribution, I have no problems it is forked

[29-Dec-18 05:21 PM] klunex#3191
yea the code seems to be good. I am also convinced about the tech. Thats the reason i am invested. But I cant realy apprechiate that others making gains with the work komodo has done. Is komodo a charity projekt which delivers high tech to others for free?

[29-Dec-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an open source project

[29-Dec-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not a for profit business

[29-Dec-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
usage of the crypto creates the value

[29-Dec-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the projects that create the tech that gets used, will get the value

[29-Dec-18 05:31 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@klunex keep in mind that if they actually improve it, Kmd can then add the same improvements back and it has also a growing ecosystem of blockchains and dapps and technologies. It's not like kmd is dead because someone forks one of the technologies, far from it

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i forked zcash, who forked bitcoin

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to build from the best existing and make it better

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] klunex#3191
i think if nobody knows about the tech it doesnt get used even its the best tech on the planet.

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you are making it better, you are contributing

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] klunex#3191
yea that are coins, speculation objects. Barterdex is real usecase

[29-Dec-18 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so having barterDEX forked, gets it more out there

[29-Dec-18 05:33 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they bring in a lot of marketmakers, which we can all tap into

[29-Dec-18 05:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a zerosum game, which most people are used to thinking

[29-Dec-18 05:35 PM] klunex#3191
i am a bit concerned guys about somebody else is stealing our show. Thats how marketing work. The market is not an idle place, its a fight, unfortunatley.

[29-Dec-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
did LTC steal BTC show?

[29-Dec-18 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is very very rare that a fork ends up with more value than the original

[29-Dec-18 05:36 PM] klunex#3191
btc was clearly first in the collective mind. I am concernet that  barterdex isnt...

[29-Dec-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but they are giving proper attribution to barterDEX. how can it be that people dont understand that barterDEX was there first to be able to be forked?

[29-Dec-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are talking about people who cant understand that something needs to exist before it can be forked...

[29-Dec-18 05:39 PM] klunex#3191
The people out there which is using the dex are mostly not interrestet about history and background. They want just to trade and use a known instrument. Like most of btcusers dont know what is a merkletree.

@klunex  nearly everything kmd does is universally ignored or dismissed. If the tech created here needs to be co-opted to get recognized then at least it is getting acknowledged. I doubt anyone wishing to implement a custom barterdex is gonna be successful without help from this team anyway.

Is it possible to get there liquid providers to bdex?

[30-Dec-18 01:30 AM] chris#0517
No one really knows about barterdex except mostly the kmd ppl in discord. No one will know its origin if someone forks it, makes GUI smooth and releases it. I haven't seen anyone talk about/promote it outside of discord.

[30-Dec-18 01:43 AM] Regnar#6164
BarterDEX doesn't seem to be the focus as a GUI. Just looking at the channels here we have #dev-marketmaker and #dex-hyperdex which is core of BarterDEX and then a 3rd party app that is building on the core. Building the core market maker (v2) has been the focus, not the GUI of barterDEX itself. I think the thought process here is build the engine that works really well and is easy for 3rd parties to build a GUI dApp on top as their own business.

[30-Dec-18 02:15 AM] chris#0517
thx I will learn more about marketmaker

[30-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
marketmaker is based off code james wrote a long time ago. He made an entire BTC daemon in C called iguana. Marketmaker is built on that code base. IT has functions to do just about anything and can talk to just about any BTC clone. but its out dated and slow. As its multi threading was removed for stability. MM2 aims to solve all the issue found when making MM1. Any project hoping to use MM1 to build on, will just run into the same issues as HyperDEX faced. Hopefully they can figuire out how to solve some problems, and we can use that code. This is what open source is about.

[30-Dec-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
to be fair to the much maligned mm1...
it was designed to do atomic swaps and order matching, along the way SPV to be added. so it achieved more than it originally set out to do. from a cli basis, it works pretty well. any sort of multithreaded and queueing ability can be added ON TOP of mm1, which is what is required to create a performant multithreaded system. With a multithreaded overlay and queuing of requests to native mode, it would work, but then people want multithreaded and SPV servers....
that runs into the problem that SPV servers are slow, much slower as compared to native. mm1 served its purpose, it blazed the trail and showed it is possible to make a decentralized orderbook cleared via atomic swaps. the utxo issue is probably more of a hindrance than the single threaded issue for the daemon level. Remember all bitcoind rpc calls are single threaded and mm1 uses the same model

[30-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
last i checked we do have performant multithreaded systems using bitcoind, even though bitcoind is single threaded. this should prove that even though mm1 is single threaded (at the rpc level), it is also possible to have a multithreaded view

[30-Dec-18 09:18 AM] tolken#2655
Hopefully Artem and team are well on their way for mm2. I‚Äôm eager to see it adopted and used regularly.

[30-Dec-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used a multithreaded marketmaker for the streamer, works really well.

[30-Dec-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, proving the multithreaded use of mm1 is possible, it just means you need to implement the multithreading on top of mm1. given enough work it would be possible to make mm1 appear much more seamless, but mm2 will make it easier to achieve

[30-Dec-18 06:46 PM] klunex#3191
@actionslacks the point is that we had from 16th of march on a dex which was able to do swaps over around 95% of all existing coins. We where the only one in the space. Thats a huge advantage from a marketing perspective which we lost now. At the end its not important who invented the tech, at the end counts who brings the tech to the users. Lets say gerneral motors build a new engine, bmw copies it, make publicity and sells it.  Nobody of the car users care who build the engine. They are just happy that they have a car with an amazing engine who drives them from A to B.  In the space general motors has the recognition of the nerds, yes. But it doent harvest the fruits.

[30-Dec-18 07:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No one will dominate the Dex field until the tools that are needed are built for LPs

[30-Dec-18 07:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Resistance does not have those tools either

[30-Dec-18 07:39 PM] klunex#3191
LP?

[30-Dec-18 07:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Liquidity providers

[30-Dec-18 07:51 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex whit that logic there is also one exchange in the world. there will be many Dex some use kmd tec some don't.

[30-Dec-18 07:52 PM] hastrup#8742
Like there is many different exchanges now.

[30-Dec-18 07:58 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup do the supernet asset holders profit if somebody is using kmd tech?

[30-Dec-18 08:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends

[30-Dec-18 08:00 PM] hastrup#8742
If there are using the core tech yes if not. They do not profit directly but you can sey free advertising and if they come up whit some God code we can use it

[30-Dec-18 08:01 PM] hastrup#8742
So sudo free programmer

[30-Dec-18 08:23 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup  What do you think is the future of barterdex? Whats the strategy to attract users?

[30-Dec-18 08:27 PM] hastrup#8742
Bdex it self is not trying to find users. Projects that makes nice gui will find users  project like coin collect, zaddex, Magnum, pungo, √∏ crypto union, Hyperdex bdex is the tech behind its not trying to get users it's trying to get projects

[30-Dec-18 08:28 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex

[30-Dec-18 08:30 PM] klunex#3191
if i use barterdex or the hyperdex gui i am always on the same marketplace or not?

[30-Dec-18 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
same

[30-Dec-18 08:57 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex  that is the beauty of bdex all of the above project will use the same tech under the hood so all of them will get the advantage of the other projects lp. All the project is helping each other to succeed

[30-Dec-18 08:58 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup how can we attract users to our marketplace?

[30-Dec-18 08:59 PM] klunex#3191
do you think they are coming by themselfs?

[30-Dec-18 09:01 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex no that is the marketing from all of the above mentioned projects. bdex role is to provide a easy and stabile setup for the programmers so that they can write gui code that is easy and fast for the user to use.

[30-Dec-18 09:23 PM] klunex#3191
Resistance is using komodotech but its a different marketplace. In my opinion they are ready now. Now they go into phase two. Phase two is to get the stone rolling. For that they make a big marketingcampaing to bring the volume and useramount to a level that other users get attacted (high liquidity etc.) and so on. This is necessary to get an exchange running. 
We have to go trough this process as well if we want that barterdex is usable. We can program the most userfriendly gui in the world and the most advanced tech. Trough this process we have to go. And its not getting easier as we see that we have a competitor. And do not believe that this competitor is advicing komodo to their users. They are focused and determined.

[30-Dec-18 09:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Have you ever used BarterDEX or another atomic swap Dex like blocknet .

[30-Dec-18 09:24 PM] klunex#3191
bdex and hyperdex i used

[30-Dec-18 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Now put yourself in the mindset of someone who trades for a living, what do they need to accomplish their livelihood above board.  And do any Dex setups have this now.   It's not as simple as bringing users and liquidity.

[30-Dec-18 09:30 PM] klunex#3191
I think this guys spend a lot of money for the maketingcampaign. 
1.) they are stupid. They dont realise what you say.
2.) they know what they are doing.

[30-Dec-18 09:30 PM] hastrup#8742
Jl777 said: maybe they bring in a lot of marketmakers, which we can all tap into. So as far as I understand it we can use there lp. They Wil differently not be the only one in the space and when some clever ppl come in the space they want to know how did they do it. Kmd tec that's how. And meybe they fork and give back some great code we can use and some advertising or they want kmd help to get started. Both ways is good for kmd

[30-Dec-18 09:38 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup in the idle case most of the ppl dont care how they do it, they just want to trade, enjoy the advantages of a decentrlized exchange and thats it. If they like, they tell to other ppl and so we have a network effect. Nobody care that the tech comes from komodo. Komodo? what? Isnt that a lizzard?

@klunex if you have funds to donate for a pure advertising campaign (it seems that is what you believe marketing is) then we will happily accept the donation and spend it as you suggest

[30-Dec-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
short of funds raised for advertising, i do not believe it is cost effective use of funds

[30-Dec-18 09:43 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex yes of course ppl do not care where the tech is from. That is not the point. If they succeed then it must be because they have done something right whit the mm. If so kmd can use it now 6 project can use the same code for there project

[30-Dec-18 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810

so you are pretending that we have millions upon millions to spend. we dont

[30-Dec-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course, if we had $100 million to spend on advertising, then we could have done a lot of advertising

[30-Dec-18 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but KMD is more an infrastructure project, not really direct to consumers, so consumer advertising is not really effective

[30-Dec-18 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you feel strong enough to raise funds for a consumer marketing, then go for it
