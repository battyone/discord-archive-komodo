Or, I can point out that your first comment here recently, quoted me directly, twice., despite knowing I blocked you. You could grow up, and stop quoting me.

turns out a pretty professional document (this is on ETH) hopefully Steve can reach out and talk with them

[28-Jun-18 06:20 PM] Regnar#6164
I gave them Steve's email and skype to have a call. They also said they'd send me their draft before publishing so that we can fact check it for any errors etc.

[28-Jun-18 06:23 PM] Regnar#6164
I haven't been able to read all 40+ pages of it yet, but it appears to be extremely professional and well thought out. It would be definitely beneficial to have such an objective report written about Komodo and we could potentially present it to institutional investors as 3rd party objective analysis in addition to our traditional marketing material.

@Steve Lee hey Steve I know you've got new templates/themes you want to use for Komodo updates, announcements etc that have specific feel and color schemes.

I think we should make one specifically for coin announcements getting listed on BarterDEX. I tried doing this a while back but the updates of new coins seemed spaced out and made distribution of any marketing material difficult/last minute. I was thinking we could have a pre made template with komodo logos and listing announcement etc and when coins put their info in on Github to be listed, they can give their logo and the email address of whoever runs their social media, and we simply add their logo to the graphic and email it to their social media person saying, "hey here's our official announcement poster, your coin should be supported on X day, feel free to post this to your Twitter and tag us and we'll retweet!"

The github request makes it so we can reach out into other coin communities and get unique impressions. 

"Adding a coin got much easier.¬†Any new coin add request now ONLY has to go to this repository:¬†https://github.com/jl777/coins."

[28-Jun-18 08:57 PM] Regnar#6164
Thoughts anyone?

[28-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we just discussed this today in a meeting

[28-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Steve Lee#1967
we're setting up a process so we're updated on new integrations and we will collect and announce

[28-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Regnar#6164
Collect and announce?

[28-Jun-18 08:59 PM] Steve Lee#1967
not per coin, like batch updates

[28-Jun-18 08:59 PM] Steve Lee#1967
weekly or monthly. we're figuring out what the best process would be for meaningful  updates

[28-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean us announcing it I feel will only get it out to our own followers. Wouldn't per coin be more effective at outreach? A small cap coin that gets listed is probably going to be less receptive to tweeting to their followers that they are 1 of 20 coins to be added.

[28-Jun-18 09:02 PM] Regnar#6164
It's of course more work, which is why I suggested having a simple Komodo template where we slap the logo they provided us on it, and send their social media email the poster to tweet.

[29-Jun-18 07:58 AM] Audo#5667
Those five points are a good summary towards investors.

We are about to announce 5 technology pillars (security, scalability, interoperability, privacy, simplicity) that we hope would make it easy to understand what we are trying to offer. These pillars are directed more towards businesses / entreprise / developers to which we want to sell our Komodo Assetchain technology.

I would love to market Agama Wallet more, but for that to happen our team needs to finalize PEN testing and then we it would deserve its own landing page. We might actually soon have something cool to announce as Steve has been talking with one Agency who is going to help us build THE BEST multi-coin wallet on the industry. I heard from Steve these guys are really exited about Komodo üòÉ

Good news @Audo , you talk about HyperDEX website ?

[29-Jun-18 08:07 AM] Audo#5667
My elevator pitch for KMD is... 

> Komodo is an end-to-end technology provider with a vision of building an interoperable ecosystem. With Komodo you can host your own infrastructure and connect your project into the whole ecosystem, including a multi-coin wallet and decentralized exchange. The Komodo blockchain offers security and interoperability services for all the other blockchains on our ecosystem.

Something like that... what do you guys think?

If I would be talking to an investor perhaps I would highlight how Komodo is the base currency of the entire ecosystem, and that you get 5 % rewards and good privacy.

[29-Jun-18 08:09 AM] Audo#5667
Yes, HyperDEX team did a soft-launch. For official launch they will have website and everything.

[29-Jun-18 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or something else relevant to our case....

[29-Jun-18 08:16 AM] Audo#5667
Since Komodo offers very wide range of technologies we have concluded to talk about 'end-to-end technology'. I guess 'blockchain' is the standard term everyone uses to refer to the technology. Even wider term would be 'ledger technology'. I haven't came up with any other term that could hold all our tech inside it.

The best option in my mind would be to talk about "Blockchain as a Service", "Infrastructure as a Service" or "Platform as a Service"... but we are little concerned to promise this as currently we have a DIY model. For now we are just providing technology, there is no service to sell. If we would mention service then many businesses would assume we offer a lot more than pure technology.

It's very clear, and I think it's very important to really explain that the big difference of komodo with other blockchain platforms is that on Komodo you can create your own completely independent blockchain. people have trouble understanding this

[29-Jun-18 09:01 AM] Audo#5667
yeah they do. Even when I explain that "with Komodo you get your own blockchain" or "native blockchain" .... most people don't understand what  I mean by that. 

Thus now I prefer to tell them that "with Komodo you can host your own infrastructure and not be dependent on a public blockchain". That makes our benefits more clear, but I'm afraid that then we have the problem of making a distinction with a private permissioned blockchain. At least the moment we only provide public permissionless blockchains.
