As James just said.

[27-May-18 07:42 PM] emmanux#0000
And on CHIPS it's not even for transactions (like, payments), it's for speeding up a game (it is not used outside the game, or it could be user, but it is not intended for that).

[27-May-18 07:42 PM] emmanux#0000
yes

[27-May-18 07:57 PM] emmanux#0000
"Retrasada" is synonym for "retarded" in spanish, lol

[27-May-18 07:57 PM] emmanux#0000
("delayed")

[27-May-18 07:57 PM] emmanux#0000
Readers will think that we're "mentally delayed" 😛

[27-May-18 07:58 PM] emmanux#0000
No, i know that in Spain the uses are different. We speak like shit in the Americas.

[27-May-18 07:58 PM] emmanux#0000
In portuguese it's well differentiated as well. "Retrasado" and "retardado" are differentiated.

[27-May-18 07:58 PM] webalginet#0000
in américa is different

[27-May-18 07:59 PM] webalginet#0000
but, despite the error of the lightning network, the tweet has been retweeted by people with enough followers. It would be better not to erase it, what do you think?

[27-May-18 08:06 PM] emmanux#0000
it is going to be a great flop, more than it already is. For CHIPS marketing, i think that it is great, because it uses it as it should be. But not for Komodo. Just my opinion.

[27-May-18 08:06 PM] emmanux#0000
i personally don't want anything to do with LN

generally speaking we are trying to limit the number of conferences we go to to focus on rebrand and other fundamentals.

'building on bitcoin' sounds like an interesting name though 😄 That's what we do!

[29-May-18 12:08 PM] toycrane#0000
by the time blockchain become mainstream, what people love most is not bitcoin. bitcoin is neither fast nor and it is also less efficient. However, the optimized systems are likely to be connected to the bit coin in some way. bitcoin is strong and special.

To Those having Twitter issues....

Deactivate your account.   Wait an hour or two and log back in.   I am able to add followers now.   Let's see if they stick.

[30-May-18 02:28 AM] chinzoob#0000
Would it be a good idea or bad to approach every coin in the top 100 and join their telegram or slacks, and invite them and inform them about dPoW and notarizing to komodo? Like a little "Hey, just wanted to let you know that _______ and ____. By notarizing to Komodo, itll ensure you have btc hashrate this that, cheaper than notarizing to btc. We already have your coin on our decentralized exchange and can do atomic swap to any other coin"

Some copy paste message to all the coins main communication channels? Not in a shill way but genuinly informing them of the benefits, and giving them a contact link if theyd be interested?

[30-May-18 02:29 AM] chinzoob#0000
Fucked my back up so if its something that komodo would like to do, if anyone wants to write up a message id be willing to join every telegram/discord and plug us out while I recover 😂

[30-May-18 04:06 AM] ryan797#0000
Hell yeah.  Be a plant.  Start in with "Hey guys, how do we protect our coin from a 51% attack?"

[30-May-18 04:07 AM] ryan797#0000
And start planting seeds 😛

[30-May-18 04:33 AM] chinzoob#0000
Well if anyones able to write up a summary, with links to notarization page/dPoW and how it works, and a link to who to talk to if they are interested

[30-May-18 04:34 AM] chinzoob#0000
