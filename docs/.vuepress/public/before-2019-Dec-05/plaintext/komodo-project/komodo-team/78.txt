Will take that into consideration

@Dr Debt If only KMD had the DASH marketing team.  They were able to market the crap out of DASH (during its transition from Darkcoin) on much less tech.  Haha.  But that's ok, every team does things differently.  Low-key seems to the be the name of the game for KMD

[17-May-19 09:52 AM] richardt#2807
By investing/speculating on KMD, you're really hoping that one day the tech will finally win over hype.  Since KMD is open source, you're also hoping no other project out there with more funding/resources will simply just copy it and market it better 😶

[17-May-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
with a very fast evolving codebase, just copying it and marketing an older version would only help us

[17-May-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
also many aspects of the ecosystem are not possible to be forked, like the NN operators, and most importantly the entire ecosystem

[17-May-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
in this next phase, it is not the consumers that will drive growth, but rather the companies and projects that make the consumer products

[17-May-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are deciding to build a project on a platform, would you choose to use the clone? especially as the clone would likely be more expensive to use (to fund all this marketing) instead of the original? What happens if a bug is found, who will fix it?

[17-May-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
applying consumer product metrics now is too early

[17-May-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
when the wave of projects that build on komodo is making the consumer products, then is the time to measure the consumer product metrics

Welcome to the #komodo-team channel (this was previously known as #team-marketing).

We moved this channel up to this 'community lounge' category so it's more accessable. We archived other team channels so now it's just this one. In other words, all that discussion can now happen on this single channel.

We are also trying to improve the Discord experience and moved few things around. Let us know if you like the new approach and how we could further improve the user experience.

[17-May-19 02:26 PM] joe2x4#5987
I struggle with the same thing that others do in regard to the frustration of kmd price and perceived market value. It hasn't been very clear over the years exactly what sets kmd apart from the other coins. To the public the other coins are easier to understand and easy to market , hence easy to speculate. Kmd changes so fast is harder for the public to pin down exactly what it is, ICO platform, decentralized DEX, DPOW service, CC, etc. This I assume is why the Ideas by Nature was brought in to do rebrand. The harder concept to get across though seems to be kmd is advertising to projects as a place to build, and the projects through advertising themselves ultimately advertise kmd and userbase grows. The thing for anxious speculators to do seems to be either help advertise to new projects, or support the projects that are appearing so as they can naturally be the ones to market kmd. Ie: Help advertise chainmakers, pirate, k64, redfoxlabs, etc

[17-May-19 02:34 PM] Audo#5667
righ, we are trying to address this on the rebrand and think about how we should explain KMD – the currency.

I am trying to find the right concepts & words to describe what we have.

I think it's semi-public info that KMD will have sidechains. Any CC-module can be turned into a new KMD sidechain. The cool thing is that anyone can launch these sidechains, so it's truly open source / open / permissionless.

How should we explain this so that the average crypto enthusiast understands and gets exited?

Should we simply talk about "side chains"? But then that could be confused with all the other "independent chains" that we have on the Komodo ecosystem.

So I was thinking what if we talk about KMD "feature extensions", and that KMD is modular money that anyone can extend with new features (unlike the other coins).

Would that make sense? What type of words/language do you guys think would work here?

[17-May-19 02:35 PM] Audo#5667
also jl77 has addressed this general topic in his post: https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3

Tokenomics are for tokens, not for coins!

[17-May-19 02:37 PM] Audo#5667
Another concept I was thinking is to talk about how the *platform* and the *currency* are in a mutually beneficial symbiosis

> Most platforms are dependent on their ecosystem currency to power the platform; on Komodo it is not the case. Both the KMD currency and all the projects of the platform can exist on their own, yet they have a synergetic relationship.

--> then we describe *How The Platform will benefit the currency*

--> and *How The Currency will benefit the platform*

[17-May-19 02:42 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I think there has to be appeal to the non technical. If I’m trying to sell Komodo to an investor who really doesn’t know anything about crypto, telling them that it has asset chains and dpow will not win them over. However, if I say: they’re launching an online casino, a gaming platform and offering blockchain as a service to help incubate  other crypto projects (as an example) then they may be inclined to drop a few bucks.

[17-May-19 02:44 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I’m not here to criticize, I’m here to help if I can.

[17-May-19 02:44 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@Dr Debt agreed.  The marketing push needs to be for the easy to explain basics that get people excited.  Those who are interested in the more technical developments will seek them out.

[17-May-19 02:52 PM] Audo#5667
yes, so what do you guys think we we would say:

**KMD is the money of Komodo ecosystem that anyone can extend with new features and functionality** Then we list some of these feature extensions, such as stable coin extension, privacy extension, a decentralized casino extension, ...

then we can explain that any new technology that is developed on Komodo Platform can be applied to KMD as another extension.

Commodity currencies have fundamental value in their use

[17-May-19 02:56 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Komodo is your key to a digital future. With many features built on top of a digital ecosystem, this powerful platform will usher in a new era of creation and opportunities in the world of cryptocurrency.

[17-May-19 02:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Basically need more things to utilize the commodity , internally and externally.

[17-May-19 02:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It is slowly getting there though

[17-May-19 02:59 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Engaging writing and dumbed down explanations

[17-May-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents another layer written to summarize all the details and that explanation does seem pretty good

[17-May-19 03:01 PM] yorklab#7270
CowboyCrypto is on the right track, make it simple. The more technically capable will seek out the information they need. Most will simply move on if they don't understand it after the first read.

[17-May-19 03:03 PM] Dr Debt#0891
It has to grab their attention and leave them wanting to know more.

[17-May-19 03:06 PM] Audo#5667
Why will KMD succeed?

1. KMD is the base currency of our atomic swap technology
2. KMD can get unlimited amount of new features via side chains (that we could call feature extensions)
3. KMD has utility within the Komodo Platform such as through the Komodo Platform services (dPoW, soon interoperability)

How does the Komodo Platform & ecosystem help KMD?

4. Platform business & developer adoption brings in new technology innovations that KMD can adopt
5. Ecosystem business adoptio drives users to the ecosystem, which then likely become KMD users as well
6. Businesses & projects of the Komodo ecosystem can rely on KMD to be intermediary currency everyone uses and trusts. All new Komodo based products & services will likely accept KMD

[17-May-19 03:06 PM] Dr Debt#0891
This is where a community growth team helps. Someone who can explain it in it’s simplest way to people who don’t have a clue how this works. Education is a great part of building user base

[17-May-19 03:06 PM] Audo#5667
are there other points we could raise up?

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] Audo#5667
plus KMD is secure and scalable currency

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] Dr Debt#0891
I ask this question: If you gave me that response as to why I should buy kmd, why would I?

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Do you want to know what I’ve gotten people invested in Komodo with? Comparison to Eth. My angle is almost always the same: here they are side by side. Now Eth is xxx value currently but Komodo is only x, which multiplier will be better?

👌 

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Dr Debt#0891
In the end people care much more about money than they do tech.

[17-May-19 03:12 PM] Audo#5667
at least if I consider buying some coin I want to understand its usecases and why people would want to hold it. Do I need to understand Komodo Platform technology? Not really, if it's generally understood as a solid platform that is gaining business & developer adoption. Then I mainly want to know how KMD relates to the platform and why the success of the platform will spill over to the KMD currency itself.

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Sales driven marketing will do much more than tech driven marketing

[17-May-19 03:13 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Just my 2 sats

[17-May-19 03:14 PM] klein#5233
1> How is Komodo the base currency of atomic swaps?

[17-May-19 03:15 PM] Audo#5667
describing the Komodo Platform, its technology, and how it compares to Eth and other platforms is being worked on. That's the main focus of the rebrand and largely done. The marketing and branding message here is laregely developer & enterprise focused though

What I am looking to nail down now is the explanation of KMD as the ecosystem currency.

{Reactions}
👍 

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] klein#5233
my question is on topic and relates to the ETH comparison

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] Audo#5667
I consider the Komodo Platform to be little separate from the KMD Currency

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] Dr Debt#0891
But it’s not

[17-May-19 03:16 PM] Dr Debt#0891
It’s one and the same to investors

[17-May-19 03:17 PM] Audo#5667
Komodo Platform branding is directed to devs and businesses; KMD currency to the community/investors. Of course the community also needs to understnad how the platform works, you are right. That haven't been our focus so far though as the developer & business is our target audience.

[17-May-19 03:17 PM] Dr Debt#0891
You know why these shitcoins pump? Because everyone WANTS to get excited about something.

[17-May-19 03:18 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Developers and businesses will chase the users. If you collect them all within your community they will come to you.

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] Audo#5667
that's true, but it's also true that devs/businesses are looking for great technology. The rebrand will focus on pointing out how great the Komodo technology is and attract more devs/businesses. That should spill over the user side as if developers start paying attention to Komodo then so will the influencers, and then at the end the investors.

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if we have to choose between business/projects vs. end users, the former are far more long term

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the question is they are mutually exclusive

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] Audo#5667
we are about to launch a new landing page that introduces some of the new things we are working on. I would like to share the user ralted markeng materials with you guys little later on to get your feedback as you guys know about that and your feedback would be valuable.

[17-May-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a way to get end user sizzle without diluting the platform aspects

[17-May-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
"Komodo is your key to a digital future. With many features built on top of a digital ecosystem, this powerful platform will usher in a new era of creation and opportunities in the world of cryptocurrency."

[17-May-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the above doesnt really say anything and in a way many platforms could make the same claim

[17-May-19 03:25 PM] Audo#5667
yes, I think there is. With our current rebrand website structure we have a separate menu for devs/businesses and one for the community. We can use different language on the community pages.

[17-May-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe tweaking it to add the logic for expected growth, ie. no lockin, no gas, would make it so it only fits komodo

[17-May-19 03:27 PM] Dr Debt#0891
That’s my point James. I said nothing in a paragraph but still could grab attention instantly.

[17-May-19 03:27 PM] Audo#5667
the general story should be

1. Komodo Platform is awesome and will get business & developer adoption
2. KMD coin uses the same awesome technology and is secure & scalable
3. The bigger the Komodo ecosystem grows, the more usage and users KMD will have

[17-May-19 03:28 PM] Audo#5667
right? That makes sense in my head

[17-May-19 03:28 PM] grumpygoron#4320
I truly admire how skilled the team is on the technical side but when it comes to marketing those “buzz words” and basic explanations are what win.  Be cautious of worrying about technical details when it comes to marketing, otherwise you lose attention of the buyer

[17-May-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810

well, please don't judge us yet as we are not online with the rebrand 😃 

but yes we haven't had success in that regard yet

if the nothing could say a bit about how it is invetable that thousands of projects will build on komodo platform, that would be good

treasure 

[17-May-19 03:31 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Lol

[17-May-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
I think we can back up the claim that many projects will use komodo as it is superior tech at lower cost

[17-May-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and then the consumer headline can feed into the deeper content

[17-May-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so when people who dont believe such a wild claim start looking into it they start believing that many projects will indeed use komodo and from there the platform grows organically without artificial gas effect

[17-May-19 03:34 PM] Dr Debt#0891
We like to think of Komodo as a metropolitan city with asset chains being small communities within the city, and of course we have plenty of plans to grow in population. Within our community there are multiple projects under construction to become the pillars/foundation on which we shall thrive upon.

[17-May-19 03:37 PM] klein#5233
Why will KMD succeed?

1. KMD is the base currency of our atomic swap technology

[17-May-19 03:37 PM] klein#5233
How?

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
default marketmakers will make KMD trading pair markets

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] klein#5233
How is the KMD the base currency in BTC/ETH

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] klein#5233
BTC/USD

[17-May-19 03:38 PM] Audo#5667
Think of Bitcoin & centralized exchanges.

CEX can use any coin as the intermediatery currency, but yet they always tend to use BTC.

KMD is in a good position to be always used as is very secure thanks to dPoW and fast blocktime unlike Bitcoin

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
not all trading pairs will have KMD

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] klein#5233
Its obvious thats its not

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but there will be all KMD trading pairs

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] klein#5233
its self evident

[17-May-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the goal is to provide all KMD trading pairs with liquidity

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] klein#5233
The overwhelming majority of all traded volume in all crypto currencies in traded in the top 10 coins

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] klein#5233
nothing to do with komodo

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] Audo#5667
BTC, ETH, and USDT can be said to be the base currencies of centralized exchanges, right?

When it comes to Komodo DEX we could too have several base currencies, KMD being the most used (very likely)

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] klein#5233
How will komodo the coin benefit from such transactions

[17-May-19 03:40 PM] klein#5233
.... it won't

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] Audo#5667
why would I use BTC with atomic swaps if it takes ages thanks to 10 min confirmation? Also higher tx fees

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
liquidity creates value for the coin that is liquid

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
how else to explain LTC

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] klein#5233
agree

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD will get liquidity, KMD will benefit

[17-May-19 03:41 PM] klein#5233
The elephant in the room is this:

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying that the top 10 wont get liquidity, but the effect on KMD will be disproportionate

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] klein#5233
The overwhelming majority of all traded volume has nothing to do with komodo

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] Audo#5667
it's also the job of our community to promote & support KMD trading pairs in the begining and ensure that we got liquidity

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] Dr Debt#0891
Why will kmd succeed?

We will succeed through adoption. Through creating a user base that developers can access via our community. P2P transaction along with  b2b and b2c transactions will allow us to scale tx speed along with user base as we gain traction. This creates a snowball effect. While you may not notice a few flakes of snow now, you cannot ignore the avalanche that is inevitable.

[17-May-19 03:42 PM] klein#5233
In a way you mainly serving an existing customer base with KMD base pairs

[17-May-19 03:43 PM] Dr Debt#0891
If that was the answer I’d buy spot
