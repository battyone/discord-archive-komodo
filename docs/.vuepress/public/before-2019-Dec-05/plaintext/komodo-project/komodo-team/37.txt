Should we plan a Komodo week? üòõ  Don't know how well it would work out, but say we have 10 or so contributers with good karma reddit, and we get them all to pre-write an article or material about Komodo, and we get them to post it onto reddit cryptocurrency, cryptotechnology, cryptomarkets etc etc within the same few days.
So sort of a planned mass awareness program, cause if your regular joe sees the name "Komodo" a few times, I'm sure they'll take notice.
Maybe similar to chainzilla where we do a smaallll bounty for commenting something useful on it, so we can have a couple comments/likes and bring the articles up to the top. Our reddit presence is pretty small and generally gets shut down pretty quickly or removed LOL. 
Would be good to see a few articles flooding reddit and blockfolio news

[16-Aug-18 12:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont know much about tech or how things work, but the fact we are the only blockchain with crypto conditions (I think) sounds like pretty big news, our tx/s was largely ignored, and dPoW for other blockchains is still unknown and misunderstood. Would be nice to see it all come together üòÆ

There is a plan for a large marketing push, however we're coordinating and ensuring we've got timing and all the content ready so it all aligned.

We will share more details with the community next week. I'm working on getting additional AWS funding and advancing the partnership to the advanced tier. This will allow us to get a joint press release and a quote from an AWS exec sponsor. I've been talking with mainstream media and influencers so once we hit the 1M milestone, we can get coverage all at once and it'll be much harder to miss.

People like getting something for nothing in my experience :) I recently stumbled onto the Electroneum wallet for Android. It benchmarks your phone then fake mines a nominal amount of coin - but I do find myself keeping it running in the background and having a glance at its progress now and then (it barely used any resources) Could this be something an android wallet for Komodo could incorporate? Kinda like staking without it actually doing any work?

[16-Aug-18 02:53 PM] xRobeSx#5136
make an app to do it üòÉ

[16-Aug-18 02:54 PM] figgy132#7531
It could work out good if you have 100k 'miners' offered a nominal bounty to upvote something.

[16-Aug-18 02:54 PM] figgy132#7531
Beyond my scope and time at the minute :)

[16-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Idk why that just reminded me of BURST. Anyone remember that coin? They had Proof of Capacity which, idk how well it worked but it was a cool concept. IIRC it basically mined coins based on the available hard drive space you had.

[16-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Regnar#6164
So even cellphones could mine just by the available space on the device, throw a 128gb sd card in your samsung s5 and you could mine. or plug a 2 TB external hard drive into your laptop and mine. I wonder if a mining algorithm like that would be a cool feature for Komodo AC to choose from?

[16-Aug-18 03:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Regnar yea i remember that. It was a cool idea for an algo. Implementing new algos into AC parameters is a cool idea. Its just getting people to code it ha I know verushash will come back to KMD assetchain's eventually.

[16-Aug-18 03:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep and they claimed to do first smart contract or something like that back in those days üòÖ

[16-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I'm in the camp of offering as many algos as possible. But of course I'm not really a programmer and don't have the capability to do these myself and understand it is difficult to implement it. but from a marketing standpoint its an awesome idea to have a DIY chain launch service just clicking the box on things like algorithms, coin supply, block size, etc.

[16-Aug-18 03:18 PM] Regnar#6164
haha I'm not going to talk about Burst too much, I don't have any or invest in them either, but I do understand why some investors would want low energy mining. Hell they stopped allowing asic imports into a bunch of countries specifically because they don't want people to not use their fiat. Having mining via cellphone is a cool idea. then again it becomes trivial to mine via cellphone when you can hold a coin that gains 5.1% rewards üòõ

[16-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Regnar#6164
Trivial in an income sense, not network sense

[16-Aug-18 03:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Compare a PHP progrramer and a CMS user like wordpress. Both have their own place and need in industry. CMS drives more quick adoption, core devs innovations.
In that analogy I want both types the more in KMD.

[16-Aug-18 03:48 PM] dudezmobi#1945
nice

[16-Aug-18 04:11 PM] Regnar#6164
I think that's something people don't realize about open source projects, it's not as easy as just copy and pasting lines of code. There is much more to it, specifically the level of expertise and intimate knowledge of that code, how to fix issues, what every line means, etc. We all know how Google and Amazon works, we have their full blueprints, business model, structure, everything. Yet it's nearly impossible to replicate. It isn't about just having the bricks and blueprints to build something, it's about knowing how to do it and understanding how to adapt to variables in design, how to modify as it needs, and how to constantly improve. Anyone can copy an open source project and think it's just as good, or change small things like coin supply, block size, add a privacy feature, launch a blockchain from their desktop, but if you have something, anything on the line with the success of that project. It's best to work with those who know what they are doing.

[16-Aug-18 04:42 PM] Regnar#6164
except we could have something like a single chain running showing TPS and then you could "add chain" and it would show how the increase in TPS would result and show what is done with merkle roots etc.
