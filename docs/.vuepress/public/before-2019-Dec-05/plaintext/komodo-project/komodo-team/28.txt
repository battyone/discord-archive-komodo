yes, also russian speaking market are pretty tech savvy. So we might get more developers and new projects building on AC as well

[26-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
currently we have  korean, chinese, english , and a tiny Indian exchange üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 01:47 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and this is the biggest Indonesian exchange that is also a community of its own https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/indodax/

for Indodax listing. though not sure how to define "vivid" and "reliable" I'd say JL is quite a bit of both üòÉ

I was looking at the ARK commits during the bear period and it seems they dropped a lot

[26-Jul-18 06:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
While kmd commits kept rising

[26-Jul-18 06:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume this is the case for a lot of altcoins

[26-Jul-18 06:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is there a simple way to make a visualisation in one graph that shows the number of commits for different coins?

[26-Jul-18 06:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Didnt really see a way to extract the data

@webworker01 how important and meaningful is this rating?

[26-Jul-18 08:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I heard the team is testing masternode implementation  , is that true? If yes then probably it should be added on the features list as well @Daniel CP

cool bean, no problem, I was just browsing btt and a lot of projects out there like to have masternodes. So it could be a great selling point as well on top of all the other great features.

[26-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Audo#5667
@PTYX / @siu - Chainmakers , do you guys provide some master node implementation option in regards to Komodo? If yes, then we can include it ‚Äì if not, then it's not ready for marketing.

I just vaguely remember there have been some talk of using your own set of 'master nodes'. I guess that is what verus did with their KMD "fork"?

[26-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
BNTN plans to have masternode on their roadmap as well

[26-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Seko#7408
@webworker01 I agree...üëçüèº

[26-Jul-18 08:53 AM] gcharang#6833
`masternode implementation` is a possibility for assetchains that have CryptoConditions enabled. The `rewards` part of it has been written in its simplest form and needs to be tested. The other parts of a `masternode` might come in the future. All of this is currently in development and can be followed in the #cc-general channel.

[26-Jul-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
what about masternodes makes them popular?

[26-Jul-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I have heard it is the ability to lock funds to earn rewards and all the other parts of the masternode is not really that much of interest.

[26-Jul-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
if somebody can precisely describe what more than pure rewards CC is needed for a "masternode" CC, I can think about implementing it

[26-Jul-18 08:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
from what I read masternodes are like PoS stakers, they validate blocks and earn the tx fees and/or stake new coins

[26-Jul-18 08:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
for that network

[26-Jul-18 08:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
though there are many variants

[26-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
MGN/MGNX masternode has governance voting and of course the reward as well ( 80% rewards goes to node holder)

[26-Jul-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is not in a position to validate blocks (without major overhaul which I wont do), but it can deal with most other aspects

[26-Jul-18 09:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
dash has private send and instant send features on masternode

[26-Jul-18 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
all KMD chains have private send

[26-Jul-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
instant send is not really something CC can do

[26-Jul-18 09:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
probably can be implemented like zeroconf?

[26-Jul-18 09:04 AM] Mylo#8306
instant send is like 0-conf by the sounds of it.
masternodes lock the coins up.  and then everyone wants a masternode because it earns block rewards, raising the price.

[26-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@Gordon Komodo I await your design of 0conf CC implemetation as it is beyond me

[26-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
generally speaking you cant just combine buzzwords together at the code level

I'll read through the reddit post a little later today, thanks Dan.

[26-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Regnar#6164
just a quick question, I saw it was asked somewhere earlier but I don't remember the answer specifically. What is the reason behind the 500MM max supply for asset chains? integer overflow? what about if coins wanted to be non divisible but have high supply (kind of like NEO)?

[26-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Seko#7408
I got an answer from coin-hero.de. Unfortunately they have no capacities, but they offered ‚Äûme‚Äú to write a guest article.

[26-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Regnar#6164
also that compared to the optional premine of up to 10B coins.

[26-Jul-18 11:30 AM] Seko#7408
Coin-hero.de is one of the biggest in Germany,    at least with the best SEO...

Yea it definitely is spread out, but its also pretty cool to see some of the "higher" percentages, like India, Germany, and Nigeria! definitely some markets we could target more, @Seko  definitely on the right path with the German websites!!

yeah, I agree

[26-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Regnar#6164

I think the topics wise have been pretty well covered through official Komodo articles and would make sense to be the topics we write about first, even if it's not a direct translation, which you're right, is probably better with a german flair
