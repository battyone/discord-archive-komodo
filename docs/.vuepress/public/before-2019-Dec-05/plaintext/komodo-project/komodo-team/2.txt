Someone made an interesting point on how the notary nodes would handle a major worldwide Internet outage via a cut in the ocean-based communication lines. I made the best answer I could manage here.

Maybe a stupid question, but is it actually possible an entire continent would be possibly disconnected from the internet, but it’s not like there is only one connection from the US-EUR for example

[30-May-18 08:02 AM] polycryptoblog#0000
Reminds me of the arguments I get from my prepper friends,  " if an emp happens,  how's crypto going to survive that ".   If some major event like that happens that affects everything worldwide we got bigger problems

[30-May-18 08:02 AM] cryptoon#0000
The internet is a network, and if a direct US/EUR link would be cut, then the link would still exist US/SA/AFRICA/EUR

[30-May-18 08:02 AM] cryptoon#0000
Or something like that

[30-May-18 08:03 AM] polycryptoblog#0000
<@U8QKXKKBM>   Maybe Australia could be cut,  but yes there is more than one cable connecting continents

[30-May-18 08:05 AM] cryptoon#0000
Ok

[30-May-18 08:05 AM] cryptoon#0000
Aus cut not a big deal anyway :trollface:

[30-May-18 08:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Even Australia has a bunch of cables to other countries. And there is also satellite, however I am not sure NN would function of latency of satellite

[30-May-18 08:10 AM] siddhartha-komodo#0000
In the event that Bitcoin itself is bifurcated through a disconnect in our global Internet connection, once we reunite, Bitcoin's longest chain rule will automatically consume the smaller chains.

China's version of Bitcoin will most likely win.

The notary nodes that are based in Asia will have the correct version of the Komodo history, and the entire ecosystem will realign to their most recent states.

Everyone who was disconnected from the largest Bitcoin network will have been vulnerable during the period that they did not have access to the dominant blockchain sector.

If any particular area of the world is concerned about that, they should build out their Internet infrastructure.

[30-May-18 08:11 AM] siddhartha-komodo#0000
(So, in a rare event, and assuming the infrastructure stays as it is, an emp could cause an independent KMD-based chain in the Southern Hemisphere to lose a day or two of their financial history. This is far different than losing their entire chain from constant 51% attacks like GAME was experiencing, or losing everything from a Genesis Attack.)

[30-May-18 01:37 PM] imylomylo#0000
<@U8QKXKKBM> mid-east/africa got cut off from europe for a few days by an undersea cable cut about 6 years ago.  it happens.  the southern cross cable that links east coast australia to west coast usa links nz, papua new guinea, fiji, vanuatu etc.  not in one long cable but some octopus-like configuration.  if a ship drags anchor (or the intelligence community wants to splice a cable) one of those island nations can easily be disconnected.
same thing with rip/ospf/bgp routing protocols getting poisoned - cities and countries can go off air.

```Hello to the Komodo Team, 
My name is Omri Erez I am a developer, entrepreneur, and a Blockchain enthusiast. In addition, I am co-organizing a meetup series in Hamburg, Germany. We are currently running the biggest Blockchain meetup in Hamburg and would like to invite Komodo to present. Our meetup is held once a month. 

Here are some links: 
1. Meetup Group: https://goo.gl/wgmQPo 
2. Our next event: https://goo.gl/NgG3jy 
3. Our past events: https://goo.gl/nQ8yYb 

Some notes: 
1. All presentations are done in English as our community is international. 2. Our crowd is very mixed. Some with deep technical background but mostly people who are interested in the technology or want to learn more about it 
3. The main goals of the event is to exchange knowledge, grow your Blockchain network and to feel free to ask anything. 
4. We are organizing this meetup voluntarily, without any financial benefits and any costs are going from our own pocket. It will be great to have you! 

Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://goo.gl/SGaCD4) for any questions, commented, ideas and pretty much anything else :) I wish you a great day, Long Live our Distributed Future :) Omri```

When will the GAME dPoW thing be marketed?

[31-May-18 03:56 PM] siddhartha-komodo#0000
I think they're waiting to make sure everything settles.

[31-May-18 04:00 PM] jl777#0000
we are working closely with GAME, things are still being developed and as this relates to security, best not to be announcing all the details.ok?

[31-May-18 04:12 PM] cryptoon#0000
seems fair

[31-May-18 04:12 PM] cryptoon#0000
Although it’s a huge selling point for dpow

[31-May-18 04:13 PM] jl777#0000
is it worth delaying MoMoM and KMD 2.0?

[31-May-18 04:14 PM] jl777#0000
we can schedule adding new coins for the Sep timeframe

[31-May-18 04:14 PM] cryptoon#0000
offcourse not, was just wondering what the timeframe was and if it was going to be marketed

[31-May-18 04:26 PM] jl777#0000
I have asked to not be broadcasting this, but to quietly get interested coins. When I am happy with the integration result, then i will remove this restriction
