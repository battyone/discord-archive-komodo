It likely won't make a huge difference based on their coins they list etc. but it could set a positive precedent for other exchanges to look for the dPoW notarization to validate deposits.

@jl777c  I;ve seen you got pretty valuable account on steemit ! 😃 Not used for some time, maybe could be used for marketing purposes on steem (supporting KMD articles with Steem Power or sth) ? I believe many people on steemit are into cryptocurrencies (if not most) so that seems a good target media, at least oto publish every KMD article also there.

Something that just occurred to me.  
The bitcoin vulnerability discovered last week, how many coins were hit by the bug and suffered losses?   All those coins are prime to be added to dPoW right now.   Some are probably still fixing the issue or dealing with hacks.

[28-Sep-18 08:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have at least one coin I know of that would implement it ASAP.   Who should I talk to about that?

[28-Sep-18 09:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
(we're in the middle of creating a new pricing structure for dPoW but we'd still love to bring more projects on board. Only thing is, it's a bit of a process to integrate a new project so it can't happen too quickly. Will take a few weeks at minimum before a new blockchain is getting notarized)

@jl777c  this is naive marketing; I believe how you do it correctly is 1. you test marketing solution running it for 1 day 2. make another test run it 1 week, then 3. make 1 month campaing 4. continue if make sense 5. all the way monitor KPIs

[29-Sep-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
