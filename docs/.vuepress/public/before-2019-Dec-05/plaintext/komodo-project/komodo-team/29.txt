@Regnar yes, I agree. To begin I write an article about Komodo in general. Later to current topics. I mean, that is important, that we have an own article for BarterDEX, one for scaling test, secure, etc.

from what I read they're looking for a stop-gap solution before launch of the main TezosLibre chain

[26-Jul-18 06:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
an assetchain can work for that, though later they will migrate

[26-Jul-18 06:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the possibility of making a full Tezos-like customized assetchain is still in the future

that will be great if tzlibre dev can help customize and improve asset chain. It's a win win

[26-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Regnar#6164
Agreed, from my understanding there isn't too much that wouldn't be available to them as an asset chain

[26-Jul-18 06:26 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
or at least implement CC in Tezos, if that is too hard

[26-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
CC is still in it's early phase. TZlibre seems to have a lot of capable veteran blockchain devs.

[26-Jul-18 06:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@benohanlon the above will be useful in talking with them

[26-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not sure what Michelson smart contract is though " TzLibre has been created to run Michelson smart contracts with strong requirements of immutability and uncensorability."

[26-Jul-18 06:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
https://www.michelson-lang.com/ this?

[26-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Michelson is the domain-specific language used to write smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain

[26-Jul-18 06:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
http://doc.tzalpha.net/whitedoc/michelson.html

[26-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not a coder , but can AC be Michelson language friendly as well?

[26-Jul-18 06:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
what is AC ?

[26-Jul-18 06:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
asset chain

[26-Jul-18 06:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ah ok

[26-Jul-18 06:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
that is question for James, I think if they work from scratch they can add almost anything but it's likely going to take a long time

[26-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it could have been a platform within a platform , but I doubt that TZL team will do that üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't know enough about this to know if Michelson isn't possible on AC, or if it's something that could transfer over. It may have interop difficulties when it comes to cross chain comms, but again, not sure.

[26-Jul-18 06:40 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but if TZL is starting from scratch anyway, why not?

[26-Jul-18 06:41 PM] Regnar#6164
let's tag a dev in here who may have some better understanding regarding michelson and CC

[26-Jul-18 06:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think it depends on how far advanced Tezos coding is, if still early then it makes sense to study this possibility of working on an AC

[26-Jul-18 06:41 PM] Regnar#6164
oh there's JL haha

tezos whitepaper does not seem compatible with bitcoin protocol

[26-Jul-18 06:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and this settles the matter

[26-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah too bad

[26-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm going to read through their white paper in a bit, curious to see what compatibility issues there may be. Never know what these guys may be willing to work on, adjust, etc.

When it comes to this aspect, we'll focus on Bitcoin protocol coins, or erc20 tokens that are looking for a main net I assume?

[26-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, lesson learnt

[26-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Regnar#6164
We aren't pushing dPoW yet just because of the amount of work to implement it for other coins, but I think ERC20 coins or small bitcoin based coins could be interested in converting to a KMD AC for the additional features, scaling tech, and dPoW I think.

[26-Jul-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
we can start pushing dPoW now

BTCP might be a good one. Definitely needs it, just depends if we want the residual contact with McAfee?

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yes I think it is @Regnar maybe then McAfee would be forced to see kmd.

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] Regnar#6164
is that a good thing?

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] Regnar#6164

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea I‚Äôm not sure about it, I was kind of joking at first

Though he did "pump" Factom, and I'm a fan of that project

[26-Jul-18 07:20 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If it‚Äôs handled professionally and they are interested, then I don‚Äôt think it can be manipulated whether people like McAfee or not

[26-Jul-18 07:21 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, btcp dev seems to have a beef with kmd few months back lol

[26-Jul-18 07:21 PM] Regnar#6164
must have missed that one.

[26-Jul-18 07:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it was a tweet by DukeLeto, nothing to do with Kmd

[26-Jul-18 07:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think he coded replay protection for them, but they later changed it, he called them incompentent

[26-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Regnar#6164
isn't there Bitcoin Hush too?

[26-Jul-18 07:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

[26-Jul-18 07:24 PM] Regnar#6164
@xRobeSx any idea on a general turn around time on dPoW for a bitcoin protocol coin? I understand it varies, but any baseline would be useful.

[26-Jul-18 07:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i'm not sure the amount of code that is necessary to be added to the new coin, but james did it for GAME, so I'm sure the PR's can be somewhat copied to the new coin. 

Basically you just have to get all the Notary Node's to install it on their servers. That takes a day or so to get everyone doing it and synced

{Reactions}
üëçüèª (2) 

[26-Jul-18 07:28 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay so likely not month long, or something that will take too much effort away from KMD core development/scaling etc

[26-Jul-18 07:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and the amount of time it takes for the coin's dev team to accept the PR and update their network to the new code

[26-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I am assuming there would be a review period though, in which a KMD dev goes through their code to see if there is anything blatantly malicious or wrong in it that could hurt KMD or notaries etc

[26-Jul-18 07:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think most of it can be done without KMD core team doing much. The updates for iguana are minimal, its just getting the dpow code into the coin and NN's running it

[26-Jul-18 07:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes @Regnar thats important too. We've discussed it would be dangerous if the NN's just blindly install someone's coin and then update it without reviewing

[26-Jul-18 07:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I guess thats why james recommends legit dev team coins first

[26-Jul-18 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810

2 months to deployment is realistic

[26-Jul-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
2 weeks to deployment, while might be possible if it was made into absolute highest priority, it would create stress, derail all the other projects and not anything that makes sense to do

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[26-Jul-18 07:33 PM] Regnar#6164
Not trying to make false expectations, just had zero idea on what to go on. Okay sounds good, so finding viable projects will obviously have some type of priority set up. Is there something coin dev teams can do to prep themselves if they are on a "waiting list" or something? implement code but leave it inactive.

[26-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Regnar#6164
Not that I need to know that tbh

[26-Jul-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
they can look at GAME or CHIPS to see what it required. but once the code is done, it is a matter of merging the pull request and then doing a height activated hardfork

[26-Jul-18 07:40 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay, for dPoW services prioritize bitcoin protocol based on 0.11 or 0.15, with legit dev teams, and we can prioritize based on their social media presence, market cap, cost of attack, etc so that we can get some solid marketing from the integration. 2 month deployment is realistic but could be more depending on the project. Coin devs can look at Chips or GAME to see what is required (we should get the github links for them that show the code added just so we have it on hand).

Anything else Marketing? @xRobeSx  @KomodoWorld  @Gordon Komodo ???
