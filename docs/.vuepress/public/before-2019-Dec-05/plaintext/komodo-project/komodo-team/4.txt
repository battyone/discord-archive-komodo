Consensus feels like agreement.

[05-Jun-18 06:54 AM] jon#0000
It is agreement in a sense. It's using Komodo to help agree on the state of your chain.

Regarding the marketing of dpow of third party coins, i already suggested that but jl said best to focus on scaling and kmd 2.0 first to not drain too many resources away from that first.

[05-Jun-18 07:14 AM] cryptoon#0000
New dpow projects could be planned for september I think he said

[05-Jun-18 07:15 AM] jl777#0000
nothing against quietly getting coins into the pipeline

[05-Jun-18 07:23 AM] jl777#0000
just dont promise any instant results

[05-Jun-18 07:23 AM] jl777#0000
the work required would be a day of work from me, but more time for the coin devs to better understand dPoW

guys - I was at the Blockshow Europe in Berlin last week and we talked a bit at the Komodo booth there .. 
can anyone give me a hint  who it actually was that was there?

[05-Jun-18 11:08 AM] jl777#0000
I was there

were you that apparition above the booth?

[05-Jun-18 11:09 AM] locomb#0000
I talked with the austrian or german guy with the neon green spectacles - I thought his handle was @Audo but seems I mixed that up

[05-Jun-18 11:10 AM] regnar#0000
jl777 could split it's being into all the electronic devices at the show.... jl777 was the blockshow

[05-Jun-18 11:10 AM] locomb#0000
because we talked about listing an ERC20 token from a project I am invovlved with on Barterdex

<@U06LEAJBZ> or maybe ?

[05-Jun-18 11:12 AM] locomb#0000
maybe .. a  bit embarassing, I saw his picture on sveral  meetup fotos here in the past so I forgot to ask him his name (nerd fail)

[05-Jun-18 11:12 AM] regnar#0000
also do we like Komodo Consensus as a way of describing dPoW?

[05-Jun-18 11:12 AM] regnar#0000
no worries! almost no one here knows eachothers real names üòâ

[05-Jun-18 11:12 AM] locomb#0000
yeah but I dont know his name here either üê∏

[05-Jun-18 11:14 AM] regnar#0000
oh so not @Audo

[05-Jun-18 11:14 AM] locomb#0000
I assumed he is a team member so I thought I could look it up

[05-Jun-18 11:15 AM] locomb#0000
he looked a bit like Ben O'Hanlon, but that is so much a non-austrian name

[05-Jun-18 11:15 AM] regnar#0000
hmm maybe they will jump in here, people are all over different time zones so it may take a bit

[05-Jun-18 11:16 AM] locomb#0000
it may have been Ben, only I am so confused by the irish name

[05-Jun-18 11:17 AM] locomb#0000
<@U6ZR6LU4F> hi Ben- did we talk in Berlin at the Blockshow Europe?

[05-Jun-18 11:18 AM] locomb#0000
he was wearing that neon green spectacles is often pictured with

Do we like "Komodo Consensus # dPoW"  ?

[05-Jun-18 11:28 AM] jl777#0000
it is a question for Steve

[05-Jun-18 11:29 AM] regnar#0000
not as a name change obviously, but as a simple way of describing the function of dPoW as a notary service that involves consensus on what the notarized hash says. <@U6ZES59AA>

[05-Jun-18 11:29 AM] regnar#0000
bleh, its early, not sure if that came out right

[05-Jun-18 11:29 AM] jl777#0000
I only made a very small change to satoshi consensus rules, not sure it deserves its own consensus label. It even uses the same checkpointing process the normal inside the sourcecode checkpointing does, just dynamically, every 10 minutes

[05-Jun-18 11:30 AM] jl777#0000
but I have seen a lot of FUD about checkpointing being centralized...

[05-Jun-18 11:30 AM] jl777#0000
I dont really care what it is marketed as

[05-Jun-18 11:30 AM] regnar#0000
yea that is a tricky part, "64 nodes?! that's not decentralized" says the bitcoin and XRP bag holder

[05-Jun-18 11:31 AM] regnar#0000
but there are still miners in KMD

[05-Jun-18 11:32 AM] regnar#0000
well see what Steve thinks about it, I know Hansen, Fishy, Mylo and a few others were discussing it earlier today

[05-Jun-18 11:33 AM] jl777#0000
64 nodes running the same notarization dapp

[05-Jun-18 11:34 AM] jl777#0000
and the notaries will be the first to admit it is quite random which 13 notaries are selected for each round

[05-Jun-18 11:34 AM] jl777#0000
and 64 might be small compared to BTC but for a lot of the small coins that is almost as many as their entire mining set of mining nodes

[05-Jun-18 11:34 AM] jl777#0000
also BTC mining pools are much less than 64 to get majority hashrate

[05-Jun-18 11:35 AM] jl777#0000
before complaining about the centralization of another project, maybe best to make sure 6 mining pools dont control the majority of your hashrate

[05-Jun-18 11:35 AM] jusoaresf#0000
yes indeed!

[05-Jun-18 11:36 AM] jl777#0000
and before the maximalist retorts that each pool represents potentially thousands of different miners, I ask them, which of those thousands of miners controls the blocktemplate that is being mined?

[05-Jun-18 11:36 AM] jl777#0000
any of the thousand miners or the pool operator?

[05-Jun-18 11:36 AM] regnar#0000
yep, this similar problem came up earlier. the comparison may not be fair, but it will be made. so we just best prepare ourselves for an answer

[05-Jun-18 11:36 AM] jl777#0000
if it is the pool operator, then doesnt that mean that 6 people control the BTC majority hashrate?

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jl777#0000
and they would complain about our 64 notaries?

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] regnar#0000
like atomic swap DEX vs CEX for trade times...

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jl777#0000
I chose 64 for a reason

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] regnar#0000
which is?

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] regnar#0000
I don't think I know this one haha

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jl777#0000
it is a big enough number to be impractical to easily dominate

[05-Jun-18 11:37 AM] jl777#0000
yet it isnt so large that a N*N fully connected network wont explode with traffic

[05-Jun-18 11:38 AM] jl777#0000
64*64 is 4096

[05-Jun-18 11:38 AM] jl777#0000
128*128 is 16384

[05-Jun-18 11:38 AM] jl777#0000
256*256 is 65536

[05-Jun-18 11:39 AM] jl777#0000
so having 256 notaries is not only impractical from an elections standpoint as I doubt three are even 256 people who have the skills to be notaries, it dilutes notary rewards 8fold and increases network traffic 16 fold

[05-Jun-18 11:39 AM] jl777#0000
and still the maximalists would say that "only 256 notaries" is centralized

[05-Jun-18 11:41 AM] regnar#0000
It sounds like you recently got into a debate with a maximalist haha

[05-Jun-18 11:41 AM] regnar#0000
I don't often hear "Notary nodes are centralized"

[05-Jun-18 11:42 AM] jl777#0000
maximalists used to be a real annoyance back when BTC dominance was 90%, nowadays most are much more realistic, even if their rhetoric doesnt reflect it

[05-Jun-18 11:43 AM] jl777#0000
and dont get me wrong, BTC's network effect will ensure it will be here long term and KMD notarizes to BTC for a good reason. I am not against BTC in any way

[05-Jun-18 11:43 AM] jl777#0000
its just that some maximalists sound like fiat officials saying BTC is backed by nothing, as if all the fiat paper is

[05-Jun-18 11:52 AM] regnar#0000
value is subjective anyway, being backed by something doesn't matter if that something is worthless to me. *coughCough Toxic Mortgage backed Securities Cough*cough

[05-Jun-18 11:54 AM] regnar#0000
okay any marketing people, do we have a focus for the types of ERC20 tokens we want first? we looking for social media coins, industry/utility coins, altruism projects ?

[05-Jun-18 11:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
hmmmm there goes exponential maths...4000+ connections between nodes is impressive

[05-Jun-18 12:03 PM] regnar#0000
I'm kinda targeting Mithril MITH (decentralized social media platform), LIFElabs LIFE (1/3rd total supply is ringfenced for philanthropic causes, worldwide), Republic Protocol REN (decentralized dark pool for trustless cross-chain atomic trading of Ether, ERC20 tokens and Bitcoin pairs.) and DENT (Tokenizing the Mobile Data Industry to sell and buy Mobile Data with DENT Tokens)

[05-Jun-18 12:11 PM] regnar#0000
Obviously all long term and assuming we were to convert them, that's my thoughts

[05-Jun-18 12:11 PM] regnar#0000
I figured this gives us a pretty rounded erc20 conversion, if we can get them interested. They aren't each the Biggest chains, but more like SME. Mithril social media platform could help KMD and the asset chains by giving them better exposure, LIFE is philanthropic and from their twitter actually gives back money, REN is basically trying to make a "dark pool" version of BarterDEX which they could likely use the BarterDEX engine with tweaks if they are with Komodo, and DENT is just a cool project that is probably going to be seriously hurt by ETH gas prices in the future and could bring some more uniqueness.

[05-Jun-18 12:11 PM] regnar#0000
Also up for discussion, does "Asset chain" convey the same feeling as "independent chain" or some other variant?

[05-Jun-18 12:11 PM] regnar#0000
If you were an ETH token, it might sound more appealing to migrate if you weren't an asset chain, or something like that, it might come off as you are dependent on KMD. There might be a better way to describe Asset chains that is unique in crypto but still conveys independence, security, and freedom... I'll think on it today.

[05-Jun-18 12:23 PM] jl777#0000
parallel chain

[05-Jun-18 12:23 PM] jl777#0000
or just independent chain

[05-Jun-18 12:24 PM] jl777#0000
assetchain was named for the SuperNET assets that got their own chains, so it is a legacy naming

[05-Jun-18 12:24 PM] jl777#0000
maybe there will be some fancy marketing name for them

[05-Jun-18 04:54 PM] n2okpride#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> in the past we've labeled dpow as Komodo Security Services as an alternate to just dPoW. We can position it as an additional security layer to provide protection. We can also reference the analogy James used with 2FA, as it is an additional layer of security, but not 100% guaranteed protection.

[05-Jun-18 04:55 PM] n2okpride#0000
i think parallel chain still works from a technical standpoint, and as a means to differentiate from side chains.

[05-Jun-18 04:56 PM] n2okpride#0000
question is if we want to classify it as a technical marketing term - parallel chain vs side vs child

[05-Jun-18 04:56 PM] n2okpride#0000
or go further to brand it something like Scale Chain, Cluster Chain, Link Chain, etc, etc
