There's some lizards and dragon emoticons supported by twitter, but I'm not sure if there's a way to add custom ones

I just had a curious thought. If @KomodoPlatform could have a "mascot", what it could be? What does $KMD fans think of this?
I would love to hear. Even better, I'd love to see 100s or 1000s of variants community designed mascots of that popular $KMD mascot one day. #DevWis...

Any news on the rebrand? Seems its being going on a very long time

[02-Mar-19 07:51 PM] Audo#5667
Hey Sdunbar, thanks for asking. I would say there are three components that all must be finished. 
1) We have few different dev projects going on simultaniously, for example few weeks ago we gave this sneak peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaH8oR5nXpg
2) Business & product strategies have to be finalized
3) Marketing messaging & branding has to be completed

We have done good progress on all aspects, but none of them is finished ‚Äì and they all must be fully finished for us to go online with the rebrand.

Expect it all to still take time. We are not rushing this as it's important for our long term success. Our rebrand is not about marketing, but more developing a product and business development.

Hi,  fyi Komodo is still tagged as a privacy coin on CoinGecko.
(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/komodo)

[03-Mar-19 03:30 PM] yorklab#7270
I keep hearing how most of the real Bitcoin trading is on the OTC platforms; that's where supposedly most of the institutional investors are buying. Wouldn't Komodo's new mobile DEX (and desktop of course also)  be considered an OTC platform? When it's ready, shouldn't Komodo be pointing their tweets and advertisement towards those who rely on the OTC platforms?

@Daniel CP heya, thanks. Why, are you guys rebranding?

[06-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Many reasons. The rebrand is about much more than just a new logo and a new website. We're releasing a few new products and want to really redefine Komodo to accompany the go-to-market

[06-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Daniel CP#2020
It's about re-introducing Komodo to the industry in general. The rebrand will include new logo, new colors, new messaging, and new website, but all of that is really just to support and draw as much as attention as possible to the new tech and finished products

KMD and DPoW are mentioned many times in this "blue paper": https://download.emc2.foundation/docs/MIL-Coin-Blue-Paper.pdf

[15-Mar-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
What are the guidelines for external projects using KMD/DPoW brand in their materials? I see a trend where many projects are using KMD DPoW to market themselves, but have never spoken to KMD before, nor have paid for DPoW. It's concerning.
