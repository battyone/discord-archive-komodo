Is there a public marketing channel?

[25-May-19 01:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I had a thought today, even people in this discord do not have the time of inclination to follow all the various projects / things that are happening. I would like to have a discussion with people to potentially have not a infographic but a interactive map/dash board showing how each project fits into the KMD ecosystem and what updates we have coming out of them

[25-May-19 01:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think that will really show the breadth and depth of what KMD offers and it would be a very simple place to send people and have people monitor it for updates

@CHMEX what do you think?

[25-May-19 01:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Im thinking like those sites where you see 1 blob for a tx, then other blobs spanning out from that address, but instead have KMD in the middle then branches and sub branches, then showing all the tech and innovation and progress of it

[25-May-19 01:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe even a vision statement kind of thing for each project, what industries they will impact, what if we were to take a 1% share etc haha

[25-May-19 01:41 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Yes better being a solid project that lasts than the latest trendy coin that then gets dumped. And the KMD price is staying quite strong.

[25-May-19 01:41 PM] Lennart#9331
good idea, would love to show something like that to my peeps

[25-May-19 02:10 PM] joe2x4#5987
I agree that a site for advertising kmd ecosystem projects and products and updates and content and more would be beneficial. Put some advertising banners, etc on the site as well for projects to gain attention. Maybe it becomes the un-official KMD ecosystem page.

[25-May-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a good idea. maybe someone can get the cost needed to make such a site

@jl777c  cost is not the issue, gathering the info and how to design it is more of a factor for me. I will try to work on the concept and see what i come up with.

[26-May-19 04:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have been slowly tinkering on something like  this,  @hyperDEX  want to work on this together? I have komodocommunity.com a wildcard ssl so each project can have its own ssl sub domain and other benefits . And peepso , which allows one to roll out a social community with a bunch of features quickly.  https://peepso.com . Main issue is visual design, which is stuck waiting for rebrand.  Collecting materials won‚Äôt be too hard I think

I have been piecing stuff together for awhile now for a community site/project, to fill in some of the gaps that we have in different areas  ( marketing, bizdev, user acquisition, revenue streams, investment ).   I want to open this up as open to all community project.

Seems no comments, so I'll make one. The whole hurry up and wait for the marketing to begin but can't because the new theme is unreleased indefinitely is a little tiring. I believe there was a suggestion for an unofficial community site that can add some marketing firepower while we wait indefinitely for rebrand. Now I'm not saying I had the best suggestion, but it was one of the two. I wondering out loud  @polycryptoblog if your time isn't better spent somewhere else and a cookie cutter website run by ncrypt would be a good investment  towards community marketing and engagement that really needs to have happened already.

[27-May-19 07:45 PM] DeMarco#5676
Is there any kind of update from the ‚Äúidea by nature‚Äù team. Seems if resources have been devoted there already some kind of delivery timeline would be fair no?
Then if a more community biased patch is needed....seems like Kmd is all ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù which is valuable but not how this industry functions

[28-May-19 06:23 AM] Malti#3948
Maybe one of the ideas by the top tier marketing firm ideas by nature is to not leak any of the information/rebrand/deliverables as that impacts marketing in a positive way

[28-May-19 06:23 AM] Malti#3948
Imagine that

[28-May-19 06:23 AM] Malti#3948

I'm not saying that a web site is a bad thing or that it can't be useful, just saying that it's not as meaningful as some seem to think/feel

[28-May-19 02:35 PM] Mylo#8306
hi - yes it is probably a long wait.  in march/april - we were still testing a lot of the tech, so understanding what was going to be gold and what was going to be brown sheets was very important.
docs, dex app, multi-coin wallet, chain generator, application logic on chain, anti fud, dpow, mm2 = rebrand
all the work has to align so it's an appealing project to adopt.
some of the code is still being tested, so knowing what is marketable & usable is a 2-way street.
there's a lot of tech, and the rebrand is part of the new standard in blockchain tech.
james made some incredible stuff happen over the last 3 years that built on the previous 3 years.
komodo has one last hard fork to come and new notaries before it's never looking back.   imo anyway.
a) don't want brown sheets
b) don't want vapourware
c) want to manage people's expectations that use the tech
if you are not using the tech, ask questions how to use it.  spin up your own blockchains, make a tokendex, lock up some of your custom coins for rewards like a masternode network.
there is a crypto price competition to do with the prices of forex, stocks and other cryptos that some of the techs are working on as well.   prices of stocks & forex in crypto, all blockchain enforced.

[28-May-19 02:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Except that the entire delay hold back everything else,  because imagery all changes,  terminology is all changing ( why, who knows ),   So every other aspect of marketing gets held back,  no marketing materials,  no consistent messaging ,  no acquiring personnel to get the word out.

[28-May-19 02:42 PM] joe2x4#5987
As craptacular as Bitcointalk is, in the beginning it provided a wealth of information and support for btc. Who set that up, Satoshi? Once altcoins came about, BTT went steadiy downhill but was still the defacto place to get crypto info. I believe we are well beyond the chat forum, and kmd ecosystem is it's own beast and needs a way to display its ecosystem to the world. Heck, there are people on discord that have never even heard of chips

[28-May-19 02:51 PM] Mylo#8306
also things like partner networks are being revised, what is a training partner, what is an integration partner, a reseller, a tech partner and a cloud partner.   these things don't exist in current komodo nor many other projects.  understanding how to put brilliant tech together into a form that pros can use.   we have one-shot at a rebrand.   one-shot to wow a lot of eyeballs at once.

yeah forums are good, one of my tasks is how to integrate it more effectively.   initially i had created a demo community site with single sign on with the forum - this was not originally unleashed because of the above - aligning everything so it all is a cohesive message.

the earliest versions of a cohesive message were mid 2018, komodo lowers the barriers to blockchain adoption, you spin up your chain, you get your coins into a wallet, you get listed on a dex.   the message now is you get security, scalability and a bunch of new stuff out of the box.

How‚Äôs progress going on the website updates / rebrand?  Anything able to be reviewed by the public soon?

[01-Jun-19 06:57 AM] Mylo#8306
internal deadline for technical documentation is looming bu tthis does not mean the rebrand, tech docs is part of rebrand.
there is a campaign due to start soon.
14 hours ago internal team got the final beta to test before public beta - that will probably take the weekend and a day or two to thoroughly make acceptible for release.
the marketing messaging has been "nearly final" for most lines of business/products/software for a couple of weeks.
that polish going from nearly-final to final is a fine line when it cuts across many parts of the project, not just the "coin" and when we are doing a rebrand, the message is not just some upgrade to tech, it's a leading role in crypto adoption (in my humble opinion)

with that running, then sometime this week or next week maybe we can find some updated docs to run the marketmaker2 and test that.   depends on time.
the mobile dex app, you'll see some other addresses starting with `b` doing swaps on monday for testing - so maybe ask mid-next week again

[01-Jun-19 08:11 AM] Audo#5667
Yeah just a couple quick updates
 - Evolution campaign going live next week
 - AtomicDEX mobile is working and we are expanding the group of testers. Tested it myself too! We are also looking for opportunities to hold private demos for journalists, etc. before we start the full public beta.
 - We will decide the full public AtomicDEX beta launch date next week.
 - We have been working on the rebranded site and we have internal target dates.

Rebrand is getting closer but will still take time

sea is a source of international order. without the concept of sea lanes, not only can the spirit of the West be incomprehensible, but the source of modern international relations be incomprehensible.

money that pirates demand for ransom is called "real money," and the money that pirates recognize is a source of imagination: Trustless Trust. 

argument that bitcoin should be eliminated because criminals use bitcoin is logically not far from the idea that Venice's money should be removed because pirates have acknowledged it.

"bitcoin phenomenon," a strange phenomenon faced by mankind today, is different from the new industrial technology commonly referred to as blockchain. this phenomenon is clear and humanistic intellectuals who have missed bitcoin must admit that they have a narrow understanding of the source of the currency.

today, the complex international relations we face also have to do with changes in the marine order. bitcoin also exists as a result of the old order, although it may be the cause of the new international order.

It was the conclusion reached in 2014 that bitcoin was not a "happening" and its roots were unexpectedly very deep and sound.

now is the time for the humanities and knowledge communities to deal with the formidable phenomenon of bitcoin.

[01-Jun-19 02:55 PM] designer#4893
I think we shouldn't rush to an economist to understand the bitcoin phenomenon. Rather, I am sure that very humane books such as Nanami Shiono's Eastern Mediterranean Trilogy after Rome, Sapiens of Yuval Noah Harari, and The Rise of Christianity of Rodney Stark provide clues to the insight.

"That's enough" and "Our competitors are like us," maybe I can fool myself, but I can't fool the market. You have to make the perfect product. If you're going to make a clumsy product, go home and sleep.
Germany cares about the 0.1 mm difference, Japan is talking about 0.3 mm and the United States is talking about 0.5 mm, but China cares about 1 mm. That's why the word German engineering is still meaningful on the hardware side, and China has to make more efforts for this reason." That's how much Germany and Japan put great effort and effort into pursuing perfection, and the market seems to be well aware of these subtle differences, although they are all the same on the surface.
Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto applied the principles of microeconomics to the existing cryptographic technology and included people to form the most robust system created by mankind.

Greetings,

I wanted to shoot out a message to members of the Komodo team and community to see if you would be interested in recording a podcast for my week long podcast series of the Komodo Project. 

I recorded a podcast with two Komodo team members several weeks ago and it was a big success. Many people contacted me asking to create more episodes and I would love to bring on anyone who is interested. Here is a list of topics I would like to create a podcast over, each topic would be its own podcast:

-Why Komodo is a better blockchain solution
   --Blockchain difficulties, scaling issues, problems Komodo solves, etc

-Antara
  --What Antara is, it's frame work, smart-chains, why its a superior solution, etc.

-Komodo economics
  --Token supply, POS, staking, price outlook, scarcity, etc.

- How to customize your blockchain
   --How its done, why its important, how business can adopt this solution, etc

-Blockchain Web app on AWS
   --How to use it, how business can adopt it, etc

PM me if interested or shoot me an email at drew@crusayder.com
