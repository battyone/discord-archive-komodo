There is still a join us on slack paragraph. If somebody can replace it with discort whenever there is a bit of time would be great.

ok, sounds good

[20-Jun-18 01:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it's actually the most important ANN for those who want to stay up to date, should use @channel for that

[20-Jun-18 01:32 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or even better - do ANN in every channel in slack that slack won't have most interesting valid and up to date informations since no on any more -> all information possibly impacting trading aka "trading secrets" only on discord üòÉ

Can anyone confirm a partnership with O' Crypto Union? Was told to ask here

[22-Jun-18 04:01 PM] PTYX#6840
not that i have heard of

[22-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Mister.G#3159
Are you part of the team?

[22-Jun-18 04:02 PM] Mister.G#3159
They have it advertised in a PDF

[22-Jun-18 04:03 PM] Mister.G#3159
But I can't see anything official anywhere else

[22-Jun-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> Crypto Union is present in the Komodo Meetup in Switzerland. Not sure about a official partnership but they have some reps here.

[22-Jun-18 04:40 PM] Mister.G#3159
They have it advertised in their position paper

[22-Jun-18 04:41 PM] Mister.G#3159
wanted to know if Komodo team can vouch for them?

https://ocryptounion.io/

[22-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Mister.G#3159
Last page of the position paper has it there

[22-Jun-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the komodo team should be vouching officially for any specific external project. All of these projects are out of the control of komodo team, so they can change at any time. then again, it could be the best new crypto project around. Please research and make your own decisions. Being a tech provider, we can provide the tech, but we cant be put in the position where we are expected to identify all the possible problems with a project. Many projects are run by former (or even existing) team members. Such projects can certainly mention these things. Also, if we find anybody making false claims, we will call them out.

[22-Jun-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
in other words we are taking a step back from making formal partnerships, especially since in a decentralized project it doesnt really make sense. that being said, i expect projects will do partnerships, contract work, etc. with the various ecosystem companies

I know this doesnt make it as easy as possible to find the investment values, but at least the number isnt so large, it is still possible to research each of them as they arrive

[22-Jun-18 05:17 PM] Mister.G#3159
I completely understand and I don't expect you to vouch for anyone that uses the Komodo name. The thing is, if a project claims to have a partnership I assume the best way to identify the validity of this is to a) ask the project making the assertion or b) ask the Komodo team.

[22-Jun-18 05:18 PM] Mister.G#3159
I am simply asking whether the paper they have claiming that Komodo is a partner is true or false?

[22-Jun-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
I am not aware of any partnership

[22-Jun-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
however I am not aware of all things, so that isnt a definitive thing.

[22-Jun-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
best to ask them what exact partnership they claim to have with komodo

[22-Jun-18 05:20 PM] Mister.G#3159
I can't get any straight answers

[22-Jun-18 05:20 PM] Mister.G#3159
That's why I came here

Sorry to put you on the spot like this btw

[22-Jun-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
there isnt a formal partnership contract, but there is an understanding to work together

[22-Jun-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if all the external factors are solved, then there very well could be. they havent been solved yet and it is not up to me to solve them, so I cant say anything on that

[22-Jun-18 05:26 PM] Mister.G#3159
Thanks for the detailed explanation. Of course, I won't invest in their project based on the Komodo name and I will do my due diligence. I just had concerns about their project and wondered if they had been vetted (so to speak) by the team. I am invested in KMD and having your name attached to a project definitely eases these concerns. But I will wait until something concrete is established. Thanks again.

I'm pretty happy with the timeline from today. Informal unplanned chat, you crushed it with that article, we got the informal chat on reddit within minutes of it happening, and all the references links needed for your article were ready in no time, and official Komodo twitter (and many Komodo unofficial twitters) are sharing links and retweeting it shortly after. This is what well oiled machines do, not bad for a decentralized group of people. üëç
