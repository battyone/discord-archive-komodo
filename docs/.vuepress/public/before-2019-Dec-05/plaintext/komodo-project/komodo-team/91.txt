Hey @Regnar , yeah, we indeed have few case studies in making. üòÉ

[01-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Audo#5667
yes, if anyone has industry specifc knowledge and would like to work with us to map out how Antara Framework please reach out. We are looking to document solutions (e.g. how a supply chain solution could be built with Antara Framework)

[01-Aug-19 07:24 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I am not versed in the field, but a project about financial credit history and credit score (replacing equifax etc) . I would think it is easier to accomplished using antara framework as it requires multi-chains (maybe?) and CCs (oracles , outside data etc ) üòÑ If anybody wants to research on that and improve on it

[01-Aug-19 09:54 PM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe this is in the world of supply chain. But it would be great to see a system that connects small farmers with product manufacturers/distributors/end users via contracts for delivery that uses escrow, reputation, stable coins, and oracles.

Problem it solves, it would encourage small farmers to expand into new crops. It also provides a way for distributors and manufacturers to link with farmers and fill orders more effectively.

MSME (Micro Small Medium Enterprise) hub is a great use case

Most major consulting firms have case studies, this is likely the better approach for us. Businesses are often reluctant to try to implement solutions on their own and prefer to use consulting firms. Considering Komodo Antara is a tool set to custom make solutions, we should look to get consulting firms (of all sizes) to use Antara for their clients needs. 

Get them to produce their own case studies, offer workshops for consulting companies, etc

We have gotten questions about why K64 was removed from the website, and we wanted to bring little clarity to it. Simly put, the situation is that Komodo team is awaiting more details and information to independently verify claims made by the Komodore64 team before we list them as an official ecosystem project.

I got a question that led me to give a general answer about what our marketing team is currently working on. Here's my quick update for transparency:

When it comes to what our marketing team is doing, there are three focus points:
 1) product/solution marketing, technical marketing, tech comparisons
 2) community portal and community strategy to increase community engagement
 3) educational journeys and tutorials (in collaboration with support/qa team)

@acidbird I don't think there's a problem with staking. Make sure your UTXO are of sizes larger than 10 KMD. Lesser UTXO will not generate rewards.

NXT assets were migrated well over a year ago. You should check with support on that as well.

Hi everyone.  I have a question.  In both my Agama and QT wallets, it gets stuck on a a % when I open it  and it starts downloading the recent blockchain.  What do I do?  I have installed the newer version and tried a different wallet.

I can get a message to Roger ver. However, he will likely want something in return. Volume-wise, he might not find KMD appealing.

[02-Sep-19 05:25 PM] jorian#4555
what would that be? adding BCH to atomicdex?

Komodo is certainly against censorship and very relaxed about free speech but we do need to draw the line somewhere. 

Physical threats and/or lies that accuse others of criminal conduct without evidence will not be tolerated.

the k64 situation is delicate but i recommend ignoring it. we can't save everybody. the k64 situation is a delicate one. if the situation crosses over to legal territory, we should let law enforcement deal with it. otherwise it's just peripheral noise and a huge distraction from what really matters.

[06-Sep-19 10:59 AM] gcharang#6833
for nspv, there is no username and password right now
you run the client locally and interact with it using curl commands or the builtin html wallet
example: 
```
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "spend", "params": ["RFmQiF4Zbzxchv9AG6dw6ZaX8PbrA8FXAb",1 ] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$port/
```

[06-Sep-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
just use the html wallet from localhost, much easier
