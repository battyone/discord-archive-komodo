[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Pixelised#9067
@dukeleto Wish I didn't setup Agama to import my Hush coins yesterday. üò¶

[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Tek#5253
@FlyingDutchman im thinking about doing the same

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Pixelised you really *are* on the bleeding edge üëº

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how did agama get compromised is what im really wondering. arent localized wallets with privately held keys supposed to be secure?

no one answered is it fairly safe to send to exchange temporarily?

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] klein#5233
Binance make a shitload of money and has safu fund

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
does this mean we cant trust the software the team is rolling out?

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] deathsgrip#5269
Yes I want to know too, can we login to agama and just send funds to exchange

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] klein#5233
Binance could probably cover losses if there were any

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] klein#5233
* not advice

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] CryptoInvestorAU#8199
@Alright I hold OUR and ZEXO on a lite address. Address created in January. Am I affected? Could I just create a new address on native agama desktop and send there?

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Tek#5253
i need to build the ocean wallet and all

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] AkiraX#8269
Is my private key in agama fine?

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Tek#5253
its middle of the night

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] AkiraX#8269
Or do I need to move my funds

[05-Jun-19 01:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
I have downloaded and installed Ocean wallet.  I found two receive addresses.  I have test sent a small amount to one of those addresses.  I have never used Ocean before, so forgive me, but why is there no password or whatever when I launch it?  Its not a user friendly wallet at first glance

[05-Jun-19 01:37 AM] SHossain#0007
@AkiraX Move funds

[05-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
@deathsgrip create a new wallet prior to logging in then move the coins. 

@Exile13 any seed used in Agama lite mode within the past 3 months could be affected.

@jonnybbig Exchanges themselves are unaffected, but again "not your keys, not your coins"

@CryptoInvestorAU if you've logged into lite mode within the past 3 months, move all coins stored on the seed.

[05-Jun-19 01:37 AM] Tek#5253
i move to exchange for now

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] AkiraX#8269
I haven't created any seeds for a long time

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] jiraymond#5665
I don‚Äôt have the foggiest how to set up Ocean on a Mac.

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Exile13#4458
is there a native k64 wallet? cli?

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
im one second away from sending everything to agam

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Tek#5253
you need to build it on Linux and Mac

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
binance

[05-Jun-19 01:38 AM] SHossain#0007
@AkiraX have you logged in into Agama using any seed? if yes, then move your funds

[05-Jun-19 01:39 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i feel like our questions are not being sufficiently answered here. What is the compromise? How was it compromised?

[05-Jun-19 01:39 AM] CryptoInvestorAU#8199
Thanks @Alright. Yes, I have accessed it recently. So moving to native is fine yeah?

[05-Jun-19 01:39 AM] LordTricky#7840
what about private key / wif version 0.3.3a beta?

[05-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

@FlyingDutchman I send a small amount first....

[05-Jun-19 01:40 AM] meatspoon#7860
What about Chameleon wallet?  Ocean is giving me headaches

[05-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Tek#5253
@Alright is time important ? can I be hacked in 10 minuntes from now?

[05-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Alright#0419
@LordTricky should be fine, but better to move them if you can

[05-Jun-19 01:40 AM] AkiraX#8269
Not with a seed

I am unable to access through agama lite mode

[05-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Tek#5253
my kmd stack disapearing would ruin me

[05-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[05-Jun-19 01:41 AM] alamjx2#6901
Any idea how can I move my funds ?

[05-Jun-19 01:41 AM] Need4Speedüìà#3484
Wow

[05-Jun-19 01:41 AM] LordTricky#7840
@Alright  its 2:40 am and my agama is in virtual machine, i think it can wait till the morning, hopefully we find out what exactly has gone on for this panic fest by then

[05-Jun-19 01:42 AM] private guy#0631
I‚Äôve never done a paper wallet before, not tech savvy, is it easy?

[05-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Alright#0419
@LordTricky Better to do it now if you used lite mode within the last 3 months. 

@FlyingDutchman don't even have full details myself yet, please forgive the ambiguity, it's for the best

[05-Jun-19 01:43 AM] Exile13#4458
for k64, i can create another Radd through Coinomi or OceanQT correct?

running 0.3.5 agama, wallet won't open on lite or native to move funds, errors on both

[05-Jun-19 01:43 AM] Alright#0419
@Exile13 yes

[05-Jun-19 01:44 AM] jiraymond#5665
@private guy as someone who is also extremely unsophisticated in this stuff, if it‚Äôs really this immediately dire specifically for Agama I recommend doing what a couple of us dummies appear to have done which is just tossing it onto the first exchange or otherwise web hosted wallet you can find and riding it out for the time being.

[05-Jun-19 01:44 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Please remain clam and move your funds securely.

**What wallet can I use?**

1. Paper wallet (best to use in offline computer) - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024508-paper-wallet-guide
2. KomodoOceanQT wallet - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
3. Ledger
4. Send to Exchange (if you trust CEX)

thank you so much for clarifying @SHossain

[05-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Pixelised#9067
@dukeleto, maybe you can answer but is it possible to send Hush to a Ledger wallet as it's a KMD AC?

[05-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Alright#0419
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô it does, but you can generate an address on any of them and send coins there. You can then later import that address to the relevant chains

[05-Jun-19 01:46 AM] private guy#0631
@jiraymond  what exchange can accept SuperNET?

[05-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Alright#0419
@Pixelised you can, but it requires a bit of work to recover them afterwards. Need tools to dump the WIFs from the ledger phrase

[05-Jun-19 01:47 AM] jiraymond#5665
That, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know.

[05-Jun-19 01:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
`git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo; cd komodo; sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl; ./zcutil/build.sh` on Linux, and there will be a lot of downloading. But the power of running a full node is like nothing else

[05-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Pixelised#9067
For the moment I'm installing Hushmate and generating a new address to send to.

[05-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Alright#0419
@private guy there is a market on coinexchange.io for SUPERNET, not recommending you send them there though

[05-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Dark#6473
man I got an old wallet, there a chain I can download

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] jiraymond#5665
Yes we know you can‚Äôt guarantee it but for the stupid crowd the non-CEX/hosted wallet options are completely untenable. It is what it is.

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
is it interesting to run a native full node wallet on a laptop? ?

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
I mean

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
in the past it gave me nothing but issues

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Tek#5253
I need lite wallets

[05-Jun-19 01:49 AM] SHossain#0007

Please remain clam and move your funds securely.
PROTIP: You do not need to sync any of the blockchain to make an address. Just start native mode, use `getnewaddress` call, after you get the address, use `dumpprivkey` with the address.

1. Paper wallet (best to use in offline computer) - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024508-paper-wallet-guide

@Tek i have about 5 full nodes running on an old laptop typing this

[05-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Alright#0419
It's fully possible to run a native node on a laptop. Right now you simply need to generate an address and back up the key for it

[05-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Tek#5253
I'll have a look at installing a native client then.. but not now cause its middle of the night  üòÑ

So I cannot move my coins because I‚Äôm on an old version of agama;, but the GitHub page is down to update .   Now what?

[05-Jun-19 01:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek if you install native node, then you get to hang out in #dev-general üòâ

[05-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Tek#5253
@dukeleto I'll install it tomorrow. I really don't feel SAFU with this much funds on binance.

@Riff when was the last time you used agama?

[05-Jun-19 01:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
