If you are using the Lite wallet (recommended), when you first load Agama it will ask you for a seed, or it can create one for you. That's your Key. Keep it safe, its the only way  to get to your funds. Copy the address, log out, then log  back in to make sure you see the exact same address, then you know you retyped (or pasted) the correct seed. You should send 1 kmd to the wallet first to make sure you can access it again. If you see the kmd you sent, then you should be good.

Vertigo already answered in #deleted-channel  if you need more information let me know through PM and I will come back to see your message on the channel ,   I will be out of desk for a while , if you were asking about encryption of the wallet.dat file in native mode , this is not possible due to Zcash standards https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/security-warnings.md , Komodo being a fork of zcash has this same standard. But still you could encrypt your wallet with a password in a separate folder or cold storage if needed each time you do an important transaction.

hello my wallet is stuck at block 952476

[17-Oct-18 07:56 AM] dokrates#8987
it says 0 connections, what can i do?

[17-Oct-18 07:56 AM] dokrates#8987
i did a dnat tcp port of 7770

[17-Oct-18 07:56 AM] dokrates#8987
but i still haven't connections

[17-Oct-18 09:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Hello @dokrates Which Agama version are you using and on which platform?

[17-Oct-18 09:18 AM] dokrates#8987
0.2.41d win64

[17-Oct-18 09:23 AM] TonyL#3577
@dokrates Please try to close Agama, stop all komodod processes (via task manager or by PC reboot). Then delete  %appdata%/Komodo/peers.dat and try again

[17-Oct-18 09:24 AM] dokrates#8987
done

[17-Oct-18 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you have any connections now?

[17-Oct-18 09:26 AM] dokrates#8987
now 1

[17-Oct-18 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Already better than 0 üòÉ  Are blocks continued to sync?

[17-Oct-18 09:26 AM] dokrates#8987
still at 952476

[17-Oct-18 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Wait a little bit - probably it's re-indexing existing blocks atm

[17-Oct-18 09:27 AM] dokrates#8987
show now connections 0

[17-Oct-18 09:27 AM] dokrates#8987
could you provide me komodo.conf?

[17-Oct-18 09:27 AM] dokrates#8987
because i modified it

[17-Oct-18 09:27 AM] dokrates#8987
because i saw all addnode belong to same line

[17-Oct-18 09:28 AM] TonyL#3577
```rpcuser=youruser
rpcpassword=yourpassword
server=1
rpcport=7771
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241```

[17-Oct-18 09:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be something like that

[17-Oct-18 09:28 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, it is

[17-Oct-18 09:37 AM] TonyL#3577
`i did a dnat tcp port of 7770`
Did you set 7770 in your config as well? 
If `komodo-cli getinfo` return no error it should be a connectivity error

[17-Oct-18 09:39 AM] dokrates#8987
you mean this should be rpcport=7770 ?

[17-Oct-18 09:40 AM] TonyL#3577
No 7771 in config is ok, I just not sure why you opened 7770 port

[17-Oct-18 09:41 AM] dokrates#8987
so, what port i must open?

[17-Oct-18 09:41 AM] dokrates#8987
to improve connections

[17-Oct-18 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
As I know for external connections komodod taking random ports, ports 7770 and 7701 listening on localhost for local RPC calls

[17-Oct-18 09:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Not sure how to make it on Windows but you just have to allow external connections for Agama by your firewall if you have strict network rules in your network

[17-Oct-18 09:49 AM] dokrates#8987
my host is running on private network

[17-Oct-18 09:49 AM] dokrates#8987
no firewall on the host

[17-Oct-18 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577
For example komodod on linux - two localhost listeners on 7770 and 7771 and 6 external connections to nodes for syncing

[17-Oct-18 09:49 AM] dokrates#8987
i must perform any dnat port?

[17-Oct-18 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure about your network/security configuration - just connections for Agama shouldn't be blocked by AV/Firewall

[17-Oct-18 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
These connections taking ports in range 30000-60000 as I know

[17-Oct-18 09:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to allow all in network rules for start and check if it helps

Hello, I am running Agama 0.2.41d-beta and  keep seeing "Unable to establish RPC connection!" - I have tried deleting my peers.dat -- chainstate  & blocks files and restarted agama. What else can I try to get my Native KMD wallet synced properly?

[18-Oct-18 02:24 AM] Hermes#6934
Have you erased the Komodo.conf file ?

[18-Oct-18 02:25 AM] sir#6225
I havent tried that yet

[18-Oct-18 02:25 AM] sir#6225
I see peers.dat 3305 and peers.dat8770 and peers.dat.ae40 -- should i erase these as well?

[18-Oct-18 02:27 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes erase those files the only necessary file is your wallet.dat file .

[18-Oct-18 02:30 AM] sir#6225
No luck after restarting

[18-Oct-18 02:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Can you check if komodod is being launched in the task manager are you using Windows ?

[18-Oct-18 02:44 AM] Hermes#6934
It could be that an actual could be that an AV could be blocking Komodod @sir

[18-Oct-18 03:05 AM] sir#6225
I dont think it is being launched

[18-Oct-18 03:06 AM] sir#6225
Doesnt show up in task manager while agama is running. I will try to disable AV

@Hermes

[18-Oct-18 10:58 AM] Nabob#5004
@ErikB please try to login to agama, to check your can reproduce original address

[18-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Nabob#5004
if your seed not reproducing right kmd address, you need to reverify your seed for sny typo errors

I submitted a ticket. my PC stopped working, and I wasn‚Äôt able to properly backup my wallet. 

I know the password I used, but don‚Äôt have access to the WIF. I have a 12 word file, but not sure if that‚Äôs it. I tried logging in w password, and the 12 word WIF, but it‚Äôs not recovering. thanks.

@kyle  i have an off-topic sugestion on this channel,  generally there many ways to recover any data even formated data , Best way to recover ur key and directory folder u can use Linux system and best opensource code to recover  data . I can ensure you "testdisk" is the number 1 for recovery any data at any time even Formated Part from ur partition disk  ..Hope it help

[19-Oct-18 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
@gigoplast 

I am following up in regards to using testdisk on Linux to potentially recover wallet files. 

anyone familiar with this process? 

I run the command to instal testdisk, and it says I unable to locate package testdisk.

[19-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Hermes#6934
ü§î  Haven't used this program but I guess is worth trying if you want to have an opportunity getting back the wallet.dat file...are you sure it works even if you didn't backed up that drive before?

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ive been chatting with a user for 2 hrs now trying to recover.

[19-Oct-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Linux installed and everything lol. big headache

[19-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Hermes#6934
I hope that I could help but haven't used this program honestly...Just be warned that receiving non official support it's something that you are doing at your own risk.  Maybe just in case you can contact somebody from the software testdisk that can assist you.

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am I able to reach out to a dev at this point?

[19-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I love KMD but the LITE/ Native versions of the wallet thru me off. I used to just sign in with a password, and now I lost all my coins. I tried for hours recovering.

[19-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Hermes#6934
If you used a pin to enter the wallet then you had a seed passphrase that you should have wrote when you first created the wallet.

[19-Oct-18 05:29 PM] Hermes#6934
If you used the native version of the wallet. The wallet.dat file had your private keys stored natively in your computer. You should had a copy of this file or a copy of the  of the address private keys that hold your funds.

[19-Oct-18 05:30 PM] Hermes#6934
You can be as careful or careless with your wallet, this is why we made a pin option to the lite mode version of the wallet and had all the disclaimers warning new users to write down their seed because that's basically your private keys.

[19-Oct-18 05:31 PM] Hermes#6934
I hope we could help more but basically if you don't have the wallet.dat , seed or private keys there is not much that we can help with

[19-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Hermes#6934
If you by any chance get back the data from your hard drive , it could be the only way that I see that you could solve the problem...

Can't get a agama on native mode says zcash parama are missing or incompetent. Done what it says to do and still says it

[19-Oct-18 05:59 PM] Hermes#6934
Which version of the wallet you are using? Make sure that the download is not being blocked by an AV of firewall...also try restarting the wallet and see if that helps

[19-Oct-18 06:00 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
V0.2.41d- beta I have no firewall active

[19-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Hermes#6934
try a restart and see if this helps, Which OS you are using?

Windows 10 pro

[19-Oct-18 06:02 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
I downloaded the wallet from the komodo website

[19-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Hermes#6934

[19-Oct-18 06:15 PM] Hermes#6934
make sure komodod is running in the background process , use task manager to see this process

[19-Oct-18 06:15 PM] Hermes#6934
it could be blocked by an AV or firewall.
