I am trying to run versus wallet on Windows 10 64bit in administrator mode.  But I get an error message "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.  You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."  And I am logged in as an administrator of this PC.  Is AVAST preventing it from running or Windows?

@Dom001 use komodo ocean for chips

[05-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Hammerstein#6697
@mrlynch so we need our private keys or f***ed?

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
private keys or seed yes

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
hope you have backups as standard practice

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] napa#5694
can someone plz tell me if u can earn rewards with the ocean wallet as u can with the agama wallet. am not sure if i created a seed  when creating my wallet in 2017. i have always used dat file for loading into native coin but i don't know if i should move to ocean to be on the safe side

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
@spudboy999 try running not in administrator mode

[05-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
everyone is freaking out millions of euros/usd its at stake

[05-Jun-19 03:10 PM] shewy89#1464
Couple of questions: 
1. As a temporary measure if I can see my KMD coins are moved out of my existing wallet into a Safe address, can I just leave it there and claim once I have created a new wallet further down the line ? 
2. If j see my KMD coins still exist in my agama wallet , Just for now , as a temp measure , could I just move my funds to an exchange and then move back to a new kmd wallet or update etc ? 
3. Can I apply option 2 to other ERC20 coins I had on Agama?

[05-Jun-19 03:10 PM] spudboy999#5256
@mrlynch   I tried that  first and got the same error

[05-Jun-19 03:10 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch I'm trying to transfer the other assets as well. But for all except KMD I get "Connection error! Trying to swich to another server" in Versus. How can I transfer them?

[05-Jun-19 03:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
@napa rewards are non-essentials at the moment... just move your funds

[05-Jun-19 03:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
@shewy89 1. yes
2. yes
3. don't know, try and let us know

[05-Jun-19 03:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
@spudboy999 does it say which path it can't find?

1) If your KMD in "Safe" address - please fill form and wait
2) If your KMD still in wallet and seed was generated/used in Agama - move it as soon as possible
3)  https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029942-get-an-ethereum-private-key-from-agama-
Please check this guide to get privkey for ETH/ERC20 (you'll find links for seed -> ETH privkey conversion script)

@Berg if a wallet vulnerability that they detected and trying to put a clamp on is a reason for u to sell kmd, then u might as well sell all of your crypto cos u don't know wtf is going on

[05-Jun-19 03:14 PM] K.M#8111
hello, which Verus should I download? Agama-Windows-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview.zip

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] TonyL#3577
@Berg you can use VERUS Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] ionstar#5362
I just noticed when I fired Verus edition up in native modfe, that it';s auto loading my old wallet from th eoriginal agama. Are you sure there's no cross contamination if I rename that old wallet and use native mode in verus using my new seed?

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Artist#0765
I had agama but I don't remember the seed nor the private key or stuff anyway?

[05-Jun-19 03:15 PM] napa#5694
@Berg no crisis. quit with the bs.

@ionstar  ```[discord] <jl777c> with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.```

[05-Jun-19 03:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Berg if you would've paid attention you would've noticed that i said use chameleon pay to restore from backup

@Berg I used the web wallet GL

[05-Jun-19 03:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ionstar verus agama uses the same wallet.dat for native nodes - you can use that to send to new safe address

[05-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Hammerstein#6697
@mrlynch mr. lynch, apologize for any ignorance here, but is there an option to restore hush and bitcoin-hush assets on chameleon pay?  I don‚Äôt see those coins there

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
if they're not there then no .. @PTYX can tell u more

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] PTYX#6840
if you have hush you need to export your privatekey and use it in a hush wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:18 PM] ionstar#5362
No, I mean if I rename the wallet.dat and use native mode with verus using my new seed. If there's no cross contamination (since it's the same physical system) (dunno why I cant quota here in discord)

It seems I cant download Verus from github. Anyone else having the same problem?

[05-Jun-19 03:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ionstar no... afaik bad agama **may** have had the ability to access priv keys from wallet.dat - if you rename the allegedly compromised wallet.dat and create a new one that isn't touched by agama you're ok

[05-Jun-19 03:20 PM] PTYX#6840

[05-Jun-19 03:25 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@KT the Agama wallet likely won't affect the Verus one, so I think it's safe to have both on the same machine, but to be sure I think you can just uninstall the old Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326 (pinned)
IMPORTANT: If you have swept all funds from Agama, PLEASE CLOSE IT. That will allow other people to connect to the servers. They are currently overloaded. THANK YOU ‚ô•

@PHBA2061 can i use my old seed on verus agama to send to new verus adress on same machine ?

[05-Jun-19 03:27 PM] shewy89#1464
So let me get this right : 
1. Download Verus from Komodo website
2.Generate new address and store private keys and seeds
3. Log into Agama wallet using old seed with funds and send to newly created Verus wallet ? 

Correct ? Simples
