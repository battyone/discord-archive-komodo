or, use the offline signing guide

[05-Jun-19 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
where do I get the offline wallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
if you had the Agama downloaded, you can use that

[05-Jun-19 04:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you told me it was unsafe, so I deleted it

[05-Jun-19 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i have solution fo ryou

[05-Jun-19 04:20 AM] SHossain#0007
use paper wallet

[05-Jun-19 04:20 AM] tolken#2655
Can’t get into Agama to move funds :/

[05-Jun-19 04:20 AM] LocoMB#8593
is the seed/address pair valid, even if AGAM0.5.6 keeps bitching? with errors

[05-Jun-19 04:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`use paper wallet`
link?

@locos  what does that error mean? I see that too

[05-Jun-19 04:21 AM] SHossain#0007
@LocoMB use VRSC lite mode to create a new address not KMD lite mode using Verus Agama

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So it’s safe for me to login with pin/litemode, send out into ledger or verus address now correct?

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes I did that- so this is good even if it bitches, a bit right?

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Is this in a rush ie drop my work right now and speed home

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or it’s fine mostly precaution (no ones actively abusing)

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Dyeles#8347
@SHossain , to my previous question, which one would you recommend, Komodo Ocean to create the new ones or VRSC

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] LocoMB#8593
VERIS AGAMA - create an address for VRSC coin?!?!

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] dudezmobi#1945
use this for easy info sharing.

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] dudezmobi#1945
its hard to scroll in discord

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] SHossain#0007
KomodoOcean may take longer time. VRSC agama is quickest

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] SHossain#0007
or paper wallet

[05-Jun-19 04:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What is the safest paper wallet for Bitcoin?

I had used the one previously that was compromised.

[05-Jun-19 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`KomodoOcean may take longer time.`
*than lite mode

[05-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think it was walletgenerator.net or something, and there was a medium article indicating it was untrustworthy.

[05-Jun-19 04:24 AM] LocoMB#8593
@SHossain so what is the diffeerence between VRSC lite mode and KMD Lite mode in VRSC AGAMA?

[05-Jun-19 04:24 AM] Dyeles#8347
Thank you

[05-Jun-19 04:25 AM] tolken#2655
Can I use Agama seed in Chameleon? @SHossain

[05-Jun-19 04:25 AM] SHossain#0007
KMD lite mode doesnt work for now on Verus Agama

[05-Jun-19 04:25 AM] SHossain#0007
due to electrum version upgrade on KMD electrum server

[05-Jun-19 04:25 AM] SHossain#0007
VRSC works, so you can create a new address

[05-Jun-19 04:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes but I just made an address in AGAMA0.5.6a - is that good or not?

[05-Jun-19 04:26 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that is good

[05-Jun-19 04:26 AM] SHossain#0007

@Bryan_Beus our paper wallet is not that one and paper wallet not meant to be used online

[05-Jun-19 04:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Our paper wallet doesn't do Bitcoin.

[05-Jun-19 04:28 AM] SHossain#0007
it does. you can convert your KMD address to bitcoin address

So quick question, if a user has multiple KMD asset chains, and uses KomodoQT, can they access the AC coins at a later date I assume either through (learning for me) CLI or a future Agama/other multicoin wallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And if so, then I assume we send all AC funds to that same R address.

[05-Jun-19 04:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Should Pirate users also move funds if their wallets were generated after logging into agama litemode?  I.E.  KMD litemode -> activate coin -> Pirate Native?
Thank you for your communication.

[05-Jun-19 04:35 AM] cipi#4502
same WIF = same address for KMD and all KMD assetchains... if you used that WIF to login to Agama SPV, then move the funds

[05-Jun-19 04:36 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain  - I still cant move my KMD from the beta version - I try the WebWallet and can see the KMD, but there is NO "SEND" option -- PLEASE help!

@TSW do you see balance on the webwallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:38 AM] cedric#4008
server is saturated for agama lite mode

[05-Jun-19 04:38 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain  yes, I do, but says I'm in watchonly mode

[05-Jun-19 04:39 AM] SHossain#0007
because, you used your address to login.

[05-Jun-19 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to use yoru seed or WIF

[05-Jun-19 04:40 AM] tolken#2655
@SHossain funds moved, thanks! Chameleon worked great.

[05-Jun-19 04:41 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain  every time I try it creates a NEW address, and does not show the true address that belongs with it

[05-Jun-19 04:41 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain and then I can't see the balance

[05-Jun-19 04:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain
am I correct in assuming the issue is in Amaga itself and not the accompanying daemon/cli?
if so, would actual daemon copied into VRSC agama dir not work and work safely?

[05-Jun-19 04:42 AM] kimixi#5955
I opened agama and all my komodos stolen

[05-Jun-19 04:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
OMG fud!

[05-Jun-19 04:43 AM] DingDongSoLong#0148
Am I screwed if I’m not able to move anything for 2 days

[05-Jun-19 04:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 native mode or accompanying daemon/cli not affected. if you copy daemon into Verus Agama, you can't use the Lite mode

[05-Jun-19 04:44 AM] SHossain#0007
@kimixi DM me your address

[05-Jun-19 04:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
what about PIRATE chain? should be not an issue because no LITE mode, correct?

[05-Jun-19 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I don't want to use lite mode, I want to transfer 5 addys across 27 chains and go to bed asap and I don't feel like scripting it all out

[05-Jun-19 04:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
scripting in that kind of situation is not a good idea indeed

[05-Jun-19 04:47 AM] kimixi#5955
Someone did transaction to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF

[05-Jun-19 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@LocoMB scripting is 1000x better, I just don't have the time

[05-Jun-19 04:47 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can use Verus Agama or any CLI daemon. also KomodoOceanQT for native

[05-Jun-19 04:47 AM] LocoMB#8593
I was talking about the stress levels

[05-Jun-19 04:48 AM] Dyeles#8347
Any feedback sending to Chameleon while I continue with Komodo Ocean

[05-Jun-19 04:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Chameleon, magnum, and guarda seem unaffected

[05-Jun-19 04:53 AM] PTYX#6840
Coinomi is an option too

[05-Jun-19 04:53 AM] PTYX#6840
I never recommend keeping more than a few thousand on a mobile wallet. Since it's a hot wallet, by default it's less secure than a Ledger or cold storage key

[05-Jun-19 04:53 AM] PTYX#6840
If you have a considerable amount of funds I suggest a cold wallet

what is this address?

[05-Jun-19 04:54 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain Please stay with me... When I login to the web wallet w/ the seed phrase, it goes to the wrong KMD wallet address

[05-Jun-19 04:54 AM] Dyeles#8347

@siu - Chainmakers what about that address?

[05-Jun-19 04:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
funds are moving there en mass

[05-Jun-19 04:55 AM] SHossain#0007
@TSW you are using wrong seed or it is malformed. same seed will always generate same address

[05-Jun-19 04:55 AM] n64#7103
both electrum servers down?

@SHossain it works on my desk top lite beta version

[05-Jun-19 04:56 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe someone panicking and sending funds outside of Agama

[05-Jun-19 04:56 AM] SVET5#3137
@PTYX  will it be a good option, if I move all my assets to Ledger. Will magnum/agama support Assets on Ledger  in the near future?

[05-Jun-19 04:56 AM] SHossain#0007
then, use the desktop lite version to send funds out

[05-Jun-19 04:56 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain but it shows no transactions for that address

[05-Jun-19 04:57 AM] n64#7103
@SHossain both electrum servers are down, unable to use lite mode

[05-Jun-19 04:57 AM] PTYX#6840
@SVET5 it depends on the kmd team, magnum is willing to add other assets. They already added us and gave us ledger capability

[05-Jun-19 04:57 AM] TSW#6522
@SHossain it will not let me

[05-Jun-19 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
@TSW you don't see tx in desktop or webwallet?

[05-Jun-19 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
@n64 please check my post again and use VRSC Lite mode, not KMD lite mode

[05-Jun-19 04:58 AM] tolken#2655
@TSW I used Chameleon wallet successfully to move funds out
