Always here.
but I do not have access to my balance with the wallet Agama

@gcharang i'm wondering about an address generated 2 years ago. is the problem with recent wallets, or old wallets also?

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] flick#6039
@gcharang "Please select compatible wallet seed type", what to select???

@.🐳👻🍄. noob kraken .🐙🐠. if you used it in agama in the past four months you need to move them

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Entity you don’t have his private keys

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] .🐳👻🍄. noob kraken .🐙🐠.#3649
cool. thanks

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] .🐳👻🍄. noob kraken .🐙🐠.#3649
havent touched it 😛

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Entity do you have neo's seed?

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Having pub key doesn’t prove anything

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] CryptoHippy69#1033
@gcharang Please could you confirm if my KMD coins ended up in the safe adress my address is RPwuTM4yKwJoQGL8iHfAUY1inevfkmqxFK

[05-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Entity#5862
@Crabby Paddy Those were leaked, optained by someone

[05-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Entity#5862
Bad proof

[05-Jun-19 01:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
@CryptoHippy69 you can do this yourself <http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RPwuTM4yKwJoQGL8iHfAUY1inevfkmqxFK>

[05-Jun-19 01:08 PM] CryptoHippy69#1033
@mrlynch there were two transactions out of my wallet, they dont match the safe address thats why im asking

[05-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
No one has had any funds taken so far. Everyone who has funds taken out as of now has been to the safe address. 

It might take time but they are doing it by contact/dm, some sort of proof etc. they won’t just send funds out to anyone

[05-Jun-19 01:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@CryptoHippy69 yes thay are safe

[05-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Entity#5862
When seeds are going te get leaked over the internet. You guys are just going to pay the first come first serve? There is no way to proof you are the true owner of the address?

[05-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
They never said first come first serve, they never said no way to prove, and it hasn’t/most likely won’t be leaked to public

[05-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
The fact that no one has had funds stolen so far apart from safe address is already good. I personally applaud Komodo for reacting this quickly

@gcharang  Thank F#$K. In the claim form, can I use for instance a Binance address to receive funds back

[05-Jun-19 01:12 PM] gcharang#6833
I won't recommend using the binance address as claim address
if there were problems in the txn we send out, then you will have to deal with us and binance support team
just create a new seed in verus agama and you should be fine @CryptoHippy69

[05-Jun-19 01:12 PM] PD#1377
This is interesting; explorer is showing about 2/3 of my KMD transferred.  Where the other 1/3 go?

[05-Jun-19 01:12 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
I sent mine to Binance

[05-Jun-19 01:13 PM] gcharang#6833
@PD can you dm the address?

Anyone can see all pubkeys, it won’t matter

[05-Jun-19 01:17 PM] PD#1377

Binance is ok yes?

[05-Jun-19 01:18 PM] PD#1377
Also there is a (S) next to the 2/3 amount.  Other transactions have a (U) next to it.  Anyone know what those letters mean?

[05-Jun-19 01:19 PM] flick#6039
Cannot create an address in VersusCoin Agama 😦

[05-Jun-19 01:19 PM] general_grievous#6992
Will there be an agama update ?

[05-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Bob Sandvich#9974
Thanks @Crabby Paddy . It seems that my KMD is all moved, so I'll fill out the form. However, I have another problem. All my assets are still there, and they're non negligible amounts. Should I send some KMD to it from somewhere else and then send them out? Or is there something in place that sends my KMD out of my wallet now

[05-Jun-19 01:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@PD thats a small j at the end

[05-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Quarterback#7090
do we have to put our old KMD Address in the "missing Form" or the Address where the Coins are transfered to?

[05-Jun-19 01:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
old address

[05-Jun-19 01:22 PM] PD#1377
@gcharang not at end of my address.  Just a (S) in parenthesis next to the KMD amount🤷🏻‍♂️

[05-Jun-19 01:22 PM] bouch#7580
Are BEER, NINJA, PGT, PIZZA assets worth moving? Was only going to move JUMBLR and ZILLA?

[05-Jun-19 01:22 PM] blubbi#0643
beer, ninja, pizza  no

[05-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Bob Sandvich don’t need kmd for fees or anything to send assets out

[05-Jun-19 01:22 PM] blubbi#0643
worthless

[05-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Bob Sandvich#9974
Oh thanks. Sorry, must've missed that

[05-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Test coins

[05-Jun-19 01:23 PM] blubbi#0643
PGT is something worth

Can Ledger KMD address handle assets like JUMBLR and ZILLA?

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
@gcharang i think he's referring to (U) (S) - unspent, spent?!

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] PD#1377
Ok got it thanks...typo

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@bouch you’d have to get priv key off ledger

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’d say use agama verus

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] PD#1377
@mrlynch  yes thank u

[05-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
To send assetchain to

[05-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Easier to get priv key off it for importing into new wallet in near future

[05-Jun-19 01:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Crabby Paddy is Out / Zex coins safe

[05-Jun-19 01:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
What Happen Just woke up

[05-Jun-19 01:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you used them in agama no

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Only recieved them

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not send

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Any

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] blubbi#0643
@mrtzmp3 nothing is safe if u used agama

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
@mrtzmp3 please read <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you imported seed/wif in agama this year consider said seed/wif compromised

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@mrlynch double checking, kmd cli is okay

[05-Jun-19 01:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Crabby Paddy fresh install? did you import wif from cli to agama?

[05-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yeah like server made to stake coins

[05-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Never imported

[05-Jun-19 01:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
if agama hasn't touched the wifs from your cli wallet you're safe

[05-Jun-19 01:27 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@mrlynch thx sir

[05-Jun-19 01:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
@mrtzmp3 please be aware that KMD Security Team has sweeped the funds from vuln addresses so if you see that your funds were sent somewhere, follow the trail to final destination and compare with safe addresses - if funds are there you're safe and you'll need to fill in the claim form

[05-Jun-19 01:29 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Got you

[05-Jun-19 01:29 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
Mine were there sent to Binance but was probably fine in Agama

[05-Jun-19 01:29 PM] alexander#4618
Just in case.. is it still possible to claim interest before moving funds to another wallet? I use Agama (wallet was created about 2 years ago) in lite mode, funds are still in there (can see it in explorer) but agama can't connect to server.

[05-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@alexander no issues with claiming

[05-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Sending to another would auto claim anyway

[05-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And send back to the original address, then you can send the remaining reward over

[05-Jun-19 01:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
@alexander you will have to use something else to send funds .. please read <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

[05-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Webwallet or qt

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] .🐳👻🍄. noob kraken .🐙🐠.#3649
@alexander i'm in similar position. but the word is it could be an issue if you used agama this year for anything /

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] alen#3721
@mrlynch i am sorry..im no expert in any kind of software, what does that mean? If the wallet hasnt touched cli wallet

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Alan was referring to using vps staking, shouldn’t matter to you

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] .🐳👻🍄. noob kraken .🐙🐠.#3649
oh that doesnt help

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] alen#3721
Ok thanks

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Kmd cli is fine, as long as stakers didn’t import private keys back onto agama

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
if wifs for addresses generated in cli wallet were imported in agama consider them compromised

[05-Jun-19 01:31 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Last night it was only if you used lite mode and used your seed in the last 4 months. Not it’s any uses if agama this year

[05-Jun-19 01:32 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
This is ridiculous. I kept my funds in my address because I use native only but now that supposedly is compromised too

[05-Jun-19 01:32 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Based off what I was told here last night

[05-Jun-19 01:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ResoluteCrypto better to be safe than sorry
