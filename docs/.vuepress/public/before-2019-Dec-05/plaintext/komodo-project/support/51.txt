Cheers

[05-Nov-18 05:45 PM] TorJado#3802
If I do a new claim, would that result in a third UTXO, and so I should claim before merging?

[05-Nov-18 05:47 PM] gcharang#6833
Yes. thats for the best. When ever you have more than one, its best to merge if your utxo is less than 10 but the new reward utxo will always be created if there was a reward to claim. So don't merge if it is too small

Try again downloading Bdex there was an update after the release you have. release candidate 1

[08-Nov-18 02:52 AM] Hermes#6934
I have not tested this coin,  have you managed to use it before in Bdex?

[08-Nov-18 02:53 AM] nikizan#4052
I dowload BarterDEX 2 day ago.. thanx, try do download last release.

[08-Nov-18 02:55 AM] nikizan#4052
may be I must place aywa.conf file in special folder? C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Roaming\aywacoin\aywa.conf for example?

[08-Nov-18 02:55 AM] nikizan#4052
now conf in D : \ _mine\COINS\AywaCore_win64\DATA\aywa.conf

[08-Nov-18 02:55 AM] Hermes#6934
Could also have something to do with the .conf file ...when was the last time you used it in Bdex?

[08-Nov-18 02:55 AM] Hermes#6934
yes Bdex will read the data from the the %appdata% directory.

[08-Nov-18 02:56 AM] nikizan#4052
no, BarterDEX never used before.. first try)

[08-Nov-18 02:56 AM] Hermes#6934
that's the default for most native wallet clients

[08-Nov-18 03:02 AM] nikizan#4052
hm.. I was install last release yet.. in logs BarterDEX show this:

[08-Nov-18 03:02 AM] nikizan#4052
{ Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Users\MyUser\AppData\Roaming\BarterDEX\CoinsDB\electrums\AYWA'
  errno: -4058,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
  path: 'C:\\Users\\MyUser\\AppData\\Roaming\\BarterDEX\\CoinsDB\\electrums\\AYWA' }

[08-Nov-18 03:02 AM] nikizan#4052
but added as Native, not Electrum...

[08-Nov-18 03:05 AM] Hermes#6934
this log was after you switched the AYWA folder into %appdata%Roaming?

[08-Nov-18 03:05 AM] nikizan#4052
5 sec.. check this again (remove from appdata and start for test)

[08-Nov-18 03:06 AM] Hermes#6934
ok when you do restart barterdex

[08-Nov-18 03:09 AM] nikizan#4052
report: exit BDEX, rename .aywacore to .aywacore0 (in %appdata%), start again.. error with "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open " still apears.. üò¶ may be I need manualy change in some config a type of AYWA to Native?

[08-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Hermes#6934
Haven't used this coin but if the RPC settings are correct Barterdex should be able to load the the wallet with no issues.

[08-Nov-18 03:14 AM] Hermes#6934
Please send us a ticket with the error that you are seeing right now at support@komodoplatform.com ,  sometimes the dev teams need to make some updates to their wallets , haven't triend AYWA but we will review this shortly.

[08-Nov-18 03:15 AM] Hermes#6934
By having the AYWA folder in the %appdata% directory Barterdex should be able to read it ...sometimes I have experienced that I need to select the adding a couple of times because the wallet lags while synced.

[08-Nov-18 03:15 AM] Hermes#6934
But if your wallet is 100% synced and online you should be able to run it on native...if the RPC settings are correct.

@nikizan  Yesterday I downloaded the windows version of the Aywa wallet and also tried using Barterdex in native but still didn‚Äôt work in a fresh installation. My guess is that the RPC settings in the wallet are not properly configured for Bdex.

[08-Nov-18 06:31 PM] crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang#6019
Where can I find info on setting up Pirate on my pool?  I already have kmd up.

[08-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Hermes#6934
Here  is a link that can help you in doing this processs https://github.com/webworker01/knomp , it's from our ecosystem . Please in this case read the full README and also it needs some knowledge on redis and node.js  @crypto_mang - pool.cryptomang Hope it helps...

[09-Nov-18 12:21 AM] cipi#4502
@nikizan could be you are experiencing this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/issues/128
AYWA has the default datadir/conf-file in an unusual location... `~/.aywacore/aywa.conf`instead of `~/.aywa/aywa.conf`, so the coins database entry for AWYA contains the additional parameter "conffile": https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L78
BarterDEX needs to be able to find and open the coins config file
Look after this config file and check if it contains at least this entries
```server=1
rpcuser=whatever
rpcpassword=whatever```

I need a reccomendation, I am mining Pirate coin on Nvidia rigs with no issue. I have a RX580 AMD rig I want to use, I have tried lolMiner and had no luck, I found on their GitHub they do not support it yet. Is there an AMD miner that will mine Pirate Coin?
