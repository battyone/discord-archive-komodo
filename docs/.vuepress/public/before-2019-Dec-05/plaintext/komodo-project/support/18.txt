OK, thanks for the update.  Have to check with mynode.rocks what is holding up my DNR deposit as well.

[26-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Nabob#5004
address validation you can check on your daemon using  this
`bitcore-cli validateaddress <your address> `

[26-Jul-18 04:40 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I figured it may be a problem on their end, why I asked here instead of opening a support ticket.

[26-Jul-18 04:42 AM] agnewpickens#7393
will do, have to go back to Cryptopia and open a support ticket so you can follow it first.

[26-Jul-18 04:43 AM] agnewpickens#7393
You'll want my ticket # from there in the report since problem is on their end, right?

[26-Jul-18 04:45 AM] Nabob#5004
Please raise support Ticket to us, we wil follow from there, we verified their code, seems they recently had some code changes

[26-Jul-18 04:56 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Sent you a support ticket request along with the Cryptopia ticket # I opened.

[26-Jul-18 04:57 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I included my BTX deposit address in my ticket with them so they could have a look on their end.

[26-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Nabob#5004
We found BTX Code changes done recently, which is seriously un-necessary.  they have provided 3 Months time frame

Will worry about the mynode.rocks DNR withdrawal hang up issue tomorrow.

[26-Jul-18 05:04 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Thanks Nabob, getting late here and early day coming for me.

[26-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Nabob#5004
Regarding DNR, Please consult this with DNR community, Let us know if you need any more help

[26-Jul-18 05:06 AM] agnewpickens#7393
This is a new account I created that is for swaps so I can leave my main account collecting interest, had no issues with Dash or Mona deposits.

[26-Jul-18 05:07 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I think this is a mynode.rocks issue, I have had succesful DNR deposits on my other account recently, have a DNR MN share at that website

[26-Jul-18 05:08 AM] agnewpickens#7393
But they hang out in DNR Discord, the mynode.rocks people, so will report there first like I did here.

[26-Jul-18 05:09 AM] agnewpickens#7393
But tomorrow, dozing off at KB here.

Hello all

[26-Jul-18 11:23 AM] petar#9170
Hello. I am have used agama wallet since december 2017. I have some amount of Komodo in it. I had to reinstall it, but when i log in with seed balance shows 0 KMD and different public address. I didn't backup my private key only seed.

[26-Jul-18 11:23 AM] petar#9170

[26-Jul-18 11:46 AM] Nabob#5004
@petar  Earlier, you are which agama version and Let us know which mode  ?

[26-Jul-18 11:47 AM] zatJUM#9924
Hi. I just installed komodod and downloaded zcash-params, but komodod says "This version will be deprecated at block height 1009664, and will automatically shut down. You should upgrade to the latest version of Zcash.". Is it just a warning, or komodod has to be updated before that block?

[26-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Nabob#5004
If you all the while used seed to Login Agama lite Mode, you have Make sure of  your seed which has any trailing spaces  or typos

[26-Jul-18 11:47 AM] petar#9170
i uninstaled it so i cant remember earlier version, now i use latest version `Version 0.2.41-beta`

[26-Jul-18 11:47 AM] petar#9170

[26-Jul-18 01:25 PM] ranfoltu#0306
I tried entering in my Wallet Seed / WIF that is used when logging into the wallet, but I get "Get UTXO error" with this.

[26-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Hermes#6934
Which version of Agama you currently have ? @ranfoltu

[26-Jul-18 02:04 PM] ranfoltu#0306
@Hermes v0.2.41-beta

[26-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok , for now I will recommend trying to split the UTXOs , using the inventory option of Barterdex . Or if you are going to trade in the Hyperdex it will handle the trade and the splitting in an easier way.

Question from a Telegram User:

45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.

However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?

[26-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Hermes#6934
I think we can point it to #dev-scalability

[26-Jul-18 07:32 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Cryptopia reporting a resolution to my support ticket for withdrawing BTX to Barter DEX address.

[26-Jul-18 07:34 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Now to find out why my DNR withdrawal from mynode.rocks hasn't arrived yet.  Fun fun fun!

[26-Jul-18 07:36 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Looks like the withdrawal just failed from their end, because balance has returned to my wallet there.

[26-Jul-18 07:38 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Yerp, got cancelled on their end.  thanks for the help last night @Nabob

[27-Jul-18 04:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes 

I"m trying to get Agama to work on Linux, and for some reason it's not working. 

The software launches okay, but the blockchain won't sync. 

I get the message, "Unable to establish RPC connection!"

[27-Jul-18 04:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've tried clearing out the data in the KMD folder and even the wallet.dat file.

[27-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, I've rebooted Agama a few times, and the machine.

[27-Jul-18 04:51 AM] Hermes#6934
Hi there , you are on version 2.41 right Linux 16.04?

[27-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Hermes#6934
You backed up your wallet.dat file ?

[27-Jul-18 04:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm on Linux 18.04 and I haven't used this wallet.dat file yet

[27-Jul-18 04:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let me check agama version

[27-Jul-18 04:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's a brand new download, so it should be fine.

[27-Jul-18 04:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, 0.2.41

[27-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Hermes#6934
Hmm yeah I have being seeing some issues with 18.04 if you are on the portable version try moving the Agama folder to the SRC folder located in the root main folder

[27-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the whole folder, correct?

[27-Jul-18 04:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[27-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes

[27-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not seeing a src folder... hmmm..

[27-Jul-18 05:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I see ./snap ./srv and ./sys

[27-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Hermes#6934
On 16.04 to get access to the root I use the command gksudo nautilus to access the Computer main folder

[27-Jul-18 05:04 AM] Hermes#6934
Src is located on USR folder

[27-Jul-18 05:05 AM] Hermes#6934
For it being the portable version is recommended to be located in the SRC folder

[27-Jul-18 05:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
USR, k let me look

[27-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, there it is ..

[27-Jul-18 05:07 AM] Hermes#6934
I am trying to think what else can be causing the RPC connection issue it could be a corrupted file download

[27-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, I've moved it into /usr/src

[27-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let's see if it works... so far no sign

[27-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The Zcash params downloaded fine.

[27-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Wonder why this isn't working...

[27-Jul-18 05:11 AM] Hermes#6934
You erased all of the Komodo folder ?

[27-Jul-18 05:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Earlier, yes.

[27-Jul-18 05:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did it through the settings.

[27-Jul-18 05:13 AM] Hermes#6934
Try doing it manually you will need to locate the Komodo folder and verify if the chainstate and block folders are there . Try erasing them and that should trigger the resync from scratch

[27-Jul-18 05:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Where are they located?

[27-Jul-18 05:14 AM] Hermes#6934
Open the terminal and try looking for it here

[27-Jul-18 05:14 AM] Hermes#6934
Linux: ~/.komodo

[27-Jul-18 05:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Not seeing anything

[27-Jul-18 05:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
searching still

[27-Jul-18 05:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
there's something...

[27-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've got ./komodo-cli and ./komodod installed in ./usr/src/Agama-linux-x64/resources/app/assets/bin/linux64

[27-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no blockchain state, though, just an index.html file

[27-Jul-18 05:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what should I be looking for?

[27-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Getting back to you in a few minutes getting back home

[27-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Do you see the Komodo folder by going to file explorer ?

[27-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I haven't found any komodo folder

[27-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
searching again

[27-Jul-18 05:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no folders found

[27-Jul-18 05:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
just the files I mentioned above

[27-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can see the files on one computer (linux), but this is the computer that isn't having an issue.

[27-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
On the computer that's having the issue, there's nothing there.

[27-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
On the computer that works. the files are in ~/komodo

[27-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, nevermind. Found it. They were just hidden.

[27-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In the ~/komodo folder there's just a komodo.conf file, nothing else

[27-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Hermes#6934
Erase the Komodo.conf file and resync from scratch

[27-Jul-18 06:04 AM] Hermes#6934
That should solve the issue unless you have maybe a firewall or a process that can be stopping komodod

[27-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Alright, we'll give it a few minutes and see if it works this time...

Says loading data please wait

[27-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Nope, no dice...

[27-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I suppose I could just delete everything and start from scratch.

[27-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I wonder if the zcash params were corrupted on download

[27-Jul-18 06:11 AM] Hermes#6934
Very strange @Nabob  any ideas ?
