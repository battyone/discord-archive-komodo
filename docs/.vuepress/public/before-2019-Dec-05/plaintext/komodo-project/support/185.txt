My Ledger is working properly on Ledger Live, but not with this tool. Anyone else the same problems? Or a solution maybe?

[09-Nov-19 12:12 PM] CHMEX#0686

Can not deposit KMD on Binance or on Bitvavo. Any reasons why?

[09-Nov-19 08:22 PM] Oszy#5734
They have to complete the network upgrade.

[09-Nov-19 08:22 PM] revaen#6538
Okay thanks for the super quick reply

[10-Nov-19 11:34 AM] criptobear#6402
to receive the rev shares holding DEX is ok to hold them in chameleon or they need to be held in agama?

[10-Nov-19 11:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@criptobear they will be airdropped to the same DEX address on the Komodo blockchain
so, if you have access to the same komodo address as your dex address, you will receive it

[10-Nov-19 11:35 AM] criptobear#6402
thx

[10-Nov-19 11:38 AM] criptobear#6402
is there any kind of stable coin on komodo platform with a defi on top of it, sort of like compound on ethereum?

[10-Nov-19 11:42 AM] gcharang#6833
#cc-pegs  is to create a stable coin (in development)

[10-Nov-19 11:47 AM] criptobear#6402
and DEFI? i think it is very good thing for people like me that for example want to put some fiat money from the bank in something that would give some earning (reasonably low) percentage but with zero or very low risk, like banks where doing some year ago, for holding a stable coin. Buying any coin or token is very risky, i saw the value of my investments in crypto going to near zero in 2 years as i think almost everybody experienced.

[10-Nov-19 11:51 AM] criptobear#6402
just realized i am asking in support channel, sorry

[10-Nov-19 11:51 AM] gcharang#6833
once the cc-pegs is well tested and the stable coin works as expected, DEFI applications are the next target
either as Antara modules themselves or as instances of FSM module that is currently under development
FSM cc enables near turing complete on-chain smart contract creation

[10-Nov-19 11:52 AM] gcharang#6833
no problem 🙂

how is it possible??? please help

[10-Nov-19 04:49 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
which version did you download?

[10-Nov-19 04:49 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
did you use a previously used address?if so when was it generated?

[10-Nov-19 04:50 PM] fila#1264
0.5.9-2

[10-Nov-19 04:50 PM] fila#1264
yes i did

[10-Nov-19 04:50 PM] fila#1264
i used my old address

[10-Nov-19 04:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you old address was probably compromised

[10-Nov-19 04:51 PM] fila#1264
no

[10-Nov-19 04:51 PM] fila#1264
noo

[10-Nov-19 04:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
when did you generate the old address?

[10-Nov-19 04:51 PM] fila#1264
a year ago

[10-Nov-19 04:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and before using 0.5.9-2 have you used other version?

[10-Nov-19 04:52 PM] fila#1264
yes an beta 0.3.2 or something

[10-Nov-19 04:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I believe that version was compromised, so any address created or accessed using that version will be compromised

[10-Nov-19 04:54 PM] fila#1264
im gonna kill myself because a lot of money for me

[10-Nov-19 04:55 PM] fila#1264
can we track the thief and restore the transaction?

[10-Nov-19 04:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
how many kmd was lost?

[10-Nov-19 04:55 PM] fila#1264
about 1100

followed the transfers. It's still being transfered to new addresses. Right now it's heading to https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/REvqqintzZ8UPSdKcRnrvdntUsJ7gwD1ZP

[10-Nov-19 08:12 PM] fila#1264
thanks for your time. Agama wallet shouldn’t allow me to use any compromised address 😦 I maybe missed the hack announcement on Twitter but there wasn’t any warning in the new wallet version to better change my address 😞

[11-Nov-19 02:23 AM] Dyeles#8347
Hello guys, reading all this brings memories of that episode and how well it was handled by the team, unfortunately it seems that not everybody got to be connected or aware of the hack. Recently one of my Japanese buddies I introduced to Komodo back during the ICO returned from Japan and is asking if you guys are in control of this address: RBkXoXwwhBTRvKDqMbzAyKqChGdW1X3kqZ. My KMD's where sent to safety address back then, and all got returned to me thanks to SHossain  and JL but I can't recall this address as safe one. My friend returned, got his funds out of Bittrex and according to him, as SOON as they arrived into his compromised wallet, they were swapped to the mentioned address. Any feedback I can give him on that. Thanks!

[11-Nov-19 02:55 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Unfortunately all the compromised addresses have been scripted to auto transfer to the hacker address

[11-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Dyeles#8347
@Gordon Komodo , thanks, that's what I figured with my limited programing knowledge. I just needed to confirmed that was not an address controlled by the team. At least I can bring bad news and a reason. Cheers

[11-Nov-19 03:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I have suggested to verus wallet dev to maybe include a wallet notification to suggest user to create new address if their addresses have been created/used using compromised version of the wallet.

[11-Nov-19 03:08 AM] Dyeles#8347
I think the biggest problem is for those that are/were not aware of the hack at all, I haven't seen him in a LONG time. He just assumed everything was just fine, went to Bittrex, got his funds and then puff. Obviously he is not in discord or twitter and I completely forgot about him ( At that moment I was just worried about my own funds lol). It is what it is, he knew the risk and he will be fine about it, for what I can track it was only under 500KMD. Man, it will hurt when KMD reaches 20$. Thank you @Gordon Komodo , you gotta appreciate this community.

So hackers wrote script to automatically transfer funds from all compromised addresses, wow. Hard. A crypto hodlers’ night mare

[11-Nov-19 09:48 AM] fila#1264
I had bad dreams tonight. Komodo is my favourite project and I bought some everytime I could and now it’s gonne. Hard lesson 😬. Doesn’t Komodo have a bounty program for scammed fans? 😅

Hey guys, the AtomicDEX Android app goes full black after launch and a blank black screen is all I get.

[11-Nov-19 01:08 PM] coinspeed#8792
When launching, I see the small logo in the center for a second with a dark blue background and then it switches to the black screen.

[11-Nov-19 01:12 PM] Arno#3334
It had been suggested to uninstall and re-install the app again in that case.

Is it possible to to add an ERC20 token to the dex?

[11-Nov-19 01:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its possible, if projects want to list they can contact the team for listing fees

[11-Nov-19 01:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
some are already there

[11-Nov-19 01:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
DAI for exapmple

[11-Nov-19 01:44 PM] coinspeed#8792
Any idea what the listing fee is?

yes

[11-Nov-19 01:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
let me check

[11-Nov-19 01:47 PM] coinspeed#8792
It should be just adding a new record with logo, no new functionality needed. Standard ERC20 shittoken

[11-Nov-19 01:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
its free to add it to the 'DEX' its a PR to https://github.com/jl777/coins

[11-Nov-19 01:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is a cost to enable it on atomicdex which is the mobileapp

[11-Nov-19 02:00 PM] coinspeed#8792

[11-Nov-19 02:04 PM] blockchain_ocean#7152
If there are 2 or more UTXOs that are greater than 10 in 1 address, will the staking rewards be added up?

Hello. I'm using Agama wallet 0.5.9-2 from Veruscoin for KMD native mode. Every time I start wallet, sync of blocks is starting from around 1.45M block height. After full sync I close the wallet and when I open it again, it start syncing again from 1.45M block height. What could be a problem here? Windows 10, 64 bit.

[12-Nov-19 08:45 AM] gcharang#6833
