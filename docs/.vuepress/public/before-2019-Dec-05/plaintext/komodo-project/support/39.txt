Question 2. Can the portable version generate an address for pirate?

[24-Sep-18 04:04 PM] Hermes#6934
First question , did you run the sudo command inside the folder where the Installer file is ?

[24-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Hermes#6934
If it's in downloads you have to enter the folder downloads cd Downloads

[24-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Hermes#6934
and then run the command

[24-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Hermes#6934
Second Question , yes you can

[24-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Nabob#5004
`sudo apt-get install  libconf-2-4 libcurl3`

[24-Sep-18 04:10 PM] Nabob#5004
There is space between two dependencies

[24-Sep-18 04:13 PM] joe2x4#5987
I did the sudo command inside of the folder. I tried it in the download folder as well as desktop.

[24-Sep-18 04:14 PM] joe2x4#5987
I also tried to put the space in between the two dependencies.

[24-Sep-18 04:16 PM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe the issue has to do with it being the live version not the installed ubuntu. Since the portable version Did work for me. How do I generate a pirate address?

[24-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Nabob#5004
Goto Receive button > click on "Get New Address" -- select private Z - address

[24-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Nabob#5004
Note: make sure to take backup of private key as well

[24-Sep-18 04:50 PM] joe2x4#5987
Thanks. I'll try that when back at the house.

[25-Sep-18 01:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
trying to create a new asset chain, but haven't had any luck.

[25-Sep-18 01:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The nodes don't seem to be connecting for some reason

[25-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I do this on my first computer:

```
./komodod -ac_name=AAA -ac_supply=1000 -addnode=185.245.87.44 &
```

[25-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so that should get it started.

[25-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
then, on the second computer, I've entered this:

```
./komodod -ac_name=AAA -ac_supply=1000 -addnode=(myip) -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)
```

[25-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In both cases, I'll get the same `magic` value, the same port, etc.

The second node will also start attempting to mine.

[25-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
However, the mining never realizes.

[25-Sep-18 01:39 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I went to the first node and entered:

```
komodo-cli setgenerate true
```

and got a positive response.

No balance came, still.

So I tried:

```
komodo-cli getaddednodeinfo true
```
And got a response showing that the nodes aren't connected.

```
[
  {
    "addednode": "185.245.87.44",
    "connected": false,
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address": "185.245.87.44:10970",
        "connected": "false"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

[25-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm using a VPN on the second node, so that I can get separate ip addresses for each. My experience with networks is limited, so I'm guessing this is a p2p networking issue in the way I have things set up, but I don't know for sure.

[25-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Help is appreciated. Thank you.

[25-Sep-18 01:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Example:
computer 1 IP: 185.245.87.44
computer 2 IP: 185.245.87.45

computer 1: `./komodod -ac_name=AAA -ac_supply=1000 -addnode=185.245.87.45 -daemon`

computer2: `./komodod -ac_name=AAA -ac_supply=1000 -addnode=185.245.87.44 -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc) -daemon`

[25-Sep-18 01:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```-addnode=(myip)
-addnode=185.245.87.44 &```

[25-Sep-18 01:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
instead of variable, try with value first... helps with troubleshooting

[25-Sep-18 01:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
test and check if ports are open to each other.

[25-Sep-18 01:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can't think of any other reason these not working ü§î

[25-Sep-18 01:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mylo

[25-Sep-18 01:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess you are just doing this as a test, so I'd suggest you use virtual machines

[25-Sep-18 01:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do testing between my mac and VM machine üôÇ

[25-Sep-18 01:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no need of vpn and stuff

[25-Sep-18 01:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
use local ip address ranges of your vm and host IPs

[25-Sep-18 01:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for your test a 2 GB to 4 GB RAM VM will be more than enough

[25-Sep-18 01:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
set it up with 2 threads cpu

[25-Sep-18 03:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, that's right. Mylo just got one set up for me. I'll give that a try next, thanks, Satinder!

[25-Sep-18 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
damn it... not sure how I tagged Mylo and not you @Bryan_Beus üòõ

[25-Sep-18 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sorry üòÑ

[25-Sep-18 04:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no worries, it's a compliment. 

and mylo did just set one up for me this last weekend.

[25-Sep-18 09:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Cool, make a record of your problems @Bryan_Beus because you won't have been the first (i can guarantee you that!) and you won't be the last.
The first time i made an AC, i ran into the same problems - and the problem was me.   I had an expectation that something would happen and it did, it just didn't happen the way i had expected it to.
IIRC you have to mine a block and the supply is on the node you don't expect ;)

Other things to note are basic networking troubleshooting like ping, traceroute, telnet to the port from both local and remote machines, check fw rules if any and look at the ~/.komodo/AC_NAME/debug.log for any hints.   <---- this is an often overlooked step, even by experts üòâ

[25-Sep-18 09:09 AM] Mylo#8306

Still trying to get this test asset chain to work. 

Not sure if it's related, but all my asset chains on my desktop will not load now. They crash with this:

```
Warning: Warning: error reading wallet.dat! All keys read correctly, but transaction data or address book entries might be missing or incorrect.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  CWallet::GetCredit(): value out of range

[25-Sep-18 10:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Tried clearing all deleting all block data and swapping out the wallet.dat file, but no luck.

[25-Sep-18 10:16 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I‚Äôm right there lol, but it won‚Äôt let me connect

[25-Sep-18 10:19 PM] Hermes#6934
You are using the CLI right @Bryan_Beus?

[25-Sep-18 10:20 PM] Hermes#6934
Haven't seen this error before

[25-Sep-18 10:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@DR3WSKi ask in #talk-mining @webworker01 or others can help

[25-Sep-18 10:21 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Thx

[25-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes Yes, using cli.

It's affecting all of the asset chains I've synced, including asset chains like BOTS and SUPERNET.

[25-Sep-18 10:45 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@Bryan_Beus if it's happening on all chains its probably something with your komodo binary

[25-Sep-18 10:45 PM] xRobeSx#5136
maybe update and rebuild?

[25-Sep-18 10:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, I need to do that.

[25-Sep-18 10:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
These are the instructions for installing and building from src, correct?

```
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/testing/test-komodo-source-jl777-branch.html
```

[25-Sep-18 11:00 PM] SHossain#0007
that would work too. just change branch from jl777 to any branch you want

[25-Sep-18 11:00 PM] SHossain#0007
the original instructions are here https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

[26-Sep-18 12:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
out of curiosity, when I do this command:

```
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

is that automatically activating my GPU, or is it CPU only?

Is there a way to get the build to use my GPU?

[26-Sep-18 12:51 AM] Hermes#6934
that should take threads of the CPU

[26-Sep-18 01:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In setting up an asset chain, do I need to indicate a port something that will forward past my router to my computers? they're all wireless.

Trying to figure out how to get my computers to just do a ping to each other.

[26-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Hermes#6934
If I remember correctly the second node should be pointed to the IPV4 of the first node that was created to launch the coin

[26-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't get a response even when I do:

```
ping (ip of node one or two)
```

[26-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, I think this is something about my local network, maybe.

[26-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Hermes#6934
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP address of the second node> &

[26-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
This has to be set up in the first node and then this on the second one

[26-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP address of the first node> -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)

[26-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
But what I am not sure if it's in the same network you will have the same public IP in both PCs

[26-Sep-18 01:22 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@Bryan_Beus once you start an assetchain and do ‚Äògetinfo‚Äô it will show the p2p port it‚Äôs on

[26-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
ü§î

[26-Sep-18 01:23 AM] xRobeSx#5136
If on the same network you can connect or addnode with your local ipaddress

[26-Sep-18 01:23 AM] xRobeSx#5136
addnode=192.168.2.1xx

[26-Sep-18 01:24 AM] Hermes#6934
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html , @xRobeSx  thanks for the clarification ..on that ...just in case Siddhartha this is the guide that I am using

[26-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, @Hermes, I'm trying to rewrite that guide, and I'm not able to connect.

@xRobeSx 

Is there something I can do on my local machines to discover how they're connecting through the router? Shouldn't there be some forwarding?

I have each node set to go through a separate router, and each one has a separate IP address. No VPN.

But if I just do `ping <either ip address>` on either machine, I don't get any response. That means I must be doing something wrong with the way I'm communicating on the network. Machine are (obviously) connected to the Internet find.

[26-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
fine

[26-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, getinfo

[26-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, let's try that..

[26-Sep-18 01:52 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Tried a few different things. I've actually already tried putting `ipaddress:port` together, but it still isn't working, even after updating to src.

[26-Sep-18 02:18 AM] Nabob#5004
Small correction :

```First run non mining chain with no gen param

cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP address of the mining node> &
Then, on mining node, run with below params
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000  -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)```

This way, Its working fine, Tested just now

[26-Sep-18 02:18 AM] Nabob#5004
@Bryan_Beus

[26-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus if the node is behind a router, you have to port forward the p2p port

[26-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

I've tried using the p2p port that I get from the `.conf` file.

[26-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is there something else?

[26-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Alright#0419
This p2p port must not be blocked by a firewall. If the computers do not have public IP addresses, you will need to port-forward the p2p port on both computers and append the forwarded port to the IP. For example:

./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=<IP of the second node>:8096

[26-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've done this.

[26-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
At least, in as much as I can tell...

[26-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but no idea what.

[26-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
when I do `getinfo` on both machines, I get `p2pport: 10970`

[26-Sep-18 11:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've tried appending the port to both chains on launch, but still I'm not getting a positive connection.
