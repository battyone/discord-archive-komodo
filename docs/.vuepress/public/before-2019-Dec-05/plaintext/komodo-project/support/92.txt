Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Start the Agama you have been using (0.3.5 or 0.3.6b) then login using your old seed to send funds to the new address you created 
3. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.

2. Start the Agama you have been using (0.3.5 or 0.3.6b) then login using your old seed to send funds to the new address you created  - ya that part doesn't work that well

[05-Jun-19 02:46 AM] zaius333#5338
Using the offline signing tool..... can I use that to send to binance or does it have to be another wallet?

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] SHossain#0007
@Dave123 use VRSC coin to create a new wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] SHossain#0007
@zaius333 you can use that to send to any address

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] SHossain#0007
including binance for KMD

[05-Jun-19 02:47 AM] zaius333#5338
Ok

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
@SHossain i did this and it says to switch to a different server

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] CryptoFungus#5816
problem is can't access old wallet still, step 2 still leaves us stuck

[05-Jun-19 02:48 AM] SHossain#0007 (pinned)
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2. You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

this is how you send funds out 
If you are using Agama version 0.3.4 and can't sent funds out, use this guide. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
web wallet worked great !

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] SHossain#0007
Agama 5.6a to create new address and webwallet to send out funds

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] SHossain#0007
same address for KMD, VRSC and all other komodo assetchains

[05-Jun-19 02:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ehm... what the issue is? can someone explain?

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
i just used my seed to log in - send to - nano s address and thats it.

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
Even Verus-Agama 0.5.6 is not safe to send funds out?

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] gixxerfrog#3622
we couldnt get our old seed unstuck - we were on an older wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it seems like electrum servers are working great... old releases wont work because of the electrumx method change, only latest release will work.

[05-Jun-19 02:55 AM] mrlynch#5735 (pinned)
use this <https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php> to check for other assetchain funds

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
It does not sound like an issue with Agama wallet itself... it sounds like an issue with SEED created wallets on LITE SPV version

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why is verus wallet and webwallets being recommended?

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] zaius333#5338
Web wallet works like a charm

[05-Jun-19 02:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Best prctice would be to use native mode

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
Seeds that shared info with the SPV servers would be the scope of what we have been told

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] DLT Novice#2835
Is it the komodoplatform webs ite got a hacked wallet? Why versus? Why not add the new wallet to komodo website

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] bishop#9773
@siu - Chainmakers Did you login with your wif in Agama lite?

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Dave123#3592
@SHossain  thanks it work with the webwallet

[05-Jun-19 02:57 AM] SHossain#0007
@daemonfox you need to send funds out to new address anyhow

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but if its spv communication then its not agama....

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if it is spv communication then is any of the methods compromised?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] daemonfox#6136
OK... so even manually generated key pairs in Agama are at risk?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
electrumx deprecated a method not long ago..

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and if the issue is SPV why is web wallet and verus wallet being recommended?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 AM] SHossain#0007
