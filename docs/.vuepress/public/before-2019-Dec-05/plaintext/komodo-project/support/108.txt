So which walley i should use now?

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
there is still an investigation ongoing to try and ascertain the full extent of this vuln

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Sherdogz make an address with verus wallet and save priv and pub key

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
until that is concluded ... better safe than sorry

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just use that to store funds for now

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then import priv key into new wallet once it‚Äôs released

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
I wasn‚Äôt going to move funds and risk exposing myself to the vulnerability, but now I‚Äôm vulnerable anyway

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Can‚Äôt get home for another 12 hours

[05-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Thanks does versus wallet have  a mobile version?

[05-Jun-19 01:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ResoluteCrypto if your address was compromised there is a 90% chance it was sweeped and saved by KMD Sec Team

[05-Jun-19 01:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
check your address in the explorer - if funds are gone and ended up in sweep address (final destination) you're safe; if funds are still in your address you're safe, but it's recommended to move them as soon as you can

[05-Jun-19 01:35 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
That‚Äôs the problem I can‚Äôt check my address as I don‚Äôt have it memorized or saved anywhere at work.

[05-Jun-19 01:36 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
How do you know if your Agama wallet is safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@StrikerBurns presume it‚Äôs not and send funds to safe address

[05-Jun-19 01:37 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
Binance?

[05-Jun-19 01:37 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Is there a safe mobile wallet so i can move my funds immediately?

[05-Jun-19 01:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yes though I‚Äôd never trust an exchange with too much

[05-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ResoluteCrypto

[05-Jun-19 01:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you know your amount you can check the dexstats richlist

[05-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
From there it has a link to the KMD explorer

[05-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You can check if they moved

[05-Jun-19 01:42 PM] habship#2279
Do we need to do anything if we ran Agama in native mode? Aka we have a wallet.dat file. Or are our funds also at risk?

[05-Jun-19 01:42 PM] CHMEX#0686

[05-Jun-19 01:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
My wallet was swept to the community safe address

[05-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Seko#7408
The question has certainly been asked several times, sorry. But how will the users be able to verify themselves to get the funds back? Discord name, address and TX-ID? But that alone can't be enough?

[05-Jun-19 01:43 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Crabby Paddy to clarify  should i make a new address and then it's safe to import it in Agama or Should you use an other wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:44 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
@Hollowman9000 thanks. My funds are still in my native wallet. Hopefully they will still be there when I get home so I can move to a new address

[05-Jun-19 01:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
So, I got an R address, that I generated from a paper wallet generator. Even that is compromised If I moved/claimed funds in Agama within the last 4 months?

[05-Jun-19 01:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@bpkdasbaum if you imported that address in agama yes

[05-Jun-19 01:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
ouch

[05-Jun-19 01:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Does my PC have to be compromised for it too?

[05-Jun-19 01:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
No wait, then KMD team wouldn't be able top sweep the funds.

[05-Jun-19 01:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I don't understand how agama wallet can forward the seed information somewhere.

[05-Jun-19 01:50 PM] habship#2279
If I have a wallet.dat from agama can I read it in the KomodoOceanQT wallet?

[05-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Keppie#5156
@Seko  wondering the same thing

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Seko#7408
Maybe we get an answer in another channel...;)

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Seko conflicting claims are subject to secondary verification. Cant go in to details, as that would not be ideal in terms of security

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] technofloof#8761
so does this mean that the private keys were exposed ?

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Further information will be made available once safe to do so

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] cryptopoli#6868
Meanwhile I've generated a new wallet address in Agama V-0.3.6 and tested it several times, now I'm waiting for my secured KMD back, filled out the form "Agama 5th June Missing Funds Claim" and sent it off, so far no reaction here in the Discord not even by email as promised by the support???

[05-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Seko#7408
Thx @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[05-Jun-19 01:52 PM] technofloof#8761
@Deleted User  merci

[05-Jun-19 01:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@cryptopoli thanks for submitting form, we are working as fast as possible. If your funds made it to safety addressm they will be processed in due time

[05-Jun-19 01:54 PM] John the Cashist#7046
Any idea when the funds will be returned for those that are safe?

[05-Jun-19 01:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

maybe you can give a tentative timeline for when that can happen?
just so that people who see their funds safu in the sweep address to not need to stay glued to this discord out of FOMO until it does happen?

[05-Jun-19 01:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
as soon as possible

lol... the other type of FOMO

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
most of the team has not had a chance to check their own wallets yet either, as we are working on this as a priority

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I am confused. When downloading Verus Wallet. I get the file: Agama-win32-x64-v0.5.6a.zip Isn't that the same wallet then Verus= Agamaga? Is it a rebrand? I thought Agama was compromised ^^? I used Agama_windows_installer_0.3.1d before.

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] LocoMB#8593
appreciated

[05-Jun-19 01:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Verus Agama is a fork and has been verified as not vunerable

My balance appears to be 0 in the dashboard section (although I know I had my funds there) . I get an error when logging in though. So I cannot send anything to a different wallet. Do I have reason to be worried? Is this a normal problem?

[05-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Jochum#0696
That is, in the agama wallet

@tese you need to check the final destination

[05-Jun-19 02:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptopoli you shouldn't be generating new address in Agama V-0.3.6
use Verus agama as mentioned here: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

[05-Jun-19 02:03 PM] tese#3502
@mrlynch can you help me? I dont find  my address in the transaction

[05-Jun-19 02:03 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think www.Atomicexplorer.com died with all the traffic maybe

[05-Jun-19 02:04 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Were priv addresses compromised in Agama only if imported? Or also when using litemode?

[05-Jun-19 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Anything used with Lite is toast i believe

[05-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380

make sure you backup your restore key from chameleon if you do so
