it takes about 8 hours on average hardware spec.

[11-Jul-18 07:25 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
is there any stable precompiled binary?

[11-Jul-18 07:26 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
for ubuntu 16

[11-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Hermes#6934
you are using CLI right ? you are asking for some type of bootstrap for it not to load all the blocks from the beginning again right?

[11-Jul-18 07:31 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
yes

[11-Jul-18 07:31 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
Would appreciate someone can give me bootstrap

[11-Jul-18 07:32 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
upload it somewhere like gdrive, or whatever

[11-Jul-18 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it takes time to verify 916000+ blocks, that's just the simple truth of running a full node

[11-Jul-18 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*almost 917000

[11-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Hermes#6934
I wouldn't recommend looking for this , we understand that in some way it takes time, if you need to access and move your funds inmediatly you can use the private keys in lite mode and manage them there .

[11-Jul-18 07:45 PM] Hermes#6934
Here is an old bootstrap it seems , haven't tried this so...not so sure of the efficiency of it https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Agama-&-BarterDEX-GUI-Linux-VirtualBox-Image

@Hermes that's a full virtual machine image

[11-Jul-18 07:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not a bootstrap

[11-Jul-18 07:49 PM] Hermes#6934
yeah you are correct, we certainly don't have the files as he is looking for , this is the closest that we have to a solution .

[11-Jul-18 08:16 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448
can someone running komodo just archive blocks chainstate and database folders?

[11-Jul-18 08:16 PM] ! pinpin [zergpool.com]#1448

please send us a support ticket at support@komodoplatform.com in order to view this in detail send us the debug file you had also and the OS version that you are usgin @! pinpin [zergpool.com]

[12-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Mylo#8306
@! pinpin [zergpool.com] you can build from source following these instructions, it sounds like you have zcash-params already, so try this if you want to compile it rather than relying on a binary.
 - http://i.mylomylo.com/build-komodo-source

i might be able to set up a server you can rsync from, won't be for a few hours though

[12-Jul-18 05:37 AM] Mylo#8306
if you start komodod with -gen from the command line, it will mine (pointless on a single server) whilst it syncs and doing so makes the sync take a looooooooong time.  so when syncing don't put `-gen -genproclimit`

[12-Jul-18 05:37 AM] Mylo#8306
if that's what you were doing

[12-Jul-18 05:52 AM] k50#7856
Hi may I please ask regarding komodod for creating the Komodo Assetchain.
Say we have two hypothetical nodes up already:
1.2.3.4 (first)
1.2.3.5 (second)

and we now want to connect a third node do we connect to the first one only:
$ ./komodod [stuff_ommitted] -addnode=1.2.3.4 -gen &

or do we connect to all existing nodes:
$ ./komodod [stuff_ommitted] -addnode=1.2.3.4 -addnode=1.2.3.5 -gen &

Thanks

[12-Jul-18 05:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It wont matter... as long as the port is open to the interent on both nodes it will "find" any chains connected to any other chain from the one `addnode` parameter. It will just find them faster if you specify them all on the start command.

[12-Jul-18 06:07 AM] k50#7856
Thank you very much @blackjok3r.  Regarding the Komodo key value system, I think it is possible to use it as a NoSQL database with JSON like syntax. The problem I'm thinking is anyone with the key can see  it's value. I know there's a passphrase but that's for allowing updates to the user who created the key value data. Is there built in functionality to encrypt the value data? If not I think we just encrypt the data before storing it on the AssetChain. Please let me know my errors in logic. Thank you.

[12-Jul-18 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes as far as I am aware, you need to encrypt the data yourself before submitting.

[12-Jul-18 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not a lof of experience with that though unfortunately.

[12-Jul-18 06:24 AM] k50#7856
Thanks again @blackjok3r! Is there a limit on the size of the value store? I can't seem to find information on the size limit.

[12-Jul-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For that you would need to ask @Alright I think. He is currently sleeping, but feel free to drop him a PM, he should get back to you sometime later.

[12-Jul-18 06:41 AM] k50#7856
Ok thank you. Is it possible to setup a test dICO first (by creating a test AssetChain that has no value) so we know all the things we need to prepare in advance?

[12-Jul-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant see why not, but you would be better off talking to #chainmakers  or #chainzilla  about that kinds of stuff.

[12-Jul-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do it, but I have too many things on already lol.

About the sync issue on the `Ledger Wallet Bitcoin`, from `support.ledgerwallet.com`: ```I tried on my side and it works normally for KMD with the Chrome applications and also on the Ledger Live.
It may be cause by the KMD server.```

[12-Jul-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not sure what does `KMD server` even mean but I guess they are talking about the explorer.
