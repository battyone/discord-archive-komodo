Got some issues with the Agama wallet

[02-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Beijkido#8045
I'm not able to select the kmd native wallet

[02-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Beijkido#8045
And if I open the lite wallet, my balance is empty

[02-Sep-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Beijkido Could you please clarify a few moments:
 Which platform (Windows/MacOS/Linux) are you using and which version of Agama? 
Do you receive any error message when trying to open wallet in native mode? 
Did you send funds to address which was generated in native or lite mode?

[02-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Beijkido#8045
Mac, Version 0.2.41d-beta (0.2.41d)

[02-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Beijkido#8045
Nope, it basically deselects the kmd row, and nothing happens

[02-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Beijkido#8045
Native mode

[02-Sep-18 03:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@Beijkido Please try to reboot your PC and try to enter Agama native mode again

[02-Sep-18 03:06 PM] Nabob#5004
@Beijkido  may be  komodod runs in background, If you can check. else,  Restart Mac machine like tony said

[02-Sep-18 03:13 PM] Beijkido#8045
Ok

[02-Sep-18 03:13 PM] Beijkido#8045

[02-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c ok i appreciate it, wasnt my intention to troll

[02-Sep-18 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
@TonyL they are charging me $90 for the course, should i proceed or is there way to get free?

[02-Sep-18 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
@Deleted User 90$ you have to pay only in case if you want a paper certificate. This course is free

i think i need some help. I've got bdex running on a remote machine and another bdex on a local. My order that i place on the remote do not show up on the local but the orders i place on the local show up in the remote. Im looking at both instances on the local machine (remote bdex via ssh tunnel)
its almost like my orders on the remote are not being broadcast
but the advisories indicate my order is being placed

[02-Sep-18 07:51 PM] jspook16#3059
and both instances are 1.1.1-rc

[02-Sep-18 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
use different passphrases on different nodes

[02-Sep-18 08:06 PM] jspook16#3059
I do have a unique passphrase for each instance.

[02-Sep-18 08:07 PM] jspook16#3059
on the remote bdex, the remote order dont show on their either...but My Offers tab shows that they were placed

[02-Sep-18 08:38 PM] jspook16#3059
Figured it out. The "myipaddress" file in .Barterdex directory was empty for some reason. Put my ip in there manually, lanuched it and started giving all kinds of errors. I deleted the file and let bdex create it on the next launch and the ip was filled in and my orders are showing up now.

[02-Sep-18 08:39 PM] jspook16#3059
I wonder if that means that if I take my "laptop" and connect to a different network, if this file gets updated automatically. I'll test when I get a chance

[03-Sep-18 12:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@adrian.marinescu please don't private message asking general support questions.

[03-Sep-18 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll not answer general queries in private messages.

[03-Sep-18 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can change the p2p port of any assetchain just by changing the p2p port in config file

[03-Sep-18 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it should work just fine

[03-Sep-18 01:00 AM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@grewalsatinder I am sorry, I didn't know

[03-Sep-18 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no worries

[03-Sep-18 01:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
an assetchain sets it's port fixed

[03-Sep-18 01:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is not a dynamic p2p port

[03-Sep-18 01:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you use same assetchain params, you should always get the same p2p and rpc port

[03-Sep-18 01:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless you changed the name of the assetchain or supply or any other param etc

Re: `support here isnt as great as advertised`
In my experience the support and patience shown by everyone here has been very amazing!
There are times when I didn't understand the answers and when I couldn't get things working, but that was a function of my own lack of basic knowledge (I'm starting from 0).
By investing time in research and building of experience I've moved past those difficulties and move on to newer ones while gaining a bit more of an understanding.
Very grateful to you guys for all the help!

[03-Sep-18 11:45 AM] CrisF#3405
And now another question ;)
Is there a way send funds from an `address` rather than `account` for t-transactions?  Like `z_sendmany "fromaddress" [{"address":... ,"amount":...},...] ( minconf ) ( fee )` but from a t-address.

[03-Sep-18 11:47 AM] CrisF#3405
(or maybe something coming with `== Addressindex ==`??)

[03-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
use z_sendmany!

[03-Sep-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
"fromaddress" can be a t address

[03-Sep-18 11:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Haha, I must have messed something up before (on STAKED3).  I'll check it and give it another shot on STAKED4.  Thanks!

[03-Sep-18 12:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I remember now... the error message said something about it not being a privacy chain.

[03-Sep-18 10:24 PM] Bitcoiner#5383
Hey guys     port7771 is already taken  ?  What does it mean, how can i solve this problem ?

[03-Sep-18 10:26 PM] Hermes#6934
It means that komodod is already running in the background

[03-Sep-18 10:27 PM] Hermes#6934
check on the task manager to see if komodod is still running

[03-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Hermes#6934
@Bitcoiner  if it's still running you will need to shut it down , if it's CLI you will need to do the command ./komodo-cli stop in your terminal

[03-Sep-18 10:38 PM] Bitcoiner#5383
Thank you hermes  i try it

[04-Sep-18 05:55 AM] ! ariewayq ! The Real Human#4915

[04-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi there please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com also please send us information about the OS version you are running and also please try this guide and let us know through the ticket if it helped https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/162562089/Agama+Windows+Guide+How+to+Resync+from+scratch

[04-Sep-18 01:24 PM] Number32#2621

[04-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Number32#2621

[04-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Number32#2621

[04-Sep-18 01:25 PM] Hermes#6934
This should help

[04-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Number32#2621
@Hermes thank you

[04-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Hermes#6934
Do you see any type of antivirus that could have blocked komodod process ?

[04-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Number32#2621
i disabled antivirus but it was still not working

[04-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Number32#2621
older versions of Agama were working with antivirus enabled

[04-Sep-18 01:30 PM] Number32#2621
so I am trying to figure out why the komodo debug log is empty

[04-Sep-18 01:33 PM] Hermes#6934
Try this other guide and let us know if it helps with the issue https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/573767681/Agama+0.2.41d+Unable+to+establish+RPC+connection+on+MacOS

[04-Sep-18 01:34 PM] Hermes#6934
I will update the other older guide so that this can be included.

[04-Sep-18 01:34 PM] Hermes#6934
If that doesn‚Äôt help let us know through the ticket and we will test it you are using High Sierra 10.13.X right ?

[04-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Number32#2621
@Hermes I did everything on that

[04-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Number32#2621
that didn't help either

[04-Sep-18 01:44 PM] Number32#2621
i was aware of the update to 41d so i did that prior to running 41d

[04-Sep-18 01:44 PM] Number32#2621
and that too didn't help

[04-Sep-18 01:44 PM] Hermes#6934
Did you already uninstalled completely ?

[04-Sep-18 01:45 PM] Number32#2621
i didn't uninstall yet

[04-Sep-18 01:45 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok try it and let me know

[04-Sep-18 01:45 PM] Number32#2621
i wanted to reinstall to an older version

[04-Sep-18 01:45 PM] Number32#2621
so I could move my KMD else where

[04-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Number32#2621
I am going to put tis down

[04-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Number32#2621
need to go to sleep

[04-Sep-18 01:46 PM] Hermes#6934

[04-Sep-18 01:47 PM] Number32#2621

@Hermes hi .. sorry noob here... is this a new release for
App Agama Wallet for android?

link : https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/agama-mobile/releases/download/v0.0.7/agama-mobile-v0.0.7.apk

If so, do i have to uninstall 0.1.0 and install new version 0.0.7?
Can i use PIN on new version?

[04-Sep-18 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
0.0.7 is older than 0.1.0

[04-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Hermes#6934
I always erase the last version when I install but if I recall correctly you should be able to use the same pin , but also because of it being a testing wallet make sure to have your seed written down correctly and confirm that you have access to your funds by entering the wallet with it only at least 2 times.

[04-Sep-18 07:59 PM] pbca26#5430
uninstall is not necessary
0.0.7 and 0.1.0 are backward compatible

uninstalling 41-beta on ubuntu on one of my laptops.

I installed it awhile ago, and I did it wrong back then.

I installed everything in the /usr/src/ directory, but I think I should have installed it in /opt/

[04-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
How do I properly uninstall? I don't see a ./uninstall option in here.

[04-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Hermes#6934
You installed it on /usr/src ? Or do you mean that you were using the portable version and located the file in that directory?

[04-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
On this laptop, I put it in /usr/src/ and then installed it within that folder.

I don't have anything on this laptop in the /opt/ folder, which is where I think we're supposed to install it.

[04-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
should I just delete the folder, and save the wallet.dat file? Or is there more to be done?

[04-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
^ the agama folder

[04-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Hermes#6934
If you don't have a pin saved for lite mode in that folder , you can erase the program but the setup should have detected any previous version and let you uninstall as normal,  in regards to the wallet.dat file that's located in the Komodo folder not Agamas folder so it wont affect it

[04-Sep-18 11:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not using lite mode here, so it should be okay...

What do you mean, 'uninstall as normal'?

[04-Sep-18 11:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Should I just download the new version and install it into the correct location? Will it automatically unistall the existing installation?

[04-Sep-18 11:51 PM] Hermes#6934
yes with the setup it should overwrite in the previous version without having to erase the folder

[05-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I removed the folder, downloaded the .tar.gz file, extracted it, moved it into /usr/src, and the tried executing `./AgamaApp...`, but I get an error saying "No such file or directory"

[05-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What am I missing?

[05-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Hermes#6934
are you in the correct path ?
