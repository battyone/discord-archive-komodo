[19-Dec-18 07:54 PM] Hermes#6934
Haven't tested the tar files in Windows...they should be essentially the same extension..but not quite sure.

@Nabob my balance is on explorer but wallet still not synching

[20-Dec-18 02:09 AM] Hermes#6934
KMD wallet?

[20-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Hermes#6934
when you say not synching you mean stuck in a block or komodod crashed @REKT Queen

[20-Dec-18 06:10 AM] REKT Queen#6380

will send you pic in DM

[20-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Hermes#6934

[20-Dec-18 06:27 AM] Hermes#6934

[20-Dec-18 06:36 AM] REKT Queen#6380
@Hermes yes I only downloaded 3 days ago

[20-Dec-18 06:37 AM] Hermes#6934
You are using lite mode right ?

[20-Dec-18 06:37 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Yes

[20-Dec-18 06:37 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Did you see screenshot I sent

[20-Dec-18 06:37 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes there seems to be some AV or firewall blocking the connection

[20-Dec-18 06:38 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Hmm ok üò¨

[20-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Hermes#6934
You can also try changing server but most likely there is some AV blocking the connection for Agama

[20-Dec-18 06:41 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Just checked and it‚Äôs allow all  wallet .. inbound .. not listed on outbound at all

[20-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Outbound ?

[20-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Outbound connections ?

[20-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Hermes#6934
They should also be allowed if you want to sync with the server

[20-Dec-18 06:48 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Appears my version is 2.43d-beta. üò¨ I‚Äôm confused I only downloaded a couple of days ago ! Do I just download new version?

[20-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes that should solve the issue

[20-Dec-18 06:50 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Doh

[20-Dec-18 06:51 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Is there anything specific I have to do ? Do you have a guide

[20-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Nabob#5004
Nothing, please update your wallet first, you dont have mandatory version updates

[20-Dec-18 07:12 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Done ‚úÖ worked it out üòÉ even got my reward üòç

[20-Dec-18 11:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes @Nabob 

I haven't had time to work on this error. Haven't been able to access komodo daemon in awhile now.

When I do `make clean` to do a full manual reinstall/update, I get this error:

```
checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... no
configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)
Makefile:556: recipe for target 'config.status' failed
make: *** [config.status] Error 1
```

[20-Dec-18 11:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did `git clean -f` several times.

[20-Dec-18 11:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Still getting the same error.

[20-Dec-18 11:39 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I seem to recall there being something else I could try as well, and I tried it at the time and didn't get a result... memory is vague....

[20-Dec-18 11:46 AM] Nabob#5004
@Bryan_Beus  check if you are on linux, search for libdb_cxx package aready installed

updatedb &; locate libdb_cxx

[20-Dec-18 11:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the cxx is a stand in reference

[20-Dec-18 11:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
siddhartha@aang:~/komodo$ locate libdb_cxx

[20-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Nabob#5004
did you tried to install 
```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev```

[20-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I will try it now

[20-Dec-18 11:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did those three commands, and then tried `make clean`.

Same error.

[20-Dec-18 11:52 AM] Nabob#5004
copy /usr/lib/libdb_cxx-4.8.so to /usr/lib64

[20-Dec-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[20-Dec-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
done

[20-Dec-18 11:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
same error

[20-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Nabob#5004
you are on which ubuntu version? i see you have higher libdb version binaries may be that conflucts with, am not sure !!

[20-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
17.10

[20-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh... that's right

[20-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think we said that I needed to upgrade to 18.10

[20-Dec-18 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm... I guess right now must be my moment to upgrade...

[20-Dec-18 11:57 AM] Nabob#5004
16.04 is perfect for me

[20-Dec-18 12:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Looks like updating to 18.10 is going to be a major PITA.

Hmm, I may just not be able to get komodo running for awhile...

[20-Dec-18 12:19 PM] Nabob#5004
just hit ldconfig

[20-Dec-18 12:19 PM] Nabob#5004
and try

[20-Dec-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
zcutil/build.sh

[20-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
^ I've done that three times today, and did it a good five times last time I tried installing. 

Here's the error:

```

[20-Dec-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
install libtool?

[20-Dec-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
build.sh usually gets all dependencies in but sometimes it doesnt and you just need to manually get it installed

[20-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

If we need to wait until I find time to update to Ubuntu 18.10, that's okay.

Hi,  I'm getting an error while trying to send  t-->z
```error code: -8

[21-Dec-18 02:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF is it KMD you are trying?

[21-Dec-18 02:10 PM] CrisF#3405
(difference above is using `"` and `'`.)

[21-Dec-18 02:10 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, KMD

[21-Dec-18 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it is disabled for now

[21-Dec-18 02:15 PM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks.

[21-Dec-18 02:16 PM] CrisF#3405
btw, JUMBLR showed `validateadress` on std which I haven't noticed before.

[22-Dec-18 01:10 AM] agnewpickens#7393
I have been trying to sync Pirate in my Agama wallet, Native and have been stuck at exactly 99.87% and same block since the 3.1 wallet release.

[22-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Hermes#6934
At which block you are stuck @agnewpickens  ?

[22-Dec-18 01:11 AM] Hermes#6934

Sorry, computer locked up, trying to do too many things at once.

[22-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Hermes#6934
Use this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000026963-stuck-or-forked-chain-/en      to enter the CLI and use the command reconsiderblock  00000001500922f7db74b9d82b745f84ebec28b0d5ea00d2a8af53207f3a63c1 instead of the one showed in the guide...

[22-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Hermes#6934
After that stop the wallet and rescan it ...

[22-Dec-18 01:20 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Thanks, I can do that, had to relaunch Agama anway.

[22-Dec-18 01:20 AM] agnewpickens#7393

[22-Dec-18 01:21 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Nope, link doesn't take me anywhere.
