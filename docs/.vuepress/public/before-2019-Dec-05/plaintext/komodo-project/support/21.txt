@Nabob thanks, progress being made. Now I have the coins I want set up and set for startup, but balances don't seem to be updating.

[30-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Nabob#5004
are you following electrum way or native ? just do reset local coins db and update coins fetch and relaunch bdex

[30-Jul-18 06:01 PM] nasbats#7785
electrum. will try resetting everything again

[30-Jul-18 06:14 PM] nasbats#7785
tried once again to reset, and balances all still showing 0 (confirmed on atomicexplorer that balances are there)

[30-Jul-18 06:15 PM] nasbats#7785
maybe it's just the network I'm behind. will try again later from a different network

[30-Jul-18 06:16 PM] Hermes#6934

EQL chain native sync gets stuck at block 61428 on native  windows agama 2.41

[31-Jul-18 12:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
anyone else can reproduce this issue?

[31-Jul-18 12:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I already tested linux and there is no issue there.

[31-Jul-18 01:15 AM] Hermes#6934
Will be reproducing shortly I saw something similar with Zilla

[31-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Hermes#6934
@c2k  Which pair you were using ?

[31-Jul-18 01:28 AM] c2k#4915
no pair i just cant log in

[31-Jul-18 01:29 AM] c2k#4915
i can get into bdex with my passphrase

[31-Jul-18 01:29 AM] c2k#4915
but not hdex bc i get the error above

[31-Jul-18 01:29 AM] c2k#4915
@Hermes

[31-Jul-18 01:31 AM] c2k#4915
and bdex was not open when i tried opening hdex.

[31-Jul-18 01:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Hermes seems to be an issue with komodod on agama 0.2.41 for windows

[31-Jul-18 01:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
may be something that affects other chains too. Please keep alert

[31-Jul-18 02:00 AM] Hermes#6934
That has happened when I have bad connection

[31-Jul-18 02:00 AM] Hermes#6934
Do you see marketmaker launching in the task manager ?

[31-Jul-18 02:02 AM] Hermes#6934
@c2k

[31-Jul-18 03:03 AM] Hermes#6934
@siu - Chainmakers  I see the same issue on Linux and Mac

[31-Jul-18 03:04 AM] Hermes#6934
stuck on block 61428  there seems to be no connection to any peer

[31-Jul-18 03:04 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It worked for me on linux

[31-Jul-18 03:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But yeah. Stuck in block 61428

[31-Jul-18 03:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A new daemon fixes it

[31-Jul-18 03:07 AM] Hermes#6934
Now it finished loading on MAC

[31-Jul-18 03:08 AM] Hermes#6934
Now it finihsed on Linux also

[31-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Hermes#6934
It seems that the last 5 % is not reflected in the loading status

[31-Jul-18 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A fork happened on block 61428

[31-Jul-18 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like there are some nodes on that forked chain

[31-Jul-18 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So while mac and linux load, they stop briefly on that block while windows corrupts the chain and cant keep going

[31-Jul-18 10:38 AM] c2k#4915
sorry @Hermes i had to go to sleep. 
no i didnt see maketmaker launch in tm (didnt look actually)
but i uninstalled and reinstalled it and its back working now. ty

[31-Jul-18 11:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hi guys, any updates? Seems like the Ocean QT wallet daemons have the same issue

[31-Jul-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu - Chainmakers i'll test on windows now

[31-Jul-18 12:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@Hermes many thanks

[01-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What do you do when you have a transaction that didn't process? 

I sent a normal t transaction, using Agama, and it somehow didn't get picked up by the network. 

The TXID isn't found in the KMD explorer.

However, the wallet recognizes the transaction, though it has 0 confirmations.

?

[01-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Nabob#5004
its normal, if its struck means transaction is not confirmed , smtimes kmd chain takes 20 min to generate a block , on which coin you have this

[01-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
kmd

[01-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, I'll just leave it. 

Just making sure I don't need to rebroadcast a transaction or something. 

Sounds like it'll eventually resolve. 

It's 39 confirmations overdue, though.

[01-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Nabob#5004
if it not resolves, try to relauch daemon and make sure your longest chain matches with explorer blocks

Is Barter DEX no longer supported, none of my coin balances are showing for my new wallet I just set up there.  Not even KMD.  I have 1.1.0-rc on Win 7.

I'll let the folks in DNR Discord know.

[01-Aug-18 09:54 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Still not showing my coin balances, will try rebooting.

[01-Aug-18 09:55 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Weird, old wallet shows fine, new one doesn't

[01-Aug-18 09:58 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Looks like it only works when I use the WIF and not the seed phrase, balances are back.  Sorry to bother y'all.

[01-Aug-18 09:58 PM] agnewpickens#7393
DNR balance still not showing in 1.1.1

[01-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Hermes#6934
ok so when you enter the private keys you see your balance?

[01-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Hermes#6934
I am going to test I have some DNR

[01-Aug-18 10:41 PM] Hermes#6934
@agnewpickens  I am seeing my DNR on Hyperdex you can use the same seed as Barterdex

[01-Aug-18 10:42 PM] Hermes#6934
Testing DNR on Bdex right now

[01-Aug-18 10:42 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Unfortunately I used the same name for my new Agama wallet as I used for my HyperDEX on my old wallet.  üò¶

[01-Aug-18 10:43 PM] Hermes#6934
Your same passphrase ?

[01-Aug-18 10:44 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Nope

[01-Aug-18 10:44 PM] agnewpickens#7393
My original wallet was from the Basilisk days of Agama and I figured generating a fresh wallet would be more robust.

[01-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hermes#6934
So you created a new seed on lite mode for Agama and you used that same seed on Hyperdex?

[01-Aug-18 10:46 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Ugh, have created a mess for myself.  How do I import my WIF for a new HD account?

[01-Aug-18 10:46 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Ah, I created another seed, gotta nix that.  Getting tricky on me with two DEXes and two wallets now.

[01-Aug-18 10:48 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Have horrible allergies today, gonna wait until I can think more clearly, have to go get some more sinus meds.

[01-Aug-18 10:50 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Checking my original seeded wallet on Barter DEX now, it is the new seed not showing my Barter DEX balances

[01-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Hermes#6934
And your old seed you have it with you right?

[01-Aug-18 10:50 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Yerp, all that stuff is saved.

[01-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Hermes#6934
I will recommend consolidating all the balances in no more than two wallets that you fully control with your seed

[01-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Hermes#6934
You will only need two seeds one for your wallet and one for your trading

[01-Aug-18 10:51 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Problem is I now share my original wallet with a friend in exchange for him hosting a ZEN SN share, I am managing his KMD interest claims.

[01-Aug-18 10:52 PM] agnewpickens#7393
So want to leave that wallet alone right now

[01-Aug-18 10:53 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I'll figure it out, you haven't lost my funds yet, going all the way back to some DGB I sent to my Agama wallet over a year ago.

[01-Aug-18 10:54 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Just can't see my balances, I know the funds are there.

[01-Aug-18 10:55 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Have to run to $ store and get some more sinus meds, I am patient, just reporting the issue.

[01-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok just test DNR on the new BDEX release it's not showing the balance but in Hyperdex it does

[01-Aug-18 10:59 PM] Hermes#6934
As long as you have the seed with the DNR you can select the option that says Restore Portfolio on Hyperdex there you will enter your seed and you should be good to go
