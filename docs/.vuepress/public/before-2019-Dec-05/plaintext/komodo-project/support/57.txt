so to see mobile wallet balance

[01-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Torankoku#4818
i have to send most recent tx in native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:31 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't like change address, don't use native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Torankoku#4818
that is thing, see

[01-Dec-18 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
send all funds to your mobile wallet address, and use only Lite mode or mobile wallet from that point forward

[01-Dec-18 07:32 PM] Torankoku#4818
kmd support told me i have to use native mode to see balance in mobile wallet

[01-Dec-18 07:32 PM] SHossain#0007
what ticket number?

[01-Dec-18 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have funds in your native wallet in a different change address and you don't see them in mobile wallet, you need to use native mode first to send funds in the address where that you are using in mobile.

[01-Dec-18 07:34 PM] Torankoku#4818
why does it automatically create a address though?

[01-Dec-18 07:34 PM] SHossain#0007
have you ever used BTC in native mode?

[01-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Torankoku#4818
no, only electrum

[01-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Torankoku#4818
you cannot assume everyone here is used to running btc in native mode or run nodes

[01-Dec-18 07:35 PM] Torankoku#4818
different ways to support ecosystem

read this wiki to understand about change address

[01-Dec-18 07:39 PM] Torankoku#4818
to fix this problem, how? send funds from original address to original address?

[01-Dec-18 07:39 PM] Torankoku#4818
in native mode, yes?

[01-Dec-18 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
To fix this, you need to send funds to your mobile wallet address or any other address that is not listed in your native wallet using native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
or, export the private key of the address that contains the funds and use Agama lite mode to login using the privkey to send the funds to your desired address

[01-Dec-18 08:04 PM] Nabob#5004
@Torankoku  why you are in panic ? native mode is used to handle multiple address and spv/ mobile uses single address.

after you claim funds,  your remaining funds move to change address in your same wallet, i have seen your receive tab screenshot. funds are there within your wallet

[01-Dec-18 08:05 PM] Torankoku#4818
this is automatic?

[01-Dec-18 08:06 PM] Nabob#5004
dont check funds on mobile yet it will show single address funds, like @SHossain  said you need to understand concepts first

[01-Dec-18 08:07 PM] Torankoku#4818
so wait a few days, is what you are saying?

[01-Dec-18 08:07 PM] Nabob#5004
nothing is automatic, now your immediate action, send full funds to your original address

[01-Dec-18 08:07 PM] Torankoku#4818
ok

[01-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Seko#7408
Does Komodo's Hardfork also take place for all assetchains that use the Sapling upgrade?  Does it mean that also for Pirate this Hard-Fork in the technical sense will take place?

[01-Dec-18 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes, most of them. Pirate will be hardforked as well. but, there is not chain split

[01-Dec-18 09:12 PM] SHossain#0007
just the main chain

komodod: main.cpp:3640: void PruneBlockIndexCandidates(): Assertion `!setBlockIndexCandidates.empty()' failed.
does anyone know what this means? happens everytime I start kmd, i have to add -reindex to get it running and then wait 20 hours while it reindexes....fix? thanks

[01-Dec-18 11:49 PM] SHossain#0007
backup wallet.dat file first. then, delete all files from data dir except wallet.dat and start the wallet again.

[02-Dec-18 02:00 AM] skyguynca#0562
ok, will try it, thanks

[02-Dec-18 04:36 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Team  Admin @Admin Hi guys when I am trying to perform the first atomic swap. I am getting different results when running the enable_my script with this
```source userpass
./setpassphrase > /dev/null
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"
curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:5426" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ABP\"}"
```
I am getting no output with regards to ABP, while wallet is running on the instance.

When changing the port back to 7783 for ABP I get this result

``` % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

{"error":"couldnt find coin"}```

I really appreciate your guidance in this matter. I think it may have to do with ABP's coin integration, as we have submitted all info to the jl777c/coins repo.

Thanks again guys! Really appreciate it!

[02-Dec-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Noted , in this case you may have to wait for the integration request . I am sure you should have a response soon.

[02-Dec-18 05:00 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Hermes Our pull request has already been accepted and integrated within the repo.

[02-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Hermes#6934

@Hermes Yeah strange would you know why?

[02-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Hermes#6934
not sure but it isn't an error from my side ...because it's what is being showed with a fresh installation of Barterdex

[02-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Hermes#6934
I have seen undefined when the coins.json file needs to be created again or gets corrupted.

[02-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Hermes#6934
I am sure they will look into this 😉

[02-Dec-18 05:19 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Ok! Perfect, so what do you advise me to do send an email to support?

[02-Dec-18 05:19 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I already did, and sent what I did above.

[02-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Hermes#6934
You sent it to support@komodoplatform.com ?

Yeah!

👌 

[02-Dec-18 05:51 AM] Hermes#6934
Also you have your ABP wallet userdata in the %appdata% directory as default ?

[02-Dec-18 06:41 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@Hermes I am doing this on Debian 9.

[02-Dec-18 06:42 AM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Through the terminal, all files are contained within /root/.abp directory.

[02-Dec-18 09:43 AM] skyguynca#0562

[02-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cryptosid:matrix.org> And regarding the "Full Rebrand", what is the plan? new name?

[02-Dec-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Dec-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Dec-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cryptosid:matrix.org> I'm often checking on github but a  notification would be nice

[02-Dec-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763

hi all

[02-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Maroof#6879
hey guys
qq - from my friend - when logging in with the seed which he printed, the 24 words load a different wallet
when using kmd explorer and loading the old wallet address we can see that fine but for some reason using that seed is not loading that wallet in agama
mine is fine
this is in agama

[02-Dec-18 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
most likely your friend's seed has been modified or trying with wrong one. deleting or adding an empty space would make a different address. check this post for more details. https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024514-common-wallet-issues

[02-Dec-18 12:47 PM] hasaai#0035
Hi Maroof

[02-Dec-18 12:47 PM] hasaai#0035
Thanks for posting the question

[02-Dec-18 12:48 PM] hasaai#0035
Support - the problem I have is that I can't access the wallet that has my KMD balance. I'm using my password to login and it logs me into another wallet address

[02-Dec-18 12:48 PM] hasaai#0035
when I use the seed then same - it logs me into a different address

[02-Dec-18 12:49 PM] hasaai#0035
I can see via KMD Explorer that my original wallet which has the balance is still there. I just don't know why I can't access my wallet

[02-Dec-18 12:50 PM] hasaai#0035
Is there a way to directly access the wallet address

[02-Dec-18 12:50 PM] hasaai#0035
I have my wallet.dat file if that helps

[02-Dec-18 12:57 PM] Nabob#5004
@hasaai  Please raise Support Ticket to us, we will troubleshoot from there.
support@komodoplatform.com

[02-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Nabob#5004
If you have wallet.dat means , earlier you used Native mode right ? If yes, Then from lite mode if you want to check  you need to parse correct Privatekey while Login, Then only it shows your valid address.

[02-Dec-18 01:00 PM] hasaai#0035
when you say private key

[02-Dec-18 01:00 PM] hasaai#0035
you mean seed right?

Private key

[02-Dec-18 01:04 PM] hasaai#0035
ok but when I use my password then it still opens the incorrect wallet address

[02-Dec-18 01:04 PM] hasaai#0035
and when I use seed it opens the incorrect wallet address

[02-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Nabob#5004
How you got seed from wallet.dat file, earlier you used Native Mode right  ?

[02-Dec-18 01:06 PM] Nabob#5004
If you have funds in wallet.dat file,  You need to retrieve private key from that file, in order to login In Lite mode

[02-Dec-18 01:07 PM] hasaai#0035
No. When I installed Agama I created the wallet using lite. I was prompted to create a seed and I took a snapshot straightaway

[02-Dec-18 01:07 PM] hasaai#0035
today as i couldn't access the wallet, I've tried to login via native

[02-Dec-18 01:07 PM] hasaai#0035
and via lite

[02-Dec-18 01:07 PM] hasaai#0035
native though doesn't require a p/w or seed

[02-Dec-18 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
do you see balance using native mode?

[02-Dec-18 01:09 PM] hasaai#0035
no

[02-Dec-18 01:10 PM] hasaai#0035
Maroof on here transferred KMD to me

[02-Dec-18 01:10 PM] SHossain#0007

[02-Dec-18 01:10 PM] hasaai#0035

[02-Dec-18 01:11 PM] hasaai#0035
