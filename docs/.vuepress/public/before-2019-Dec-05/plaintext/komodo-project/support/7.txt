[29-Jun-18 04:00 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah it can be caused by the antivirus not allowing C access

Hi, in SuperNET/iguana what are the the differences between the scripts in exchanges and dexscripts?

[30-Jun-18 02:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
exchanges have some example shell scripts and come c files. there is an `install` script as will, if you execute that it will copy those example shell scripts to dexscripts.
reason for that is if you update or change any of the scripts in the exchanges dir and later do `git pull` you will get issues updating, as git will complain of either discarding local changes or overwriting from git commits updates. for that reason a blank dir dexscripts is there, which is not pushed with update and any changes user makes there doesn't affect git pull updates.

[30-Jun-18 02:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's the only diff

[30-Jun-18 02:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Thank you, @grewalsatinder.

[30-Jun-18 04:35 AM] allbits#5898
So I'm ready to start trying out komodo on the command line. I've got a couple of basic questions.  First, in the conf file what exactly are the rpcuser and password for? I see it says to use strong username and password. How strong? Do they need to be backed up? Thanks

[30-Jun-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it just controls how cli communicates with the komodod

[30-Jun-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to back it up but make sure it isnt "password" as that would allow hostile programs to potentially access the daemon. it is limited to localhost but still better safe than sorry

[30-Jun-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and dont use any real passphrase from crypto wallet

[30-Jun-18 07:39 AM] allbits#5898
Thank you

This new version release changelog:

* Fixed settings save bug that got socket timeout param broken
* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.

When I uninstalled and reinstalled, I'm now getting an error message that says a JavaScript error has occured

[01-Jul-18 12:59 AM] Hermes#6934
Hi there while running the program or while installing @Chris11111 ?

[01-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Chris11111#2957
Right after the uninstaller finishes and asks if I want to launch. I hit yes, then it comes up with the JavaScript error.

[01-Jul-18 01:13 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok have you tried running the installer after that ?

[01-Jul-18 01:13 AM] Hermes#6934
2.41 right?

[01-Jul-18 01:13 AM] Chris11111#2957
I did another uninstall/reinstall after that and the same thing happened.

[01-Jul-18 01:14 AM] Chris11111#2957
and yes 2.41

[01-Jul-18 01:15 AM] Hermes#6934
Do you use a seed to enter your wallet or do you use a pin or password to enter it

[01-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Chris11111#2957
I use a seed

[01-Jul-18 01:16 AM] Hermes#6934
If you use a seed to enter it you can erase the Agama folder in %appdata% manually and try a reinstall

[01-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok you can proceed you can go to %appdata% and erase the Agama folder and try a reinstall

[01-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Chris11111#2957
Seed I believe I should say. I use electrum mode.

[01-Jul-18 01:18 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes that‚Äôs lite mode just make sure you have a copy of it and proceed with erasing the Agama folder in appdata and try the installer again

[01-Jul-18 01:19 AM] Chris11111#2957
alright will do thank you

[01-Jul-18 01:33 AM] Chris11111#2957
@Hermes Now my antivirus is flagging the install

[01-Jul-18 01:35 AM] Hermes#6934
Most probably you will need to unblock it most antiviruses are detecting crypto related software as malware

[01-Jul-18 01:36 AM] Chris11111#2957
It says it contains a trojan? Why would agama need to contain a trojan?

[01-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Hermes#6934
It doesn‚Äôt you can check in virustotal.com

[01-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Hermes#6934
There is no such Trojan which av you are using ?

[01-Jul-18 02:11 AM] Chris11111#2957
Windows Defender

[01-Jul-18 02:14 AM] Hermes#6934
Yep most probably you will need to unblock it normally this happens because the program is asking a C installation and antivirus can pick it up as a threat

[01-Jul-18 02:17 AM] Chris11111#2957
Thank you for the insight. I was a little cautious since this was the first time that has happened since installing my very first Agama version almost 8 months ago.

[01-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Hermes#6934
Did it worked ?

[01-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Chris11111#2957
Not sure yet, I will try that when I get back to the house.

[01-Jul-18 06:32 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We as Marmara group,  participated in a competition in the first blockchain hackathon in Turkey  on friday. It is still going on. Our project is called FarmChain. It is a decentralized system to establish farms with investors, and connect them in a bazaar (market) where people can buy directly from farmers. A percentage of products will go to investors. It is based on Ethereum smart contracts. Name of token is FarmCoin. It is ERC20. Can we add this to Barterdex today before competition ends? It would be wonderful since almost all projects are in ethereum (maybe one or two are in Hyperledger) and noone will be able to add it into an exchange.

[01-Jul-18 06:38 AM] farukterzioglu#1590
I am at the team of @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner, we already developed the application. 
But in order to buy assets from our application, people need to buy our token. 
It is already mentioned in mentor's presantation that, the price to be listed in exchanges is huge. 

So we want to demonstrate, we got listed in an exchange (BarterDex) and already have market cap. We want to show people already started to buy out token to use in application.

[01-Jul-18 06:42 AM] farukterzioglu#1590
Since it is a hackathon, we dont need fully qualified application, just for demostration. And we dont have enough time to work on Barterdex. 

But we want to show the power of Komodo platform. As some of you know, we "Marmara Blockchain Community", had been working with Komodo. 

Any help would help us too much for listing our token in Barterdex and demostrate some atomic swaps.  Sorry to say that we dont have enought time to read, learn, try Barterdex. 
So we may need direct help from a very kind person üòÉ

look in github.com/jl777/coins for other ERC20 coins and make a similar  pull request, once it is in the repo, it will automatically be selectable in barterDEX

no connections to electurm servers

[01-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart
this wasn't in earlier releases.
BarterDEX has reached a point where it actually works with "too many" coins.
The current solution seemed the best option, I'm sure that over time it will become more intuitive and "user-friendly"

[01-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
