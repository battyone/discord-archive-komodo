that agama bug was very disaapoitning to see also

[11-Aug-19 09:50 AM] Razzler04#2552
anyway, I'll have to come back in 2- 3 days

[11-Aug-19 09:50 AM] Razzler04#2552
thanks for your help

[11-Aug-19 02:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@Razzler04 as I've said already, the version from the website and the github link are the same
it is just the internal versioning is different and it reads different from the version in the release tag
I've even sent you a screnshot from my own computer to show that I am using the same version as you

in one of your last mails you said your hard disk didn't have space
could that be causing issues again?

[11-Aug-19 02:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@Exile13 thanks for pointing the broken links, its updated now

[11-Aug-19 02:49 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Razzler04 there are options for the impatient. quickest is lite mode with https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
or you can get a bootstrap from https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php

[11-Aug-19 10:45 PM] anushr#3299
I was using Agama Wallet version 0.3.1 in Native Mode  and my funds ( only KMD) are stuck. I browsed help topics online and it seems to suggest that I should just download Verus wallet. I don't have any private key created. I had been using Agama for a while and after I heard about vulneribility, I tried emailing the team using support link in website to check how I should do this upgrade ( as I'm not a techie). So would appreciate if someone can guide me on what I should do upgrade/migrate to Verus Wallet from Agama Wallet version 0.3.1 . When I check the Wallet Info, it does show my funds are there but it won't sync fully.

[12-Aug-19 12:01 AM] Razzler04#2552
@gcharang the hard disk space issue is no longer relevant as that has been taken care of

[12-Aug-19 12:02 AM] Razzler04#2552
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I'm not impatient, I just want to get this going, but appreciate your suggestion

[12-Aug-19 12:03 AM] Razzler04#2552
I'm currently down to three weeks again and the block count is still going ahead.  will see what happens.

@anushr if you use native mode,  update to verus agama, it will find your wallet.dat and continue syncing. Good idea to secure your seed and private key tho - https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024424-how-to-secure-your-wallet-seed-private-keys-wallet-dat-file

@EC you should be able to find the daemon path in native mode Agama by clicking on the `i` information button

Hi team, I have just upgraded my Agama wallet from v0.2.0 to v0.5.7. Haven't opened the wallet in ages basically. I do have a wallet.dat backup though. I wanna be more actively involved again. How do I go about reinstating my (old) wallet? Your guidance is appreciated.

[12-Aug-19 08:54 AM] veRx#7033
Also, I heard that (some) wallet balances have been moved to preempt a security issue. How can I ascertain whether my wallet was also affected, and how do I recover my balance if indeed affected?

[12-Aug-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you were on v0.2.0 your funds would be unaffected. The vunerability was isolated to some versions of 0.3.x

[12-Aug-19 09:20 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

with native mode, just starting the updated wallet with your existing wallet.dat in situ (and waiting for it to sync) will work. It is highly recommended to secure your seed and private keys though, otherwise if your hard drive or computer breaks you lose the wallet.dat and the funds within.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator How long is the sync process likely to take if I'm on block 792819 currently?

[12-Aug-19 10:00 AM] veRx#7033
Also, the display of the wallet states it is syncing ('Synchronization in progress...'), but I do not see the block number increase (it remains on 792819). Is this normal wallet behavior?

[12-Aug-19 10:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you probably need to reindex

[12-Aug-19 10:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
alternatively you can use a bootstrap

[12-Aug-19 10:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it all depends on your bandwidth, but a reindex takes a few hours

[12-Aug-19 10:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Any advice much appreciated

[13-Aug-19 03:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@G888 can you confirm that you are using native mode?

[13-Aug-19 04:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@G888 
Find the Komodo data directory. Depending on the OS, the location is as follows:

Linux: ~/.komodo
macOS/OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo
Windows: %APPDATA%/Komodo

delete the following files/folders

blocks
chainstate
notarisations
komodostate
komodostate.ind
peers.dat

DO NOT delete wallet.dat
back it up

download https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz
extract it into the Komodo directory

[13-Aug-19 04:23 PM] G888#0307
Yes - in native mode

Guys I really need some help and hope someone can guide me. 

I have trouble with my Agama wallet 0.3.6 beta getting stuck at block 1444268. I have tried with reindex and rescan functions but it never makes it past that block.

I am unsure whether this is related to the hack event - the reason I want to move my funds - but am pretty stumped as to how I should proceed and afraid to lose my funds. 

What exact procedure should one follow? I read about people installing the verus version, but what exact steps do i need to take to make sure i can trasnfer or find my funds in that wallet?

I have always used native mode. 

A big thanks to anyone who can help!!

[14-Aug-19 10:25 AM] phm87#7395
@Tropical Miner Other pplencountered a similar error. Search for 1444268 in the discord and you will find answers. In few words, always use a recent code as suggested by blackjok3r and
- you can stop then strart komodod with -maxreorg=2500
- you can stop komodo then delete blockchain except wallet.dat (backup wallet.dat securely) and restart it. To speed up sync, you can download kmd bootstrap from dexstats then uncompress it

[14-Aug-19 11:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Tropical Miner I assume you;ve downloaded and installed Verus Agama. I assume your wallet.dat file from running in native earlier is still in its original folder. If so, all you need to do is successfully sync the chain, or extract your private key and use lite mode.

[14-Aug-19 11:15 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
to get your private key, load up Verus Agama and go to the recieve screen, then follow the image below

-use the link ( https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024428-komodo-5-active-user-reward-all-you-need-to-know ) to view receive my rewards

[17-Aug-19 09:28 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
From the links provided above
"Ledger doesn't have the ability to enable timelock"
So you in fact can not use ledger. You need a 3 party wallet.
