If you sent from an exchange or another wallet, sometimes the lock time doesn't set properly. To fix it you just send the full balance to yourself using Chameleon, and make sure it's above 10KMD.

[19-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@PTYX ok I didn't know you could sent funds to yourself. And yes I'd sent my kmd from an exchange. I'll give it a try thanks!

[19-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Elmis#0347
I sent the small quantity of jumblr that I enter in my old account to the new one in Agama Verus and I have not received my jumblr.
When I filled out the document to claim I made a mistake in the amount and maybe that's why it hasn't been sent. What should I do now to solve it if something needs to be done?

[19-Jun-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
what address?

[19-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Elmis#0347
the old one is:     RA9G36WwA9K95bn8Cbycq5ZnoxhSzzhhBw

[19-Jun-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the amount you claimed was over double, it triggered an alert

[19-Jun-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i have it as 553, if that is correct, i can update and it will process immediate

[19-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Elmis#0347
Yes, that is correct

[19-Jun-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Jun-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Elmis#0347
Thanks, I have also a problem with Hush, just a litle quantity that was in the same address ¬øyou know something about this one?

[19-Jun-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Elmis#0347
received jumblr, thanks

[19-Jun-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see that adress in the HUSH claims data

[19-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Elmis#0347
I send it alone some days later in a new  claim document

[19-Jun-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe make another claim just in case. i have data current as of the weekend, so if you filed before that, it got lost somehow

[19-Jun-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i will process it next week, if that is ok

[19-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Elmis#0347
OK I wil do. I also had in that account a small amount of coquis and a slightly larger zilla what should I do to recover them?

[19-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
just login with old passphrase and transfer them

[19-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Elmis#0347
I will try, thanks

The refund Process


We will use a three-step process for processing claim:



1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.

2. You need to send all the funds from the compromised address to the destination address you specified in the form.

3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made to the destination address specified in the form. This does not happen automatically (we double-check every claim), so we kindly ask you to be patient. At this point, your claim is already under review and you will be refunded as soon as possible.

[19-Jun-19 10:25 PM] tomm#6375
