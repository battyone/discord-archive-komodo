@imindisbyee what?

[21-Aug-18 03:53 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, 
In `cli` (ubuntu)  how can I see if I'm running the etomic version or regular?

[21-Aug-18 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF Is your question related to BarterDex?

[21-Aug-18 04:10 AM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL  Hi, yes it is.

[21-Aug-18 04:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF you can check version in package.json file which you can find in folder with BarterDex.
If version is >= 1.0.1 etomic should be already included

[21-Aug-18 04:27 AM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL  Thank you! I'll check when I get back.

@TonyL I think I made a mistake.  It isn't BarterDEX.  It's `komodo-cli`.

[21-Aug-18 07:04 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF Did you run `komodod` before or you're using Agama in Native mode?
And could you please clarify what do you mean by etomic version of komodo-cli - maybe you meant electrum?

[21-Aug-18 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Etomic is an asset chain which using as an proxy token for ETH/ERC20 trading, so it's not very related to `komodo-cli` and `komodo-cli` don't have any specific etomic-version

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] CrisF#3405
@TonyL Hi, I managed to figure out the problem.
Coin daemons were running. 
I was getting a could not parse error when starting `./client`.
Couldn't remember what version I was running.  The `client` is slightly different for each version.
It turns out had an extra `space` in there that I was missing when checking through it.
All good now :)
Thanks for your help!

[21-Aug-18 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF Glad to hear that problem is resolved on your end!

[21-Aug-18 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
I think this version needs to disable the update part of  the `client` script, or it updates the regular non-etomic version and causes problems.

Hi!

After last updated libcurl3 on libcurl4, system (Kubuntu 18.04 bionic) deleted such applications as:
virtualbox-5.2
opera-stable
slack-desktop
mongodb

I really need these applications, I installed them with broken dependencies, but they are deleted after each update. Is...

[23-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Nabob#5004
you have some missing dependencies, in linux
https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/20086807/How+to+Install+Agama+Linux

@CMaurice

[23-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Nabob#5004
please follow document

[23-Aug-18 10:13 AM] CMaurice#1685
right:  "libcurl4 : Conflicts: libcurl3 but 7.60.0-1 is to be installed"

[23-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Nabob#5004
you need to uninstall libcurl4 and try to install libcurl3

[23-Aug-18 10:24 AM] CMaurice#1685
Genuine thanks Nabob,  but I believe this will break my system

[23-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Nabob#5004
in ubuntu, 18.04, we have this dependency,  for timebeing for any other connecting applications you can create soft link for libcurl.so.4.

[23-Aug-18 10:57 AM] CMaurice#1685
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.3

[23-Aug-18 10:58 AM] CMaurice#1685
also in the portable directory, also copied and renamed the lib there, nothing seems to work

[23-Aug-18 11:15 AM] CMaurice#1685
komodod.log is now just "komodod exited with code 1, crashed?"

[23-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Nabob#5004
may be that trick never works, you may need to keep libcurl3

[23-Aug-18 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
It's looks like a problem with double slash which was fixed few days ago but it's not merged to KomodoPlatform/komodo master branch yet as I can see.
@CMaurice If you're using KomodoPlatform/komodo  repo you may it build from `dev` branch
```
git reset --hard
git checkout dev
git pull
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```

[23-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Nabob#5004
@TonyL  He Is referring to Agama Linux Portable build, not  the cli build

üò≥ 

[23-Aug-18 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
only solution i found working is, installing the `libcurl3` package for this issue using `sudo apt-get install libcurl3`

[23-Aug-18 01:02 PM] CMaurice#1685
ok, so might try and build cli later, but prefer look of the Agama Portable

[23-Aug-18 01:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
the dev cli build failed, probably OOMed out on this not very suitable machine

[23-Aug-18 01:08 PM] CMaurice#1685
might be instructive line: komodo_utils.h:1401:29: error: ‚Äò%s‚Äô directive writing up to 8191 bytes into a region of size between 7680 and 8191 [-Werror=format-overflow=]

but out for a few hours now, thanks

[23-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Nabob#5004
@CMaurice  Komodo daemon itself needs 2GB of ram,

[23-Aug-18 07:49 PM] CMaurice#1685
apt-get remove --dry-run libcurl4 ... I just have to do without transmission for now, but guess there'll be something else in the near future. Komodo syncing:)

[25-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
do i have to deploy the VPS servers and access them through terminal before i can run the dependencies?

[25-Aug-18 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
You need seed node with public IP if you are planning on launching a real assetchain

[25-Aug-18 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
VPS is the best choice for that

[25-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369

you can run the commands listed to install KMD in macOS, the terminal will return whether it is installed, already  installed or upgraded

[25-Aug-18 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to run `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/var/homebrew` as the error message said how to fix it

[25-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369

[25-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
now onto dependencies

[25-Aug-18 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you need to install the dependencies one by one

[25-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
ok

[25-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
@SHossain can i install depenencies before deploying the 2 VPS ??

[25-Aug-18 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[25-Aug-18 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to install the deps in the VPS or computer where you want to compile and use

[25-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
ok

[25-Aug-18 01:58 PM] Shinzo Abe#9369
in practical terms that means running root@"vpsIP" right?

[25-Aug-18 01:59 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain what is so bad in using root@ setup

[25-Aug-18 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
**About Root**
The root user is the administrative user in a Linux environment that has very broad privileges. Because of the heightened privileges of the root account, you are actually discouraged from using it on a regular basis. This is because part of the power inherent with the root account is the ability to make very destructive changes, even by accident.
