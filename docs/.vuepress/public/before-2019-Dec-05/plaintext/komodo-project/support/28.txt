Hi, could someone please tell me how to find out how many `sigid`s a POS assetchain has?

[27-Aug-18 04:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF There is 64 `segids` https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/assetchain-params.html#ac-staked

[27-Aug-18 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Same amount as an amount of squares on chessboard ü§î

[27-Aug-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Same amount of notary nodes.... and the same amount of AC in each cluster in the scale test. Its just a good number üòÉ

Thanks @TonyL & @blackjok3r .  I wondering about using ` POSTEST64/createaddrs.sh` (https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/POSTEST64/blob/master/createaddrs.sh) for other POS assetchains like Verus.  Then my server crashed again after an update :/

[27-Aug-18 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Verus uses a diffrent PoS algo, there are no SegID's there

hi, I tried the new wallet on windows and my balance and transactions history are all missing

[29-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Nabob#5004
@PHBA2061  Please explain in detail, Wallet mode, Windows version ?

[29-Aug-18 02:43 PM] Nabob#5004
Provide screenshots if have any

[29-Aug-18 02:50 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Nabob  ok thank you, just found out why, it's silly but it's because I accidentally copied a leading space in my seed üòÇ

[29-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
Hi!! I just try to understand the rewardsystem every month of +0.417 % in bonus when you own more than 10 KMD. I store all my cryptocurrencies on a hardwallet (ledger nano s). Is the only way to transfer the KMD assets to an Agamawallet every month to claim reward and then reset and reinstall the ledger nano s with new BIP39 words every time though the private aren‚Äôt secure any more. Very problematic and  tediously to that every month!! Is it any other way to claim the reward? Suggestions appreciated!!! üòÅ

[29-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
*private keys aren‚Äôt secure

[29-Aug-18 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
If you want reward, use Agama wallet or Komodo CLI version. If you want security, use Ledger.

[29-Aug-18 03:52 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
Exactly what I do. But so tediously to have good security and at the same time want to claim the reward!!! I just bought some KMD yesterday...

[29-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
I always have all my cryptocurrencies on my ledger device.

[29-Aug-18 04:07 PM] SHossain#0007
Ledger doesn't support Komodo active user rewards.

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
Do you know if Trezor or Keepkey does?

[29-Aug-18 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
None of them does it

[29-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Kesoguy [Lv.40]#7341
Ok. Thank you for the answears!! I will never store KMD on a hot wallet. That‚Äôs just the way it is. To unsecure today!!! To many hackers out there robbing you!! Id I want the reward I need to do it the tedious way then..... üòâ

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to compile on VPS, what is the OS there?

[29-Aug-18 06:43 PM] Deleted User#0000

[29-Aug-18 07:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
hello?

[29-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Hermes#6934
You need the guide to compile Komodo ?

[29-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Hermes#6934
The most straightforward version will be the Linux version of the guide

[29-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Hermes#6934
you want to compile it for Windows @Deleted User ?

[29-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Hermes#6934
In this guide you will find the instructions to compile for Linux https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing/test-komodo-source-jl777-branch.html

[29-Aug-18 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User you need to compile the binary in the machine that you want to run. if you want to run them in VPS, you need to compile in your VPS. NOT in your macbook

[30-Aug-18 03:25 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
dude i have no idea what compiling is

[30-Aug-18 11:10 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
can someone help?

[30-Aug-18 11:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@Shinzo Abe Why do you need complied binaries? (if you don't know what compiling is you can use pre-compiled binaries release https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases) For which platform are you trying to compile? On which step are you stucked?

[30-Aug-18 11:14 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
dude i want to make asset chain

[30-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
and support literally lined me to this

[30-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-osx

[30-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
they said i have to install this before doing assett chain

[30-Aug-18 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Cool, so you're using MacOS and need binaries to start assetchain. Did you already execute all the commands from this guide?

[30-Aug-18 11:16 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
i created 2 droplets for vps servers in digital ocean and paid $40 for each

[30-Aug-18 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Which OS installed on these VPS?

[30-Aug-18 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I advice you install Ubuntu on these servers and just follow this guide https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Installing-Komodo-Manually#installing-komodo-on-ubuntudebian step by step, just copypaste all commands. (except the step with config creating - on this step you have to set safe password and change login)

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
dude i cannot istall ubuntu on these servers

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
they are already ubuntu

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
If you want to use your VPS servers as a node you don't need to compile it on your Mac. Just execute commands from guide above on both of yours VPS servers step by step

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
omg

[30-Aug-18 11:20 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369

https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-osx

[30-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
why they did say install this ?

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
@Shinzo Abe we don't take payment for supporting users

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
please don't offer any sort of payment

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
ok

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
sorry

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to login to your VPS using any terminal then execute the commands there

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
if you don't know how to login to your vps, please search on google or youtube

[30-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
how do i log in to both ?
