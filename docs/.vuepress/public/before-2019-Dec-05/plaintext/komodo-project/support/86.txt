Hi a few of my ERC20 tokens are getting stuck at verifying transaction when I am trying to send, I have tried to relog or send smaller transactions but it did not work.

[31-May-19 02:53 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
From agama desktop wallet

@TonyL Question:

https://www.atomicexplorer.com:9998/api/getbalance?port=10000&ip=electrum1.cipig.net&proto=tcp&address=KOMODO_ADDRESS does not work. This because of the fact that `blockchain.address.get_balance` is removed. https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-removed.html#blockchain.address.get_balance It should be replaced with ` blockchain.scripthash.get_balance`. You know this already of course. Is there something I can do to help? Can I update https://github.com/pbca26/electrum-proxy ?

So maybe atomcexplorer.com:9998 using not up-to-date version of code @bartwr

[31-May-19 11:14 AM] bartwr#6773
I think that's ^ the case. Do you know an other, trusted URL? Otherwise I'll run my own

[31-May-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
To be honest I'm not sure. Maybe @cipi can advise on this matter

[31-May-19 11:16 AM] bartwr#6773
Ok, thanks üòÉ

[31-May-19 11:36 AM] bartwr#6773
atomicexplorer:9998 is indeed using an old version of https://github.com/pbca26/electrum-proxy. I'm now installing an own version, to have full control.

Hi I am still having problems sending a few ERC20 tokens from agama to myetherwallet

[01-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I re installed the wallet

[01-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
It is stuck on NR 2 confirming if details are correct

[01-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Its happening on Kybernetwork and Chainlink

[01-Jun-19 12:26 AM] PTYX#6840
@Mr.Cryptodude did you have eth in the wallet?

[01-Jun-19 12:26 AM] PTYX#6840
You need eth to pay for fees

[01-Jun-19 12:27 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
yes ofc

[01-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Nikko92#0428
i have a question

[01-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Nikko92#0428
my mobile phone is dead and want to get my agama wallet with my kmd on my laptop

[01-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Nikko92#0428
the problem is that i already downloaded the agama wallet and restored it but the balance is still zero

[01-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Nikko92#0428
can anybody help me with that?

[01-Jun-19 02:11 PM] SHossain#0007
which desktop version you are using?

[01-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Nikko92#0428
i had an android wallet on my mobile phone and a desktop wallet on my laptop

[01-Jun-19 02:11 PM] SHossain#0007
which desktop version you are using?

[01-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Nikko92#0428
i have a agama desktop wallet (v0.3.6b-beta)

[01-Jun-19 02:14 PM] SHossain#0007
is your Proxy settings enabled? if yes, please disable it, save settings and restart Agama. check this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers

[01-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Nikko92#0428
it was already not enabled

[01-Jun-19 02:19 PM] SHossain#0007
what address do you see on Agama lite mode? please post the address

[01-Jun-19 02:19 PM] SHossain#0007
does the address match with the one you had funds in?

[01-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Nikko92#0428
a different adres than my adres where my funds are in

[01-Jun-19 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you have used wrong seed

[01-Jun-19 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
use the right seed, which will unlock your right address and you will be able to see your balance

[01-Jun-19 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
check this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027661-why-am-not-seeing-the-same-address-when-i-login-

[01-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Nikko92#0428
i filled in my seed without space

[01-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Nikko92#0428
maybe that was the problem?

[01-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Nikko92#0428
gonne try it again

[01-Jun-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you need to have the right spaces in between the words, if you had them originally

[01-Jun-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
if you remove a space, that changes the seed

[01-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Nikko92#0428
holy shit

[01-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Nikko92#0428
didnt know that and was thinking, if it says it is the right seed than it must be mine

[01-Jun-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
agama will accept any seed, words, numbers, string and will generate a corresponding address.

[01-Jun-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
same seed will always generate same address

[01-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Nikko92#0428
thank you very much!!!

[01-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Nikko92#0428

@bobo Komodo doesn't have testnet

[02-Jun-19 09:03 AM] SHossain#0007
(please ask same question in only in one channel)

[02-Jun-19 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
you can create any assetchain and test mining with `komodod`

[02-Jun-19 09:06 AM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=BOBO -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -testnode=1` will create an assetchain called BOBO with mining reward of 256 each block

[03-Jun-19 07:32 PM] taco#7800
So the new wallet will not let me log in it keeps telling me  pin decrypt error wrong key.
Can I restore the wallet again?

[03-Jun-19 07:57 PM] PTYX#6840
@taco which wallet?

[03-Jun-19 07:57 PM] taco#7800
3.6b  @PTYX

[03-Jun-19 08:31 PM] taco#7800
@ @SHossain

[03-Jun-19 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
you may be experiencing wallet file name error. please don't use space or any special symbol as wallet file name

[03-Jun-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007
use something like `mywallet` or `test1` or `wallet1`

[03-Jun-19 08:35 PM] taco#7800
@SHossain the wallet name is just letters no spaces

[03-Jun-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok. i understood differently

[03-Jun-19 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have backup of the seed phrase or WIF?

[03-Jun-19 08:36 PM] taco#7800
I have the seed

[03-Jun-19 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
use the restore wallet function again with the seed if you don't remember the password for the existing wallet file name

[03-Jun-19 08:38 PM] SHossain#0007
result will be similar
