[26-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
you would want to send the full balance of each to a single address

[26-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
then send it again to combine the UTXOs

[27-Feb-19 02:13 AM] CryptoCurb#3284
@Alright By "send it again" do you mean send the combined KMD to another address?

[27-Feb-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[27-Feb-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
or the same address

[27-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
basically once you combine the two, you will have multiple UTXOs sitting in the same address. If any of these UTXOs are <10 KMD, they won't accrue rewards

[27-Feb-19 05:49 AM] Cranky#9935
@Diesmaster  CRDS aren't showing up in BarterDEX after transferring. Has happened twice now.

[27-Feb-19 08:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Cranky  lite mode or native?

[27-Feb-19 08:10 AM] Cranky#9935
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Native. Credits doesn't have an electrum wallet.

[27-Feb-19 08:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I assume wallet is running and has 100% sync?

[27-Feb-19 08:13 AM] Cranky#9935
Yes and yes. Is there a backend wallet that BarterDEX uses for Credits at all? Only thing I can think of is that it's looking at the wrong chain after the v1.3.0 fork

[27-Feb-19 08:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
could be. Might be using wrong port for RCP...

[27-Feb-19 11:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
their readme at https://github.com/CRDS/Credits indicates RPC port is same as what is in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jl777/coins/master/coins

[27-Feb-19 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator is CRDS showing up in the coins manager?
Does it show under activate coins drop down menu?
is it active in BarterDEX GUI?

I guess someone from team can help troubleshoot.
@SHossain @cipi

[27-Feb-19 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Let a team member test the transaction of CRDS in BarterDEX GUI and help the user who's having issue.
that will help isolate any issues, better than assuming user's setup.

@Cranky did you send to the correct address (the one that is showing up in GUI)? What does explorer say? Is the tx on chain?

[27-Feb-19 08:30 PM] Cranky#9935
Under a different seed I had sent 3000 CRDS, none of which showed up. Created a new seed and sent 6 CRDS (3 x 2 CRDS) but no change

[27-Feb-19 08:40 PM] cipi#4502
and you are sure that BarterDEX can talk to the wallet?
wallet listens to the default rpc port and has rpcusername and rpcpassword set
this is my config that works
```server=1
txindex=1
litemode=1
listen=0
listenonion=0
rpcuser=bartercrds
rpcpassword=whatever```

[27-Feb-19 08:44 PM] Cranky#9935
There is no reason that it can't

[27-Feb-19 08:44 PM] Cranky#9935
it's on the same computer

[27-Feb-19 08:44 PM] cipi#4502
and  `netstat -ntlp | grep creditsd` is showing me
```tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:31050         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      29207/creditsd

[27-Feb-19 08:44 PM] Cranky#9935
running as the same user

[27-Feb-19 08:44 PM] cipi#4502
yes, but the wallet needs to listen to port 31050

[27-Feb-19 08:45 PM] cipi#4502
if it does not, BarterDEX can't connect to it and can't show balance

[27-Feb-19 08:46 PM] cipi#4502
if you don't have `server=1` in your config, then the wallet will not listen to the rpcport 31050, for example

[27-Feb-19 08:46 PM] Cranky#9935
ah, I'm missing server=1 I think

[27-Feb-19 08:46 PM] cipi#4502
or if the port is in use when you start the wallet, it will not bind to that port with the same result... best is to check if the creditsd is indeed listening to that port

[27-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Cranky#9935
I moved my BarterDEX from my PC to my VPS and likely forgot to add server=1. Adding now and restarting everything

[27-Feb-19 08:49 PM] Cranky#9935
Yes the balance is there now, sorry for wasting everyone's time 😐

[27-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Cranky#9935
The 3000 CRDS is also there under the other seed so all good. Will write up a quick guide for other Credits' users

bonus blocks do happen. I believe  its due to transactions which are made from wallets not claiming rewards, like exchange wallets

[05-Mar-19 04:05 PM] fredrik#2289
Hey guys I still have my coins lost on the ledger app since the update. Says reorg attack. Coins display as same value as before the update. And won’t sync with ledger.

[05-Mar-19 04:05 PM] fredrik#2289
Says block was not found a reorg may have occurred. Latest edition of ledger live update.

[05-Mar-19 04:06 PM] fredrik#2289
What a mess

[05-Mar-19 04:14 PM] fredrik#2289
I was told ledger was supported and at the time of update I should have to do nothing special.

[05-Mar-19 04:19 PM] PTYX#6840
@fredrik please give the support team a moment to look at the issue and see if this is something serious or just a Gui glitch

[05-Mar-19 04:19 PM] PTYX#6840
Can you take a look at the block explorer and see if your funds are in the address it previously was?

[05-Mar-19 04:36 PM] fredrik#2289
Hi. It seems to be the whole ledger device and not Komodo itself. Yes I will go and check. However the nano don’t seem to display the actual holding addresses just a new reicieve address each time.

[05-Mar-19 04:38 PM] fredrik#2289
Yes the Komodo coins are still in address. Puh. It’s a ledger issue alone. Sorry to bother you.

[05-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
New address each time means it uses a different seed for some reason?

[05-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No worries for asking, hope you regain access to your coins soon!

[05-Mar-19 04:39 PM] fredrik#2289
That must be the bitcoin. I checked the bitcoin address said 0. I almost got a heart attack.

So im reading up into Komodo. Turns out it does more than I initially thought. What do you guys think is the biggest thing kmd has going right now?

[06-Mar-19 06:14 PM] SHossain#0007

@Keppie I guess that's because the only general idea about Komodo to the Journalists is that Komodo is just "another privacy coin" 🤦

Blessing for programmers by programmers

[06-Mar-19 11:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder I think the greatest value we can gain is to hybridize value from different areas; I've seen this revolution in the game development industry - where non-programmers are pushing the stack towards intuitive tools, understandable resources that lead to easier adoption and seamless on-boarding and developers become more aware of a variety of needs creating more robust, elegant and flexible solutions. Together we are strong.

how long does a transaction normally take  from agama wallet to ledger?  Mine has been stuck on "processing transaction" for over 20 mins now. Its not even showing me a tx id. Is this normal?

[07-Mar-19 10:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
Doesn't sound normal. you can check the address on the block explorer to see if the balance has changed

I have got stuck funds in Barterdex at the moment, because the version I have is depreciated. My Hush address is the same in Electrum and Native modes, and I currently have Barterdex set to load Hush in Native mode, but the balance is still zero. Is there a correct way to access my funds in Barterdex. All I want to do is transfer them away and back into Agama. Thanks

[08-Mar-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
Your funds are tied up with your seed phrase or WIF key. just use the seed phrase to login into Agama and you will be able to access your funds in there.

[08-Mar-19 12:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
You can use Agama and access your fund with the same seed
