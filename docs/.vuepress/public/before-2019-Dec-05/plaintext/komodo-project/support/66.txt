morning, im trying to get some AXe coins on barterDex but having trouble adding the wallet, i been running lite mode . any suggestions, thanks

[05-Jan-19 09:17 PM] PTYX#6840
@DRC which GUI are you using?

[05-Jan-19 09:33 PM] Hermes#6934
I think AXE for some reason doesn¬¥t start the electrum server in Barterdex...you could try using  native in Barterdex and syncing your AXE wallet to see if it works

[05-Jan-19 10:56 PM] cipi#4502
there are no AXEelectrums in the coin database
this are all electrums: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums

yes. I tryed it. but it's a GUI. I just can use CLI

[10-Jan-19 01:12 AM] Hermes#6934
will try to test CENTOS for CLI haven't done it yet...it could be some difference in the dependecies

@Kyung-Nam Park  one question have you tried launching komodod from the directory from where you extracted the zipi file?

[10-Jan-19 02:03 AM] Hermes#6934
./komodod  -addnode=78.47.196.146 -daemon

I already did it. but It's didn't sync with error msg like this. 
stored orphan tx txid~!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (mapsz 101 prevsz 278)
mapOrphan overflow, removed 1 tx

[10-Jan-19 02:46 AM] Hermes#6934
so you are able to run the daemon but it doesn't load more blocks or after this error the daemon stops or crashes?

[10-Jan-19 02:49 AM] Hermes#6934
are you able to make calls like getinfo to see in which block you might be stuck ?

[10-Jan-19 02:53 AM] Hermes#6934
you might need to reconsider block or resync from scratch..I am currenty launching komodod in CentOS just to test it...will post you my result

[10-Jan-19 03:20 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723
It's a 1175783 blocks.

[10-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723
I hava a question. Have Komodo network a issue about hardfork? I want to know if this is a my daemon issue or network issue.

[10-Jan-19 03:27 AM] Hermes#6934
After the sapling update there has not been any issue or problem with the network

[10-Jan-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
@Kyung-Nam Park if you're daemon has stop syncing, please update to latest. There was a problem that caused some builds to stop accepting blocks

[10-Jan-19 05:11 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723
What version is the latest?

[10-Jan-19 05:13 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723

what is the minimum number of btc that I could trade?  now I have "order is too small. try again with a larger order"

[10-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Nabob#5004
It depends on seller orders and Utxos,  order matching happends automatically.

[10-Jan-19 01:51 PM] Antonina#2886
but what is the minimum? for example if there is no orders between btc and tusd and I want to create one. or if I want to buy minimum number of  komodo tokens with btc

[10-Jan-19 02:01 PM] Nabob#5004
there is no minimum amount trades specifically, You can place trade on barterdex, orders get picked for matching utxos. they are not much liquidity on those pairs.
We are working on marketmaker2 which we introducing Libtorrent DHT as networking layer for swap
