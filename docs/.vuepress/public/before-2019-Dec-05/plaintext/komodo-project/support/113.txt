how can i get my cryptounion coins out of my old adress? i also have some blocnation coins in there. are they lost now?

[05-Jun-19 04:54 PM] costa2439#3771
I saved almost all the funds in a new address created with agama v0.6.0 13-PBaaS, but "CHIPS" puts "invalid pub address" and "blocnation" "connection error". I have sent the form with the rest they put away

[05-Jun-19 04:54 PM] VE#4584
When i open my agama wallet:

Transcations history no aviable.

Unknow method,
Blockchain.address.get_balance

:(
Is usual this bug now?

[05-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There are no SPV servers to connect to @VE

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You‚Äôll have to go native

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
@VE import your seed in chameleon pay to send funds to a new safe address

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
you can use verus agama to generate a new safe address

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Number32#2621

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@spudboy999 start Verus agama with coin: VRSC in lite mode and create a new seed
use the old agama seed in chameleon pay to send to the new VRSC address you just created on desktop

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@Number32 you are using komodo native mode?

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Pwnz#4150
Thx @Deleted User

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Number32#2621
@gcharang yes but there is an exclamation point on the wallet

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] spudboy999#5256
@gcharang   Can I use the WIF in chameleon, I don't have my seed

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@spudboy999 yes

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] spudboy999#5256

[05-Jun-19 05:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Pwnz use chameleon pay to import seed and send funds to a safe address

[05-Jun-19 05:05 PM] Pwnz#4150
Thank you @mrlynch

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Number32#2621
@gcharang when i clock the exclamation point it pops a window saying Komodo is down

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Number32#2621

@Number32 I am finding the optimal solution for you just wait please

[05-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Pwnz#4150
My funds have been moved by the team I'm filling the form now. Just wanted to generate an address via mobile ü§ì

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@Pwnz don't use agama mobile

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
@gcharang he's using chameleon

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Pwnz#4150
Versus mobile I was trying

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Pwnz no

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Pwnz#4150
I'll use chameleon than üòá

[05-Jun-19 05:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you imported the agama seed in chameleon make sure you logout

[05-Jun-19 05:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
and create a new wallet with a new seed - please make sure you backup your new seed from chameleon

[05-Jun-19 05:08 PM] Pwnz#4150
Never used. Chameleon before. So I'll generate new addy

[05-Jun-19 05:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
also.. don't use chameleon to store ALL your life savings .. it is a mobile wallet after all

[05-Jun-19 05:10 PM] Pwnz#4150
Shout out to everyone that is handling this from the kmd team. Kudos on an best support and initiative to keep us safe.

[05-Jun-19 05:10 PM] Pwnz#4150
Good point @mrlynch

for native users:
download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
use KMD native mode there 
let the chain sync
create a new lite wallet in that same agama (save seed) for VRSC coin
note the R address
open native mode again and send all KMD balance to the address

if the verus agama doesn't work for native mode, look for the install instructions for komodo-ocean qt wallet at https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/folders/29000055193

quick steps to move your funds from agama lite wallet
1. import agama seed in chameleon pay or magnum wallet
2. download verus agama and create new seed - get address
3. send funds from bad agama to new safe address via chameleon or magnum

these seem to be the quickest ways atm
please see pinned messages for more details

@gcharang there is one problem though

[05-Jun-19 05:13 PM] StrangerHereMyself#7652
digged trough the support documentation and a good part of the channel history. some point is not clear to me. is a KMD private key that was created and exported from agama one year ago considered unsafe? it was imported and used in multiple recent agama versions (native mode only).

@Number32 whats the problem?

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] StrangerHereMyself#7652
@gcharang thanks, will move funds to new ocean wallet

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Number32#2621
@gcharang how will that veruscoin wallet detect my funds

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Hi

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Do we have to install Verus wallet over last version of Agama Wallet?

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] gcharang#6833
you have a wallet dat saved, any native mode will see the same funds

[05-Jun-19 05:16 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Please update instructions, also think they are confusing...

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flequillo1986 what part is confusing? it would help us to update

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] flequillo1986#5387
For example for all Agama Users, now there is no update of Agama in the official KMD website

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] flequillo1986#5387
You state to use Verus, but it is not clear if we should install it in parallel to our last Agama version or not

[05-Jun-19 05:19 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Private keys, not sure how I should use them when installing Verus in order to recover funds

[05-Jun-19 05:20 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Sorry, I read them 3 times and still not clear about the procedure to ensure a safe recovery

@flequillo1986 i am sure people will provide a helping hand. just don¬¥t do anything you are not 100% sure about. in doubt, ask.

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] StrangerHereMyself#7652
suppose more stuff will go there as some FAQ if needed to make the guide clearer

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] spudboy999#5256
@mrlynch   I used my  agama WIF key in chameleon pay to attempt to restore my KMD  from Agama wallet so I can send it to a safe address but it shows my balance is zero.  My KMD balance on dexstats is also zero,  so I guess my 3700+ KMD got stolen then?  Agama wallet 0.3.6 wont even load the transactions screen anymore so I can't see what happened to my funds

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] gcharang#6833
@spudboy999 check the address on explorer or dm me your address

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] üî•Xüî•#2583
damn I really needed those now to

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] üî•Xüî•#2583
anyone have 1 eth I can borrow? üòÉ

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
@spudboy999 your funds were most likely sweeped by sec team

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
check explorer

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flequillo1986 please check pinned posts with additional instructions and quick ways of moving funds.. if you have any questions please ask here... we're trying to help as many users as possible.. thanks for the input - faq's will be updated asap

[05-Jun-19 05:32 PM] costa2439#3771
install verus (agama 0.6.0). save seed and password. enter spv mode, save address R ... exit verus. enter verus old seed and send everything to a new address. finish

[05-Jun-19 05:36 PM] flequillo1986#5387
@mrlynch more than welcome, thanks for understanding and for your support here!

[05-Jun-19 05:41 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Hey, I really hate discord: I can‚Äôt find anything! Is there a consensus about where we should move our coins to?

[05-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Need wallet advice: ocean or versus? (Or something else?)

[05-Jun-19 05:45 PM] costa2439#3771
@Kay Gee verus was good for me

[05-Jun-19 05:46 PM] StrangerHereMyself#7652
ocean worked swiftly for me. maybe 30mins in total, using bootstrap

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Guys, I‚Äôve just entered agama to move my funds out

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Kay Gee#2313
And it won‚Äôt load

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Kay Gee do you have your seed?

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Yes

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] zaius333#5338
There seems to be an extreme gap of knowledge here

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Kay Gee#2313
And password

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Kay Gee import your seed in magnum or chameleon pay

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
use that to send your funds to a safe address generated in verus agama

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] mato121#5963
is there light version

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Is there a guide somewhere?

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] mato121#5963
?

[05-Jun-19 05:52 PM] mato121#5963
does claming rewards count as using agama

[05-Jun-19 05:52 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Okay, so I‚Äôm d/l agama from verus (0.56) and replacing the agama I had previously d/l from the kmd site.

[05-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Kay Gee#2313
Do I enter my seed from old agama into new agama?
