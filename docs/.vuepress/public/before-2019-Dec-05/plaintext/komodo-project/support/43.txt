make sure winblows has the latest version of javascript too.

[08-Oct-18 11:31 PM] Hermes#6934
it worked apparently with 2.42c but at the end the portable version and the installer version make the same config.json file so not quite sure if it could be something related to users javascript....there have been  mostly reported in Windows not on Mac

[08-Oct-18 11:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yea it's weird I've done several windows installs with this new version  no issues ,  just his comp for some reason.  I'll keep tinkering away at it one of these things should work

Hi I have a question

[09-Oct-18 06:14 PM] Vertigo#0439
How does Komodo tackle the energy spending problem of other pow algos?

[09-Oct-18 06:14 PM] Vertigo#0439
Or how it will in the future

[09-Oct-18 06:18 PM] Hermes#6934
Energy consumption you are referring , I think in some way with dpow we recycle Bitcoins power consumption ...not so sure about the pow Algo.

[09-Oct-18 06:18 PM] Vertigo#0439
Cool ty

[09-Oct-18 06:19 PM] Vertigo#0439
Just  researching kmd I hold Lisk but I'm tired of the dpos cartels

[09-Oct-18 06:30 PM] Vertigo#0439
Can I store DGB on my Agama wallet?

[09-Oct-18 06:33 PM] Hermes#6934
You can do this by enabling advanced features https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024423-activate-experimental-features/en  @Vertigo  After you enable advanced features and restart the wallet Digibyte should appear.

[10-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
so I'm trying to download the kmd chain for native mode. In agama wallet there is a red button that says "click to apply fix for slow windows download" or something like that. I clicked it. Now I can't see any progress bar for the download. Is it still working?

[10-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I think it's still working.

Hi. New Agama (242) in native mode doesn't show tx or balance after full sync. On cli all seems fine. what can I do to solve this?

[10-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Nabob#5004

[10-Oct-18 03:00 PM] barv#0867

i am trying to start barterdex. put in my passphrase and it has been loading for 5 minutes.

[10-Oct-18 10:53 PM] jasonabis#8549
Starting BarterDEX. Please wait.

[10-Oct-18 10:55 PM] Hermes#6934
Please take a look at this guide and let us know if this guide helps https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024459-barterdex-loading-issues/en

[10-Oct-18 10:55 PM] jasonabis#8549
okie doke

[10-Oct-18 11:02 PM] jasonabis#8549
so far, no go. i only deleted the cache folder though and relaunched.

[10-Oct-18 11:02 PM] jasonabis#8549
cannot find the user data folder.

[10-Oct-18 11:04 PM] jasonabis#8549
i've not successfully loaded it before.

[10-Oct-18 11:04 PM] Hermes#6934
You are using a 64 bit PC right? Which Os you have  and which Barterdex version you are using?

[10-Oct-18 11:06 PM] jasonabis#8549
yes. windows 8.1 and 1.1.2-rc

[10-Oct-18 11:09 PM] Hermes#6934
If you have never been able to launch it, then it could be related maybe to an AV not letting market maker to be launched. Can you go to the Task manager and see if when you launch Barterdex Marketmaker.exe is showed in the processes tab?

[10-Oct-18 11:13 PM] jasonabis#8549
it shows under apps and twice under background processes

[10-Oct-18 11:14 PM] Hermes#6934
Try killing the process close barterdex and relaunch it...it could be that you have already the process running in the background

[10-Oct-18 11:20 PM] jasonabis#8549
i ended all 3 tasks. as soon as i opened the app again, the two showed up under background and the one showed up under apps

[10-Oct-18 11:22 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok if you don't have any pending swap or stuck swap you can proceed on by erasing the Barterdex folder inside %appdata%/Roaming as it's showed in the past guide

[10-Oct-18 11:23 PM] Hermes#6934
after you do this try relaunching again and let us know if this helps

[10-Oct-18 11:24 PM] jasonabis#8549
i deleted that folder and relaunched. i didn't look at the past guide. is that all i needed to do?

[10-Oct-18 11:25 PM] jasonabis#8549
it will stay starting barterdex and show me those revolving circles forever. if i click reload under the view tab, it will let me put in or generate a new passphrase. but once i try to log in, revolving circles again.

[10-Oct-18 11:28 PM] Hermes#6934
This a little bit strange haven't seen this issue with the new version while launching it , just in case which coin are you wanting to trade? You can also try using Hyperdex it uses Barterdex same marketmaker but is more stable for new users...maybe you can find your trade there https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases Here is the link

I wasn't really looking to trade. MGNX got listed on barterdex and I just wanted to check it out.

[10-Oct-18 11:29 PM] jasonabis#8549
curious if it is trading much and if so, what price.

[10-Oct-18 11:30 PM] jasonabis#8549
should the net id be 0 and seed node ip be blank?

[10-Oct-18 11:49 PM] Hermes#6934
those configurations for your case don't need to be changed...can you please send us your PC specs and also a possible screenshot of the toggle developers tools options , and specifically into the Console and Network tab of those options at support@komodoplatform.com to see if there are any more errors,   You may see the orderbooks inside Barterdex live with this link if you would like to see if there are any MGNX orders ...here is the link  @jasonabis https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/books

guys am getting this message "error unable to get transaction history.. and it is waiting for sync while this message pops up. Welp!!!
Plus it is showing my previous balance not the updated balance. I have the latest agama installed

[11-Oct-18 06:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Catalyst ! Probably you have to wait till sync is finished

[11-Oct-18 06:37 AM] TonyL#3577
If it showing some of previous states of your balance it means that you're not on latest block

[11-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Catalyst#8405
but it doesn't sync it stayed like this for hours üò¶

[11-Oct-18 06:38 AM] Catalyst#8405
that's is why i ran the native mode for EQL.. I use lite mode for both KMD and EQL (same address of kmd)

[11-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Catalyst#8405
it did 100% sync and went to the latest block but when i relaunched as kmd lite and eql lite it was stuck on the old block address
