You can google stuff like this or hire someone (I'm about SSH). We're providing support only for Komodo products and always ready to help with questions around but not making Computer Science courses atm.

[30-Aug-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
you seem to be having issues. why do you want to try 2 at the same time when you can't complete one?

[30-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
i can complete one

[30-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
im jusdt thinking ahead

[30-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
do i do one by one?

[30-Aug-18 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
shh root@ipadresss1 then compile the code

[30-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
then shh root@ipaddress2 then compile the same code again?

[30-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369
could you please explain how these 2 VPS servers will be connected?

[30-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369

Then you have to follow this guide to create Assetchain for these 2 servers

[30-Aug-18 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Start chain on first VPS, connect to it from second one

what about this?  it says install the dependencies

[30-Aug-18 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a build stage. I guess you've already builded it.

Will ETOMIC be used for etomic swaps in  future?

[30-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Nabob#5004
etomic is already in use for swaps, for every btc coin to eth compatible coin swapping , marketmaker internally use etomic coins automagically @Seko

[30-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Seko#7408
Is it necessary to buy ETOMIC to use swaps or the Etomic coins comes automatically?

[30-Aug-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it is automatically received from faucet. mm2.0 will remove the need for it entirely

[30-Aug-18 03:29 PM] Seko#7408
What will happen then with the Etomic-Coins?

[30-Aug-18 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
ETOMIC doesn't have any real value apart from being used in barterDEX

[30-Aug-18 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
it is free coin

[30-Aug-18 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the only thing ETOMIC was ever sold for was BEER (I think)

[30-Aug-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. we did atomic swap with BEER

[30-Aug-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
BEER is also free üòÉ

@TonyL hey man, so do I have to build Komodo manually on my macbook before creating asset chain on top of digital ocean VPS  servers ?

[30-Aug-18 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User follow this guide https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/147292206/What+is+a+Z+Transaction

[30-Aug-18 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
@Shinzo Abe you need to build them inside VPS, not in your macbook
compile komodo https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html
create assetchains https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

[30-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Smedley#8094
Hey to build a DApp using crypto conditions I would need to create my own asset chain correct?

[30-Aug-18 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be the fastest way

[30-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Hermes#6934
it only completes till 97 %? until which block?

[30-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Hermes#6934
What Ubuntu version so that I can test it also?

@Bryan_Beus

[30-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no, the computer is running hot

[30-Aug-18 10:07 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus Please post a screenshot of `htop` screen from terminal

[30-Aug-18 10:07 PM] SHossain#0007
`sudo apt-get install htop`

[30-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I'm on the voicechat with mylo rn

[30-Aug-18 10:08 PM] SHossain#0007
that can give some details of what is happening

Sorry, I didn't have time to screenshot while it was running hot. Will have to take a shot another time. Thank you.

@jl777c do like BCH for the future?

[30-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
ive heard you dont like bitcoin core that much and that you side side with BCH. im curious as to why

[30-Aug-18 11:57 PM] Hermes#6934
Just in case there is a channel #ask-jl777

[30-Aug-18 11:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
In my views hodl both disregarding tech differences

[31-Aug-18 12:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But a more of #talk-trading talk it is

[31-Aug-18 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
recent BCH antics makes me reconsider its future

[31-Aug-18 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In regards to the bitmain ipo or more on the tech side of things?

[31-Aug-18 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
they talk of another fork

[31-Aug-18 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that is nonsensical, to split a weak coin into two. like NXT splitting into 3. will not be any good from it

[31-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, thanks for clarifying, will read up on that.

hi guys, i am updating my 2.41 beta wallet to 2.41d kmd wallet on windows.  do i want to choose "uninstall agama and  all of its modules"  click yes or no?

[31-Aug-18 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes. And don't delete any user data or wallet.dat
it is best to backup wallet.dat before any update.

[31-Aug-18 11:32 AM] sbucks#9217
i backed up my wallet as well as the whole appdata/komodo, probably over did it

nothing there other than genbet, genhodl,genjumblr, genrevs, and gensupernet,.. no exe file

[31-Aug-18 11:45 AM] sbucks#9217

hi all, what does the U and the S mean, when you check a transaction in the explorer. 

It's always split up. Sometimes U and U , sometimes U and S
