I think a way to prove the fact that you own your address might be, if you bought kmd from binance, you can show them the withdrawal address and see if that matches

[05-Jun-19 06:37 AM] JC#9171
Can we use ledger?

[05-Jun-19 06:37 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Jun-19 06:38 AM] JC#9171
What about other agama coins? Pirate ? Vrsc ? Etc

[05-Jun-19 06:39 AM] SVET5#3137
@SHossain  just for confirmation, I have another seed generated 2 years ago and have not been accessing it since then, is that address safe then? thanks

[05-Jun-19 06:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@JC PIRATE is not affected. but, if you use official agama lite mode for verus or any other coin, you might be affected

[05-Jun-19 06:41 AM] JC#9171
If we used native mode only?

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] SVET5#3137
from what I know Native modes are safe

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] pooler#1851
Dear Komodo team

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] JC#9171
Agama does not load.

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] pooler#1851
Would you clarify what is going on?

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] Zoroaster#5093
Agama is basically down

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
how the fuck you can sweep funds from someones address without their permission or seed? what the hell?

[05-Jun-19 06:42 AM] pooler#1851
Have I just lost 34000 KMD ?

[05-Jun-19 06:43 AM] pooler#1851
Is this serious? Can I kill myself now?

[05-Jun-19 06:43 AM] dxer666#8963
Connection error!

[05-Jun-19 06:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@pooler DM me your address

[05-Jun-19 06:43 AM] pooler#1851
I wake up today and my address is empty

[05-Jun-19 06:43 AM] pooler#1851
my private key is stored highly secure

[05-Jun-19 06:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
pooler, if the funds moved to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF they are safe

[05-Jun-19 06:45 AM] Warkid#2117
Its just for security @pooler  üòã

[05-Jun-19 06:45 AM] pooler#1851
omfg

[05-Jun-19 06:45 AM] pooler#1851
you're all killing me

[05-Jun-19 06:45 AM] Warkid#2117
The team took it away, its "safe"

[05-Jun-19 06:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
there was a vulnerability, the devs moved vulnerable coins theselves to protect

I mean would you rather they got stolen? Once you get them back make sure to say thank you üò¨

[05-Jun-19 06:46 AM] Warkid#2117
So if my coins are still there, they are not vulnerable?

[05-Jun-19 06:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
dxer666, thats a connection error

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] JC#9171
Guys if the funds are still in the address? Should we not do anything and wait?

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] tolken#2655
@Warkid don‚Äôt assume that. They are until they aren‚Äôt. Move them to safety.

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we dont know

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] JC#9171
I only used native mode

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] Alecandro#1179
Move them anyway

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] onebluesky#9439
if the funds are still in the address should move them

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] JC#9171
Agama does not load. How?

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] onebluesky#9439
what version

[05-Jun-19 06:47 AM] JC#9171
3.2

[05-Jun-19 06:48 AM] Alecandro#1179
The team has suggested you should move your coins if you basically touched your Agama wallet at all recently

[05-Jun-19 06:48 AM] onebluesky#9439
I had to use the 0.3.6 version

[05-Jun-19 06:48 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol that agama not loading error is the same one i had, which caused me to upgrade to the version that had the exploit üòõ

[05-Jun-19 06:48 AM] tolken#2655
@JC  if you have access to Chameleon wallet, I typed in my seed there to move my funds.

[05-Jun-19 06:48 AM] Warkid#2117
I would move, but I can't!

[05-Jun-19 06:49 AM] tolken#2655
@Warkid do you have access to Chameleon wallet on Android or IOS? Worked great for me.

[05-Jun-19 06:49 AM] mobipoi#5774

Just like how hacker can move your fund

[05-Jun-19 06:51 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the team moves the fund before the hacker can, as a precaution because some of you might be sleeping or working etc

[05-Jun-19 06:51 AM] onebluesky#9439
they probably exploited the same issue as a hacker would

[05-Jun-19 06:51 AM] D3b0#9761

thank you to mixic for posting on reddit, wasn't in here

[05-Jun-19 06:55 AM] Zoroaster#5093
Anyone here using Magnum wallet? And if so is it safe to import your Komodo funds into it?

[05-Jun-19 06:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Zoroaster  create a new address in magnum and send the funds to the new address in magnum

[05-Jun-19 06:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So far haven't heard anything about magnum is not safe

[05-Jun-19 06:59 AM] mobipoi#5774
Can one use old version agama to move funds?

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] mobipoi#5774
not sure web wallet is safu either

[05-Jun-19 07:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[05-Jun-19 07:04 AM] costa2439#3771
Can I send assets to a ledger address?

[05-Jun-19 07:07 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yes, if you haven't used your 24 seed words on Agama, in case you have used your Ledger's 24 seed words on Agama, then it's recommended to use another address

[05-Jun-19 07:08 AM] Umaru#8531
magnum wallet is better or chameleon?

[05-Jun-19 07:10 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it is recommended to use a new generated paper wallet, please check the pinned message

[05-Jun-19 07:11 AM] Umaru#8531
in paper wallet we cant claim reward

[05-Jun-19 07:12 AM] onebluesky#9439
I wouldn't worry about claiming rewards right now

[05-Jun-19 07:13 AM] Zoroaster#5093
I can‚Äôt even connect to Agama to get to my funds. Very frustrating

[05-Jun-19 07:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
that's right, you should prioritize securing 100% your funds, rather than worrying about the 5% per year üòÖ
