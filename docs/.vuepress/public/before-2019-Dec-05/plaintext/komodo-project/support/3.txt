When you did that swap, were you using BarterDEX or HyperDEX?

[23-Jun-18 03:55 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Actually did not try 2 or 4 because I'm afraid I am not smart enough

[23-Jun-18 03:55 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Hyperdex

[23-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
For HyperDEX this guide is better: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/319324201/My+swap+is+stuck+what+to+do+now

[23-Jun-18 03:56 AM] TomiDCat#6017
I was able to try that one with no luck

[23-Jun-18 03:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Did you try deleting the .finished files before performing the actions on that guide?

[23-Jun-18 03:56 AM] TomiDCat#6017
No

[23-Jun-18 03:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well, it's a step that should be in that guide.

[23-Jun-18 03:57 AM] Hermes#6934
Try this new guide instead

https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/377192449/Detailed+Guide+to+Unstuck+a+Stuck+Swap

[23-Jun-18 03:57 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok. I can try it

[23-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
First backup everything (copy to a safe place), then delete only the files which names end in `.finished`

[23-Jun-18 04:01 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Whats am I risking here? Should I move my funds off of barterdex before trying

[23-Jun-18 04:02 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Not worth screwing up anything over 12 dollars

[23-Jun-18 04:02 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Thanks Hermes I will read that and try

[23-Jun-18 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
@TomiDCat  not much risk if you backup your HyperDEX/BarterDEX system files.

[23-Jun-18 04:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as you have the swap files you cant lose anything.

[23-Jun-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you dont know what your doing save the folder from %APPDATA% (if windows, I expect your suing windows if you have a failed swap lol)

[23-Jun-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but as long as you do not delete anything but `.finished`  nothing bad can happen.

[23-Jun-18 04:23 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Thanks guys, Ill give it a shot in the morning and let you know. Too tired to mess around tonight

[23-Jun-18 04:23 AM] Hermes#6934
True that just keep your swap files and you will be fine

[23-Jun-18 06:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@TomiDCat We should have a better process to handle stuck or reclaim situations next week.

[23-Jun-18 12:09 PM] GEN#4697

[23-Jun-18 12:11 PM] GEN#4697
how can that be adapted

[23-Jun-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
submit a pull request to the jl777/coins repo

[23-Jun-18 02:11 PM] TomiDCat#6017
@Hermes @Deleted User  I was able to "unstuck" my swap using this guide https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/319324201/My+swap+is+stuck+what+to+do+now

[23-Jun-18 02:11 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Thanks!

[23-Jun-18 02:16 PM] TomiDCat#6017
It didn't work before because I was using the UUID from the wrong swap. The swap i mistakenly used was the one that is stuck in pending that I dont seem to be able to cancel

[23-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <nabob:matrix.org> @tomthomas:matrix.org: if you are on native mode, make sure you delete verus conf file also, deleting all files  in userdata except wallet.dat file.

[23-Jun-18 04:31 PM] TomiDCat#6017
"invalid param" when trying to withdraw from barterDEX?

[23-Jun-18 04:31 PM] TomiDCat#6017
or transaction did not complete try again

[23-Jun-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes agama is able to do withdraw when barterDEX has troubles

[23-Jun-18 04:35 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Is there a guide for withdrawing barterDEX funds through agama? I have only ever setup my KMD wallet on agama

[23-Jun-18 04:35 PM] TomiDCat#6017
or is there a way to access my BTC on barterDEX from hyperDEX? Thats really what I am trying to do

[23-Jun-18 04:35 PM] TomiDCat#6017
send from barterDEX to hyperDEX

[23-Jun-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
login with the same passphrase

[23-Jun-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you are always in control of your coins, so there is no need to withdraw them unless you actually want to move them to a different address

[23-Jun-18 04:47 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Ya I am still trying to wrap my head around it all thanks

[23-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Hermes#6934
Which coin you tried withdrawing KMD?

[23-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Hermes#6934
@TomiDCat

[23-Jun-18 07:14 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Bitcoin

[23-Jun-18 07:24 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok you should be able to manage your funds if there is an error with Barterdex using Agama as JL777 stated above you will only need to use the same seed as in barterdex in Agama and you should be able to manage your BTC

[23-Jun-18 07:25 PM] Hermes#6934
Also which version of Barterdex you were using 1.0.7 ?

[23-Jun-18 07:27 PM] TomiDCat#6017
1.0.7-rc it says

[23-Jun-18 07:27 PM] TomiDCat#6017
I will mess around in Agama and see if I can figure it out

[23-Jun-18 07:29 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah no worries just enter the seed in lite mode and you should be fine

[23-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Hermes#6934
Also you can try hyperdex if you want

[23-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Hermes#6934
Your seed has your private keys so by entering any of the programs you have access to your funds

[23-Jun-18 09:05 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok I was able to access the funds by logging into hyperDEX with my barterDEX seed that makes sense

[23-Jun-18 09:06 PM] TomiDCat#6017
but how does it work with Agama? When I log in what coin am I activating if I wanted to access my BTC

[23-Jun-18 09:12 PM] Hermes#6934
You can select BTC on electrum mode

[23-Jun-18 09:12 PM] TomiDCat#6017
BTC is not in the dropdown menu for me

[23-Jun-18 09:13 PM] Hermes#6934
You can go to settings then select appconfig and enable adavanced features then restart the wallet and you should see it

[23-Jun-18 09:18 PM] TomiDCat#6017
That worked thanks again Hermes

Are there electrum server issues?

[24-Jun-18 01:07 AM] yorklab#7270
@Hermes I think there are sever issues. Downloaded 2.39 but neither server seem to work in Lite mode.

[24-Jun-18 01:18 AM] PTYX#6840
@SHossain can you advise on the new wallet version?

[24-Jun-18 01:18 AM] PTYX#6840
There are quite a few complaints regarding the spv connection

REVS is syncing, but not KMD.

[24-Jun-18 01:40 AM] agnewpickens#7393
or at least shows my balance

[24-Jun-18 01:41 AM] agnewpickens#7393
JUMBLR too.  KMD won't sync still, have tried syncing my SUPERNET, that won't sync either.

[24-Jun-18 01:41 AM] agnewpickens#7393
There it goes, SUPERNET syncing, will see if I can get KMD to sync now.

My question about the TXID for ETH to BTC Swap still stands.   Anyone have this info or know where I can find it?

[24-Jun-18 06:07 AM] agnewpickens#7393
and now it doesn't after soft logout, and won't let me manually adjust socket timeout except 1 unit at a time

[24-Jun-18 06:09 AM] Nabob#5004
that param fixed in latest version v2.40, Its in testing phase, If You are good even without changes you need not to change Those settings
