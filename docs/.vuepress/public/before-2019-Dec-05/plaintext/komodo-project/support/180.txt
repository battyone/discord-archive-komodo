that's right backupwallet & dumpwallet is different üôÇ

[14-Oct-19 12:57 PM] house#8741
dumpwallet works with zaddr ?

[14-Oct-19 01:00 PM] Oszy#5734
I think it dumps every address in the wallet not just T

to manually do z there is 
`z_exportkey "zaddr"
z_exportwallet "filename"`

[14-Oct-19 01:00 PM] house#8741
ah, nice thank you

[14-Oct-19 01:01 PM] gcharang#6833
I just checked
dumpwallet doesn't seem to give zaddresses

[14-Oct-19 01:01 PM] house#8741
am trying z_exportwallet with -exportdir added

[14-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Oszy#5734
really? then there is no z-equivalent of dump? i swear zecwallet has a dump option it may be only going trough z_addresses one by one then with z_exportkey

[14-Oct-19 01:04 PM] gcharang#6833
z_exportwallet should give both R and z addresses

[14-Oct-19 01:05 PM] Oszy#5734
ok so export gives a readable file as well not just a copy of wallet.dat

[14-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Oszy#5734
bit confusing why the 2 different commands then üòÑ

[14-Oct-19 01:07 PM] gcharang#6833
dumpwallet came from btc
instead of modifying its behaviour, zcash added z_exportwallet

backupwallet is just copy pasting wallet.dat, same for BTC and zcash

[14-Oct-19 01:07 PM] Oszy#5734
so z_export  = t_dump

[14-Oct-19 01:08 PM] gcharang#6833
yes
z_export  = t_dump + z_dump

[14-Oct-19 01:09 PM] Oszy#5734
ok great, now we all learned üòÑ

Hello, I  need to restore my wallet after the hack a few weeks ago. Do I have to install Verus Agama Wallet or OceanQT Wallet?

[15-Oct-19 05:00 PM] gcharang#6833
@marv101 do you use lite mode normally? if so, the Verus Agama wallet

[15-Oct-19 05:12 PM] marv101#8481
I did yes. Thanks for your fast replay. I'l do it now

Me again. How can I restore a wallet? I can only choose to sign in or create a new one

[15-Oct-19 05:43 PM] marv101#8481
... or add a coin

[15-Oct-19 06:05 PM] marv101#8481
The problem I intent to solve by restoring my wallet is: I did sent my KMD to another address (due to the hack-news) of mine, however, it never arrived. Yet I can See them on KMD explorer on my address, while I cant see them on my - old - wallet.

[15-Oct-19 06:06 PM] marv101#8481
I would muchh appreciat if someone guide me through this until I got my coins save and sound ü§ó

[15-Oct-19 06:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
old wallet lite mode might not have latest electrum servers.

[15-Oct-19 06:43 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
log in to new wallet with the address seed /wif

[15-Oct-19 07:58 PM] marv101#8481
Done, Thank you! üôÇ

can't get  the g++-multilib to install on raspbian (debian linux) on a pi_1. see conversation here http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=134930

[16-Oct-19 07:13 AM] Lumbi#8378
I guess my question is, do I need the full g++-multilib to run KMD or  is there a work around?

[16-Oct-19 07:14 AM] gcharang#6833
@Lumbi you'll have better luck in the #dev-general channel
I don't think many people run KMD nodes on rasp pi
radix or siu might know

[16-Oct-19 07:15 AM] Lumbi#8378

Agama 0.5.9-1, i withdrew from exchange ARRR coin. backed up wallet. then withdrew again. didn't backup after that. 
In Agama i see the first address with balance. I do not see second address. However, when i generate a new address, it generates the same address i used for the second withdrawal.

Now how can i rescan blockchain so that it updates the balance in that address?

Before i close the wallet, i worry i won't be able to generate the same address again. Is there a way to get the private key for an existing address? I think i saw it when i generated it, but i closed that tab and am unable to access it. I followed the instructions here but they only tell me what i already know (the priv key shown the moment it's generated)

[18-Oct-19 04:51 PM] 1112#1679
for ARRR coin, i can only generate private address. I tried it just now and in fact i was wrong, i am never shown the private key.
And when i go to settings and try to get the wallet keys, it shows the WIF assocaited with transparent addresses. And i don't know how to identify the transparent address that goes to my private address...

[18-Oct-19 04:52 PM] 1112#1679
But i have an idea. If i send a new transaction from my existing address 1 to the address 2 that isn't updated,  maybe that can update it?

[18-Oct-19 04:55 PM] 1112#1679
I've found the answer to finding the private key. hit the "i" info button next to the address. thanks.

With the private key i was able to import and rescan and it all worked. I was very worried, but it's good, because i won't rely only on wallet. dat anymore and always backup my private keys now. Thank you.

hi guys, I have the same issue as Abdullah Ka. I tried to migrate my THC wallet to Komodo and I get './komodod: No such file or directory'. This is done on a new iMac on OS Mojave. Do you have any idea what to do to make the Komododo folder is found? I am not an expert but would appreciate your guidance

[19-Oct-19 05:07 AM] gcharang#6833

[19-Oct-19 05:18 AM] Matty4000#0910
Sure thing. I get: /Users/matt/komodo/src

[19-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Matty4000#0910
And that is indeed where the folder and files are.

[19-Oct-19 05:19 AM] gcharang#6833
ok
```
ls | grep "komodod"
```
is there any output?

[19-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Matty4000#0910
Yes. I get "komodod-bitcoind.o"

[19-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Matty4000#0910
From what I read before, Step 31 is trying to look up a folder under 'Application Support' instead of the Komodo folder which is in my Home directory (akak /matt above)

[19-Oct-19 05:38 AM] gcharang#6833
looking up  'Application Support' is for step 19
these instructions in the google doc are for Ubuntu/Linux

in your case specifically, the build step didn't complete
you can ask for prebuilt binaries from the THC discord
I am not sure which specific branch/commit works for THC

[19-Oct-19 05:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@Matty4000 ^
