Hi I am running agama wallet 3.6b in native mode and trying to have ZEXO work for me.
1. I have both ZEX and ZEXO in my agama wallet fully synced.
2. I used import WIF key (private key) in ZEXO wallet
3. I can now see the ZEX address in my ZEXO wallet.
4. I have done a rescan of the wallet.

The problem is that ZEXO wallet is not showing any balance. Correct balance is being shown when I switch over to my old ZEX wallet.
I have tried to close down the agama wallet and restart it without any success.

Any suggest how to solve this issue?

[28-May-19 02:37 AM] Alright#0419
@cabera check the ZEXO explorer, does the address have a balance?

Yes

[28-May-19 04:01 AM] cabera#9759
Explorer shows that the correct balance

[28-May-19 04:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
Can you start agama with a rescan on ZEXO
If the correct key is imported it will show up

[28-May-19 04:43 AM] cabera#9759
@CHMEX what is the CLI command to do a rescan?

[28-May-19 04:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
You need to start the daemon with argument
-rescan

[28-May-19 04:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe if you use agama at  startup there are daemon parameters to select from
Use reindex

[28-May-19 06:44 AM] sedatebeast#9813

ok im on mobile and will try the update, thank you

[28-May-19 07:04 AM] sedatebeast#9813
do i have to uninstal first?

[28-May-19 07:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Not necessary to uninstall, you can just find `Agama` in Play store and it will have `Update` button in description if you have it installed already

[28-May-19 07:07 AM] sedatebeast#9813
ok, there is no button to update 😦

Hey does anyone know why the new android agama update isn't loading just hangs at the purple screen after logo

[28-May-19 08:46 AM] Exxplosive#7274
Do we need to let it load for a while

[28-May-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi! Are you expecting such issue after latest update?

[28-May-19 08:52 AM] Exxplosive#7274
Yes since new update

[28-May-19 08:53 AM] Exxplosive#7274
Was working before

[28-May-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Please try to do the following: 
1) Ensure that you control seed on which you have funds. You can doublecheck / record it by `Settings -> Recovery` option. Before next steps ensure that seed which you wrote on paper exactly match entry which showing `Recovery` feature
2) In `Settings` select `Purge all data -> click Save` (please note that only way to access your funds after it is correct seed input), uninstall app and install again, login with seed saved on step1

[28-May-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, you can't perform step1 now actually if it not login, sorry

[28-May-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you have seed saved? If not: please email to support@komodoplatform.com for futher assistaince

[28-May-19 09:19 AM] Exxplosive#7274
@TonyL I can't even get into the settings bit on Android I'll try to uninstall and reinstall I have the seed recovery saved anyway.   Luckily I had transferred my KMD to exchange but wanted to send back to stake.

[28-May-19 09:20 AM] Exxplosive#7274
So was gonna do a test send first

[28-May-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Looks like it have problems on specific devices on update from some of old versions to latests. It not reproducable on our side yet.
Yep, uninstall/install might help 👍

[28-May-19 09:25 AM] Exxplosive#7274
Okay have cleared app data in android settings, and does show the create restore wallet page now.

[28-May-19 09:25 AM] Exxplosive#7274

One more question agama doesn't support viacoin does it?

[28-May-19 09:27 AM] Exxplosive#7274
I sent some funds to a viacoin address in the android agama wallet and it keeps coming with server issues from when I can remember

[28-May-19 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems that their electrum servers not availiable at the moment. As soon as servers from this list https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/VIA will be availiable it should work. You may contact their team to ask check electrums

I need help with my wallet ! Coins have disappeared

[28-May-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@REKT Queen Do you use mobile or desktop Agama?

[28-May-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
There were important updates for both platforms last days, please ensure that you're on latest version. If update to latest version will not resolve your issue: feel free to open support ticket by email to support@komodoplatform.com

[28-May-19 11:01 AM] REKT Queen#6380
Ok thanks

[28-May-19 11:02 AM] Exxplosive#7274
@REKT Queen do you have the android agama wallet?

[28-May-19 11:02 AM] REKT Queen#6380
I have desktop wallet

[28-May-19 11:02 AM] Exxplosive#7274
Ah okay, I can't advise on that sorry

[28-May-19 11:03 AM] REKT Queen#6380
I will try update again and see what happens 😬 then take a ticket if all else fails I guess

[28-May-19 11:46 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
When installing the latest version the uninstall option is ticked by default. Should we uninstall first? or can we just select the re-install option. Secondly how to delete a wallet in Agama?

[28-May-19 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
it is always better to uninstall old version first before installing new version.

[28-May-19 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
`Secondly how to delete a wallet in Agama?`
how did you use Agama before? Native mode or Lite mode?
do you have backup of seed or wallet.dat ?

[28-May-19 11:49 AM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Except I have to rebuild/import a wallet that previously was setup and working. Lite mode... I have backups etc. Being confused I set up a new wallet by mistake and want it gone from the menu.

[28-May-19 11:52 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have a backup of your seed, you don't need to delete anything apart from uninstalling old version and installing new version. once done, use the Restore wallet option and the seed you had as backup.

[28-May-19 11:53 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want to delete an unwanted wallet file, Go to settings > Change PIN and delete the pin file

[28-May-19 12:10 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
It's the Wallet Name request and PIN request thats confusing me... is that for old stored info? Or am I creating it anew?

[28-May-19 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
if you already have a seed that you want to use, select Restore wallet.

[28-May-19 12:13 PM] SHossain#0007
for easily identification give a wallet file name and use a PIN/password to login

[28-May-19 12:13 PM] SHossain#0007
so, you dont' have to type your seed or WIF every time you want to use it.

[28-May-19 12:14 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
If I reinstall without uninstalling does the old wallet and PIN remain?

[28-May-19 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[28-May-19 12:14 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Cheers. All good now!

[28-May-19 08:05 PM] Steelrat#2421
Hello, I can not see my funds in the Agama Wallet (0.3.6b) , can see it on the chain though, so it is not gone 😄 , the wallet is saying: "unknown method blockchain adress get_balance" , changing server does no good, also socket timeout is now at 200.000 and does not work either, what else can I do?

[28-May-19 08:05 PM] Steelrat#2421
thank you in advance

[28-May-19 08:49 PM] SHossain#0007
check if you have proxy enabled in settings. if enabled, disable it and restart Agama

[28-May-19 09:20 PM] Steelrat#2421
@SHossain  there it is, thank you...

[29-May-19 07:13 PM] Ricishort#4976
Hey there,
I installed the new Version of the Agama Desktop Wallet today. I used my normal seed wich i always used but this time it led to an Komodo adresse with zero Balance and no Transaction History. I confirmed the shown adress as i wanted to see if its really empty and it was. I also tried to Install the older Version again but that didn't show any balance either and was offline. I would appreciate any help. (Version 0.3.6b)

[29-May-19 07:20 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have proxy enabled in the settings? @Ricishort

[29-May-19 07:58 PM] Ricishort#4976

[30-May-19 06:48 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 06:48 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 06:48 AM] Tek#5253
import seed

[30-May-19 06:48 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 06:49 AM] Tek#5253
