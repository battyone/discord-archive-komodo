after users had a chance to secure their funds

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] private guy#0631
I’ve sent my SuperNET & Komodo to Coinexchange until situation is fixed (not my key, not my coin) how long until a possible fix?

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
are users really being asked to move funds to centralized exchanges?

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] private guy#0631
No

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] private guy#0631
paper wallet better

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`after users had a chance to secure their funds`
And how do we know what funds to secure if we can't get a straight answer as to how far back to go? We just guess and hope?

native wallet or exchanges, whatever is most convenient although the latter is silly

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
i've moved my KMD to KomodoOcean

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
centralized is the last option of choices, but most 'convenient'

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
again, why is pbca blocked from private channels and there is no communication with him?

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] zaius333#5338
I guess we wont be collecting staking rewards for a while

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
As far as I remember, the KMD web wallet is not recommended for amounts over 10KMD, is that correct?

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
web wallet is agama lite

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`again, why is pbca blocked from private channels and there is no communication with him?`
because he's the one that feked up?

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
`And how do we know what funds to secure if we can't get a straight answer as to how far back to go? We just guess and hope?`
it was said last 2, 3, 4 months - assume last 4 months... u have seed, u used in agama lite in last 4 months -> move funds

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
can collect verus staking coins 😃

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why is web wallet being recommended if its exactly the same code... in some cases much more out dated that latest release

[05-Jun-19 03:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
if in doubt go balls deep

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
who recommend web wallet ?

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] zaius333#5338
Only use web wallet to send coins out

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
`because he's the one that feked up?`
How i can know that if there are no answrs

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why is web wallet being recommended if its exactly the same code`

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
to move funds, if you cant use agama, use webwallet. don ont store in web wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and if there are no answers why is he being blocked?

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] zaius333#5338
Put it in your ledger tbh

[05-Jun-19 03:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
you're not helping

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@siu - Chainmakers  pls ask in #ask-a-question let this channel be for helping people move funds

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think this is not helping at all...

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] optickle#9937
Verus wallet is failing on creating lite wallet, "Go to "Settings", select "SPV Server List" tab, choose new server and click "OK"."  and this step is failing

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
he's part of the community and he's looking for support

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] DLT Novice#2835
Why not just use the Wallet, what makes it unsafe

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] 차미숙#8912
Web wallet is awesome

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
priority is to help people move funds. Answers will be available once they have had a chance to do so.

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] 차미숙#8912
Never used it until just now

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@DLT Novice all we are told is now is not the time to tell us that

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤷🏽

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] bishop#9773
How much notice are people given outside of discord, for instance, bcttalk, twitter, reddit?

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @siu - Chainmakers please let us help users for now. and please ask anything you want to know later

[05-Jun-19 03:09 AM] SHossain#0007
that is important

[05-Jun-19 03:09 AM] optickle#9937

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the best way to move funds is using the latest agama release

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Mark81#4505
Chameleon pay is safe?

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im sure it is

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wallets using old code will not work with latest electrumx release

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

only release of agama that is know to work 100% with latest electrumx methods is the latest.

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] Jcharming#2693
@SHossain Does this security alert effect users that used the "restore wallet" feature when updating to  0.3.6b-beta?

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] mrlynch#5735
i've used chameleon to import a seed from agama lite and sent to native wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@Jcharming ^^

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only release of agama that is know to work 100% with latest electrumx methods is the latest.`
You mean the one that was deleted earlier today?

[05-Jun-19 03:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh... LOL

[05-Jun-19 03:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[05-Jun-19 03:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is crazy

[05-Jun-19 03:16 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
I want answers now as well, but I’m sure the team is making sure they know the full scope of the issue before making any statements that could backfire on them. They obviously will also need time to put together a well worded explanation to try to minimize damage/panic. Thats probably why this has only been disclosed in discord and not anywhere else. Good luck everyone, be safe and move your funds if necessary

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is there even a report of stolen funds?

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] Petrus#8039

@siu - Chainmakers now's not the time to know that

[05-Jun-19 03:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not that I am aware of, but precautions are prudent. Better safe than sorry

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] zaius333#5338
I used the web wallet and sent my funds out

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] optickle#9937
I use agama windows portable 0.3.6b in native mode but when I enter my address on KMD explorer I see a strange mining event and the balance is 3KMD

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this announcement is anything but prudent

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] shaun98#1976
Hey, I have ZEX in agama wallet which isn't supported yet after the ZEX fork, so how do I import those out?

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] Dave123#3592
@SHossain  How can i send the Supernet assets? Web wallet does not support supernet

[05-Jun-19 03:24 AM] optickle#9937
I don't want to enter my seed key into agama yet.  Can anyone help?

ASAP

[05-Jun-19 03:33 AM] Jcharming#2693
@SHossain I am unfamiliar with verus wallet and feel uncomfortable quickly using it.  I'll likely send my coins to binance, can I safely access my desktop Agama wallet to send, or must I use the agama webwallet?

[05-Jun-19 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 months ago, maybe 3, maybe 4?

[05-Jun-19 03:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Send by whatever method works for you

[05-Jun-19 03:34 AM] SHossain#0007
@Jcharming use any method

[05-Jun-19 03:35 AM] Jcharming#2693
Thank you, so just to clarify using the desktop Agama to move them out of my address won't put them at risk or something crazy?

[05-Jun-19 03:36 AM] zaius333#5338
Is there going to be an update to agama wallet in the future?

[05-Jun-19 03:36 AM] Jcharming#2693
Not trying to be hasty and do something irreversible, just not familiar with verus wallet, or any version of agama that isn't the desktop lite version

[05-Jun-19 03:37 AM] SHossain#0007
Verus Agama is a fork of our Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:37 AM] SHossain#0007
same experience

[05-Jun-19 03:37 AM] SHossain#0007
webwallet is also same

[05-Jun-19 03:37 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
@Jcharming no risk but never use that seed again. That is what we know as of right now. Right now seems ppl have issues with desktop but have had success using web wallet to transfer coins out

How to use agama 5.6a when both spv servers are down?

[05-Jun-19 03:37 AM] 27aume#8635
I just saw the sec alert msg. I'm installing komodoOcean on my linux machine at the moment. so we have to move all our coin to new wallet.dat files?

[05-Jun-19 03:38 AM] SHossain#0007
@DLT Novice check my pinned post

[05-Jun-19 03:39 AM] SHossain#0007
@27aume native mode is not affected. unless you used the privatekey of your native wallet to login into Agama lite mode

[05-Jun-19 03:40 AM] 27aume#8635
Ok Thank you. So I only need to move funds laying in my old bartedex account or these ones are also safe?

[05-Jun-19 03:41 AM] Jcharming#2693
@ResoluteCrypto Thank you

[05-Jun-19 03:42 AM] zaius333#5338
Will there be a permanent solution to this?

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
The announcement said they will be providing an alternative wallet very soon. Sounds like they are working on fixing whatever issue they discovered
