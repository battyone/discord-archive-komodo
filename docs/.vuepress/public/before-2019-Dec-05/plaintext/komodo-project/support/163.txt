@otherego that should be the problem

[16-Jul-19 07:12 AM] otherego#4422
ok

[16-Jul-19 07:12 AM] otherego#4422
because is beta branch

[16-Jul-19 07:12 AM] otherego#4422
?

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] otherego#4422
i have not clue how to compile on windows

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] otherego#4422
i just use linux as main desktop

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] otherego#4422
but a lot of people are stuck on win

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL 
can you provide binaries for 
jl777/komodo repo 
beta branch 
for windows?

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, sure

[16-Jul-19 07:13 AM] TonyL#3577
let me trigger the build

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] gcharang#6833
@otherego the repo is wrong too
for THC, the upstream repo of the one you posted is needed

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] otherego#4422
guys you very kind

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] otherego#4422
instructions says

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] otherego#4422
to git checkout beta branch

[16-Jul-19 07:15 AM] otherego#4422
i'm not a dev sorry

[16-Jul-19 07:15 AM] otherego#4422
but i'm learning fast

[16-Jul-19 07:16 AM] gcharang#6833
no problem @otherego the instructions are wrong for windows

the instructions in the docs are for the most general case, but for THC,  they change a bit

[16-Jul-19 07:17 AM] otherego#4422
i imagine that.. also something wired in linux instuctions because i modified THC.conf file and not komodo.conf one

[16-Jul-19 07:17 AM] otherego#4422
(if i did well)

[16-Jul-19 07:17 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah, that too
komodo.conf for the KMD chain
THC.conf for the THC chain

[16-Jul-19 07:18 AM] otherego#4422
exactly

[16-Jul-19 07:19 AM] otherego#4422
i told to thc admin. but he is pretty busy in those fork

[16-Jul-19 07:19 AM] gcharang#6833
anyway, why did you have to change the THC.conf file?

anyone else get the sync error using ledger ? Edit - I see it's being looked at by them. Block Rewards still works though 😃

[16-Jul-19 08:10 AM] otherego#4422

[16-Jul-19 08:16 AM] otherego#4422
thank you @gcharang and @TonyL

{Reactions}
🎉 

[16-Jul-19 08:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@Exile13 can you get the instructions updated?
use these binaries in windows: http://159.69.45.70/tonyl_windows_beta.zip
reupload them in your github or some  other server used for your website as this is a test server

[16-Jul-19 08:16 AM] otherego#4422
nothing was wrong except instructions

[16-Jul-19 08:16 AM] otherego#4422
ahahhahaha

[16-Jul-19 08:17 AM] TonyL#3577
I dont think that it's good idea to use my test server in some guides/etc @gcharang

👍 (2) 

[16-Jul-19 08:17 AM] otherego#4422
ok i will not share that

[16-Jul-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
@Exile13 can download these binaries and host somewhere statically, then share the link in instructions

[16-Jul-19 08:18 AM] otherego#4422
yes

[16-Jul-19 08:18 AM] otherego#4422
i will tell him

@otherego is the any errors printed in the stdout?

it's rejecting the first block the payments CC was used, seems an indication that `earlytxid` isn't being set properly somehow

Hi all, I moved my KMD from Agama to my Ledger Nano S after the hack (right in time, I think).  But when I try to access that account I get a synchronisation error (API HTTP 503). Is this a ledger issue or might there be a connection to the hack? Thanks for your help!

[16-Jul-19 09:59 AM] Farullalla Fashuk#6832
(In the KMD explorer I can see the tx being successful, funds are still on the address provided by the ledger nano)

[16-Jul-19 10:21 AM] Alright#0419
@Farullalla Fashuk it's a problem with ledger's backend servers, no relation to the hack
