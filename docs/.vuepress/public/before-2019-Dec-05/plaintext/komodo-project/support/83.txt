I have a rather stupid question, but how would one create a token on Komodo?
For example, if I want to make a token on ethereum, I'd just write a smart contract.
What is the equivalent of that in komodo?

But isn't an asset chain a separate (side) chain? Is it not possible to issue tokens on the main chain?

ok. DMing

[20-May-19 05:25 AM] krtk6160#3131
@gcharang Thank you. I tried that guide, but I have one issue. In the guide, it says that running `getinfo` on either of the daemons should report `connection: 1`. But in my case, both return 2. What does this mean?

[20-May-19 05:27 AM] krtk6160#3131
Also, even though I added a line that specified  `port=SOME_PORT_NUMBER`,  both the daemons show the same port number when run.

[20-May-19 05:27 AM] krtk6160#3131
I've tried with different port numbers also. Rpc port number is different for both, but not p2p port number.

[20-May-19 05:34 AM] gcharang#6833
those are all fine @krtk6160 
```
either of the daemons should report connection: 1. But in my case, both return 1
```
"both return 1" is what I meant will clarify in the docs

```
both the daemons show the same port number when run. 
```
if it's in the daemon output, that is the standard numbers based on the params supplied and can be ignored. The only important rthing is are the rpc commands working on the rpc ports that you have specified and the daemon able to connect to other nodes with the p2pport (just "port") that you have specified

[20-May-19 05:35 AM] krtk6160#3131
@gcharang I'm sorry, I made a typo. What is happening is that both return 2.

[20-May-19 05:35 AM] krtk6160#3131
The docs were clear, don't worry about that üòÑ

[20-May-19 05:36 AM] gcharang#6833
do you have the same assetchain running in a different system?

[20-May-19 05:36 AM] krtk6160#3131
No, I only have 1 machine, my personal laptop

[20-May-19 05:36 AM] gcharang#6833
same assetchain == same parameters

[20-May-19 05:37 AM] gcharang#6833
let me start a chain and check

[20-May-19 05:37 AM] krtk6160#3131
Okay

[20-May-19 05:38 AM] krtk6160#3131
Also, when I run `getwalletinfo`, it returns `{
  "": 777777.05244666
}`

[20-May-19 05:39 AM] krtk6160#3131
So I don't know which account has that balance.

[20-May-19 05:39 AM] gcharang#6833
`""` is some deprecated account related stuff
there are no accounts right now
only addresses
you can do listunspent to see which address the balance is in

[20-May-19 05:40 AM] gcharang#6833
you can use getbalance for the total wallet balance

[20-May-19 05:41 AM] gcharang#6833
```
{
  "walletversion": 60000,
  "balance": 10.01334496,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.0,
  "immature_balance": 0.0001,
  "txcount": 106,
  "keypoololdest": 1536889653,
  "keypoolsize": 101,
  "paytxfee": 0.0
}
```
should be the result of  getwalletinfo
did you just get 
```
{
  "": 777777.05244666
}
```

[20-May-19 05:41 AM] gcharang#6833
?

[20-May-19 05:43 AM] krtk6160#3131
No, I got that for `listaccounts`

[20-May-19 05:43 AM] krtk6160#3131
I'm getting the output of getwalletinfo just like you mentioned

[20-May-19 05:45 AM] krtk6160#3131
listunspent returns a long list of txns with a lot of different addresses. Is it not possible to initialize an assetchain that assigns all the premined coins to 1 particular address?

[20-May-19 05:50 AM] gcharang#6833
yes you can do that with  `-pubkey` option in one of the nodes
do it like this:  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/custom-consensus-instructions.html#creating-and-launching-with-a-pubkey

[20-May-19 05:51 AM] gcharang#6833
make sure you `dumpprivkey` for the pubkey and save it
and mine the first block on the node that has the `-pubkey` in the daemon launch command
-pubkey is a local thing to a node and not related to the other `-ac_` params

[20-May-19 05:53 AM] gcharang#6833
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#listaccounts
as a general rule anything related to accounts is deprecated a long time ago

I have started a fresh chain using two nodes on the same system with different data dirs, after the second node is launched, both were showing `connection: 1`
maybe try starting a fresh chain?

[20-May-19 05:56 AM] krtk6160#3131
I had already set the `pubkey`, and then I ran getaddressbalance for that address. It says 
`Error code: -5
No information available for the address`

[20-May-19 05:56 AM] krtk6160#3131
I'll start afresh now

[20-May-19 05:57 AM] krtk6160#3131
And then see if it fixes that

[20-May-19 05:57 AM] gcharang#6833
you can consolidate funds to a single address using `komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME sendtoaddress <ADDRESS> (komodo-cli  -ac_name=NAME getbalance) "" "" true`

[20-May-19 05:59 AM] gcharang#6833
if the pubkey was created on another wallet, you need to import the corresponding privkey for the balance to show up
and when you set the pubkey and mine on the same daemon, all mining rewards should go to that pubkey's address

[20-May-19 07:00 AM] krtk6160#3131
@gcharang I was able to successfully test it and it works

I read that 95% of all tokens in existence are atomic-swappable

[20-May-19 07:03 AM] krtk6160#3131
How can I try that functionality out?

[20-May-19 07:04 AM] krtk6160#3131
Say for example I made my own assetchain, and have 1000 tokens. If I have some ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, is it possible to exchange that somehow?

[20-May-19 07:06 AM] gcharang#6833
```

"coins"

```

by tokens, you mean the base coins or ones created using: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/tokens.html ?

ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain are swappable with 95% of coins. yes

[20-May-19 07:07 AM] krtk6160#3131
By tokens I mean the ones I get from mining on my own assetchain

[20-May-19 07:08 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, those are by default compatible with our DEX and swappable with any other crypto
version 1 of the backend is shelved for now and version2 is under testing. you can ask for access if you want to test that out

[20-May-19 07:10 AM] krtk6160#3131
So I can swap my base coins with some Ether, right?
Can I swap my base coins with a custom ERC20 token that's present on the Ethereum chain?

[20-May-19 07:10 AM] gcharang#6833
yes to both

[20-May-19 07:11 AM] krtk6160#3131
Wow

[20-May-19 07:11 AM] krtk6160#3131
Is there any guide to do that?

[20-May-19 07:12 AM] krtk6160#3131
Also, what if my tokens are not on the main Eth chain, but on one of the testing chains? Will it still be possible to somehow test swapping?

`getreceivedbyaddress` lists addresses that have atleast received some KMD

for all addresses ever created in your wallet:

`dumpwallet` creates a file with addresses - privkeys and other metadata

Too bad Magnum Wallet is sketchy. 
1) they don't offer the ability to show your receive address on the ledger nano device so you can confirm it's correct. this is standard expected of any wallet app that supports ledger nano. 
2) the browser pops up a notification that they are requesting permission to read the contents of your clipboard, that's very unsafe for a user to agree to
3) the team listed are anonymous

[23-May-19 04:54 PM] LeshAft9#0083
also for trying to transact with ledger nano, their site is broken due to CORS in brave (even with shields down) and firefox

[24-May-19 02:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
meaning you use native mode then before you updated your wallet
