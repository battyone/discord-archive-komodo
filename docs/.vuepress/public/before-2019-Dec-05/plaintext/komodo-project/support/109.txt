@bpkdasbaum you mean spv servers,

[05-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
?*

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just use the verus wallet to create a verus address with that seed

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
I just walked my wife through her first crypto transaction over the phone. All KMD sent to binance

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It will generate an R address that you can use for all komodo assets

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I cant open the agama wallet to remove the remaining funds of my wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
why is that?

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] alexander#4618
I was able to move my funds by exporting/restoring the wallet in verus agama - weird but it works fine with the same servers

[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Native mode isn‚Äôt safe either apparently.  Everyone please be safe and secure your coins!

[05-Jun-19 02:23 PM] ionstar#5362
Am I reading correctly that, when I download the Versu edition, I need to start Lite mode and choose VRSC instead of KMD?

[05-Jun-19 02:24 PM] flick#6039
@Cryptoon  In Versus, shall we create a IGUANA-256 address (there are other options too)?

[05-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
256 is the 24word seed phrase

[05-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is considered very safe üòÉ

[05-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just make sure you back it up securely

[05-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ionstar correct

[05-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ResoluteCrypto in theory as long as you did not import export wif keys in agama you should be fine, but better safe than sorry.

[05-Jun-19 02:28 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Yea JL said native mode was compromised as well. Getting different answers from different people so better to move the funds and not let this stress me out all day

[05-Jun-19 02:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
consider compromised anything that was imported in agama (included wif keys generated in native)

[05-Jun-19 02:30 PM] ionstar#5362
So how is the versus agama safer than the original agama

[05-Jun-19 02:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you have the slightest doubt that your priv keys / wifs / seeds touched agama this year MOVE your funds

[05-Jun-19 02:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ionstar Verus Agama has been verified as NOT vulnerable

[05-Jun-19 02:32 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch Can you please confirm that we should move the funds to a VersusCoin (not KMD) address!

[05-Jun-19 02:32 PM] ionstar#5362
Also, my old agama and versus live on the same windows pc. Versus complained that the original was running. Is there any "cross contamination"?

[05-Jun-19 02:32 PM] costa2439#3771
some of my assets have been moved to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF how do I claim them?

[05-Jun-19 02:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flick verus is using the same address format as kmd

[05-Jun-19 02:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
make sure you backup the seed from verus agama and you will be able to import it in a kmd wallet at a later date

[05-Jun-19 02:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
so, yes

[05-Jun-19 02:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
@costa2439 please read <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

[05-Jun-19 02:34 PM] wl#4107
I used one of the link in komods¬¥s support page to check my address and I see 0 kmd, what to do to recover my funds?

[05-Jun-19 02:35 PM] wl#4107
I've downloaded the verus agama walleet already

[05-Jun-19 02:36 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch "Connection error! Trying to switch to another server..." in old Agama. What to do?

[05-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Vulnerability discovered in Komodo‚Äôs Agama wallet - This is what...
We strongly recommend moving all funds from Agama (KMD, asset chain coins, and other assets) to a new address as soon as possible.

[05-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Create new seed/address using verus agama to get new R address

[05-Jun-19 02:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flick old agama is not compatible with new spv servers please follow the instructions at <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

[05-Jun-19 02:39 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch So we should use Agama webwallet, not Agama Desktop?

[05-Jun-19 02:40 PM] flick#6039
https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/ is not reachable (502 Bad Gateway)

[05-Jun-19 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flick setup verus agama and import the compromised seed there to send funds

[05-Jun-19 02:42 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch Ok, closing old Agama now. I'll open Versus Agama, log in with the compromised seed and transfer funds to the new VRSC (not KMD) addess I created, correct?

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
correct

[05-Jun-19 02:43 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you want to be sure send a small amount first and check your VRSC address in kmd explorer
<https://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info>

[05-Jun-19 02:44 PM] wl#4107
@mrlynch how do I send my funds to the verus wallet?

[05-Jun-19 02:45 PM] ionstar#5362
Ok, so I sent some KMD to my new VRSC address, but its not showing up. It is visible in the kmd explorer

[05-Jun-19 02:45 PM] alexander#4618
anybody have an idea what is PGT and NINJA? Do they worth anything? Just found I still have some VOTE2019 - I suppose these ones are expired already?

[05-Jun-19 02:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
looks like the web wallet is overload at the moment ...

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] wl#4107
Final Balance
0 KMD

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
NINJA is test tokens created before the start of the 2019 NN election

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] OsTa#2589
I have plenty of addresses and many assets and no blockchain sync. Only web wallet can help for now...

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] wl#4107
What can I do to recover my kmd?

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
@ionstar backup the seed from VRSC address - you will be able to import it into a kmd wallet later
it's not showing because you are looking at VRSC not KMD

[05-Jun-19 02:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
if it shows in explorer you're ok

[05-Jun-19 02:47 PM] SadykovT#2123
@alexander  PGT -Pungo .io

[05-Jun-19 02:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
@wl please read <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

[05-Jun-19 02:48 PM] ionstar#5362
So how can I check if the seed actually works with kmd? Can I use Verus to load /activate the KMD coin with te new seed? Or is that not advisable.

[05-Jun-19 02:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
you can if kmd is available

[05-Jun-19 02:49 PM] kolo#1111
@PHBA2061 ninja is NOT test token. But all loses will be returned to owners per request

{Reactions}
üëå 

[05-Jun-19 02:49 PM] ionstar#5362
Then why do the instruction sadvise to create a seed with VRSC and not the available KMD option?

[05-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Magnul wallet is safe?

[05-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Magnum*

[05-Jun-19 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
@Buddz1993 yes, it's not vulnerable

[05-Jun-19 02:51 PM] alen#3721
So R addresees are safe?

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ok

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
will give this as a new address

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
as all my funds were sent to the safe address

[05-Jun-19 02:53 PM] PTYX#6840
The first letter of the address is just a prefix, all komodo addresses start with R

[05-Jun-19 02:55 PM] nonapa#2231
Hi all, Is it safe to log into Verus Agama wallet with my old seed (from original agama wallet) and transfer my asset chain coins to the new address I have created with Verus Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 02:55 PM] alen#3721
Well my funds are still in agama..so i assume since komodo team didnt sweep them im cool

[05-Jun-19 02:55 PM] angrygnat#7242
can i use the lite version of verus to claim founds?

[05-Jun-19 02:56 PM] ionstar#5362
Why do the instructions advise to create a seed with VRSC when there is a KMD option available?

[05-Jun-19 02:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If I generated my Verus wallet address at the end of March... can I use this address to sweep my remaining KMD funds to or to claim the swept funds?

[05-Jun-19 02:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@alen if you generate you seed/WIF from or use your seed on Agama in the last 5 months or so, then your fund is probably not safe

[05-Jun-19 02:57 PM] flick#6039
@mrlynch I can see my funds now in the explorer but not in Versus. Why is this?

[05-Jun-19 02:57 PM] KT#1156
My Agama wallet opens, but turns blank immediately. Is that happening to you guys?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@nonapa Verus Agama is confirmed safe to use <https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview>

[05-Jun-19 02:58 PM] LeshAft9#0083
FYI the Coinomi wallet (at least mobile on Android) supports KMD and has a feature to sweep a wallet with WIF, BIP38, Mini private key.  Could be a helpful stopgap

[05-Jun-19 02:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
@nonapa yes
@alen no, move funds
@angrygnat i don't know
@ionstar the instructions were created in the heat of the moment
@FishyGuts if it was in verus agama yes, if in agama no; move funds

[05-Jun-19 02:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flick you need to activate KMD - you're probably currently looking at VRSC

[05-Jun-19 02:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
@KT please read <https://komodoplatform.com/vulnerability-discovered-in-komodos-agama-wallet-this-is-what-you-need-to-do/>

@mrlynch thanks

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] alen#3721
Moving all to binance for now

[05-Jun-19 03:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
seems that binance has deposit closed

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] KT#1156
@mrlynch  My fund is sent to the safe address according to the explorer. Yeah, Binance suspended deposit/withdrawal already.

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] angrygnat#7242
@mrlynch  thank you

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
@KT fill in the form then

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
@angrygnat np.. priority right now is to secure funds

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
`Connection error!

How to switch manually:
Go to "Settings", select "SPV Server List" tab, choose new server and click "OK".`

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] napa#5694
so, am using agama but i don't remember if i created a seed for it. i had initially set up my wallet in 2017. sent the coin and didn't use agama for a yr +, just finally downloaded agama a few weeks back and recovered my coins with the dat file. anyway, wondering if i will be fine, or should i move my coin to ocean wallet. was using agama cos i can earn residuals on the wallet but i don't know if that is also the case with ocean wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
In Verus Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] alen#3721
True..binance suspended kmd deposits due to wallet maintainance

[05-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Hammerstein#6697
I can‚Äôt access the mobile wallet at all

Any recommendations

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Berg#2666
I have a full bitcoin in Agama right now and can‚Äôt send it out... the wallet is infinitely calculating fees... I‚Äôve tried rebooting and everything I can think of.

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] PTYX#6840
use chameleon or guarda wallet with your seed and move the funds

[05-Jun-19 03:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
@FishyGuts @Hammerstein @Berg use chameleon pay mobile -> restore from backup -> use the seed -> send funds to safe addresses

[05-Jun-19 03:08 PM] KT#1156
@mrlynch  I am trying to send the form. Thanks.
