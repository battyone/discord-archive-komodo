@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 the 'app is closing' window is gone, but komodod still going, still not a good time to kill it?

[05-Nov-19 06:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
after 3 hours I doubt it's going to respond? 😄

[05-Nov-19 06:39 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
We'll go command line on it...
Open a command prompt,
go to the folder where your Agama.exe is unpacked and go to 
`resources\app\assets\bin\win64\`
Type `komodo-cli stop`

[05-Nov-19 06:40 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That should stop komodo. If that doesn't work, kill it using task manager

[05-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
already killed

[05-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pasted bootstrap in pirate folder again

now we are rethinking life

[05-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 different question, does verus agama have view mode? I remember kmd agama having such a functionality

[05-Nov-19 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you could just enter a kmd address and view rewards accrued to it

[05-Nov-19 07:14 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
You would have to import the viewkey into the wallet (in native mode)

[05-Nov-19 07:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah hmm, in kmd there was an easier way to do it in lite as well I think

[05-Nov-19 07:15 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Easiest way is to use Lite mode indeed, but you'ld need to do every seperate addres seperately

[05-Nov-19 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was only one address, someone in k64 scam channel is claiming KW once showed his address, but it was the supposed 'whalebro' address that someone just imported into view mode into agama

[05-Nov-19 08:34 PM] peddycb#5889
i've deleted hyperdex on my mac,
because I thought I could bring back the assets with atomicdex.

[05-Nov-19 08:34 PM] peddycb#5889
I should now download hyperdex again ?

[05-Nov-19 08:38 PM] Oszy#5734
don't delete anything unless you being told to delete something, my advice, wait for the next hyperdex release which supports refunding stuck swaps, until then, there is not much more you can do than you were already advised.
don't delete things if you have a problem.

[05-Nov-19 08:39 PM] Oszy#5734
you might have just deleted your trade data as well, so you don't even have that now

[05-Nov-19 08:47 PM] peddycb#5889
oh no... then I must hope now 🙈

[05-Nov-19 10:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you can check if appdata is still there

[06-Nov-19 08:00 AM] criptobear#6402
i have a question: if i enter my seed from before the hacking in the OOT wallet what can happen?

[06-Nov-19 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont think oot wallet was compromised, not sure

[06-Nov-19 08:07 AM] criptobear#6402
ok thx anyway i locked my OOT and they are in what i think is the address for locking but the locking period expired already many weeks ago and the funds are not returned

[06-Nov-19 08:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
you need to claim the funds back from the address

[06-Nov-19 08:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
login to your OOT wallet ( the one they provide)
and than ther eis a claim button to get your OOT back ( with rewards )

[06-Nov-19 08:41 AM] criptobear#6402
thank you i understood what happened and i was afraid because the address i used in march to lock them was one of those that could be hacked but fortunately i found them unlocked them and sent to new oot address

[06-Nov-19 08:41 AM] criptobear#6402
and locked them again

{Reactions}
💯 

[06-Nov-19 08:41 AM] criptobear#6402
😉

[06-Nov-19 09:47 AM] Oszy#5734
hacker probably didn't bother logging into all the seeds manually, and since it was locked it wasn't sent anywhere, or maybe you weren't even on his list.

[06-Nov-19 04:32 PM] athenamoon#9528
Hello. is there instructions how to claim komodo rewards from komodo oceat qt? I tried several times now and I still can't claim it...

[06-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Oszy#5734
send it to yourself (whole balance)

[06-Nov-19 04:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
Send the compelete balance to your own same address

[07-Nov-19 07:14 AM] Etienne#3794
Please, can anyone paste the link to the whitepaper?

[07-Nov-19 07:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@Etienne https://komodoplatform.com/whitepaper
but it is kinda outdated with all the new advancements

the "core-technology-discussions" section of our developer docs is a better representation of the current state of affairs: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/introduction.html>

[07-Nov-19 07:37 AM] Etienne#3794
Thanks

[07-Nov-19 12:05 PM] merrij#8253
hello 😉 is there a new guide for staking KMD? Because after the hack and my transfer to a new address in June, the staking isn´t working any longer in the Agama wallet. thx

[07-Nov-19 12:11 PM] Oszy#5734
KMD is not staking. 
You can claim rewards up to  every 30 days. In Agama, send your whole balance to yourself to the same address, and reward will be claimed/added to your balance.

[07-Nov-19 12:13 PM] Oszy#5734
If you are using lite mode (seed) you can use that seed in the mobile atomicDEX wallet, where you can find a `claim` button to help you with the claiming process.

[07-Nov-19 12:21 PM] merrij#8253
@Oszy Thank you. Well, there was the claiming button in Agama for a while. I will check it out with the sending.

[07-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
The green check UTXO button should be still there

[07-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Oszy#5734
Don't forget to do it every 30 days, it stops accumulating after that

explorer for commod is stuck !?

[07-Nov-19 08:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
No I think the chain is stalled because a big miner left

[07-Nov-19 08:03 PM] ciumete#3212
is not adaptive pow ?!

[07-Nov-19 08:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
not that I'm aware of

[07-Nov-19 08:04 PM] ciumete#3212
to bat, then is dead 🙂

[07-Nov-19 08:04 PM] ciumete#3212

Nah just wait for diff to drop

[08-Nov-19 11:18 AM] Arno#3334
Hi, how long does the "step 2/3 swap ongoing" take in AtomicDex? It's hanging there for circa 30 minutes now and no progress is made.

[08-Nov-19 11:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
what is the pair of your swap?

[08-Nov-19 11:29 AM] Arno#3334
kmd/dex

[08-Nov-19 11:29 AM] Arno#3334
After a restart of the app it was listed as successful in the history tab. So maybe it was a refresh issue.

[08-Nov-19 11:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
and you got your coins?
kmd/dex should be fast

[08-Nov-19 11:30 AM] Arno#3334
yes, gladly!

[08-Nov-19 11:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
great!

[08-Nov-19 07:34 PM] Arno#3334
Can anyone from the Komodo team confirm or deny if the concept of the DEX coin holders receiving 50% of the AtomicDEX fees is still valid for AtomicDEX? I couldn't find any official statement regarding this, but it has been described here:

[08-Nov-19 07:34 PM] Arno#3334
https://webworker.sh/assetchains

[08-Nov-19 07:37 PM] Arno#3334
There must be an official statement of what will be done with the fees generated by AtomicDEX.

[08-Nov-19 07:38 PM] Oszy#5734
Not a team member but yes it  is still valid for AtomicDEX, you can see collected fees by Dex here: https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php?address=RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf

It's not just atomicdex mobile fees, it's fees from every trade that uses / will use the atomicdex/marketmaker2 platform.

[08-Nov-19 07:40 PM] Arno#3334
Do you have an official source apart from the address accumulating the fee funds? Because it's one thing that there's an address collecting all fees, but another thing of what will happen with those funds. For example, have they ever been distributed so far? And to whom? Are there records of it?

[08-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Arno#3334
All we know for now is that there's a fee address accumulating funds, nothing more.

[08-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Oszy#5734
#ask-jl777 he can officially answer your question.
No nothing has been distributed yet. As far as I know it will happen at $1M USD collected.

[08-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Arno#3334
It's strange that this is not defined somewhere, like in a whitepaper or website. Compare it to other "dividend tokens", such as SpectreAI SXDT, Tenx Rewards token, etc. All well-defined.

[08-Nov-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what oszy says is correct

[08-Nov-19 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
we never did any ICO or offering for DEX, it was issued in 2014 on NXT platform

[08-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Arno#3334
And DEX is the official dividend token?

[08-Nov-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont do any promotion of it

[08-Nov-19 07:50 PM] Arno#3334
Why is this not properly communicated?

[08-Nov-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX is the official revshare coin

[08-Nov-19 07:51 PM] Arno#3334
Like being transparent regarding the structure, fees, and receiver of fees etc.

[08-Nov-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it is one thing if someone seeks the information out

[08-Nov-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but we dont want to be doing anything that could be considered promoting it

[08-Nov-19 07:51 PM] Arno#3334
Thanks for taking the time to answer, by the way.

[08-Nov-19 07:51 PM] jl777c#5810
half the fees go to DEX, distributed when there is sufficient amount collected

[08-Nov-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
this is transparent and the people that know, know

[08-Nov-19 07:52 PM] Arno#3334
So how are all the other funds supposed to be converted (and distributed) to KMD on the fly before distributing them?

[08-Nov-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
for coins with significant amounts, atomicDEX will be used to convert it to KMD

[08-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Arno#3334
Are they being sold on AtomicDEX themselves then?

[08-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Arno#3334
I see.

[08-Nov-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX is only trading in the after market, by people that already have it

[08-Nov-19 07:54 PM] Arno#3334
Yes. Do you know any other trading places besides AtomicDEX? It's hard to get in quantities.

[08-Nov-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
other than atomicDEX, OTC would be the only way i know of

[08-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Arno#3334
So far I thought KMD would be the beneficiary of AtomicDEX, but now it sounds more like it's DEX.

[08-Nov-19 07:57 PM] Oszy#5734
You get discount on fees for KMD pairs, 10% right jl?

[08-Nov-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, and all the non-KMD fees will drive demand for KMD

[08-Nov-19 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is important to keep KMD a currency and move anything that can be interpreted as a security away from KMD

[08-Nov-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only 1 million DEX, so compared to KMD of 116 million, the revshare is much more meaningful for DEX

[08-Nov-19 08:00 PM] Arno#3334
Thanks for clarifying.

[08-Nov-19 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont forget, that the DEX revshare needs to be converted into kmd. So all the third party coins need to be sold into kmd so they can be distributed as dividends to DEX holders. This alone will increase demand even more for kmd. Apart from people mainly wanting to trade kmd pairs because of lower fees 😉
