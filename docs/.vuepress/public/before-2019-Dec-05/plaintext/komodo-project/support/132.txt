Reminder:

‚ö°Ô∏èSecurity notice for Telegram‚ö°Ô∏è 

In your settings, go to privacy and security, under your phone number, select to share this with nobody as its defaulted to everyone.

That‚Äôs unacceptable and a security risk for pirates and SIM swaps.

Nobody in telegram needs your phone number and Telegram is stupid for defaulting it to share.

[08-Jun-19 04:22 AM] jonestown#0373
I've followed step 6, turned on proxy, but the error persists. Tried restarting the comp as well...any other suggestions? didn't have these issues with the compromised agama wallet

[08-Jun-19 04:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Thanks @jonestown

[08-Jun-19 04:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it could be needing an exception in the firewall?

[08-Jun-19 04:24 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If you arent sure how to do that, you can let me know which firewall you use (in DM if preffered) and I should  be able to link you to a guide

[08-Jun-19 04:24 AM] jonestown#0373

[08-Jun-19 04:25 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just reread your earlier message. Proxy needs to be turned **off**.

[08-Jun-19 04:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
make sure to click the "save config" button and exit / restart Agama once done

[08-Jun-19 04:27 AM] jonestown#0373
oh it needs to be turned off...it was turned off initially. will restart app thanks

[08-Jun-19 04:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if all else fails, use native. Takes a while to sync but we can speed it up with a bootstrap

[08-Jun-19 04:28 AM] jonestown#0373
it's working now, it's weird since I initially had the same issue witht he proxy off. it's working now however. thank you for double checking my message

[08-Jun-19 04:30 AM] jonestown#0373
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator getting a unable to get transaction history error on old wallet - is that normal?

[08-Jun-19 04:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
old versions of Agama might be running on outdated Electrumso SPV wont work. That message can also happen if history is too large (normally from numerous mining transactions)

[08-Jun-19 04:33 AM] jonestown#0373
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator does it effect sending transactions?

[08-Jun-19 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if it is SPV related, it might, but Verus version should be on newer SPV.

[08-Jun-19 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
There are ways to clear it on Native mode, but probably easier to create a new address and send funds there

[08-Jun-19 04:40 AM] jonestown#0373
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator got it thank you - the amount i received in the refund process leaves very little for transactiopn fee

[08-Jun-19 06:26 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```The refund Process


We will use a three-step process for processing claim:


1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.

2. You need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified in the form.

... 
f your claim qualifies for early refund, please check to see if you have received the special transaction. Then make sure you send it to the re-claim address you specified on the form.
...
If you didn‚Äôt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute, you have filed too many claims, or the amount of KMD does not match. Claims with conflicting information will be done after the easy cases are done.
```

I'm about to fill out the missing funds claim form but I have a question first.  It looks like the attacker tried to withdraw many different amounts from my wallet address.  In fact the amounts were way over anything I ever had to begin with.  I want to make an accurate claim submittal but I'm having a hard time finding a combination of transactions that add up to what I believe the real balance should be.  Any suggestions?  I can get it close, within 5 KMD but if I go over, will they just send me the correct amount or will it be a problem?

Hi everyone,
There is a little less than 20KMD difference between what I had in my vulnerable wallet and what I claimed in the form (which was an extraction of the sweep tx as seen on the explorer). My guess is that this was the 5% unclaimed rewards
My question is, as I can't find the 17ish KMD in my vulnerable wallet, nor on the blockchain, should I consider them gone or there is also a way to find those reward ?
Thank you for your response!

[08-Jun-19 07:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@GuilouGuilouOTE send me address and I'll have a look.

[08-Jun-19 07:07 AM] almasya#0676
"The amount sent in the first payment: 0.00053034 KMD encodes the refund amount too, just subtract 0.0002 KMD from it and multiply by 100000000. So (0.00053034 KMD - 0.0002 KMD)*100000000 = 33,034 KMD is the amount we were able to move from the address."           33 034  or 33,034 ??????      there may be no accuracy

@herchyb you'll need to exit ocean-qt, then rename your wallet dat. When loading again, a new wallet.dat will be generated. You'll have to import the private key of your new address also.
