@TS
TXID is the specific one for the transaction you swept out, is it correct?

[05-Jun-19 08:22 AM] TS#7923
correct

[05-Jun-19 08:22 AM] Scarborough#9066
Thank you

[05-Jun-19 08:23 AM] hastrup#8742
i have try both spv

[05-Jun-19 08:24 AM] Mische#6695
Don‚Äôt activate KMD via the Verus wallet, activate VRSC and use the vrsc address

[05-Jun-19 08:25 AM] hastrup#8742
aa

[05-Jun-19 08:25 AM] hastrup#8742
ok

[05-Jun-19 08:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes RSg is the safe address, you just have to claim them from the dev team

[05-Jun-19 08:25 AM] beor#1569
Hi, one question, can I use a address created two years ago, and never used?

[05-Jun-19 08:25 AM] hastrup#8742
but how do i get them back from the vrsc address?

[05-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Mische#6695
The vrsc addy is the same as the KMD addy, when the new wallet will be released you will have access to your funds, the addys share the same seed

[05-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Mische#6695
Make sure to back up your seed

[05-Jun-19 08:28 AM] hastrup#8742
ok so step 1. make a verus wallet after that backup seed. 2 chek that the addy is the same as the on whit the seed. move all your fund jumblr bots dex revs bet chips etc. etc to the VERUS ADDY you just createt i am getting it right?

[05-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Scarborough#9066
@TS
For the columns on your form, "Coin name, Address, Balance & TXID", the Address refers to my original Agama wallet address, not your whitehat address, correct?

[05-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Mische#6695
Step 1: install vrsc wallet, step 2: activate vrsc lite mode and create new address, step 3: back up your seed/wif key, step 4: send your KMD and assetchain funds to the new address

[05-Jun-19 08:32 AM] TS#7923
yes @Scarborough that's correct

[05-Jun-19 08:32 AM] t0sma#0368
Use the web version  https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/ One of my friend used this to move KMD to antother wallet. He will buy a Ledger !

[05-Jun-19 08:33 AM] bit_chipper#6010
how is the command line option secure if its still through agama?

[05-Jun-19 08:33 AM] hastrup#8742
yes using webwallet and getting connection error for assetchains

[05-Jun-19 08:33 AM] hastrup#8742
what to do then?

[05-Jun-19 08:34 AM] onebluesky#9439
@bit_chipper  I think because it's not using the affected libraries

[05-Jun-19 08:34 AM] bit_chipper#6010
ah i see, thanks @onebluesky

[05-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Mische#6695
Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
Start VRSC Lite mode 
Create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchains.
Keep the seed safely backed up (make a note of that address)

[05-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Mische#6695
The new address can store all Komodo assetchains linked to it, even if the wallet you are using does not display those coins. Make sure to backup the seed / private key.  As long as you have the these safely stored, you can access your funds later.

If you have Agama installed, use that to send funds out. If experiencing SPV connection issues, try an alternative below. 

Use Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

@Crypto Rich no need to move ARRR

[05-Jun-19 08:36 AM] SHossain#0007
they use native mode which is not affected

[05-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Scarborough#9066
@TS
1. I just submitted the form, when will I get my fund back?
2 . Can we get staking if you adopted new wallet in the future?
Thank you!

[05-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@beor best to generate a new one and be safe

[05-Jun-19 08:40 AM] TS#7923
@Scarborough I have no info about the timeline, just helping out the support teeam, but we are on it (not more than a day or two I guess). Yes, staking will come in the new wallet, not in the first version, but soon.

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] beor#1569
Ok, thanks!

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
@SHossain   I can't seem to see my ZEX. The tx showing in my ZEX are for my ARRR

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] SHossain#0007

Verus agama wallet dont connect to any server

[05-Jun-19 08:43 AM] beor#1569
can I used a old Agama version to move my KMDs to the new address?

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] hastrup#8742
its only for verus coin not the asset or komodo coin

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] beor#1569
is safe the version 0.3.4  to used in SPV mode?

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Esp#9308
I made my wallet in vrsc mode now how do I get the kmd back?

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Crypto Rich#6241

[05-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@beor the R adress generated with the seed can also be used for kmd and all it's assetchains

[05-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
same seed will generate the same wallet address for all komodo and assetchains

[05-Jun-19 08:45 AM] beor#1569
ok

[05-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so if you generate an R address for Verus, you can use the same seed for KMD/DEX/SUPERNET/OOT/ZILLA/......

[05-Jun-19 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and you will be able to access funds that way

[05-Jun-19 08:45 AM] beor#1569
perfect, thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:00 AM] ballistic#2323

[05-Jun-19 09:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@ballistic that doesn't look like a valid address to me,  there's a few characters missing ...
