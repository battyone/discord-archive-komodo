thank you @Decker i never thought 4gb wasn't enough done it so many time with 4gb on VM's tho those were 16.04 vM's

[22-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Decker#3767
@phm87 also, i don't know how he tried to compile. if he just used configure / make - he defenitely would get an error ... bcz cclib should be compiled too. zcutil build.sh script contains all needed for the build. he don't need to ./configure anything manually.

[22-Oct-19 04:16 PM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhhh it seems that my friend did not use zcutil/build.sh (he is too used to btc clones, we forgot ut is forked from zcash). We will try again

[22-Oct-19 04:17 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the explanation. I will tell him

[22-Oct-19 04:18 PM] Oszy#5734
as i can see he disabled stuff that may be needed

[22-Oct-19 04:19 PM] Oszy#5734
oh he just did make install?

[22-Oct-19 04:19 PM] phm87#7395
He had no problem to compile GENX (another zcash fork) or VDL

[22-Oct-19 04:19 PM] phm87#7395
Yes I think he use make instead of zcutil/build.sh

[22-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Oszy#5734
ahem okay :p

[22-Oct-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry

[22-Oct-19 04:22 PM] phm87#7395
But maybe vdl and genx does not have zcutil folder ...

[22-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Decker#3767
> He had no problem to compile GENX (another zcash fork) or VDL
i guess it's bcz of cclib ... other zcash forks don't have a CC üôÇ

[22-Oct-19 04:23 PM] phm87#7395
It makes sense

[23-Oct-19 02:16 AM] Mylo#8306

Komodo support team, any guidance on a timed out swap and return of funds eta ?

[27-Oct-19 11:22 PM] Bernardo94#7153
Hello, I need help, I have atomic dex on my smartphone, but for days I try to enter and the screen only comes out in black, what should I do?

[27-Oct-19 11:23 PM] Oszy#5734
@FraMauro refund will be given in 4 hours.

[27-Oct-19 11:23 PM] Oszy#5734
@Bernardo94 uninstall the app and install again, have your seed backed up, you'll have to enter it again.

[27-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Bernardo94#7153
How do I make the backup?

Hello.

[28-Oct-19 01:51 AM] ubhillutd#3274
I recently updated the app to try and participate in the stress testing on Oct 31. When I tried to open the app I had a black screen show up. I just posted in the atomic dex chat on discord. Ca333 mentioned that I should reach out to support as it appears I may have misplaced my seed phrase. I've tried looking for three days now. I've given up. He mentioned that you guys could help me downgrade the app and the re-up date it. Sorry for the inconvenience.

[28-Oct-19 01:55 AM] FraMauro#5957
Had timeout on swap about 8 hours ago and no refund yet. Can tech support assist ?

[28-Oct-19 02:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@FraMauro Are you using mobile AtomicDEX? If yes - there should be refund button in swaps history

[28-Oct-19 02:37 AM] FraMauro#5957
The history is blank, I reinstalled in a troubleshooting effort

[28-Oct-19 03:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Information about swap storing locally - after you delete the app data flushed and refund now is very hard to perform. Do you have swap uuid saved somewhere? Is swap amount huge? Maybe you can share txid of transaction you performed in this swap?

Thank you! It‚Äôll take some time to find information about your swap and find out best way for the funds recovery. I‚Äôll update you trough DM

[28-Oct-19 03:52 AM] FraMauro#5957
Thanks !

[28-Oct-19 07:04 AM] Oszy#5734
@Bryan_Beus not sure if you succeeded but try with -j1 and more than 4GB RAM

[28-Oct-19 07:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Oszy 

Thanks, yes, RAM was the issue. Solved now.
