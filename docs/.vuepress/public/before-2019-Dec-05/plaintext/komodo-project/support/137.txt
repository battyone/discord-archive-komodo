[09-Jun-19 04:51 PM] WK#7119
The problem is I don't have a dust anymore on my old address. How should I confirm Guarda's address in the form?

[09-Jun-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
dust is still in RE2emqs9rFh9wodmfQHgSnu7J5RfKi9vwJ, send all funds from there to the new address

[09-Jun-19 04:56 PM] WK#7119
Yes, that's my address. Correct. Can I now send to Guarda?or do I have to rewrite the form?

[09-Jun-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you must sent to the same address you claim, otherwise it is marked as a dispute. so make sure you have claimed the same address you will send to

[09-Jun-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Jun-19 05:11 PM] WK#7119
Form is claimed for Bitpanda. But I just sent it to Guarda. I've just made measurements.I'm excited.I've never chabbed such problems. I'm definitely in a fight now.

[09-Jun-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810

use the verus wallet

[09-Jun-19 05:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@poznangoat 
have you moved your funds from old seed to new seed?

[09-Jun-19 05:21 PM] poznangoat#0127
No, I need to withdraw from funds from Bittrex but withdrawals and deposits are suspended.

[09-Jun-19 05:21 PM] puls4rr#1354
Hi, I have sent the form with verus address, then I resend the form with ocean address, later I sent the dust to ocean address, I will receive my found or dispute ?

[09-Jun-19 05:22 PM] poznangoat#0127
So just wanted to know when you guys think withdrawals and deposits from exchanges will be up and running again?

[09-Jun-19 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
next weekend after the new notary hardupdate

[09-Jun-19 05:31 PM] poznangoat#0127
jeez, ok, thanks for info. Guess my KMD is lost then.

[09-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Steelrat#2421
My Agama Wallet Screen goes blank 1 sec. after opening, Have the small amount of coins, but cannot send them, because all blank. Is there another way to send - for example in the browser? Will use that old seed just one time more anyway, so security is not a real issue...

[09-Jun-19 05:41 PM] gcharang#6833
@Steelrat use the old seed and login to the Verus agama

[09-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Steelrat#2421

@allbits I'm a NY resident, so I have to get all of my funds out of Bittrex by the end of today, but can't because the withdrawals are suspended.

[09-Jun-19 06:18 PM] allbits#5898
Oh wow! Can you trade into another currency on bittrex and withdraw that?

[09-Jun-19 06:20 PM] poznangoat#0127
No, trading has been suspended for like a month and a half --- I've been travelling so haven't really had the chance to log-in and withdraw until the end of the this week but the wallet has been under maintenance

[09-Jun-19 06:24 PM] bouch#7580
@poznangoat  That is really unfortunate, and I don't think you have any recourse but to submit a help ticket and ask for an extension. Tell them you will report this to the NY Attorney General or NY Financial Services office perhaps if they won't help

[09-Jun-19 06:27 PM] poznangoat#0127
@bouch yeah, that's what I'm probably what I'm going to do
