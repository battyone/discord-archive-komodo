I'm going to send them a message and let them know.

Where do you think the error is in this workflow?

Is this a normal practice for distros of Ubuntu to exclude these libraries, so any distro would have this issue? Or is this something unique to Pop OS itself?

[24-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can we add gcc-7 and g++-7 to the libraries that should be installed, in the docs.komodoplatform.com documentation on installing manually?

[24-Jan-19 10:02 PM] SHossain#0007
they are using updated gcc version. komodo source doesn't use gcc 8

[24-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not very familiar with gcc. 

is this something that we should change in the docs? Or is it something that I should let Pop know is causing issues? Or is it that the Komodo developer workflow hasn't updated to gcc 8 yet, but may at some point in the future?

Install gcc-8 only on Ubuntu 18.04?
I just installed Lubuntu 18.04 LTS. There are two options for installing gcc: gcc-7 and gcc-8. Both are available from apt-get install out of the box. 

Even after I installed gcc-8, the system is ...

[24-Jan-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus the gcc8 comes as default with Ubuntu 18.10. popOS got it that way. you need to install gcc7 to run komodo for now.

[24-Jan-19 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
it may be updated in the future

[24-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It looks like installing `build-essential` should add gcc-7 into the libraries?

[24-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I see that build-essential is already in our preset commands...

[24-Jan-19 10:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to figure out where the issue is, to make sure that we don't have customers who have the same issue.

[24-Jan-19 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
ubuntu 18.10 released recently and not a lot devs/users are using it

[24-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[24-Jan-19 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
ubuntu 16.04 still has support and most of notary nodes and other infrastructure are running on it. some of us using 18.04 which is also LTS and doesn't have this issue

[24-Jan-19 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
the next logical version to update to would be 20.04 for us from 18.04

[24-Jan-19 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
not 18.10 or 19.04 or 19.10

[24-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

any odd version is test version and any x.10 is test version with short lifecycle

[24-Jan-19 10:15 PM] SHossain#0007
x.04 gets 5 year support

[24-Jan-19 10:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
gotcha,

Okay, I see now.

So, it seems that it's the 18.10 aspect that's the issue, and it has less to do with Pop itself.

I believe that have an 18.04 version, and that probably should be listed as the default download on their homepage.

On my own time, I will try to roll back my system to 18.04, and I will send Pop a message letting them know about what happened.

Thanks.

[24-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This was all very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to work through it with me.

[24-Jan-19 10:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can we add a note somewhere in the docs about this?

[24-Jan-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Could we put it in the docs.komodoplatform.com 

https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html

I would suggest putting this in the section title Linux

```
For Ubuntu, we recommend only using Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
```

[24-Jan-19 10:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[24-Jan-19 10:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, if I have access to the docs.komodoplatform.com stuff, I can put that in there now, assuming you're okay with it.

[24-Jan-19 10:19 PM] SHossain#0007
you can always submit a PR if you don't have direct access

[24-Jan-19 10:20 PM] SHossain#0007
you have write access to that repo

[24-Jan-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I'm doing it now

[24-Jan-19 10:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and komodod is finally running on my machine.

Thank you!

@SHossain 

I just put a question up in #dev-general 
Do you mind taking a look?

[25-Jan-19 04:40 AM] UncutMataii (Sean)#7260
is there an app coming to Ledger or should I use magnum wallet now?

[25-Jan-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain if there is some reproducible error based on a new compiler, that seems like we need to have decker look into it? maybe it also happens with zcash itself and they can fix it upstream?

[25-Jan-19 10:14 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll test zcash see what happens

Hi. I am stuck on swap 4/5 in Hyperdex.  I followed the https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024479-my-swap-is-stuck-what-to-do-now- instruction a couple of days ago, but still nothing returned. Any suggestion for a next step?

[26-Jan-19 09:57 PM] Jurjen#9294
And lost 0.00062074 BTC, I guess for the transaction or so

[26-Jan-19 09:58 PM] Jurjen#9294
I hope it wont happen to much, it was my first atomic swap

[26-Jan-19 10:04 PM] SHossain#0007
that was DEX fee and it is not refundable. until MM2 is released please try not to do any BTC swaps.

[26-Jan-19 10:07 PM] Jurjen#9294
Okay thanks. Then what do you suggest to get Komodo by Hyperdex. ETH?

[26-Jan-19 10:16 PM] SHossain#0007
you can try BTC, but 100% success not guaranteed

[26-Jan-19 10:19 PM] Jurjen#9294

can someone guide me on how to stake OUR/how to run komodo binary on windows and stake coins?

[27-Jan-19 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
from command line - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024482-how-to-install-agama-on-windows-using-command-line

[27-Jan-19 09:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
from Agama - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024481-how-to-install-agama-on-windows

[27-Jan-19 09:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once you are syncronised, the command for staking is `setgenerate true 0`

[27-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and once i do that how would i run another chain (OUR)

[27-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and import my address i have in agama  windows

[27-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
into the cli so i can stake it there 😮

[27-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
sorry for all the questions 😅

[27-Jan-19 09:39 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
first you'll have to wait for OUR to be on the list of coins you can activate

[27-Jan-19 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and it'll have to be run in Native mode

[27-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Was hoping there was a way to do it through the binaries cli 😮

[27-Jan-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you can run cli commands in Agama - https://support.komodoplatform.com/a/solutions/articles/29000026800-agama-desktop-cli-command-line-

[27-Jan-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and also in console

[27-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so i can use agama and some cli commands to stake the coins that isnt on the list of ''activate'' coins? 😮

[27-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
thanks for all the help btw

You cant stake coins though Agama if they are not available in Agama Native mode

[27-Jan-19 01:53 PM] SHossain#0007
@Crabby Paddy OUR is not listed in Agama yet. OUR team didn't submit any PR yet. So, most likely next version of Agama

[27-Jan-19 01:54 PM] SHossain#0007
for now, CLI is the way.

[27-Jan-19 09:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

I spoke with the developers for the Pop_OS distro, and told them about what happened. (gcc-7 not being installed by default, and only gcc-8, and that causing issues when compiling from source.)

I also told them that you suggested that I only use 18.04, since it's LTS and 18.10 is not.

They responded that when running Ubuntu on server technology you want to stay with an LTS version, when you are working with desktop users you do not. 

In the past, when distro developers let their users get behind the latest release of Ubuntu, this ends up causing more issues long-term, as they get stuck on previous releases (16.04, 14.04), and they can't upgrade to the latest release in any timely fashion.

It becomes a trap that keeps open-source projects from being able to progress.

So, they're keeping 18.10 as the default download, and they also plan to push everyone to 19.04 (and 19.10) within six months of the release dates.

FYI. I don't make any opinion myself, and I am happy to roll back to 18.04 myself for my komodo-related machines. Will do it whenever I can find the time. 

@jl777c @ca333 You might also find this interesting ^

[27-Jan-19 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007

Hey guys i'm not sure if you can directly help with the Magnum wallet but i feel like you could help. 

I'm unable to claim my reward and have had well over 10KMD in this address for sometime. I don't have the option to claim in the specified wallets dashboard either. Should i just shoot the Magnum support team an email?

@REX the reward  claim function may not be activated yet on magnum wallet. you need to get in touch with magnum team for more info.

[29-Jan-19 02:23 PM] PTYX#6840
@REX the reward claiming function isn't working on Magnum. They are waiting on a Ledger update that will bring back the ability to claim interest with the hardware wallet. For now, you can send and receive from Magnum.

[29-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
@PTYX is it setting nlocktime properly for sends?

[29-Jan-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
you should probably clarify that if the user ever sent KMD from the ledger wallet using ledger software, the change output immediately stopped accruing rewards

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Jan-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
their software doesn't set nlocktime properly

[29-Jan-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
If the send transaction set the nlocktime then claim interest would work.

[29-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Alright#0419
@PTYX yes I'm asking if Magnum is currently setting it

[29-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
if not, as soon as user sends KMD using it, the change stops accruing rewards

[29-Jan-19 05:09 PM] PTYX#6840
Sorry lost connection

[29-Jan-19 05:09 PM] PTYX#6840
I agree, I'll make sure I let people know that if they send the nlocktime isn't set

I haven't been keeping up with crypto in a while. I see that KMD has been forked.I keep me KMD keys, on the ledger nano s. Can i lose access to my funds if i just keep them there, or is it okay not to get a new wallet, before i have to move my funds?
