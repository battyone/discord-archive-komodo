@Kyung-Nam Park we will check on centos, there we need some dependencies which we need to install additionally.
we have more community support on ubuntu, if you have possiblity just try on that

[11-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Lumbi#8378
I also recommend Linux users to always :
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y before rebuilding to 0.3.3b :
```#!/bin/bash
cd ~/komodo
git pull --rebase
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

[11-Jan-19 01:12 PM] Antonina#2886
is it working? why the orderbook is empty? I really want to try your atomic swap feature, could you help me please? maybe this isn't correct chat and I should use another?

[11-Jan-19 01:28 PM] Nabob#5004
Please try beer and pizza pairs of testing Barterdex, You can also try #dex-hyperdex  for User friendly Interface.

[11-Jan-19 01:56 PM] Antonina#2886
I can't add pizza on dashboard (error: can't find coind). also I can't create withdraw transaction for my btc.

[11-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Nabob#5004
you can use agama to access Btc funnds, 
above error means pizza onn native mode has some probblem, Unable to detect. Try checkinng pizza electrum

[11-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Antonina#2886
I tried electrum and had the same error

[11-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Nabob#5004
Did you tried pizza on hyperdex ?

[11-Jan-19 02:21 PM] Antonina#2886
no, only barterdex

[11-Jan-19 02:23 PM] Antonina#2886
where can I find it?

[11-Jan-19 02:25 PM] NeithEnder#1111
Ledger said that deposits and withdrawals was to resume soon? any idea on exactly around when?

thanks. but my point about pizza token is still valid

[11-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Antonina#2886
I mean in HyperDEX there are no such coins as pizza and beer

[11-Jan-19 04:34 PM] cipi#4502
i see 5 asks and 5 bids in BTC/KMD-orderbook... you need to wait couple of minutes after starting before the orderbook shows up, your node needs to get the info from the other nodes first

[11-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Regnar#6164
Hey I just started trying out the komodo-cli for windows 10, is there a way to check status of block index? I'm getting `error code: -28   error message: Rewinding blocks if needed...`

[11-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Regnar#6164
Actually I went from loading block index, rewinding blocks if needed, verifying blocks. lol so that seems like progress 😃

[11-Jan-19 11:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is not error

[11-Jan-19 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just wait for the komodod to complete initialisation

[11-Jan-19 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you'll get answer to your commands once it's complete

[11-Jan-19 11:53 PM] Regnar#6164
cool! yea I haven't messed with command line yet so I have no idea what to expect haha

There is no doubt a better way to handle that, but it works and it easy to follow. I was using it yesterday. Simply add a new function by copy paste for each RPC you need to use.. then to use it:
`getpubkey_result = kmdrpc.getpubkey_rpc('MGNX')`
for example... which will give you a string containing the -pubkey that is set.
I added a `setpubkey` aswell... so you dont have to restart deamon to set it.

[12-Jan-19 02:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Thanks @blackjok3r I'm still "activating the best blocks" right now but I'll check it out

@Kyung-Nam Park this is because your node was on a fork, you may need to resync

@ca333 do you know if that build above has the new maxreorg thing?

[13-Jan-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
Ah nope, it never made it to master. That was the remedy for this problem.

[13-Jan-19 11:53 PM] Alright#0419
@Kyung-Nam Park you can try `invalidateblock 052bd85cb70e1ec2184f7e68dd3f21b6bee5fd0d5dbd3c58df0080d1babc0f39` as soon as you start the node. Wait a moment, then do `reconsiderblock 052bd85cb70e1ec2184f7e68dd3f21b6bee5fd0d5dbd3c58df0080d1babc0f39`. Not sure this will work, but it's worth a try

[13-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Alright#0419
if that doesn't work, you can either resync or build from this branch https://github.com/jl777/komodo/commits/beta then start with node with `./komodod -maxreorg=175`

After installing dependencies clone the Komodo repository:

You need to compile komodo first and then check for that file @SlhCn

click on those 3 lines on the right-side. that will display the text box below.
change 0 to 1 the right. if you still don't see your address, keep increasing the number

Does anyone find that Komodo keeps going down on conversion sites like shapeshift allcoins etc?
