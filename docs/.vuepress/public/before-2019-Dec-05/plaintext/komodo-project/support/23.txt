do you enter the lite mode version of the wallet with your seed or do you use a pin ?

[03-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Nate#8035
seed, lite mode, yes

[03-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Nate#8035
no pin

[03-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Hermes#6934
ok then you can proceed to erasing the Agama folder located in  %appdata% folder

[03-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Hermes#6934
after this is done try to install again

[03-Aug-18 10:57 PM] Nate#8035
ok, so agama is currently installed but corrupt, am I simply running a file search for "%appdata%" and if so where might I find it?

[03-Aug-18 10:58 PM] Nate#8035
apologies for my ignorance, just don't want to lose my KMD

[03-Aug-18 11:09 PM] Jonathan#3687
What OS @Nate

[03-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Nate#8035
windows

[03-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Jonathan#3687
version?

[03-Aug-18 11:10 PM] Nate#8035
10

[03-Aug-18 11:11 PM] Jonathan#3687
type %appdata% into the bottom left search bar, it'll show right away as a folder as the top option

[03-Aug-18 11:11 PM] Jonathan#3687
the main windows search bar

[03-Aug-18 11:13 PM] Nate#8035
done

[03-Aug-18 11:13 PM] Nate#8035
now choose agama, i assume

[03-Aug-18 11:14 PM] Nate#8035
opened it, only has "logs" as a folder, which is empty

[03-Aug-18 11:15 PM] Hermes#6934
No need to open it just erase the Agama folder

[03-Aug-18 11:16 PM] Hermes#6934
And proceed with the installation

üëç 

[03-Aug-18 11:16 PM] Nate#8035
ok, doing that now

[03-Aug-18 11:17 PM] Nate#8035
If I go to the agama website and simply re download the file just as if I was updating it will that be ok? Or do I need to uninstall what I have and then download again

[03-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Hermes#6934
By clicking the install set up it should only do the install because Agama has been erased at that point

{Reactions}
üëç 

[03-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Nate#8035
ok

[03-Aug-18 11:25 PM] Nate#8035
went through the install process and restarted my computer. I did say "current version detected" when doing that. After the restart the agama short cut and actual application isn't even showing up on my desktop. (has every other time Ive updated or installed before)

[03-Aug-18 11:27 PM] Nate#8035
just to double check, I searched %appdata% again (deleted this before restart) and agama is not there as option.

[03-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Hermes#6934
When it said current version detected then a pop up window should have come in the background asking for an uninstall

[03-Aug-18 11:32 PM] Hermes#6934
But that doesn‚Äôt seem correct if the program has been completely installed it should launch after the installation

[03-Aug-18 11:34 PM] Nate#8035
correct, thats exactly what i thought

[03-Aug-18 11:34 PM] Nate#8035
but again, the %appdata% folder you had me search only had a log file in it, which was empty, nothing in it. So I basically deleted nothing.

[03-Aug-18 11:36 PM] Hermes#6934
Please send us a support ticket at support@komodoplatform.com with screenshots of the issue and we will get back to you shortly

[03-Aug-18 11:36 PM] Hermes#6934
I still believe this can be due to a corrupt download also send in the ticket the file size of the version you are downloading

[03-Aug-18 11:37 PM] Nate#8035
like the size of the AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-windows-installer file?

[03-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Nate#8035
just sent an email with pic of error attached

[03-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Nate#8035
sorry for the noob issues

[03-Aug-18 11:44 PM] Hermes#6934
Yes

[03-Aug-18 11:44 PM] Hermes#6934
The whole file size that you get when you download it from the website

[03-Aug-18 11:44 PM] Nate#8035
79.4 MB

[03-Aug-18 11:45 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok we will respond through the ticket

[03-Aug-18 11:46 PM] Hermes#6934
Also send us the picture of the %appdata% folder if you can

[03-Aug-18 11:50 PM] Nate#8035
Its gone. No agama there anymore.

[03-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> No problem we will get back to you shortly , in this type of cases we will need to document it on the ticket because we haven‚Äôt seen this type of scenario

[03-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Nate#8035
No problem, thx

[04-Aug-18 12:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If we need to redownload rescan an asset chain from scratch and we don't want to use Agama, which files in the directory do we delete?

ASSETCHAIN.conf and then one of the folders?

[04-Aug-18 12:58 AM] Nabob#5004
@Bryan_Beus  If you want to run cli way run this
```refer this, you need to mention ac_supply mandatorily, when you are triggering cli way

[04-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
getting lots of errors

[04-Aug-18 01:03 AM] Nabob#5004
above command is for reference, also good way is to run asset chains one by one considering your resources

[04-Aug-18 01:03 AM] Nabob#5004
Have you checked, daemon started in background ?

[04-Aug-18 01:14 AM] Nabob#5004
running asset chains from scratch you need to have conf file alone is sufficient to start chain

[04-Aug-18 01:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's loading blocks now.

Do we need to do the full `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ASSET -ac_supply=1234` for every command?

[04-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Nabob#5004
yes, ac_supply is must

is there a way to get agama to show past 15 pages of transactions?

[04-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Nabob#5004
`export to CSV `on Bottom left , Provide all transaction details of coin in csv format @Deleted User

[04-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Nabob  sorry wheres the option?

[04-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
im looking on verus agama tbh, trying to get a list of transactions

[04-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Deleted User#0000

[04-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Nabob#5004

Hello...any BarterDEX experts here?

[05-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Hermes#6934
Hi there how can we help you ?

[05-Aug-18 02:31 AM] tolken#2655
With bdex cli, For an Alice trade, if Alicepayment is made and deposit payment is made. What can prevent Alice from claiming the bob payment.  I am running swapstaus but that doesn‚Äôt seem to wrap it up.

[05-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Sorry for slow response @Hermes , I am having problems with ETH and BTX wallets, but those are secondary issues...main issue is that a while back I put two  orders for Utrum, both for 350 OOT through BarterDEX, both orders went through, but I only have 350 OOT in my wallet.  On top of all this my trade history is absent from BarterDEX.

[05-Aug-18 02:51 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
But in trade history previously there were two separate transactions for 350 00T each.

[05-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
So I guess is there a way to recover trade history?

[05-Aug-18 02:58 AM] tolken#2655
Should be found in the DB/SWAPS dir

[05-Aug-18 03:00 AM] tolken#2655
I can‚Äôt recall off hand exactly where this is stored  on GUI version, but trade history should be there  in a raw form

[05-Aug-18 03:02 AM] tolken#2655
What‚Äôs likely going to happen is that after a while, you will see whatever you paid with returned to you. So if you bought with kmd, BarterDex will reclaim your alice payment after the contract releases the funds.

[05-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Thank you, restored my trade history.  I had a backup folder.  Assuming the funds were released, any idea where the refund would be posted?

[05-Aug-18 03:10 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Also, I am trying to start up Bitcore within BarterDEX and it won't let me start it in Native mode, keeps saying no valid wallet found even though it is running separately.  Says to doublecheck the RPC settings.  Don't know what to set those to, assuming that is the problem.

[05-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Hermes#6934
You have the latest version of Barterdex 1.1.1?

[05-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
1.1.0.

[05-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Lemme update

[05-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Running 1.1.1 now

[05-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Still getting the error around BTX and when I try and enable ETH in Native mode nothing happens;

[05-Aug-18 03:44 AM] Hermes#6934
ok can you post the .conf file here or in a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com in order to see if there is something that be missing.

[05-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Yah, is it in the main BarterDEX folder in Appdata?

[05-Aug-18 04:21 AM] Hermes#6934
not really it would be in the coin folder located in appdata

[05-Aug-18 04:21 AM] Hermes#6934
for BTX

[05-Aug-18 04:40 AM] Nabob#5004
dm me conf file content @Cryptoraptor

[05-Aug-18 11:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
A question about barterdex: let's say I want to sell 1 BTC against KMD. I send 1 BTC, 1.2 BTC and 1/777 BTC so I have 3 UTXOs. If I place my order to sell 1 BTC, "Max UTXO size" will not show "1" as I could expect, but the equivalent in KMD (5k KMD more or less, depending of the price I want to sell my BTC for KMD).

[05-Aug-18 03:07 PM] cipi#4502
if you place a BTC/KMD ask, the values are shown in KMD, so a potential buyer (using KMD) knows which value he could use in the buy-call

[05-Aug-18 06:29 PM] zatJUM#9924
yes, but perhaps he could also knows he wants to "buy 1 BTC", rather than "spend 5000 KMD"

[05-Aug-18 09:04 PM] cipi#4502
yes, but the buy call takes relvolume as parameter, like this: `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"buy\",\"base\":\"OOT\",\"rel\":\"KMD\",\"relvolume\":1,\"price\":0.03}"`

[05-Aug-18 09:06 PM] cipi#4502
so if i want to know what relvolume i could pass, so that the buy-call works, i need this value

[06-Aug-18 02:04 AM] Cryptoraptor#4893
Okay, so it turns out I did not have a conf file in my BTX folder.  I used the defaults for RPC and created one.  Syncing just fine now.  Now  I  will work on the Ethereum issue!

[06-Aug-18 03:02 AM] stringfeatus#2614
