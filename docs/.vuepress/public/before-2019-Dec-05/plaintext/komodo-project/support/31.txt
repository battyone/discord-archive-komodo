it's confirmed tx.

[01-Sep-18 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it must show there in barterdex jus fine

[01-Sep-18 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
confirm your address is correct for whichever passphrase you are using to login to it.

[01-Sep-18 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if using SPV, then may be something to do with SPV not reflecting expected result ü§î

[01-Sep-18 09:29 AM] house#8741
Yep spv

[01-Sep-18 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's all I can say so far

[01-Sep-18 09:30 AM] house#8741
Yeah all seams correct (addy) just has not shown up

[01-Sep-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if address is correct which you can see reflecting from your passphrase, then in any case you shouldn't worry.
for SPV may be @cipi @cipi can help

[01-Sep-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or a support person here can guide you to get the privkey of your address which you can use in your native BTCP wallet.

Thanks @cipi  is no major issue for me since was just fork coins, but want to be sure that we have explanation for noobs since they will not be so forgiving.

Hi, i just downloaded the latest agama wallet, put my seed in , but it is not showing my balance, anyone know why this is the case?

[01-Sep-18 04:43 PM] SHossain#0007
@Crypshotta What is your address? Have you checked your address in explorer ( https://kmdexplorer.io/ )? Which version Agama you are using? What OS?

There's  good chance you may have entered the wrong seed which will give you a different address, so that may be the first thing to check.

[01-Sep-18 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@yorklab based on his address and usage, it seems native mode were used for claiming reward. and, each time the reward and main fund went to a new change address. the user is now in a process of starting native mode and sync chain fully.

@SHossain hey man, i just got done with the first vps

[02-Sep-18 12:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
now when i log into the 2nd vps do i have to create a new user of can i use same user from vps 1

[02-Sep-18 12:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
im follwoing the steps for creating assett chain

[02-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Hermes#6934
User name for the vps?

[02-Sep-18 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[02-Sep-18 12:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
so im building komodo on both of my VPS servers...i just got done with the first VPS and now i have to do the same for the second vps

[02-Sep-18 12:32 AM] Hermes#6934
I don‚Äôt see any reference for it needing to have the same user and password for both nodes

[02-Sep-18 12:32 AM] Hermes#6934
You are using this guide right ?

using this one

[02-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok so ill just do it again with different user and password

[02-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
i think the username should be the same

[02-Sep-18 12:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
isnt that the whole point?

[02-Sep-18 12:48 AM] Hermes#6934
We haven‚Äôt added this to the guide for some reason , some vps don‚Äôt allow a change of the username and password , I think that the connection has to be made by the IP address

[02-Sep-18 12:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
man the support here isnt as great as advertised

[02-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
?

[02-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
its a different vps i can do whatever i want to it

[02-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
i already changed the first vps

[02-Sep-18 12:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
now im building komodo on 2nd vps but i ahev to decide what the username and password will be

[02-Sep-18 12:50 AM] Hermes#6934
A cool well from my point of view you can try using the same user name and password it shouldn‚Äôt affect , there is no reflection in the guide that states that this will make a difference .

[02-Sep-18 12:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
have you built an asset chain before?

[02-Sep-18 12:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
i feel that im just not sure and this could nbe important

[02-Sep-18 12:51 AM] Hermes#6934
Not really I was going to but I am pretty sure that is something that if it was important would have been written in the guide

[02-Sep-18 12:55 AM] Hermes#6934
rpcuser and rpcpassowrd can be different. doesn't matter but for security is always better to have different passwords and usernames

[02-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Hermes#6934
And vps can be different also that is not a requirement for it to be working

[02-Sep-18 12:59 AM] Hermes#6934
And also just to follow up , you will need to do the same exact commands of the first vps into the second vps to start the assetchain

[02-Sep-18 01:08 AM] Nabob#5004
@Deleted User  can you post here, which command you triggered on vps 1,  and the user name you are reffering to? is it asset chain name or komodo daemon username ?

[02-Sep-18 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
im not there yet

[02-Sep-18 02:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
im still building komodo on my vps

[02-Sep-18 02:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
i was just wondering if i need to use the same username

[02-Sep-18 02:06 AM] Nabob#5004
no need

[02-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[02-Sep-18 03:56 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Deleted User saying something like "man the support here isnt as great as advertised" is not going to help anybody, in fact it might repel those who wants to help you.  It's better to suggest improvement or give constructive criticism , Cheers

This guide has more useful information about the other asset chain parameters https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/assetchain-params.html. 
After that guide there is another one with example of asset chains

[02-Sep-18 09:46 AM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User i feel you have been trolling for few days. there is nothing wrong with our support or guides. you need training or education, not support.

[02-Sep-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the fact is someone that doesnt understand ssh and user accounts for unix, shouldnt complain about our support, they should be reading "ssh for newbies" and things like that. we cant be expected to have everything work for everyone, regardless of their knowledge. it is assumed that basic unix is known by someone in a project trying to launch a new chain

[02-Sep-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the alternative is to fork some other coin, make source code changes correctly and then do all the runtime fork stuff that is needed

[02-Sep-18 09:52 AM] SHossain#0007

i think to refer to service providers if they dont have the required skills. it is just "running with scissors" to have people not able to do very basic command line trying to launch assetchains

[02-Sep-18 09:53 AM] SHossain#0007
and complaing that road isn't smooth for him

[02-Sep-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can make some page with helpful links for someone without any unix experience so they can at least know what they need to know. any competent advanced user from any os, would be able to learn what is needed, given the study materials

[02-Sep-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you notice a distinct lack of understanding,just keep referring to the newbie study materials. only after they are able to know up from down in the ssh world, should they even attempt to start assetchains. after all it is just a matter to launch komodod with the right set of parameters on two different nodes. if that is beyond someone, then no amount of support will suffice and only lead to complaints about bad support. so we shouldnt even try to support people without the skills to launch assetchains. they need to use service providers or learn first.

[02-Sep-18 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I recommend to look into LPIC preparation courses - it's a fastest way to play a little with both Debian and RHEL and understand what's going on if not using it in everyday life. There is a little of everything in one place so it's easy for kick-off. 
And usually in such courses study how to use `man` what's is the most important üòÉ

[02-Sep-18 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
And would be cool to pass this computer science course in parallel in my opinion :trollface: : https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x There is C using for explanation/labs so it's giving more points for diving into komodo. And it's free!

When I want to use Jumblr. What are the costs? On average 0,15 % or 0,3 %?

[02-Sep-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
0.15% to get it into zspace, another 0.15% to get it out

[02-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the longer it stays in z form, the more privacy

[02-Sep-18 10:41 AM] Seko#7408
Ok ... the complete anonymous transaction chain 0.3% ...

[02-Sep-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
to do a round trip back to transparent, yes

[02-Sep-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
less than one month's worth of reward, so one way to view it is that the rewards will pay for jumblr

[02-Sep-18 10:44 AM] Seko#7408
Thx for the fast response...I‚Äòm writing now about Jumblr for the native German speakers...It will be released on the official Komodo channel on medium, I hope...
