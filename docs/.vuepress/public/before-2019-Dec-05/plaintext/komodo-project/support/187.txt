Firmware 1.6.0

[17-Nov-19 08:41 PM] riseandfall#3726
I'll try again but I fear it doesn't work for me

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Acura#2748
I had read from another user in Telegram that he also using the new Ledger Firmware 1.6 and can¬¥t claim Rewards

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] riseandfall#3726
I'm even not claiming...just want to do a simple tx

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Acura#2748
You are using the tool from lukeChild ?

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Acura#2748
ah ok

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] riseandfall#3726
I'll try again

[17-Nov-19 08:43 PM] riseandfall#3726
But does agama accept 24 words seed + 1 additional custom word ?

[17-Nov-19 08:43 PM] Acura#2748
Did you had tryit Magnumwallet ?

[17-Nov-19 08:43 PM] riseandfall#3726
No I was not aware about this wallet

[17-Nov-19 08:43 PM] riseandfall#3726
Let me check

Magnum Wallet

[17-Nov-19 08:44 PM] Oszy#5734
@riseandfall  not  100% sure but Ledger might be updating the KMD wallet, that's why it fails? 
Ledger seed is not compatible with Agama afaik

[17-Nov-19 08:45 PM] Oszy#5734
you could expose your private key for the address but that is very much NOT recommended

[17-Nov-19 08:46 PM] riseandfall#3726
@Oszy  : in Agama wallet you can well enter the ledger seed....but a standard one only maybe...not sur they support additional passphrase

[17-Nov-19 08:46 PM] riseandfall#3726
But the good piece of news is that Magnum Wallet does

[17-Nov-19 08:46 PM] Oszy#5734

Ledger Status
This page shows the status of all Ledger services.  Cryptocurrencies supported by third parties (such as EOS, Stellar, TRON, etc.) are not operated by Ledger and therefore not shown on this page.

[17-Nov-19 08:46 PM] Oszy#5734
looks like KMD is okay

[17-Nov-19 08:47 PM] riseandfall#3726
But I will not enter my seed into Magnum Wallet website...

[17-Nov-19 08:47 PM] riseandfall#3726
I'll check with Magnum Wallet

[17-Nov-19 08:48 PM] Acura#2748
You only need to choose Ledger on the Login menu

[17-Nov-19 08:52 PM] riseandfall#3726
Yes this is what I did

[17-Nov-19 08:53 PM] riseandfall#3726
You'll get a feedback within 1 hour

[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] riseandfall#3726
Even with Magnum Wallet it doesn't work

[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] riseandfall#3726
My ledger is unable to process the unlocking script I guess

[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] riseandfall#3726
The only solution I would have is that Agama can well accept 24 + 1 seed.

[17-Nov-19 09:06 PM] riseandfall#3726
I guess only pbca knows that

[17-Nov-19 09:06 PM] Acura#2748
strange, on my ledger i have kmd app version 1.3.13

[17-Nov-19 09:06 PM] Oszy#5734
Verus  devs really it‚Äôs not a Komodo project anymore

[17-Nov-19 09:07 PM] riseandfall#3726
Another solution would be that I reprocess by myself everything from the ledger seed to a KMD private keys

[17-Nov-19 09:08 PM] riseandfall#3726
It would be quite complicated and would require several hours on it

[17-Nov-19 09:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
So either Agama includes this feature or I'm in the shit

[17-Nov-19 09:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
Maybe it is Verus now but pbca coded this feature... probability he is able to answer precisely is much bigger

[17-Nov-19 09:10 PM] Oszy#5734
It would be great to know why exactly your transactions fails

[17-Nov-19 09:11 PM] Oszy#5734
Any amount fails? Even 1 kmd?

[17-Nov-19 09:12 PM] riseandfall#3726
Yes ...it's not linked with the amount...

[17-Nov-19 09:12 PM] Oszy#5734
Okay just asking

[17-Nov-19 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ledger can be updating their spv servers to new wallets

[17-Nov-19 09:12 PM] riseandfall#3726
Probability is low...I know people who don't have issue at all

[17-Nov-19 09:13 PM] riseandfall#3726
The KMD locked are one year old

[17-Nov-19 09:13 PM] Oszy#5734
It‚Äôs what I was thinking. Let me try to send kmd from my one. Gimme a minute

[17-Nov-19 09:13 PM] riseandfall#3726
KMD never asked users to convert to new addresses format ?

[17-Nov-19 09:14 PM] riseandfall#3726
As far as I know o was not concerned with the hack that occured with someone inserted a fake lib in Agama

[17-Nov-19 09:14 PM] riseandfall#3726
During the time window of the attack I didn't do any tx

[17-Nov-19 09:14 PM] riseandfall#3726
Thanks @Oszy

[17-Nov-19 09:15 PM] riseandfall#3726
I'll smoke a cigarette in the meantime üòâ

[17-Nov-19 09:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ledger wasnt affected by hack

{Reactions}
‚òë 

[17-Nov-19 09:15 PM] Oszy#5734
Just send 1 kmd, no issue here. v1.3.13

[17-Nov-19 09:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He‚Äôs on .16

[17-Nov-19 09:16 PM] riseandfall#3726
Don't mix firmware version and app version

[17-Nov-19 09:16 PM] riseandfall#3726
On ledger wallet

[17-Nov-19 09:16 PM] riseandfall#3726
So the issue is clear : my ledger fails to generate the unlocking script

[17-Nov-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
> I we'll have the last version now : 1.3.16

[17-Nov-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is what you said above

[17-Nov-19 09:17 PM] riseandfall#3726
Everything is updated

[17-Nov-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So maybe the .16 version is the problem as @Oszy not having issues with .13?

[17-Nov-19 09:18 PM] riseandfall#3726
No Oscy succeeded with maybe an older app version but some other users I know don't have issue

[17-Nov-19 09:19 PM] riseandfall#3726
So I'll ping publicly pbca and ask if agama offer this feature

[17-Nov-19 09:19 PM] riseandfall#3726
@pbca26

[17-Nov-19 09:20 PM] riseandfall#3726
Does agama seed import feature support 24words seed + 1 word passphrase ?

[17-Nov-19 09:20 PM] riseandfall#3726
In other words, can I enter in Agama a 25 (24 + 1) ledger seed ?

[17-Nov-19 09:21 PM] riseandfall#3726
Waiting for the answer...if he answers me ü§û

[17-Nov-19 09:21 PM] riseandfall#3726
Thanks for your help all of you

[17-Nov-19 09:21 PM] riseandfall#3726
Bye üòâ

[17-Nov-19 09:23 PM] Acura#2748
I think yes, but it is a immense risk

[17-Nov-19 09:24 PM] Acura#2748
Agama - Settings- BIP39 Keys

[17-Nov-19 10:01 PM] Arno#3334
@Oszy Ok, I'll wait a bit more, but there is not "unlock funds" button anywhere. It's been more than 8 hours now.

Can you check this please

[18-Nov-19 02:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@Arno hey, can you send me the b address in a DM ?

[18-Nov-19 02:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@riseandfall agama wallet may not be able to deal with the extra bip39 passphrase

you can use this page: <https://iancoleman.io/bip39/>
visit the page and then disconnect the internet before entering your seed words and passphrase, select the coin as KMD and scroll down to the bottom
you should see your ledger addresses and private keys
select the address with your coins and copy the private key

login to Agama directly using privatekey <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>

after doing all this and making the required transaction, you should create a new ledger seed and transfer your coins there to revert to the previous level of security

@mani 
> the Agama Windows v0.5.9-2 is better than Agama Windows v0.6.0-13 PBaaS cross-chain technology preview is that right?
yes

[18-Nov-19 02:42 AM] gcharang#6833
@Arno the b address is not controlled by anyone other than yourself and the person you are trading with
it is like a basic smart contract
the coins there can be moved by your trading partner; but doing so will expose the secret you need to move his coins that are being traded
or by you after a certain lock period is over
this is all done automatically by the app; some times, a button called "unlock funds" will appear, that has to be clicked

[18-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Hey guys, I still have the old agama wallet.. it no longer functions

[18-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
how do i switch to the verus version?

[18-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
will firing up the verus version overwrite all my wallet.dat files from my old agama wallet?

[18-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Just want to make sure I dont mess anything up here

[18-Nov-19 03:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@Sdunbar it won't overwrite anything
do you use native or lite mode?

[18-Nov-19 03:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
native

[18-Nov-19 03:11 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, first backup your wallet.dat and just install the latest verus Agama wallet
you might need to do this: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024513-how-to-resync-your-komodo-blockchain-from-scratch-windows-linux-osx->
if you are on a fork

[18-Nov-19 03:15 AM] Sdunbar#5064
alright will do that

[18-Nov-19 03:15 AM] Sdunbar#5064
whats next after that?

[18-Nov-19 03:17 AM] gcharang#6833
that is it
it should work as expected

[18-Nov-19 03:17 AM] Sdunbar#5064
don't need to move the wallet.dat file from old folder?

[18-Nov-19 03:17 AM] Sdunbar#5064
it uses the same directory?

[18-Nov-19 03:22 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, it uses the same directory
@Sdunbar 
but please backit up before reinstalling the wallet

[18-Nov-19 03:26 AM] Sdunbar#5064
yep backed it up just in case

[18-Nov-19 03:27 AM] Sdunbar#5064
probably should have backed up all the asset coins too but i dont have many of those

{Reactions}
üëç 

[18-Nov-19 03:32 AM] Sdunbar#5064
hmmm not sure if its syncing

[18-Nov-19 03:32 AM] Sdunbar#5064
does that mean im likely on a fork?

[18-Nov-19 03:32 AM] gcharang#6833
are the blocks not increasing?

[18-Nov-19 03:33 AM] gcharang#6833
if yes, you might be on a fork
easiest way to resolve is to use the bootstrap
 bootstraps are available here: <https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php>

[18-Nov-19 03:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah no increase in blocks

[18-Nov-19 03:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
