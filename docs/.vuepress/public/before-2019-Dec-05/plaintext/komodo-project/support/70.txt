How to find out resync  progress in agama wallet?

[22-Jan-19 01:49 PM] chocko#8664
it will be good to have a progress bar

[22-Jan-19 01:50 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a progress bar on the "Transactions" page

[22-Jan-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Also you can check the "Blocks" param on the "Information" page (have to press "I" icon)

We have to move KMD out Z... wallet? How about my Kmd on Bittrex and Coinomi?

[22-Jan-19 05:02 PM] longdo#9167
Do i need to do any thing?

[22-Jan-19 05:04 PM] SHossain#0007
If you have KMD in Bittrex and Coinomi, they are fine. If you have KMD in z address, please move them to a transparent R address.

[22-Jan-19 05:51 PM] chocko#8664
what's the reason to move it foromz adrr?

Hi smk üëã
Thanks

[23-Jan-19 12:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Is it enough to just rm -rf komodo?

[23-Jan-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you'd still have the data etc in ~/.komodo

[23-Jan-19 12:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
back up your wallet.dat!

[23-Jan-19 12:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF if you mean only the source dir, yes. just use `rm -rf komodo` and clone again to start fresh

[23-Jan-19 12:21 PM] SHossain#0007
and, if you want to remove data dir and you funds in there follow what @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator said

[23-Jan-19 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I'm asking for someone else.  Their komodod doesn't seem to be there.
I usually just rm -rf and try again.  Don't want to mess things up for someone else though, haha.

[23-Jan-19 12:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks guys!

[23-Jan-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
rm  -rf is good

i have general question about my servers, i have 3 computers 2 of them in my room and other one is another city and connected another network of course it has static ip , i use them as linux server to test chains.. i control them using teamviewer.. the problem is i can not connect to chain the machine that is not inside my local network, i tried to find ip from ifconfig and whatismyip.com where can i find ip to connect or what should i do.?

[24-Jan-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
check your firewall on server and local network

[24-Jan-19 04:05 PM] SlhCn#0104
@SHossain  thanks for answer, both of them disabled, but again it says connection refused.?

[24-Jan-19 04:06 PM] SlhCn#0104
i tried to connect using ssh..

[24-Jan-19 04:07 PM] SHossain#0007
did you get connection refused for ssh connection or debug.log?

[24-Jan-19 04:11 PM] SlhCn#0104
i am not sure about debug.log but i got connection refused for ssh..

[24-Jan-19 04:12 PM] SlhCn#0104
ssh server is running btw..

[24-Jan-19 04:23 PM] SHossain#0007
then, you need to troubleshoot your ssh connection. not sure what have done with that without much info

[24-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I can try deleting all blocks and trying again.

[24-Jan-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
start with `./komodod -rescan &` see what happens

[24-Jan-19 05:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
k

[24-Jan-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
if didn't work, start with `./komodod -reindex &`

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
k, same error, trying next

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
reindex did the trick

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's hanging here though:

[24-Jan-19 05:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can try wiping and reinstalling

[24-Jan-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to wait for it to start up

[24-Jan-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
did you use `addressindex` in conf file?

[24-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

Yesterday, it hung here for 30 minutes while I was working on something else, but perhaps that error from before was the issue.

I did try to launch without making a komodo.conf file first, as I forgot. So that might have been the source of the initial error.

[24-Jan-19 05:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I just cp'ed what's in the instructions, and set a random user and psswd

[24-Jan-19 05:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

you can always check what is happening by tailing the debug.log

tail -f ~/.komodo/debug.log

ok

[24-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
looks like it still has the same issue

I can delete ~/komodo and reinstall from scratch?

[24-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It will take time, of course

[24-Jan-19 05:52 PM] SHossain#0007
try restarting your computer and see what happens before compiling from source

[24-Jan-19 05:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Just fyi:

I have a relatively fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.10.

This is my first time trying to install Komodo, and I have not yet ever had it working on this new installation.

[24-Jan-19 07:55 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have teamviewer on this test machine? i can try having a look remotely

[24-Jan-19 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
i built dev branch from fresh clone today and all worked fine on my end

[24-Jan-19 07:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok.

we'll play around with it later, once I'm done with this meeting. thank you!

[24-Jan-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
and, use Ubuntu 18.04 and stay on that as that is the LTS version and 18.10 is not. also, we didnt' test on Ubuntu 18.10

[24-Jan-19 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
actually, i tested Ubuntuy 18.10 and it works

[24-Jan-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus I'm downloading Pop OS to install and test if Komodo is runnig inside that

[24-Jan-19 09:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
you're awesome. thank you very much.

Don't stress too much.

I just tested the VPS and it's working great.

[24-Jan-19 10:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus your issue is related to PopOS itself. the OS comes with default `gcc version 8.2.0`. using gcc 7.3 makes Komodo work. use the following commands to fix the issue.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-7 g++-7
sudo rm /usr/bin/gcc && sudo rm /usr/bin/g++
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-7 /usr/bin/gcc
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/g++-7 /usr/bin/g++
cd ~/komodo
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
