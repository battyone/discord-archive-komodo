got a similar question, submitted the form today and had an uneasy feeling the c&p didn't paste correctly. Is there a way to verify the address i submitted before sending the confirming xact ?

[08-Jun-19 10:33 PM] orange sunshine#8588
or maybe a better question, if the address isn't valid will i be connected ?

[08-Jun-19 10:34 PM] orange sunshine#8588
contacted

[08-Jun-19 10:39 PM] gcharang#6833
@orange sunshine you will definitely be contacted if you address is not valid
you can also resubmit the form with correct address
if the first one and this are identical, no problem
if the first one is invalid and this is valid , the second one will be the recalim address

[08-Jun-19 10:40 PM] orange sunshine#8588
got it, thanks

[08-Jun-19 10:51 PM] orange sunshine#8588
ah, now i know why the address looked wrong when i submitted, the edit  box for the  address isn't long enough to show the whole address. So looks like it's truncated

A reminder: please do not give out your seed to anyone. Sometimes there are imposters posing as team members and admins asking for seeds, so be careful.

except im trying to stake

[09-Jun-19 01:50 AM] dante#7122
1. Generated new address 2. got the associated public key 3. set this public key using setpublickey method of komodo-cli

[09-Jun-19 02:11 AM] dante#7122
komodo-cli setgenerate true , shouldn't this command mine the genesis coins ?

[09-Jun-19 02:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`komodo-cli -ac_name=ACNAME setgenerate true 1`

[09-Jun-19 02:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
where ACNAME is the name of the assetchain you created

[09-Jun-19 02:15 AM] dante#7122
yes done that exact cmd with -ac_name

are you running two nodes? opened p2p ports?

[09-Jun-19 02:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
use `-addnode=IPADDRESS` when launching chains to link the nodes

[09-Jun-19 02:18 AM] dante#7122
yes two different windows machines, with ethernet connected to same network with link to other nodes while launching daemons

[09-Jun-19 02:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are you using the local IPs of each node for -addnode when launching?

[09-Jun-19 02:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can they ping each other?

[09-Jun-19 02:23 AM] dante#7122
yes check the ping thing before launching the nodes

[09-Jun-19 02:26 AM] dante#7122
ips, without any port numbers though. do we need to enter the port too ?

[09-Jun-19 02:27 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
windows home networks can be a struggle, many variations of setup and router config

Whenever an application wants to make itself accessible over the network, it claims a TCP/IP port, which means that port can‚Äôt be used by anything else. So how do you check open ports to see what application is already using it?

Oh , I just saw my second machines  daemon process windows its doing some process. says <MYCHAINNAME> vouts.1 mining. xx vs xxx

[09-Jun-19 02:31 AM] dante#7122
and its increasing

[09-Jun-19 02:32 AM] dante#7122
Pretty new to the tech. Will i get the coins once this process finishes ? @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator

[09-Jun-19 02:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
use `komodo-cli -ac_name=ACNAME getblockcount`

[09-Jun-19 02:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if  returns >  0, genesis block has been mined

[09-Jun-19 02:37 AM] dante#7122
yes I got it now. Finally ! Thanks @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator . Will try transferring some to first node now

[09-Jun-19 05:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the only way you can send your kmd is that the wallet has to connect to internet to broadcast the txid

[09-Jun-19 05:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
no idea how you can send txid offline
