How does one load their wallet.dat from a portable version

[12-Dec-18 07:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it should load automatically , i would think

[12-Dec-18 07:32 AM] 🚀📈edsky📉🤯#2695

[12-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[12-Dec-18 07:33 AM] 🚀📈edsky📉🤯#2695

[12-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, it's slower than previous version

[12-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
just wait a little longer than usual, and it should be running fine

[14-Dec-18 03:24 AM] Nabob#5004
@ABP brewmaster check marketmaker is running and grep port is listening

`ps -ef | grep marketmaker`

posted a help with wallet in support-wallet channel...anyone home who can help?

[14-Dec-18 09:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
oki - just to be sure for those that have a knack for doing things the wrong way: 🐫 
Agama0.3.1d is for all Komodo, including ARRR, correct?
since ARRR is by default z-address, my ARRR need to go to a new address, correct?
now the big question:
Do I need to move my KMD, BET, SUPERNET, DEX, and all the other assets to new addresses too?
this is an important Q that makes me a bit insecure

[14-Dec-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
only sprout addresses (starting with zc) need to be zmigrated to sapling addresses (starting with zs)

[14-Dec-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you manually did zaddr with the non-PIRATE chains, there is nothing that needs to be moved

[14-Dec-18 01:14 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok regarding electrum servers is something going to break ?

[14-Dec-18 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
Use sapling enabled updated electrum source.

[14-Dec-18 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007

Upcoming Komodo service disruption
Ledger will suspend its Komodo service on December 14th, 2018 in order to evaluate the feasibility of technical upgrades for the Komodo hard fork on December 15th. KMD users may transfer their KMD ...

[14-Dec-18 04:01 PM] farl#9964
@Acura "Ledger will suspend its Komodo service on December 14th"

[14-Dec-18 04:01 PM] Acura#2748
Did you already checked if it suspended?

[14-Dec-18 04:02 PM] farl#9964
Too late...

[14-Dec-18 04:02 PM] farl#9964
Yes, it's suspended in the Ledger Live. There is an alert 😦

[14-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Angelos | Coinomi Wallet#6729
But not in Coinomi. And won't be, even for a day.

[14-Dec-18 04:03 PM] Angelos | Coinomi Wallet#6729
So, we'd appreciate a mention in your FAQs

[14-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Angelos | Coinomi Wallet#6729
You  think thats reasonable and possible?

[14-Dec-18 04:05 PM] Angelos | Coinomi Wallet#6729

The only thing remaining for Coinomi now is the nlocktime feature for the rewards (we're telling our users how to link to agama to do it up to now, but I think its time for that too! 😃

[14-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Angelos | Coinomi Wallet#6729
Nice, thanks.

[14-Dec-18 04:13 PM] SHossain#0007
@Angelos | Coinomi Wallet BTW, we have even better solution if users want to do it safely using Agama. We implemented a new feature **Offline transaction signing** using Agama. Any user can use it securely to claim reward. If you need any help to understand how our reward works, you can ask in #dev-rewards channel. Our devs will be more than happy to answer your questions.
