[26-Jun-18 02:28 PM] gcharang#6833
```
When you open the app is the first screen you see the login screen or the screen to activate a coin/pick between native and spv? If it's a login screen sign in like you did before then do a complete logout
```

@sœÜldat this version is recalled. It's issues are being worked on.

[26-Jun-18 02:44 PM] Hermes#6934
@Shinsoo I think that you should also send a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com with the complete information and screenshot in order to review it properly over here is not so easy...

[26-Jun-18 02:44 PM] sœÜldat#8733
@gcharang ok thanks

[26-Jun-18 02:45 PM] Hermes#6934
We have been seeing this issues being presented but a pin shouldn‚Äôt take you to a different address make sure you file the ticket in order to review this case .

[26-Jun-18 02:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@Shinsoo  maybe you have two pin files stored in your Agama, and you are logging in to a different one? Please  click on the name below `Pin/password access` to see if you have another seed stored

[26-Jun-18 02:58 PM] Shinsoo#0021
@Hermes yes i hav done it. i just keep getting " check spaces before and after" advices

[26-Jun-18 02:59 PM] Hermes#6934
Yep that can be also a possible scenario  ,

[26-Jun-18 02:59 PM] Hermes#6934
One last Q did you double checked the seed or pin sent you to the correct address before sending the funds ?

[26-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Shinsoo#0021
yes i loged out and loged in with pin and seed once each

[26-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Shinsoo#0021
then I send komodo fund

[26-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Hermes#6934
Sometimes when you use a new seed or create a new wallet it‚Äôs good to check at least 3 times in order to confirm that you are getting the same address

[26-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Hermes#6934
I say 3 times because sometimes user errors can happen

[26-Jun-18 03:00 PM] Hermes#6934
And I don‚Äôt trust even myself sometimes

[26-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Hermes#6934
And I double and triple check

[26-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Hermes#6934
The seed

[26-Jun-18 03:05 PM] Shinsoo#0021
@Hermes i write to komodo support with all pics.

[26-Jun-18 03:06 PM] Shinsoo#0021

will everything be fine? I'm worried about it

üò¶

[26-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Hermes#6934
yep you will be fine, you can use the same seed of your Agama wallet in Hyperdex and Barterdex and should be able to see your funds

[26-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Hermes#6934
that's the advantage of having your seed üòé

[26-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Hermes#6934
you can use any of our other dapps and you should be able to manage your funds

[26-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Hermes#6934
not really you cannot claim the reward for now but you can manage your funds while we push a new release of the wallet, you will only need a 64 bit PC in order to run hyper or barter dex

[27-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Hermes#6934
everyone everyone We have new Agama build v41 https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
This new version release changelog:

* Fixed settings save bug that got socket timeout param broken
* Updated asset explorers to point to *.kmdexplorer.io
* ZILLA coin added.
* Fixes the recent SPV connectivity issues

Direct Links:
Linux: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-installer.zip
macOS: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-osx-installer.zip
Windows: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-windows-installer.zip
Linux Portable: https://agama.komodoplatform.com/file/supernet/files/AgamaApp-0.2.41-beta-linux-portable.zip

After installing the new version, if you are still facing connectivity issues in lite mode, make sure to delete the local userdata stored by previous versions of Agama before following the SPV connectivity issues guide on confluence.

This can be done by reset settings from settings. If resetting does not work, please remove the `config.json` file manually.

Data to be deleted: 
Please don't delete the whole `Agama` data directory as the dir contains your encrypted seeds
* Ubuntu: Delete `~/.agama/config.json 
* MacOS: Delete `config.json` file from ~/Library/Application\ Support/Agama dir
* Windows: Delete `config.json` file from C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Agama\ dir

When you change an entry in the `Settings` and save it, for it to take effect: 

* Click `Complete Logout` from the Top Menu
* Close Agama
* Open Agama again and login with your required Coins.

Now the previously saved settings will be effective.

So @Hermes , You're saying to use Agama, with my barterdex seed, to transfer the funds?   Im not sure if I am understanding you correctly.

reference post:

yes you can do this procedure if you have your seed you should be able to manage your funds with Agama , Barterdex and Hyperdex

[27-Jun-18 06:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I'll give it a go when I DL the new agama wallet.  Thank you.
