I tried updating from source, but was having issues with the above.

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] phm87#7395
RICK params changed I think

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh...

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] phm87#7395
``./komodod -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_staked=10 -addnode=95.217.44.58 -addnode=138.201.136.145 &``

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I deleted all source installs, and am working on prebuilt binary now

[21-Nov-19 10:17 PM] phm87#7395
Did you use these params ? (I'm not sure that params changed but the chain was reset)

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, that's identical

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But, maybe my blockchain is out of date...

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] phm87#7395
which komodo repo and which branch are you using ?

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
dev

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
well

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
now I'm using prebuilt binaries

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] phm87#7395
I'm using beta everywhere

[21-Nov-19 10:18 PM] phm87#7395
(and kmdlabs repo for LABS of course)

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] phm87#7395
are you a new team member ?

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've been with Komodo for 2 years.

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] phm87#7395
Oh sorry, I don't know all KMD team members yet

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's fine

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nice to meet you

[21-Nov-19 10:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't know everyone, either

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
I'm a new NN op from this season, I'm less than 1 year in KMD but since 2017 in yiimp pools

💯 labs 

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
cool

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
Nice to meet you

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yep u2

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] phm87#7395
and sorry for my question

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no need to apologize

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, about RICK... are you a support team person, as well?

[21-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
or just volunteering?

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
don't want to keep you here, if you were just popping in briefly

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
so about komodo binary, I'd recommend beta and build it yourself, make sure to install all required dependancies

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did that originally, but you can see the error message above

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
won't build

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hence the binaries

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
No I am not support team, I saw your messages then I tried to help

[21-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ahh, thank you very much

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think there's something about a CC installation I have somewhere that's blocking something...

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
If you are sure that you installed all dependancies, maybe you can try the build 2 or 3 times, I know it sound weird but there is a build bug that can be work around like this

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
but the bug I'm talking about is not into CC

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I've tried that

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's what we usually do.

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I tried 3 times, and then switched to binaries.

[21-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
maybe I should have tried more

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
RICK launches. It just won't sync.

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] SHossain#0007
delete your current RICK data dir completely and start the chain again

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] phm87#7395
a guy had a similar error here https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/594906735467036682/606056041075048452

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
k, trying that

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] phm87#7395
wierd that it doesn't work for you

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] SHossain#0007
you have old RICK chain db in your data dir. params changed. it won't sync

[21-Nov-19 10:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
perfect, it's syncing now

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thank you

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I only did the old method

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
and for your compile error, you need to issue `./zcutil/build.sh -j4` 2-3 more times

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
of deleting select files

[21-Nov-19 10:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, good to know

[21-Nov-19 10:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can just do the binaries, for now, and come back to this later

[21-Nov-19 10:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
much appreciated

[21-Nov-19 10:25 PM] SHossain#0007

Is there any upgrade of the mainnet recently?

[22-Nov-19 03:10 AM] Regnar#6164
Mainnet running fine. There's an upgrade coming later this month that exchanges are disabling wallets in preparation for, but the chain is running fine

[22-Nov-19 03:50 AM] blockchain_ocean#7152
Thanks.

[23-Nov-19 08:34 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Komodo-team, I have an atomic swap that timed out. I tried to swap LTC to KMD. Now it seems to be ‘reserved’, so I cannot use my LTC to try again. Any tips, tricks to get my LTC back? Thank you in advance.

[23-Nov-19 08:38 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
I used the AtomicDEX app of course 🙂

[23-Nov-19 10:16 AM] B3n#2876
hello, i have filled the komodo refund form now 2 times out when i receive my komodo back its need very long what i make wrong? or what you make wrong komodo team? E-Mail ben79hh@yahoo.de

[23-Nov-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
@Cryptakumi wait for about 4-5 hours and it will come back.

[23-Nov-19 10:58 AM] reoparker#0455
does coinex needs kyc to withdraw to kmd?

[23-Nov-19 10:59 AM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang can you have a look at @B3n 's refund

[23-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Ja oszy, thank you for your reply. It is already back but when I want to use it for a swap it says: reserved in a swap

[23-Nov-19 11:21 AM] cipi#4502
@reoparker you can withdraw 10000 USD per day on CoinEx without KYC

[23-Nov-19 11:22 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Actually it says: locked in a swap

[23-Nov-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptakumi Hello! Most probably one (or more) swaps still ongoing on your device at the moment and thats why AtomicDEX thinking that funds are locked. Are you on iOS or Android? If you're on iOS it might be worth to keep app screen enabled without switching to another app for a 10-15 minutes or so.

[23-Nov-19 11:26 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
I am on iOS

[23-Nov-19 11:26 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
But it has been locked now for already 2 days

[23-Nov-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please DM me the log from your application? (Settings -> Send log)

[23-Nov-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On iOS most probably that should be the case (swap kick-off and fast app closure) because app backend can't work in background on this OS yet

[23-Nov-19 11:27 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
I will, thanks! What is DM? Sorry I am new to discord 🙂

[23-Nov-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
DM = Direct message

[23-Nov-19 11:28 AM] Cryptakumi#6681
Oké thanks!

[23-Nov-19 03:42 PM] LocoMB#8593
I have a Q about updates:
I am running komodod built on my system (ubuntu)
version: 2001526
protocolversion: 170007
KMDversion: "0.4.0a"
as I understand there will be fork coming down the road, so will I be able to keep up by simply doing 'git pull' and build again?
Will the version I have stop working? 
Which channel to watch for the announcement? 
Thanks!

[23-Nov-19 03:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@LocoMB we will announce it in the #official📢 channel

<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/updating-from-source.html>

> Will the version I have stop working? 
yes, if you keep using the old version after the block the hard update gets activated, it will go on a fork

Question about the KMD rewards. If I have rewards accrued and send small transaction to some other address, what will happen to those rewards?

[23-Nov-19 08:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
the rewards will go back to your wallet if that utxo you spent accrued rewards

[23-Nov-19 08:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you use a fullnode most likely to a new address in your wallet

[23-Nov-19 08:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you use a mobile wallet or agama it goes back to your address

[23-Nov-19 09:01 PM] jukKas#1196
So they'll be as a reward waiting to be claimed or will be actually paid to the correct address?

[23-Nov-19 09:31 PM] Arno#3334
@CHMEX Just an addition: This automatic claiming when sending only works with wallets that support it (atomicDEX, Agama etc.). Making a transaction with the Ledger Nano S through the Ledger Live App doesn't collect the rewards at all, and they get lost.

[23-Nov-19 09:32 PM] Arno#3334
If in doubt: have a look at the actual fee in the transaction. If it's negative, the claiming worked, if it's positive, it didn't work.

[23-Nov-19 09:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you have a ledger you can claim rewards with atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

[23-Nov-19 09:34 PM] Arno#3334
Yes. I only wanted to point out the difference in regards to normal transactions between the wallets and the danger of losing the rewards.

[24-Nov-19 02:33 AM] gcharang#6833
> [2:31 AM] jukKas: So they'll be as a reward waiting to be claimed or will be actually paid to the correct address?
when you do any transaction from a wallet that supportt rewards, it will collect them to an address you own as soon as part of the transaction

[24-Nov-19 01:26 PM] KOSIUS#0001
There's literally no way to claim the 5% kmd reward with ledger nano s

[24-Nov-19 01:27 PM] KOSIUS#0001
you just get an error "ledger device is unavailable" because there's so many public keys to export and I guess it just times out

[24-Nov-19 01:27 PM] KOSIUS#0001
after this new ledger update

[24-Nov-19 01:27 PM] KOSIUS#0001
please tag me when answering with the solution

[24-Nov-19 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
#dev-rewards

[24-Nov-19 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is the channel to be I think

[24-Nov-19 05:23 PM] Arno#3334
@KOSIUS You could send your entire funds to the next empty address so that all the unspent funds of many addresses are collected onto one single new address. Then probably only one transaction has to be confirmed on the ledger nano s when you claim them. After collecting all funds onto one new address, you can also connect the ledger nano s to the magnumwallet and send, receive and claim your KMD / rewards from there as well.
