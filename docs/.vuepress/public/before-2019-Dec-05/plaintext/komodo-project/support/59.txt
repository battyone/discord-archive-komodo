@[Dev] Alex Are  you trying to send funds usinng z_sendmany from t address to t address ?

[05-Dec-18 01:47 PM] SHossain#0007
he wan't to shield

[05-Dec-18 01:49 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
@Nabob I send pool fee to z address

[05-Dec-18 01:51 PM] Nabob#5004
We assume you are on PIRATE chain,  To send mined funds you need to use `z_shieldcoinbase`  as @SHossain  said

[05-Dec-18 01:52 PM] SHossain#0007
instead of `"*"` you can use R address `"Rxxxx"` from where you want to shield.

[05-Dec-18 01:54 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
@SHossain  @Nabob thank you

[05-Dec-18 01:55 PM] [Dev] Alex#5249
@SHossain is komodo support sapling?

[05-Dec-18 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD supports sapling. it will be activated on 15th December

[05-Dec-18 07:41 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
For the 15th update, what version is needed to support sapling? Is it the current 0.2.43d that is on the website?

[05-Dec-18 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
new version will be released. hopefully by the end of this week

[05-Dec-18 07:46 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
So 43d is not the correct version?

[05-Dec-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> For now is the current version but when the update is made on the 15th we will be releasing a new version for all users :)

[05-Dec-18 07:52 PM] SwimedDragon#3996
Ok, thanks üòÉ

[05-Dec-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> the update on the wallet should be coming a few days before the December 15th so stay tuned to our webpage and discord...for the announcement.

[06-Dec-18 09:50 PM] axo777#1232
Trying to get komodod working on my new MacBook Pro but cannot find the command  to run the makeReleaseMac.sh script.  Help would be appreciated.  Thanx.

[06-Dec-18 09:58 PM] SHossain#0007
`./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`

[06-Dec-18 10:02 PM] axo777#1232
Thanks. @SHossain   The Readme is not even close to that.

[06-Dec-18 10:03 PM] axo777#1232
" To build a distributable version of VerusCoin then run the makeReleaseMac.sh script after building. This will fix the dependency references and move the komodod and komodo-cli binaries to the kmd/mac/verus-cli directory along with the 6 libraries required for it to work properly."

[06-Dec-18 10:04 PM] axo777#1232
-bash: ./zcutil/build-mac.sh: No such file or directory

[06-Dec-18 10:07 PM] axo777#1232
Got it by dragging.  Thanks

[06-Dec-18 10:18 PM] SHossain#0007

[07-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cryptosid:matrix.org> but there is no windows installer anymore?

[07-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Hermes#6934
This version is still being tested...is not yet an official release...we will notify users when it's ready for it to be downloaded.

[07-Dec-18 11:49 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Got an error when using my WIF logging into the new RC, said incorrect format, but logged in anyway, would not show my balance, logged in with my seed phrase, no probolem, balance updated, rewards claimed, on a Win 7 Pro IBM Thinkcentre.

[07-Dec-18 11:50 PM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, even newer RC, let me get installed :facepalm:

[08-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Hermes#6934
You had this error with previous version 2.43d?

[08-Dec-18 12:27 AM] agnewpickens#7393
2.44

[08-Dec-18 12:27 AM] agnewpickens#7393
3.0 works fine

[08-Dec-18 12:28 AM] agnewpickens#7393

All good now

[08-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok for now 3.0 is still in testing mode just for you to be aware.

[08-Dec-18 12:39 AM] agnewpickens#7393
OK, well, I'll be careful.

Does anyone know  what's going on with the atomicexplorer.com API?

[08-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Shaf#5912
Hi, I hold KMD on an exchange. Should i put it in the wallet? I heard there is a hardfork of some sort?

[08-Dec-18 07:20 PM] Hermes#6934
@Shaf  Exchanges have already been notified to make the update but still if you have the possibility to use Agama you can do it. But still we are waiting for the release candidate to be officially available.  So just keep an eye for the coming update on our website and announcement channels .

[08-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Hermes#6934
It should be a few days before the 15th of December and just in case this is not a hard fork here is the complete new update list for this version  https://komodoplatform.com/upgrade-guide-dec-15/

No there won't be any type of different coin...all we remain the same...This update is mandatory for all exchanges  and providers.

[08-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Hermes#6934

Ok so when and where can we download the update for DEC 15, 2018? I have a pool but it is private but i need to update the wallet and the daemon on my server to keep mining, thanks

[09-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Hermes#6934
We will be releasing the wallet update  shortly right now we are testing the new binaries for komodod...will keep you posted on this updates  @skyguynca

[09-Dec-18 02:03 AM] skyguynca#0562
@Hermes  ok, thanks

[10-Dec-18 08:35 PM] zatJUM#9924
I've updated native kmd and it's very very, very long to "activate best chain".

[10-Dec-18 08:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
debug.log shows "2018-12-10 20:35:08 UpdateTip: new best=03145704f985c79450fa05779264384828caaf00c96571596e6d0bdc83b92764  height=33619  log2_work=20.2041"

and generaly komodod stops because RAM is not enough

[10-Dec-18 08:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
Wasn't sapling supposed to reduce ram and cpu needs?

[10-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Hermes#6934
Komodod will keep on loading and needing the same resources as usual...

[10-Dec-18 08:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
It has never needed so much time sync'ing from scratch for me

[10-Dec-18 08:39 PM] zatJUM#9924
On same vps

[10-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Hermes#6934
Here are some of the sapling improvements

[10-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Hermes#6934
Performance for shielded addresses
Payments involving the new Sapling z-addresses can be constructed in as little as a few seconds and with only 40 megabytes of memory.
Decoupled spend authority
Allows the hardware that constructs the zero-knowledge proof to be independent from the hardware that signs for the transaction.
Improved keys
Full viewing keys allow owners of shielded addresses the ability to view incoming and outgoing transaction details without exposing their private spending key.

[10-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Hermes#6934
Have you downloaded the latest version directly from our website?

[10-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Hermes#6934
I haven't seen any issues while testing...how many cores do your VPS has?

[10-Dec-18 08:40 PM] zatJUM#9924
```git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo```

[10-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Hermes#6934
you did a fresh installation right?   how much time has passed with this message  "activating best message" ?

[10-Dec-18 08:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
no it's an old one, but I deleted all inside ~/.komodo/

[10-Dec-18 08:44 PM] zatJUM#9924
"activating best chain" for hours

[10-Dec-18 08:45 PM] zatJUM#9924
vps with ssd but low cost one

[10-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Hermes#6934
that's a little odd no error message from komodod? do you have the complete new zcash params ? Also i guess you are in the dev branch right?

[10-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Hermes#6934
I haven't seen any issues with loading komodod for now ...

[10-Dec-18 08:55 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm on branch "master" and yes, it has downloaded new zcash params yesterday

[10-Dec-18 08:58 PM] zatJUM#9924
I only see ```UpdateTip: new best=00dee83177da9180c2a4f96a6200ed461e2d5f4bda716d4b3362806bae26cc1a  height=44244  log2_work=20.897332  log2_stake=-inf  tx=45017  date=2016-10-28 05:17:59 progress=0.007924  cache=10.8MiB(43754tx)``` lines in debug.log

one block a time

[10-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Hermes#6934
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html use this guide...I have used dev as showed in the guide and haven't seen any issues...I do have seen that depending on the resources it can take some time loading blocks and activating the best chain...but still it should be fairly quick it being in the CLI

[10-Dec-18 09:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
I've done this many times before on this vps with this distribution without any problem!

[10-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Hermes#6934
have you tried using the dev branch?

[10-Dec-18 09:11 PM] zatJUM#9924
no, I would like to have a stable node on this vps

[10-Dec-18 09:11 PM] zatJUM#9924
I'm gonna let it sync this night, let's see

[10-Dec-18 09:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
It's stopped once today while sync'ing, out of mem

hello all... just wondering if you guys have had any issues with airdrops not showing up?
i used to see a balance on chainzilla after the airdrop but it's been gone for some time. kept saying to myself it will come back on the next update but it hasn't after 2 updates now so i wanted to ask here after a colleague recommended getting some help here.

[11-Dec-18 01:53 PM] PTYX#6840
@nknarula are you on spv or native mode?

[11-Dec-18 08:42 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Hermes Back with my syncing problem with new komodod. Seems its RAM related, and with sapling it needs a little more RAM. I just enabled swap (4 Go) and run again komodod

[11-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Hermes#6934
hmm interesting

[11-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Hermes#6934
yes in some way in my other machines it took a little bit more than before to load as well
