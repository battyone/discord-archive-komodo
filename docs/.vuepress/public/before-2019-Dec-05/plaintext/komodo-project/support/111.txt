@csu check where is the final destination you fund ended up , if it's <https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF> then it's safe, the team control it

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Dom001#1832
were Pirate (ARRR) affected too? my balance at dexstats ist 0 and pirate still syncing...

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] kolo#1111
@flick yes, they are useless

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] TonyL#3577
@Dom001 No, PIRATE is not affected because it using native mode only

[05-Jun-19 03:39 PM] flick#6039
@kolo To transfer NINJA I have to login in Native Mode and wait for the whole chain to download (hours? days?), correct? Or is there any other way to transfer them?

[05-Jun-19 03:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Dom001 balance for pirate will show 0 on any explorer

[05-Jun-19 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
And you cant see balance on stats website because it's using Z transactions only

[05-Jun-19 03:40 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 03:40 PM] mrlynch#5735

[05-Jun-19 03:41 PM] shewy89#1464

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like maybe you are trying to send to a zaddr? You can only send to an R... address

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@costa2439 which address are you trying to send to?

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
CHIPS has BTC-style addresses

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] TS#6934
Hello. I do not know English. I have a KMD on AGAMA V0.3.5. Now I do not see the balance and transaction history. I checked here https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php, the coins are in place. What should I do to get access to the coins, to transfer them to another storage, to the stock exchange?

[05-Jun-19 03:44 PM] costa2439#3771
Is R

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@costa2439 chips doesn't have R.. addresses

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] costa2439#3771
Ahh

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] costa2439#3771
Ok

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] SadykovT#2123
A question.  I downloaded new Agama VRSC\ Activate coin KMD\ and got a new address. is it safe ? (Or should I Activate VRSC and send funds to this new address ?)

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TS make a new address in a new wallet. Send all funds to that new address. Leave no funds in Agama

[05-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
see pinned posts for details

[05-Jun-19 03:46 PM] costa2439#3771
I'm going to create a new address for chips, but I had them in an R

[05-Jun-19 03:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yes CHIPS address starts with R

[05-Jun-19 03:48 PM] PHBA2061#2530

[05-Jun-19 03:48 PM] TS#6934
@dukeleto I do not see inside the purse of coins. The send button is not active. No transaction history. This means that it is not possible to send coins!

[05-Jun-19 03:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@TS use https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview create a new seed there

Holy shit all my KMD is gone. This is the worst day ever

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@C Adi there is a recovery operation going, the team has sweeped 8 million KMD to get them safe.

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] CoinKing88#1540
You should get them back

[05-Jun-19 03:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@C Adi check explorer to see the address they ended up in

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CoinKing88 regarding Verus wallet:
install the wallet like you would any other wallet.
create a new wallet, select create 256bit seed (iguana)
write down seed carefully as you would have done with your previous wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Use the seed to log in, it will generate you a new R address

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
log out and log in again using the fresh seedphrase, check if the adress matches the one you generated earlier

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Keep seed and wallet adress close

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Log in to old wallet using your old (possibly compromised) seed and send your assets to the new address

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] C Adi#8432
RSgD2cmm3niFRu etc etc

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] C Adi#8432
Will do

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362

@K.M yes you can send KMD there

[05-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Zoroaster#5093
Anyone know why Verus Agama doesn‚Äôt give me the option to create a new seed? Is it because I previously ‚Äúimported key‚Äù into Agama?

[05-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Zoroaster#5093
If so how do I un-import key?

[05-Jun-19 04:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@Zoroaster first select VRSC litemode
then create wallet in next screen

[05-Jun-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362

thx

[05-Jun-19 04:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CoinKing88 there were two options you could check, was one of them still ticked on?

[05-Jun-19 04:15 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Cryptoon think the problem was having both agamas running at the same time. Trying again now with only verus running.

[05-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahaaa, that might as well be it!

[05-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can only run one at the same time

[05-Jun-19 04:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
