Hello everyone. I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction as far as written documentation concerning POS Staking on the KMD platform. It would be nice if it had examples too. IE What happens when staking off one input, vs the 64 input max. If there are split stake thresholds, etc. I suppose a document on UTXO's, SegID's, etc. would also help in trying to explain staking on KMD.

[03-Nov-19 09:02 PM] LeshAft9#0083
It's not really staking as in proof of stake. It's an active user reward. I assume you read that section here? https://komodoplatform.com/kmd-features/

[03-Nov-19 09:10 PM] PTYX#6840
I think he means launching a Pos smart chain

[03-Nov-19 09:11 PM] LeshAft9#0083
oh

[03-Nov-19 09:19 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
üôÇ I'm with THC. Looking for documentation to explain staking... UTXO's/SegID's and all that good stuff. KMD is very unique when it comes to POS and I want to make sure I am understanding what is going on when you get a stake reward. It can get confusing trying to explain to another member that is just starting to stake on THC.

[03-Nov-19 09:30 PM] Oszy#5734

Some notes and how does it work on the link above

@Chazmainian Devil

[03-Nov-19 09:40 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
Thanks @Oszy So one transparent address aka UTXO (U) has 64 SegID's (S), When you get a Stake reward it will show on block explorer which SegID was the reward winner. I think I am wrapping my head around this now.

[03-Nov-19 09:41 PM] Oszy#5734
No not really like what you wrote.

[03-Nov-19 09:42 PM] Oszy#5734
SegID's are on chain (THC chain has 64 segid's)

[03-Nov-19 09:45 PM] Oszy#5734
Your wallet, ideally, should have 64 transparent addresses, each assigned to a SegID.
One transparent address can contain thousands of different size of UTXO's, but only belong/stake on one SegID. 
AFAIK block explorer doesn't `show` segid. You can get stats with `getlastsegidstakes "blocks"`

[03-Nov-19 09:46 PM] Oszy#5734
Chew on the code of this, might give you an idea on what's happening behind the scenes. (how to properly manage UTXO's for staking on a Pos64 chain)

[03-Nov-19 09:48 PM] Oszy#5734
You want to fill up all SegID's as much UTXO's as you can, with as big UTXO's as you can.

[03-Nov-19 09:49 PM] Oszy#5734
So say you have 100K coins, you want to do 100.000 / 64 ( 1562 UTXO's on each SegID with size 1, if you want bigger UTXO's you increase size, decrease number of UTXO's)

[03-Nov-19 09:52 PM] Oszy#5734
if you only have 100k on segid 0 in one UTXO it will less likely stake than having that 100k split into 64. because there are 63 other segid's that can stake

[03-Nov-19 09:52 PM] Oszy#5734
Hope this is ELI5 enough üòÑ

[03-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
Actually, you straightened me out by explaining the way you just did.Makes a whole lotta sense to me now. My confusion started with the wrong verbage being used IE Nodes-connections when they are actually talking about Inputs/UTXO's etc. Same thing was happening in using UTXO's and SegID's.... That clarified it 100% for me. Thanks again @Oszy

[03-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Oszy#5734
You're welcome. If you have more in-depth questions don't hesitate to ask in #kmdlabs

[03-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Oszy#5734
Also, you can check your utxo staking with `getbalance64` see if your utxo's are distributed properly. If not, I highly recommend using the pos64staker tool

[03-Nov-19 09:59 PM] Oszy#5734
I also have very little knowledge about the THC chain itself i don't know how locking the 100k utxo (or whatever i saw last time was required?) changes things on that chain.

[03-Nov-19 10:00 PM] Oszy#5734
It may not even apply üòÑ

[03-Nov-19 10:07 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
Yes, pos64staker is a lifesaver but for windows users They have to make the 64 UTXO's manually. Got asked a really good question today too that I could not answer regarding whether or not to transfer coins on a Staking rewards UTXO (Basically reusing that address) until he had 64 UTXO's. I've never tried doing that and would hesitate to do that TBH.

[03-Nov-19 10:08 PM] Oszy#5734
pos64staker is python you can use it on windows

[03-Nov-19 10:08 PM] Oszy#5734
btw in windows 10 it takes 5 minutes to install Ubuntu bash (built in VM)

[03-Nov-19 10:21 PM] Chazmainian Devil#8874
People have had issues running pos64staker straight from windows in the past-not designed to work like that yet... Don't think anyone has tried BASH on Windows yet...cause then it would be the same instructions as for MAC. LOL!!! Cool!! Going to tinker now that I know this!!! Thanks a TON!

But am getting an error: configure: error: cannot find a C99-compatible compiler
Is gcc-8 not a C99-compatible compiler?

llvm is compiler infrastructure as well (contains clang anyway)

You will have to use HyperDEX to claim your funds since your trade data is in its appdir @peddycb - another option is exporting the specific trade data from there and contacting @TonyL for support on getting the funds back.

[05-Nov-19 12:36 PM] ca333#0118
@Cryptoon he used HyperDEX so its little bit different case - on atomicDEX this is an automagic feature - however, i am sure we can get that implemented in HyperDEX too.

Correct. Agama is waiting until the `komodod` reacts to the stop command. stopping it manually probably won't hurt your wallet.dat, but no guarantees. You may have to bootstrap again after killing it.
