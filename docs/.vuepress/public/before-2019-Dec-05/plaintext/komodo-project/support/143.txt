Guys! plz be careful out here! a scammer is using the handle "SHossain." acting like the real SHossain but has a dot at the end of his handle is trying to get seeds from unsuspecting users..he just tried it with me. DONT give your seed to anyone..the real SHossain will never ask you for it

I keep trying to transfer out funds from Agama Lite to Ledger and the wallet won't transfer. Any idea why it won't send?

Do you guys see LTC ?

[12-Jun-19 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
why LTC going up ?

[12-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Punk#1349
LTC going up due to mining reward halving in a couple of months.

[12-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes i read about it

[12-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000

180?

[12-Jun-19 12:36 AM] Punk#1349
I'm not sure

[12-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
someone say that can go up to 300

[12-Jun-19 12:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
but i'm not sure about that info

[12-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Punk#1349
the last time BTC halved the price soared.  Whether or not halving increases price is a debate that's useless, but many folks believe halving and price are correlated.

The Agama wallet gets hung up on "Verifying transaction data"

@TonyL 
I left Binance address on the form 05Jun, but Binance is still in the suspending to deposit KMD, shall I download Verus Wallet then refill your form?
thanks.

[12-Jun-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
binance will process it

Ahh damn. @gcharang @SHossain long story short I sent the kmd dust to another address not listed on my original support ticket so I opened a new ticket with the correct refund address. Sorry for filling out two forms!!!

[12-Jun-19 05:46 AM] gcharang#6833
@THEblackPANDA do you mean the google form?

[12-Jun-19 05:46 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Yeah

[12-Jun-19 05:47 AM] DigitalPunk#0381
@THEblackPANDA @gcharang @SHossain  I made the same mistake, sent the KMD to the  team  swept address in error. Submitted new claim form but I guess our accounts are now under dispute. No ETA when this will  be attended to

[12-Jun-19 05:49 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
Basically what happened was...I submitted a claim form a day ago with a new versus address but while I was trying to troubleshoot today I accidentally used an older version of agama with the new address so I figured it was also now compromised. After you sent me the link to disable the proxy I was able to send my dust to a new refund address I created

[12-Jun-19 05:50 AM] gcharang#6833
please wait for shossain to come back online, he will verify and update your claims

[12-Jun-19 05:50 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
After I sent the dust from the original compromised address to the newly created versus address I realized the versus address is different from the claim form I submitted therefore I created a new claim form

[12-Jun-19 05:51 AM] THEblackPANDA#9696
@gcharang sounds good

[12-Jun-19 06:50 AM] WK#7119
Good morning support. Can someone please tell me what happened to my coins? I've been waiting for the refund for a few days, unfortunately without success.

Or is there a problem with my case?

[12-Jun-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes you send the smartdust to a different address than you claimed

[12-Jun-19 07:00 AM] WK#7119
I made a mistake out of nervousness. Because I also own 2 wallet. Bitpanda and Guarda. That was my mistake. How do we get out of this situation?

[12-Jun-19 07:02 AM] gcharang#6833
@WK after shossain comes back online, he can verify and update your claim

[12-Jun-19 07:04 AM] WK#7119
Thanks for your help. I'm waiting.

[12-Jun-19 07:13 AM] Scarborough#9066

@Scarborough what is your old address?

[12-Jun-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i see only 20 have sent the smartdust from the old address to the new address, still about 200 that havent.

[12-Jun-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
until you send the smartdust to the proper claim address, the refund is stuck

[12-Jun-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
actually only 164 are not sending the smartdust yet, so at least the pending refunds are lower now

[12-Jun-19 07:32 AM] ETcrypt#3306
I have filled out the form received the smartdust in old agama on the 7th, sent it to new agama on the 9th, haven't received my tokens as yet. How can i find out if there is any issues with my claim or if anything else is required from my end

My old address of Agama wallet is RNrmYmecXGbVVw22EaxjV8rn9XCB141kJ7
@ @jl777c

[12-Jun-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@ETcrypt i dont see any claim for that address, though there are claims for other addresses to the same secure address. that is fine, but without a claim for an address, there can be no refund for that address

[12-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
@Scarborough you did not send the smartdust from RNrmYmecXGbVVw22EaxjV8rn9XCB141kJ7 to your claim address

[12-Jun-19 07:36 AM] ETcrypt#3306
@jl777c what must i do, resubmit the google form?

[12-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont send the smartdust from the old address to the new address, the refund cannot be processed

[12-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
@ETcrypt in this case it is a submit, as there is not entry for that address

[12-Jun-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so, yes, submit a claim for that address

[12-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Scarborough#9066
I filled all the information of your form on 05 Jun, no smartdust requirement on that day!  shall I refill and resubmit?
@jl777c

[12-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
dont resubmit!

[12-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
just send the smartdust to the claimed address and it will automatically get processed

[12-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you submit another claim, that will delay it

[12-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Scarborough#9066
Do not how to do

[12-Jun-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you dont know how to send funds from the old address to the claim address?

[12-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Scarborough#9066
Of course I know and did lots of times.
But what is smartdust? How can I get?

[12-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Scarborough#9066

[12-Jun-19 07:56 AM] Scarborough#9066
I saw very little amount received on 07Jun, you mean I need to transfer the amount to the new address?

[12-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Scarborough#9066
Could you please answer promptly? 
 @Deleted User

[12-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Scarborough#9066
The problem is that what I left on the form is Binance address, currently Binance suspends depositing KMD, are you sure it does work if I sent that little amount to Binance address?

[12-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Scarborough#9066
For what? This?

[12-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Scarborough#9066
Txid?

[12-Jun-19 08:08 AM] Scarborough#9066
We have different time zone, I can't stay here permanently, may I send email to him? I confirmed all the things before I submitted the form, but now you said not OK.

binance cannot stop the blockchain

[12-Jun-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the smartdust looks at the blockchain

[12-Jun-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
when binance opens trading i n the weekend it will process the deposits that come in

[12-Jun-19 08:12 AM] Scarborough#9066
So you mean I can transfer the smart dust to binance address right now, correct?
