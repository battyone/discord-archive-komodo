no for KMD you don't but you need to have a komodo.conf in `~/.komodo`

[21-Oct-19 12:57 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I'd like to look at the code that is behind a simple RPC but don't know where to find it.  Could someone please point me in the right direction?

[21-Oct-19 01:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF issuing a RPC request or creating something that responds to such requests?

[21-Oct-19 01:04 PM] CrisF#3405
I'd like to compare the code for something like `help` to compare that with what an API looks like.

[21-Oct-19 01:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Basically I'd like to see the code that is run when I do `komodo-cli help` but don't know where to find it.

[21-Oct-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
help call in turn calls all the available rpc calls with the helpflag set, each rpc call then sees that help flag and prints out the help for that comman

[21-Oct-19 01:16 PM] CrisF#3405
Maybe that isn't a good example.  I'm wondering how much code there is behind it.  Or `getinfo`. 
I'd like to see how much programming is behind that and try and read it.

[21-Oct-19 01:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
rcp code is in a bunch of different files, but here's an example - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L161

makes compiling KMD tad hard on 18.04 LTS... is this issue known ?
I think it can be reproduced with 18.04 and installing git and build-essentials and autoconf and then compiling depends then do this command
``` ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/ --disable-tests --disable-bench --disable-proton --disable-zmq```

[21-Oct-19 10:26 PM] phm87#7395
(master branch of komodoplatform repo was used)

[21-Oct-19 10:40 PM] Oszy#5734
this happened with all prequsites installed first?

[21-Oct-19 10:45 PM] Oszy#5734
could it be that 18.04 comes with a different version of one of the dependencies?

[21-Oct-19 10:46 PM] Oszy#5734
i'd try on a vm for you but it's bare late here, i can check in the morning

[22-Oct-19 05:33 AM] phm87#7395
Yes. All prerequisites were installed first. A friend of mine had this issue (I am on 16.04). Thank you

[22-Oct-19 05:35 AM] phm87#7395
My friend said: but --prefix should override the directory, where it tries to look the deps

[22-Oct-19 07:06 AM] Oszy#5734
I'll try in a VM now

[22-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Oszy#5734
ok, fresh VM, 18.04.3 LTS

[22-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Oszy#5734

whar cpu/ram?

[22-Oct-19 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
4 core 4gb

[22-Oct-19 08:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
should be enough... have you added swap space? cant hurt. and you didnt use `-j8` after `./zcutil/build.sh?`

[22-Oct-19 08:14 AM] Oszy#5734
Ok, I'll try again with 8G swap default might not be enough

[22-Oct-19 08:14 AM] Oszy#5734
i am using `-j8` of course

[22-Oct-19 08:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
try without it.

[22-Oct-19 08:20 AM] Oszy#5734
it's indeed memory hungry, ate up my 4g ram, and additional 4g swap already

@Mylo @Decker any ideas? we have 2 different errors compiling master branch on ubuntu 18.04 lts

[22-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Decker#3767
@Oszy it's about KomodoPlatform/komodo master? Let me try ... will let you know ...

[22-Oct-19 03:46 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[22-Oct-19 03:54 PM] Decker#3767
Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS / gcc version 7.4.0 (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) - compiled without any issues. But i used i7-7700k / 64 Gb RAM ...

[22-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Decker#3767
Probably you'll need to increase swap and compile with one thread (-j1) from fresh cloned repo.

[22-Oct-19 03:55 PM] Oszy#5734
ok lemme check

[22-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Decker#3767
Systems with only 4 Gb of RAM will be "unstable" anyway ...

[22-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Oszy#5734
Okay i don't know about phm87 friends specs

[22-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Oszy#5734

My VM was 4 vCores 4GB ram, 8GB swap,

[22-Oct-19 03:58 PM] Decker#3767
I faced with this when tried to run 2 chains explorers on 4 Gb RAM VPS. One of the daemons always fails, due to low memory (it was KMD as i remember and one of assetchains).

Of course, some magic with swap is possible, but better to avoid using 4 Gb RAM PC.

Or build `komodod` binary on other PC, it will be faster )

@Decker should I ask him to compile on another ubuntu/PC ? Maybe your msg was for  Oszy

[22-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Oszy#5734
ok my attempt failed with `-j1` too

[22-Oct-19 04:11 PM] Oszy#5734
i'll increase to 8gb

[22-Oct-19 04:12 PM] Decker#3767
@phm87 standart way, like:
git clone ...
zcutil/build.sh -j1
should work fine ...

[22-Oct-19 04:13 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you @Decker I will tell him

[22-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Oszy#5734
Gotcha!

[22-Oct-19 04:13 PM] Oszy#5734
compiled with 8GB RAM, in my case 4GB was too low

[22-Oct-19 04:14 PM] Oszy#5734
also 8gb swap just in case
