how can i import the eth private key to my mew wallet now?

[06-Jun-19 03:22 PM] gcharang#6833
mew can be used, but use it at your own risk

[06-Jun-19 03:24 PM] gcharang#6833
@cygan did'nt you find any good desktop wallets for eth?

[06-Jun-19 03:25 PM] cygan#2881
which one u prefer?

I don't use ETH man, so I don't know
the link is from ethereum.org, select one that looks good

If I can't get to a wallet until next week, Is there a chance that it can be saved by the ongoing team effort? I'm hoping either I get to it or the team does before the bad guys

[06-Jun-19 03:32 PM] TS#7923
You can use MEW locally, that‚Äôs the safest

[06-Jun-19 03:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@jspook16 can't you guide someone at home to secure them for you?

[06-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Dom001#1832
anyone know, if Chips have been transferred to the SafeAddress as well today?

[06-Jun-19 03:35 PM] jspook16#3059
@gcharang it is in an reachable place at this time.

[06-Jun-19 03:36 PM] gcharang#6833
do you remember the exact last time you opened agama and input the seed into it?

[06-Jun-19 03:36 PM] jspook16#3059
It was a native wallet

[06-Jun-19 03:37 PM] jspook16#3059
Haven't touched it in a year or so

[06-Jun-19 03:37 PM] gcharang#6833
then you are 99.99% safe

[06-Jun-19 03:37 PM] jspook16#3059
Was the exploit for spv wallets?

[06-Jun-19 03:38 PM] gcharang#6833
the seed input step in the agama app itself

[06-Jun-19 03:38 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh. Was it saving it off somewhere?

[06-Jun-19 03:39 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, in a remote server

[06-Jun-19 03:39 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh wow

Hello, I had some KMD and they were sweeped yesterday by Komodo team. I've filled the form. Who can help me recover my KMD.

[06-Jun-19 03:48 PM] Dom001#1832
when i try to move my Hush to the new address i get an "invalid pub address" error, anyone an idea pls?

[06-Jun-19 03:55 PM] jspook16#3059
I had to use an older version of agama

[06-Jun-19 03:55 PM] jspook16#3059
0.3.4

[06-Jun-19 03:56 PM] jspook16#3059
I was seeing the same thing trying to move btc

[06-Jun-19 03:58 PM] technofloof#8761
in the google form I submitted a binance address will this be a problem?

[06-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Allen#8663
@technofloof binance has suspended deposits. make new one in coinomi or something.

[06-Jun-19 04:01 PM] CuzznDread#2836
I'm having the same issue with moving my KMD as @Dom001 
Getting same error

[06-Jun-19 04:04 PM] jspook16#3059
I used an older version of agama. I don't know if that is a safe way to do it but I had to try something

[06-Jun-19 04:04 PM] jspook16#3059
It worked for me

[06-Jun-19 04:08 PM] technofloof#8761
wait was there more than one hack? Did the komodo team take some kmd but another source took more too?

[06-Jun-19 04:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@CuzznDread for KMD, using this version of Verus Agama: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
and disabling proxy as shown here: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/
should definitely work

@technofloof it was simply a race to take more then the hacker using the same exploit as the hacker

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] technofloof#8761
@gcharang just double checked and my funds were saved by the team via the safe wallet

[06-Jun-19 04:13 PM] technofloof#8761
i already submitted the form is there away to change it or will re-distro be done once binance is stop suspending as i put that in to be quick

it was spooky

when most of the funds are secured and we have received claims from most wallets,
we will decide on the process and inform the community

hi. my coins got withdrawed to the following adresses:

Hello! Looking for support regarding Agama  v0.3.6b-beta wallet. I can sign in with PW, but after flashing a screen that says balance 0, the window goes blank.   Inputting my seed words into  veras-Agama (v.0.6.0-13=PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview) produces a transaction history that I don't recognize, including a final transaction with amount NaN on 4 Jun 2019, and balance 0. Advice?

[06-Jun-19 04:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@virtuous can you check your balance on the explorer & where it ends up ?

[06-Jun-19 04:46 PM] virtuous#5181
the final transaction, 12a029ec5d84795e3bb55149940fa4f15fd631e6207fd28fd3b5aff30b3b615f, sent most of the KMD to the safe address  RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF and the rest to  RL4sy2kEqU4e5ZtEUK5W9AjQWpty7uq7Aj

[06-Jun-19 04:46 PM] pcfixecrypto#2852
Hi, I downloaded the komodo ocean qt wallet and the chain. Then I closed it when it was over and now it is starting from scratch again. What did I do wrong ?

[06-Jun-19 04:50 PM] jeffjam#9765
Why it isnt possible to download the chain offline and load it up to agama at once?

[06-Jun-19 04:51 PM] 24052019#7280
Hey, i submitted a claim yesterday with the information required. i put the address to my nano s ledger, is this fine? also any eta on the funds being dispersed ?

but it won't bring the chain to the latest, because new blocks are generated almost every minute

[06-Jun-19 04:54 PM] gcharang#6833
@virtuous RL4sy2kEqU4e5ZtEUK5W9AjQWpty7uq7Aj is an intermediate address, funds from that address are sent to the safe address too
so you can fill the form for all the finds that were swept from your address

[06-Jun-19 04:54 PM] jeffjam#9765
Well a day long delay az most

[06-Jun-19 04:54 PM] jeffjam#9765
Better then 2 years of syncing

@24052019 it's fine with the ledger nano s, as long as your ledger seed / private keys are not used on Agama

[06-Jun-19 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007
here some of you have used ZILLA, PGT, BNTN, NINJA, VOTE2019 and few other Assetchain in the claim form. please note, you have to move those coins by yourself. we didn't sweep all AC. we only sweept the following to the safe address
```
KMD
BTC
SUPERNET
REVS
MSHARK
HODL
REVS
DEX
CRYPTO
PANGEA
JUMBLR
BET
BOTS
MGW
VRSC
```
and VOTE2019 doesn't have any value any more.

[06-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
@SHossain should we make a new form if we wrote other assets than KMD?`

[06-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Llama#1330
why is anybody claiming bntn

[06-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I meant erc20

hello, a question regarding Verus Agama: I made a new wallet, saved the seed, but since then i deleted a lot of files from PC, don't have the seed anymore. no funds are in these wallets. now when i open Verus Agama, i con only login, not create a new one. how does this work? I wanna start from fresh new seed again

[06-Jun-19 05:20 PM] Lennart#9331
thx

there is a guide on how to export privkey of ETH/ERC20 from seed. use that

Yes I have done that

[06-Jun-19 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
also, Verus Enhanced Agama Preview supports both coin you had issues with

[06-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Oh nice

[06-Jun-19 05:22 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Is it possible to claim rewards from Ledger X?

[06-Jun-19 05:22 PM] PTYX#6840
@Mr.Cryptodude yes, use magnum wallet or the atomic labs tool to do so

[06-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Is it hard to do?

[06-Jun-19 05:23 PM] PTYX#6840
not sure if the atomic labs tool works with nano x but magnum does.

[06-Jun-19 05:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I noticed that CHIPS are being swept as well, technically not an asset chain but may be we could add it to the list ?

[06-Jun-19 05:23 PM] PTYX#6840
no, super easy

Apologies if this was already answered but, can the OceanQT wallet claim rewards?

[06-Jun-19 05:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
technically yes, because claim rewards <=> send funds to yourself , to the same address

[06-Jun-19 05:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@RJF send to own address, that will claim rewards
