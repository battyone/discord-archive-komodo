there is only one issuing of coins at the start with ac_supply

[04-Jul-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <kso> Thank you very much @jl777c!

[04-Jul-18 11:56 AM] Hermes#6934
@StakeSourcePoS When you make a new installation of Agama the essential or key information is not lost , basically the new version will be rewritten  on top .

[slack] <rhex1> So, my Agama won't synch

[04-Jul-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> v2.41

[04-Jul-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> Won't synch since june 18't

[04-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Hermes#6934
Hi there please try a resync from scratch https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/162562089/Agama+Windows+Guide+How+to+Resync+from+scratch if you are on native mode, if that's not the case please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will review this shortly.

[04-Jul-18 01:41 PM] LordTricky#7840
Are the agama spv servers down? STILL?

[04-Jul-18 01:53 PM] LordTricky#7840
guess not, but agama needs an auto update feature, or at least a notification that says the version you are using is now out of date

[04-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Hermes#6934
Make sure you have the latest Agama version 2.41

[04-Jul-18 01:58 PM] LordTricky#7840
i have but these constant updates are getting incestuous, they need to automate the process.

[04-Jul-18 01:59 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you experiencing a server connection error with version 2.41?

[04-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Chris11111#2957
I can't seem to be getting around a javascript error when trying to open agama. I have rebooted, uninstalled, reinstalled all twice over. Nothing seems to be working.

[04-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Hermes#6934
@Chris11111 you are installing and selecting the english version of the wallet right? Please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will try to replicate, also send us your machines Windows version and screenshots of the error if possible.

[04-Jul-18 04:53 PM] LordTricky#7840
@Hermes sorry, no mate. 2.41 works at the mo üòÉ

[04-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Chris11111#2957
Yes, I am using the English version. I sent in a ticket and tried to provide as much detail as possible.

[04-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Hermes#6934
Ok I will get back to you on the ticket I will be testing and seeing what can be causing the issue

[04-Jul-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> I will resynch from scratch now

[04-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> Yeah it's synching!

[04-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Hermes#6934
Good to know that

[04-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Hermes#6934
Let us know if it finishes synching

but on the website they are already updated

[05-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <kso> Hi @jl777c, may I please ask to confirm whether my understanding is correct or not. Say we create an assetchain with ac_supply=270000000 coins
and ac_reward=3 coins

After the second block gets mined and assuming all block rewards and the premine of 270000000 go to the same node, will that node now have two utxo's like this:
utxo #1: 270000000
utxo #2:                   3

Giving a balance of 270000003.

Then after the 3rd block gets mined will that node now have 3 utxos like this:

utxo #1: 270000000
utxo #2:                   3
utxo #3:                   3

Giving a balance of 270000006 coins for that node.

[05-Jul-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yees

[05-Jul-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
but at a block reward of 3 it will take a long time to get to a billion coins

[05-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <kso> Thanks very much @jl777c for the confirmation! Yes we'll need to calculate a bigger block reward! Have a nice day! üôÇ

[06-Jul-18 01:27 AM] Chris11111#2957
When using the web wallet, I tried to claim interest. Interest didn't go through and now the lock time is not set.

[06-Jul-18 01:36 AM] Hermes#6934
You couldn‚Äôt claim the reward did it showed that you had rewards to claim ?

[06-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Chris11111#2957
Yeah it showed I had some then I clicked claim, and it produced an unknown tx

[06-Jul-18 01:52 AM] Chris11111#2957
Looks like I can't post a picture, but it says unknown in the amount and the locktime is now not starting

[06-Jul-18 03:08 AM] Nabob#5004
@Chris11111  please be cautious using web wallet, never use large amount funds. its still in early development phase

[06-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Nabob#5004
meanwhile, move all your funds to agama wallet

[06-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Chris11111#2957
I only was using it because I was having trouble with a Javascript error when using desktop wallet

[06-Jul-18 03:09 AM] Chris11111#2957
That's the only reason I used it unfortunately is because I can't get Agama desktop app to run

[06-Jul-18 03:10 AM] Nabob#5004
post the error screenshot of agama wallet, will help you to fix

[06-Jul-18 03:10 AM] Chris11111#2957
I sent in a support ticket the other day with the screenshot

[06-Jul-18 03:11 AM] Nabob#5004
ok

I lost my interest after claiming it

[06-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Hermes#6934
@SRG  Please file a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com so we can review this , if you are using native mode most likely is in a change address. You can trigger a wallet rescan and you should be able to see it.

[06-Jul-18 12:38 PM] SRG#0675
I used Agama web wallet

[06-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Hermes#6934
For now don't use the web wallet is on testing mode , please use the app. send us the tx id that you have for this and we will look into it

[06-Jul-18 05:26 PM] SRG#0675
Below is the Tx Id used for claiming the interest cd27d83edea975af27487ad1d65615cc302e12a8a594f0341d3dc77d3b34fe84

[06-Jul-18 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@SRG did what did you use to pull those funds from the z_addy?

[06-Jul-18 05:34 PM] SRG#0675
Didn't get you @ComputerGenie

[06-Jul-18 05:34 PM] SRG#0675
I simply tried to claim the interest that I earned

looks like they were in a private z address at some point

[06-Jul-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
@SRG Thanks for reporting. Agama web wallet is now fixed and live by @pbca26 
Please note: The web wallet is highly experimental and under active development. Don't use the web wallet with large sum of funds.

[06-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Hermes#6934
@SRG  Over here is difficult to give you a proper answer to your issue please send a ticket to support@komodoplatform.com to also have it documented

[06-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Hermes#6934
True I just tested it a while ago and it works

[06-Jul-18 05:43 PM] SRG#0675
@shossain what about my funds that I lost?

[06-Jul-18 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I could be wrong, but what it looks like to me is that when it came out of the z addy and was initially split into the 450 it didn't get timelock stamp

[06-Jul-18 05:44 PM] SHossain#0007
accrued rewards may have ended up to miner

[06-Jul-18 05:44 PM] SRG#0675
Then now?

[06-Jul-18 05:46 PM] SRG#0675
@shossain so I lost those funds permanently?

[06-Jul-18 05:48 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes and you already received a reward for submitting the bug. that should cover your losses.

[07-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Hermes#6934
You can also try a rescan but most likely you will need to the procedure for the resync as showed above . Here is the guide for the rescan of the wallet. https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/1179728/Rescan+Wallet+with+Agama

[07-Jul-18 09:42 PM] SRG#0675
@Hermes  I am working on cli

[07-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Hermes#6934
The procedure with the first guide is the same , after yo do this the resync will also work on the CLI

[07-Jul-18 09:43 PM] SRG#0675
I already tried resync
