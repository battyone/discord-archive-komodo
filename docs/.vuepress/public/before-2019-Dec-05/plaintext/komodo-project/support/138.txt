[09-Jun-19 10:09 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you can use verus agama to log in your old address

[09-Jun-19 10:10 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
okay thanks... better idea üòÉ

[09-Jun-19 10:16 PM] Teleporter#1797
so I need to move funds from agama wallet?

[09-Jun-19 10:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
only if you have used old agama to access your funds in the past 5 months

[09-Jun-19 10:17 PM] Teleporter#1797
It is my first time I download agama and log into my wallet with agama

[09-Jun-19 10:17 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then you are fine

[09-Jun-19 10:18 PM] Teleporter#1797

@SHossain when will deposit and withdrawals be unsuspended?

[09-Jun-19 10:29 PM] SHossain#0007

my KMD gone ... filled claim... waiting on native chain to load on old Agama and computer... as i can't access old native chains on Verus Agama because native chains are tagged to the wallet.dat on this computer

[09-Jun-19 11:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you should be able to access old native chain using verus agama

[09-Jun-19 11:54 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
hmmm dont know how

[09-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
run kmd in native on verus agama?

[09-Jun-19 11:55 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
im on two different computers

[09-Jun-19 11:55 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
old Agama on one

[09-Jun-19 11:55 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
new Verus Agama on the other

[09-Jun-19 11:56 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you can install verus agama on the other computer as well

[09-Jun-19 11:57 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
i suppose... didnt want the wallets to generate old wallet addresses and have possible security risks

[09-Jun-19 11:57 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
old Agama also on a crappy Mac

[09-Jun-19 11:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
save the wallet.dat

[09-Jun-19 11:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
uninstall old agama then install verus agama

[09-Jun-19 11:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
only addresses used in old agama are compromised. not the wallet.dat

[09-Jun-19 11:59 PM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
save the wallet.dat
uninstall old agama then install verus agama
replace wallet.dat in verus?

[10-Jun-19 12:01 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
ive just generated new addresses on Verus to file KMD claim and transfer my pirate too if its there... once this old wallet re-syncs

[10-Jun-19 12:01 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
thanks for help... will do this if this doesnt work

[10-Jun-19 12:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
verus agama is just a client much like old agama

[10-Jun-19 12:02 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so installing verus agama on old agama computer will let u acccess the fund

[10-Jun-19 12:02 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then you can send the fund to new address generated in new computer

[10-Jun-19 12:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
does that make sense?

[10-Jun-19 12:03 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
okay... will blockchain have to resync on old computer new Verus?

[10-Jun-19 12:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if you use native then yes

[10-Jun-19 12:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if you can find the WIF key for the address that have funds

[10-Jun-19 12:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then you can just login using WIF

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
WIF is 16 word passphrase?

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
i have that

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
okay will use lite and native for pirate... but thats a long resync

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
so i have to replace the wallet.dat though?

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
correct if you are using native

[10-Jun-19 12:06 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
ok

[10-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
WIF is private key , 16 word passphrase is seed

i'm assuming we should hold on submitting forms for non-kmd assets until kmd is sorted out ?

KMD first, assets will take longer as it is almost as much work as KMD for each assetchain
the number of addresses doesnt matter
what matters is if you did the proper steps and didnt submit conflicting data
i get daily claims data
i will process daily
not setup for assets yet

[10-Jun-19 01:36 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
@Cryptoon should the wallet.dat i take out of old Agama be from Pirate or Komodo?

[10-Jun-19 01:37 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
pulled Pirates... getting Error starting PIRATE daemon Port @ template@ is already taken

[10-Jun-19 01:37 AM] orange sunshine#8588
must be frustrating to have all this time get channeled to this sort of crap.  Beautiful response by the team.
