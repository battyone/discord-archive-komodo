weeell-- this scamming fever is a bit unsettling

[29-Nov-19 11:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
so is this the mandatory upcoming update?

[29-Nov-19 11:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
I would think not, bcs this came a bit out of the blue

[29-Nov-19 11:31 AM] LocoMB#8593
I am using komodod - is it ok if I just 'git pull' and then buld again? Or do I have to switch branches?

[29-Nov-19 11:32 AM] Oszy#5734
yes you can

[29-Nov-19 11:32 AM] Oszy#5734
if you prefer that

[29-Nov-19 11:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@LocoMB if you are using oceanqt: <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-7>
if you are using komodod, git pull and build should be enough

[29-Nov-19 11:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
Thanks! by the way, this issue does not appear when using REVS and other assetchains with komodod

[29-Nov-19 11:34 AM] Oszy#5734
it only affected KMD afaik

[29-Nov-19 12:01 PM] LocoMB#8593
yep, 'git pull' and 'zcutil/build.sh -j8' did it! Thanks! ‚öôÔ∏è

I had some DEX that I forgot to claim after Agama seeds hack and rescue. Claimed all the other assests but forgot DEX. Anybody knows if it would still be possible?

[29-Nov-19 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, fill in the form

[29-Nov-19 01:47 PM] Tantale#1431
On the Komodo website, I guess ? Can‚Äôt remember !

[29-Nov-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Tantale if the old and new address pair for DEX is the same as another KMD asset, just send me the details in DM

[29-Nov-19 02:15 PM] Tantale#1431
@gcharang  Done!

[30-Nov-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
might need to make a fresh clone

[30-Nov-19 01:25 PM] ns408#8889
thanks. I was about to say that I'm doing a fresh clone but on checking the setup, realised that the clean-up was being done from within a container and the user didn't have the right permissions to perform the clean-up and was moving on-to the next step anyway.

[30-Nov-19 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
@ns408 did you have a fix for this? Just saw the same

[30-Nov-19 06:41 PM] crypt#5062
hello, i`ve found supernet assets in a old nxt-account. Is it still possible to migrate? thx

[30-Nov-19 06:45 PM] SHossain#0007
how many assets you have? the migration has ended over 1.5 years ago

[30-Nov-19 06:51 PM] crypt#5062
73 supernet and 733 instantdex

[30-Nov-19 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry, the migration is over

[30-Nov-19 07:10 PM] SHossain#0007
too late now

[30-Nov-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright i updated OS distribution then it worked

[30-Nov-19 07:49 PM] ns408#8889
@Alright either delete the directory which contains the source or do a `git reset --hard; git pull --rebase` from within that directory. üôÇ

Before running the steps to compile komodo.

[30-Nov-19 08:02 PM] ns408#8889
I just sent kmd from komodo-cli to the same address to claim the interest. Not seeing any change in the value. Is there a step I have missed?
I did check the address beforehand to see if there's any unclaimed rewards: https://dexstats.info/rewards.php

what's your address or txid? did you check on explorer?

[30-Nov-19 08:03 PM] ns408#8889
dm'ing you

[30-Nov-19 08:03 PM] ns408#8889
I did check on the explorer and nothing related to the value of unclaimed reward.

[30-Nov-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to wait 777 seconds or about an hour before your utxos start accruing reward

[30-Nov-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
the tx you did had only 16 confs

[30-Nov-19 08:06 PM] SHossain#0007
they didn't accrue any reward to claim

[30-Nov-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
the previous tx you did had accrued reward but it wasn't claimed. reward went to miner

[30-Nov-19 08:12 PM] ns408#8889
I used `komodo-cli z_sendmany` instead of `komodo-cli sendtoaddress` which caused this. :(
Thanks to Shossain, now I know what not to do.

Is it possible to install two wallets on the same machine. i.e versus agama and Komodo oceanqt?

[01-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Oszy#5734
yes

[01-Dec-19 06:45 PM] zafar177#6208
I only ask because I installed the latest version of versus but it keeps getting stuck at around 99.5% even after fresh install and rescan.

[01-Dec-19 07:07 PM] Oszy#5734
they haven't updated the komodo daemon in the wallet yet

[01-Dec-19 07:07 PM] Oszy#5734
wait for an update from Verus

[02-Dec-19 02:53 AM] Fr√©dBastiat#0367
Hello, I'm looking for some help/pointers upgrading from BarterDEX 1.1.1-rc to the current Komodo DEX. I figured I would log into my existing install (since I still have my passphrase), move my coins out to another wallet, and start again with the current DEX (OceanQT, I think). However, when I log into BarterDEX, it says, "Bitcoin (BTC): Couldn't find an installation of this coin."

Is there some other bitcoin wallet software that I need to be running on my computer for BarterDEX to work correctly?

[02-Dec-19 03:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fr√©dBastiat just use your passphrase in new app. AtomicDEX or Verus Agama Wallet

[02-Dec-19 03:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
your coins will be visible there.

[02-Dec-19 03:44 AM] Fr√©dBastiat#0367
oh, okay. Thanks.

[02-Dec-19 02:48 PM] zafar177#6208
Any ETA on versus agama wallet update? My wallet has been stuck on block 1635296 for two days.

[02-Dec-19 03:11 PM] Oszy#5734
ask verus

[02-Dec-19 03:11 PM] Oszy#5734
the fix is available already from komodo's side

Hey everybody
I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the "ac_blocktime" configuration. I do understand that we set the desired average time for a block to be mined and it does not necessarily has to be exactly the value configured.
However, while I have ac_blocktime set to 5 (which is supposed to be 5 seconds, I believe), it actually takes my nodes about a minute or so to create a new block. It's been more then few days already and the network had to stabilize at this point (that is if I understand the term correctly)
So I was wondering if I'm missing something here. Does the nodes count have to do anything with the network ability to keep up with the desired blocktime? As I'm currently testing it with a network that consists of only two nodes.
Appreciate any help, thanks!

[03-Dec-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
how fast are your CPU?

[03-Dec-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
are you mining with one core each?

[03-Dec-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you probably need to mine with more cores or use faster CPU if you only have 2 nodes

[03-Dec-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to have dozens (or hundreds) of nodes CPU mining, so the time to calculate a block can be short. but 5 seconds might be a bit too fast

[04-Dec-19 06:39 AM] Alright#0419
5 seconds may be too fast for CPU miner in daemon all together

[04-Dec-19 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
Would recommend you try a stratum, if that doesn't work well(it should), increase blocktime

[04-Dec-19 09:04 AM] YanSidorov#2533
I see, thanks. Probably the CPU is indeed a bottleneck, it ain't of the top-notch.
@Alright , care to share any articles or docs on what stratum actually is? So far I've managed to find a Knomp GitHub repository and few stratum protocol mentions in Komodo docs, but none of those shed any light.

[04-Dec-19 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
stratum protocol is what basically all mining pools use to split shares amongst many miners

[04-Dec-19 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
why do you need such fast blocktimes?

[04-Dec-19 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
it's likely to cause issues, would recommend at least 10 seconds

[04-Dec-19 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
5 seconds should work, but you'll have a lot of orphans

[04-Dec-19 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
will be a lot more bandwidth than it needs to be because of that

[04-Dec-19 09:18 AM] YanSidorov#2533
It isn't really me who need such a short blocktime. My customers do.
They want to have a transaction processing time like 3-5 seconds while having as least nodes as it's possible (don't even ask me the point of it, there's none üôÇ )
So I was just trying to figure out if it's even possible to achieve

[04-Dec-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
use GPU to mine then

[04-Dec-19 09:21 AM] gcharang#6833
for instant payments, channels can be used <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/channels.html>
note that the chain needs to have dPoW enabled for secure usage of the Channels module
@YanSidorov

[04-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but for 5 seconds txtime for unconstrained tx, having a smallish number of nodes and GPU mining would be the way.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] gcharang#6833
agreed, but someone asking for 3-5 second blocktime is most likely looking for instant payments

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
yes, if you don't expect to have many mining nodes, 5 seconds will be fine with a GPU

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
the problem is when you have many mining nodes trying to produce 5 second blocks, you have orphans for basically every block

[04-Dec-19 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
doubling(or even more) the bandwidth used

[04-Dec-19 09:54 AM] YanSidorov#2533
I see your point. Thanks, pals!
I'll try looking into stratum and channels deeper.
