@H lim do it as soon as you can

[07-Jun-19 02:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
We have a few people who have reported they will be away, we will process their claims when they return. You might want to leave a ticket on support desk explaining your sitution for future reference

I filled out and handed in my refund form yesterday. When I checked my form again today, the form has changed. Should I resubmit it?

How do I get the seed for my new wallet address?

[07-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I'm confused ... new form?  do not have time to read the history now.  I ask for a clear message regarding the new form.

[07-Jun-19 04:00 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Deleted User So I do not have to do anything?!

[07-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Jimm B.#9993

@Cosmostation_LEE how did u check the form ?

[07-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Cosmostation_LEE#8636
There's no big difference. It's just turned into a slightly more efficient form.

I filled out my form yesterday. And I checked the link to the notice again, but I was just wondering because the item was slightly different.

[07-Jun-19 04:04 AM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
As long as the info u provided is same .. i guess its all that matters

[07-Jun-19 04:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dudezmobi  yes?

[07-Jun-19 04:09 AM] Cosmostation_LEE#8636
I'm sorry for confusing you guys. I just wondering

[07-Jun-19 04:16 AM] AkiraX#8269
Hi

[07-Jun-19 04:16 AM] istante#3749
@gcharang is there a new form to compile ? We are very confused now. Could you give us clear info about it? I have already compiled old form.

[07-Jun-19 04:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Form was updated to make it easier to submit multiple accounts. If you have already filled it in, no need to do it again.

[07-Jun-19 04:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator I filled it in twice, first time I forgot to add the #1234 number of my discord handle - this was in the excitement right after the incident started, and the second time an hour later - I guess that should not be too much of a problem

[07-Jun-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
thats ok, if form needs to be updated you can do it again üòÉ

[07-Jun-19 04:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
is an email better than discord name? I'll just leave it as it is

[07-Jun-19 04:58 AM] dudezmobi#1945

Hi all.  I'm using 0.6 of the Verus Agama and can't send or get transaction history.  Message says "Unable to get transactions history data (code: apiElectrumTransactions).  Have already disabled Proxy per the pinned instructions.  Any recommendations?

[07-Jun-19 05:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
are you using a VPN, and has an firewall exception been added for Verus Agama?

[07-Jun-19 05:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
It may be intermittent issues with the server due to load

[07-Jun-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If all else fails, go native ‚öî

[07-Jun-19 05:11 AM] MC7575#0466
Firewall exception has been made.  No on vpn but possible being blocked by security software.  Ack going native.  Will try - thanks.

[07-Jun-19 06:44 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Seems a lot sketchy

[07-Jun-19 06:48 AM] dxer666#8963
please confirm both are same from komodo team or no?

[07-Jun-19 06:50 AM] cipi#4502
no, they are not the same

[07-Jun-19 06:51 AM] cipi#4502
don't send your keys to anyone

[07-Jun-19 06:52 AM] dxer666#8963
oh so he stole my data

[07-Jun-19 06:52 AM] dxer666#8963
he give my email , seed , tx id, balance ...

[07-Jun-19 06:53 AM] dxer666#8963
now he can fill the calim form and steal my  balance

[07-Jun-19 06:55 AM] cipi#4502
did you sent him keys (passphrase/seed/WIF), or just some txids and addresses?

[07-Jun-19 06:56 AM] dxer666#8963
he regust me my seed , i give him my seed

[07-Jun-19 06:57 AM] dxer666#8963
i thinked he is from support team, because it was simillar SHossain#0007

[07-Jun-19 06:57 AM] dxer666#8963
and maybe  he need my seed to confirm that i am trust

[07-Jun-19 06:58 AM] cipi#4502
were the funds from this seed already sent to the KMD team safe address? If so, no worries...

[07-Jun-19 06:58 AM] dxer666#8963
yes my balance from old address has been sent to safe address

[07-Jun-19 06:59 AM] dxer666#8963
also i moved 5th other assests to new address

[07-Jun-19 06:59 AM] cipi#4502
then it is safe... the team will not return the funds to the scammer... all good

[07-Jun-19 07:00 AM] cipi#4502
if you didn't sent him seed for the new address (where the funds are atm), only for the old address (empty) then all is good

[07-Jun-19 07:00 AM] dxer666#8963
but last night he stole my data . with making username same of team

[07-Jun-19 07:00 AM] dxer666#8963
i didont give him seed of new address

[07-Jun-19 07:01 AM] dxer666#8963
just old address

[07-Jun-19 07:01 AM] cipi#4502
then it is safe

[07-Jun-19 07:02 AM] dxer666#8963
but he can fill form and regust my balance to new kmd address

[07-Jun-19 07:03 AM] cipi#4502

If the hacker knows the same information as you did, how can the team know you are not the hacker?

[07-Jun-19 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@dxer666 with your discord handle (and other methods), we should be able to verify

[07-Jun-19 07:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@dsalinas79 you can try Komodo Ocean method

[07-Jun-19 07:38 AM] kimixi#5955
I filled two different forms but should all assets be in one single form?

[07-Jun-19 07:39 AM] dxer666#8963
