do you have a backup of your wallet.dat? did you use native mode before using old version to send funds or claim reward?

[14-Dec-18 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007

[14-Dec-18 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
this address contains funds. if you have seed or private key for this address, you should be able to access them

[14-Dec-18 05:38 PM] SHossain#0007

@Nabob @Team  Admin @Admin 

I have run the command `ps -ef | grep marketmaker`, and getting a list of coins. ABP is still not showing up in the list, but I have added it to the `~/SuperNet/iguana/dexscripts/coins` file in the `export coins =` line in JSON format. Thanks again guys I really appreciate your help. I just want to know what I am doing wrong.

[14-Dec-18 08:02 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
are there steps defined for asset chain upgrades?  checked around and don't see an upgrade doc

[14-Dec-18 08:05 PM] Hermes#6934
assetchain upgrades you mean for sapling?

[14-Dec-18 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
1. Navigate to your Komodo directory.
`cd ~/komodo`
2. Make sure you don't have any changes made to the source and reset it. This will ensure clean source and shouldn't create issue while pulling the latest source in the next step.
`git reset --hard`
3. Use master branch
`git checkout beta`
4. Clean the source directory.
`make clean`
5. Update the source. (If you‚Äôve made any changes to the source code, this step may not pull the latest source. Please make sure you used the step above to eliminate this issue.)
`git pull`
6. Fetch updated zcash sapling params
`./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`
7. Compile the latest binary.
`./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`
Start your daemon as usual. (If you have not stopped the Komodo daemon before compiling, please stop the daemon now and start it again.)
8. Verify the update
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN getinfo`
Please look for the KMDversion in the output of the above call, which should display:
`"KMDversion": "0.3.1",`

@SHossain Thanks

[14-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
crap...i have my kmd for asset payment in ledger...lol..good thing price is low...silver lining I guess

[14-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Hermes#6934
There are still options if you really need to manage your funds while Ledger updates...here is a guide that gives you a couple of options depending on your convenience https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000026860-komodo-sapling-upgrade-important-info-for-ledger-users/en

[14-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
its ok...I'll just buy some more...I have no problem buying kmd or nxs at these prices...we may dip a lot more but both are currently great deals imo in long run. (I'm using both for dev purposes so its an investment in a tool...not a speculation)

[14-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
almost done compiling...any other things that need to be done prior to tomorrow?  wallet is upgraded...kmd is upgraded...is it safe for me to go back under my coding rock?

[14-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Hermes#6934
"KMDversion": "0.3.1" if that's correct you are good to go

[14-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
"KMDversion": "0.3.2",

[14-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
@Hermes  @SHossain I'm a version ahead...is that a problem?

[14-Dec-18 08:36 PM] SHossain#0007
did you pull latest source?

[14-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Captain_Jack#0015

@SHossain @Hermes Hey guys can any of you help me with my issue?

üò∞

[14-Dec-18 10:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@ABP brewmaster it seems you don't have your coin details in `coins` file. you need to add that. if you have more questions, best place to ask is #dev-tradebots

[14-Dec-18 10:36 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I did exactly what cipi told me to do ```Hi,

7783 is always the correct port, it is the RPC-API-port from marketmaker.

You need to add your coin to the coins file manually, it is not added
automatically, only for the GUI.
You need an entry like this
{\"coin\":\"AYWA\",\"name\":\"aywa\",\"confpath\":\"${HOME#}/.aywacore/aywa.conf\",\"rpcport\":2778,\"pubtype\":23,\"p2shtype\":83,\"wiftype\":150,\"txfee\":10000}
with the values for ABP. The file is ~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts/coins

Kind regrads,
Cipi.```

[14-Dec-18 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have the correct info there, it should work.

[14-Dec-18 10:37 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
```export coins="[{\"coin\":\"PIRATE\",\"asset\":\"PIRATE\",\"rpcport\":45453,\"txfee\":10000},{\"coin\":\"SEC\",\"asset\":\"SEC\",\"rpcport\":11540},{\"coin\":\"PAT\",\"name\":\"pat\",\"etomic\":\"0xBB1fA$
#{\"coin\":\"CMM\",\"name\":\"commercium\",\"rpcport\":9657,\"pubtype\":28,\"p2shtype\":50,\"wiftype\":140,\"txfee\":10000},```

[14-Dec-18 10:38 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
I added it in JSON at the end of the export coins line inside brackets

[14-Dec-18 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
include in the front side then

[14-Dec-18 10:39 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
Ok just like CMM but without the pound sign

I was able to sync the wallet 100 percent but its not showing my balance. i have my wallet.dat saved on a usb and i went user-appdata-roaming and transfered the new wallet. its showing zero balance

[14-Dec-18 10:49 PM] Hermes#6934
@leiyinglo01  did you switched your PC ?

[14-Dec-18 10:50 PM] Hermes#6934
%appdata%/Roaming/Komodo/ correct?

[14-Dec-18 10:51 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
yes , same computer just different network cuz i moved to a new house with new wifi

[14-Dec-18 10:51 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
I mean no same computer

[14-Dec-18 10:51 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
and yeas on appdat-roaming-komodo

[14-Dec-18 10:53 PM] Hermes#6934
it's the same computer you had one walle.dat saved in your USB and another one that you replaced for the one in your USB is that correct? Did you saved the wallet.dat in the USB after your last transaction ?

[14-Dec-18 10:57 PM] ABP brewmaster#0177
@SHossain Ok it's added in the ```export coins="[{\"coin\":\"ABP\",\"name\":\"ABP Network\",\"active\":1,\"rpcport\":5426,\"pubtype\":30,\"p2shtype\":15,\"wiftype\":212,\"txfee\":10000},```

of course

sorry i read saplinghossains log

[14-Dec-18 11:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@ABP brewmaster please contact cipi at #dev-tradebots

[14-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Hermes#6934
Try that walle.dat @leiyinglo01  and always when you are doing a back up of your wallet.dat make sure to not only copy the wallet.dat but copy the private key of the address that has your funds.

[14-Dec-18 11:10 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
then i might have lost all my funds cuz i didnt save the private key- i had aboout  600 ccoins which i paid $3 each back then

[14-Dec-18 11:11 PM] leiyinglo01#0825
my walletdat has 96kb

[14-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Hermes#6934
but you have the one of your desktop also right?

[14-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Hermes#6934
do you have the address that has the funds and have checked in the explorer...

[14-Dec-18 11:13 PM] Hermes#6934
you can try and validateaddress in the CLI
