Dont think they will ask that entity

[05-Jun-19 11:49 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I don't think we want to ask for that either

Ugh. You know that there will be thousands fraudulent claims....

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Entity#5862
Probabaly yes

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] OsTa#2589
How you can proove that you are the owner of the address with the google typeform?

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
dont think so

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Entity#5862
Yes that

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] OsTa#2589
anybody can do it...

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
only the / those who have exploited / know will "possibly" be able to make false claims

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
not anyone can and even then theres a lot of what ifs/unknowns/ 2ndary vlidation to get funds im sure kmd wont just send to someone saying ""this address is mine""

[05-Jun-19 11:50 AM] tomsmith26#8707
My KMD funds have been moved to  another address today so  How can I get my KMD back?

[05-Jun-19 11:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Details to be announced later. Broadcasting too early is not ideal in terms of security

[05-Jun-19 11:51 AM] OsTa#2589
@Crabby Paddy I disagree, I shared few informations from my address on this discord. Now people can claim for me lol

[05-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239

ahh better 😄

[05-Jun-19 11:51 AM] LordTricky#7840
what new seed am i creating???
create new seed, custom, iguana(256 bits), waves, NXT
guessing iguana???

[05-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i dont think pub key is all thats needed, as anyone can go richlist and claim they own it all haha

[05-Jun-19 11:52 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Bastol which agama version are you using ?

[05-Jun-19 11:52 AM] bishop#9773
I'm most interested to see how this claiming from the safu fund is going to work... if it's message signing, it would be hard to see how that is going to work if seeds were compromised to generate private keys to specific addresses

[05-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i presume only 1 or a handful of people would be playing a part in this exploit (which has not affected komodo so far from what i gather)
Even if they got a handful of keys, (the vulnerable ones only) which were swept, they would need to validate them as their own, im sure the team have a way to figure out what goes to who.

Also opsec wise, isnt it just like a mass "jumblr" for everyone 😮

@PHBA2061 i uninstalled it, trying to restore seed in an eth wallet right now, any clue on the derivation path to use ?

by filling in the form, there asking for TXID, you need to fill in the very first transaction to your wallet?

@PHBA2061 i'm trying on www.myetherwallet.com but the adresses dont match, i need to add an HD derivation path

[05-Jun-19 12:00 PM] DLT Novice#2835
Does this exploit only effect kmd and agama coins? . Or other spv using coins and other projects?  Is there a list of potential effected projects so we can begin to secure them

[05-Jun-19 12:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bastol we are figuring out the way for eth
you can try hyperdex to import the agama seed and send to a new address

[05-Jun-19 12:02 PM] dxer666#8963
hyperdex  is safe?

[05-Jun-19 12:03 PM] Entity#5862
Is that “safe address” now holding over 10.000.000 In usd holy

[05-Jun-19 12:03 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Bastol I'll get back in several minutes

[05-Jun-19 12:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@DLT Novice 
it is not about spv servers
it is about the seed creation and validation in agama
this exploit was found by others outside the team and they informed us
so they would have informed other teams too if their wallets are affected
so you can only follow the instructions given by the respective teams
or you could be safe and transfer them all to paper wallets/ hard ware wallets
KMD team confirmed Verus agama is safe so that can be used for the coins available on it

[05-Jun-19 12:04 PM] Stock Chen#2347
How do I inquire? I have filled in the registration form.

[05-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jacman#4756
I also want to know the HD derived address.  Does anyone know?

[05-Jun-19 12:05 PM] LordTricky#7840
ok so i have created a new seed / wif with agama 0.6.0-13
do i now use this same version to log into my old seed / wif to move my coins to the new seed?

[05-Jun-19 12:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@LordTricky if you can use the old agama with the old seed(compromised) , use it to the Verus agama's address you just created

[05-Jun-19 12:06 PM] MrV#9757
I filled out the form as my funds were moved. I didn't see how the form proves ownership though and I wasn't sure which txs to provide, so I provided the out bound ones

[05-Jun-19 12:06 PM] LordTricky#7840
@gcharang  i deleted the old version of agama 😦 but is the new version safe to log into my old seed?

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] gcharang#6833
@jacman regarding moving ETH and ERC20, please wait, we are looking for a solution
hyperDEX might work to move them out
wse are looking into it

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] RycoPsycho#2361
what TXID do i need to fill in the form? the latest ones?

[05-Jun-19 12:07 PM] gcharang#6833

@gcharang yes i have the old seed, but curious as to why not log into it with the new version of agama?

[05-Jun-19 12:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@LordTricky you can use the old seed in Verus Agama but I don't think it can connect to KMD servers right now

[05-Jun-19 12:09 PM] LordTricky#7840
ahhhh i see, will give it a try thank you @gcharang   😃

The versus wallet is also called agama correct? That alone is confusing to me. don't use the official agama wallet but use the versus agama wallet...correct?

there is no mention  of anything else, and that seems the only obvious one to me

I found my KMD on my seed and moved them to my exchange after reading the announcements. Is there a way for me to store them on my Ledger S and stake them yet?

[05-Jun-19 12:18 PM] flick#6039
The version of VersusCoin Agama is "experimental". We should still use it???

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] flick#6039
Can we instead transfer the KMD to Ledger S?

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Mewnzter yep you can claim ledger

[05-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

@MrV ledger is safe

[05-Jun-19 12:27 PM] MrV#9757
Why no mention of it in the article? I would have tried to use my ledger instead of the experimental agama wallet to create a new account to provide in the form

so my funds are now sitting on a new seed created with agama v0.6.0.13PBaaS...... Are they now safe?

thank you @gcharang  i only held KMD 😃

downloaded verus ver 0.5.6a.dmg, do I run that or dl  0.6.0.13Pbaas?

@gcharang okay, thank you

[05-Jun-19 12:33 PM] gcharang#6833
@actionslacks use the 0.6.0.13Pbaas

[05-Jun-19 12:33 PM] flick#6039
Download VersusCoin/Agama Version v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-, then create a new address with it, log into the OLD Agama and send funds to the new address

[05-Jun-19 12:33 PM] flick#6039
correct?

[05-Jun-19 12:33 PM] LordTricky#7840
😮 maybe not, i also have  NINJA, PGT, VOTE2019 too, how do i move those too? same way as KMD?

[05-Jun-19 12:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@flick  correct

[05-Jun-19 12:34 PM] LordTricky#7840
hmmm no SPV for any of those 3?

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] flick#6039
just to confirm, if we instead use ledger s, we can later claim the 5% reward without moving the funds again, right?

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] gcharang#6833
@LordTricky move PGT, use the webwallet

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] flick#6039
also ledger s can store all other coins like NINJA, PGT, ... (LordTricky mentioned)

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] flick#6039
?

[05-Jun-19 12:35 PM] mrlynch#5735
@flick yes.. see post above on how to claim rewards on a ledger

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Andy#1801
Is there any public information about the exploit that was used?

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@flick you’ll need to get private key out of ledger in future to do so. Easier to use verus coin wallet for assetchain

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
other coins no

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Andy not yet

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] gcharang#6833
@flick make sure the ledger seed you are using hasn't been entered into agama
the ledger address can store them all but to access them you will still need to use desktop wallets

[05-Jun-19 12:36 PM] LordTricky#7840
@gcharang how to use webwallet for PGT please, its not in the list?

[05-Jun-19 12:37 PM] LordTricky#7840
or do i log in to KMD spv and add PGT?
