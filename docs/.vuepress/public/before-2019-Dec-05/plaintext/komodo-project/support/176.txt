Hi there!

[15-Sep-19 08:25 PM] Equihashing Anonto#6242
I have a basic question!

[15-Sep-19 08:26 PM] Equihashing Anonto#6242
Revenue of a particular miner = hashing rate of that miner √∑ net difficulty hashrate √ó Block reward √ó Block time √ó  Coin price.

[15-Sep-19 08:26 PM] Equihashing Anonto#6242
Is this above equation is valid?

[16-Sep-19 10:49 PM] ballistic#2323
@hyperDEX i heard it used to compromise your keys possibly

[17-Sep-19 08:24 AM] phideas#8309
@ballistic in early days it was not possible to claim rewards on ledger. only way to get accrued rewards, if user ‚Äúwillingly‚Äú extracted his privkeys, then reset his ledger to a new seed.
today there is a safe and user friendly solution https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/ or using magnum web wallet.

I recently switched to a new computer and I wanted to install the latest Agama/Komodo wallet.  On my old computer I used an old version of the Agama wallet in Lite mode so I only have a seed phrase and password.  How do you recommend I proceed to recover my Komodo funds?  I tried unsuccessfully in the past using what was an old version of Agama.  Would appreciate some help.  Thanks

[26-Sep-19 05:02 PM] FredR#1778
Actually, I need to install the latest Agama/Komodo wallet first.  Hopefully I can recover access using the seed phrase and password.  The only Agama desktop wallet I've seen requires a command line approach.

[26-Sep-19 05:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@FredR just the seed phrase should be enough

[30-Sep-19 05:18 AM] Oszy#5734
@![HATCH] Hatch you have to apply for listing and probably pay the listing fee, since you have a DASH fork, technically it's possible. Fill out the contact form on atomicdex.io under "Assets"

[30-Sep-19 05:18 AM] peepypoopy#4480
Any admin/support?

[30-Sep-19 05:20 AM] Oszy#5734
@peepypoopy  make sure you enter the seed without extra characters / spaces at the end of the seed, you only get different address if it's not the exact same seed. you can check balance for your address on https://kmdexplorer.io if you see your funds there, you are entering the wrong seed.

It happens a lot that people mistype a word, or press space twice somewhere, which will result in a different address in lite mode. Besides your seed,  it's recommended to have a backup of that address's private key which you can export in Agama from the settings.

[30-Sep-19 05:28 AM] ![HATCH] Hatch#3230
@Oszy Thank you. Yes, HATCH fork DASH, like any other coin using the X11 algorithm, but we have a lot of changes, including the use of our signature. Unlike other X11 projects that use the DASH signature, and their cost is 100 times higher than HATCH. We are looking for integration opportunities without listing fees. We corresponded with the guys from AtomicDEX but to no avail. It all ended at the cost of integration. Therefore, we decided to contact you directly.

[30-Sep-19 05:37 AM] peepypoopy#4480
@Oszy I enter my agama address into the explorer and the tokens are there. I enter my seed, I diligently write down all my seeds for wallets, and the address showing is differentü§î I would never have created a wallet without writing down the seed so I do not understand what is going on

[30-Sep-19 05:39 AM] peepypoopy#4480
This all happened after komodo warned us they had hacked their own wallet and we were told to download a new version or something
