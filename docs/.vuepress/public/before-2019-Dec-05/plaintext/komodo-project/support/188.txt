agama doesn't support an extra passphrase for bip39 seeds nor it can login with bip39 seed
settings -> bip39 is similar to https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ tool, only good to obtain priv keys
if you're trying to access any substantial funds i'd strongly recommend to avoid using hot wallets

I'm asked how to send eth from "agama verus" to another wallet without having gas?

[18-Nov-19 03:51 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
ETH requires Gas, wo without Gas, no transaction.

[18-Nov-19 03:54 PM] sœÜldat#8733
how do you add gas to agama verus then?

[18-Nov-19 03:58 PM] Oszy#5734
you add more eth

[18-Nov-19 04:22 PM] Arno#3334
Hi, I have a question regarding the claiming of the active user rewards: Is there kind of a "special" transaction necessary to claim the accrued rewards (i.e. a wallet feature), or is it simply a regular transaction of the max funds to the same address that you're sending from, and in that case automatically claimed?

[18-Nov-19 04:23 PM] Arno#3334
I mean, does the process of claiming has to be "triggered" by the wallet somehow, or is it being done automatically?

[18-Nov-19 04:30 PM] Oszy#5734
claiming is basically sending the funds to yourself to the same address, if you send to another address, the reward will be added to the first address.

[18-Nov-19 04:33 PM] Arno#3334
So I could use the magnumwallet (which doesn't explicitly support or feature a "claiming" option) along with the Trezor hardware wallet, and simply send the max funds to my same address, and this will automatically send me the accrued rewards on top of the sent balance?

[18-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Oszy#5734
correct

[18-Nov-19 04:34 PM] Oszy#5734
in magnum there is a claim button btw

(I'm asking for the ideal scenario for Trezor wallet including reward claiming)

[18-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Arno#3334
Thanks, I'll try that as soon as there are some rewards to be claimed.

[18-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Oszy#5734
ummmmmmmm

[18-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Oszy#5734
I am not sure if it works with Trezos, it does with Ledger

[18-Nov-19 04:38 PM] Arno#3334
Yes, that's the big question.

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Oszy#5734
Not all 3rd party wallets set locktime, and as a result, you may not accrue rewards ...

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Arno#3334
So far, the button "claim rewards" is greyed out here, but it may be due to insufficient rewards.

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Oszy#5734
If that's what you were asking

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Arno#3334
I'll collect some, and then will try it.

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Arno#3334
But Trezor does set the locktime, that's what I've found out so far.

[18-Nov-19 04:40 PM] Oszy#5734
Then it should be okay. That's the only "technical" implication behind it.

[18-Nov-19 04:40 PM] Arno#3334
ok

[18-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Arno#3334
That's why I was asking about the "regular" transaction to oneself versus a special "claim" triggering option.

[18-Nov-19 04:43 PM] Oszy#5734
the claim itself isn't "triggered" but the UTXO has to have locktime set when received.

[18-Nov-19 04:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@Arno you can check if your address is generating rewards or not: <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards>
> That's why I was asking about the "regular" transaction to oneself versus a special "claim" triggering option

it is just a regular transaction to your self. but, the wallet has to be aware that it can send more than there are available coins and send them. i.e., the fee is negative
komodo daemon(node) and agama wallet, ocean qt wallet, all do it 

 as shown in that blog post, magnum seems to support claiming rewards but I am not 100% sure if magnum with trezor can do it
the best solution is directly ask the magnum guys <https://discordapp.com/invite/GZPngxY>

[18-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Is there any site now that shows how many atomic swaps are occurring?

[18-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
kind of like how dexstats.info used to

[18-Nov-19 07:46 PM] Arno#3334
@gcharang Thanks for the info. I've tried again and compared it to magnumwallet's own internal KMD addresses: with those it is possible to claim rewards, but with the addresses linked to Trezor, the claim feature is simply missing from the menu. I've spoken to the magnumwallet support and they've confirmed this. There is still no good reason in my view to have this feature disabled for Trezor-linked wallets since the only requirement is the locktime, which trezor actually supports. It seems to me more like that a developer has simply put a condition like "if trezor, then remove claim feature" even though it would perfectly work.

[18-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Arno#3334
So I'm still looking for the ideal KMD wallet connected to Trezor that actually supports the rewards claiming. Your mentioned wallets that support the claiming all do not seem to work with Trezor, do they?

[18-Nov-19 07:52 PM] Arno#3334
(komodo daemon, agama wallet, ocean qt wallet)

[18-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Ok after following the guide to resync my wallet from scratch (deleting the necessary files/folders) it slowed down to a crawl at around 15%

[18-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
so i tried the bootstrap

[18-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
and now it just seems to be stuck on "rescanning blocks"

[18-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
it was updating percentage earlier but now it is not anymore

[18-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Sdunbar#5064
native mode verus agama

[18-Nov-19 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It was at rescanning blocks for a while for me too

[18-Nov-19 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10 mins maybe

[18-Nov-19 10:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then boom 99.9% synched

[18-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
ah ok.. just the fact its not updating percentage anymore and doesnt show it is concerning

[18-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
also its been at it for a couple hours now

[18-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
last i was it was around 6.5% rescanned

[18-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
at that rate it will be a few days

[18-Nov-19 10:22 PM] Sdunbar#5064
assuming it is working at all

[18-Nov-19 11:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Restarted agama and now its back to 4.05%

[18-Nov-19 11:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Is that normal? Seems like this could take a week

[18-Nov-19 11:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
if it doesnt get stuck again and reset

[18-Nov-19 11:47 PM] rezz#7108
Recently filed claim to get my KMD to new address due to issues related to June incident. I have transferred the small amount of KMD that was deposited to my old wallet and entered the new wallet address in the claim form. Have not received the KMD to my new address yet, it's been about a week now.

[19-Nov-19 12:27 AM] SHossain#0007
the claims are now processed within 2-4 weeks time

[19-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Still having problems with this rescan in agama

[19-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
should i delete it all and start again?

[19-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
stops working about about 6-7%

[19-Nov-19 12:35 AM] mrlynch#5735

Yeah

[19-Nov-19 12:43 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I'll let this rescan run a bit longer i guess and see if it does anything

[19-Nov-19 12:43 AM] Sdunbar#5064
pretty sure it's stuck again though

[19-Nov-19 12:50 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ah actually it is still doing something afterall

[19-Nov-19 12:50 AM] Sdunbar#5064
popped up at 9.85% now

[19-Nov-19 12:50 AM] Sdunbar#5064
going to be a long haul but as long as it's working I'm happy

[19-Nov-19 06:56 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Ok it worked

[19-Nov-19 06:56 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Just a question though.. last time I claimed interest was july 7th

[19-Nov-19 06:57 AM] Sdunbar#5064
now i've accumulated 22 KMD interest since then that i have not claimed.. but it seems it should be a lot more

[19-Nov-19 06:57 AM] Sdunbar#5064
did the interest structure change at some point?

[19-Nov-19 07:00 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i think my interest for that period should be around 5 times that amount

[19-Nov-19 07:04 AM] Sdunbar#5064
seems like my interest is not increasing with new blocks right now either

[19-Nov-19 07:07 AM] Sdunbar#5064
oh i see it stops accumulating after a month

[19-Nov-19 07:07 AM] Sdunbar#5064
damn didnt realize that

[19-Nov-19 07:07 AM] Sdunbar#5064
cost myself quite a lot lol

[19-Nov-19 07:07 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i think it used to be a year?

[19-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah but now claim monthly and you get 5.1% rewards yearly

[19-Nov-19 09:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@Arno
> since the only requirement is the locktime
locktime exists in most of the bitcoin forks; but the reward claiming is unique to KMD and as far as I know it is not implemented in trezor hw yet
> It seems to me more like that a developer has simply put a condition like "if trezor, then remove claim feature" even though it would perfectly work
this is not true. in a hardware wallet like trezor, transaction signing and validation is done on the hw itself;
to support KMD rewards, the trezor formware itself needs to be updated (to allow sending of "more" coins than already exist)
I think it is currently in development
once it gets added to Trezor, any of the third party wallets (like magnum) will be able to enable reward claim with trezor
