[06-Jun-19 08:29 PM] CarloP#0556
Thank you @SHossain

[06-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Zaddex discord isn't helping so I was wondering if someone could help me out What do I do if both Verus and old agama are running the zex chain and not zexo? I have funds in a non-verus agama seed rn and I want to get it to a verus secured wallet; however when I go to send I cannot as my blockchain isn't fully synced its stuck on the zex:zexo fork block. WAT DO

[06-Jun-19 08:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Supposedly the only version of agama that supports zexo is 0.3.6b and I do not have that version and the site has removed all links. As of right now my zexo is still on the zex chain prior to the fork, and I cannot activate the zexo chain with any of my versions of agama, so I cannot send to a verus secured address because the chain isn't synced

[06-Jun-19 08:45 PM] Oszy#5734
@Bernz - Selling LABS Did you try this Verus-Agama? https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
I don't have any zex so can't say it works but maybe

That is for pBaaS testing Im not sure I would want to send to that

[06-Jun-19 08:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bernz - Selling LABS our team has verified this version is safe and you can use it

[06-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
That version still uses ZEX

[06-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
And I am still stuck on block 259733, the date of the harkfork to zexo

[06-Jun-19 08:54 PM] gcharang#6833
OS?

[06-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
10

[06-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
When I launch the version I was using prior to the fork, my funds are there but if I send them a caution appears and the funds return to my wallet, cant send till I get zexo chain

[06-Jun-19 08:57 PM] plum58#2935

ping me after you run fetch-params script

[06-Jun-19 09:01 PM] nasbats#7785
Hey, I'm just getting to this now. You've swept multiple coins of mine into your safe address. When filling out the claim form, should I do a new one for each coin, so that the txids line up?

[06-Jun-19 09:03 PM] gcharang#6833
@nasbats new one for each coin

[06-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Tantale#1431
Is there also a claim for CHIPS? Mine are now in the safe adress, but the form says I cannot claim CHIPS?

[06-Jun-19 09:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
do users still need assistance with chips? just got back at my station and i see that chips funds have been swept by the team as well

[06-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Tantale#1431
Thanks!

[06-Jun-19 09:10 PM] gcharang#6833
@mrlynch it would be best if you could write it, some funds wouldn't have moved by the team, but the user will want to move them

[06-Jun-19 09:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok, doing it now

[06-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
@gcharang I have no idea what do for the fetch params, I have the zcash params and komodo.conf file already.. Do you want me to download the kmd chain now?

[06-Jun-19 09:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bernz - Selling LABS you already used native mode correct, sorry I forgot

[06-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Easteregg69#4081
How long before you return my funds? Form filled.

[06-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Could be awhile

[06-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Easteregg69#4081

Today at the station I took suitcase away of a man looking into the wrong direction to prevent someone stealing it. Now the thiefs can not steal it anymore and if the guy wants his suitcase back he only needs to fill a form. I'm a hero in crime prevention. Applause?

[06-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I don‚Äôt speak for the team, they have a lot to sort through @Easteregg69

[06-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Easteregg69#4081
Ok.

[06-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Warkid terrible analogy

[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Warkid#2117
By the way, how many Komodo have been stolen? Apart from the Komodo team certainly.

[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
More like tackling someone just before a sniper takes his shot

[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1 Million apparently

[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Easteregg69#4081
Warkid. That wallet is mess.

[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So would you rather the team get it first and then give it back to you, or lose your coin forever

[06-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[06-Jun-19 09:23 PM] Warkid#2117
I bought Komodo cause I wanted to use the decentral exchange. What decentral exchange? Barterdex?

[06-Jun-19 09:23 PM] Warkid#2117

[06-Jun-19 09:27 PM] kalfster#2695
hi, i hope someone can answer this, about a year ago i used the built in option in agama to extract a key from an address with a 24 word seed. I have not used the 24 word seed for anything else in Agama since. Is that 24 word seed still safe ?

[06-Jun-19 09:31 PM] sbucks#9553
@gcharang does the ocean-qt store kmd chains?  also, do i just download the kmd bootstrap for the ocean-qt wallet too?

[06-Jun-19 09:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@sbucks yes and yes

[06-Jun-19 09:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@kalfster it should be safe but I would recommend you move them to new seed by following the steps: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/429676282196787200/586115265545371648

[06-Jun-19 09:32 PM] sbucks#9553
do i need to download the bootstaps for the other kmd chains too for the ocean wallet?

[06-Jun-19 09:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
@sbucks yes if you don't want to wait for it to sync

[06-Jun-19 09:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No the more recent agama wallets were ‚Äúupstreamed‚Äù, a dependency was poisoned that revealed privkeys in some manner

[06-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Team got wind of it and acted to use collected stash of privkeys to steal coins first

[06-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

ty

[06-Jun-19 09:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I assume it was a hacker-collected stash on some remote server, maybe it wasn‚Äôt secured by the hacker and that‚Äôs how the team was able to fight back
