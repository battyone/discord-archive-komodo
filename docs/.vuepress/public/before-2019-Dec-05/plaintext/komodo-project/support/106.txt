@Bob Sandvich you don‚Äôt need to sync

[05-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just using the new address which You will import into new kmd wallet once it comes out

[05-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
As long as you keep the priv key of wallet created outside of agama Komodo you‚Äôll be fine

[05-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Bob Sandvich#9974
Okay, thanks.

VersusCoin Agama asks for ZCah Params Fetch

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] flick#6039
"Komodod Zcash params are missing or incomple"

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] flick#6039
is this normal?!

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
you will need to download zcash params

[05-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yep that‚Äôs fine @flick

@Bob Sandvich The error you show in above screenshot is fixed if you install an other version of the Verus Agama wallet. You need to download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview

open a terminal and navigate to Downloads folder
```cd Downloads```
make file executable
```chmod +x fetch-params.sh```
run file
```./fetch-params.sh```

[05-Jun-19 12:45 PM] LordTricky#7840
no ninja or vote2019 servers?

[05-Jun-19 12:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
those are non-essential at the moment

[05-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Both worthless coins

[05-Jun-19 12:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
vote2019 is useless anyway, ninja was used as a test

[05-Jun-19 12:45 PM] LordTricky#7840

[05-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Jurjen#9294
With the Agama wallet I have to activate coins. Is there a way to see which coins I have used or are added by airdrops or so, which still stores some value without activating each coin?

[05-Jun-19 12:53 PM] gcharang#6833
@flick what exactly do you need to do?

Thanks

[05-Jun-19 12:55 PM] flick#6039
@gcharang VersusCoin agama asked for some zcash key with 3 or so options to download them from somewhere. I used option 1. Then the same message came again. After restarting Agama, I could now log in.

[05-Jun-19 12:55 PM] flick#6039
@gcharang Trying to close the wallet now because it started in native mode. Now it hangs for minutes already......

[05-Jun-19 12:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you already downloaded them then you're fine

[05-Jun-19 12:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@flick the params are only needed for native mode, which you dont need right now
you can just close the wallet and open it again in lite mode

[05-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
You only need to use verus for making an address and saving private keys

[05-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Won‚Äôt need to ever open it again or load it up

[05-Jun-19 12:57 PM] gcharang#6833
@Dany_sof are your funds in your old address or are they moved out?

[05-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Pringle#4720
anyone having sync issues with the VRSC agama app?

[05-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Pringle no need to sync

[05-Jun-19 12:58 PM] flick#6039
@gcharang Should I log in with my old seed into VersusCoin Agama?

[05-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Jurjen#9294
@gcharang It seems that https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php is not fully working. For example it shows my BTC & KMD correct values, but my CCL value is empty, while if I add it to Agama it shows the correct value. Also I don't see ETH and some ohters in the list for example.

[05-Jun-19 12:58 PM] flick#6039
@gcharang Or should I only create a new seed in VersusCoin, then log in into the old Agama and transfer the funds from there?

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@flick option 2 easiest

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Pringle#4720
@Crabby Paddy if we can't sync then how will we send and recieve?

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] flick#6039
@Crabby Paddy What do you mean?

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Analyser.#1300
hey team ! thank you for making a clear and simple post .... we understand nothing. Thx

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] flick#6039
Can we still log into the old agama or should we avoid that completely?

[05-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Pringle use litemode. You only need verus to make new address safely

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
New agama wallet will be out where you can import the safe address

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@flick no issues with logging in

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Analyser.#1300
my balance is empty.

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Analyser. read up it was most likely sent to one of 2 addresses

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Which are safe

[05-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Entity#5862
Ditto, and we get a fing google doc... To send data some data that proves im the owner.

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] neo#6247

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Should be fine @.üê≥üëªüçÑ. noob kraken .üêôüê†. but safest to just move them anyway

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Entity#5862
Neo what address did your got send to?

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Pringle#4720
@Crabby Paddy  yes I use lite mode and i get 'connection error! Trying to switch to another server'

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yep don‚Äôt need to sync @Pringle

[05-Jun-19 01:01 PM] neo#6247
@Entity one second

Just copy pub and priv key

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Of that address. Store safely

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Send coins into it. And import private key into the new wallet coming out

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Pringle#4720
ok

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
No need to send from verus, and receiving is fine without it

[05-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Pringle#4720
Do you have any idea about NINJA?

[05-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Test coin

@Entity @Pringle @Crabby Paddy   looks like mine were stolen and sent to this address RHVQvQ4nkHPF23bJuzfaaSSwkqyGhm7PGc

[05-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Pringle#4720
@neo what's your address?

[05-Jun-19 01:04 PM] PD#1377
What if destination address is NOT one of the two they said funds went too?

[05-Jun-19 01:04 PM] flick#6039
"Please select compatible wallet seed type", what to select???

[05-Jun-19 01:04 PM] gcharang#6833
@neo the funds are safe. in the next hop they were sent to safe address. please fill the claim form

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] gcharang#6833
@PD you have to trace the final destination

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
@PD please check on explorer where they ended up

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Entity#5862
Not to be an asshole

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Entity#5862
But I can now fill in Neo's claim

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] technofloof#8761
@PD i am in the same boat i assume that it jumped a few wallets

[05-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Entity#5862
And get his coins?
