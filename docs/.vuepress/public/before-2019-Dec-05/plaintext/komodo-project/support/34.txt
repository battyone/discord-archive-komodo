Desktop is just CLI.

[07-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Hermes#6934
Desktop already encountered the issue again?

[07-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Desktop's Agama doesn't work. Has the "getDashboardUpdate failed" error.

[07-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Laptop has extremely slow syncing.

[07-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I should be okay to reinstall Agama on the desktop now.

[07-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I didn't install it in the /opt/ directory originally, so I wonder if that's related.

[07-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The laptop was installed correctly, so I don't know why that one's syncing so slowl

[07-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
reinstalling on the desktop fixed the `getDashboardUpdate` error, so that's good.

[07-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just the slowly syncing laptop to solve.

[07-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
If you installed the wallet normally and made this dependency it should surely work

[07-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Hermes#6934
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4 libcurl3

[07-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Hermes#6934
before launching it download the dependency above

[07-Sep-18 01:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I'll check. I believe I did. It wouldn't have installed on the laptop, otherwise, right?

[07-Sep-18 01:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, they're already installed

[07-Sep-18 01:39 AM] Hermes#6934
after the reinstall in the correct folder still having the dashboard error can you please send us a screenshot here

[07-Sep-18 01:39 AM] Hermes#6934

@SHossain 
I'm working on documentation, trying to clarify it.

I have this section here, and I'm doing something wrong with the JSON input. Can you help me?

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getaddresstxids '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb","RQUAkqRiRMqxcNrB29B4duTK4qkqfV9HVJ"],5,200}'

error: Error JSON:{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb","RQUAkqRiRMqxcNrB29B4duTK4qkqfV9HVJ"],5,200}
```

[07-Sep-18 10:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It seems like a simple fix.

[07-Sep-18 10:29 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus I think that `getaddresstxids` accept only addresses as input
Try this way:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getaddresstxids '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb","RQUAkqRiRMqxcNrB29B4duTK4qkqfV9HVJ"]}'```

[07-Sep-18 10:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, okay

[07-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL The old documentation (I'm working on rewriting it) says that there's a start/end position.

Same for `getaddressdeltas`.

In both cases, I don't seem to be able to submit the start and end points.

[07-Sep-18 10:30 PM] TonyL#3577
hmm, yes https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/komodo-API.html#getaddresstxids can see there start and end blocks but can't see any working example

[07-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yep, I'm looking to write one.

[07-Sep-18 10:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus I guess I've solved this quizz
```./komodo-cli getaddresstxids '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb","RQUAkqRiRMqxcNrB29B4duTK4qkqfV9HVJ"],"start":1,"end":2}'
```

[07-Sep-18 10:38 PM] TonyL#3577
"start" (number) means "start":number

I gather there are some issues with Agama atm? My windows desktop agama wont launch. should i wait for an update?

[08-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Tripper#1636
I have 2.41d already

[08-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No issues here

[08-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Tripper#1636
Was working before. all i did was update

[08-Sep-18 11:58 AM] yorklab#7270
Mine works fine. Maybe try re-installing?

[08-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Tripper#1636
doing it again now

[08-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Hermes#6934
Make sure that the previous instance of Agama was closed correctly

[09-Sep-18 11:48 AM] Tripper#1636
Have updated my agama wallet for windows several times and keep getting the same error. It says 'Javascript error occured in the main process'. Suggestions please

@Tripper Try looking here and see if that helps:

@Tripper  please send us a support ticket at support@komodoplatform.com with the screenshot of the JavaScript error also make sure you have the newest JavaScript library installed

[09-Sep-18 06:06 PM] konikaze#2898
trying to exchange kmd for doge, got a "trade executed" message, but no transaction history or pending operation I can see. please advise.

[09-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you using Barterdex? Check oder status and see if you have a green check mark or a blue mark next to the order

[09-Sep-18 06:14 PM] konikaze#2898
Yes, sorry. I am using BarterDEX. I see no entries under Trade Status, My Offers, or Trade History. Is "Order Status" a literal title? I am not seeing it in the interface. Thanks.

[09-Sep-18 06:14 PM] konikaze#2898
I still have all my KMD, its like nothing happened.

[09-Sep-18 06:16 PM] konikaze#2898
I also wasn't able to use the Inventory function earlier, but finally got a "Trade Executed" response after sending 3 spendable KMD transactions to my wallet.

[09-Sep-18 06:26 PM] konikaze#2898
weird, all the KMD<->doge items are showing anymore

[09-Sep-18 06:26 PM] konikaze#2898
btc, bhc is still showing, maybe the seller dropped out? weird coincidence

[09-Sep-18 06:27 PM] konikaze#2898
back now, idk

[09-Sep-18 06:28 PM] konikaze#2898
> couldnt connect to electrum server.

[09-Sep-18 06:28 PM] konikaze#2898
when I tried again

[09-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Hermes#6934
most likely the trade never started,

[09-Sep-18 06:33 PM] konikaze#2898
that last message has me thinking I need a native mode for doge and/or kmd

[09-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Hermes#6934
native is faster for doing trades, I will recommend it over electrum

[09-Sep-18 06:45 PM] Hermes#6934
if you can do it try it.

[09-Sep-18 06:45 PM] konikaze#2898
makes sense. would be nice to use electrum or at least know which or if both coins needed it

[09-Sep-18 06:45 PM] konikaze#2898
ill follow up if that doesnt work, thanks

[09-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Hermes#6934
I will suggest using both in native ,

[09-Sep-18 09:41 PM] zeehenk#4990
Are holders on ledger OK after the block 1milion? Read that it was fine, but unsure now for some reason.

[09-Sep-18 09:48 PM] Hermes#6934
They haven't confirmed that they have updated their wallet, but they have already been informed and already acknowledged  it.  For now if you have your funds inside their wallet they are safe , we hope to get an update from them soon.

[10-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Tripper#1636
Thanks for the reply Hermes and Yorklab. When trying to figure this out before I deleted all data when I did the uninstall. There is no appdata file in my *username* file and I'm guessing this is why?? Hermes you mentioned the newest javascript library. I searched but it seems a bit above my head. Can you recommend one please? Cheers

[10-Sep-18 09:04 AM] Seko#7408
With which wallets besides Agama can we claim?

[10-Sep-18 09:09 AM] TonyL#3577
@Seko Even with paper wallet you can. Most important thing is transaction with `locktime` parameter. Then you unlock it by spend transaction. Agama simplifies this process with button which sending transaction to yourself

[10-Sep-18 09:11 AM] Seko#7408
Thx TonyL...I‚Äòm writing an article about rewards and more. And now the question is, is there another wallet with a claim-button?

[10-Sep-18 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@Tripper Are you installing latest version from https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/ after Appdata/Roaming/Agama folder cleaning and uninstallation?

@Seko Hmm not sure about it for 100%, but don't think so

[10-Sep-18 09:13 AM] Seko#7408
I know that claiming is also possible via the ledger. I will also consider the topic in the article. I'm looking for the simplest methods. Almost the GUI. Is there more than Agama?

[10-Sep-18 09:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I think only Agama/Agama forks have such button since it's a very specific thing

[10-Sep-18 09:16 AM] Seko#7408
Chainzilla builds the Chameleon app. All of this informations I need for an article in German...

[10-Sep-18 09:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Chameleon app is an Agama fork so it'll have this button I guess

[10-Sep-18 09:17 AM] Seko#7408

If this is the wrong place to ask, please accept my apologies and point me in the right direction but, I do not seem to have any  Zilla following the airdrop. Had about 140k KMD in wallet at the time.  Synced the chain, still nothing. Anyone?

[11-Sep-18 06:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@RJF the ZILLA coins should be in the same address as your KMD. please check your address in this explorer https://zilla.kmdexplorer.io/

[11-Sep-18 09:44 PM] Elmis#0347
Maybe it's something similar to what happened to me, I had 26000 kmd in a native wallet and the airdrop has sent the zillas to an address that is supposedly mine but which I do not have access from my native wallet so strangely the zillas are out of my possibilities of using them, for me they have been lost. It's hard to understand but it's reality. If you @SHossain kows the way to find they, please tell me haw

[11-Sep-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the address?

[11-Sep-18 09:45 PM] SHossain#0007
@Elmis ^^

[11-Sep-18 09:51 PM] Elmis#0347
my kmd address is     RA9G36WwA9K95bn8Cbycq5ZnoxhSzzhhBw and  te airdrop send the zillas to RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N that is an address I cant see in my wallet

[11-Sep-18 09:53 PM] Hermes#6934
You have the private key for that address in native mode already, you can export it and use it in Zilla on native mode or even just using that same private key as a seed in lite mode

[11-Sep-18 09:54 PM] Hermes#6934
next to the public address select export Wif  keys and with this private key you can have access to your funds by importing them into native or using that same WIF as a seed in lite mode with Zilla

[11-Sep-18 10:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@Elmis you had 26k KMD in this address RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N until August 23 https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/d00eec91fa1737a67b1832517f442672739d2295f37f5d7b5d46c4c5b99a4fc5

[11-Sep-18 10:02 PM] SHossain#0007
you can find the address in your native wallet, get the privkey of `RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N` and import privkey key in ZILLA native mode or login with the privkey into Lite mode. and, you will have access to your ZILLA funds.

[11-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Elmis#0347
My address is RA9G36WwA9K95bn8Cbycq5ZnoxhSzzhhBw and when I use the private key to open agama lite I have my agama wallet with my kmd and when I open Zilla the zilla address is also RA9G36WwA9K95bn8Cbycq5ZnoxhSzzhhBw and the balance is 0.

[11-Sep-18 10:33 PM] Elmis#0347
I cant fund the address  RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N in my wallet using native or lite

[11-Sep-18 10:57 PM] Hermes#6934
If I recall correctly the Zilla  snapshot for the airdrop was on the 15 th so your Zilla should be in this address  as seen in this explorer https://zillaexplorer.io/address/RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N You can do a rescan to see  this pub key in your wallet and finish the process described above with just selecting the export WIF option as showed in this guide . https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/1179728/Rescan+Wallet+with+Agama ,    But also a fastest way to get this private key for the address would be using this methods as showed below. Go to settings and select wallet.dat keys then select KMD and put your pub key RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N  and select Get Keys or go to CLI select KMD and do this command dumpprivkey RAceRPKD5ySpUmy9Lwp4cKRiP8JA8uiK8N and you should be able to get the priv keys and manage your funds.
