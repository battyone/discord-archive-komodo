ssh-copy-id demo@198.51.100.0

[13-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Exile13#4458
the guide was linked from kmd

[13-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Exile13#4458
or is it a local ip

[13-Apr-19 08:02 PM] LeshAft9#0083
the ip of the machine where you have an account with password auth and you want to enable ssh auth from your local machine where you have the ssh private key, if that describes your situation

[13-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Exile13#4458
`the ip of the machine where you have an account with password auth`
and this is the gathered from the local network im on, either wifi or lan correct? @LeshAft9

[13-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Exile13#4458
for instance if i ran `ifconfig`

[13-Apr-19 09:06 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I don't think I understand your situation

[13-Apr-19 09:07 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Why are you setting up ssh-keys @Exile13 ? do you have a digital ocean instance that you want to ssh into?

[13-Apr-19 09:09 PM] Exile13#4458
i dont need them for a kmd node locally?/

[13-Apr-19 09:11 PM] LeshAft9#0083
Probably not. Are you running it locally in a virtual machine, or what? are you using a a mac or linux computer?

[13-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Exile13#4458
new laptop i loaded ubuntu on

[13-Apr-19 09:12 PM] LeshAft9#0083
and you're running the node natively

[13-Apr-19 09:12 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I don't think you need to involve ssh in that case

[13-Apr-19 09:12 PM] LeshAft9#0083
ssh is for connecting to a remote machine, such as if you run your node on a digital ocean instance in the cloud. then you use ssh to connect to that machine to run commands on the command line

[13-Apr-19 09:13 PM] LeshAft9#0083
and when you connect to a remote machine, you can use a password, but it is best practice to set it up to use ssh key to authenticate and disable password. that's probably what that section of the guide is about

[13-Apr-19 09:17 PM] Exile13#4458
so it would be beneficial to run ssh on this if i intend on accessing it when im not here

[13-Apr-19 09:18 PM] LeshAft9#0083
you want to remotely connect to your laptop computer from somewhere else?

[13-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Exile13#4458
im jumping headfirst into waters in have little knowledge about i appreciate you

[13-Apr-19 09:18 PM] Exile13#4458
perhaps

[13-Apr-19 09:19 PM] LeshAft9#0083
if it is on your home network with a router then you would have to enable port forwarding in order to have an incoming request reach the laptop

[13-Apr-19 09:21 PM] LeshAft9#0083
which might be a PITA since your laptop probably uses DHCP and so has a dynamically assigned address, although it might stick. but still it might not be worth it unless you're just looking for the learning experience. in which case you can sign up for a free micro instance for a year on AWS and learn about how to ssh into that, it will have a static public IP address

[13-Apr-19 09:22 PM] LeshAft9#0083
or you can just ssh from the laptop to itself, for kicks. and even enable ssh key auth

[13-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Exile13#4458
ya i wanna break as much as i can

[13-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Exile13#4458
lol

[13-Apr-19 09:22 PM] Exile13#4458
and learn

[13-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Exile13#4458
i installed ubuntu and it took like 6 hours to turn the wifi on

[13-Apr-19 09:23 PM] LeshAft9#0083
ouch

[13-Apr-19 09:23 PM] LeshAft9#0083
I would have thought it's better by now

[13-Apr-19 09:23 PM] Exile13#4458
had to tether my phone eventually

[13-Apr-19 09:25 PM] Exile13#4458
ya as of two fridays ago im learning cli as much as i can

This walkthrough explains a bit more with regards to logging in

[13-Apr-19 11:00 PM] penguin#0544
you can also use PuTTY to generate ssh keys

[13-Apr-19 11:02 PM] penguin#0544
Ubuntu's ufw is a simple option for basic security as well

Hey, anyone want to teach newbie how to mine kmd? I'd like to participate but I'm not as computer savy as needed. Google can only answer so much. I've figured it 0.25/day on a GPU I need an Asic minor. looking at $1700 antminers and such and dont want to drop $ on hardware not knowing what the hell I'm doing. I'd like to DM someone who can answer a few questions in laymens terms. Any volunteers? or at least links to help? specific for MacOS and KMD, VRSC, and/or ARRR mining?

I‚Äòve got a problem here guys.
Sent funds from Agama to my Ledger, then Agama showed some Error regarding Electrum, the notification was gone too quick so i couldn‚Äòt write it down. I went on to see if the funds arrived on my ledger, they didn‚Äòt. Ledger says ‚ÄûSync Error, A Re-Org may have occured‚Äú Block Explorer shows that TX was confirmed though, can anyone help?

[14-Apr-19 10:14 PM] PTYX#6840
@KMDlzrd look at the address on the kmdexplorer.io and see if the funds left your ledger address

[14-Apr-19 10:14 PM] PTYX#6840
I've had ledger show me an error but the tx still gone through

[14-Apr-19 10:16 PM] KMDlzrd#5075
Funds arrived according to Block Explorer

[14-Apr-19 10:17 PM] KMDlzrd#5075
They‚Äòre still on the ledger address

[14-Apr-19 10:21 PM] KMDlzrd#5075
I resolved it, clearing cache on my ledger helped & my wallet is synced again!

Hi! I tried to claim the kmd rewards using https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/, but I got less coins than there were before claiming. Did anyone experience this? Why does this happen?

[19-Apr-19 08:21 AM] zatJUM#9924
@Rob You probably have the missing coins in another address now

[19-Apr-19 09:00 AM] Rob#2708
I see. How can I check which addresses have coins if I use a NanoS? In the ledger live app, after claiming, it only shows a lower received amount then sent. The claim consists of 2 transactions, should there be more?

[19-Apr-19 09:09 AM] zatJUM#9924
Is your komodo app on ledger up to date?

[19-Apr-19 09:10 AM] zatJUM#9924
It works fine for me (I have komodo 1.3.7 on my nanoS)

[19-Apr-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
also gotta consider the dev fee (5% of reward https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim#usage ) and txfee (generally 0.0001 KMD unless it is a very large tx) when claiming. 
It's recommended to not process a claim unless you have less than 0.01 KMD in rewards pending

I read on the update that z transactions was discontinued earlier this year

KMD itself is transparent only, if you want privacy i recommend to use PIRATE

Great jobs done by Komodo team and unfortunately we can only support the ideea and the project by using and learn about Blockchain and understand the fundamentals of this project, getting more knowledge you can't be tricked by all this scams projects,just few hours ago I read a article about IOST-IOST has become one of the Big 4 public chains alongside Ethereum, EOS and Tron. Since early April, the IOST network has started processing more transactions per day than Ethereum, which makes IOST the third largest network network among its peers,...
