Would you be kind enough to show an example?

[01-Oct-19 05:53 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
./komodo-cli sendtoaddress "Rxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" 125 "" true

[01-Oct-19 05:53 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
So how do I specify what address the coins are sent from?

[01-Oct-19 05:54 PM] gregmcgolf#5997
Is there an additional parameter or script? I am using a Cli-wallet, not a QT wallet.

[01-Oct-19 06:05 PM] gcharang#6833
@gregmcgolf @Oszy accounts are a deprecated feature
to specify the address coins are sent from, use createrawtransaction
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/rawtransactions.html#createrawtransaction>
Note that it is easy to messup and lose coins when using this command. You have to consume all the balance in a utxo and after subtracting fees, send any remaining amount to yourself

z_sendmany can also be used to specify the source address

The github releases page for verus agama doesn't show the CLI versions or their sha. although the links on the website wallet download page seem to point to the github release

raise this question on the verus discord please ,we don't have anything to do with verus github

Hey guys I have been testing a Smart Chain and It seems that new clients cant get synced past a certain block.  Is there any advice on how I can go about troubleshooting this?

[03-Oct-19 12:14 PM] gcharang#6833
@Hooftly whats the blocknumber? are they all using binaries compiled from the same commit?
can you post the parameters that launch the chain?

[03-Oct-19 12:16 PM] Hooftly#1337
Params:
```
./komodod -ac_name=unicornis -ac_supply=315000 -ac_adaptivepow=1 -ac_blocktime=60 -ac_cbmaturity=12 -ac_cc=2019 -ac_ccactivate=1000 -ac_eras=5 -ac_reward=115000000,8800000,4200000,1800000,1250000 -ac_end=525600,1051200,1576800,1680481,19867680 -ac_staked=50 -addnode=34.223.52.215 -addnode=34.223.107.167 -addnode=34.222.194.199
```

Block numbers:
```
 "blocks": 13387,
  "longestchain": 18543,
```

Binaries were compiled by myself and should be all the same commit but this may not be the case.

[03-Oct-19 12:17 PM] Hooftly#1337
Have 2 nodes staking 1 node mining

[03-Oct-19 12:19 PM] Hooftly#1337
New clients cant get past block 13387 just looking for a way to try and troubleshoot as `-printtoconsole` output is unhelpful

[03-Oct-19 12:20 PM] gcharang#6833
you may find some info in the debuglog of nodes that can't sync
```

did you do anything special on the blockchain around that time

[03-Oct-19 12:24 PM] gcharang#6833
like using a specific module?

[03-Oct-19 12:25 PM] Hooftly#1337
I did not

[03-Oct-19 12:26 PM] Hooftly#1337
started it up, got it staked before block 15 (had to wait 12 cause of CB maturity) and let it do its thing.   Tried to connect a few new clients and ran into this

Would killing this node possibly be of help?

[03-Oct-19 12:35 PM] gcharang#6833
@Hooftly don't delete the blockchain data of the various nodes
can you make tar files for the blockchain data on each node and name them as their ips?
@blackjok3r may be interested

[03-Oct-19 12:35 PM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-eras>
```
ac_eras Combined With ac_cbmaturity
When active, ac_eras changes the behavior of coinbase coins (i.e., the coins that are created as a result of mining). ac_eras forces the COINBASE_MATURITY value of coinbase coins to be 100 instead of the normal value of 1. Therefore, coinbase coins become spendable after 100 confirmations.

This COINBASE_MATURITY value can be explicitly changed using the ac_cbmaturity parameter. Changing this COINBASE_MATURITY value to 1 is recommended if a chain uses ac_eras in conjunction with ac_staked.
```

ah shit look at that

`Insufficient funds, no UTXOs found for taddr from address.`

Know how to deal with this off the top of your head?

[07-Oct-19 01:40 AM] Hooftly#1337
there are only coinbase TXs in the wallet

[07-Oct-19 01:41 AM] gcharang#6833
```
When sending coinbase utxos to a z address, change is not allowed. The entire value of the utxo(s) must be consumed. Currently, the maximum number of z address outputs is 54 due to transaction-size limits.

Hello, i have a question. Ive been claiming my KMD in native mode on the Verus  /agama wallet. and usually i would make sure t send it back to my original address. but today i was too hasty and clicked claim without specifying which wallet to send it to, resulting in a new address created. My question is, now do I  need to save the private key of this new address? or should i just manually send all the funds back to my original address?
