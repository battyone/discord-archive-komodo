I see no CHIPS in verus agama version. Can i still send to the same address?

[05-Jun-19 09:47 AM] gcharang#6833
yes can send chips too

[05-Jun-19 09:48 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
When do you guys think the funds will be sent?

this funds claim form gives me kind of KYC vibes

[05-Jun-19 09:48 AM] crumb#2550
i don't really feel comfortable associating my discord identity and all the addresses i have

[05-Jun-19 09:49 AM] justpip#5610
@crumb Know what you  mean. It links a Discord user to the 'account'. And what about those who don't have a Discord account who have lost funds?

[05-Jun-19 09:49 AM] justpip#5610
@crumb 'account' = KMD address

[05-Jun-19 09:50 AM] gcharang#6833
@crumb just create a new discord account and submit the form
its a point of contact thats it

[05-Jun-19 09:50 AM] crumb#2550
ok

[05-Jun-19 09:50 AM] crumb#2550
what a mess

[05-Jun-19 09:51 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang  But couldn't someone just claim an address with a large amount of KMD and say it's theirs? How can you prove it?

[05-Jun-19 09:51 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@DakuS could you please try sending your funds from the web wallet instead ?

[05-Jun-19 09:51 AM] gcharang#6833
they will sign the message to claim

[05-Jun-19 09:52 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang OK. And that would involve our seed/password of our existing Agama wallet?

[05-Jun-19 09:52 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[05-Jun-19 09:52 AM] KayNut#7485
sorry for double posting: Hi, I'm at work and won't be able to move fonds until later tonight. Question: are fonds from native Agama also at risk?

[05-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@KayNut native modes are not affected. until you used the WIF from native mode to login into Lite mode
so if you havent exported/imported your native WIF keys from/into agama you should be fine

[05-Jun-19 09:53 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Seeing as I can't create a new wallet (see messages above). Sigh. Couldn't we just wait for the fix and then have the funds transferred back to old wallet?

[05-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
old wallet seed is probably compromised @justpip so new wallet needs to be generated

[05-Jun-19 09:54 AM] justpip#5610
@Cryptoon Thanks Cryptoon.

[05-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Warkid#2117
I bet, more than 50% of the fast growing wallet with over 7,4 Mio. will not be claimed ever

[05-Jun-19 09:55 AM] Lokom#2178
Hi my wallet i

[05-Jun-19 09:55 AM] KayNut#7485
@Cryptoon  I haven't. Thanks for the quick help.

[05-Jun-19 09:55 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@KayNut as this point we have to assume that if you access your funds with Agama by inputting your seeds / WIF , then it's not safe

[05-Jun-19 09:55 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Sorry. Me again. I'm just not gettting it. How can I confirm these are my funds on the form because you won't have a copy of my seed/PIN?

[05-Jun-19 09:55 AM] KayNut#7485
@PHBA2061 Thx.

[05-Jun-19 09:57 AM] tastyparrot#0079
when filling int the form to claim do i put in the  amount (small 1.7 or the larger fee amount?

[05-Jun-19 09:59 AM] gcharang#6833
you can cryptographically sign any message using your seed to prove past ownership of that address @justpip just wait and we will publish detailed instructions for the claim process

ðŸ‘Œ 

[05-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Warkid#2117
What if I am right and more than the half of 7,4 million KMD will never be claimed, what happens to this? Will it be burned or used for a good use?

[05-Jun-19 10:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@tastyparrot please enter the details of all the funds you wish to claim

[05-Jun-19 10:02 AM] PHBA2061#2530
technically the attacker could sign the message as well if he had the seeds, but may be it's not worth the effort ?

[05-Jun-19 10:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@Warkid these are funds from users who used their KMD in the past 5 months not people who bought at ico and forgot about them
so I think most will be claimed

[05-Jun-19 10:05 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Thanks for clarifying and for your help this morning. Think my blood pressure is sufficiently lowered. Will head to support to find out why I keep  getting an erroneous'non  alphanumeric' error message when attempting to set up a new wallet (Verus version of Agama) with an alphanumeric seed.

[05-Jun-19 10:05 AM] gcharang#6833
@justpip  let me try logging intio VErus, will inform you if it worked for me

[05-Jun-19 10:20 AM] DakuS#8750
@PHBA2061 This is my first mobile wallet. I have always used desktop wallet before this. I don't even  know if I can access my agama wallet through web too.

[05-Jun-19 10:20 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Seems I may have been trying on the old Agama. Have now created wallet but couldn't connect to server. Manually changed server in settings but that says that server is also unreachable.

[05-Jun-19 10:21 AM] gcharang#6833
you have to activate VRSC not KMD in verus agama

[05-Jun-19 10:21 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@DakuS do you have the seeds ? just import it into the web wallet then sending your funds out from it

[05-Jun-19 10:21 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Oh. Geez. This is getting complicated...

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] DakuS#8750
@PHBA2061 okay. I have the seeds. Can you please provide the link to web wallet please?

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] dsalinas79#8160
Is RJ account safe enough? I have created on VRSC agama

[05-Jun-19 10:22 AM] hastrup#8742
i have transfer all my funds over to verus wallet. how do i transfer them out again? just use my seed on komodo agama wallet?

@hastrup you will be able to access your KMD stored in Verus agama in the coming days either in that wallet itself or in a different wallet
just don't use the seed in komodo agama wallet now

[05-Jun-19 10:23 AM] DakuS#8750
@PHBA2061 Thanks

[05-Jun-19 10:23 AM] hastrup#8742
@hastrup THX!

[05-Jun-19 10:28 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Thanks again. Have activated VRSC but is this the address I should give to send lost KMD? Do they share the same address? Confused ðŸ˜•

[05-Jun-19 10:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@justpip yes
give that address of VRSC (starts with R) as your KMD reclaim address

[05-Jun-19 10:30 AM] gcharang#6833
the seed will be able to access the same address on all the different KMD ecosystem chains

[05-Jun-19 10:30 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Thanks that's what I thought (like Ethereum address can store different ERC-20 tokens) but just wanted to check.

[05-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Lennart#9331
hello i have a question: did KMD team also move other coins like DEX or VRSC?

[05-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Lennart#9331
mine are gone ðŸ˜”

[05-Jun-19 10:32 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Thanks again. Just one final thing (I obviously need more coffee). So the KMD wallet in the new Verus Wallet is simply just not working at the mo?

[05-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Nika.gavvafa#8034
Agama will be supported in Google store?

[05-Jun-19 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
no

[05-Jun-19 10:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@justpip yes. they didn't update code to use the latest KMD electrum servers
otherwise it used to work till a week ago

[05-Jun-19 10:34 AM] DakuS#8750
@PHBA2061 Thanks. It worked.

@gcharang so even though it doesn't connect we can still use the newly created adr on verus wallet  for the google fund form ?

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] justpip#5610
@gcharang Got it! Many thanks again for your help!!!

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] nonapa#2231
hi all

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] nonapa#2231
I think I've got my kmd stollen

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
So to be clear?

1. Download VRSC Agama.
2. Create new wallet seed. Copy it/ write it down.
3. Activate VRSC coin and login to VRSC Agama wallet.
4. Let it sync.
5. Copy receive address.

At this point, do I use my *old* agama wallet to log in using my *old*/unsafe seed and access my coins, then SEND them to the new VRSC wallet receive address?

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bastol yes

[05-Jun-19 10:35 AM] nonapa#2231
I used the latest agama wallet yesterday

[05-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Bastol#5205
thanks

[05-Jun-19 10:36 AM] nonapa#2231
and now I see it has 0 balance

[05-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
Ok thank you.

[05-Jun-19 10:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@Chief Crypto 
no need to sync
with seed you are using lite mode

[05-Jun-19 10:36 AM] nonapa#2231

[05-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Bastol#5205
@gcharang so I'm guessing verus agama version doesn't use the security flawed library

[05-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
How do we change SPV server if we get the SPV error?

[05-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
Only 1 address in the list

@gcharang  also the DEX and VRSC?

[05-Jun-19 10:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@Chief Crypto start VRSC in verus wallet not KMD

[05-Jun-19 10:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@Lennart yes move them all into a newly created address in verus wallet

[05-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
Sorry, to be clear l, I am getting the error in my OLD Agama wallet, which I am logged in to in order to send my KMD to the VSRC wallet

when i view my public adress in dexstats.info it says "balance 0" at both DEX and VRSC

[05-Jun-19 10:43 AM] Lennart#9331
ZILLA are still there

[05-Jun-19 10:43 AM] gcharang#6833
@Lennart go to their explorers and see which address they have been moved to
