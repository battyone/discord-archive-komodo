My friend I already tried it

[07-Jul-18 09:47 PM] Hermes#6934
You are using Windows or which OS?

[07-Jul-18 09:47 PM] SRG#0675
Win10

[07-Jul-18 09:49 PM] Hermes#6934
What I will do is saving my wallet.dat file an then erase the whole Komodo folder , if that doesn't help it's beyond me , will have to do some testing ... I also have Windows 10 and can test it later

[07-Jul-18 09:49 PM] SRG#0675
I always keep a back up of wallet. Dat

[07-Jul-18 09:51 PM] SHossain#0007
@SRG are you using the 4th july release from here https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/windows/ ?

[07-Jul-18 09:51 PM] SRG#0675

[07-Jul-18 09:52 PM] SRG#0675

[07-Jul-18 09:53 PM] SHossain#0007
3 days ago, should't be having issues with full sync. if you are using old version, you will have issues.

[07-Jul-18 09:54 PM] SRG#0675
Previously I was using old version then I updated to new

[07-Jul-18 09:54 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain hey mate, I sent you a message about an issue I had with Agama wallet a while back that PTYX was helping me with and he mentioned you might be able to help with it now

[07-Jul-18 10:58 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the issue @SquidfaceKillah ?

[07-Jul-18 10:59 PM] SHossain#0007
did you create any support ticket?

[07-Jul-18 10:59 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
It was the empty seed bug and just about getting reimbursed for it, was wondering how that might be coming along

[07-Jul-18 10:59 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
I did, Iâ€™ll have to find it

[07-Jul-18 11:00 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
7713

[07-Jul-18 11:03 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks. i'll have a look and try to get this sorted as soon as we can.

[07-Jul-18 11:08 PM] SHossain#0007
did you send the funds there from your own wallet?

[07-Jul-18 11:32 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
I sent from Binance into what I thought was my own Agama wallet, then within a couple hours it was sent out to another address by someone else

[07-Jul-18 11:33 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
I have my own wallet on Agama all working fine every time I log in, so Iâ€™ve provided that address to PTYX but let me know if you need it again

[07-Jul-18 11:37 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks. i have the address

[07-Jul-18 11:38 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
Thanks mate

[slack] <kso> Hi @jl777c we are trying to do a Komodo dICO for our startup company ForestCoins. May I please ask further questions:

1. Once we set up the Komodo assetchain, do we then split up the premine coins between amongst our nodes so as to prevent whale buying. Does this mean for the dICO now there will be multiple coin addresses (one for each node) that needs to be given to the public to do their funding in exchange for our coins.

2. Say we have 2 existing nodes with example IP Addresses:
  1.2.3.4
  1.2.3.5
and now we want to add a third node. For the third node for the komodod command do we link to the first VPS only (... are :
  $ komodod .... -addnode=1.2.3.4 ....
or do we link to all nodes like this:
  $ komodod .... -addnode=1.2.3.4 -addnode=1.2.3.5 ....

3. Do we apply officially here (we haven't yet):

i don't see any issue syncing on win10. i have deleted all files except `komodo.conf` & `wallet.dat` from data dir and did a resync using the latest `komodod.exe` from artifacts.
Looks like it went well. No stuck block sync.

[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] SRG#0675
Very fast

[08-Jul-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
yes. mine synced 100%

[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] SRG#0675
U not even took 12 hrs to get 100% synced

[08-Jul-18 11:09 AM] SRG#0675
BTW u can check I post get info details above

[08-Jul-18 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
Komodo takes about 1.5-2 hours to sync using high speed internet and good hardware.

[08-Jul-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
from your getinfo, the actual notarizedtxid and notarizedhash is not present

[08-Jul-18 11:16 AM] SRG#0675

[09-Jul-18 12:45 AM] axo777#1232
Any work around for this?

[09-Jul-18 12:46 AM] Hermes#6934
When you say wonâ€™t let me can you specify what happens ? it doesnâ€™t let you open the program or it doesnâ€™t let you start the installation ? make sure you have the latest version from here www.komodoplatform.com

[09-Jul-18 12:47 AM] axo777#1232
It wont install.  I  downloaded from the website 2 hours ago.

[09-Jul-18 12:49 AM] Hermes#6934
Ok can you please specify in what part of the installation it gets stuck or share a screenshot of the error

[09-Jul-18 12:49 AM] Hermes#6934

I downloaded v41 yesterday on my new MAC Book Pro.  I see in old instruction videos that there are more files to download, at least for the older versions.   Does the new v41 installer have all the needed files or do I need more?

[09-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> It has all the needed files no need to get more

[09-Jul-18 06:40 PM] axo777#1232
Thanx @Gateway.  Another question.   I will be running in Native mode.  What Daemon Param should be selected?

[09-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Hermes#6934
None thatâ€™s the standard

[09-Jul-18 06:56 PM] axo777#1232
OK thanks @Hermes.  It is the one on top after all, but with so many choices one does wonder.

[09-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Hermes#6934
In case you need to verify your balance is being showed correct you can use the rescan param

[11-Jul-18 12:20 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
it just never finds my local wallet

[11-Jul-18 12:20 AM] Hermes#6934
It's located in Appdata right ?

[11-Jul-18 12:20 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
yes

[11-Jul-18 12:20 AM] Hermes#6934
Which version of BArterdex you are using? Also wallet is fully loaded right?  First time running it on native?

[11-Jul-18 12:21 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Wallet fully loaded. Using BarterDEX version 1.1.0-rc
