Whomever provisioned the explorer probably has a variable set incorrectly

[30-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Donnie Gebert#8702
This is the relevant place to make that known, yes?

[30-Nov-18 09:27 PM] SHossain#0007

[30-Nov-18 09:30 PM] SHossain#0007
what chain you are running?

[30-Nov-18 09:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its basically TYSLIN

[30-Nov-18 09:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
we have basically two staking nodes

[30-Nov-18 09:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so this is the second one

[30-Nov-18 09:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[30-Nov-18 09:31 PM] SHossain#0007
what exact command did you use to stop the daemon?

[30-Nov-18 09:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TYSLIN stop

[30-Nov-18 09:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
this

[30-Nov-18 09:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now i am only left with wallet.123143.bak

[30-Nov-18 09:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
you didn't backup wallet.dat file?

[30-Nov-18 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
or private keys?

[30-Nov-18 09:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nope üò¶

[30-Nov-18 09:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i think i have lost it

[30-Nov-18 09:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
üò¶

[30-Nov-18 09:33 PM] SHossain#0007
is TYSLIN a test chain?

[30-Nov-18 09:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes it is a test chain

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
then, start another test chain and make sure to backup your wallet.dat file or backup privkeys

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh no üò¶

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
or just simply delete the chain data and start again

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes by deleting the TYSLIN folder right?

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Nov-18 09:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai thanks so nothing can be done in case of recovery ?

[30-Nov-18 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
if only 2 nodes of the whole network, delete data dir from both and start again

[30-Nov-18 09:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[30-Nov-18 09:35 PM] SHossain#0007
it will start from the beginning

[30-Nov-18 09:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[30-Nov-18 09:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no worries

[01-Dec-18 01:46 AM] Ghost#8941

[01-Dec-18 02:46 AM] Ghost#8941
Just download? Do I have to save anything?

[01-Dec-18 02:46 AM] Ghost#8941
I have my password and seed. I'm using lite. No wallet.dat for that right?

[01-Dec-18 02:51 AM] Hermes#6934
The update of the wallet  doesn‚Äôt affect the user data  and if you are using lite mode you won‚Äôt need to save the wallet.dat

[01-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Ghost#8941
Perfect thanks.

[01-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Hermes#6934
Even if you are using native mode updating the wallet won‚Äôt touch the userdata located in the %appdata% path ... it won‚Äôt touch the files contained in Komodo

[01-Dec-18 02:53 AM] Hermes#6934
Let us know if you need any other help üòÉ

[01-Dec-18 02:54 AM] Ghost#8941
Ok thanks. That's all I had in there or I'd tip u more, lol. Thanks again.

When trying to login to HyperDEX. I keep getting an error message stating "cannot connect to marketmaker" Is their something else that I need to download besides the .exe file?

[01-Dec-18 04:00 PM] Nabob#5004
nothing, please stop hyperdex, and make sure you have no instance running with marketmaker

[01-Dec-18 07:23 PM] Torankoku#4818
you guys need to make this far less complicated than this needs to be with the whole mobile wallet and native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:28 PM] SHossain#0007
mobile wallet doen'st have native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Torankoku#4818
i know that

[01-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Torankoku#4818
sync between mobile wallet  and native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Torankoku#4818
is awful

[01-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Torankoku#4818
claim reward in native mode, it does not show up in mobile wallet

[01-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Torankoku#4818
send whole funds to yourself and i have three addresses in native mode

[01-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Torankoku#4818
while mobile wallet shows balance for reward

[01-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Torankoku#4818
what is this sillyness?

[01-Dec-18 07:30 PM] SHossain#0007
native mode works differently. it's not sillyness if you understand how native mode works

[01-Dec-18 07:30 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD native mode works same ways as Bitcoin

[01-Dec-18 07:31 PM] SHossain#0007
mobile wallet uses SPV, which works only with single address
