@Kenyre 
check what block you are in. use getinfo
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use getblockhash 1444008
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH> without <> like the command below
once that is done, use reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2

Hey there. My Komodo Ocean wallet seems to be stuck at block 1445931.

[18-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Kaed#8040
I have 16 cnx to the network.

[18-Jul-19 09:39 AM] Kaed#8040
It's a fresh resync using the most recent bootstrap on dexstats.

[18-Jul-19 09:41 AM] gcharang#6833

Hi Team. I have an Agama wallet address that I deposited KMD to a while ago.The address shows funds on  kmdexplorer.io but when I paste my seed words into Agama, a different wallet address comes up showing 0 KMD. Is there a way I can paste a specific wallet address into the Agama wallet?

[19-Jul-19 03:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seed was entered in wrong

@Rave DM me your old address

[20-Jul-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@netfreak We have sent you smartdust (small amount of verification fund) to your compromised address. You have to send that smartdust to the refund address you specified in your claim. This will validate your claim and you will receive refund.

Please check the refund process article here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[20-Jul-19 02:24 PM] knijia#0971
Hi @SHossain , about the refund, i filled the form Thursday with this discord nickname, but if i understand, i must send 0.0001 KMD to my new address to complete the verification but my balance on the compromised address is only of 0.0001 and i can't send it because the fees are also of 0.0001. What can i do ? Thanks.

On June 5, my KMD tokens were stolen from the Agama Wallet wallet and on July 13th I filled in the claim form and made the small transfer to the new address in another wallet. I have not received the tokens in the nine address yet. Please, can you inform me of this situation, Thank you

[20-Jul-19 06:42 PM] SHossain#0007

Should refund after 4ish hours

[22-Jul-19 11:40 AM] knijia#0971
Hi, i made an invalid claim last saturday. After verifications, i remembered that i created a new address from the recommendations here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement right after i read an article about the problem. I installed Agama-Windows-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview, created a new seed, PIN and password, i then moved 159 KMD to the new address (RRFgArgcHaBFwKqYFdh1hifuUvGjCQPBJo). I'm sure i did it right, but now when i enter the seed, the address it gaves me is RErMuJnN3Ccphj5366tyPPHR4x7XXnoJg2 and i can't find the 159 KMD i had (it seems to be on the RRFgArgcHaBFwKqYFdh1hifuUvGjCQPBJo on which it seems i have no control over it) . I'm a bit lost, does someone has any idea of what is happening to me ? Thanks.

[22-Jul-19 11:44 AM] gcharang#6833
@knijia
input the seed without extra spaces.
 https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027661-why-am-i-not-seeing-the-same-address-when-i-login-

if you had given the wallet a name and setup a password, you can use the password to login

[22-Jul-19 11:59 AM] knijia#0971
@gcharang Thanks for your answer. It's accurate that if i had an extra space, it gaves me another address, but it's seems not to be the address it was first given to me (the address i sent 159 KMD : RRFgArgcHaBFwKqYFdh1hifuUvGjCQPBJo) and it's empty. When creating my new address on june 6th, i indeed fill in a custom pin filename and a password i set up. When logging with these credentials, the KMD address is RErMuJnN3Ccphj5366tyPPHR4x7XXnoJg2 which is not the one it was first given to me.

[22-Jul-19 12:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@knijia  when you are logging in using walletname + password, you did leave the "wallet seed/wif" field empty, correct?

[22-Jul-19 12:08 PM] knijia#0971
@gcharang yes, only custom PIN (already displayed) and the password.

[22-Jul-19 12:20 PM] knijia#0971
what is sure is that i then sent my KMD to that address created in lite mode (address that was given to me with custom pin, password and seed) but it's not the address it gaves me now. I really don't understand how it's possible.

[22-Jul-19 12:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@knijia I am not sure what else could be wrong 

may be try adding extra spaces either before the first word or after the last word
or in both places

and see if the other address is created

[22-Jul-19 12:44 PM] knijia#0971
@gcharang yes i must admit that i don't understand where i made a mistake, i followed the steps with attention and checked if the transfer of the 159KMD arrived and i saw in the wallet that the KMD had arrived and then i closed everything reassured. It's only a few days ago when i reopened it that i saw it empty. That's why i first thought of the sweep.

[22-Jul-19 06:27 PM] knijia#0971
i tried everything possible but i guess it's lost forever. It's weird to see the coins and not being able to access it üò™

[23-Jul-19 04:23 AM] sspdis#0896
I was using a key and agama wallet  since a long time, it works fine

[23-Jul-19 04:23 AM] sspdis#0896
Untill the recent issue surfaced

[23-Jul-19 04:23 AM] sspdis#0896
I was even able to fetch the address by using the old key in agama versus wallet

[23-Jul-19 04:23 AM] sspdis#0896
A month ago

[23-Jul-19 04:24 AM] sspdis#0896
But now, when i give the same key, it takes me to a new key.. i couldn't see any KMD thr

[23-Jul-19 04:25 AM] gcharang#6833
if you have the old wallet installed, you can export the wif: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password
and use it in the place of seed to login

@BigLouis1971 who should be sending you these coins?

[23-Jul-19 04:30 AM] sspdis#0896
I think the issue is, when i copy from xls cell, it gives me a new address, when i copied text, it landed on right address

[23-Jul-19 04:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@sspdis yes, please backup in a text file
files with other formats might add extra characters to the words which will change the seed

[23-Jul-19 04:32 AM] sspdis#0896
Will do that

[23-Jul-19 04:33 AM] sspdis#0896
But isn't it a bit scary that without PIN or pass and just by providing a key, we can access the wallet

[23-Jul-19 04:33 AM] sspdis#0896
If i go on typing random keys,, and if any wallet has any kmd, wi transfer that

[23-Jul-19 04:33 AM] sspdis#0896

I agree , it is impossible to guess a person's key.. but the way i gave a bad char and got an wallet address, the same way of i land on a wallet having some kmd, i may misuse

[23-Jul-19 04:38 AM] sspdis#0896
If the random address has some kmd, i may transfer that without any pin or pass or 2F auth

whenever you change a character in your passphrase a new address is generated by you.

i believe you can add a pin to the wallet if it helps. I was freaked out by the same phenomenon myself before.

Unlock in Ocean. Agama doesn‚Äôt support this.

[23-Jul-19 02:53 PM] Spaid#3606
the reason I am using agama is because I can't get Ocean to sync

Does Agama sync?

[23-Jul-19 02:54 PM] Spaid#3606
I can open Ocean and maybe unencrypt?  yes, Agama (Veruscoin) syncs

[23-Jul-19 02:55 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Then ocean should be synced too. All wallet programs use the same data folders on your drive.
