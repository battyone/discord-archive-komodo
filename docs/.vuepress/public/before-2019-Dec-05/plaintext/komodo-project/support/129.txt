Hello friends

[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] aka222#2811
What's the update the agama

[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] aka222#2811
When will be the update one?

[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] aka222#2811
With fix

[07-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Louis#8450
@gcharang - Sorry, was transferring Pirate Coin too, and got confused

[07-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Louis#8450
If your store KMD on Ledger Nano, is that ok?

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis pirate coins are most likely not compromiseed, but I recommend you create a new wallet.dat for it and transfer from old address  to new address from it 
ask for help in the Pirate discord on how to do this

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis ledger is ok
make sure you haven't input the ledger seed in old Agama

[07-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Louis#8450
Ok will do - is it ok to check balances on the ledger  Magnum Wallet, as check the balance yesterday for KMD using it?

[07-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Louis#8450
Thanks

[07-Jun-19 02:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis 
>  is it ok to check balances on the ledger  Magnum Wallet,

How it is possible that kmd founder able to move other peoples coins??

[07-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Dom001#1832
logged in with my old seed in the new agama v0.5.6a in VRSC, when i activate kmd, and then got an error:

Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server...

I go into the settings then under SPV servers list and select there one comes out:

Wallet Notification
KMD SPV server electrum1.cipig.net:10001:tcp is unreachable!

Wallet Notification
KMD SPV server electrum2.cipig.net:10001:tcp is unreachable!

i hope my VRSC generated address is compatible with kmd, i filled it into the recover form...

[07-Jun-19 02:42 PM] alen#3721
@mazyar_lp they used the bug in agama wallet, just like a hacker could do it..but they moved them to safe wallet, before bad guys

[07-Jun-19 02:43 PM] alen#3721
Thats how i understood it

[07-Jun-19 02:47 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@alen does agama saves all claimed addresses wif or seeds or private keys?? Its annoying to know this. What about decentralisation

[07-Jun-19 02:49 PM] AGL#8368
Luddite here. My agama wallet probably hasn't synced in a year and wondering what the best course of action is. Download new wallet and drag/drop some seed file I assume is in a standard location. Apologies and thanks - A

[07-Jun-19 02:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@AGL you access your wallet using seed?

[07-Jun-19 02:51 PM] AGL#8368
Honestly not sure. Should have the data stored somewhere, but don't have access to that comp at the moment..

[07-Jun-19 02:52 PM] gcharang#6833
you just open agama and the balance is there or you input 24 words?

[07-Jun-19 02:53 PM] AGL#8368
just open...

[07-Jun-19 02:53 PM] AGL#8368
But it became disconnected months ago and I have not viewed it since

[07-Jun-19 02:56 PM] AGL#8368
So when i find my 24 words and plug those into a new wallet I'll be able to see if my funds are safe?

[07-Jun-19 02:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@AGL yes
don't use the old Agama

everyone PLEASE READ: users who had assetchain funds swept to the safe address and used a refund address from an exchange since day 1, please DM me with the exact following details: 
```
- The ID you provided on the claim form
- The exchange address you used for your assetchain funds
- The new address that you want to receive your funds to (you must own the private key of this address)
```
Users who ONLY requested a KMD & BTC payout and provided an exchange address don't  DM me for changes.

[07-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Steelrat#2421
And if I filled out the Form allready on day 1?

[07-Jun-19 05:57 PM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain 
Hello, i would like to know
why are some kmd gone and some stayed on agama? why are some kmd gone and some stayed on agama. that is very odd

[07-Jun-19 06:09 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have any funds left at your old address, please move them to your safe address. please read the guide here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

[07-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jossjana#7067
Yes, i have some kmd on your safe adress, that you have take out of my adress. And the other kmd in my other wallet, i have save on new wallet. But i dont understand why do you took out my kmd to your safe adress.

[07-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Pwnz#4150
so only for people using "exchange" address @SHossain  ?

[07-Jun-19 06:14 PM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[07-Jun-19 06:15 PM] angrygnat#7242
is it safe to enter in the old address with the new version of agama?

[07-Jun-19 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pwnz Please read my post. you shouldn't use exchange address for any other coin except KMD & BTC

[07-Jun-19 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
@angrygnat if you want to move away funds to safety, yes.

[07-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Pwnz#4150
@SHossain i didn't i'm asking if everyone should DM or only ones that used exchange address in claim üòÉ

[07-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Pwnz#4150
thank you and sorry if there's any misunderstanding man

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Pwnz#4150

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] angrygnat#7242
no, you did it for me, but to receive back my founds i have to use the old address to send an amount on the new one, or not?

[07-Jun-19 06:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Pwnz you're ok as you have the seed from that

[07-Jun-19 06:21 PM] mrlynch#5735

[07-Jun-19 06:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@jossjana 
if your amount is less than 7777 KMD
it should be by june 15, it could also be sooner

[07-Jun-19 06:27 PM] CryptoJake#9024
@gcharang any potential eta on return?

[07-Jun-19 06:27 PM] jossjana#7067
@gcharang
Ok thanks

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] CryptoJake#9024
i received an extremely small amount of KMD to my agama wallet. not sure if what was from staking or if we are to use this for address verification

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] CryptoJake#9024
will leave there just in case

@gcharang already did and followed the instructions. I believe it did not provide a date, was just curious

[07-Jun-19 06:30 PM] CryptoJake#9024
thank you sir

[07-Jun-19 06:31 PM] CryptoJake#9024
guess i was right about it being a verification. i will send it to my new address asap

[07-Jun-19 06:32 PM] CryptoJake#9024
thank you for the extreme effort taken here. it is certainly a nuisance but it is FAR better than losing the coins

@jossjana send to your new address

[07-Jun-19 06:39 PM] crachel723#7547
is there a way to know if your funds were sent to the safe address? As of now I have a zero balance. But how do we check if our funds were swept?

[07-Jun-19 06:39 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang yes, I sent it to my Coinomi wallet which was the address submitted in the form

[07-Jun-19 06:40 PM] CryptoJake#9024
