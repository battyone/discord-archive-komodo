try putting the file in an external folder outside of src

[05-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Hermes#6934
put in Downloads , then type cd Downloads in terminal and execute the installation with

[05-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Hermes#6934
sudo ./Agama ....

[05-Sep-18 12:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
same rsult

[05-Sep-18 12:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
result

[05-Sep-18 12:10 AM] Hermes#6934
sudo ./AgamaApp-0.2.41d-beta-linux-installer.run

[05-Sep-18 12:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, I did that

[05-Sep-18 12:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
returns

[05-Sep-18 12:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
sudo: unable to execute ./AgamaApp.[...].run: No such file or directory"
```

[05-Sep-18 12:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is it possible that deleting the folder caused this?

[05-Sep-18 12:12 AM] Hermes#6934
it shouldn't affect it because it should also work in a fresh installation.

[05-Sep-18 12:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
well, what do you suggest now?

[05-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Hermes#6934
reviewing this , which Ubuntu version you are running ? 18.04?

[05-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That one is... Kubuntu, which I think is 17.10...

[05-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can check, hang on.

[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's 18.04

[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Hermes#6934
I just did a fresh install in 16.04 have never installed agama and with 41d is giving me the uninstall option , ok let me try this on a server and I will get back to you shortly

[05-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Hermes#6934
so the setup never launched previously and the version that you had before was 2.41d?

[05-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It was having issues loading before all of this.

[05-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When I started up Agama, I would get a "can't connect RPC something"

[05-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I forget what the error was.

[05-Sep-18 12:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll be back tomorrow.

[05-Sep-18 12:18 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm out of time for now. Thank you.

[05-Sep-18 12:20 AM] Hermes#6934
ok will let you know how it goes from here , I think is related to the path will confirm you later.

[05-Sep-18 12:40 AM] jspook16#3059
Anyone know why CHIPS isnt listed in the dexstats Address Asset Viewer?

[05-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Nabob#5004
chips not an komodo asset, if you want to check details use atomicexplorer.com

[05-Sep-18 01:04 AM] jspook16#3059
I never realized that. I went to the github and confirmed....tis true. Thanks @Nabob

[05-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Hermes#6934
@Bryan_Beus  Install this dependency on Ubuntu 18.04 you still need to have it to run sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4 libcurl3

[05-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Hermes#6934
I faced the same issue while doing the installation as sudo...that should solve it

[05-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, will try tomorrow. Thank you.

[05-Sep-18 07:50 AM] eclips#1570
hi

[05-Sep-18 07:50 AM] eclips#1570
playing with api on various komodo explorer

[05-Sep-18 07:51 AM] eclips#1570
i want to get all historic of fund received

[05-Sep-18 07:51 AM] eclips#1570
using api

[05-Sep-18 07:51 AM] eclips#1570
https://explorer.komodo.services/api/txs/?address=RLjJ8upp93NjeMVbhjVHCXiFVrq8zWo3GT

[05-Sep-18 07:51 AM] eclips#1570
but i get 1 month of historical data

[05-Sep-18 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @eclips 
There is a `pagesTotal":12` returning in JSON

[05-Sep-18 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
To fetch first page you have to call like a `https://explorer.komodo.services/api/txs/?address=RLjJ8upp93NjeMVbhjVHCXiFVrq8zWo3GT&pageNum=0`

[05-Sep-18 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Second page `&pageNum=1` and etc

[05-Sep-18 08:02 AM] eclips#1570
meaning i only get the first page by default ?

[05-Sep-18 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
There is page length set in transactions.js on explorer sourcecode side. So it's dividing return on pages depends of value of `var pageLength = <amountoftxs> ` And by default you get only first page.

[05-Sep-18 08:06 AM] eclips#1570
ok

[05-Sep-18 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
So you have to implement some for loop to go through all the pages

[05-Sep-18 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess

[05-Sep-18 08:06 AM] eclips#1570
that was my next question

[05-Sep-18 08:07 AM] eclips#1570
trying to import all the data into google sheet with =ImportJSON("https://explorer.komodo.services/api/txs/?address=RLjJ8upp93NjeMVbhjVHCXiFVrq8zWo3GT","","noInherit,noTruncate")

[05-Sep-18 08:07 AM] eclips#1570
so now way to have it all with 1 URL ?

[05-Sep-18 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Change `var pageLength =` in the explorer sourcecode only way to have it all with 1 URL I think

[05-Sep-18 08:08 AM] eclips#1570
guess i'll have to do some scripting

[05-Sep-18 08:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Otherwise you have to execute and append to your JSON: https://explorer.komodo.services/api/txs/?address=RLjJ8upp93NjeMVbhjVHCXiFVrq8zWo3GT&pageNum=<I> for each page from 0 to pagesTotal-1

[05-Sep-18 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
And then send this JSON where you need

[05-Sep-18 06:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes That solved the issue on the laptop. Thank you.

[05-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Hermes#6934
nice to hear that

[05-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Hermes#6934
Will be updating the guides in the support desk for this to be more seen on top

[05-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You suggested I delete a file, but I can't remember which one it was.

[05-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
.conf or .ini or something

[05-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
maybe komodo.conf

[05-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Hermes#6934
for the unable to establish RPC issue?

[05-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Hermes#6934
you can delete komodo.conf

[05-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Hermes#6934
the chainstate and the blocks

[05-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Hermes#6934
inside the Komodo folder

[05-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
No, in Agama, allthough the blocks will sync correctly, the Agama app itself is untouchable. 

Any attempt to click on a button procures a "failed to get dashboard" error

[05-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Hermes#6934
thats happening only in one of your laptops?

[05-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
only one of my machines, a 17.10 Ubuntu installation.

[05-Sep-18 10:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
that's my main desktop

[05-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes on another laptop, the sync time for KMD is intolerably low for some reason.

[05-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've left it going for I think two days now, and it's only 29% of the way done.

[05-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I thought I had already synced this computer, too, so I don't know what triggered the rescan.

[05-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
err, resync

[05-Sep-18 11:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes I tried deleting the komodo.conf file, made a new one (empty), and restarted the chain.

When I start Agama now, the synchronization process freezes at 100%.

[05-Sep-18 11:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The error from earlier, "desktop update failed", hasn't fired, yet.

[05-Sep-18 11:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Nevermind, the error is back.

[05-Sep-18 11:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
"getDashboardUpdate" error or something.

[05-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Hermes#6934
I am testing this any on native mode will check with you shortly 18.04 right?

[05-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Hermes#6934
the other laptop that's syncing can be experiencing the slow download time because of resources maybe two days is too much

[06-Sep-18 08:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, is a wallet created using `getnewaddress` on an assetchain (ie. komodo-cli  -ac_name=STAKED4) the same as wallet created running `komodod`?
I'm wondering specifically if the `pubkey` is the same?

[06-Sep-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
privkey/pubkey pairs are always the same. whether it is in any specific wallet depends only on whether it is in that wallet

[06-Sep-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
a wallet is basically a collection of privkeys

[06-Sep-18 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, I see.  That makes sense.  üí° 
I created the  privkey/pubkey pair on the STAKED4 assetchain.  I'd like to use the pubkey for a notarynode for STAKED.  Is that OK or should I make a new pair while using komodod on the KMD chain?

[06-Sep-18 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
why would it matter either way?

[06-Sep-18 09:04 AM] CrisF#3405
That's the part I wasn't clear on  Thank you!

Sir Samuel: ‚ÄûWhat are the benefits of running a full node?‚Äú

[06-Sep-18 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
@Seko Blockchain is storing on your PC with all the pros and cons of it. Usually it's about needed ways of software using/ needed features  + needed level of trust to blockchain and/or redundancy control. If I understood this question correct

[06-Sep-18 10:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Hermes On (yet another) laptop, where I already have 2.41d properly installed, I had a resync triggered for no reason a few days ago. 

I think it's been about three days now, and the blockchain is only 37% synced.

Any ideas on how to speed this up?

[06-Sep-18 10:38 PM] Hermes#6934
Please post here the PC specs and the version of the OS,

[06-Sep-18 10:39 PM] Hermes#6934
if you can also post the task manager window to see how much CPU Komodod is using

[06-Sep-18 10:39 PM] Hermes#6934
will be good to know where the limitation could be

[06-Sep-18 10:39 PM] Hermes#6934
Are you using HDD or SSD ? and your ram currently

[06-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
SSD
ubuntu 17.10
CPU Intel i7

[06-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Mem 16GB

[06-Sep-18 11:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
While you're looking at those things for the laptop, I'm having more issues pop up on my desktop (custom built). 
CLI is not working anymore. I've been using CLI to avoid Agama's issues with the dashboard.
Getting this error repeatedly in the terminal:
```
HaveInputs missing input 79020861889860979ce4d3b18de86020690c86cede4c7a8852a852597e369766/v1
```

[06-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The encoded characters change from time to time.

[06-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Hermes#6934
So it freezed at some point it started loading blocks or it just doesn't start synching any blocks?

[06-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It was working fine for hours.

[06-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I had it running in the background and was trying to clean off this pc so I can use it for testing purposes.

Then it started giving this error:

```
error: couldn't connect to server: timeout reached (code 0)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)
```

[06-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's frozen now.

[06-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, it finally quit

[06-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
restarting

[06-Sep-18 11:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think it's working now.

[07-Sep-18 12:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The laptop isn't, though.
