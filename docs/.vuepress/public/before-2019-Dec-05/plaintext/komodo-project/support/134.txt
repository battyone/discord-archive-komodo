Question about the hack reclaim process: A small amount of KMD has been sent into compromised addresses and the rightful owners are to access the compromised address and send the small amount to their new destination address.  My question is this:  There is a tx fee, so are users to send the small amount minus the tx fee?  Is that sufficient?

[08-Jun-19 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, sufficient amount for 1 tx was sent out

[08-Jun-19 05:44 PM] gcharang#6833
@jspook16 the wallet has some problems with chips
best is to: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029965-moving-chips-to-a-new-address

[08-Jun-19 05:46 PM] jspook16#3059
thank you @gcharang

[08-Jun-19 05:47 PM] jspook16#3059
One more question, how do i activate chips 3? I only see a "CHIPS" option in Verus Agama

[08-Jun-19 06:02 PM] jspook16#3059
disregard.... the steps in the link had the step number for "3." in the line for step 2. I just realized that

[08-Jun-19 06:55 PM] bushtea#4656
After submitting the form, what is the next step in the process? Do I have to do anything?

[08-Jun-19 06:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@bushtea 
After submitting the form, please read this document carefully to understand the refund process. https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident
Summary: We have sent a small amount of KMD to your compromised address as confirmation that we have moved those funds. Send 0.0001 KMD from the compromised address to the New address you have submitted in the form to prove ownership.

1) login using compromised seed

[08-Jun-19 06:56 PM] bushtea#4656
thank you

[08-Jun-19 07:13 PM] mcgs#0798
@gcharang  I sent the whole amount in the transaction.  It was like .00123456 that I received, then I just sent that same amount to the new address.  Elsewhere in a different document it doesn't say to send exactly 0.0001 KMD, it said to just send 'the small amount'.  Is this a problem?  Or is it enough to have successfully sent a small tx?

[08-Jun-19 07:14 PM] gcharang#6833
@mcgs that is fine

[08-Jun-19 07:22 PM] yanomi#1722
I have 0.00020509 still in the old compromised address, this was before i sent the form in. Do i need to wait for the 0.0001 KMD from you guys?

[08-Jun-19 07:26 PM] gcharang#6833
no @yanomi just send it to the new address you submitted

[08-Jun-19 07:30 PM] yanomi#1722
@gcharang ok thanks

[08-Jun-19 07:51 PM] orange sunshine#8588

For Lite mode users:
https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview download that
it is safe
first create a new wallet (new seed)
note down the address
then import the old seed (compromised), send all funds to the new address
if "electrum error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-server

Create a new seed/address then send from old one to new one as per directions above.

[08-Jun-19 08:01 PM] yorklab#7270
Then delete your old Agama.

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] LB#7583
I can't send from the old one, as I can't get into it.

[08-Jun-19 08:03 PM] yorklab#7270
Use the Verus Wallet and input your seed there.

[08-Jun-19 08:06 PM] LB#7583
OK, looks like a desktop version - no app. Thanks. I think I can sort that out.

How do I " Import compromised WIF key (from step 3) in ChipsQT"?

[08-Jun-19 09:22 PM] farl#9964
@jspook16

[08-Jun-19 09:23 PM] jspook16#3059
If you were able to get the WIF, you just log into the verus 0.5.7 agama with that WIF

[08-Jun-19 09:23 PM] jspook16#3059
I was unable to get it to work for me (I didnt get past exporting the WIF key) @farl

[08-Jun-19 09:24 PM] farl#9964
Verus Agama won't let me transfer CHIPS

[08-Jun-19 09:24 PM] farl#9964
CHIPS gives error Invalid Pub Address.

How do I import the priv key in CHIPS QT. With Debug Console I presume?

[08-Jun-19 09:27 PM] jspook16#3059
Ive never used it so i dont know what it looks like . Is there not an option to enter the WIF when you first launch it?

[08-Jun-19 09:27 PM] farl#9964
nope

[08-Jun-19 09:27 PM] farl#9964
It's like a Bitcoin QT wallet

[08-Jun-19 09:28 PM] jspook16#3059
then i would think youd have to import via the debug console if it has one (like youre thinking)

[08-Jun-19 09:29 PM] farl#9964
I found it on Google. How amazing is that! üòâ

[08-Jun-19 09:30 PM] farl#9964

[08-Jun-19 10:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@Quarterback you need to first submit the form with updated claim address
then send 0.0001 to it from the old address
