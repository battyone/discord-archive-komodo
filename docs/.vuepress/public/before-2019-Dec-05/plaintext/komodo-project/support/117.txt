@javita is it 0,6 version of verus and did you disable proxy?

[05-Jun-19 09:22 PM] crumb#2550
@gcharang  in the claim form there is a address to receive coins back field. can i write there that i'd like to use multiple addresses and give those actual addresses later, when i'm contacted by Komodo team member? at least for me it would make more sense that way

[05-Jun-19 09:22 PM] bouch#7580
I sent the PGT coin, and Amount says NaN - I did see the balance in the new wallet, not worried not a lot and don't know what this coin is.

[05-Jun-19 09:22 PM] javita#1621
No how do I disable proxy

[05-Jun-19 09:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@crumb do that, its fine

[05-Jun-19 09:23 PM] crumb#2550

[05-Jun-19 09:26 PM] davsal#6873
In Verus Agama wallet, is there the ability to claim KMD rewards?  As we do in other Agama wallets?

[05-Jun-19 09:27 PM] jspook16#3059
Yes I see one as we speak

[05-Jun-19 09:35 PM] Nitego#6721
I can't even get into my Agama wallet to check or move funds

[05-Jun-19 09:35 PM] javita#1621
Gcharang, I followed instructions and proxy was already disabled. Nevertheless LSU I followed all the steps and I am still unable to send.

[05-Jun-19 09:36 PM] javita#1621
It says unable to get transaction history data

[05-Jun-19 09:38 PM] mrlynch#5735
are you both trying to send from agama?

@jspook16 thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:39 PM] Nitego#6721
@mrlynch  yes 
@jspook16 should  I be import the seed from the Agama wallet to another wallet before i send it?

[05-Jun-19 09:39 PM] javita#1621
I am trying to send from Agama v03.4 where my funds are to the new versus Agama wallet

[05-Jun-19 09:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Nitego yes

[05-Jun-19 09:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
@javita 
1. create new seed in verus agama - backup seed and copy address
2. logout
3. import old agama seed in verus agama
4. send funds to the newly created safe address
5. logout
6. log back in with safe seed

[05-Jun-19 09:42 PM] QuadraQ#5617
If you're using native mode you wouldn't need to import the old address.

[05-Jun-19 09:43 PM] javita#1621
Oh I did not do step 3. Let me try that. Whew this is confusing. If I do nothing and leave them in the old wallet are they still really at risk?

[05-Jun-19 09:43 PM] javita#1621
I am using SPV lite

[05-Jun-19 09:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you used agama in the last 4+ months consider those seeds compromised

[05-Jun-19 09:45 PM] Nitego#6721
verus agama  is that same as Agama v0.6.0-13

[05-Jun-19 09:45 PM] DLT Novice#2835
I used the webwallet to move all assets to the Venus wallet but now I see in announcements not to use webwallet to send out, why is that?

[05-Jun-19 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Nitego that is the one

[05-Jun-19 09:46 PM] Nitego#6721
thanks

[05-Jun-19 09:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
@DLT Novice if you moved funds you're fine... don't use web wallet to store or move funds anymore

[05-Jun-19 09:46 PM] DLT Novice#2835
Ok thanks,

[05-Jun-19 09:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@DLT Novice if you have already done it, its fine
its the same as using the KMD agama official wallet
now we have alternate solutions that don't need the web wallet

[05-Jun-19 09:47 PM] javita#1621
Mr lynch when you say used do you mean transfer , withdraw, deposit? I have logged in within 4 months just to check funds but have done none of the above

[05-Jun-19 09:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@javita just loggedin is unsafe

I am stuck at importing in old Agama seed into new wallet. What do I do next?

[05-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Yoe#9564
1. create new seed in verus agama - backup seed and copy address
2. logout
3. import old agama seed in verus agama
4. send funds to the newly created safe address
5. logout
6. log back in with safe seed

[05-Jun-19 09:55 PM] javita#1621
Stuck on 3???

[05-Jun-19 09:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
stuck how?

[05-Jun-19 09:56 PM] javita#1621
I know the new seed and the old seed, but where do I import old agama seed into new

[05-Jun-19 09:57 PM] Yoe#9564
With importing basically mean logging in. It just as the old agama you have to log in. From your old seed you can send it to your new addres

[05-Jun-19 09:58 PM] Yoe#9564
Make sure, to log in twice with your new seed. So you know you stored it correctly

[05-Jun-19 09:58 PM] Yoe#9564
Then transfer your coins

[05-Jun-19 09:59 PM] Yoe#9564
Im not a team member of this discord btw

[05-Jun-19 10:01 PM] javita#1621
My head is about to explode. I used my old seed with my new Versus, I got in and there kus 0 balance

[05-Jun-19 10:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@javita search the address in kmdexplorer.io

[05-Jun-19 10:03 PM] blubbi#0643
if coins went to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF ur safu

[05-Jun-19 10:05 PM] javita#1621
The new Versus wallet address shows on kmdexplorer with 0 balance which is right, because I have been unsuccessful in sending from old wallet to it

[05-Jun-19 10:07 PM] gcharang#6833
what does the old wallet address show on explorer? @javita

[05-Jun-19 10:08 PM] javita#1621
It shows my current balance

[05-Jun-19 10:11 PM] gcharang#6833
can we take this to dms? @javita

[05-Jun-19 10:12 PM] javita#1621
Yes please

@gcharang javits direct messaging

[05-Jun-19 10:19 PM] geodragon#6842
Help!!  My original Agama wallet  has been cleaned out.  The addresses the coins went to are not the "safe" addresses you show in your security announcement. When I use Komodo's Address Asset viewer with my address, it shows my coins in two locations, but neither of these addresses are the "safe" addresses.

[05-Jun-19 10:19 PM] geodragon#6842
have I lost my coins?

[05-Jun-19 10:20 PM] wil#2080
Error: Unknown method
Blockchain.address.get_balance
What does it mean?

[05-Jun-19 10:20 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Same question as Geodragon... Have we lost our coins or are there multiple safe addresses supposedly?

[05-Jun-19 10:20 PM] fern#2676
There are other safe addresses

[05-Jun-19 10:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@geodragon dm me your address, I will verify

[05-Jun-19 10:21 PM] fern#2676
they went to other addresses before ending up at the main safe one, so follow the coins and see

[05-Jun-19 10:21 PM] geodragon#6842
sorry for ignorance, but what is dm and how do I use it?

[05-Jun-19 10:21 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Direct message

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Me too gcharang? or can you show us how to verify?

[05-Jun-19 10:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Kobuzzal did you follow the coins to the final destination?

[05-Jun-19 10:23 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Fern, how do we follow the coins? Not sure hyperDEX

[05-Jun-19 10:23 PM] gcharang#6833
dm means direct message
you can check the addresses in kmdexplorer.io

[05-Jun-19 10:23 PM] geodragon#6842
do I click on your name to use dm?

[05-Jun-19 10:24 PM] gcharang#6833
yes

Kobuzzal, Put your address in the explorer and see if you can recognise the final address https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF

[05-Jun-19 10:30 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
fern: I did that, and it appears my funds landed in the address put in the security announcement: RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF . This address has almost 8 million KMD in it. Does this mean our funds are safe? I already filled out the claim form. Thanks for all your help.

[05-Jun-19 10:30 PM] gcharang#6833
@Kobuzzal yes the funds are safe, please wait for an announcement about the claim process

[05-Jun-19 10:30 PM] fern#2676
Yep thats it, should be fine

[05-Jun-19 10:36 PM] fern#2676
Does anyone know whether the latest Komodo Ocean wallet is safe to use?

[05-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Ocean wallet should be safe - Only agama is affected

👌 

[05-Jun-19 10:45 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Others have asked what prevents someone from filling out the existing claim form with publicly available data and stealing refunds, but I didn't see a good answer to the question. Anyone have any input on that?

So at the initial prompting to move coins from agama, I immediately logged in and sent my coins to DP - FML. Are my coins ok because I'm just seeing DP was the target and lost a bunch of KMD, sheesh. thanks for any help

[05-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@ShitcoinWhale 

As a general rule, if in doubt, move your funds to a paper wallet.
