anyone having loading issues with BDEX? 1.1.0 loaded for me. then i updated my coin list, shut down, downloaded 1.1.1 and after putting in seed the window opens but no coins load. there is just a constant spinning circle.

[01-Aug-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Not really did you saw if bdex closed completely on the last shut down

[01-Aug-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Also you can try erasing the Barterdex folder in %appdata%

[01-Aug-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> And retry launching

[01-Aug-18 11:54 PM] c2k#4915
it did close completely. i even checked in task manager for any marketmaker instance and there was none

[01-Aug-18 11:56 PM] c2k#4915
i did get some microsoft window popup tho...asking if i wanted to send them information about marketmaker.

[01-Aug-18 11:57 PM] c2k#4915
and there was a marketmaker popup behind that

[01-Aug-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Ok

[02-Aug-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> I think that erasing the Barterdex folder in %appdata% should help you

[02-Aug-18 12:00 AM] c2k#4915
this is the initial popup message

[02-Aug-18 12:01 AM] c2k#4915
i cant paste a snippet in here for some reason

[02-Aug-18 12:03 AM] c2k#4915
1) im not comfortable doing that
2) when you say "i think" im reluctant to do it even more

[02-Aug-18 12:07 AM] Hermes#6934
Normally if you don't have any stuck swap that's one possible solution

[02-Aug-18 12:08 AM] Hermes#6934
Because erasing the whole Barterdex folder in %appdata% will clear the path for a fresh start or sometimes erasing coins.json file in that same Barterdex folder

[02-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Nabob#5004
which coin when added you get constant spinning? electrum or native

[02-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Nabob#5004

Hi. Want to install barterdex on Arch Linux. Following the instructions, I started with installing komodo from git.

[02-Aug-18 03:39 PM] tkh23#4477
Compiling fails despite having installed all dependencies.

[02-Aug-18 03:40 PM] tkh23#4477
Any help would be greatly appreciated! üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
post the console output

[02-Aug-18 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
which branch you were trying to install? from which repo?

[02-Aug-18 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007
are you planning on using native mode?
if you want to use SPV mode without downloading blockchain data, you don't need to use komodo binaries

I mainly need it to do atomic swaps between BTC/ZEC. ZEC is running in full mode already.

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] tkh23#4477
Will I need to run BTC client?

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] tkh23#4477
I think just the wallet seeds are enough for swaps, right?

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to perform only BTC/ZEC swap, you don't need komodo wallet

[02-Aug-18 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
you need BTC and ZEC wallet

[02-Aug-18 03:45 PM] tkh23#4477

use electrum mode if you don't want to download blockchain data

Okay. Thanks for the fast help brother. I will try that way üòÉ

Can Zcash be added to BarterDEX GUI?

[02-Aug-18 04:24 PM] tkh23#4477
nvm, had to restart after updating coinsdb or enabling experimental features. Not sure which

[02-Aug-18 04:24 PM] tkh23#4477
But it's there now. Disregard

[02-Aug-18 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont think ZEC will work now due to their recently changed new txformat

[02-Aug-18 06:34 PM] 0x03#8822
idiot question, if i send coins to the resulting p2sh address of a `6a` (OP_RETURN) script, are they then locked? how would i come up with the PK for such an address anyways?

[02-Aug-18 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
opreturn coins are burned

[02-Aug-18 06:42 PM] 0x03#8822
ok, so basically bJj83uBV4WXQLqyCdH841bzjW84JwQexnK would be a valid burn address, right?

[02-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
not necessarily

[02-Aug-18 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible for some redeemscript to end up with that address

[02-Aug-18 06:43 PM] 0x03#8822
ok. what if i used `0 1 OP_EQUALVERIFY`

[02-Aug-18 06:44 PM] 0x03#8822
instead of OP_RETURN

[02-Aug-18 06:44 PM] 0x03#8822
and no i dont wanna burn my coins, i'm just trying to understand this üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
to be able to spend the coins, you need to satisfy the spend script

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
for p2sh address, additionally you need to know the redeemscript

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] 0x03#8822
that much i understood. the script hash and the 'data to satisfy the script' so it evals to true

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] 0x03#8822
now... how can 0 == 1 ever be true

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that one cant

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so the coins are effectively burned

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] 0x03#8822
```# komodo-cli decodescript 0100010188
{
  "asm": "0 1 OP_EQUALVERIFY",
  "type": "nonstandard",
  "p2sh": "bKgMfAkubvXjgm5NbMpYPDDWQXBnRX5esK"
}
```

[02-Aug-18 06:46 PM] 0x03#8822
amirite

[02-Aug-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is a p2sh address you wont necessarily know the redeemscript

[02-Aug-18 06:48 PM] 0x03#8822
ic. now how would i come up with that

[02-Aug-18 06:49 PM] 0x03#8822
thats not something thats documented a lot or i'm just completely unable to find the info

[02-Aug-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it is meant to be a secret until the first spend

[02-Aug-18 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can spend to a p2sh address and not let anybody else know what its all about

[02-Aug-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to have the redeemscript somehow, any method

[02-Aug-18 06:51 PM] 0x03#8822
ic. but even if i had the script for the 0 1 OP_EQUALVERIFY it then wouldn't help me a lot. true?

[02-Aug-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case, since it is an unspendable script, it would be difficult to spend

[02-Aug-18 06:52 PM] 0x03#8822
because i could use the address but couldn't send off the coins.

[02-Aug-18 06:52 PM] 0x03#8822
very much appreciated your explanations, thanks a lot.

[02-Aug-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the only way to be able to spend it would be to do a hardfork that creates some special rule to allow spending a 0 1 EQUALVERIFY and likely that wont be too well received

Morning  @Hermes  - have some time today to look at that Zilla native wallet sync issue - seen a few links to new versions of agama in other discord channels - anything worth me testing?

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] erikajane#0375
Hi, I have encountered an error when I was trying to install Agama wallet (Windows version) on my laptop..

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] erikajane#0375
0.2.41 beta version

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] erikajane#0375
It says that that the downloaded compressed (zipped) folder was invalid.

I am having trouble getting BarterDex to show my balance for HODLC even after I've successfully enabled it. I definitely have a HODL balance, and marketmaker has successfully connected to the coin. Anyone else run into this?

HODL & HODLC are different

[03-Aug-18 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have HODLC balance at the same address that barterDEX is using?

[03-Aug-18 12:13 PM] luke#8628
hmm... let me check

[03-Aug-18 12:20 PM] luke#8628
You're absolutely correct, I just wasn't looking at the right address. https://imgur.com/xM72UNA . Thank you! Follow up question... is there a way to tell barterDEX to use this other address instead so that it shows a balance when I run the "balances" command?

[03-Aug-18 12:22 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to use the private key or passphrase or the address you want to use

[03-Aug-18 12:44 PM] luke#8628
oh, I see. there was a gap in my understanding. I needed to first send the coins to the barterDex smart address for HODLC. I can see that value now, thanks!

[03-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Nate#8035
getting a "cannot find module ./lib" error that pops up after I updated to the new 2.41 version of agama wallet. Any suggestions?  @Nabob

@Hermes  I'm on a windows 64 bit system

[03-Aug-18 10:41 PM] Hermes#6934
That could have happened because of a corrupt download file that didn't finish the download

[03-Aug-18 10:41 PM] Hermes#6934
could you try downloading the file again and see if that keeps up

[03-Aug-18 10:41 PM] Hermes#6934
if not let me know

[03-Aug-18 10:42 PM] Nate#8035
I have actually tried that 3 times, uninstalling and reinstalling clean from the komodo wallet site

[03-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hermes#6934
ok do you have any pin files in your Agama lite mode version ?

[03-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Nate#8035
I'm  not quite sure I know what you mean, so I would say no
