[17-Sep-18 12:04 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Problem solved ahd to log out and log In again from wallet.

[17-Sep-18 12:04 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[17-Sep-18 12:15 AM] sbucks#9217
is there a newer version of 0.2.41d-beta that i need to install before i claim my interest?  i am using native mode

[17-Sep-18 12:32 AM] yorklab#7270
That should be latest.

[17-Sep-18 12:35 AM] sbucks#9217
thanks, i just claimed my interest, and it has over 10 confirmations but the transaction is not showing up in my transaction history but the transparent balance is right  i clicked the refresh symbol on the transaction history but the transaction is still not there. how do i get the transaction to show up?

[17-Sep-18 12:36 AM] yorklab#7270
If it's native  it will be on a new address.

[17-Sep-18 12:37 AM] yorklab#7270
You could check explorer.

[17-Sep-18 12:37 AM] sbucks#9217
true, but shouldnt it be showing on the transaction history section?

[17-Sep-18 12:37 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes

[17-Sep-18 12:38 AM] yorklab#7270
Stop wallet, close then reopen.

[17-Sep-18 12:39 AM] sbucks#9217
how do you stop the wallet first?  or just close the wallet?

[17-Sep-18 12:39 AM] sbucks#9217
i am using the windows version

[17-Sep-18 12:40 AM] yorklab#7270
Actually I always just close it out, shut it down. I also have Windows.

[17-Sep-18 12:41 AM] yorklab#7270
In the upper left under Windows there is an option to close.

[17-Sep-18 12:41 AM] sbucks#9217
i closed it down, and now restarting the agama app

[17-Sep-18 12:43 AM] sbucks#9217
on windows, where is the komodo.dat file located?

[17-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Nabob#5004
%appdata%\komodo folder

[17-Sep-18 12:45 AM] yorklab#7270
beat me to it.

[17-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Nabob#5004
you can also check path of your wallet.dat file, under Agama settings >app info tab
😃

[17-Sep-18 12:47 AM] sbucks#9217
thanks,

[17-Sep-18 12:47 AM] sbucks#9217
but transaction is still not showing in the transaction history for the interest claimed

[17-Sep-18 12:48 AM] sbucks#9217
i found the block using the komodo exporer via the web, but it would be nice  have the transaction listed in the transaction history

[17-Sep-18 12:50 AM] Nabob#5004
transaction will be listed in tx history, after you have one confirmation, just refresh tx history

[17-Sep-18 12:52 AM] sbucks#9217
@Nabob it has over 25 on the block explorer.  come to think of it , it doesnt show the tx i did in august either.  any way to fix it in debug?

[17-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Nabob#5004
i thought, you just claimed your rewards, please post your address here or transaction id which you can see explorer.

[17-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Nabob#5004
and tell us , you used native or lite mode earlier ?

[17-Sep-18 12:59 AM] Nabob#5004
and your agama and OS version

[17-Sep-18 01:00 AM] sbucks#9217
using native , agama v0.2.41d-beta for windows

[17-Sep-18 01:01 AM] sbucks#9217
used native time before

[17-Sep-18 01:08 AM] Nabob#5004
you used native mode, when checking balance  are you checking explorer or agama wallet, i see transaction went successful, all your rewards moved to your change address.

[17-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Nabob#5004
dm me screenshot of your dashboard, your total balance shows you correctly check

[17-Sep-18 01:10 AM] sbucks#9217
@Nabob  checking agama wallet in the transaction history section.  the TX IN and Tx OUT are not listed in the transaction history of the the agama wallet.

[17-Sep-18 01:12 AM] Nabob#5004
please raise support ticket, we will help you troubleshoot this issue
support@komodoplatform.com

[17-Sep-18 01:12 AM] sbucks#9217
will do

[17-Sep-18 01:15 AM] Nabob#5004
if your transparent balance shows correctly, rewards alredy there in your wallet,  rewards details shown in transaction itself

[17-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Nabob#5004
as for your best practice we ask users to send your total balance to your original kmd address after every transaction,
it benefits you in two ways, one your balance will be stored in one address and you have your  private key and other one is your rewards will be calculated on  your total balance

[17-Sep-18 12:39 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
im trying to get into lite on agama but i forgot my seeds, is  there a file i can look at that stores it so i can type it as i stupidly forgot it again after long time not accessing it

[17-Sep-18 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵 Agama doesn't store seed for Lite mode anywhere in your system. did you use any PIN or password to encrypt the seed?

[17-Sep-18 12:51 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
i did something

[17-Sep-18 12:52 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
i even sent coins to lite now trying to compound it

[17-Sep-18 12:55 PM] SHossain#0007
did you save your seed passphrase anywhere in your computer or in a piece of paper?

[17-Sep-18 12:57 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
stupid answer coming ur way no

[17-Sep-18 12:58 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
poss 99.9% no if i did where would it save as default maybe incase i did

[17-Sep-18 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
Agama never saves the seed. You can only encrypt it with password or PIN in lite mode. Without the seed you will not be able to access the funds.

[17-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
i can see balance if i enter address

[17-Sep-18 01:22 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
i don't want access to wallet i just want to get rid of it now and withdraw my funds and retire from kmd project

[17-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
esp on-site wallets, they all to problematic to me to have on-board now with my lifestyle

[17-Sep-18 01:24 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
i quit mining it 2 months ago almost now as i can make more money hashing my gpus doing non crypto jobs and there aint many gpus hashing that other cyber project

[17-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Iminedur⛏💵$ιooοο⛏💵#5052
if most miners realize this other project gpu's can do and the reward per watts used is 10 times higheron lower entry level god bless crypto afterwards esp payment is not in crypto but paypal which most new miners prefer as payment, bit like folding but you get paid no free gpu processing for points like seti projects

[18-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Dr Debt#0891
Error
Can't broadcast transaction
the transaction was rejected by network rules. Missing inputs

[18-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Dr Debt#0891
anyone knwo what this is?

[18-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Hermes#6934
It can happen because of a wrong timeclock setting , also try sending the balance to the same public address it could help with the mix of UTXOs in that particular address for that specific transaction .

[18-Sep-18 12:24 AM] Hermes#6934
let me know if this guide helps , https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/288620545/Transaction+rejected+by+network+rules+Time+Clock+Error+Agama , or if sending the balance back to the same public address helps with the UTXOs and then lets you send the transaction that you need.

[18-Sep-18 12:26 AM] Hermes#6934
if that doesn't help please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com so that we can review this 👍

[18-Sep-18 05:29 AM] Seko#7408
Can someone explain how Einsteinium will use dPoW, if they don’t use a Komodo chain? How it works exactly?

[18-Sep-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a code change to the consensus of the coin.... basically it checks for valid notarizations, and then creates a checkpoint in the chain, and they chain can no longer be reorged back past that checkpoint.

[18-Sep-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
effecivly making a private mining 51% double spend attack almost impossible. In my #private-staked project I am working on, we are using a very fast frequency of notarizations, I doubt it is even possible to 51% attack that coin at all, but we are still in testing phase... I don think frequency that fast is going to be somthing we can take to mainnet.

[18-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Seko#7408
Wow, the answer was faster than my question...;)

{Reactions}
👌 

[18-Sep-18 05:35 AM] Seko#7408
Than can use every other coin this service without being on a Komodo chain? I didn’t realize how that worked. The own code of Einsteinium is changed? it is not an „API“?

[18-Sep-18 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It requires a hard fork in the code to achaive it yes. I guess every coin could use it. I am working on creating a way to have 3rd party notaries, which is almost done and in testing phase, as the main KMD notaries will eventually reach a limit of how many coins they can handle at once.

[18-Sep-18 05:40 AM] Seko#7408
How does Komodo benefit? By payments for the service?

[18-Sep-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
free marketing 🤷

[18-Sep-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no point creating something open source if nodody uses it.

🤙 

[18-Sep-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all notarizations transactions pay an address called the CRYPTO address, anyone who notarizes to KMD has to pay that assset KMD.

[18-Sep-18 05:42 AM] Seko#7408
Is Komodo than running on Einsteinium? Is it than a Komodo chain? Or only a change in the own code?

[18-Sep-18 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not 100% sure on the specifics, and i dont think the code is even finished... Their coin will remain their own coin as I understnad it, they will just have a Hard fork to implement the code chainge.

[18-Sep-18 05:43 AM] Seko#7408
Thank you, that is helpful...

[18-Sep-18 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no problem... Spent the last few weeks figuring out how it all works myself. Really cool stuff 😄

[18-Sep-18 06:38 AM] Seko#7408
Genius...🤙🏽

[18-Sep-18 06:39 AM] Seko#7408
Better for the ecosystem is a migration to Komodo. Do you agree?

[18-Sep-18 09:10 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, could someone please point me to where I can find what the `-ac_params` for KMD are?  (Sry, not sure where to post this.)

[18-Sep-18 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @CrisF KMD blockchain params you can get from `getinfo`. Why you have to start Komodo like this, not just `komodod` without params?
I've runned daemon as `komodod -ac_name=KMD` and `komodo-cli -ac_name=KMD` calls instead of just `komodo-cli` worked for me to interact with Komodo chain

[18-Sep-18 09:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @TonyL .  I knew there must be an easy place to find the info.  Just couldn't think of it 😉

[18-Sep-18 09:37 AM] CrisF#3405
It's not for running it, I just want some more example params to play around with and make a test chain with.

[18-Sep-18 09:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Thought KMD would be a good example.

[18-Sep-18 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually I think I've misinformed you a little bit regards `getinfo` since misunderstood you, sorry 😃 It's actually getting a state for user.
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/example-asset-chains.html here you can find a lot of useful examples of different ACs starting

[18-Sep-18 09:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, yeah, I've been looking at those.  I'd like to see what KMD would look like written with params and use that with the docs to sort it out in my head.

[18-Sep-18 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@CrisF  Have to be something like this:
`komodod -ac_name=KMD -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=300000000  -ac_end=7777777` 
 100000000 premine, 3 KMD reward per block, 100000000 more have to be mined,
but not 100% sure about the math

if blocks and longest chain are not the same after already deploying assetchain... what do i have to do to sync?

[19-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Hermes#6934
you mean that you haven't been able to load fully the asset chain? Blocks and longest chain should be the same after the finish loading the blocks

[19-Sep-18 01:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah they used to be but not anymore...maybe i have to connecct again

I saw this article about how to submit a coin to BarterDEX (https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/154107956/How+to+submit+your+coin+to+BarterDEX), but I didn't see anything about listing fees. I was curious if BarterDEX charges a listing fee, or if it's free? Thanks!

[19-Sep-18 10:13 AM] SHossain#0007
@luke BarterDEX listing is free.

[19-Sep-18 10:14 AM] luke#8628

Hello! Any support available?

[21-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what do you need support with @jasonabis ?

[21-Sep-18 03:46 AM] jasonabis#8549
Hi Gordon. I had an airdrop of MGNX to a KMD address. I want to stake the coins. Don’t know if I should stake them in the agama wallet or in the Linux wallet I have set up. Completely ignorant on all of it.

[21-Sep-18 03:47 AM] jasonabis#8549
Alright was just helping me. I believe I’ve found my address and key in agama settings. Should i import those into the Linux wallet?

[21-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
yes import it to the CLI

[21-Sep-18 03:51 AM] jasonabis#8549

[21-Sep-18 03:53 AM] jasonabis#8549
Hell yes!

[21-Sep-18 03:54 AM] jasonabis#8549
Thx so much! So if I ran that staking command earlier, it should already be staking?

[21-Sep-18 03:56 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It should be, unless you close the wallet earlier after running the command.
