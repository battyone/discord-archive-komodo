what does 'disputed' mean in practical terms?

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
yeah ok that was my question sort of

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
more than one person makes a claim for the same address

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
that triggers the dispute process

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] Keppie#5156
How long was binance/bittrex asked to close kmd deposits ?

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] nocturnal#2177
so why would my address become disputed if not in first batch?

[07-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
soon after we found evidence of stolen funds

[07-Jun-19 09:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
only, the rightful claimant won't know it is disputed- only the unrightful claimant

[07-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
there have been scammers trying to get the old privkeys

[07-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
such scammer would then submit a false claim

[07-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Those with funds under 7777 will get them today?

[07-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is VERY important that you submit a claim

[07-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
that would trigger the dispute process if somebody else made a claim for your funds

[07-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
I promised the < 7777 will get refunds before the 15th

[07-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Alright 👍

[07-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
still have a bunch of custom code to write to process the claims

[07-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i repeat, submit a claim if you havent done so already

[07-Jun-19 09:29 AM] nocturnal#2177
when is cut off for 'first batch'?

[07-Jun-19 09:29 AM] nocturnal#2177
sunday ok?

[07-Jun-19 09:29 AM] nocturnal#2177
at work with imminent deadlines

[07-Jun-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it is up to you

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] nocturnal#2177
when is the cut off?

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] nocturnal#2177
for first batch

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no cutoff

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] nocturnal#2177
so confused 😂

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the next step i have is to send out the special tx to the compromised addresses

[07-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
that are small and undisputed

[07-Jun-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
once you get that you need to spend it to prove you have the privkey

[07-Jun-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
I will process the very small ones first

[07-Jun-19 09:32 AM] nocturnal#2177
ok sounds long, will have to wait. best of luck with all

[07-Jun-19 09:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
do you have timestamps on when the claims were made? as in, the earlier, the more credible?

[07-Jun-19 09:34 AM] 1CryptoTrader#3543
guys, i cant get into my agama wallet?

[07-Jun-19 09:34 AM] miles#6381
What a week - A massive thank you to @jl777c and the entire KMD team for acting so swiftly to protect the community and their funds, being online everywhere at all hours - truly amazing to see, thank you

@jl777c So we'll need to use the compromised seed, right ?

[07-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you need to use the compromised seed

[07-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes the initial contact will tell us which is the imposter. since we have the vast majority of funds already claimed anybody that comes in now will immediately be flagged and investigators put on their trail

[07-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Kaed#8040
Okay. Which way (wallet) is the most easy and fast to do it when i'll need to verify i'm the owner ?

[07-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
anything is fine, it is a compromised privkey anyway

[07-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
you just need to show you have access to it

[07-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Kaed#8040
Yes but i don't want to mess with my oceanqt wallet 😉

[07-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Kaed#8040
(well, no seed there so nvm :p)

[07-Jun-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you could log in to verus wallet with old seed, do the one tx and be done with it

[07-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Kaed#8040
Ok so i'll get verus wallet then 😃

[07-Jun-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
verus wallet is very good

[07-Jun-19 09:44 AM] dxer666#8963
be carefull with scammers . last night someone with simillar id of komodo team, give me all of my data include seed .. email ,tx id and etc...

[07-Jun-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
do not give out your seed to ANYBODY, there is no need for that in the claim process

[07-Jun-19 09:49 AM] tomsmith26#8707
I  filled out the form of fund  return already but I have not yet recieved my funds so  when is it available to get back my KMDs

jl777 announced his plan: most small refunds will be done by june 15, larger or contested ones will take longer but not much: "Believe me, i want to complete all the refunds as soon as possible so we can get back to normal"  #KMD

[07-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Lennart#9331
will you process the small balances only of KMD, or are assets like DEX and VRSC also refunded in that time period?

[07-Jun-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD first

[07-Jun-19 09:50 AM] Malti#3948
@dxer666 somebody gave you your seed??

[07-Jun-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
then onto the other chains

[07-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Lennart#9331
ok thx

[07-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Steve10#5203
@jl777c my sister needs to file a claim but she asked me what txid did you need on the form? I looked at the form and wasn't sure. Is txid on the form the txid of the transaction of kmd team sweeping her wallet?

[07-Jun-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if in doubt, leave it as 0

[07-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Steve10#5203
Lol ok, I'll tell her thanks

[07-Jun-19 09:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I will help you out @Steve10  this weekend

[07-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Steve10#5203
Great job in defending against this by the way

[07-Jun-19 09:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or later today I got to sleep first lol

[07-Jun-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i did the blockchain analysis, so the txid info is not needed anymore

[07-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Steve10#5203

@Malti  no one scammer wanted help me to fill form, and her id was like komodo team members, i sent to him  all info... and finally he said me that you will receive email....he also asked about my discord email..

[07-Jun-19 09:57 AM] Steve10#5203
@jl777c unfortunately it happens to even the best of them like kmd and BNB. It's the way a team handles it that makes or breaks them. CZ did it well and you have too.

[07-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jabe#4227
Hi, just joined - is there much hope that the hackers will get caught, or at least not be able to move stolen funds?

[07-Jun-19 10:03 AM] matspb#7829
What amount would you describe as 'small'  for the purpose of refunding?

[07-Jun-19 10:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Under 7777

[07-Jun-19 10:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jabe  the situation is still under investigation and all the facts need to be considered to decide the best course of action,  when a decision has been made the community will be informed.

[07-Jun-19 10:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Most probably funds will be flagged at minimum and when they touch a CEX the account will be blocked/investigated I assume?

[07-Jun-19 10:08 AM] jabe#4227
@polycryptoblog  Good to know. I'm very impressed with how this situation is being handled, hats off.

Microsoft has a bug in RDP, let's people take control of a remote computer. This is the biggest software giant in the world. RDP is used by millions of people. Bugs/hacks/exploits happen to the best. The important thing is how to solve them. And the komodo team is handling this very well.

[07-Jun-19 10:12 AM] mrlynch#5735
i wouldn't call microsoft the best tho

[07-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Given the technical skill needed to pull off this feat in such a short time, I wouldnt be surprised kmd team is capable enough to find out who is responsible... First and foremost is to make the people whole again, burning people responsible at the cross will follow later :p

[07-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Warkid#2117
To be technical: If the seed was send in one form to a server... how is it possible only the Komodo team had acess to all new entered seeds (the last 2 month) and noone else? So it was send to a Komodo server, right??

[07-Jun-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
not at all

[07-Jun-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
we decoded the exploit and figured out where the data was, and copied it from the hacker

[07-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Warkid#2117
So you were faster than the hacker and he (or she?) did not get anything?

[07-Jun-19 10:37 AM] lion#5837
@jl777c  I have already applied! My funds were swept away to your safe wallet! The balance is now zero - do I still need some kind of transaction?

[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Warkid#2117
If so, you got my respect and i apologize for all I criticized

[07-Jun-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
no problem. i know everybody is stressed out and worried

[07-Jun-19 10:41 AM] lion#5837
@jl777c  I applied for all the instructions, but how can I make sure that it is safely delivered and processed? Will they contact me at discord?

[07-Jun-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 

Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors

Can we assume, the Komodo Ocean QT is a safe wallet? Just asking cause everybody is talking about the Verus.

[07-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
oceanQT is good too

[07-Jun-19 10:53 AM] Warkid#2117
Thank you!

[07-Jun-19 10:56 AM] RAE#3178
Is this special process for both KMD and BTC claims?

[07-Jun-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we are doing KMD first

[07-Jun-19 10:57 AM] techblack#0067
I choose a Destination adress on broker which say if transaction is lower Khan 0,1 KMD they will be Lost. Do i need to refill Form with another adress?

[07-Jun-19 10:58 AM] lion#5837
@jl777c  I filled it out correctly - and I had less than 7777 funds - but I haven’t received anything at the compromised address so far! But I have both the private key of the compromised wallet and access to the wallet of the exchange from which I sent ALL means of accumulation to agama. - what to do with it - is this additional evidence if fraudsters want to challenge my funds?

[07-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Buddz1993#5380
It prob will be send in the next few days no?

[07-Jun-19 11:00 AM] lion#5837
@jl777c  Does this mean if I did not receive a short-cut transaction from you to a compromised address - but I correctly filled out the application form - does this mean that someone else disputes my address? How to make sure that my application has reached? After all, you do not recommend creating more than one application in order to avoid a long resolution of the issue!

[07-Jun-19 11:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@lion please read... target date to start refunds is june 15th... we are 7th now. Wait a week.

[07-Jun-19 11:03 AM] techblack#0067
I need to send at lest 0,11KMD from compromised adress will that be possible or do i need to change Destination adress in Form???

[07-Jun-19 11:04 AM] John the Cashist#7046
@Hollowman9000 Monitor the seed collection point to see if the attacker accidentally uses compromised agama and steal back stolen funds.

That would be brilliant 😄

[07-Jun-19 11:08 AM] lion#5837
@Cryptoon  Thank you - I understood this earlier! it is not clear how to make sure that:
1. My application has reached the right place
2. That my claim is not controversial
3. Where to expect feedback - my discors are indicated in the application - or should I just wait as a positive sign for a mini transaction to my compromised address? and it will happen before the 15th of the month? Thank!

[07-Jun-19 11:08 AM] lion#5837
Or can I send a small amount to the old compromised address now and then from that address, for example, send a transaction to the new VERUS to prove ownership of the private key and seeds?

[07-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[07-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
wait for the special transaction. if you try to make a false one, your account will go into the disputed category

[07-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and that might not get resolved until next month
