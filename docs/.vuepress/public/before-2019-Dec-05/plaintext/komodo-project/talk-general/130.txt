once a month

[11-Nov-18 07:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Hello community. I am new here. Any admin online?

[12-Nov-18 04:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
several

[12-Nov-18 05:05 AM] PesaPepe#8941
Thanks. Is Token card a product that is already working?

[12-Nov-18 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Maybe you should ask the TokenCard people?

[12-Nov-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Every user can opt to fund their TokenCard with ETH and TKN. You can also select as many as five of the following cryptocurrencies: REP, DGD, MKR, ICN, GNT, MLN, SNGLS, and 1ST.`
No part of that lets me understand why you would ask about it here

[12-Nov-18 06:05 AM] PesaPepe#8941
Thanks for your reply. We have a  project to help people learn cryptocurency in Africa and was curiour whether Token Card can be loaded with any ERC20 token

[12-Nov-18 06:07 AM] PesaPepe#8941
We are rewarding those  who attend our face to face instructions with some PEP tokens. Would be great if they could use Token Card to spend their tokens.

The amazon partners page listing Komodo shows an address in San Jose, CA. Anyone here knows what is on that address? I don't think it is jl's office 😃 , and I know a bunch of folks are based in the UK. I was wondering who actually resides there?

@jansako When i initially registered back in April I just used my own address. This has been changed to reflect our new office in Vietnam.

Hi, I  use native mode. After upgrading from 0.2.41d to 0.2.43d , it takes too long to be fully synced, more than 1 day. Is this normal?

Hello good morning

[13-Nov-18 07:51 AM] dokrates#8987
I have a question about agama and claim rewards

[13-Nov-18 07:52 AM] dokrates#8987
I need to have agama wallet open to increase my claim? or i can directly open once a month and take same reward if i have open 24/7 ?

[13-Nov-18 07:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
Agama needs to be open only long enough to perform the transaction to claim the reward.

[13-Nov-18 07:53 AM] dokrates#8987
great!

[13-Nov-18 07:53 AM] dokrates#8987
that is like cold staking

[13-Nov-18 07:53 AM] dokrates#8987
you open time enough to claim the reward once a month, and thats all!

[13-Nov-18 07:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
You got it.

[13-Nov-18 07:54 AM] dokrates#8987
Thanks @actionslacks

[13-Nov-18 07:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
Cold staking, never heard that phrase but I like it.

[13-Nov-18 07:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
No prob @dokrates

what happened to komodo dex page? kicks you to latest news, with no reference to dex

[13-Nov-18 02:18 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Hyper  Yes, we took that page down for the interim website. We will definitely include a DEX page in the fully rebranded website, which is already in progress now

[13-Nov-18 02:19 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We're waiting for marketmaker 2.0 to be completed before giving the DEX a marketing push. We're also creating plans to get more liquidity on the DEX so that it becomes more usable for normal, everyday traders

[13-Nov-18 02:25 PM] Hyper#4601
Ah, thanks Daniel, I had it bookmarked and wanted to play with it as I really hate the interface other dex have, and I was wondering how you are going to present yours

[13-Nov-18 02:26 PM] Hyper#4601
is there anything publically available at the moment that I could look at with regards to dex, or gotta wait until 2.0? (when is it due btw?)

new ecosystem coin ZEX was launched a few hours ago, #zexo channel purpose has the main urls

[13-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Hyper#4601
I am also curious about functionality since most of the dex are so limited in what they offer compared to cex

[13-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Hyper  Sorry but I'm not sure when MM 2.0 will be finished. I think it will be Q1 2019 but can't say for sure

[13-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Daniel CP#2020
There is a #dev-marketmaker channel where you could get some more details about how it will work
