[03-Jun-18 07:46 AM] siddhartha_crypto#0000
@senda I can see the general idea.

The Bitcoin icons are representations of its hash rate.

I tend to think of the image vice versa.

Bitcoin is a river of strength, and KMD is an entrance for your data to go inside it.

Neither is right or wrong. Just a different way of looking at it.

[03-Jun-18 08:46 AM] supersenda#0000
Ok, thanks ;)

[03-Jun-18 08:46 AM] supersenda#0000
The bitcoin icons would be the protective barrier and at the same time transmit their strength to the komodo blockchain. This is the idea that I wanted to convey

KMD Dragon "eating" other chains üôÇ

[04-Jun-18 04:06 PM] jl777#0000
we are not eating anything, we are helping add security to other chains

[04-Jun-18 04:09 PM] digitalninjaa#0000
this is why i like komodo alot - its not about kmd being a dominant project but rather growing the system and branching out. everyone else seems isolated etc

[04-Jun-18 04:09 PM] passcombo.com#0000
what I'm saying is the situation would be the same for them if they simply create a KMD asset right? means their chain would have no future without that. IT becomes part of KMD, so not exactly eating in the sense of destruction, more in the sense of absorption üòõ

[04-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777#0000
I think a more important point is that dPoW can be added to non-KMD coins

[04-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777#0000
we did it with CHIPS, but that being a SuperNET coin, it isnt exactly external project

[04-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777#0000
When I say dPoW is independent from other aspects, the fact that totally unrelated chains can adopt it, is proof

[04-Jun-18 04:11 PM] digitalninjaa#0000
what it does is emphasise the tech thats here and how it can benefit all that want it. the 2fa example is a great way of explaining dpow imo

[04-Jun-18 04:13 PM] digitalninjaa#0000
