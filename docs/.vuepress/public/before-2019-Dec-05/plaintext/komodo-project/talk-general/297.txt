`So there is a election marketing marathon today?`
Yes, it seems censorship brings out the masses

[11-May-19 03:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hehe

[11-May-19 03:11 PM] Alright#0419
whoever is arbitrarily deleting messages, please fuck off. There are no rules against it, it's not up to you to to personally decide what is acceptable and what is not

[11-May-19 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
censorship is one of my buttons 😅

[11-May-19 03:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What about when competition has ban hammering capabilities? :troll:

[11-May-19 03:16 PM] PTYX#6840
you can see it in the logs. no need to make fuzz about it. if someone was doing it on purpose it would be easy to see.

[11-May-19 03:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no fuzz, no fuzz, just vote chainmakers and be a boss! 😂

there are rules against full page spam

[11-May-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c then why isn't this deleted:
https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/428673045767520260/573536781560053770
?

[11-May-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
ok hold on, I'll delete the rest then

[11-May-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
some of them just as large as CG's

[11-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no specific rule against: while ( 1 ) make post
but clearly we wouldnt want to allow that

[11-May-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
a full page post that is repeated provides no new info

[11-May-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
should be deleted in my opinion

[11-May-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a small post done infrequently... it is a gray area, certainly not every minute

[11-May-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no problem if weekly. so somewhere in between is the borderline

[11-May-19 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to 📺 since no matter what he does seems to piss on someone's toast_

[11-May-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a common sense rule here

[11-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
I believe the election spam is bound to happen no matter what, selectively deleting ones does not seem the best way to handle the spam

[11-May-19 03:25 PM] Alright#0419
maybe limit it to a single channel

[11-May-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you want to make more posts, post new content. the same full page post over and over...

[11-May-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i think weekly post is fine

[11-May-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
daily is not, for a full page without new content

[11-May-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want a consistent rule, there it is

[11-May-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and we can make the last day start a new "week"

[11-May-19 03:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
How much until election ends?

[11-May-19 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
72 hours?

[11-May-19 03:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
48?

[11-May-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
just about over anyway, something to consider for next year though

[11-May-19 03:27 PM] Alright#0419
maybe single channel for these kind of messages

@Alright I think it would be nice if the number of each daily voting propaganda is limited to 1

[11-May-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was doing 1 or 2 lines every 31 hours, but that seemed to piss someone off too 🤷🏽_

[11-May-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
identical content repeated is what triggers the spam filter

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] Alright#0419
my point is that 
`→ 3. No spam. No unrelated content (i.e. NSFW and all forms of advertising).`
All of the messages seem to break this rule, so it shouldn't be selectively enforced

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] Strob#3417
Voting is heating up! Thanks to those who sent me more than 750 000 votes so far (4th in NA for the time being!) You won't regret it! That would be my propaganda for the day!

[11-May-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
communicating candidacy is not spam

[11-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
talking to the electorate, is not spam

[11-May-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810

if you have some bot on autorepeat then you cant very well complain about a spam filter that catches that

[11-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
at least post something entertaining

[11-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
or imformative

[11-May-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
or useful

didn't need a bot to post:

[11-May-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seeing the same post in many channels is something you dont like

[11-May-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seeing the same post over and over is something i dont like

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't like it either, but last year I was told to fekoff and accept it; it's litterally why I left for the entire month

[11-May-19 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so I adopted the "when in Rome..." attitude 🤷🏽

[11-May-19 03:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Sorry for the interruption :
Here's another p2sh with 10.777 kmd inside, this one is a bit more difficult than the last one but still fairly easy (I'll increase the difficulty gradually) 😃 
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/bX2r7KGy1QPcVZ3RB28FWKv8w21KSNrrSv
What you need to decipher in order to obtain the secret text: 
cipertext: '`PBRRVCMCZNGVSYW`, ' key: '`NNELECTION`' (the secret text is an english word so you will know right away if your solution is right)
spending condition is still ```... OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUAL```
Good luck with building the script.
And speaking of the election, let me remind everyone that please vote for your favourite candidate before May 13th 23:59:59, and if that happens to be me, here is my voting address : `RFcGrDLnWh1cMiQqMKncFJ6b9cnt8fwKCM` , thanks for the support 😃

by no means is my issue with full pages being removed, my issue is that mine was singled out without warning or comment to me

[11-May-19 03:40 PM] Alright#0419
very unimportant thing to debate, I'm not advocating for allowing election spam. I'm just saying handle it the same way every time

[11-May-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that

[11-May-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i believe i have consistently removed all full page repeated post that I have seen

[11-May-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
too frequent, too big, repeated content, all three were triggered

[11-May-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if i missed any, i apologize for having created a feeling of singling out anybody

[11-May-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i just didnt see anybody else doing it, so if you are the only one doing it, it would feel like you were singled out

[11-May-19 04:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
this is why i don't like politics.. we'll keep building good stuff for pirate regardless of election outcome

been playing a bit with telegram bot api today
wrote my first bot that can check kmd rewards and send notifications if 1 month period is passed or utxos are not generating rewards

Usage examples (or type /help):
/rewards RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS
/rewards-subscribe RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS
/rewards-unsubscribe RDPSgU4kmr3Xq3WSfWdeP5wah7HSP8tdsS

Once an address is subscribed rewards are checked every day. Notifications are sent out every day if the above conditions are met. If not met no notifications.

it's a really quick write up at this point so excuse any annoying tg messages if things go wrong
any bug reports are welcomed and will help me polish everything

bot's user name @kmd_rewards_notifications_bot
