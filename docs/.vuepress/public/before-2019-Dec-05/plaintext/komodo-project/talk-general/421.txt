exchanges tend to not run the --exchange, and if they do it will create fat blocks

[04-Sep-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the big reduction is due to the changing to monthly rewards cap from annual

[04-Sep-19 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can't really force anyone to run anything other than default

[04-Sep-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
txfee is the sum of inputs - sum of outputs. rewards makes the inputs become larger, that is why you see negative txfee for rewards claims more than 0.0001

[04-Sep-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but exchanges like the rewards

[04-Sep-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
since they dont have to stake or anything, it is very convenient for them. it even works for cold addresses

[04-Sep-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
removing the unclaimed rewards is thus technically tricky and would change the equilibrium across the entire ecosystem

[04-Sep-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
--exchange flag was made for exchanges that have to financially account for every satoshi

[04-Sep-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and all these rewards satoshis totally broke their accounting software

[04-Sep-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so it just doesnt add the rewards value to the sum of inputs, meaning all tx will have unclaimed rewards

[04-Sep-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
if only all users claimed rewards, there wouldnt be any problem

[04-Sep-19 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
hostages?

[04-Sep-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
how will you force the exchanges to run that mode?

[04-Sep-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
binance is now distributing rewards to users, so they would need to collect the rewards

[04-Sep-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe all exchanges should do that

can we revist this after we get 2 or 3 months of data on the actual level of unclaimed rewards?

[04-Sep-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks. without knowing this, there is no way to know the appropriate level of effort or urgency for this

Please, give this topic a break

It has been like this for 2 months and there has been no issues so far

[04-Sep-19 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
`-donation=<pubkey>` is probably optimal for CEXs

[04-Sep-19 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
it "donates" all the rewards to the specified pubkey

[04-Sep-19 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
won't mess with their dbs and still claims rewards

[04-Sep-19 07:41 PM] hastrup#8742
Wow what a read most of what have been said I can't have I opinion on but I'm happy that it was in the open so I could read thx for the transparency 👍

[04-Sep-19 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hastrup in the ideal, your opinion holds the same value as the next person
NN, "just a community member", and "large investor" all stand on the same footing

[04-Sep-19 08:06 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yes but I dont have the tech knowledge to have an opinion that I can defend and  when I read though some of it went straight over my head. I have not agree how you have talk to new people. But I support this. 

Here's a solution:
mine the blocks you're "supposed to mine" and let the random transactions happen in the random block they're supposed to be in be mined by who mines it (you know, like mining normally happens when you can't manipulate the probability of getting a specific block)....... But I don't want to start this whole thing again and maybe I should have pm you privat and said that Im agreeing what you are saying. But transparency and a open discussion whit different ideas whit different opinions is the way to go when we only have text based talks.

[04-Sep-19 08:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but I dont have the tech knowledge to have an opinion that I can defend`
ahhh, I thought that's maybe what you were getting at, but wasn't sure
`maybe I should have pm you privat and said ...`
sadly, that creates more problems than it solves
I'd be content if I was alone in my positions and **everyone** spoke their beliefs outside of DMs, but alas it never happens that way 😛

[04-Sep-19 08:17 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 that was the reason I spoke here and not in private. And thx for your way whit words.

Here's a question: Why is there a private notary node channel? Unless security issues concerning the consensus model, why can't the rest of the discussion be public?

[04-Sep-19 09:42 PM] dan.#2473
it (presumably) seems to be 99.8% of where NN discussion takes place

@Deleted User , you know how much i dislike the divulgation of private conversations
especially when out of context and put in a way to defend points i am not precisely defending myself
i am not sure the paste of my dm's helps in anyway to defend your points so please remove them from your site

@dan. it gives NN ops a place to talk about potential active attacks, and also critical bugfixes with security implications. Also we can paste server debug stuff without worrying about giving out sensitive info to attackers. It's actually important for NN ops to have a private place to talk. We also have a public notary channel to talk about stuff that is not sensitive

i dont understand what the big governance issue is here.  jl777 wanted to change things so that NNs get 75% of rewards, closing the underminign loophole, and you didnt like the way he proposed to change it?

[05-Sep-19 01:50 AM] Alexfrog#1338
(was in response to one of dwy's comments)

[05-Sep-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My suggestion was to burn all large reward  blocks, but nobody liked that. :abusedsmily:

[05-Sep-19 01:51 AM] Alexfrog#1338
burn the large blocks! 😄

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, nobody could agree... so just delete it and nobody gets it

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
nobody getting it = all holders split it equally based on stake

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
exactly

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
hurts miners rewards hodlers

[05-Sep-19 01:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i understand why no miners or NNs wanted that

[05-Sep-19 01:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i dont see how centralized exchanges have to do with this

[05-Sep-19 01:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
oh are the big block rewards unclaimed rewards?

[05-Sep-19 01:57 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[05-Sep-19 01:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ah

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i thought those were burnt

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
(well, never came into existence)

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
if you send a tx that could have claimed 10 KMD in rewards but didn't, the miner can claim that 10 KMD

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i didnt realize any miners or NNs got them

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
sometimes they are stupidly large, most assume it's from CEXs

[05-Sep-19 01:58 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it makes more sense now

[05-Sep-19 01:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
honestly those should be burnt, or not able to be claimed

[05-Sep-19 01:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but i understand why miners/NNs want them and are fighting over them

[05-Sep-19 01:59 AM] Mylo#8306
@Alexfrog yes i agree with your opening comment about the quick solution and the over-reaction to "governance".

[05-Sep-19 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its hard forking to burn them, so wasnt an option at the time.

[05-Sep-19 02:00 AM] Mylo#8306
burning is a waste

[05-Sep-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
was cool while it lasted, but I wouldn't mind them going away entirely

[05-Sep-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
competition for them brought a lot of drama

[05-Sep-19 02:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its not important enough to emergency hard for kover
