@gcharang thanks, I must say this part isn't much clear from the description in Composer because it mentions only clusters and not Antara. So from the doc I understand Antara is on by default, right? Because  the doc says If N > 0, Antara is enabled and  the Composer choice is between fungible (ac_cc=100 to 9999)  or not fungible (ac_cc=2 to 99).  There's no ac_cc=0 or ac_cc=1  options.
Anyway my question is since Antara is on, does it mean that all currently ready modules are active by default with their rpc? I see 13 modules in the doc, including channels, faucer, dice, etc...
Perhaps I was confused because I expected you had to pick exactly which modules you need.

@KomodoWorld thanks for the feedback, will ask the dev to make the description better

yes, with the available options in "clusters" section currently, the modules will be enabled in every smartchain created

but there won't be 13 modules available, but about 9

```
dilithium, rogue, sudoku, musig
```
are dynamic modules and they require custom compilation of the daemon based on selection, so they aren't available in the composer yet

even among the static modules there is a way to pick and choose which of the modules are enabled, but that too isn't enabled yet

[20-Jul-19 07:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Great, I understand now. In fact it isn't clear what is already available and what will be enabled in future

[20-Jul-19 07:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Of course it's all possible from cli

No, when did you heard this?

Would be cool if Magnum decides to integrate the AtomicDex API into the Magnumwallet 😬😎 🐊

@Acura there's a few wallet providerd waiting to begin integration. Chameleon and Magnum are two of those apps. We'll likely see many more implementations though

@Donnie This is from the recent AMA:

Q. Are there established companies showing interest in Komodo platform? If so, which ones and in which sectors?

We have an active pipeline of potential customers currently evaluating smart chains and Komodo’s new Antara Framework. We are currently working on a few strategic opportunities while building out a partner network to provide subject matter expertise across all major industry verticals. 

Q. Any fortune 500 companies or big names are testing Antara or interested in it already?

Yes, there is interest from very big companies. We can’t disclose more at this point.

When they are ready, I'm sure we'll hear about them.

do you mean the interest? yes it's like old komodo agama

[20-Jul-19 08:43 PM] napa#5694
thanks man, yeah its just a habit of mine calling it residuals

[20-Jul-19 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@KomodoWorld if I have to adjust to the sperm-cell, you have to stop calling it "interest"

@KomodoWorld sorry but one more question, am reading up on the faq etc and i was wondering those this wallet have support from the komodo admins/devs? just wondering cos it seem to be its own coin too,  albeit i haven't done a detailed search on it but i get weary with 3rd party cos they can up and leave u dry at any moment.

decentralization is the basis but we also need tools? no? I installed whatsapp on my father's phone I sent him an msg he replied via sms: troll: adoption will also come through some centralization

[21-Jul-19 03:15 AM] owerache#0341
do you have an opinion on the subject  @jl777c

[21-Jul-19 03:16 AM] owerache#0341
I'm trying to convince myself that the decentralization of the DEX type is healthy for the ecosystem... I'm not convinced that this is what will lead to adoption...

[21-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
just like people hate KYC, but whatever DEX you got, the exit and entry point is FIAT
