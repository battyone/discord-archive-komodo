Everything out is what I‚Äôm hearing

[05-Jun-19 01:32 AM] bishop#9773
How about logging in with a private key in Agama, move funds?

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Alright#0419
Any seed you have used in lite mode in the past ~3 months, move funds from it

please go to #support

[05-Jun-19 01:33 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
Surely, it should affect Pirate, because the same seed is used (at least in previous versions of Agama, I had a lite mode KMD , native mode Pirate wallet)?

[05-Jun-19 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
Pirate does not have lite mode.

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] AkiraX#8269
So my private key used in agama is fine

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] AkiraX#8269
Or do I need to move stuff around

[05-Jun-19 01:35 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
" if you created or used your seed phrase with Agama please deinstall it, stop using it and immediately rotate your seeds and move all your coins out from there" - Sorry, instruction is not so clear, as you cannot move funds without using Agama - or are you suggesting using another wallet software to move funds with?

I've never used or activated lite mode. Always native only. Is that an issue?

[05-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Patziggy#9371
Hopefully this is the right place to ask this. Just heard about the Agama wallet security issue and am trying to install the OceanQT

I have the seed phrase, so would it be possible just to reinstate the wallet on the OceanQT implimentation?

My issue seems to be an inability to install the OceanQT implimentation altogether, via the error cited above

@Deleted User uninstall Agama, install VRSC's agama(see pinned message in #support )

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] Alright#0419
@Patziggy Please use VRSC's Agama for the time being if you're having trouble with OceanQT

[05-Jun-19 02:22 AM] jacman#4756
Agama needs hardware wallet support. Is it on the roadmap? Would it have prevented this issue?

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] Patziggy#9371
@Alright I created a new address and priv key as @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator suggested. Is it safe to uninstall the Komod Agama wallet now and install the VRSC Agama wallet in its place?

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
@Patziggy yes

I‚Äôm confused do I install this oceanQT and send everything in my agama there?

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Alright#0419
easiest solution seems to be VRSC's version of Agama. Download it, create a new seed with the VRSC version, note down the address, log out, log in with old seed and send funds to new address

@Tek DAMG LOL what you had ?haha

Cannot recommend Coinomi as it's closed source. Best to use VRSC's fork of Agama is possible

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
Coinomi is likely not a bad option tbh, but again closed source, we have no idea if it's also affected

If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

[05-Jun-19 03:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
native mode are ok (unless you used the privatekey of your native wallet to login into Agama lite mode), seeds for SPV are potentially at risk. Details and reasons will be released once it is safe to do so, and people have had a chance to secure funds.

[05-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Alecandro#1179
Do you have a timeframe on ‚Äúwhen it‚Äôs safe to release information‚Äù?

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
no, nor do we have an agreed upon timeframe for when logins were unsafe

[05-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So all SPV servers are down
