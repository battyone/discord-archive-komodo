well said

[11-Apr-19 05:24 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Did we write any case study where any business implemented komodo and benefited out of it?

[11-Apr-19 05:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
To further that, those that understand blockchain and business infrastructure would do welll to craft sales narratives and plans for specific industries, while also listening to input on needs.

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap working on KomodoreGames as a portal to the world of the technical capabilities.   We will have a blockchain gaming expo in June and hopefully a bigger one in November.

[11-Apr-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent seen (m)any case studies

[11-Apr-19 05:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hehe. I like that Coin already is saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äù - this is a sign he‚Äôs emotionally genuine and playing on a team.

I think komodo's success lies in enterprise adoption ... giving them asset chain as "build your own blockchain solution"  +  tooling + open source libraries and komodo ecosystem

[11-Apr-19 05:31 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what you guys think?

[11-Apr-19 05:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs different things to different people

[11-Apr-19 05:32 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
KMD provides shovels for people to use. To use it dig a grave, to find gold , to bury treasure or any other use cases , that's what everybody in the crypto/blockchain industry are exploring.

[11-Apr-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
short of a few niches, I'm not sure where a public ledger would be any benefit in most enterprise solutions

[11-Apr-19 05:34 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
yes enterprise will never come on public blockchains.... but asset chain can be private correct?

[11-Apr-19 05:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
they can

[11-Apr-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
well currently. private only by nobody knowing their parameters

[11-Apr-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is known, then people could connect to it

[11-Apr-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
of course a CC that limits access is possible to make

[11-Apr-19 05:37 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
one example how to recognise tech adoption is Hiring.. sometime i spend time in hiring portals and freelance site and try to identify what sort of talent people are hiring .. thats give me picture what tech is trending ..

[11-Apr-19 05:39 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Enterprises are heavily betting on hyperledger .. and thats a huge market... though if we go that direction then I think its not good for KMD token? am I correct?

[11-Apr-19 05:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not sure if this is a good use case - secure customers data storage , since there are a lot of leaked customers data recently. üòÑ

[11-Apr-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure it makes sense to compete against hyperledger, they are making everything all corporate and that is not really our area

[11-Apr-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but that isnt to say, corporate solutions cant be built on top of the base platform

[11-Apr-19 05:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
thats also true..there is no governance and tech can be mold based on usecases

[11-Apr-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
as the platform itself is being designed to be able to solve all the blockchain issues, from security, speed, scaling, latency, etc

[11-Apr-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea with CC is to create a custom solution for a specific usecase, so it is like an ASIC vs CPU mining

[11-Apr-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
takes more work to make, but once made, nothing else can approach its performance (other than next gen iterations)

"the idea with CC is to create a custom solution for a specific usecase" some examples?

The entire section of #cc channels

[11-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is a good start

[11-Apr-19 05:47 PM] SHossain#0007
go down few sections on the left menu, the section is called `SMART CONTRACTS`

[11-Apr-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but the really custom CC are created by combining existing one and adding custom logic, like the MARMARA project

[11-Apr-19 05:48 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
basically in simple words  CC are smart contracts ..just like ethereum has

[11-Apr-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
not at all

[11-Apr-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the big problem, people assume this and it is totally incorrect

[11-Apr-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
a single CC could implement solidity

[11-Apr-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets use the rogue CC as an example

[11-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the rogue CC logs the user keystrokes as they play the game and at the end of the game they can submit a claim to the blockchain

[11-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
which then replays the entire game to see what the result is

[11-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jorian#4555
`we have one CC in development that is a JS CC, where you can run javascript` aka LISK

[11-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes do this, so there is no way to forge the data

[11-Apr-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and it converts the ingame gold to actual ROGUE coins and the ingame playerdata to NFT

[11-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the NFT can then be bought/sold via the token DEX

[11-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
or used in a new game

[11-Apr-19 05:52 PM] jl777c#5810
while theoretically you could do this with ETH/solidity, the gas costs would likely be crazy for each game. and long the nodes running rogue need to bother with all the rogue calculations

[11-Apr-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
now rogue is just an example, basically any deterministic random process can use the same methods

[11-Apr-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
there is the heir CC, that is much simpler. it lets you setup an address and an heir. If ever the specified amount of time goes by without you using the address, the heir is able to. no need to refresh things, it automatically adjusts the first block the heir can access the funds

[11-Apr-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the dilithium CC, which adds the quantum resistant algo for making payments, the consensus rule is changed so you need the dilithium privkey in addition to the normal one to properly sign transactions. the fundamental signature scheme is changed

[11-Apr-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the trustless oracles, which allows the creation of trustless pricefeeds. that is still in development, but it has many usecases

[11-Apr-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
with CC you can change the blockchain consensus rule with whatever logic you can conceive of

i have demonstrated this with the very wide range of initial CC that i have written, but it is of course turing complete, so there is no limit to what can be done

[11-Apr-19 05:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
got it .. CC are for asset chains correct?

[11-Apr-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Apr-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC that can create a tokenized crypto, or a 1:1 sidechain

[11-Apr-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
channels CC that allows decentralized instant p2p payments (after channel is created)

[11-Apr-19 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
CC for external pegs such as stablecoins.

and you can use tokens with it, so you can send BTC denominated tokens, that are valid as soon as they are in the mempool,but it is secured by dPoW

sudoku CC, tetris CC

[11-Apr-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
rewards CC that emulates the financial behavior of masternodes. so you get what most people want the masternodes for, without any overhead

[11-Apr-19 06:00 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Basically it increase programmability of asset chains ... other than parameters ..CC makes asset chains programmable  ,., also CC can be used as a template to bring in some functionality in your asset chain

[11-Apr-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are using existing CC, then with just issuing rpc calls you can implement your dapp

[11-Apr-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need custom functionality, you can make a dynamically linked in CC with that functionality

[11-Apr-19 06:02 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
`Basically CC increase programmability of asset chains ... other than parameters ..CC makes asset chains programmable  ,., also CC can be used as a template (i want payment channel  ..some one already made..i just need to copy paste that CC ) to bring in some functionality in your asset chain` my understanding here is correct?

[11-Apr-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it is easier

[11-Apr-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_import=KMD -ac_name=SIDECHAIN

[11-Apr-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
you would just specify on the command line that it it is a sidechain

[11-Apr-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
for the pegs, it would be like ./komodod -ac_name=KUSD -ac_peg=USD -ac_import=KMD

[11-Apr-19 06:05 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
edited above

[11-Apr-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that would make a chain called KUSD that makes a USD peg, backed by KMD

[11-Apr-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_name=KCAD -ac_peg=CAD -ac_import=DOGE

you just need to use the already existing CC

[11-Apr-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
only if you need a custom CC do you need to write any code

[11-Apr-19 06:07 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Got it

[11-Apr-19 06:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
With the above CC and several others,  from my perspective KMDs place is an endogenous commodity currency not as an enterprise solution .  But there is room for both and many other interpretations and strategies

I dont see it as komodo (the open source project) job to create the finished products, but rather to create the tech that others can use to create the finished products

[11-Apr-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
via CC a totally brand  new consensus blockchain can be created, with about 1% the effort of creating something from scratch

[11-Apr-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there really are not that many different consensus algo to date, PoW, PoS, variations on the same basic ideas, i guess ouroborous, DAG, but really just a few dozen different consensus algorithms

[11-Apr-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
in the last 6 months, I have made about 20 different blockchain consensus algorithms via CC

[11-Apr-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
about the same as everybody else combined

[11-Apr-19 06:19 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"I dont see it as komodo (the open source project) job to create the finished products, but rather to create the tech that others can use to create the finished products"  I disagree here.. because adoption is our problem .. we need put effort to deliver some products initially (at least help them as any way possible ) to showcase komodo platform usecase and tech

[11-Apr-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
