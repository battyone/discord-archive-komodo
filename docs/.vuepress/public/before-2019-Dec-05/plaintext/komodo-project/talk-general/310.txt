it does, but it happens less frequently in bear markets

not every asset needs to be excessively back-and-forth traded to be fulfilling its purpose

@dukeleto  thank u dukeleto, what should i do be in the proper position to participate in future profit sharing, I’d like to buy some more

[26-May-19 02:43 PM] crumb#2550
owning SuperNET is taking a long term view and a corresponding position in the success of whole Komodo ecosystem

[26-May-19 02:45 PM] crumb#2550
it won't happen overnight and most SuperNET holders are not interested in short term gains. there are different instruments for that purpose 😃

[26-May-19 05:16 PM] crumb#2550
@belmondo that is an interesting question to ask. if you visit Komodo official website, there are weekly Tech Tuesday updates available

[26-May-19 05:16 PM] crumb#2550

@Regnar it's official and intended for advanced users

[27-May-19 03:49 PM] Regnar#6164
I thought developers.komodo was official and docs.komodo is depreciated or moved to unofficial

[27-May-19 03:50 PM] SHossain#0007
developers.komodoplatform.com is for developers
docs.komodoplatform.conf for advanced users and devs alike

Yesterday I posted a youtube link about cats in #safespace , my link got deleted, then I posted a question asking why my link was deleted, the question got deleted as well ...
I don't mind if a mod/admin deleted my  posts, as long as you can explain what I did wrong, what rule I violated, if any, so I won't repeat the same mistake again ? 😕

[28-May-19 02:06 PM] PHBA2061#2530
that's what I don't understand, the youtube link that I posted is about cats ....

[28-May-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
do you need to be reeducated about what #safespace means?

it is the only channel where there is extreme censorship to protect the women and children

[28-May-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
you posted a video about a cat being pushed down the stairs

[28-May-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if you feel that belongs in #safespace, the drones will need to be sent out for some reeducation

and discussion about what is unsafe, that would make people feel unsafe

Does KMD use 3rd party for Atomic Swaps?

[29-May-19 01:18 AM] napa#5694
so, i have a komodo wallet from 2017 holding a few thousand kmds, i tried to open it but it wasn't syncing. anyway, i download a new agama wallet from the website, then i save the agama file from  the appdata file. i ran the new wallet then it uninstalled the old wallet and i was able to reinstall the new wallet. just wondering if there is anyway for me to restore my wallet from the files on that appdata, cos i have looked everywhere and i can't find the seed node for my original wallet. i haven't used the wallet so long that i figured the wallet.dat would be in the appdata file but it seem this wallet does not have a wallet.dat. anyway, plz any help would be appreciated. i had close to 2800 kmd on that wallet that i have been holding since 2017 and it will be a shame to lose it all

[29-May-19 02:17 AM] napa#5694
by the way going thru my old dat files, i see one that i labelled komodo.dat, but am not seeing any dat file in the appdata of this new wallet to repalce that old .dat with

[29-May-19 02:20 AM] napa#5694
i don't remember i set up the wallet back in 2017 and only opened it one ;ast yr, to see how much funds it has accrued from sitting on the wallet. i just figured everything will be saved from the folder in the appdata. Also i have the old .dat that i saved on my ext drive but am not really sure where to input it /if it wa feasible to recover from it

@Cruz X (10) no that is the great thing about komodo

[29-May-19 07:13 AM] PTYX#6840
@Cruz X (10) no, atomic swaps are native and they don't use proxy tokens

[29-May-19 07:59 AM] napa#5694
by the way, i think i figured out my issue, been a while i used this wallet. forgot u can individual add each asset in agama. anyway, wondering, if there is a snapshot for loading kmd? been loading for approx 4hrs and still at 4.7%

[29-May-19 09:58 AM] majors#9223
are these bootstraps faster than just redownloading the blockchain from agama? I am in a similar boat

[29-May-19 10:04 AM] majors#9223
I have to wait until the entire chain syncs to see my balance?

[29-May-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
yes

[29-May-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
that could take a while

[29-May-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
if you know where the data directory is, you can download a bootstrap

[29-May-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
it will still do a rescan on your wallet, and that too will take a while

[29-May-19 10:13 AM] majors#9223
i know where the data directory is, but when I tried to do that with a copy of the blockchain from another machine I got an "invalid database" error

[29-May-19 10:13 AM] majors#9223
I think the wallet has already been rescanned

nope

[29-May-19 10:32 AM] majors#9223
no idea on either count then

[29-May-19 10:49 AM] crumb#2550
NINJA was dropped just before VOTE2019 tokens and it was the same amount iirc, so in all likelihood it was a preparation to get the vote airdrop right @jansako

[29-May-19 10:50 AM] jansako#3330
