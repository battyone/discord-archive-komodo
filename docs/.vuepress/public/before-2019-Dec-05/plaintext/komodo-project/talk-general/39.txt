It's maybe just a strategy - they've perhaps arranged for a thunderclap type campaign, vote in the last hour to stop the other coins listed from pushing too hard? #complacency?

They said they only have the resources to write and design ONE series. Is it possible for our community to provide resources for them  so they CAN also do a series for KMD?

[04-Aug-18 02:12 PM] yorklab#7270
Another option may be to do both but just one at a time. Do one, then when it's time for another, no vote is necessary, just do Komodo next.

[04-Aug-18 02:13 PM] yorklab#7270
Unfortunately, these votes are a way for them to get exposure, so they probably wont' go that route.

[04-Aug-18 02:13 PM] crumb#2550

hello how do you stake coin? and what type of wallet can stake coin?

[05-Aug-18 06:00 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@IamTrader Komodo doesn't need staking, it's a PoW coin

[05-Aug-18 06:01 AM] IamTrader#6042
oh okay, what about the passive income? that you hold on your wallet will it work using ledger nano S?

[05-Aug-18 06:02 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the passive income is automatic, no need to stake. Unfortunately Ledger doesn't support it

[05-Aug-18 06:02 AM] IamTrader#6042
what type of settings needed for the Agama wallet?

[05-Aug-18 06:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
in lite mode you only need to save the passphrase, with full mode you download all the blockchain and need to backup the wallet.dat file

[05-Aug-18 06:12 AM] IamTrader#6042
okay can also use lite mode with passive income right?

Why Investors Should Pay Attention to Komodo (KMD)
The Money Makers Club now has 6 of 15 available seats. Learn more here! The Komodo (KMD) platform can trace its roots back to 2014’s BitcoinDark, before it underwent a fork of the Zcash blockchain, and an eventual coin rebrand in March of 2018. Another re-polish of sorts is...

Hi, 
Komodo has just been added to ZelTreZ. Komodo is supported in both light and full node as well as is present on both built in exchanges: Changelly and Shapeshift!

I don't think so, we could potentially. May need to liaise with the Komodo Team 🙂

Hey guys can you please vote for KMD's sister coin HUSH to be listed on the https://sonox.io exchnage
We're currently rank number 2 with only a couple hundred votes from first place.  Hush publicity will help KMD grow too. The vote requires no info and takes just a couple seconds to click. You can vote twice per day aswell, one with Wi-Fi and one with mobile data. Much love and appreciation to you all

Well in zeltrez you own the private and the entire security of your account. So I assume that you are eligible to somehow claim the reward. In agama there is a button for it so I would like to put similar button into zeltrez. Is there any documentation on how it technically works? Right now the only option is to take your private key and paste into agama and hit the claim and it will show in zeltrez as a new transaction. @KomodoWorld

@benohanlon any chance of you **not** tagging "everyone" in #official📢 when you've already spammed the info in multiple channels? ☝🏿

[06-Aug-18 01:24 PM] crumb#2550
yes, please

[06-Aug-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
you can't disable the in-app notifications (if you can, I've never seen the option)

[06-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you mute the server you only see the red 1 at the channel I think

[06-Aug-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or otherwise mute the channel itself?

[06-Aug-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, and they you have to unhide a ton of shit or guess where/why you were tagged to make it go away

[06-Aug-18 02:02 PM] crumb#2550
speaking strictly for myself, i would still like to receive notifications. it's just totally unnecessary to ping people about the same message in different channels

Dear @BitcoinMagazine,
This is a request for a detailed review of the @KomodoPlatform.
I believe this platform needs much attention considering their features such as security, scalability, privacy, atomic swaps, etc.
Do you have someone who could brutally review this tech?

We have switched to using "payments to addresses" instead of "chain transactions" for @KomodoPlatform, as in this case, the metric is closer to the "trades for a goods and services". https://t.co/1oQSd8CtKj

thanks! It seems the value didnt change much though.

[06-Aug-18 07:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes the transacted volume also plays a role in the calculation as thats still the same the number did not change much. I can imagine after height 1m we see an increase in daily transacted volume currently its between 2m to 5m kmd / 24 hours

[06-Aug-18 09:33 PM] pablomp#1061
You are welcome guys! 🙂 @jl777c @CHMEX

[06-Aug-18 09:35 PM] pablomp#1061
Exactly, now the average payment value is lower than it was before, that is why the fair value didn't change so much. But now the metric is closer to the proper one (trade for goods and services), and thus, the fair value should be more accurate.

[07-Aug-18 06:19 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Pablo do you store the FV index (best 1h avg) in some db? might be interesting to try this predictor for price trends as an additional factor, when there will be min 6m history

[07-Aug-18 07:37 AM] pablomp#1061
Hello @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 Do you mean if I store it in an hourly basis?

[07-Aug-18 07:40 AM] pablomp#1061
Currently I am working just with a daily resolution. Nonetheless, the current day data is updated every hour.

[07-Aug-18 11:40 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yes storing, should not take too much space, so may be worth storing

[07-Aug-18 01:12 PM] benohanlon#1119
@ComputerGenie @crumb @webworker01 our marketing team is four man strong. We need the help and support of our community to share and evangelise. Using everyone means I can make sure people see what's happening. If it's a big problem for you then consider disabling notifications.

[07-Aug-18 01:14 PM] benohanlon#1119
It's much easier to complain than it is to add value. I've used everyone a couple of times in a day at most.

[07-Aug-18 01:15 PM] benohanlon#1119
And you're right I do sometimes share cross channels... because I want news or votes to be seen. Some people aren't in all channels.

[07-Aug-18 01:16 PM] benohanlon#1119
thanks @webworker01 - your advice is excellent. It solves the problem for the person who has the problem.
