Which partnership are we talking about?

[01-Aug-18 05:09 PM] Meyse#0952
For example this partnership with kreds,cred,kred(?), it is only listing kmd on their app right? Is that called a "partnership"?

[01-Aug-18 05:12 PM] Meyse#0952
And what did the partnership with Populous mean? Like, specific?

[01-Aug-18 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I am not aware of the gritty details. Maybe business dev can provide more information.

[01-Aug-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Partnership: integration, support, comarketing.   Populous was supposed to be for integrating invoice factoring into Komodo ecosystem but due to some concerns we have had with them, we have decided to shelf that relationship .

I've read about your project, and it caught my attention. I didn't know about it. I'm checking out your website, but it feels like you guys don't even have a professional graphic designer in your team. I know it might not be as important to you guys, but I'm having a hard time trusting a project with such an amateur looking website.
