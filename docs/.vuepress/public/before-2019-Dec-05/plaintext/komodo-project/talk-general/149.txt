because the reorg will negate their work if "they lose"

[14-Dec-18 06:41 AM] lord kek#0511
if the game resets every 10 minutes, you have less stake in the game

[14-Dec-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
both networks' miners are incentivized to act in network's best interest

[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] lord kek#0511
well, I think that's different issue. This is not about specific attack. For the purpose of this, you could imagine bored saudi price just doing it for giggles and laughters

[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
doing?

[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] lord kek#0511
mining empty blocks to get on the front page of reddit or what ever reason

[14-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Alright#0419
so what's the difference if they do it on pirate or btc?

[14-Dec-18 06:45 AM] lord kek#0511
well if they start doing it with btc, the network has 16.5 hours before the game resets. So the "honest" side can keep on mining blocks to keep the network running and they have that time frame to compete to be the chain with most work

[14-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Alright#0419
the "honest" side will mine the chain with greater pow

[14-Dec-18 06:46 AM] Alright#0419
not battle it out

[14-Dec-18 06:46 AM] lord kek#0511
so they can get more hash rate to fight the attacker and they are insentiviced to do so, because they are protecting the mining rewards they have already "wasted"

[14-Dec-18 06:46 AM] lord kek#0511
naturally they have other insentives too, but they have that to lose

[14-Dec-18 06:48 AM] lord kek#0511
with pirate, there can only be rewards of 10 prior block at stake, because the notarization will reset the game

[14-Dec-18 06:48 AM] lord kek#0511
so, that's the most you can have at stake?

[14-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Alright#0419
miners have no perspective of "attacker" vs "honest" chain. They only know if it is valid or invalid. "honest" miner are incentivized to mine on the longest chain, not battle an "attacking" chain

[14-Dec-18 06:49 AM] lord kek#0511
Also, where did you get this 99 block reorg limit?

Is there a limit to how many blocks can be rolled back from a 51% ...
I was wondering if we where to ever face a 51% attack is there some sort of limit as to when the longest chain doesn't matter? For example if I owned 51%+ of the network, mined 1000 blocks privatel...

it's in zcash at least, assumed it came from core

I don't think such limit exists

I don't think this is true. Or it might be, but it doesn't matter. My imaginary saudi prince could decide it will mine only on top of his own block, no matter what the other miners do

[14-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
it is true

[14-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
and it does matter

[14-Dec-18 06:52 AM] Alright#0419
I really have no idea what you're trying to get at

[14-Dec-18 06:53 AM] lord kek#0511
If I have enough hash rate, I can ignore what ever blocks propagate thru the network and decide to only include my own blocks, it's not a matter of what the other miners do or don't. All that matters is the chain with most accumulated work

[14-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Dec-18 06:54 AM] lord kek#0511
but this changes the dynamics of the game as far as I can see

[14-Dec-18 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If I get what your saying... you want to 100% attack a chain mining onl;y emply blocks so that nobody can use it?

[14-Dec-18 06:55 AM] lord kek#0511
but if the attacker is going to run out of money, how are the others any different?

[14-Dec-18 06:55 AM] lord kek#0511
they have the cost too, hence they are incentivized to protect the rewards at stake

[14-Dec-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you are mining a coi, its in your best intrests to ket people use the network, or you will drive its value to zero.

[14-Dec-18 06:56 AM] lord kek#0511
no no, I'm not talking about specific attack and I have no idea how this would ever be profitable. So I'm not suggesting this is valid attack because of reasons x or y

[14-Dec-18 06:57 AM] lord kek#0511
so there is no question about is this reasonable or profitable or if anybody outside of imaginary saudi princes ever gonna do it

[14-Dec-18 06:57 AM] lord kek#0511
but I do think the game theory is different, because I think you can more easily disturb the miners that just... well mine like miners usually do

[14-Dec-18 06:58 AM] lord kek#0511
because the "competition" resets every 10 minutes, the "honest" miners can only ever try to sprint to win the next period of 10 minutes

[14-Dec-18 07:01 AM] lord kek#0511
where with bitcoin, the sprint doesn't exist, the network will consider the valid chain with most work the one that stands, there are no if's or buts, no checkpoints. Longer the "attack" continues, more each side has to lose, hence they are more incentivized to protect the block rewards they have accumulated

[14-Dec-18 07:01 AM] lord kek#0511
Does that make sense?

[14-Dec-18 07:02 AM] lord kek#0511
also I apologize if these are retarded questions. I heard about PirateChain yesterday, had a conversation with the guy.

[14-Dec-18 07:03 AM] lord kek#0511
So I'm totally not any kind of expert on anything ðŸ˜„

[14-Dec-18 07:04 AM] lord kek#0511
also first I heard about dPoW, so I got curious what is the fuzz about

[14-Dec-18 07:06 AM] lord kek#0511
Tho, even if I can't demonstrate how this would be beneficial to anybody or give good reasons why this would happen, I don't think it's trivial issue

[14-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
They are incentivized to mine on the greatest proof of work chain

[14-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
you keep saying they are incentivized to keep the BRs they have mined, but that's not the case. They are incentivized to mine the longest chain as that chain is the most likely to survive

[14-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Alright#0419
mining on a shorter chain means any block you mine if very likely to be orphaned

[14-Dec-18 07:13 AM] lord kek#0511
they are not incentivized to mine the longest chain if the longest chain is princes chain, who won't build on top of their block even if the "honest" miners decide to follow the prince's chain. If they do that and the prince manages to keep it up, they never get anything, because their blocks won't be on that chain

[14-Dec-18 07:14 AM] lord kek#0511
I think if they blindly did that, they would not be working against the prince at all

[14-Dec-18 07:15 AM] lord kek#0511
also, how can you say they are not incentivized to to keep their BR's isn't that where they get their money?

[14-Dec-18 07:16 AM] lord kek#0511
If you need some reason why this would ever happen, take what Greg Wright was foaming about, he said he would mine empty blocks on abc, just to mess with them. Does that make sense? Sure doesn't, but that's what he said he would do

[14-Dec-18 07:17 AM] lord kek#0511
would you say the abc's correct response to that attack would be to just keep on attempting to get their blocks on gregs version of abc ledger?

[14-Dec-18 07:18 AM] lord kek#0511
or should the abc people attempt to mine a version of the ledger that actually has transactions in it?

[14-Dec-18 07:25 AM] lord kek#0511
Also, as a side note, it's not the longest chain (even tho satoshi worded it such and later corrected it), it's the chain with most accumulated work. I assume that's what you meant, but there's a significant difference. 
edit: Actually scrap this, different issue. I think you were referring to this scenario, You meant the miners are incentivized to abandon their work every time the prince broadcasts longer chain, even without any transactions but his own.

[14-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
any time I said longest chain I meant greatest pow work chain

[14-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
an oversimplication

[14-Dec-18 07:33 AM] Alright#0419
I still have no idea what you're getting at. Are you wondering about anything in particular?

[14-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Alright#0419
You're describing an attack vector that is *very* well known and documented, and I honestly have no idea how it relates to your original questions

[14-Dec-18 07:36 AM] lord kek#0511
oh, sorry to have wasted your time, could you refer me to that documentation?

[14-Dec-18 07:37 AM] lord kek#0511
I've spent all of 3hours ish thinking about this, so I'm bot claiming to be onto something huge or saying this or that is better or worse. I just got curious how this dPoW thing works.

[14-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure there is a specific name for what you described. There are plenty of papers on selfish mining if you just google though

[14-Dec-18 09:16 AM] lord kek#0511
@Alright  This documentation would likely have to be from the dPoW camp, because the my original question is, how does the dPoW change the game theory compared to PoW. Tho I might be wrong, seeing how btc had checkpoints in the past and abc has them now. Which this notarization basically is (checkpointing).

[14-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
Sorry, not an analyst. I guess I shouldn't have tried to answer any questions on game theory

[14-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
It's a very general question. If you break it down into different aspects of the game theory, I'd better understand what you are asking

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] lord kek#0511
related to this, do you happen to know how forks are settled? I mean how does the network settle on changes of the consensus rules? With btc this is fairly simple, because it's effectively competing rulesets attempting to accumulate most work and "winner" is the one who endures. Either the other side shuts down and joins the new ruleset or the coin forks permanently. With dPoW, I don't think you could do this, because of the checkpointing.

[14-Dec-18 09:21 AM] lord kek#0511
talking about hard forks

[14-Dec-18 09:22 AM] lord kek#0511
I'm also not analyst, just curious person ðŸ˜„

[14-Dec-18 09:23 AM] lord kek#0511
tho it's easier to ask questions than answer to them. One crazy person can ask questions that 10 wisemen aren't able to answer to. I'm fairly comfortable with the idea that I'm the crazy person here.

[14-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
notaries will follow whatever ruleset they have and will continue to notarize the chain following their ruleset

[14-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Alright#0419
a differing ruleset would not receive dpow

[14-Dec-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
it all depends on which nodes the notaries are running. in the case of BCH and BSV for example, notary nodes would stick to BCH and whenever BSV wanted to get dPoW, notary nodes would install BSV full nodes and start notarizing this chain.

[14-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
both BCH chains hard forked

[14-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Alright#0419
notaries would have needed to choose a side

[14-Dec-18 09:42 AM] jorian#4555
yes, that's true. bad example

[14-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
game theory of mining is indeed changed, but only slightly

[14-Dec-18 09:50 AM] lord kek#0511
So how does one hard fork then? Who controls these notaries?

[14-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
vast majority of the game theory about mining is to make sure you are mining on the right chain

[14-Dec-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
with dPoW the longest chain that is notarized, is the right chain

[14-Dec-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so whenever the prince releases publicly the longest notarized chain, that becomes the valid chain

[14-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and unless the prince has 100% of the blocks anytime somebody that isnt the prince mines a block, there will be a block full of tx

[14-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so any censorship would be temporary

[14-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as the incentive to mine to preserve the longest chain disappearing after 10 blocks, maybe that is some secondary issue for some miners, but really, it is a very small effect

[14-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
far more important is to be mining on the right chain.

[14-Dec-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you are selfish mining, the game theory changes to make it so that it is very dangerous to do it

[14-Dec-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
even if you have dominant hashrate, as when the next notarization arrives, your private chain is worthless. So dPoW does change the game theory to make selfish mining a lot riskier

[14-Dec-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I would think most everybody (other than selfish miners) would consider this an improvement

[14-Dec-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
different does not mean worse

[14-Dec-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes different means better

so far I see you repeating that "game theory is changed" making it sound like something is wrong, but let us give you the benefit of doubt

[14-Dec-18 09:57 AM] lord kek#0511
no no, I was saying the game theory has changed, not claiming it is better or worse.

[14-Dec-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that miners dont have incentive to keep mining the longest chain after a notarization i guess means they are free to switch to a different chain to mine. maybe if constant reorgs were an issue, they wouldnt do that

[14-Dec-18 09:58 AM] lord kek#0511
I was just curious how it has changed and whats your take on it

[14-Dec-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but even if that were the case it can be viewed as an infinite amount of hashrate is mining the notarized chain, as no amount of hash power can overwrite it

[14-Dec-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW changes the game theory in ways that make selfish mining a lot riskier, other changes likely are very small effects on the practical reality
