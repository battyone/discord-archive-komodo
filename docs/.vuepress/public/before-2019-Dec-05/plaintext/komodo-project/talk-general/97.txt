just put high entropy data into it to get the throughput established

[14-Oct-18 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
everyone can stop mining and chat continues to work

[14-Oct-18 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
then it is a matter to have capture/display of the rawdata

[14-Oct-18 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe would have different formats supported, but the key is how much bandwidth is possible

[14-Oct-18 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine a low res video wont be any trouble at all

[14-Oct-18 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
we're having some pretty interesting convos on STAKEDB1 if anyone wants to join üòâ

[14-Oct-18 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i knew the chat chain would have some cool usecase

[14-Oct-18 03:34 AM] Alright#0419

For anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about, KMD asset chains now support real time on-chain chat rooms

[14-Oct-18 03:36 AM] Alright#0419
immutable chat rooms if it's dpow'd

[14-Oct-18 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure you add a sequence number as with more nodes you can get the transactions out of order

[14-Oct-18 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
speaking of legal things, immutable chat might be useful for legal testimony

You're in the right place @Geocold51 the average person here understands 51% attacks

[14-Oct-18 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
and much more

[14-Oct-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the TROLL chain I made is what your saying to use @jl777c  
Alright didnt use that chain for his oracles chat dApp that chain is still alive tough if we want to test things on it.

[14-Oct-18 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
oracles chat dapp is compatible with any asset chain

[14-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
Can have a specific STAKED branch that does that

[14-Oct-18 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the dapp would have the codecs. each opreturn would have streamid/seqid. for playback it would need to buffer enough to make sure it has all the required seqid

[14-Oct-18 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt seem like any big problems

[14-Oct-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
*wishes I could star messages like I did on slack*

[14-Oct-18 04:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How about a discord like blockchain?

[14-Oct-18 04:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
voice would require a lot less bandwidth (from what I understand)

[14-Oct-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
We can do chat rooms easily

[14-Oct-18 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
I will work on pictures at first and maybe move on to other data

Also

[14-Oct-18 04:30 AM] Geocold51#6462
@Hollowman9000 Why'd you pay me to come here?

[14-Oct-18 04:30 AM] Alright#0419
ask your lawyer

[14-Oct-18 04:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Probably because he thought you would be interested in real blockchain development

[14-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
Yea sorry for being a dick, if you want to *actually learn* about how blockchains work this is *the* place to do it

[14-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Geocold51#6462
Sure. I get that

[14-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Geocold51#6462
But i'm still a lil confused by it all

[14-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Geocold51#6462
Why'd he offer ARRR

[14-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Geocold51#6462
Why'd he pay?

[14-Oct-18 04:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
ARRR is a completely private chain,  probably thought it would be more fitting.   He paid because he wanted to

[14-Oct-18 04:33 AM] Alright#0419
you (unknowingly) challenged dpow by saying you would double spend on EMC2

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
Nope

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I didn't

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
so you have been quite an interest here since

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I said I could not

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I said it wouldn't work against EMC2

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I said that in 5 places maybe

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
I was going to show BTCP, a coin that has no mitigatiosn

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
and EMC2

[14-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Geocold51#6462
a coin with mitigations

[14-Oct-18 04:35 AM] Geocold51#6462
The message being

[14-Oct-18 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
I think he realizes you are competent and wants you to be part of the community

[14-Oct-18 04:35 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 04:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Geo, you're helping out the Komodo Ecosystem (and every coin without huge amounts of hash/dPoW) by proving a point.

[14-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Geocold51#6462
That's the goal

[14-Oct-18 04:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
People in this community share that same thought. Which is why I see he invited you here

[14-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Geocold51#6462
Gotcha

[14-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Geocold51#6462
Because

[14-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Geocold51#6462
it was a funny offer

[14-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Geocold51#6462
"You just have to download this coin and wait for the entire blockchain to sync"

[14-Oct-18 04:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
it's only available as full node right now ,  being all z addresses

[14-Oct-18 04:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You'd have to ask him personally if there were any other motivations behind him paying you. I am just airing my thoughts.

[14-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
Ya, he paid me a lot too

[14-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
When he first PMed me I had assumed ARRR was super cheap

[14-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Geocold51#6462
I didn't rly care about money tho so I was down to join either way

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
But then I googled it

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
ARRR is some serious shit, first forced zkSNARKs blockchain

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
serious contender in privacy coins

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
Hm

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
interesting

[14-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Geocold51#6462
I do think privacy focused currency is the one thing for which blockchains is a good solution

[14-Oct-18 04:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The only t-transactions are from mining addresses to zaddr, and notarising transactions

[14-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Geocold51#6462
It sounds cool

[14-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Geocold51#6462
Shit, maybe I should have taken some ARRR

[14-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Alright#0419

[14-Oct-18 04:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I wanna say the entire blockchain is about 10mb

[14-Oct-18 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
do you have zcash or KMD synced?

[14-Oct-18 04:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
10mb is an exaggeration but it's small

[14-Oct-18 04:44 AM] Alright#0419
