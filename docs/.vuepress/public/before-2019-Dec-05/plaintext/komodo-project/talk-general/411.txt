[23-Aug-19 06:00 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah probably

[23-Aug-19 06:01 AM] Slyris#2880
But for example draeth can print for himself and use it as goldbar I believe

[23-Aug-19 06:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Lot of people do that

[23-Aug-19 06:01 AM] Draeth#3300
The only way to put a private key in a coin in my opinion is to engrave it yourself

{Reactions}
👆 

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Slyris#2880
That why people was using steel

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Slyris#2880
If I remember

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Steel box with key that they can engrave on it

[23-Aug-19 06:02 AM] Draeth#3300
Ah gotcha

[23-Aug-19 06:03 AM] Draeth#3300
That makes sense

[23-Aug-19 06:03 AM] Slyris#2880
This kind of things but coinlike

[23-Aug-19 06:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Can be cool

[23-Aug-19 06:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Because cryptosteel is hugly as fk

[23-Aug-19 06:04 AM] Slyris#2880
So yes someone can buy a cryptosteel + your coin

[23-Aug-19 06:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Coin have the public key cryptosteel the private for example

[23-Aug-19 06:07 AM] Draeth#3300
I don't know about you,  but this comforts me knowing a nuke being detonated nearby wont wipe my private key lol

[23-Aug-19 06:08 AM] Draeth#3300
But yea, that's a cool idea  @Slyris

[23-Aug-19 06:10 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
If nukes don't wipe out all the systems running the blockchain, this is the way to recover your coins. The question is: will they be worth anything after such a cataclysmic event?

[23-Aug-19 06:11 AM] Draeth#3300
I think I'd be more concerned about the nukes going off lol

[23-Aug-19 06:11 AM] Draeth#3300
If the chain is still going, it'll always have value

[23-Aug-19 06:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Ahahahah

[23-Aug-19 06:13 AM] Slyris#2880
There is probably some coins holder in country like syria

[23-Aug-19 06:13 AM] Slyris#2880
That make sense

[23-Aug-19 06:14 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
After an EMP you'll probably be living in a 'society' without electronic infrastructure... Gonna be hard accessing the chain!

[23-Aug-19 06:14 AM] Draeth#3300
The closest to Syria I've shipped coins to is Turkey

[23-Aug-19 06:16 AM] Draeth#3300
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 yea, but there will always be a way, it'll just be more difficult

[23-Aug-19 06:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Anyway a physical coin that represents a fixed value can be a good idea

[23-Aug-19 06:17 AM] Slyris#2880
A gold bar is a gold bar

[23-Aug-19 06:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Don't matter what

[23-Aug-19 06:18 AM] Slyris#2880
On fact someone can have a cryptosteel representing 100 btc for example but idk I don't like it's hugly

[23-Aug-19 06:18 AM] Draeth#3300
Lol we got wayyyy off topic

[23-Aug-19 06:18 AM] Slyris#2880
May be a solution is kind of goldbar representing a coin it's bigger so you can grave on it

[23-Aug-19 06:19 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah anyway I buy my kmd physical coin

[23-Aug-19 06:19 AM] Slyris#2880
Really beautiful

[23-Aug-19 06:19 AM] Draeth#3300
Yea I saw

[23-Aug-19 06:19 AM] Draeth#3300
They look amazing in person

[23-Aug-19 06:19 AM] Draeth#3300
I was really happy when I got the shipment in

[23-Aug-19 06:21 AM] Draeth#3300
I'll have your order shipped out in about 12 hours (it's almost 230am by me, so late afternoon ish)

[23-Aug-19 06:24 AM] Draeth#3300
I'll catch you all later,  I'm gonna get some sleep.   @Slyris I'll let you know when I ship it

Can pirate be used for anonymous chats (somehow)? There doesn't seem to be any great anon chat services. Signal wants a phone number.. dumb.

libnspv html wallet is now localizable into different languages. we just need a file in the same format at ~/libnspv/html/languages/english.json
we need at least the following languages: french, italian, chinese, chinese simplified, japanese, korean, russian and spanish.
those are the languages with seed words. however, the html can support basically any language, just need the language.json file

Hey guys! 

I just want to say that you're all wild. I've never met a better community in the crypto space, and I'm super thankful that I had a chance encounter with @Bitcoin Benny almost a year ago. He said only the best things about Komodo, and I can certainly see why. I've never seen such a consistently innovative group with the drive to share knowledge. It's amazing, and as I develop some of the projects I'm working on, I will always make sure that any future successes I have in this space wouldn't be possible without you. All of the team, and the community at large is an inspiration. Thanks for being incredible!
