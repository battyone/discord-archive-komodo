[21-Jun-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
there is M2 and M3 for money supply things

[21-Jun-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and what about debt markets, equity markets, real estate

[21-Jun-19 07:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is M2 and M3 ?

[21-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
yeah my vision is that crypto will absorb all the world debt

i read somewhere in the past that if bitcoin absorbs every dollar (that is known) to be in circulation

[21-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
btc would be 200 mil

[21-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Tek#5253
worth 200 mil dolla

[21-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Tek#5253
could also be all fiat / debt

@damon just ask him yourself at #ask-jl777 . they setup a donation address and I think he put up over 1 M KMD.

:sigh: this is going to get bad rep to opensource

[22-Jun-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you think it is limited to open source?

[22-Jun-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it is all this automated build pipelines that many believe is some requirement that makes this such a big issue

[22-Jun-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and a lot of closed source has the automated build pipelines

[22-Jun-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and it creates a "damned if you do, damned if you dont" situation, as when a new update is announced to fix a security problem, how many are deeply reviewing it?

[22-Jun-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you rebuild with the updated version, maybe you block the zeroday attack, or maybe you include some malware into the project

[22-Jun-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i predict it wont be long before we get something that does both

[22-Jun-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you dont update, you are subject to the zeroday which is exploited at the user level, spam with enough clickbait to a malicious site to trigger the malware

[22-Jun-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do update, you build in the malware

[22-Jun-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
alternative is to review every single update in detail, which will slow down the development process by a significant amount of time

[22-Jun-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
only projects that write on top of very low level services with minimal external dependencies will be able to proceed without too much slowdown

[22-Jun-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it will indeed be a different world moving forward

[22-Jun-19 03:10 PM] PTYX#6840
Hacks will escalate surely with more money and more projects involved

[22-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Hermes#6934
interesting to read this

[22-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Hermes#6934
even if one builds an app from zero ...with no open source libraries from scratch this could happen right? Unless you build it in a new programming language that nobody else has used but that's impossible because it won't be able to run in any normal PC.

[22-Jun-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on the language, something that is built into the os like C, that has minimal external dependencies should be pretty safe

[22-Jun-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
some of the new languages that autoupdate themselves all the time, not so much

[22-Jun-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the hackers have to find just a single weakness, either technical or social

[22-Jun-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i am strongly considering going back to iguana, which is an almost fully self contained crypto codebase

[22-Jun-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
since i wrote all of it from scratch, no worries of externally injected things

[22-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Hermes#6934
yeah I was thinking the same way...in this open source space the word "MONEY" and open source are not mixing well when the word "AutoUPDATE" and "GrandmaUSER" Exist

[22-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Hermes#6934
not only open source but also closed code that uses open source libraries

[22-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Hermes#6934
alright well at least there will be more money for programmers to make

if you only rely on libs that are shipped with the OS, you are pretty safe, since it is pretty hard to inject malicious code there
and there are a lot of libs and stuff shipped, so i don't think you will miss any functionality: https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages

[22-Jun-19 03:50 PM] PTYX#6840
@Hermes with most crypto apps you are dealing with multiple attack vectors. On the client and server side

[22-Jun-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and user side

[22-Jun-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not to mention the occasional protocol level issues, though those are pretty rare in bitcoin protocol coins

[22-Jun-19 03:53 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah. Scary stuff.

[22-Jun-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
basically dont put all your coins in one "place"

distribute it out N ways, where N depends on how sad you would get if 1/N is lost

[22-Jun-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and the amount of work it is to maintain N different "places"

Very true. We're currently designing 2 extra screens for Chameleon to stress the use of hardware wallets for substantial amounts. Hot wallets need to be thought of as spending wallets. Not longterm storage.
