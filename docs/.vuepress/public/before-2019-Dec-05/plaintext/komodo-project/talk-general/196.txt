@Decker  I'm just trolling 😛

[03-Feb-19 01:15 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but I see you ike puzzles a lot 😃

[03-Feb-19 01:17 PM] Decker#3767
I just like games at weekends ) Puzzles are better than NFS and Doom )

[03-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Decker#3767
So, about this puzzle i think it some count of dots depended, not words. Bcz if we need to just take "left word" before each dot - there is too many words. And don't clear what we should count as a word, for example in this example `(Head of Security).` ... so, i bet, it's numbers dependent. But here is also a lot of ambiguities ... we can count `.` between `...`, we can count `.` in each paragraph, as @Gawain  guessed, we can count `.` same in paragraphs including / excluding questions itself ... Or ... we can count length of each word before `.` ... 😂  So ... many thing around these `.` that we can count )))

[03-Feb-19 01:28 PM] shubham#7381
Can we have fifth hint plz

[03-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Decker#3767

Jesus, man, if you got some spare time I can get some work for you 😛

[03-Feb-19 01:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im curious how much time it takes for you to code such solution 5-10 min ? much less ?

[03-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Decker#3767
It's just a two loops ) How much time we need to write to `for` statements? I think, 60 seconds )

well write, test if assumptions correct... your skills about 5-10x my skills 😃

[03-Feb-19 01:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
php I guess

[03-Feb-19 01:43 PM] Decker#3767
yep, it's php ... in some cases i prefer it for easy work with arrays, etc.

[03-Feb-19 01:53 PM] Decker#3767
And about "to the left" ... it can be last symbol of each word before `.` ... but i'm also tried it yesterday `yyscyossdnys7olssemeddlnshnkelsssknmgsderner` )

It is number

[03-Feb-19 01:59 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
What is mean "you have to walk to the very end"

[03-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Decker#3767
Press Ctrl-End ))

[03-Feb-19 02:01 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Very end means maybe last of the sentence where we place dot

[03-Feb-19 02:10 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Too many dots if you count words too

[03-Feb-19 02:16 PM] ca333#0118
@Decker you almost had it!

[03-Feb-19 02:19 PM] ca333#0118
will add another 77.7 KMD to the interview-puzzle if its not solved within 1h [cc: @Blackbeard ]

[03-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Decker#3767
better to add another hint )

[03-Feb-19 02:23 PM] Decker#3767
i'm already tried even such exotic variants like `15\n27\n2` and `...\n15\n...\n27\n...\2` )

[03-Feb-19 02:23 PM] ca333#0118
i mean you really kinda solved it. you just missed some rules:
a) ONLY the interview text. (The last part:"Thank you for your time....." - is that still interview part? no)
b) you almost had it solved. just forgot something and added something not wanted according to a)

Give up )))

[03-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Decker#3767
I'm pretty sure that adding something in front of 1527 will give correct solution )

[03-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Decker#3767
But ... have no idea )

[03-Feb-19 03:08 PM] Decker#3767
"to the left" can mean right-to-left ... so, it can be reverse order ... 2715<something> )

[03-Feb-19 03:22 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
words like "with" dots should be counted?

[03-Feb-19 03:23 PM] Decker#3767

[03-Feb-19 03:30 PM] Nilla082#6002

[03-Feb-19 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326

[03-Feb-19 03:31 PM] Lokom#2178

but hasnt it been an hour and more coins were supposed to be sent over? 😃

[03-Feb-19 03:33 PM] shubham#7381
Now puzzle seems to be easy...

[03-Feb-19 03:33 PM] ca333#0118
@Nilla082 in this case its floating into the next puzzle. 😃

sweet. yea i came across this one last night and tried a few things

[03-Feb-19 03:34 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
common guys . you should give hints in twitter too. it is not fair chat with together and solve it

[03-Feb-19 03:35 PM] ca333#0118
@shubham ok - i will make 1-2 other easy puzzles with 7.77 KMD on them.

[03-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Decker#3767
@ca333 incorrect solution ... word `fuel”` has `”` symbol at the end ... it's not a `"` ...

[03-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Decker#3767
in text is `”` ...

[03-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Decker#3767
but in answer `"` ...

@Decker That got me too

[03-Feb-19 03:36 PM] ca333#0118
correct solution anyway. you should have tried both.

[03-Feb-19 03:36 PM] ca333#0118
its a puzzle after all - can expect little bit of trial/error. 😃
