Thank you for your support @Mister.G really appreciate it

[10-Dec-18 02:24 PM] Mister.G#3159
someone dumped 367k GXE?

[10-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes on the Mercatox

[10-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's look like bots certainly

[10-Dec-18 02:26 PM] Ludom#5832
The GXE are freely traded on Marcatox

[10-Dec-18 02:26 PM] jorian#4555
bots

[10-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Mister.G#3159
Is there solid evidence it is bots or is this just speculation?

[10-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Ludom#5832
It's speculation

[10-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Ludom#5832
I have no proof

[10-Dec-18 02:27 PM] Ludom#5832
But anyway from my part

[10-Dec-18 02:28 PM] forkhembo#0969
What I saw in the previous months is that bots (or people) made some trading because of the low liquidity and the spread (between buy and sell orders) on Mercatox

[10-Dec-18 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
We didn't prehype the announcement

[10-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Ludom#5832
And few try to take profit on it, it's very common in crypto

[10-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Ludom#5832
But we don't propose to invest but to help to finance development of banking service in the Komodo ecosystem

the way we see it is that Komodo platform is, as we said in the komodo proof of barbecue in Neuchatel, a network that fit our vision of what should be a decentralize financial services provider while complete.

[10-Dec-18 04:16 PM] FabØ#8941
I explain myself

[10-Dec-18 04:18 PM] FabØ#8941
I  am talking about an asset chain that allow transparency and fast transactions, scalable and that  support, day to day micro payment and also assets transfer, debt and equity

[10-Dec-18 04:19 PM] FabØ#8941
that all validated by external third parties such the notary nodes in the Komodo platform

[10-Dec-18 04:20 PM] FabØ#8941
- for the debt related assets the current system is perfect, fixed supply, fees are paid to notaries in the traded assets, op return allow to colour the token with the Hash of the credit documentation (transparency).

[10-Dec-18 04:20 PM] FabØ#8941
- for equity assets, we will need to find a diff set up, fee should be paid in KMD

[10-Dec-18 04:21 PM] FabØ#8941
now we all play btw each other and are representing roughly 2% of the world wide market

[10-Dec-18 04:22 PM] FabØ#8941
and close to nothing in terms of M1

[10-Dec-18 04:22 PM] FabØ#8941
and literally nothing in terms of M2

[10-Dec-18 04:23 PM] FabØ#8941
the challenge for all of us is for the next coming semesters to drive Mr and Mrs Martin to use our services without knowing anything about blockchain

[10-Dec-18 04:25 PM] FabØ#8941
proposing a set up that allow Ms Martin to sent use our beloved card and wire capability while able to sent money to her student son in the US in less than a minute is what we think can drive adoption

just want a fast going services that could be use with ease. Banking is the nightmare especially in Europe. Your banker is entitle to be a control freak most of the time and almost have to beg him to be able to use the limit on your card or being able to receive and sent money. Having to go at the branch to sign a paper to sent a international wire that will take 4 to 5days if everything goes smoothly

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] FabØ#8941

This night and possible tomorrow morning i will update all our KMD and assetchains explorers. So, plz don't report if you will see "502", it means - maintenance.
Update will be going "step-by-step", one chain after another, so no massive explorers outage planned.

[10-Dec-18 08:45 PM] plazma#1625
plz help...i was so engaged with studying crypto...i forgot about my software engineering exam....

[10-Dec-18 08:46 PM] plazma#1625
Question.    Suppose an organic software product for a business application costs $50,000 and its size is 40 KLOC. Determine the effort required to develop the software product at nominal development time. Assuming that the inhouse engineer cost $6000p/m, would it be more cost effective to buy this product or build it?

Solution.    cost of pre built software = $50,000
            
            Estimation of development effort
            
            Effort = 2.4 * (KLOC)^1.05 PM
                   
                   = 2.4 * (40)^1.05 PM
                   
                   = 2.4 * 48 PM
                   
                   = 115 PM
            
            Estimation of development time
            
            Nominal development time = 2.5 * (Effort)^0.38 Months
            
                                     = 2.5 * (115)^0.38 Months
                                     
                                     = 2.5 * 6 Months
                                     
                                     = 15 Months
            
            Cost required to develop the product = 15 * $6000
                                                 
                                                 = $90,000
            
            Conclusion
            
            Buy the damn software, or pay $40,000 extra....lol...:p(just joking in exam i won't write this conclusion....)

[10-Dec-18 08:46 PM] plazma#1625
is this correct...plz give review....

[10-Dec-18 08:48 PM] plazma#1625
any one having knowledge about organic software in COCOMO

[10-Dec-18 08:49 PM] plazma#1625
in exam i will write buying the software is more cost-effective then building it....

[10-Dec-18 09:02 PM] jorian#4555
this is the wrong channel?

[10-Dec-18 09:04 PM] plazma#1625
@jorian i know...a bit of urgency.....

can u plz...help....

[10-Dec-18 09:10 PM] plazma#1625
@webworker01 can u plz explain more...is it wrong....

[10-Dec-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`vs waiting for development + debugging as well as ongoing maintenance`
👆🏽 every reason there are a gajillion people using nomp, unomp, and znomp (not that they are actually ideal solutions)

[10-Dec-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and they're free

[10-Dec-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but people would still pay for them rather than a custom solution

[10-Dec-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
99% of every solution I ever created had more hrs spent on debugging than the actual code/base

[10-Dec-18 09:15 PM] plazma#1625
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is it wrong is so whats the correct answer....

[10-Dec-18 09:15 PM] plazma#1625
@webworker01 then whats the correct answer....

[10-Dec-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the correct answer is "there is insufficient data to calculate a 'correct' answer; because, we live in the real world and not some imaginary world where apps always work"

[10-Dec-18 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Determine the effort required to develop the software product at nominal development time.`
The level of assumptiveness in that alone is silly and why I dropped out

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch that and *i* being an imaginary number that only has one "correct" value are every reason I left uni

[10-Dec-18 09:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
i got stubborn and finished... waste of time & money, but hey i have a nice lil paper hanging over the toilet 😂

[10-Dec-18 10:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll always remember my systems architecture classes... i went in with hopes of learning about chipsets and transistors and how things work on a pcb and the feker was holding lectures on printers, mice, tube monitors and how to operate a pc with only a keyboard 🤦

[10-Dec-18 10:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
or advanced programming techniques ... html & css 😂

[10-Dec-18 10:02 PM] mrlynch#5735

Hi guys, have not been online for a while.. Question; where is any Supernet related updates or info? I still have a substantial amount of Unity and are wondering whether they will become listed again sometime and/or whether dividend in KMD are still envisaged? I see the NAV website is down?

[10-Dec-18 10:03 PM] Tommyhurley#3419

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  you were mentioning something the other day about python for a pool

[10-Dec-18 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the original stratum reference implementation was written in py

[10-Dec-18 10:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
d'you have that link handy? i'm looking at setting up a pool for pirate after sapling and python is my poison so thought i'd look into that

[10-Dec-18 10:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've successfully dodged js so far and i'd like to keep the streak :_))

[10-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Tommyhurley#3419
But I see no communication for the UNITY's. Where's the NAV? Is liquidity or dividends still in the cards?

[10-Dec-18 10:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@Tommyhurley there has been a pretty severe bear market, i wouldnt expect revshares anytime soon

[10-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Smedley#8094
Alright thanks for the help it does not appear to be possible in insight so I guess ill just give the original supply when filling form for coinpaprika

[10-Dec-18 10:21 PM] Tommyhurley#3419
I noticed.. I am now going through the rather painful excercise of clearing out all my exchange accounts, ICO funds i left, parity wallets etc etc. I remembered the (thousands..) of UNITY's left from back in the day. But good to know. Anyway thanks for all the hard work and we'll see if those assets come back to life some day.
