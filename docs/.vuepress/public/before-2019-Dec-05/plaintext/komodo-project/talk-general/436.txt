might be a better way then waiting other coins just come

[01-Oct-19 07:15 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
dPOW advante is mostly to CEXes (easy to secure and conf>=2 is enough, no need to think and change it in time or when hashrate change) also users - get faster confs, which is good user expeirence

[01-Oct-19 07:16 PM] Oszy#5734
many doesn't even know if a coin is dpow and sets up 120 confs

[01-Oct-19 07:17 PM] Markus#5464
Issue is not many want to pay i think, for example i have seen in the atomicdex channel that service providers have encountered teams that do not want to pay to get listed on atomicdex even.

[01-Oct-19 07:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe many exchanges could put pressure on slow hashrate coins, as it's their best interest... and dpow is way cheaper then even listing on most exchanges

[01-Oct-19 07:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
dPOW cost << listing cost

[01-Oct-19 07:17 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"many dont want to pay" is not valid argument

[01-Oct-19 07:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
when it happens = KMD moon

[01-Oct-19 07:19 PM] Markus#5464
Well security should be a must have if the coins team are being serious about the project, u cant stay unprotected and become successful and pretend u wont get attacked, cause u will

[01-Oct-19 07:19 PM] Markus#5464
ETC great example, high marketcap and got attacked

[01-Oct-19 07:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you pick coin team you pick wrong sales group as we currently see they are not interested - correct group is CEXes, they have interest to put pressure toward that solution

[01-Oct-19 07:20 PM] Instel7#1416
@Markus I feel most of the projects are overlooking security or in some way take it for granted

[01-Oct-19 07:21 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe if exchanges would understand how it works they could even covert first year fo dPOW, since listing fees usually >=3BTC

[01-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Markus#5464
Then the exchange is forced to support and help Komodo, do they really want that with atomicdex being a potential big threat?

[01-Oct-19 07:22 PM] Oszy#5734
Someone explain then why binance still has 120 conf for KMD 😕

[01-Oct-19 07:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
atomic dex is no threat, many solutions may coexist

[01-Oct-19 07:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I hear atomic dex will destroy CEXes for at least 2 years already 😂

[01-Oct-19 07:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at best it will give alternative for those who needs it

[01-Oct-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
Well it wont destroy CEXes as long as ppl dont realise the benefits of having control of ur own priv keys

[01-Oct-19 07:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
did BMW destroyed Ford ?

[01-Oct-19 07:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it is even possible CEXes will benefit atomic DEX - at it supports liquidity which may flow to and back from CEXes - win-win situation possible

[01-Oct-19 07:26 PM] Markus#5464
I dont think the intention is to destroy anything, same goes for car companies...they just want as big piece of the cake as possible

[01-Oct-19 07:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
atomic dex is same threat to CEXes as KMD is to BTC

[01-Oct-19 07:27 PM] Markus#5464
So with threat i meant atomicdex possibly taking a larger market share

[01-Oct-19 07:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not gonna happen, the exact same rules you belief that should take the big share probably should work for KMD getting bigger share of BTC cap, but its not working

[01-Oct-19 07:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so wrong asumptions

[01-Oct-19 07:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at least for now

[01-Oct-19 07:28 PM] Markus#5464
crypto space is not that big yet

[01-Oct-19 07:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
market is manipulated, and for now it does not seem more people will notice that and value projects that do not support that

[01-Oct-19 07:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I doubt atomic will fake volumes

[01-Oct-19 07:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but CEXes are doing that already

[01-Oct-19 07:29 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
same goes for many coin projects in top 100

[01-Oct-19 07:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this is the reason why it wont happen

[01-Oct-19 07:31 PM] Markus#5464
Well i agree that fake volume is a issue

yes, 1 minute. Higher TPS count can be achieved by linking more chains together into a network. Right now there's just one KMD chain.

Dudes! I have a small hitch building Komodo-ocean-Qt on my brand new Ubuntu 19.04:
'checking for exit in -lboost_system-mt...no
configure: error: Could not link against boost_system-mt ! '

However, on the same machine the latest pirate-qt-linux built just fine, so I guess tis is not a big thing
apitude says I have boost 1.65 and 1.67 - do you have a hint for me, @Decker @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ??

[04-Oct-19 06:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
there was similar stuff discussed on zcash issues some time back, but there are no conclusive answers- some say add some compiler directive - but no defintive resolution..

[04-Oct-19 06:52 AM] LocoMB#8593
boost has great potential for trouble - I would think for a greater adoption of Komodo such glitches should disappear eventually, or majority of users will just continue to use some Agama version

Are you using the `static` branch of <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean>?

[04-Oct-19 11:23 AM] LocoMB#8593
no maybe that is it- I just checked out the master branch as that is where the landing page points to, did git clone and then git checkout linux ...
I won't have time test this until next week, until then I'll be fine with the binary

[04-Oct-19 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OS specific builds are the old way, the static branch covers all 3 OSs and is up-to-date

[04-Oct-19 11:28 AM] LocoMB#8593
oh well I just started the build again - this time I  checked out the Linux-static branch and then did git checkout Linux-static .. see where that goes, will take a cpl hours .. in the README it says git checkout Linux, mabe that is a differtent one

Other than the `cd komodo` needing to be changed to `cd KomodoOcean`,

*you may need to change

  LIBZCASH_LIBS="-lgmp -lgmpxx -lboost_system -lcrypto -lsodium $RUST_LIBS"```
to
```elif test x$TARGET_OS != xwindows; then
  LIBZCASH_LIBS="-lgmp -lgmpxx -lboost_system-mt -lcrypto -lsodium $RUST_LIBS"```
in configure.ac if you get
`/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_system`

Seen few cases of DEX (decentralized exchanges) force KYC on their users past years, claiming they had no choice because regulators. It means someone in control can be pressured, which implies the DEX is fucking worthless.

Is there such a thing as a 'DEX'?

i think it's good because it supports fiat as well. also stocks

[08-Oct-19 07:45 AM] Lennart#9331
some assets are not "native", meaning you see them in your account but they are actually smart contracts tied to the assets real price

[08-Oct-19 07:46 AM] Lennart#9331
i know becuase i followed DGB getting on Abra, at first not native (could not withdraw DGB) but then they supported it native

[08-Oct-19 07:46 AM] Lennart#9331
Abra for sure a good onramp and also a tool for instant exchange into fiat for shop owners or else
