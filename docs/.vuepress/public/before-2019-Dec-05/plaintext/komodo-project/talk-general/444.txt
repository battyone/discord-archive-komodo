[31-Oct-19 06:50 PM] gigamesh#3544
seems like less swaps happened during this 6hr period than a usual 6hr period

[31-Oct-19 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`were there more than 1000 swaps
500?`
272 successful, according to <https://oracle.earth/mm2_stresstest_combined_leaderboard/>

[31-Oct-19 06:51 PM] gigamesh#3544
that's less than usual right?

[31-Oct-19 06:51 PM] gigamesh#3544
presumably the system can handle at least 1 swap every 5 secs?

[31-Oct-19 06:51 PM] dan.#2473
people are still swapping and its still counting i think

[31-Oct-19 06:51 PM] gigamesh#3544
272 in 360 minutes?

[31-Oct-19 06:52 PM] gigamesh#3544
feels like we all tripped over eachother

[31-Oct-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
I think what matter is that the team got a overview of what needs to be fixed to improve stability and scalability of the marketmaker until next stress test gets announced to see if the fixes changed anything

[31-Oct-19 06:52 PM] gigamesh#3544
sure but i still find these results surprising

[31-Oct-19 06:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what is bottleneck? decentralized order matching ?

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I think what matter is that the team got a overview of what needs to be fixed to improve stability and scalability`
At 1 successful swap every 1.3 minutes across the entire network, I'd say a whole lot needs fixing

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] gigamesh#3544
assuming those numbers r accurate

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] dan.#2473
a maker node on a dex will never be able to handle what just happened. i dont know why there wasnt a flow in place to handle this though. I.e. like a busy phone signal (do those exist anymore?)

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] gigamesh#3544
> what is bottleneck? decentralized order matching ?

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] gigamesh#3544
i think so

[31-Oct-19 06:54 PM] gigamesh#3544
i feel i was filling non-existent order

[31-Oct-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
first mm1 stress test was similar

[31-Oct-19 06:55 PM] dan.#2473
are orderbooks centralized now?

[31-Oct-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[31-Oct-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 just needs to optimize the network layer. first time a single orderbook had 1000 offers

[31-Oct-19 06:56 PM] dan.#2473
what part was breaking

[31-Oct-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
currently it works just fine, until it doesnt (when under heavy load)

[31-Oct-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
not 100% sure yet, lets wait for the analysis, i heard about a lot of dropped connections

[31-Oct-19 06:57 PM] dan.#2473
were the relay nodes not handling all the connections or, did some of the code not account for that many p2p connections

[31-Oct-19 06:57 PM] dan.#2473
alright

[31-Oct-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is too many connections, too much data, unoptimized network layer. like having hundreds of people trying to use the same door at the same time, usually ends up much worse than normal conditions

leaderboard stats are incomplete due to some swap data not being recieved. Once it arrives I'll update the numbers.

each swap data json has timestamps so we can get an accurate picture

[31-Oct-19 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
My completed swaps show

[31-Oct-19 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Only the 2/3 one not, but whatever

[31-Oct-19 07:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah wait it shows timed out now! Maybe a suggestion to show where it timed out? Now it shows timed out 0/3, but was 2/3?

[31-Oct-19 09:33 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i made a new swap few minutes ago and it completed fine

[31-Oct-19 09:37 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
the stress test is over so it should work normal now

[31-Oct-19 09:38 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

@Tort I haven't seen any announcement about a GM position being open yet. If Komodo did hire someone, it would need to be someone that moved the needle and made a huge difference. It will probably take time to find the right person.

Puh - central exchanges is such a competetive space.  But a few weeks ago i read a good article ..... DEX'es  will rule in the long run because even instutional investors will look for self custody . So i guess we should be more focuse on the Dex space
