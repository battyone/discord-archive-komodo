i tried to make the process as easy as possible

[07-Jun-19 02:04 PM] miles#6381
@jl777c  i know you doing KMD first - but does the linkage of the two addresses via steps 1 / 2 work for other assets in the future or is that for later?

[07-Jun-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i will just use any existing linkage between compromised address and claim address

[07-Jun-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only need to file a separate claim if you have a non-KMD compromised address that wasnt compromised (or had funds) on KMD

[07-Jun-19 02:05 PM] joe201#9786
@miles thanks!

[07-Jun-19 02:07 PM] miles#6381
i had CHIPS and VRSC swept to the safe address and put a claim  for each - so all good then

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] techblack#0067
I See the google form changed. Do i need to refill it or is it ok to have it like it was in 5th?

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Keppie#5156
Don't resubmit @techblack

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes you can put in a claim for each coin, that will take precedence. if there is no claim, then KMD claim linkage will be used

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Keppie#5156
First claim is fine

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] gcharang#6833
@techblack no need to refill

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] techblack#0067
Ok thanks

if you have ANY address that had funds swept/stolen and did not get a special tx 1), please let me know ASAP

[07-Jun-19 02:17 PM] istante#3749
@jl777c ok ! Thanks !!!!

[07-Jun-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there seem to be the trolls out in social media saying that we shouldnt have swept the funds. i think it would be very helpful if people here who feel that what we did was the right thing, could post in social media, that will help set the record straight

[07-Jun-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if we didnt do what we did, there wouldnt be any claim process, complex or otherwise. just a lot of tears over 9 million KMD missing

[07-Jun-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
some trolls are claiming that we hacked the users based on what the news reports say, but really we hacked the hackers data trove

Hi, I have recieved 0.00020041 at old wallet, I have to send all to my new wallet or only 0.0001 ?

[07-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Keppie#5156
0.0001 or more, doesnt matter

[07-Jun-19 02:28 PM] puls4rr#1354

tbh dont think the amount matters, right @jl777c . As long as it was a succesful transaction

[07-Jun-19 02:29 PM] zaius333#5338
We appreciate you and your team's efforts @jl777c. It's clear to me that the right thing was done. Thank you.

[07-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I think  @Keppie is correct the amount doesn't matter. You need .0001 to make a KMD transaction. I screwed up In the moment and got scared that I didn't send enough, so I sent more. Hopefully I'm still OK and not in dispute üòÖ

I've seen some social media trolls aswell regarding the hack. If you happen to spot some, try explaining them what happened

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
any amount will do

[07-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and proactively making posts about how it is a good thing we did this, that will shift the tide

Which wallet could we use with our compromised seed to make the special tx?

[07-Jun-19 02:32 PM] gcharang#6833
Verus agama 0.6

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
I tried the Verus Agama but it doesn't work

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] gcharang#6833
version o.6?

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
nop

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
0.5.6

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
@gcharang Verus Agama 0.5.6a is also good, correct?

[07-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
It doesn't find server

[07-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Ludom#5832
But it does for Verus

if it works for you then fine
but 0.6 we have tested to connnect to KMD electrums consistently

[07-Jun-19 02:34 PM] LocoMB#8593

@LocoMB I used 0.5.6a also, but gave an error. Some coins didn't show up. 
V0.6.0.13 works fine. No problems.

tbh; I've just read 5-6 articles from today. None of them talk about how much the hacker got away with if any. They talk about a succesful hack, a needed hack to secure its users funds

[07-Jun-19 02:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
better they don't talk about that, because nobody really knows yet

[07-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Keppie#5156
For sure, I just mean that the articles i've read are postive articles

if it happened to a bitcoin wallet, the wallet devs could do something

[07-Jun-19 02:47 PM] TS#7923
a wallet hack vs a successful attack on the chain are not even in the same ballpark, exactly

@mazyar_lp if you used the KMD Agama wallet release, you should send your funds to an address created with a different wallet.

[07-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Verus Agama, Ocean, or Zelcore, or any other wallet.
