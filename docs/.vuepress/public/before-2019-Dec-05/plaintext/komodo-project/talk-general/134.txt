Hey guys! I live in the United States and I'm looking to move to a city where the cryptocurrency industry is booming. I'm interested in hopefully getting a sales/marketing job with any kind of crypto company. In your opinions, what cities in the USA are on the cutting edge of crypto adoption? If not in the USA, what other cities around the world are crypto-friendly? Thanks for any ideas you may have.

[19-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
the US is the least crypto friendly country in the world

"501 organization
A 501 organization is a nonprofit organization in the federal law of the United States according to and is one of 29 types of nonprofit organizations exempt from some federal income taxes. Sections 503 through 505 set out the requirements for attaining such exemptions."

Honestly if that is true it's a bit of a joke, The US is not the world.

[21-Nov-18 05:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The idea is to have multiple nonprofits eventually ,  one for every country , with a federation as an umbrella to them all.   These will function as an auxiliary to the current open source online community that we currently have.

ok then, I'm no expert but thanks for explaining that.

[21-Nov-18 05:45 AM] ch6ris#5240
I'm just a curious stakeholder. I can't exactly see how crypto could ever be classified as not for profit.

[21-Nov-18 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it isnt for profit exactly ... as the code is open source and you dont get paid ... its speculators who buy tokesn that give profit, not the actual work devs do.

[21-Nov-18 05:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency. --- From IRS exempt purposes ( I'm us based but it's similar in a lot of countries )

I saw an interesting interview with I htink it was some EOS dev, where he said, its all well and good creating tools to build a new system, howeverm heaps of the tools people are trying to build are horribly illegal under the existing system, and just workign on them could get you into lots of trouble.
