in regular business you do not do experimental coding

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is regular stuff moore easy to forsee - just need a talented people for that

[29-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
In some business u do ... like coding game engines ... and those companies also have deadlines

[29-Sep-18 08:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok in some businesses you do, but in many not, hence these expectations

[29-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I installed the DEX - it looks good

👌 

[29-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
so what at the main issues in its development right now ?

[29-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
what needs to be solved in order for this DEX to be 100% working ?

[29-Sep-18 08:29 PM] PTYX#6840
Marketmaker as far as I understand

[29-Sep-18 08:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, they're improving the mm, but it works, although not many are swapping

[29-Sep-18 08:30 PM] PTYX#6840
I've been unable to make a successful swap on Hyperdex for weeks. The order book often disappears due to loss of connection.

[29-Sep-18 08:30 PM] PTYX#6840
I've already brought it up with @hyperDEX. I've been told it's mm.

[29-Sep-18 08:30 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@PTYX thanks for sharing ur experience

[29-Sep-18 08:30 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so liquidity is needed and marketing could fix that

[29-Sep-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`In some business u do ... like coding game engines ... and those companies also have deadlines`
Yeah, and point me to a single one that's hit a deadline and didn't need 4 patches in the 1st 2 months....

[29-Sep-18 08:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can have it fast, or you can have it right

[29-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 at least they have deadline they try to strive towards to - answers like " it will be ready when it is ready" belong into the kindergarden

[29-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
It is not serious way to do business

[29-Sep-18 08:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"it will be ready when ready" belong to free people too 😃

@Hungry_BullBear You're more than welcome to jump on board, write the code and learn us how to graduate to 2nd grade....

[29-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
it looks more like a hobby than a real effort on something important when u say sh$t like that

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
well afaik no one pay JL

[29-Sep-18 08:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so kind of hobby

[29-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I actually know real world class programmers that work on real products that generate millions of USD . The programmer life style is something in I am very much not interested in

[29-Sep-18 08:35 PM] snowdamn#2414
my personal timeline is 5-10 years
i'll start worrying after that

[29-Sep-18 08:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Well I agree it's better to tell an ETA and not keep it then not tell at all sometimes, but it's just my opinion

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
So here is another question - Is SEGWIT a requirement in order to be able to swap/trade a token on HyperDEX .

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's just estimation

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
eta = Q4 2218
There, now you know and when it's done it will be early 🙂

[29-Sep-18 08:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's normal some things have delays big or small

[29-Sep-18 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hungry_BullBear Segwit is a requirement for exactly nothing on the planet

[29-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Thank u . U are really helpful and informative person 😃

[29-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
What is the limitation factor of what could be traded on HyperDEX ?

[29-Sep-18 08:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
can believe what I read 😃

[29-Sep-18 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You think I'm being a smartass about segwit, but it's honestly a fact 😣

[29-Sep-18 08:38 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U dont think u are smart at all .. nor do I think u are ass

[29-Sep-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nor do I think u are ass`
stick around a while, you'll learn better

what's that code thing that needs to be added again?

[29-Sep-18 08:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
for DEX listing

[29-Sep-18 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that code thing` 🤔

[29-Sep-18 08:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
to be compatible

[29-Sep-18 08:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
the guy asked, so worth answering

[29-Sep-18 08:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
repetition of info is good

You mean that 👆 ?

[29-Sep-18 08:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
awesome 👍

[29-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Does that mean that with that line of code any crypto can get "listed" on HyperDEx ?

[29-Sep-18 08:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, but need the other conditions as well

[29-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
"Bitcoin compatible" - what about coins that are not forks of BTC ?

[29-Sep-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` that line of code` = you didn't read the page

[29-Sep-18 08:47 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
The proposed coin must support the following API calls and must have BIP65 implemented.

[29-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
No idea how to check which coins can/do have such API calls ( whatever the hell is that)

[29-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
so in short only BTC forks can be traded , right ?

[29-Sep-18 08:48 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
ok

[29-Sep-18 08:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
and ERC20

[29-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
so how is that different from what Lightning Network is trying to do ?

[29-Sep-18 08:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
and if developers make their coins compatible

[29-Sep-18 08:50 PM] snowdamn#2414
i thought you were in a rush lol

[29-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
What is the difference ?

[29-Sep-18 08:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
there are no ERC20 on BarterDEX?

[29-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Cant u just do atomic swaps on the Lightn Network ?

[29-Sep-18 08:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes

[29-Sep-18 08:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
is LN working now?

[29-Sep-18 08:53 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I`m confused why are there two DEXs BarterDEX/HyperDEX

[29-Sep-18 08:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
Different GUI

[29-Sep-18 08:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Hungry_BullBear sell all your BTC, buy KMD 😀

[29-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
OK , I got somwhere in life cuz I do what random people tell me to do on the internet

[29-Sep-18 08:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, one second you're in a rush and then you talk about LN lol 😂

[29-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Who said I`m in a rush ? I only said I dont like to read terribly written technical literature on github

[29-Sep-18 08:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
read slower

[29-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
ok but I dont see the point in having 2 exchanges - can some1 explain that

[29-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
ok

[29-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I assume there are plans for CC DEX

[29-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
ok - thanks for all the info

[29-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I`m having a better idea of what KMD is now

[29-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
tell the programmers they should pay u guys @Deleted User @snowdamn

[29-Sep-18 08:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
nah, i'm good 😃

[29-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
what exactly is that  ?

[29-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
The thing that plugs KMD chain information in the other chains ?

[29-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
how does that work ?

[29-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
what do u need to do to set up notary node ?

[29-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I get that

what do u need to do to set up notary node ?

[29-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
can u give me a short answer - i dont want to read

[29-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I got server - what else do I need

[29-Sep-18 09:02 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and how much does it pay to be a node ?

[29-Sep-18 09:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
1800KMD a month more or less depending how good you manage your server

[29-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Who and how decides who gets on the 32 seats every year ?

[29-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
this does not answers my question actually

[29-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
what is the process ?

[29-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
How much u need to hold ?

[29-Sep-18 09:10 PM] DesignBlock#0184
Since Komodo is opensource, can i create another "Komodo" with new "KMD" then interoperate with these Komodo Assetchains?

[29-Sep-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How much u need to hold ?`
For every 1 KMD you hold you get one "vote coin" and you cast your vote(s) for who you choose to elect

[29-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
When is the voting done ?

[29-Sep-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In March iirc

[29-Sep-18 09:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
once a year next maybe in march 2019
results of last election are here dexstats.info/votelist.php if you want to see how many votes were needed

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[29-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
so ... U need about 1.25 mil KMD to get selected

[29-Sep-18 09:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, you need that many stakeholder votes

[29-Sep-18 09:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
that was last election about 40% of the votes were casted

[29-Sep-18 09:16 PM] CHMEX#0686
I can imagine if the price is the same as 2018 -> similar numbers
