Congrats to the whole team! Very good result! 👏

For the rest, love the rebranded logo & site. Excited for more

[16-Jul-19 06:04 AM] bogybogy#3962
The logo looks better (professional)is more aprochable from point of view from a enterprise,maybe few years ago was a game to be in crypto but now we deal with a financial change in our humanity and kmd needs to provide his prints in the market,after this rebranding we can say kmd will have own niche in the market, patience gents for a new chapter in our knowledge and change in the financial system

God, finally, that looks freaking sexy. Very well done Team Komodo.

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] Acura#2748
Once again Komodo delivered, first of all as it was often the case.

Atomic Swaps on a smartphone, completely decentralized, 
without limits, 
without Kyc, 
without geoblocking, 
without proxytokens, 
without middleman 
and without centralized gateways 🤙🏼💥🤙🏼

I like the logo tbh

[16-Jul-19 08:02 AM] barv#0867
The brand style is awesome. Well done. Logo is a bit mainstream, not very recognizable imho. On the other hand it wont offend anyone.

[16-Jul-19 08:08 AM] phideas#8309
New logo is simple, looks professional and it captures the essence of komodo: Ecosystem, interconnected blockchains, core technology. I like the rebrand. Worth the effort. Good brand should last for years without the need to redesign again.

[16-Jul-19 08:10 AM] barv#0867

That can be really great if vitalik knows about Komodo because what he describe it's already solved by the Komodo blockchain

[16-Jul-19 09:29 AM] house#8741
I’m sure he already does @Slyris ... the biscuit crumbs we leave will bring his people to find us

[16-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Slyris#2880
That can be incredible a collaboration between Komodo and ethereum to be honest

[16-Jul-19 09:55 AM] II#8427
Ethereum does not want to collaborate with anyone, 
you need to understand that all that conversation is 
at best a ruse to get folks to talk and then move on.

There's much better fits for what Ethereum needs 
than BCash, for example there's GoChain, specifically
solved all the issues that plague Ethereum so badly, 
Scalability, Speed, Fees, 100% ETH Compatibility to
enable any dApp or Smart Contract that runs on ETH
to run without modification on GoChain (GO). It even 
has full address compatibility, one just has to select a 
GoChain node to see Balances & Tokens one has on the
same address than one uses for ETH & Tokens. Go figure.
Why would Ethereum not choose a perfect fit for their own
intermediate shortcoming in their transition phase to whatever?

Said that, there's even some OG UTXO blockchains 
that are a much better fit to that purpose than BCash, 
for example FLO, a metadata & DLR validating specialised 
project with 100% data integrity  &  uptime since 2013, 
on PoW with 40 seconds block time. Caltech, t0 & Medici 
are building on FLO currently with working live use-cases.

Vitalik names BCH, which is not really a fit for other reasons.
Who knows what's in his bag? 🙄

Using  the GUI composer is this recommended for non-developers, how does it stay up to date, etc. Is it a clone of KMD?

[16-Jul-19 04:51 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Congratulation for the composer, I think the latest news from Komodo are amazing.
The only thing is that once you create a blockchain, it has everything you need...optional privacy, security...but how can dapps being built use it. Komodo doesn't seem to have the infrastructure that Ethereum has with Metamask etc 
Is something being worked on about that too?

[16-Jul-19 04:55 PM] RNI#2666
Wow! That rebrand is simply awesome! The new logo, the website...beautiful 😍
