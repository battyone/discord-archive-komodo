They also say ```Utilize pure Proof of Work mining until at least the second block reward halving, at which point 75% of all Ycash will have been mined via Proof of Work. (Full or partial Proof of Stake will not be implemented, if at all, until after the second block reward halving.)```

I don't see why the world needs another zcash with minor differences, any thoughts?

Why cash?

[11-Apr-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why cash?`
Because the Bitcoin whitepaper didn't start with the line:
`A purely non-peer-to-peer version of electronic commodity would allow online fortunes to be made indirectly from one party to another going through a centralized exchange institution. `?

Ok .. So how asset chain service providers approach businesses , what kind of businesses are approaching you? are they enterprise or they just want their own coin and do ICO?

[11-Apr-19 04:20 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Also just google "dpow" and then google "dpos" and see top 3 results  ... You will understand where we are lacking..

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap are you going to be the one to purchase as much ad power as that guy has?

[11-Apr-19 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap the majority are ico or sto requests

[11-Apr-19 04:39 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
It's not about that.. original content can also trend if put efforts in that direction .. we don't need ads ..we need education

[11-Apr-19 04:39 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
@PTYX how you guys do outreach?

[11-Apr-19 04:41 PM] PTYX#6840
Mostly through LinkedIn and Google ads.  Also targeted approaches to companies or projects that could use our services.

[11-Apr-19 04:42 PM] PTYX#6840
We don't have much to throw at marketing but I've found that a targeted approach works best. We've had success with selling assetchain, wallet integrations, whitelabel wallet service, and we had projects in line for barterdex.

@PTYX I think asset chain adoption is more sticking value proposition in long term ... Do you also outreach to enterprise..or do events or meetups?

Yes, we are now part of the chamber of technology of Panama

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I will prove it to you over time

[11-Apr-19 04:44 PM] PTYX#6840
We have to attend monthly meetings where we pitch to enterprise

[11-Apr-19 04:46 PM] PTYX#6840
However, most companies we've sat down with aren't really interested or don't understand it enough. Specially in Latin America. However, there are some advances happening in Colombia and Argentina with more companies adopting blockchain tech for Fintech or supply chain purposes

[11-Apr-19 04:46 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Are there any particular industry which is lean towards asset chain use cases??

[11-Apr-19 04:48 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I think komodo is more close to hyperledger in product proposition.. We can tail hyperledger market .. though we need a branding like that.. 

To make a asset chain or interact with them did we build some libraries?

[11-Apr-19 04:53 PM] PTYX#6840
some of the use cases that have been thrown around are about launching blockchain in order to store statistical data. Or for example there were talks about using a blockchain to keep track of all real estate data. Apparently there are many buildings without owners due to bad filing practices. Other use cases involve voting and financial applications but none of these have materialized yet.

they are independent projects (most are, anyway), many of whom don't even frequent the Komodo discord

[11-Apr-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i know of many chains in the development process and the ones that are being done by "proper businesses" tend to keep things secret till it is completed

[11-Apr-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also a lot of the komodo capabilities got magnified by CC recently and very few people know about it at this point

[11-Apr-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Does eth have a discord where you can connect with all of the "proper businesses" using eth as a platform? or even where they could give you 1/2 an answer to that question?

[11-Apr-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not to mention the dozens of -ac options to customize assetchains

[11-Apr-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there are half a dozen or so external coins using dPoW, but not sure they would be categorized as "proper business"

[11-Apr-19 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention those using ac params privately

[11-Apr-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap If you have talents in bringing in clients and businesses on this end, one could make a lucrative business in perpetuity by just getting ETH erc20 project to port over to KMD for a fee.

@jl777c  I don't have doubt about komodo tech.. I just trying to identify problems.. So we can work on that.. I don't want to compare komodo with anyone ..just want to see what we do .. where kind of market we should target.. how to increase adoption..what is komodo's offering to market....  my questions looks hostile in nature .. but I just want to help

[11-Apr-19 05:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Gas fees and scaling are two HUGE cost benefits already, notto mention the constant input from the KMD team.  

Try to get Vitalik to hell with an ERC20 launch and let me know how it goes 😜

If there is something that you feel can be improved , have at it,  komodo is a community based project,  basically all of us started by that method

As you spend more time here you’ll start to gain a better grasp on it all. 

Think ETH.  Are they marketing to big businesses or are sub-projects doing this?    You know the answer.    Treat Komodo in the same fashion but with ever expanding utility and options.

KMD is a platform and it provides all in one blockchain solution for businesses that want to utilize blockchain in their businesses. But to help identify whether a business need blockchain or not - is the job of the businesses. Probably the bottleneck is to identify and implement a more efficient solution using blockchain to current situation/problems. This is a new uncharted territory.  I think
