isnt it strange that komodos development keep rocking day by day but doesnt need insane amounts of funding meanwhile new projects spend even millions to develop 1 thing what is not even a big deal

[05-Apr-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and not only do they spend that insane amount, what they do generally doesn't work or even ever hit public beta

Good post @joe2x4

[05-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
IMO I Don’t think that big enterprise will ever use something like EOS or TRX, they will slowly go down when this space becomes more regulated

[05-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Plus they are centralized and have less security

[05-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986

what's up?

[06-Apr-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, technical skill is the most valuable thing for an NN
but when the tech part becomes easy, then it is the usage of excess funds that will likely sway voters like me
at scale, I view each NN as a decentralized (at least distributed 64 ways) source of funds for the ecosystem
so if a newcomer to the ecosystem can convince just a single NN that their idea is worth supporting, it gets supported and a chance to become real
the excess NN profits are thus designed to be a decentralization of ecosystem project management
this doesnt work so well at near the 50 cents price
at the $5+ price I think it can start having some real effect and at $50+, then it can be a very powerful 64 stroke engine
yes that is $4 mil per month for the ecosystem at the $50 price
and the logic is that any NN that manages to be in the elected position has earned the right to allocate those funds

[06-Apr-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
When considering how to vote, please try to think about which NN are first able to run a node capably and within that list, which ones are using any excess revenues in the way that helps the ecosystem the most. What helps the ecosystem the most, will help the KMD price the most, a lot more than 0.05% you might get back from kickbacks. Compared to the 5% you are getting anyway, it is just noise. However, if you support the NN who has the most impactful usage of the excess funds, that could boost the KMD price measurably. And if all 64 are all helping the ecosystem grow...

But this is just me. Nobody is forced to follow what I do as it is a decentralized system, this komodo ecosystem. so each person can vote how they feel is best, whether to gain some fraction percentage more personally or to help the ecosystem indirectly

[06-Apr-19 12:36 PM] yorklab#7270
This is why I voted for someone who put a portion of their funds back into the system last year, and how I will vote this year. As far as technical capability that would be a difficult one to asses, especially if they are new.

notary testnet. not all started at the same time so just because they are not at the top, doesnt mean they are at the top. however the ones at the top were the ones that got setup first and have been notarizing steadily

[06-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

50% on notary funds are going towards ecosystem projects.  
Pirate development includes functionality and growth that can be worked into KMD such as the payment processing planned, Kovri integration plans and more.
Last year I thought I wanted to run a node to make some sweet sweet KMD.   This year, I’m not taking a dime.  Lynch will be the benefactor of the 20% beer and rum costs.  

Very happy and excited to be a part of the system this year.  💪

@FishyGuts Dude, if Verus coin develops zSPV that will go down as the biggest innovation since Zk-Snarks and dPoW

[06-Apr-19 03:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I concur @BlackJesus 

We are also working on it as well.  When @miketout picks his head up from PBaaS we’re hopefully going to pow-wow and hammer it out, but @radix42 has some skills and she is looking at the zcash reference release trying to decipher it.   
Zcash might as well have just released a non-working product. 😜

Also I have a few leads on a distributed node setup to remove the trusted server factor from the equation providing more privacy/security/trustless-ness.
