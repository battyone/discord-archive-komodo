yes

[12-Jan-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but the coinimports dont work until they are notarized as they piggyback onto the notarization data, so it is automatic

[12-Jan-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want to volunteer to keep the roadmap updated, all will appreciate it

[12-Jan-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
also most all the projects are on github as they are developed. cant get much more transparent than that

[12-Jan-19 09:58 AM] garbonzo607#4659
So the scaling solution has around a 10 minute lag time or what?

[12-Jan-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
actually it needs 2 notarizations, so more like 20 minutes

[12-Jan-19 10:03 AM] garbonzo607#4659
You can get more transparent than Github. Enron was technically transparent, but they used clever tools to obfuscate. If people don't understand or receive bad second/third hand info, it's not really transparent. You would need to understand code to see what progress is actually being made. We need people intimately familiar with the project to estimate progress.

[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I think most of us understand it's only an estimate. Every production has delays, nothing is set in stone.

[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so you suggest we hire a fulltime person to translate github progress into roadmaps?

[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
our funding is very tight, we dont have a budget for a roadmap updater

[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and we are not obsfucating things in our github

[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I didn't say you were. üòâ

[12-Jan-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is open for all to see, including people that know how to code who are independent

[12-Jan-19 10:06 AM] garbonzo607#4659
It was the same for Enron.

[12-Jan-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so I claim it is transparent to those that are able to read code

[12-Jan-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
comparing our situation to enron is not correct

[12-Jan-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
on so many levels

[12-Jan-19 10:10 AM] garbonzo607#4659
It doesn't guarantee anything though. It's transparent to people who can read code, take the initiative to read the code, and have the perception to notice all irregularities, which one person can't do, so it will always require multiple people, the more the better. Am I saying I have a solution to this? No. But I am saying that just because code is on Github doesn't make it transparent in the way many think of transparency. The code is public, but not 100% transparent. Again, there's not much Komodo can do about that right now, it's a problem for another day.

[12-Jan-19 10:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I would say our scaling solution is fine... That's a single node and only 2 blockchains, and only from one chain to another. No tx inside each chain.

[12-Jan-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are blind, then nothing will be visible to you

[12-Jan-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
we are making code

[12-Jan-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that code is published, open source

[12-Jan-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in the context of code, which is the most relevant, it is transparent

[12-Jan-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
calling this the same as enron is really some sort of trolling

[12-Jan-19 10:14 AM] garbonzo607#4659
The fact that Komodo is on a tight budget is why marketing matters though. You don't want to spend money that doesn't have a good ROI, and of course, the state of the project will affect that, but if spending on marketing has a good enough ROI to justify its expenses, then obviously it's worth it to spend the money on marketing.

people can build via the makefiles

[12-Jan-19 10:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's used by other projects as well for security of all things, so that should say something about the codes veracity

[12-Jan-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is worth it for the investors, then let a fund raising happen for a roadmap maintainer

[12-Jan-19 10:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The code is generally bug free :trollface:

[12-Jan-19 10:15 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I'm not accusing Komodo of being like Enron at all. I used it as a metaphor for what transparency means.

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo is not a corporation

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If u were Microsoft and u found a zero day, would u disclose it before it was fixed?

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an open source project

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the source is open

[12-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is transparent in what matters the most

[12-Jan-19 10:17 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Like I said, not calling Komodo Enron. I brought up Enron as a metaphor to explain how the definition of transparency can differ. Does what I'm saying in the previous sentence make sense at all? I'm wondering why the confusion.

[12-Jan-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so we agree that komodo is being transparent in its relevant context

[12-Jan-19 10:18 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Of course, always agreed with that, sorry for the confusion.

[12-Jan-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i just dont like any association with some evil for profit corp that did some massive frauds

[12-Jan-19 10:18 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Lol, wasn't trying to associate, I promise! üò©

[12-Jan-19 10:20 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I was bringing up a problem for the security of open source projects in general. It's something all open source projects will struggle with at some point. The bigger the project, the more secure it will be.

[12-Jan-19 10:24 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Please try not to assume people are trolling over one piece of confusion. I know I have trouble recognizing it as well, Poe's Law and all, but I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.

[12-Jan-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[12-Jan-19 10:29 AM] garbonzo607#4659
"actually it needs 2 notarizations, so more like 20 minutes"

Are you saying the transaction won't be confirmed for 20 minutes, or it can't be secured before 20 minutes? Like, can I accept and deliver the order under the premise that it's very unlikely anything bad will happen (51% attack, notary collusion, etc.), even though it's possible, or can I not accept the transaction at all because it would be 100% unsafe?

[12-Jan-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
you are talking about a cross chain burn/import

[12-Jan-19 10:29 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Yes

[12-Jan-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are transacting on the same chain, which should be most of the time, then 1 notarization

[12-Jan-19 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You have been coming here for days poking holes that were all closed.... Trolling is a decent description

[12-Jan-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
not having notarization doesnt make it 100% unsafe and again your questions are trollish

[12-Jan-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so i am not assuming your are trolling, i am observing it based on your language

[12-Jan-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
going from 99.99% to 100%

[12-Jan-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
not from 0% to 100%

[12-Jan-19 10:31 AM] garbonzo607#4659
So you think I'm coming here and asking questions for shits and giggles? ü§î I need to understand a project before I can endorse it, support it, share it with friends, etc. If only everyone were so diligent, the world would be a better place.

[12-Jan-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea why you ask these questions. maybe to make things sound much worse than they are?

[12-Jan-19 10:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would, I for one have tried to answer your questions truthfully. There are notany issues with the underlying tech its solid.

[12-Jan-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, feel free to ask questions. we are answering them

[12-Jan-19 10:33 AM] garbonzo607#4659
@jl777c "going from 99.99% to 100%" That's what I was asking, because I wasn't sure. Thank you so much for the answer. üëåüèº

[12-Jan-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but for crosschain, there is no transaction possible until the notarizations

[12-Jan-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is not that the tx is unsafe, it is that you cant do the import until the notarization

[12-Jan-19 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no possible way to lose or gain coins... I've tested it so much.

[12-Jan-19 10:38 AM] garbonzo607#4659
What I mean is, in the future, would it be moderately safe to sell a $5 crypto kitty or whatever and not have to wait 10 - 20 minutes for the order to go through? My question is more about scaling and mainstream adoption. I'm not trying to poke holes, I'm just honestly wondering the route crypto will take for mainstream adoption. That's my one concern.

[12-Jan-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i envision that you would have coins for the chains you are normally transacting in. for $5 tx, you can just consider it final when it gets confirmed

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
cross chain is only needed when you need to convert coins, like having USD, EUR

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I see!

[12-Jan-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are in europe, convert USD to EUR ahead of time, then no need to crosschain for each tx

[12-Jan-19 10:45 AM] garbonzo607#4659
It sucks that I can't actually read about what this cross chain scaling solution is until I get to a computer or modern phone though.

[12-Jan-19 10:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User  I'll pay u 50 kmd to get this guy the kmd website in text ony

Google does it already, Google cache. I wouldn't want you to spend money for that. üòñ

[12-Jan-19 11:13 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Just finished reading those links, JL. Great reads. The article that mentions how it's more important to make your ideas public and unrefined, but fast, rather than waiting around to refine your ideas in private really made an impression on me.

The one on OmiseGo is sad, as I had high hopes for OMG in 2017, but didn't buy any for exactly this reason. The lack of transparency and communication were red flags. But Komodo should fulfill OMG's promises if everything goes according to plan, right?

[12-Jan-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not familiar with OMG promises

[12-Jan-19 11:37 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Basically a decentralized exchange capable of 1 million TPS where you can exchange one fiat currency, coin, or token, into another on the fly, seamlessly, from a mobile app. The dream was that if you had JPY and the merchant wanted USD, you could still pay the merchant with your JPY, and the merchant would receive USD, like nothing happened. Seems Komodo cross chain is similar, but you would need to exchange 20 minutes ahead of time. Which isn't quite as good but better than nothing.

[12-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
Cross chain is more like 10 minutes typically

[12-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
20 is very unlucky

[12-Jan-19 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
You would only ever need to do cross chain if there is a chain that has a feature the chain your coins are on do not

[12-Jan-19 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
or if someone is only accepting deposits on that chain for some reason

[12-Jan-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
It wouldn't be a big deal for an exchange to accept deposits on multiple fungible chains for example

[12-Jan-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the whole fiat issue is problematic...

[12-Jan-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but assuming you have fiat gateways and it maps to a token (or a fiat sidechain) then the komodo tech can work with it

[12-Jan-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
million tx/sec would saturate 10,000 chains, so it isnt very practical for a single chain to handle anywhere near that much traffic

[12-Jan-19 11:54 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
serving as fiat market maker can bring nice profit due to spread, but the problem I see is how to make such market maker not manipulate, so that a fiat-pegged asset would be stable, kind of special reward for stabilization weould need to be inveted, that would be good enough for big fiat players

[12-Jan-19 11:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
could also be that few big players establish a token as a value intermediary, but this will require them really trust each other not to wish to manipualte

[12-Jan-19 11:56 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
best I imagine would be energy-backed currency as lately I see currency = energy flow regulator

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this view is actually quite universal - life  - whatever it is either natural life or financial or any other natural process needs energy

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so energy is basic for anything

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
isn't that what bitcoin is?

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if you got energy you do not need currency / money

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] Alright#0419
"energy-backed currency"

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
BTC converts electricity to currency

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but it;'s not that

[12-Jan-19 11:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Im talking that you would have a token which give you right to energy source

[12-Jan-19 11:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so you would trade the token, but if you cannot trade it somehow you can access the orig energy it posses / oil/cvoalr/wind power ....

[12-Jan-19 11:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
recently I posted somewhere that energy decentralization is much more neede then money decentralization

[12-Jan-19 11:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
nobody liked my post üòÉ

[12-Jan-19 11:59 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[12-Jan-19 11:59 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
money is like share - it's just a legal paer that give you kind of ownership over sth

[12-Jan-19 11:59 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
USD used to be backed by gold - s oyo ucould withdraw it 100 years ago

[12-Jan-19 12:00 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so I claim energy-backed money is the future

[12-Jan-19 12:00 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and if the energy source could be decentralized (=anybody can create energy, like solar or wind)

[12-Jan-19 12:00 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
then you got also really decentralized money
