wouldnt anybody that didnt somehow magically stop all "hate, violence and discriminatory intolerance" be explicitly allowing it?

[07-May-19 01:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
yup..

[07-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
or does that mean you have to say you are against it, but not do anything about it and it becomes ok?

that is a fine line.. to try and stop certain things

[07-May-19 01:12 PM] PTYX#6840
@mrlynch when it translates from virtual to real life violence I do think a deeper look at the community should be taken. Like the Christchurch posts on 8chan. Censorship doesn't usually stop this behavior though, so censoring can exacerbate it in some cases. The bad people will just find a different place to congregate.

[07-May-19 01:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it means you have to ban whoever the shriekers say, but ignore anyone just as bad not being shrieked about

censorship doesn't help.. those ppl still exist and will still do their thing.. on the contrary if they're out in the open it gives the rest of us a chance to see who's who

[07-May-19 01:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the rising censorship might also be leading to violence as it is used as justification for a radicalised response

[07-May-19 01:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's not about ignorance, quite the contrary

[07-May-19 01:13 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah, outright censorship isn't the solution.

[07-May-19 01:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I still remember when being radical like the nija turtles was cool. now its a bit different, and not so cool.

[07-May-19 01:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think it was unjust when it was banned because of the NZ shooting but it wasnt because of the thousands of latin american women and men being killed that were posted daily

[07-May-19 01:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
some ppl did some good things in italy in the 20's as well, by banning and policing bad behavior

Same thing with the quarentine before the ban. It was because of a video of a white british woman being killed. No one bat an eye when it was african or latin american or whatever less relevant race

[07-May-19 01:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator they probably don't broadcast it. Most likely it's a live event.

Binance Security Breach Update
We have discovered a large scale security breach today, May 7, 2019 at 17:15:24. Hackers were able to obtain a large number of user API keys, 2FA codes, and potentially other info. The hackers used...

[07-May-19 11:40 PM] willofleo#7505
when DEX

[07-May-19 11:41 PM] willofleo#7505
Safu funds will be used apparently to cover all lost funds

[07-May-19 11:41 PM] willofleo#7505
however it is clear now that no CEX is safe

[07-May-19 11:42 PM] willofleo#7505
not even OG binance ,

[07-May-19 11:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
binance isnt really OG, its the new hotness

[07-May-19 11:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so now the only exchange i can trust anymore is bittrex, who did a huge KYC document rape of customers recently?  this sucks

[08-May-19 12:05 AM] willofleo#7505
mm2 cant come quick enough,

[08-May-19 12:07 AM] willofleo#7505
then again it may be some CZ master plan to be financially  efficient, have your exchange get hacked and write the missing funds off, and take in from pool of SAFU  funds

[08-May-19 12:08 AM] yorklab#7270
Komodo's new mobile DEX could become a hot item.

[08-May-19 12:08 AM] Alecandro#1179

[08-May-19 12:08 AM] Alecandro#1179
Any updates on when this will actually go live?

[08-May-19 12:09 AM] willofleo#7505
or group of employee  master plan a no loss strategy if it fails no funds lost because the have it just in a different address  / if it work a free 40 million odd from SAFU refunds

[08-May-19 12:09 AM] willofleo#7505
or a publicity stunt

[08-May-19 12:09 AM] willofleo#7505
or just a hack who knows

That will cause more damage than this 40m 7000 btc

[08-May-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
51% costs 400k/hour so that is 100 hrs for $40 mil, but each block that goes by is one block deeper so it seems impractical now

[08-May-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you offer a 20% bribe to miners, maybe they decide to do it

[08-May-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
after all they deployed a softfork via miners

[08-May-19 07:29 AM] jeezy#3408
if I understand it correctly thats what they were debating, basically bribing miners with $15-20MM to make the tx vanish

[08-May-19 09:39 AM] jansako#3330
Somebody is now taking a snapshot for 'Bitcoin Classic' just in case Binance succeeds with the reorg... lots of money to be made for whoever shouts the loudest about keeping BTC 'Pure'...

[08-May-19 09:40 AM] jansako#3330
It is too late IMO, would expect a lot of that BTC to have been traded & withdrawn already. It would just make people pissed at Binance for very little gain (comparably)

[08-May-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
I forked bitcoin 0.14 yesterday to keep a pure copy without segwit before legacy devs purge it

[08-May-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the rollback via mining would need to have been started within a couple hours from the hack to have any chance at all, and even then would require lots of participating miners, though for 300 BTC in fees, likely many would

[08-May-19 09:43 AM] jansako#3330
Big chance of a fork though, or 'original' chain taking back control later if pools would switch back.

[08-May-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this would be a fork that would resolve one way or another. once it does not sure why it would stay split, other than "classic" variant

[08-May-19 09:44 AM] jansako#3330
If I am a whale & I just made a lot of dough on an unrelated trade during that time which could be rolled back, guess what? I am counter-bribing the shit out of the miners too üòÉ

[08-May-19 09:45 AM] jansako#3330
Like I said just a big mess for no reason.

[08-May-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
most all of the transactions would just reconfirm

[08-May-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
when a block is reorged, all the tx in the reorged block goes back into the mempool

[08-May-19 09:45 AM] jansako#3330
OK

[08-May-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
only tx that have a conflicting double spending tx confirmed would not get reconfirmed

[08-May-19 09:46 AM] jansako#3330
so no issue for anyone else except if anyone just bought the stolen BTC OTC?

[08-May-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe tx from a very active wallet that would have reused a utxo in whatever reorged tx
