@Gordon Komodo it is hard enough to get two coins swap working as it is, to add a third coin in the mix (remember both nodes need to agree on all details) seems to make things very problematic

[17-Jul-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
being the default trading pair with a 10% dexfee advantage for the worlds largest atomic swap DEX, that will be a significant gain for KMD

@Gordon Komodo maybe there can be something done on the revshare side, but really if you want a fee reduction, just buy DEX. then you get a piece of all revshares

Good morning,I got this text from someone on twitter and I believe is right,what makes Komodo great is the unity in the community

[18-Jul-19 06:08 AM] bogybogy#3962
The crypto community is fighting a proxy battle. They are ill-prepared, with few presentable allies to hold the line against impending forays by lawmakers. And the proxy has a serious PR and credibility problem.,When the push comes to shove, the noisemakers on social media, the losers who post daily bromides, the "whales," pump-and-dump group operators, and the like have zero pull and zero power. They can't help. If invited, they'd be an embarrassment.The best defense against overeager lawmakers is a healthy community, with lots of use cases and positive outcomes, and people with credentials singing the praises of societal change to come.Crucially, the voices calling for an outright ban on crypto will get stronger and start consolidating. 


The crypto community needs to get ahead of the curve here and assemble a better presence in DC and elsewhere.

[18-Jul-19 06:12 AM] bogybogy#3962
I noticed a reluctance on the part of those who are crypto when it comes to testing a decentralized app, I think it's about convenience,

[18-Jul-19 07:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@bogybogy There is a lot of tribalism in crypto. People do not invest in projects for the tech, they invest for the pumpability. Until such time as vaporware projects are valued as such, there will be this division.

[18-Jul-19 07:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The gov trying to ban crypto actually is a good thing as it forces people to reevaluate this model. I just hope people that have sway in the crypto community realize the war that is coming and chooses freedom in place of pride/profits.

thanks for heads up @Alecandro , I'll find out who can update it.

In the meanwhile, @pbca26 made a new explorer: http://explorer.komodoplatform.com

- Hop between Smart Chain explorers
- Shows when a block or a transaction has been notarized (gets bitcoin protection)
- Can do a search across all Smart Chains and find which balances you hold (select "all coins" from earch bar's dropdown)
