Kmd soon on Trezor ? 🤔🤗

[27-Feb-19 07:21 PM] crumb#2550
i am subscribed to their newsletter and it said that Komodo is supported with 1.8.0

[27-Feb-19 07:22 PM] crumb#2550
so, yes this is very cool

[27-Feb-19 07:23 PM] crumb#2550
quote from newsletter:

We are happy to announce a new firmware update to Trezor One, bringing new features, coin support, and enhanced security.

In an ongoing effort to backport Trezor Core from Model T to Trezor One, we have made major architectural changes to Trezor One that guarantee compatibility with future updates, so that your original hardware wallet can continue to function at full capacity for as long as you use it. We also added support for new cryptocurrencies and tokens such as PIVX, Komodo, and NIX.

This update will by default roll out daily to a randomly selected 20% of devices until all are patched. If you would like to access the updates now, please visit Beta Wallet.

Anyone preordered the ledger nano x?

[27-Feb-19 07:39 PM] crumb#2550
my only question regarding KMD on Trezor, is how they solved the reward claiming functionality

[27-Feb-19 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
"adding support" doesn't necessarily mean "supports claiming KMD interest correctly"

[27-Feb-19 08:10 PM] crumb#2550
hence my question: How is/was it solved. guess we'll see it soon(ish)

Hi

[28-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Terry Armbruster#0427
Okay im making contact with komodo and ben o hanlon. Twitter @blockchainists account. Are you that mad I walked away or do i have a clever little troll who's actually looked at all my twitter accounts went through them made a hack account at Twitter etc etc and poses as you or Siddhartha? Lol when i attract the best to hack me as you know i can easily just go out buy a whole new device and provider set up on a whim its just a test to see if i respond or if they're supposedly good enough. Ok. That account called me out on my supposed bull chips. Does it know komodo is Malta based? Fmore does it know Maltese knights are another indep country in rome. Use my Latin name . lol. Surprise im there too.

[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] Terry Armbruster#0427
Anyways I have fbi uk rcmp involved now . thanks but i think you better find out who's the goof. You have money to just simply go to where he is and eliminate him. Simple as that. Remember who holds the real gold. 😎✌

TLDR: only desktops were affected and only if you restored an existing seed, and thats of course patched too by now

Android and ios do not use chromium/jxbrowser. also maybe he should note that Warith and Luke clickbaited with "plain text" when in the video its clear they have their fiddler "decrypt HTTPS" button on (proving it was SSL).

@Angelos | Coinomi Wallet as a KMD developer, I don't agree with your articles statement that they were acting ` totally irresponsibly`, they were doing a community service to prevent more people from suffering loss of funds. Also, JL doesn't tweet.

[28-Feb-19 12:47 PM] Regnar#6164
What is your purpose in coming here Angelos, are you suggesting we shouldn't advise our community members to take precautions and remove funds from a wallet that has credible evidence it is broadcasting Seed phrases? We have an obligation to our users, if it turns out to be a false alarm so be it, but how many people should we wait to tell us there's a fire before we take it seriously? Secondly, as far as I'm concerned footnote 2 in your medium article suggests you dont actually KNOW that Google hasn't archived 400 API requests and the body text that caused it for their debugging purposes. 

I'm 100% standing behind the decision to take precautions over not. How you and the person who originally reported this dealt with the situation wasn't great, and this whole thing could have been avoided with a more understanding approach and realizing he was obviously panicking, the situation should have been diffused there, but it was handled poorly on both sides. As soon as that was out, we have an obligation to our community to warn them of potential risks.
