[16-Mar-19 08:19 AM] cryptopleb#8063
If i go to media and internet search i find barterdex p2p exchange

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But not even work and top 100 crypto

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
the dex is just 1 part of the platform

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Very upset

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
i can understand, but this is new tech

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
don't expect it to work instantly

[16-Mar-19 08:20 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But Bancor work and other

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I even try Blocknet after and work too

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But i want to build app between dex

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
With Bancor, every transaction is executed directly against a smart contract

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jorian#4555
that's not a dex like barterdex

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Correct

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the barterDEX works, but you need to set up all the nodes properly

[16-Mar-19 08:21 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But ETH side it is ok for now

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] gcharang#6833
> If i go to media and internet search i find barterdex p2p exchange

Even now if you can stomach CLI trades can be done very easily

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
during the transition, we are not maintaining the various nodes

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not end user ready via GUI

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Who are we?

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
who are you?

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I want to use node

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Not electrum

[16-Mar-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then use a node

[16-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but you need to set up your own barterDEX network for now as we are transitionioning to mm2

[16-Mar-19 08:23 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So i need more than 2 trader?

[16-Mar-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
all the code is there to do this, but it is not for end users

[16-Mar-19 08:24 AM] cryptopleb#8063
This is trouble:

[16-Mar-19 08:24 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Who broadcast order

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand what it means that the service is not available right now?

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want it available you need to setup the entire system

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Yes

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be done via cli

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But how to setup for order broadcast

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
LP node, seed node and client node

[16-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it all works just fine if things are setup

[16-Mar-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is not setup, it wont work

[16-Mar-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so far, you are the only one to complain that it is not running

[16-Mar-19 08:27 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I find way to do things to help my user

[16-Mar-19 08:27 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And we need full DX

[16-Mar-19 08:27 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But what is this stuff you talk about

[16-Mar-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
who is "we"

[16-Mar-19 08:27 AM] cryptopleb#8063
We is my team

[16-Mar-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
which team is this?

[16-Mar-19 08:28 AM] cryptopleb#8063
We are private investor group seeking DEX üòÉ

[16-Mar-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are resistance or safetrade?

[16-Mar-19 08:28 AM] cryptopleb#8063
No

[16-Mar-19 08:29 AM] cryptopleb#8063
We are looking for safe DX no kyc to make big otc orders

[16-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
using cli would be the way, but wait for mm2. it is in testing now and we are transitioning to it. mm1 is deprecated

[16-Mar-19 08:31 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Before side chat i ask question about broadcast and maintain of order

[16-Mar-19 08:32 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I need to know who handle.  I thought i handle this

[16-Mar-19 08:32 AM] cryptopleb#8063
With full node

[16-Mar-19 08:32 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And p2p

[16-Mar-19 08:32 AM] cryptopleb#8063
BNB chain have validator server for this

[16-Mar-19 08:33 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Centralized though

[16-Mar-19 08:34 AM] gcharang#6833
> LP node, seed node and client node

seed node: creates the network (can be done by anyone; even yourself)
LP node: seller
 client node: buyer

these are in the old dex; I am not sure how it is done in the new DEX but P2P is fundamental

[16-Mar-19 08:34 AM] jorian#4555
also bittorrent DHT. it is really p2p

[16-Mar-19 08:34 AM] jorian#4555
#dev-tradebots is a channel to check and ask

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So who broadcast order though

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
you do

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Ok

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
or, your node, specifically

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone else impressed and happy that Cryptopleb wants to ensure his full node, security and decentralization?

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jorian#4555
yes üëç

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So i get to broadcast

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Rare to see it seems.

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] gcharang#6833
and other nodes in the network help you by re-broadcasting it

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But it seem that just not working now

[16-Mar-19 08:35 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Can i add peer to receive?

[16-Mar-19 08:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pleb, you may be a little early.   MarketMaker 2 will make you happy I bet.

[16-Mar-19 08:36 AM] cryptopleb#8063
It make me so aggravating no receive

[16-Mar-19 08:36 AM] cryptopleb#8063
SO aggravating üòÉ

https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/setup-FR-full-relay-node-barterDEX.html#what-is-a-full-relay-fr-node

[16-Mar-19 08:37 AM] gcharang#6833
There are solutions in development that make all this very easy and straightforward
So if you can, please wait for mm2 release

[16-Mar-19 08:38 AM] cryptopleb#8063
@FishyGuts thank you for tip üòÉ  We need full node for insure client security üòÉ

[16-Mar-19 08:38 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Can barter dex code be easy integration into blocknet?

[16-Mar-19 08:39 AM] cryptopleb#8063
There was another who try full node validate but cannot think right now

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I want to create application that will take multi dex in 1 spot

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Everyone win üòÉ

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] gcharang#6833
Does blocknet use pure atomic swaps or use an on-chain dex?

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] cryptopleb#8063
They only use chain for tx print to blockchain

[16-Mar-19 08:40 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So pure in swap yes

[16-Mar-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
contact @cipi who is expert on low level barterdex

[16-Mar-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but you need to do cli

[16-Mar-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
not GUI

[16-Mar-19 08:41 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I can do CLI but normals cant üòÉ

[16-Mar-19 08:42 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I feel apologize now, sometime i get so aggravate that boom

[16-Mar-19 08:42 AM] gcharang#6833
If you want to understand the internals ask cipi; for normals they can use mm2 when it is released

[16-Mar-19 08:42 AM] cryptopleb#8063
But it sound like i can check back later

[16-Mar-19 08:42 AM] cryptopleb#8063
I would like to talk to cipi yes

[16-Mar-19 08:44 AM] cryptopleb#8063
So with update: client handle order broadcast

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Smart address check full node validate on blockchain

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] cryptopleb#8063
To know where blockchain data

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Since smartaddress import into wallet

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, fullnode only was how it was originally, SPV mode was added later

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] cryptopleb#8063
Yes

[16-Mar-19 08:46 AM] cryptopleb#8063
And that is last part

[16-Mar-19 08:47 AM] cryptopleb#8063
SPV node is electrum?

[16-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes
