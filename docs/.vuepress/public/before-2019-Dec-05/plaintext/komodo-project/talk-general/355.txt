make sure the dust payment sent to your old address has 'S' in the explorer for your old address. if not, that means you did not send it to the new address. send all funds to the new address to solve this

[09-Jun-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if you did not get the early refund, that means you missed the cutoff yesterday, or made multiple claims or your address is contested or it is over 7777 KMD

[09-Jun-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
plz do not be making DM asking about these things. it is always the same answer.

Just back from a couple of days off grid to find my KMD back safe in my  new address - amazing effort by whole team and can’t thank you enough for being there having our backs when things got tricky. Anyone who thinks  that they would rather have no coins over safe returned protected in the heat of battle coins is mad and just doesn’t understand what could have just happened. Thank you all again

@jl777c if I use multiple addresses ( 16 pieces ) How long do I have to expect that the processing lasts ... I submitted everything (assets and KMD) with a claim

[09-Jun-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD first, assets will take longer as it is almost as much work as KMD for each assetchain

[09-Jun-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the number of addresses doesnt matter

[09-Jun-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what matters is if you did the proper steps and didnt submit conflicting data

200+ people have yet to send all funds from their old address to new, until you do that, the refund processor wont do your refund

[09-Jun-19 04:59 PM] ectrader#5859
I read so much information that it isn't clear for me..... so maybe a stupid question, but if I still have my kmd coins on my own kmd address, do I still need to create a new  wallet address in the verus agama wallet?

[09-Jun-19 05:01 PM] ectrader#5859
my final balance on my kmd address is good, so I don't need to send them to a new created kmd address?

[09-Jun-19 05:01 PM] ectrader#5859
right?

[09-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Yassin#3685
@ghost.in.the.dao i think you have use Native mode, Native mode no ndeed password, it is file .dat, if you use lite node, you need WIF or passphrase

[09-Jun-19 09:01 PM] double o#8101
Hello, Admin... I downloaded the entire ocean qt wallet (took a looong time), I filled out the form and did receive a small transaction to my old agama address.  I had closed the ocean qt wallet. And now every time I try to open the ocean qt wallet I get an error. It reads “...thread ‘<unnamed>’ panicked at couldn’t finish reading Sprout groth16 at parameter file: 0s { code: 5, kind: Other, message: “Input/output error” } , libcore/result.rs:945:5
Note: Run with ‘RUST_BACKTRACE=1’ for a backtrace.
Abort trap: 6 
Logout 
...

The oceanqt address that I can’t open anymore is the address that I indicated on my form!  I’ve tried to restart my cpu many times but still get this error.  Should I download the Verus wallet(agama-macOS-v0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview.dmg)?, and if so do I need to submit another form with my new Verus address, or can I just send a small transaction from the tiny funds that were sent to my agama address?  (Argh this is very frustrating!!) any assistance would be much appreciated

[09-Jun-19 09:02 PM] double o#8101
I downloaded the whole block chain, and selected an address (which I what I used in my form). I don’t recall being prompted to write a seed phrase down. Perhaps I didn’t download it completely? I closed the application and cannot open it again.I will try to do download/open the verus wallet to obtain a new address. I can resend the tiny transaction back that I had received after filling out my form. Do I need to fill out a new form? I don’t know what I should do

[09-Jun-19 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007

[09-Jun-19 09:42 PM] double o#8101
