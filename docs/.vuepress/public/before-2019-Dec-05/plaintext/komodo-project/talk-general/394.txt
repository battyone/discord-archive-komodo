OTC markets is 3x bigger than we have on our exchanges,how we can improve so OTC can t control the market how they like

[14-Jul-19 11:57 PM] crumb#2550
short answer is, you can't. OTC will always exist

[14-Jul-19 11:58 PM] crumb#2550
why worry about it. long term it doesn't matter much

[15-Jul-19 12:16 AM] yorklab#7270
Wouldn't the AtomicDEX be considered OTC of some sorts? If so, and AtomicDEX works as advertised, I think it could become very popular.

[15-Jul-19 12:34 AM] rainbro7#4735
Can any coin be added by any individual? For example, ergo is a new coin with its own code, how can it be added?

[15-Jul-19 12:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@rainbro7 
atomicDEX is the GUI
it is most likely it won't support all the available coins

but any fork of BTC can be atomicswapped by following the instructions here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/README.md

we also still have etomic, so ERC20 tokens were also exchangeable.

[15-Jul-19 12:51 AM] NNoperator#3835
Assume that they will be again with atomicDEX.

[15-Jul-19 12:52 AM] allbits#5898
ERC20 tokens can be exchanged, but etomic no longer required

Hi! Is there a problem with KMD Rwards on Verus Agama Wallet?

[15-Jul-19 02:57 AM] manugarc#3097
My rewards seem to be stopped.  Does this has to do with an update or something??

[15-Jul-19 03:00 AM] bishop#9773
What version are you using, when was your last claim, over 10 as your utxo?

[15-Jul-19 03:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What changed that made etomic obsolete?

[15-Jul-19 03:05 AM] gcharang#6833
`etomic` made our dex almost a proxy token dex when eth/erc20 were being swapped

now the regular atomic swap protocol has been implemented without needing the extra `etomic` token

[15-Jul-19 03:10 AM] altcoinist#1501

last time I checked was 4 days ago and th balance is still the same today

[15-Jul-19 03:22 AM] manugarc#3097
its not accumulating rewards

[15-Jul-19 03:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@manugarc check your address here: https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards
if it doesn't have rewards, send the whole balance to yourself
that should fix it, and rewards will start accruing

Good morning to everyone,last week I found great economics books written by Friedricj Hayek -he didn't hold the technology from today in 1974 but o believe Komodo can reach  his vision -hayek—i have now no doubt whatever that private enterprise,if it had not been prevented by government could  and would long ago have provided the public with a choice of currencies,and those that prevailed in the competition would have been essentialy stable in value and would have prevented both excesive stimulation of investment and the consquent periods of contraction-Denationalisation of money

[15-Jul-19 05:09 AM] bogybogy#3962
The Denationalization of Money is a 1976 book by Friedrich Hayek, in which the author advocated the establishment of competitively issued private moneys.[1] In 1978 Hayek published a revised and enlarged edition entitled Denationalization of Money: The Argument Refined, where he speculated that rather than entertaining an unmanageable number of currencies, markets would converge on one or only a limited number of monetary standards, on which institutions would base the issue of their notes.[2]

[15-Jul-19 05:10 AM] bogybogy#3962
Reading and trying to understand Komodo everyday just open your vision

OTC is not about controlling markets, as it is... OTC

investment vector =/= trading and speculating even if that can happen afterwards

[15-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
what happens to coins *after* otc is another story ^^

[15-Jul-19 08:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
for example when jl buys 50BTC of KMD, price is not affected, as it s done OTC

[15-Jul-19 08:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
buying the same amount on an exchange would not be the same at all

[15-Jul-19 08:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
a big fat injection non OTC could be seen as price manipulation by regulators btw, and regulators don t like price manipulation

[15-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
people seems not to remember the start of p2p filesharing. I believe dex could be treated just like that. Being a liquidity provider or marketmaker is not something to play with without knowing what you do, but that s just my opinion

honestly, Andreas M. Antonopoulos use of 'Komodo' is not a coincidence I think. He surely knows about KMD so why else would he use those words?

[15-Jul-19 11:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why else would he use those words?`
imagery 
It's not really any different than if he used an analogy of trees growing; because if he said "it starts out as a little sapling" zec fanboys would read the same thing into it as kmd fanboys are reading into the imagery he did use

From the early days of jl777 atomic swap archeology to the cc modules you are all contributing to, it has for me at least, been a spectacular learning experience and one that I am proud to have witnessed. All power to you Team Komodo 🙌🏼 May your lives be healthy and your years plentiful. **L O N G   L I V E.  K O M O D O**
