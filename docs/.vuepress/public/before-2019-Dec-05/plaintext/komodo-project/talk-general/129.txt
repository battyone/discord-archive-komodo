we got 20% negative votes, so if we do not get more positive we could drop from the 1st page when more negative surely will come

we made it to top 6 (still got around 20% negative votes) - posting img so that when XMR turns on the downvoting bots we keep it as souvenir :pirate:

@jl777c plz tell us ur thought on komodo DEX and bisq privacy level for normal  user

[09-Nov-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
bisq?

@jl777c bisq the decentralised exchange use of tor and komodo decentralised exchange for normal user its trade off and advantages over other...

[09-Nov-18 05:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Bisq is for fiat/crypto and web based, BarterDEX is crypto/crypto and a p2p app

[09-Nov-18 05:13 PM] plazma#1625
@KomodoWorld wait isn't bisq have an app of p2p and does BarterDEX have better privacy....how will u rank it in terms of privacy attack vectors....

[09-Nov-18 05:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
sorry I was confusing Bisq with HodlHodl

[09-Nov-18 05:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Bisq doesn't do atomic swaps, it has an escrow system and does arbitrage in case of dispute

[09-Nov-18 05:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
BarterDEX is direct trading that either happens or doesn't happen

[09-Nov-18 05:18 PM] plazma#1625
@KomodoWorld correct in bisq u also need a tiny amount of btc to hold as security....new user with no btc like me can't even use bisq

[09-Nov-18 05:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
fiat/crypto ramps without KYC are hard to do

I have like 11 komodo and 17 pirate can i use BarterDEX

[09-Nov-18 05:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Pirates doesn't work on barterDex, tech doesn't allow (yet) atomic swaps with shielded addresses

@Regnar  if I'm not mistaken opid is Agama internal operation id created before even tx is sent. opid not visible on the block explorer, but visible in the wallet. After tx is created there is just tx id which is visible on block explorer and can be seen publickly.

for z tx it takes time to create valid z tx, so before you got tx id there is opid. For other wallets the time diff is small enough not to bother with opid probably.
