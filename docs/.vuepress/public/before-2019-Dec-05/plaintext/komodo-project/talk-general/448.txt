I'm just thinking if the term DEFI should be used here and there when communicating with the public / in marketing

[12-Nov-19 04:24 PM] Lennart#9331
isn't Atomic Dex kind of decentralized finance anyway?

[12-Nov-19 04:25 PM] Lennart#9331

[12-Nov-19 05:16 PM] tomsmith26#8707
So I can say at this time KMD will be a safest coin and platform for quantum computer

[12-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Untill proven otherwise üôÇ

[12-Nov-19 05:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem is that you cant really say with 100% certainty ANYTHING is quantum resistant until you have quantum computers having a go at it

[12-Nov-19 05:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But for now, with the knowledge we have about quantum computers KMD and dilithium signatures seems to be a safe bet

[13-Nov-19 05:15 AM] mrdotboson#5783
Is there something like Metamask but for Komodo?

[13-Nov-19 06:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@mrdotboson we have a static html wallet which uses nSPV
so, you run a lightweight program on your computer (tiny storage and RAM requirements, no download of blockchain) 
then access it through a browser

not exactly like metamask

[13-Nov-19 07:02 AM] Oszy#5734
Metamask isn't just a "browser extension wallet", it's used to have access to different ETH chains for dApps

[13-Nov-19 07:46 AM] gcharang#6833
nSPV can access different Smart Chains and Antara modules on them too

[13-Nov-19 08:06 AM] Oszy#5734
Yes, if there will ever be such extension built, it will be "something like" Metamask

[13-Nov-19 09:13 AM] Petrus#8039

Net asset value

[13-Nov-19 12:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
The value of the assets it holds

[13-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Lennart#9331
so as a supernet holder you hope/trust the kmd team / jl777 to make wise investment strategies, right?

[13-Nov-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I trust that since they are invested as well and they prefer to make profit as opposed to lose their investments

[13-Nov-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
My trust comes from that, not implicitly that they are team members

[13-Nov-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They have the most at stake to do well

üëÜüèΩ 

[13-Nov-19 01:01 PM] crumb#2550
plus SuperNET holds a lot of revenue generating assets, so it's a healthy strategy of organic growth, instead of just wild speculations

[13-Nov-19 01:02 PM] Lennart#9331
thank you. I only want to understand it better. Is "they" primarily JL777? Assetholders receive revenues from revenue-generating assets, for example if some holding would be proof of stake, that revenue would go to Supernet holders? also DEX fees, KMD rewards.. right? Tha value of the supernet coin comes from it's holdings, or above mentioned NAV

[13-Nov-19 01:02 PM] Lennart#9331
thx for explaining

[13-Nov-19 01:02 PM] CHMEX#0686
jl has sad in the past if there are enough peole ( power by holding) who wish to liquidate an asset he will do it.

[13-Nov-19 01:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
and thats the most common one which is easier to understand ^

[13-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Lennart#9331
yeah i know that one. but it doesnt explain much. for example "50%" to holders makes sense for DEX but for Supernet..? What 50%? Where does it come from etc. But i have a somewhat clearer picture now

[13-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Lennart#9331
also how is the payout scheme? when revenues achieve 1 mio usd value?

[13-Nov-19 01:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
Supernet holds DEX and CRYPTO

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
once the DEX and CRYPTO dividends are paid SUpernet get it's share

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
and that share is passed to the holder at 50%

[13-Nov-19 01:12 PM] CHMEX#0686
btw CRYPTO has again 800kUSD in holdings

[13-Nov-19 01:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
in december 2017 SN send dividends to holders received via crypto
I hope that makes sense?

there's enough sugar in coffee, when the spoon stands straight up

@Cryptoon not that directly, but all "milk" in the US stores is 20-40% water

Seriously?

dont think that's even legal in EU

[14-Nov-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it has to be "re-added" due to the loss during pasteurization, and they fudge the numbers for profit

[14-Nov-19 12:57 PM] crumb#2550
check out the expiration dates on that store milk @Cryptoon . normal milk spoils in couple of days. some store milk has expiration dates few weeks
