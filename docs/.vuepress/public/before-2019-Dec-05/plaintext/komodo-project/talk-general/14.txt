I'm unable to open the Komodo website, I tried many times but loading takes forever

[25-Jun-18 10:13 AM] PTYX#6840
It loaded very fast for me

[25-Jun-18 10:14 AM] PTYX#6840
Try a different connection if possible or clear your cache

[25-Jun-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also have not been able to load it for a fair while. I will try clear cache and see if that helps.

[25-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Snizzly#5519
h everyone, new to komodo here. Look promising. Got a question about confirmation: why does binance require 120 confirmations for komodo deposit :)?

[25-Jun-18 11:10 AM] PTYX#6840
We required them to raise the limit due to the equihash attacks

[25-Jun-18 11:11 AM] PTYX#6840
It's better to be safe than sorry

[25-Jun-18 11:11 AM] PTYX#6840
It used to be 3 confirmations

[25-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Snizzly#5519
alright

[25-Jun-18 11:25 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
10 confirmations would be enough if they checked notarization ?

[25-Jun-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> 1 notarization should be enough, but the exchanges can't really check for them using existing tools they have I think.

Apples are sexier. Kiwis have a weird accent. They live near Austria.

[26-Jun-18 05:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which coin?

[26-Jun-18 05:35 AM] LocoMB#8593
KMD Lite mode

[26-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Go to settings and switch spv servers

[26-Jun-18 05:36 AM] LocoMB#8593
I only see 2 servers in the list

[26-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also which version of agama

[26-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Try the other one

[26-Jun-18 05:36 AM] LocoMB#8593
Version: 0.2.33-beta

[26-Jun-18 05:37 AM] LocoMB#8593
had this for some could be a new one out already#

[26-Jun-18 05:37 AM] LocoMB#8593
did try boith - same result

[26-Jun-18 05:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Better update to latest first

[26-Jun-18 05:38 AM] gcharang#6833
version 2.40 of agama is available here and in last phase of testing: https://artifacts.supernet.org/latest/
Try using it and if you face connectivity issues again, follow this guide: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/353075201/How+to+solve+SPV+connectivity+issues+when+using+Agama+in+lite+SPV+mode

yay! Thanks! 🚁

[26-Jun-18 05:48 AM] LocoMB#8593
@Cryptoon - sorry to bother - just went to 0.2.40 but still SPV server unreachable

[26-Jun-18 05:52 AM] LocoMB#8593
I'll try to increase socket timeout

[26-Jun-18 06:07 AM] gcharang#6833
If that doesn't work, enable the proxy 😃

[26-Jun-18 07:28 AM] LocoMB#8593
no such luck yet - I'll try from another internet connection later

[26-Jun-18 09:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@cipi  @ca333

[26-Jun-18 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
they are up, pbca is working on an update of Agama

[26-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What changed? Something on the spv side?

[26-Jun-18 11:10 AM] cipi#4502
yes, v1.0 API was removed, only 1.1 active now

[26-Jun-18 11:42 AM] PTYX#6840
Which improvements came with 1.1?

[26-Jun-18 11:44 AM] cipi#4502
1.1 is there for a very long time, since i started running electrums... i have no idea

[26-Jun-18 11:49 AM] PTYX#6840
oh ok

[26-Jun-18 11:50 AM] PTYX#6840
i thought we would get some cool upgrades

[26-Jun-18 11:50 AM] PTYX#6840
next time we should make sure there is an announcement to all wallet and service providers

[26-Jun-18 11:50 AM] PTYX#6840
specially if there is an spv outtage (even if temporary)

[26-Jun-18 11:51 AM] cipi#4502
yes,  already talked to pbca... next time i will write him directly... did that only in the team channel asking if someone is using 1.0 API...

[26-Jun-18 11:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
@cipi will this affect `marketmaker`/HyperDEX?

[26-Jun-18 11:59 AM] cipi#4502
marketmaker is not affected, i searched the code for the old API calls and there were no old API calls... and i also use mm all the time, so i would have seen it if there would have been problems

[26-Jun-18 11:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
great, thanks for confirming
