@joe2x4 that's closer to what I need, but I don't want to tunnel through the internet (most specifically because I'll loose access to media files when internet is down)

[31-Aug-18 03:06 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and you'd be wasting bandwidth on both networks just to communicate. There's gotta be a way to do that similarly but without the internet. I was googling yesterday trying to figure something out @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ha

[31-Aug-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
too bad there isnt a smart cable that can bridge

[31-Aug-18 03:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm certain that there's a way (it's been too long since the days of my IT classes for me to remember most of it) to have 2 separate networks in the same physical location and allow cross communication without involving the interweb.

[31-Aug-18 03:14 PM] xRobeSx#5136
do you have a 3rd router for a bridge like you mentioned before? I'm reading about setting up a transit network for the 2 to connect

[31-Aug-18 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I have plenty of routers, cable, and switches to do whatever, I just can't find anything that says "do x, then y, then z"

[31-Aug-18 03:18 PM] joe2x4#5987
If two separate networks in same physical location, solution will probably still involve a router on each end connected to each other. How far apart are they

[31-Aug-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
4' (1.3m)

Connecting two networks without sharing internet access
Why would you bridge this?  You are using 2 different networks so you would not bridge your networks. What sort of router is your cousin using? The proper way to do this would be with a site to site connection over your wireless bridge between the locatio...

[31-Aug-18 03:27 PM] cipi#4502
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you just need to place the 2 routers into the same network, with the same netmask, like 192.168.0.0/24 ... but you will have to disable the DHCP-servers on router1 and router2 and configure one on router3, so you have only one DHCP in your network and not 2 or 3

[31-Aug-18 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@cipi if I did that, then how would they retain their separate internet connections (as that reads like it would be just 1 network)

[31-Aug-18 03:31 PM] cipi#4502
hmm, you are right, i forgot that... then the only possibility is to maintain 2 separate networks but configure the routing stuff on router3... could be a bit tricky and it depends on the capabilities of router3, e.g. it should be possible to manually configure routing tables on that router

[31-Aug-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, that's the issue... thusfar I haven't found an idiots guide to config router 3 that doesn't involve ssh and some commandline shit that makes my eyes cross just looking at it

[31-Aug-18 03:36 PM] cipi#4502
lol ... yes, i fear ssh and cli would be needed to do that... something like `route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0`

[31-Aug-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my only real problem with copy/pasting the couple ssh things I found is that since I don't understand it, I'm screwed if anything ever stops working

@DimgDongSoLong new coins "help" in many ways, some instantly recognizable and some benefits may not be seen for a long time to come

personally, I think a privacy only coin is awesome

[31-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why do you need the two seperate networks? As a failover or different reason?

[31-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
two separate internet connections sorry

[31-Aug-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon Because my ISP sucks, 10M is the "best" per-line we can get here, and I want to watch Netflix and not have it interfere with my ability to propagate blocks

[31-Aug-18 04:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I'm exhausted from manually switching cables back and forth from network to network depending on what I need to connect to

[31-Aug-18 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha I see, well you have routers that take 2 ISP lines for failover reasons, maybe a possibility with those routers is to point ISP 1 to devices 1.... x and ISP 2 to other devices on the network?

[31-Aug-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not for failover, 1 for personal and 1 for mining

[31-Aug-18 04:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes I know, but I mean that for example cisco has routers that take 2 isps, maybe an option in those routers that instead of using the two isps for failover, is to use them to use them for different devices on the network

[31-Aug-18 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Load balancing maybe?

[31-Aug-18 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`maybe a possibility with those routers is to point ISP 1 to devices 1.... x and ISP 2 to other devices on the network?`
That's what I have but I also need device1 on network1 to be able to talk to device6 on network2

Internet Load Balancing and Failover for Multiple ISP Links
When people think of load balancing, they usually think about traffic that is inbound to the server. But what about traffic that goes outbound from the client, or internet user? The wide area network (WAN) or internet links going from a user’s site to multiple internet serv...

[31-Aug-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't want to bond them in any way

[31-Aug-18 04:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you have one network, but the ISP load is split

[31-Aug-18 04:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k, then that is obviously not an option

[31-Aug-18 04:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
2 virtual seperate networks on one router with load balancing?

[31-Aug-18 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
network1 needs to stay network1
network2 needs to stay network2
but I need to communicate between the 2 networks

[31-Aug-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not about balancing, balancing/bonding will bring back the same issue as if I only had 1 internet connection (because using max uses max)

[31-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Daiyox#2701
I would look into setting up proxy-arp, that would be the correct way to join two IP networks locally

[31-Aug-18 05:41 PM] joe2x4#5987
is it possible to install a second NIC, one on each network and use those to link the networks.

[31-Aug-18 05:42 PM] DimgDongSoLong#4467
Anyone else hear about this IOTA doing a million tps?

[31-Aug-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
While I appreciate the offer of help, please stop suggesting things that are exactly what I don't want; @joe2x4 there's no part of me that's going to install 2 NIC cards on 9 different PCs, and even if I did it still wouldn't allow media to be shared to the TV

[31-Aug-18 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Daiyox that's close to what I want, but still no idiots guide on how to do it

[31-Aug-18 07:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
No problem boss. 👍

[31-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
You just need to separate subnets and a router to allow comunication

[31-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Just a l3 switch with different vlan may work too)

[31-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can buy old cisco l3 for less than 50 bucks

[31-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
In case of vlan ports you will have complete broadcast isolation for a very low price

not necessary, VRSC will, in the future, let other projects to build on top of it, hence other projects might be using the verushash as well.

OH...so they should only maximize testers if you're interested in the premise, not because test coins need testers; now I get it

[01-Sep-18 01:20 AM] bishop#9773
but if there is "no market" to obtain coins (didn't see a faucet), there is no way to mine it practically as I'm not pointing z9s at it
