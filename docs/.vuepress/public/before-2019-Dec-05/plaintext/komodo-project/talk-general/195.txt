When will KMD be updated on CMC that its listed on Coinbene?

[02-Feb-19 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
likely at some point *after* it's listed and functioning

sorry - even in the weekends we have a lot of work @kolo + it misses a touch of crypto - let our community try it first.

About Blackbeard's puzzle it's total unclear too ... Good puzzle can be solved without any "hints", users should clearly know where he should start. Hint "see the dots" gives nothing. I'm already tried even to extract each section name in hex from this dots and combine passphrase. Nothing )

tip for @Blackbeard his puzzle - its really just **IN the interview text**. The rest is irrelevant (no pictures, no non-interview things, look only at the text).

[02-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
and the dots

the hints means basically read the text - watch out for dots cuz they are like checkpoints. kinda.. but blackbeard has to release the last hint - then it should be clear.

[03-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Decker#3767
i'm tried to combine words after dots, or words before dots, or every word in article with "." in the end ... wrong way ...

[03-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Gawain#7858
Yeah, I ran out of ideas so just waiting üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 01:16 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
I wonder if the "to the very end" hint has anything to do with "end user apps" I tried a few things but no luck

[03-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Decker#3767
I have other idea ... seems the key is not just a word from text. We have 4 groups of dots in text, like:
```
...
some text 1
...
some text 2
...
some text 3
...
```
Final passphrase can consist of 3 words, the describing the meaning of text1 + text2 + text3 ...

[03-Feb-19 01:21 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
Yeah this puzzle seems out there hopefully with 4th hint will become clear

Damn that‚Äôs crazy. Makes me so excited for the rest of 2019

[03-Feb-19 03:04 AM] Gawain#7858
amazon seems to really miss the point - blockchain doesn't mean decentralized

[03-Feb-19 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly

[03-Feb-19 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You use terh AWS to spint up the starting nodes to create the blockchain... This has always been a hard part for users. Once the chain is started and the AWS nodes are used as seeds then it out in the wild and anyone can sync it and mine it. If people are using it and minieg it then the AWS nodes then can be switcvhed off.. 
It allows people to easily create lots of diff chains, with difffrent params, quickly and easily.

[03-Feb-19 03:08 AM] Alecandro#1179
That is so cool haha

[03-Feb-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Using AWS now in my gateways tests - buying quite cheap spot nodes for a few hours, then in a few clicks spin X nodes from pre-created snapshot

With KMD labs we made a way to notarise these chains with as littlke as 2 notary nodes, so you will be able to have dPoW for cross chain, contracts as stuff with it aswell.. Once I get time to go help them with it.

Obviously, using just 2 notary nodes is in no wayt secure... But for development... it is perfectly fine and very cheap.

[03-Feb-19 01:02 PM] ca333#0118
like @blackjok3r pointed out this is not just a "create your blockchain automagically in under a minute" system - it is far more. Thanks for #kmdlabs for example we re integrating the dpow-lite technology to offer freshly created chains BTC level security quasi instantly! And the features listed above and mentioned in this channel arent even everything. We wont disclose the full details due to the copycats in the industry - however, you all know who did it a) first and b) solid. We have been working on this for over tha last half year.
