I have exactly as many coins as Jeff's bastardized version of Agama allowed me to create

[30-Jun-18 04:50 PM] Tyrael#0138
I raise 10 kmd to kick or at least ban this toon

[30-Jun-18 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you don't like how many CoinX I have, then take that up with the devs of CoinX

[30-Jun-18 04:55 PM] PTYX#6840
@Cya i will say, the Komodo team has better things to do than worry about who is hacking or not backing safecoin. These seem like personal concerns to me since no Komodo team member is involved. In fact, community members offered help in pointing out and patching their bugs.

[30-Jun-18 04:56 PM] Cya#2719
yes  @PTYX im aware, but i thought it should be known that this guy @ComputerGenie is not to be trusted.

[30-Jun-18 04:56 PM] Cya#2719
i have no bad feelings towards kmd whatsoever but this guy... well..

[30-Jun-18 04:56 PM] PTYX#6840
@computergenie while unconventional he is of help to us and hsnt given us a reason for Mistrust

[30-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Cya#2719
and as he always shills kmd in the safe discord i thought this might be where id find him

[30-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Cya#2719
i apologize for interuption.

[30-Jun-18 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you release an app that says "click this button and get a free 5% of your balance" I'm clicking the feker; it's on you if you feked it to where it worked every 2 seconds

[30-Jun-18 04:57 PM] PTYX#6840
I would stay away from safecoin since it seems they are touchy and can misconstrue any action from people who don't represent Komodo's core team

[30-Jun-18 04:58 PM] PTYX#6840
However, we can't control what third parties do.

[30-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Cya#2719
yes im aware, as i said, i apologize for interupting, but i got a bit annoyed at the crap he keeps posting and i know he lurks in here.

[30-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Cya#2719
ill back out now sorry again.

[30-Jun-18 04:58 PM] PTYX#6840
I have personally reached out to their devs before and we have a neutral relationship. I wish them well in their project. Thank you for understanding :)

[30-Jun-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"but i got a bit annoyed at the crap he keeps posting "
Then perhaps you shouldn't have randomly tagged him out of the blue and asked him to post more? ü§î

did that really happened? how...? ho...?

no, i don't want to know üòÇ

[30-Jun-18 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
When CoinX forked and bastardized komodod and agama, they screwed up the code by commenting out entire blocks of it and (at that time) their bastardized agama let you collect interest infinitely

[30-Jun-18 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
nooooooooooooo... üòÇ so embarrassing

[30-Jun-18 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Sadly, they weren't embarrassed at all, they tried to blame Komodo because it didn't work as expected ü§¶üèø

[30-Jun-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

safecoin is attacking your router right now

[30-Jun-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

They randomly invite/tag me into their shit and then come here bitching because I "keep" responding üòõ

[30-Jun-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's shitcoin tier drama, i wouldn't participate

[30-Jun-18 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
normally, I don't but there's only so much email I can stand when I forget to leave their discord

[30-Jun-18 06:49 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
I just read through all of that, gave me a good laugh, thanks!

can someone check out the checksum for BarterDEX-linux-x64-1.1.0.tar.gz at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/releases ? I keep getting a different sha256sum than the posted one

Thanks @ComputerGenie  , that's what I got too

[30-Jun-18 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think the posted checksums might relate to the initial release of 1.1 that was pulled due to a withdraw issue

[30-Jun-18 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@siu - Chainmakers ?

[30-Jun-18 06:58 PM] SatoriNakamoto#9693

[30-Jun-18 06:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[slack] <sapharic> That's good the free for all period has been removed.     It will bing stability and could attract miners...that's really a great change to my opinion

[01-Jul-18 10:03 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Would profitability increase for miners?

What are all the coins used within Komodo, supernet ecosystem?

[01-Jul-18 02:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
you can see them in Agama wallet - plus button, mostyl BTC clones and KMD assets

[01-Jul-18 02:52 PM] DeMarco#5676
Electrum servers dead? My latest BD update won‚Äôt load any coins...say no electrum.

[01-Jul-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart

[01-Jul-18 02:57 PM] DeMarco#5676
Ok good to know. That‚Äôs due to the recent version change?

[01-Jul-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
correct, this wasn't in earlier releases.
BarterDEX has reached a point where it actually works with "too many" coins.
The current solution seemed the best option, I'm sure that over time it will become more intuitive and "user-friendly"

[01-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
when Hyperdex ?

maybe go to #dex-hyperdex and ask?

What BTC low do you expect before the big bull enters?

[01-Jul-18 07:21 PM] Tyrael#0138
below 5k, this is why they market people should buy at 5000$

[01-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Extradition90#8046
Hi

[01-Jul-18 07:41 PM] Extradition90#8046
Just have a question komodo stays equihash?

[01-Jul-18 07:52 PM] Tyrael#0138
in short, yes

[01-Jul-18 07:53 PM] Extradition90#8046
Ok thanks

[01-Jul-18 07:56 PM] Extradition90#8046
So asic will work on it? I really want to test an asic in my life

[01-Jul-18 07:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
komodo will not be forking

[01-Jul-18 07:56 PM] Extradition90#8046
Ok

[01-Jul-18 07:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I suspect if we forked the algorithm it would be quality of life as is what zcash is doing.

[01-Jul-18 07:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They are forking to be more thermally friendly to gpu and asic miners alike.

[01-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Extradition90#8046
So will be for both ?

[01-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Extradition90#8046
Sorry my english is woths

[01-Jul-18 07:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
well eventually gpu's will be edged out of profitability as more asics come online.

[01-Jul-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
KMD is not going to fork because KMD has no need to fork

[01-Jul-18 07:58 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie come into the hangout channel

[01-Jul-18 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
to paraphrase JL777:
Forking to benefit GPUs over ASICs, logically means we need to fork to favor CPUs over GPUs

[01-Jul-18 08:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
True, but I see nothing wrong with going to a more environmentally friendly version of equihash that will fork neither; just reduce heat output.

[01-Jul-18 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ASICs do that by default

[01-Jul-18 08:00 PM] BlackJesus#6161
True.

[01-Jul-18 08:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
lesss heatput = higher potential clocks = more hashrate :X

[01-Jul-18 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
