[06-Jun-19 07:37 PM] Azzie001#9397
I guess price will drop when we all get funds back

[06-Jun-19 07:40 PM] Azzie001#9397
I mean who gives the right to team to take all the funds

[06-Jun-19 07:43 PM] coyote#8010
No offense Azzie but you are being a fool. The team saw a vulnerability and instead of letting a hacker steal your funds decided to secure them in a safe address

[06-Jun-19 07:43 PM] pinkcookie#4334
@Azzie001 no one gave the team rights to take funds. It was an executive decision to save funds of investors rather than letting hacker take it all.

If the team didn't act, there would be no funds to talk about.

not rly...i get why they did it...and am glade they saved mine our funds

Azzie, a hacker had started stealing coins.   Literally 8M more KMD couldve been stolen by the hacker if they didnt act.

[06-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Literally a ton of people here wouldve been ruined

[06-Jun-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
after analyzing the blockchain, we see that the hacker had indeed started stealing coins an hour before we started sweeping

[06-Jun-19 07:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Every person now submitting a claim and waiting a week to get coins back would instead have had all their coins stolen

[06-Jun-19 07:47 PM] pinkcookie#4334
You can‚Äôt be pissed at them utilizing a known vulnerability to save your money with the intent to return your funds. If the hacker would have taken them all you would not even have that option

[06-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Azzie001#9397
nah i seen mine share of disaster...but this is first time team takes mine coins so hacker wouldnt

[06-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
please do, and go to verge or tron.  you deserve a coin whose dev team has no technical skills, and whose response to a hack like this would be to try to hide that it happened

[06-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we actually took the coins from the hacker as he had the privkeys

[06-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Azzie001#9397
u can buy on other places u dont need mine bag

[06-Jun-19 07:51 PM] Vertigo#0439

@Azzie001  even bitcoin could have gotten hacked with the similar exploit on electrum , so are you calling bitcoin a shitcoin too?

I am just saying this is shitshow

[06-Jun-19 07:55 PM] Azzie001#9397

@Azzie001  I‚Äôm sure you have heard the phrase not your keys not your coins ,  KMD had to make a quick decision to save peoples funds which they worked hard for,  or else they would be gone for good.  As they say when Life hands you lemons ....
