the crypto-sphere these days seems to consist mostly of recent adopters with very little intellectual curiosity about what the implications of what trustless transactions really signify.  There is a paradigm shift underway that sadly, very few recognize. And it's not about lambo's or wall street tomfuckery. It's about freedom. Freedom from the prying eyes of those who wish to control and freedom from usurious payment processors who think they deserve a cut of every transaction in the world. I know I'm preaching to the choir here but I feel like it bears clarification. KMD is at the TOP of the tech tree and has all the tools in place, or under development to usurp the status quo. Been here since 2014. I am constantly researching everything out there and no other project even comes close in terms of innovation.

@WhiteWidow the first comment on that reddit link:
You can't make good products by just having amazing piece of code - you must start with the customer experience (UX) first and then work backwards.

[16-Aug-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
both are needed

[16-Aug-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant have any amazing product without working tech

[16-Aug-18 01:00 PM] shnu#0359
I would add.. both are needed with equal priority.

[16-Aug-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody debates this point

[16-Aug-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the debate is people who want us to spend tens of millions of dollars we dont have to purchase advertising, which doesnt even guarantee it will have any long term benefit

[16-Aug-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the important thing to note is that people who do their research are able to identify KMD as one of the leaders

[16-Aug-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so we are halfway there

The Great Filter: Why You Shouldn‚Äôt ICO on Ethereum
It‚Äôs an open secret that Ethereum is simply the wrong technology for most of the stuff being built on it. Here, with data from our own at-scale load tests, we show why many high-profile projects will soon fail.

[16-Aug-18 01:14 PM] shnu#0359
I wouldn't spend too much in advertising. But in good design. Design favours ease of use and adoption.
If I were allowed to voice out my opinion, it is definitely worth it to approach a top graphic design company to go through the user interface to produce a top notch minimalistic design of each of kmd products.
I do not intend to question the tech. I vouch for KMD on social platforms.

[16-Aug-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but we have done exactly this

[16-Aug-18 01:15 PM] shnu#0359
