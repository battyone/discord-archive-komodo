There's a youtube interview with the ETC devs and the VBK guys from mid 2017, so yes it's been in development for years

[03-Apr-19 01:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
Not trying to troll, but you guys really should open your mind a little and learn about it, instead of bashing it out of insecurity or whatever it is that makes you do that

[03-Apr-19 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its closed source. case closed 😄

@crunchycat ```"you guys really should open your mind a little and learn about it"```
We tried to but it's closed source.

You should hop on their discord and genuinely ask that question, when open-source?

[03-Apr-19 01:52 AM] crunchycat#0726
It was said they would open source during mainnet, I honestly haven't kept up with the convo there though so not sure if any more info on this was given

[03-Apr-19 01:54 AM] Regnar#6164
```"It has been stated that it will be open source to when it is ready to be open source."```

so veriblock is like a piece of KMD but that one piece isn't as efficient?

[03-Apr-19 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From what I understand they copied dpow but removed the need for trusted notaries... Which means that anyone can just spoof wahtever they like adn notarize bad data

[03-Apr-19 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it doesnt appear to offer any 51% pretectino

[03-Apr-19 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just spams BTC with block hashes

@blackjok3r when moon

[03-Apr-19 01:58 AM] crunchycat#0726
also on open sourcing

[03-Apr-19 01:58 AM] PTYX#6840
or when hack?

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay I can't post a pic here

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why isnt it open source? If it was, I could read its source and undestand how it works

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
without that im just taking their word for it

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which I will not do as it looks scammy as fuck

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] crunchycat#0726
``how can an altcoin chain depend on a close source for consensus level security of their chain
 --> as @shiggidy  pointed out, they won't. It will be open-source by then.``

by when?

[03-Apr-19 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They should open source it before taking everyones money

[03-Apr-19 02:00 AM] PTYX#6840
oh ok THEN it makes sense

[03-Apr-19 02:00 AM] crunchycat#0726
And there are coins that will be implementing VBK shortly, so open source will be very soon

veriblock is a redundant project

[03-Apr-19 02:00 AM] PTYX#6840
it's just strange to watch the cryptocommunity back a closed source coin which is supposed to use an open source network to secure other coins

[03-Apr-19 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we promise this works, give us all your money.... But we wont show you the code... screams scam... anyway I'm going back to work

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] PTYX#6840
it wouldn't have happened a few years back

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] crunchycat#0726
I understand everyone's frustration with it being closed-source, I too have been frustrated by this

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] crunchycat#0726
But I also understand their reasoning, as quite a bit is on the line

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] Llama#1330
but why start a brand new project that is inferior to its competition?

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] crunchycat#0726
So making sure it's rock solid with the mainnet launce before open sourcing makes sense

[03-Apr-19 02:01 AM] PTYX#6840
it's not inferior in their mind surely

[03-Apr-19 02:02 AM] PTYX#6840
@crunchycat that makes no sense

[03-Apr-19 02:02 AM] PTYX#6840
they should open source it in the beta stage

[03-Apr-19 02:02 AM] PTYX#6840
how else do you make sure it's ready for the mainnet?

[03-Apr-19 02:02 AM] crunchycat#0726
It's not inferior, VBK and KMD have meaningful differences.  Depends on what you value.  You guys obviously value the "efficiency" of KMD's approach, VBK values the decentralized aspect of theirs

[03-Apr-19 02:03 AM] PTYX#6840
i want to see how VBK will prevent spamming.

[03-Apr-19 02:03 AM] crunchycat#0726
I won't pretend to know what they're doing behind the scenes, but I'd just about guarantee they covered their bases seeing the backers they have and the funding behind it

[03-Apr-19 02:04 AM] PTYX#6840
time will tell i guess

[03-Apr-19 02:05 AM] crunchycat#0726
Also securing shitcoins isn't their only trick.  Their website also shows "blockchain of custody" for securing data, and atomic txns and the like.  KMD does something like that, right?

[03-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Regnar#6164
honestly @crunchycat you seem pretty chill to come in here and try and defend VBK, but I wouldn't give your own personal guarantee of any project unless you are certain you know what is going on under the hood.

[03-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Regnar#6164
"Just about" * i mean

[03-Apr-19 02:06 AM] crunchycat#0726
^^ 😉

[03-Apr-19 02:10 AM] Regnar#6164
but yea, VBK won't get much love here largely in part because no one knows what it actually does at a code level. We've had probably tens of dozens of other project devs come in here and talk with us about their projects, code, ideas, etc. and people fork one another and build.

[03-Apr-19 02:13 AM] PTYX#6840
There's a big possibility that when VBK is open sourced, someone will copy it and improve it

[03-Apr-19 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what happens to all the moeny they got?

[03-Apr-19 02:14 AM] PTYX#6840
probably by notarizing to komodo lol

[03-Apr-19 02:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
"We will open source it one day" is an old trick used by evil people in the free software and open source world. I have been around this block a few more times than most.

[03-Apr-19 02:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
yeah I imagine someone will copy it when they do open source

[03-Apr-19 02:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
I also think they prob have other stuff up their sleeves and won't release the code to the public until they implement said stuff

[03-Apr-19 02:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
will just have to wait and see

[03-Apr-19 02:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD folk just code and push to prod, we don't wait for the future, we build it and have it running in prod for 3 years already

[03-Apr-19 02:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@crunchycat you seem like a shill that wants people to buy VBK to dump your bags on them. Your "guarantees" have no value. You don't seem to understand the Bitcoin mempool or why VBK poisoning a collective well with their garbage that doesn't work is a bad thing

[03-Apr-19 02:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
@crunchycat no here cares about vbk. why do you keep bringing it up?

[03-Apr-19 02:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
apparently no one can buy it anyway so why are you shilling it?

[03-Apr-19 02:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
In other news, water is still wet, and KMD DPoW still protects dozens of coins in production from actual 51% attacks and double spend attacks, not *pretend* attack solutions that might work one day that might be open sourced.

[03-Apr-19 02:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
VBK is so poorly designed as to be a bad joke, that is really the cherry on top

[03-Apr-19 02:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
@dukeleto no guarantees were ever made

[03-Apr-19 02:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was thinking about what he said before "the people it has backing and funding it" maybe the whole thing is simply a tactic to break BTC by filling its mempool... There are a LOT of people out there wwith unlimited money

[03-Apr-19 02:41 AM] crunchycat#0726
in other news, wtf ever happened with that story about the little league money you wouldn't return to the moms?

notice the word `guarantee`

[03-Apr-19 02:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
VBK shills need not apply to the moral high ground

[03-Apr-19 02:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a bit gauche

[03-Apr-19 02:42 AM] crunchycat#0726
dudes that shaft little leagues for funds need not apply

[03-Apr-19 02:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
sad that we can't talk about technical topics like 51% attacks that investors are promised

[03-Apr-19 02:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
what about those poor orphan blocks?

[03-Apr-19 02:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
KMD must be really threatening to someone to merit this kind of harassment

[03-Apr-19 02:43 AM] crunchycat#0726
we were having a decent convo until douche mcdouchebag came up in here attacking me

[03-Apr-19 02:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
also he never addressed the point about the little league money, just chooses to "no comment" on that

[03-Apr-19 02:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
so who has the moral high ground

[03-Apr-19 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@crunchycat are you a paid troll?

[03-Apr-19 02:49 AM] crunchycat#0726
that's all you got?

[03-Apr-19 02:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well how "decentralized" was that ieo when less than 400 people actually were able to buy any vbk. You are ether a sad, sad person or some kind of weird agent of disinfo. I jsut wish you would leave everyone alone

[03-Apr-19 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
they made bots buy it up to make it look like it wasn't a total flop, waiting for another pump....
