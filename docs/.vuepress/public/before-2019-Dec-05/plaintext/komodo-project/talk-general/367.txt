any whitehat finding a way to recover is by law allowed to keep funds without any harm

@jl777c Help, I can't send my smart dust from my old address to my new KMD address. In the new Verus wallet it says balance is equal to or less than the transaction fee of 10000 and no extra funds are available for fee. It also says Invalid pub address. I must be doing something wrong. Would someone mind giving me a hand? I've received the smart dust and verified my funds were captured by the team, but don't know best approach to fix the above.

[15-Jun-19 01:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@Kobuzzal is the coin chips?

[15-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
No, just KMD I think

[15-Jun-19 01:51 PM] gcharang#6833
`Invalid pub address` - check the receiving address if it is correct and not missing a letter

[15-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Not sure, I'm a low level user as far as knowledge on functionality goes. It has 34 characters.

[15-Jun-19 01:52 PM] gcharang#6833
` balance is equal to or less than the transaction fee of 10000 and no extra funds are available for fee.` - just send 0.0001 and ignore the message, the transaction will go through

[15-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Hmmm, I tried sending .0001 and I get the same message

[15-Jun-19 01:53 PM] gcharang#6833
@Kobuzzal dm me the old address please

[15-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Kobuzzal#9341
Can I post the address here and see if anyone else can send .0001 to it?

[15-Jun-19 01:54 PM] gcharang#6833
@Kobuzzal I have sent a message to you

[15-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Kobuzzal#9341

Any idea when binance will open withdrawals? I sent my KMD there to protect them during the issue and they‚Äôre still there

[15-Jun-19 06:56 PM] jonnybbig#2316
I don‚Äôt want binance to block me bc I‚Äôm in the US and KMD stuck, lol

[15-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Alecandro#1179
I think you have over 90 days before they stop trading for US but you can still withdraw after that regardless. That‚Äôs what I read, but obviously I understand that completely

in any case KMD is compliant even for USSA trading as it is still on bittrex

[15-Jun-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810

[15-Jun-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
last i checked it was a bit under 5%, like 4.8%

[15-Jun-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
including all mining and rewards, as a lot of the supply isnt collecting rewards regularly

[15-Jun-19 09:11 PM] crumb#2550
thank you james!

[15-Jun-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this means users that are diligently collecting rewards have a negative inflation rate

everyone If you have submitted a claim and didn't receive your funds back yet, please check your compromised address for some smartdust funds which you should send to the refund address you specified in your claim. If you haven't done it yet, please do so as this is a required step to receive your funds back quickly. If you didn't submit your claim yet, please do so ASAP. Currently we are processing refunds for correct and accurate claims daily and a lot of funds been refunded. Soon, we will be processing refunds weekly basis. If you need to claim, please use the forms above. Please don't resubmit same claims again and again as it will delay processing. Submit claims only once for each coin/address (if you haven't done it yet). Thanks for being an amazing community.
