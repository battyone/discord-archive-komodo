if this can repeated for a number of blocks, prob crash their implementation forever

what about the bug or flaw or exploit he claims to have found?
has anyone done the nitty gritty and checked on the validity of his claims?

ABC added a checkpoint, sort of a manual dPoW

[16-Nov-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
now, if SV was mining a private ABC chain, they would need to start over

[16-Nov-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW saves a lot of hassle as it would automatically add a new checkpoint without having to update the version live in the field

Hi @jl777c , I enquired about 5 months ago about notarization for cryptonight altcoins, and it was not possible then.
Is the notarization service now available for cryptonight coins?
If not, will it be available in the future?

[16-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I know that @dukeleto is looking for a cryptonite coin to work with. it is a different codebase, so best would be a project that has knowledeable devs to add checkpoints during runtime

[16-Nov-18 12:10 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

@cryptotron DPoW on a CN/XMR codebase is supported/possible, it's just it's a lot more work than adding a BTC/LTC/ZEC fork. Once the first coin like this is supported, others will be much easier. I have talked to a few coins that are interested, but nobody has fully committed yet

[16-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Godballz#9524
What is this 5% return thing I've heard about? Has this always been around and would I need a wallet on my pc rather than coinomi cause I don't think they give interest..

[16-Nov-18 02:10 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[16-Nov-18 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Godballz move your KMD funds once per month, you will get 5% interested on those funds, via a reduced/positive transaction fee (which doubles as interest)

[16-Nov-18 02:12 PM] Godballz#9524
Huh that's odd. So move the entire balance?

[16-Nov-18 02:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Easiest way to spend all the utxo

[16-Nov-18 02:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just send whole balance to your self

[16-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Godballz#9524
Wow cool. So I can just do that right now back to myself on coinomi and it will return with more? And that can be done like once a month?

[16-Nov-18 03:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Do it in Agama ,  I'm not sure coinomi supports the interest mechanism

[16-Nov-18 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
they are external project that made an assetchain coin

[16-Nov-18 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
@CLoWn PIARTE is a community created coin. not done by the Komodo official team. you can find more info in #pirate

Ty!

[16-Nov-18 05:25 PM] yorklab#7270
Capital's website is also gone, so it looks like they skipped town. They claimed to have taken in over $12 million for the ICO.

[16-Nov-18 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it does seem the project is closed...

[16-Nov-18 05:44 PM] yorklab#7270
I was just contacted by Capital Technologies Project Lead, and apparently what was stated on the website about the 12 million dollars was not true. He says nobody actually invested in the Ico and that he was trying to get this project off the ground in hopes of gaining more interest and developers but it never happened, so he's just simply closed everything down. Apparently all the swaps from ethereum to Capital-Technologie's token were from bounty hunters not from people who invested in the Ico.
