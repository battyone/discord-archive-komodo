Please tell us about the "Obsidian dragon"
What should I do and for whom is this update?

Hi im new to kmd but i think its just awesome. Atomic swap >= ‚Ç¨$¬•> . How KMD will evolved and get value with this awesome wallet?

[01-Dec-19 10:57 AM] Toxicface#6028
Exemple, does it gonna cost exemple 1K KMD to be on this wallet as a coin/token or is there a fee somewhere?

[01-Dec-19 11:02 AM] Toxicface#6028
What bring + value to kmd in this wallet?

[01-Dec-19 11:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
all the fees generated from trading will be converted to KMD to pay holders of assets

[01-Dec-19 11:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
more trades = more KMD demands

[01-Dec-19 11:07 AM] Toxicface#6028
Thnx and how people should get interest and want to have kmd if atomic swap is there

[01-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Toxicface#6028
Kmd is not needed but the wallet yes

[01-Dec-19 11:08 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
there is also a 10% discount in trading fees if you trade using KMD

[01-Dec-19 11:10 AM] Toxicface#6028
Is it what we call centralized if you send atomic swap but someone take a fee like a bank?

[01-Dec-19 11:11 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
when you send coin from one address to another address, and there is network fees, is that centralized?

Thx it was not fud but trying to understand what is behind. And why i should invest or not

[01-Dec-19 11:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The trade is executed using smart contract. No other third party is involved.

[01-Dec-19 11:19 AM] Toxicface#6028
Last questions if i dont like to put my coins in a walllet, is a ledger can be use

[01-Dec-19 11:21 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not sure what you are asking.

[01-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Coins are always stored in wallet address.

[01-Dec-19 11:22 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and you access that using private key or wallet.dat

[01-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If you don't want to put coin in a wallet then I think you can just send it to another wallet.

[01-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
ledger is also a wallet.

[01-Dec-19 11:25 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So essentially if you send your coin to ledger then you will put your coin in the ledger wallet.

[01-Dec-19 11:28 AM] Toxicface#6028
Yes my questions was more if i use a ledger is there a web platform so i always keep my coins there and not on the komodo wallet

[01-Dec-19 11:29 AM] Toxicface#6028
To do the swap a kind of third party ledger ü§£

[01-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe some of the moderators can give you update on this. I have not used ledger for a long time.

@grewalsatinder Lol I saw u liked my vtc 51%

[03-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Let me ask you a question.
Why does VTC think like this,
```The benefit isn't worth the cost of becoming centralized to KMD's approvals and BTC's chain.  There hasn't been a desire to wed VTC to the security of other chains, and to stay a free-standing crypto.  Doing so would remove the need for VTC to exist at all.```

[03-Dec-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
lack of technical understanding

[03-Dec-19 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
this is like saying there is no need for a website if they have 2FA

[03-Dec-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
securing something via any means possible doesnt mean what you are securing has no point, unless its point is adding security for other blockchains.

[03-Dec-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
also it is not centralized as they are decentralized checkpoints

[03-Dec-19 09:54 AM] alperC#7758
imo, these ratings are so biased even if they say the opposite. For example, Cosmos - they rated their Technology with 'Excellent' and Komodos Technology 'Fair', for what reason? On what basis was this decision taken? They also include market data in their rating, and no project can influence the market performance.
