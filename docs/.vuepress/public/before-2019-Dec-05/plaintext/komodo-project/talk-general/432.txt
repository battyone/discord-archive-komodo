after 3 years involved in crypto I begin to believe with certainty that 99% of dev or ceo are thieves, yes they are thieves, they do not have a correct work code, either they or politicians or those in finance all are the same, the more respect I have for a hacker than for these worthless people who write some meaningless WP, there is no common interest but only personal, almost all are rotten and when you hear them at conferences they are illiterate trying to explain the solution they found, even so stupid they consider us, I rep repeat myself ,komodo may not change my financial life but it definitely taught me how to grow my boy and how rotten the public system and government are,Well done gents

@gigamesh name of the technology project and the funds asset name been same. SuperNET.

[14-Sep-19 10:08 AM] gigamesh#3544
@grewalsatinder so its always been a tech as well as a sort of investment fund?

[14-Sep-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
SuperNET was the tech and the philosophy behind bringing all the chains together to create a super network with each contributing its best attributes @gigamesh

[14-Sep-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
In order to do that, it collected other coins/assets along the way to make sure it had a vested interest but when NXT decided to kill off their chain, Komodo was born. SuperNET holders are the original BTCD then KMD holders and both coin/asset shares the same tech to achieve the same goals.

[14-Sep-19 11:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
As of right now, SuperNET has taken on more of a investment fund.

[14-Sep-19 11:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is how i see it.

[14-Sep-19 11:45 AM] cascrypto#8206
supernet is the sleeping giant, no volume no love, that will change ones divided starts to flow through the komodo ecosystem.

Same goes for msharkfund just a big bag of kmd and supernet

[16-Sep-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in December update of KMD blockchain zk-SNARK transactions were disabled on KMD blockchain.

[16-Sep-19 09:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from that blockchain update, KMD is public only transactions blockchain

[16-Sep-19 09:57 AM] Bitcoin Benny#9597
There were strong indications that exchanges would move in this direction and the timing with the US traders etc makes sense.  The December update was valuable

PirateChain (ARRR) | Secure, Private & Anonymous Cryptocurrency
Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a 100% private send cryptocurrency. It uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users activity on the network.

it will be a LONG time before the govts change any regulations about privacy coins anyway

Since we are not private anymore @jl777c can we be listed on coinbase or us exchange like binance us ?

[17-Sep-19 07:20 AM] ca333#0118
speaking legally there is no reason for KMD to not get listed on CEX like coinbase or BNB US - shielded transactions would have been such a reason @Slyris

[17-Sep-19 07:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, but is someone talking to them ?

[17-Sep-19 08:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Coinbase we reached out to awhile back but lead went cold.  BNB US I believe Steve reached out when it was first announced

[17-Sep-19 10:37 AM] Regnar#6164
They have been asking for additional coin suggestions ("asking" which is probably just them trying to pump their twitter likes and activity) but still worth a shot if we haven't made any progress on the private channels.

@polycryptoblog i pinged an acquintance from coinbase

[17-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think the issue with Coinbase was that we didn't have a US-based legal entity, which iirc was a requirement at that time

[17-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Daniel CP#2020
This was probably a year ago now, not sure where things would stand now

[17-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Coinbase can just dont list in coinbase.us then

[17-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Slyris#2880
But keep it for the rest of countries

[17-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Slyris#2880
They unlisted zcash in UK recently

[17-Sep-19 11:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I can't say whether or not that's possible. I'm just saying what they told us a year ago when we tried to get listed

[17-Sep-19 11:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
afaik coinbase uk is a different entity than coinbase us

[17-Sep-19 11:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
not sure how good it is though with all those high fees

[17-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think the vast majority of Coinbase's users are US-based

[17-Sep-19 11:26 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So even if we got listed on the UK version (but not the US version) it might not have a huge impact

[17-Sep-19 11:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
With Binance closing to US customers and only allowing them to trade on Binance US, the real goal would be to make KMD more available to people in the US

There are very few major companies using blockchain right now and the ones that are, aren't really using blockchain. THey're using private DLTs with HyperLedger and/or IBM

[17-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think over time we will see a lot more adoption, inlcuding with Komodos tech. But I think it's a bit early to start saying KMD is dead because no major companies are using it

[17-Sep-19 11:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
big companies are reluctant to adopt new tech for a variety a reasons.. ffs, big banks still use codebase that's 30 years old and the cost to maintain that is a lot higher than it would be to upgrade it but they don't because change

I mentioned it a while back but seems relevant to this talk, we should see how well our RPCs and software works with IoT devices. I know there has been some full node advances on small devices, and nSPV is advancing. We could push some of these types of docs to Zerynth, Particle, and some others that provide IoT hardware/software/middleware.

It's hard for us to imagine every use case but might be better for IoT devs to see our docs in their channels
