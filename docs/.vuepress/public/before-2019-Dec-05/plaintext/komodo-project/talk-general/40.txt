My concern is sometimes people are busy working away in corners of Komodo's ecosystem and we need to reach in there sometimes with news otherwise they may not get it.

I'll try to keep it to a minimum and only big news :think:

[07-Aug-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@benohanlon one cannot disable in-app notifications (the little red message indicator) that a new message has been posted without muting every channel and never getting told that any messages arrive
I get that marketing is small amount of staff, but do they really need to spam regular users in multiple channels and then retag those same users with the same message with an `everyone` in announcements? Point being: If you plan on doing an #officialüì¢ tag of `everyone`, then every multi-channel post of that **same** message becomes annoying spam

[07-Aug-18 01:28 PM] benohanlon#1119
Here's how to mute a single channel @ComputerGenie https://benohanlon.tinytake.com/sf/MjgyMDg1MF84NDY5NTcw.

[07-Aug-18 01:29 PM] benohanlon#1119
How often do you think this is happening @ComputerGenie?

[07-Aug-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@benohanlon Why does it seem so difficult for you to understand that muting **one** channel doesn't help when you go channel surfing and repost **the same message** in **multiple** channels?
`How often do you think this is happening`
**You**, literally, did it just yesterday!

[07-Aug-18 01:32 PM] benohanlon#1119
@ComputerGenie what I mean is how frequently are you coming across this problem a day?
- less than once?
- once a day?
- more than once a day?

[07-Aug-18 01:33 PM] dan.#2473
details aside, i think it's more meaningful if the announcements stay in announcements (unless huge..), and maybe another channel named announcements-discussion for, discussion as applicable

[07-Aug-18 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
We get so much spam reposts about so many things, it's hard to keep track of the actual frequency of when staff does it, but the point remains:
once ever is too frequent

[07-Aug-18 01:35 PM] benohanlon#1119
I disagree with you @ComputerGenie if you're arguing that once ever is too much.

I've scrolled back through announcements and there's on average one or two a day - of which not even half use 'everyone'.

[07-Aug-18 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@benohanlon you're wrong

[07-Aug-18 01:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
I've said earlier in this discussion I'll reduce the use of 'everyone' outside of announcements, keep it to a min and save for big news.

[07-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Cryptick#1291
So I am checking out the Barter Dex for the first time. I am very familiar with BitShares, but just downloaded the Barter Dex.  I am not seeing and volume, chart activity and past transactions. Is there some common error that could be keeping me from seeing this?

[07-Aug-18 01:38 PM] benohanlon#1119
@ComputerGenie it's OK if you disagree with me. I can't force you to be right.

OK I can try that one... About how many trades per hour take place?  (just a ballpark number...)

[07-Aug-18 01:57 PM] Cryptick#1291
Well market making is sort of what I was interested in doing... trading back and forth and making small profits. But the question is how many other traders are out there. Is it worth it?

[07-Aug-18 02:01 PM] pablomp#1061

OK so I have the HyperDex installed....

[07-Aug-18 05:00 PM] Cryptick#1291
Is there some way to see all the past swaps that took place... I realize this is a Dex -so inherently decentralized- but as a person who trades one like to see the volume and activity in any market... It helps you know what is a fair price. Is that data located somewhere?

It looks like they exchange is working, but there is not a significant number of people here to trade with...

[07-Aug-18 05:14 PM] Cryptick#1291
That is with about 20 transactions over the each of the last three days...

if you are interested to be an LP, you can help with liquidity

[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Cryptick#1291
LP?

[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
liquidity provider

[07-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Cryptick#1291
I have done that elsewhere, but as of right now there is no one to sell too.  I like the concept and I could see where it could take off as it provides an alternative to exchange where you do not need to trust the other person.  But this is a little too early for me. I will check back in on the project  once in a while and see if there is more trading.

[07-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
sounds good, It is definitely taking some learning curve. üòÅ

[07-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Cryptick#1291
Well yeah... it does. You guys are going to need a marketing plan. I downloaded like three different wallets watched a number of videos. I guess I realized early on you might be a small community. But I was thinking there would be more than 20 transactions a day...

[07-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Cryptick#1291
I appreciate that there is not wash trading going on to fake volume. But it would appear you guys need a marketing plan...

[07-Aug-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to be 500 tx per day or so

[07-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Cryptick#1291
Yeah, where did everyone go?

[07-Aug-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but I stopped actively making markets as I have been too busy

[07-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Cryptick#1291
I looked at the Coin market cap and you guys have 161 Million dollars market cap. With only a few transactions a day... you guys are potentially dead. Now this could change if something happens. The technology is cool, but a little complicated. i hate to jump into someone elses project and complain or gripe, but this could be a real challenge!

I believe we can see short term growth by improving the technology we already have which is Agama desktop and mobile. I've always thought the wallet is the main tool that facilitates growth.

DEX is just one part of KMD

[07-Aug-18 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD existed before DEX

[07-Aug-18 05:37 PM] PTYX#6840
HyperDex looks and works well but it's difficult to setup and maintain LPs. An LP dashboard would help with liquidity but i would focus on the wallet first.

[07-Aug-18 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD itself has quite a few transactions a day

even without very active DEX, KMD is actively used. with an active DEX, then usages will increase even more

[07-Aug-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so KMD is in no danger, regardless of what happens to DEX. as far as increasing DEX liquidity, we are iterating on the tech to make it easier to use and create liquidity

Probably notarizations

@jl777c  @PTYX  to promote DEX - would that be possible to have a swap lottery? meaning every MIN_INT + RAND_INT swaps there would be an award of  RAND_X [KMD] . But make sense only if it will be promoted/marketed and there will be enough awards to attract many people ... Maybe and idea for hyperdex or sth ? Kind of smart contract or sth

[07-Aug-18 07:25 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
there could be loteries on some celebrations like BTC network anniwersary started, KMD started and some other meaningful

[07-Aug-18 07:25 PM] PTYX#6840
It would only attract people short term but it's definitely possible.

[07-Aug-18 07:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
the thing is to break the wall, once learned you have less resisntance to come back

[07-Aug-18 07:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
assum y% of people comming back maybe just 5% maybe 20%

[07-Aug-18 07:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this could also be measured

[07-Aug-18 07:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and then evaluated if make sense to repeat -> marketing idea

[07-Aug-18 07:27 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but to start - some few things must be done right way -> many ways to make it useless/no results / little ways of doing that correctly

[07-Aug-18 07:29 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
actually this is what you do many times in marketing - giving sth for free to attract users, then build revenue on the user base
