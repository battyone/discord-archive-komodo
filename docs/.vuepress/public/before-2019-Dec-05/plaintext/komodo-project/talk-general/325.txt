Thanks, yes, they got my supernet as well.

[05-Jun-19 07:14 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Not going to fill out a claim form for 1 REV, I bought these assets when they were still on NXT.

[05-Jun-19 07:16 PM] agnewpickens#7393
What address can I use to send Supernet claim to?  Can I use the KMD address generated by Ocean QT?

[05-Jun-19 07:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@agnewpickens yes

[05-Jun-19 07:16 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Thx much, I will fill out the form then.

can I fill in diffrent claim addresses for different assets?

[05-Jun-19 07:25 PM] sergjiev#7907
@gcharang thx for answering all these questions. I'll get to my windows agama wallet this evening, I only used KMD native mode and have not opened it probably in a month. Should I open/sync and see if my balance is still there then proceed to transfer to a safe wallet or file a claim if lost, or is there a safer option?

[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] gcharang#6833
@sergjiev don't open agama at all
follow https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000027990-install-komodo-ocean-wallet-on-windows and sync the chain in that wallet

[05-Jun-19 07:28 PM] gcharang#6833
@sergjiev after syncing the chain,  follow that https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/429676282196787200/585896886481977349 and instead of from old seed, send from native mode to that new address created in verus agama

[05-Jun-19 07:29 PM] cryptojace#7102
Cant see my KMD in Agama lite but can see on blockchain explorer. Getting 'error unknown message' in wallet

[05-Jun-19 07:30 PM] cryptojace#7102
It's not working at the moment?

[05-Jun-19 07:31 PM] Edward#3177
So what was the technical difference that made Verus unaffected with Agama?

[05-Jun-19 07:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptojace KMD version of agama is compromised, please follow  instructions at: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/429676282196787200/585896886481977349

[05-Jun-19 07:33 PM] cryptojace#7102
@gcharang download the versus agama wallet? Or ocean wallet? Can I access the coins on my agama lite wallet from within ocean wallet?

[05-Jun-19 07:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptojace ocean is native wallet
verus agama is secure

[05-Jun-19 07:35 PM] cryptojace#7102
So either is fine?

[05-Jun-19 07:35 PM] gcharang#6833
native means it needs to download the blockchain, if you fine with that and you know what you are doing, then it is fine

[05-Jun-19 07:36 PM] cryptojace#7102
Ah yes. Ok will use the verus agama. Cheers

[05-Jun-19 07:36 PM] madjester#0881
If my funds dont show on dexstats am I hosed?

[05-Jun-19 07:37 PM] joe2x4#5987
Is Komodo paperwallet generator ok to use, didn't see it listed on alert instructions?

[05-Jun-19 07:38 PM] wl#4107
when will I get my KMD back???

[05-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody needs to fill out the form

[05-Jun-19 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
then and only then can we make a sane plan

[05-Jun-19 07:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@madjester dm me the address or check the address on kmdexplorer.io if the address was swept by the team, then they are safe

[05-Jun-19 07:42 PM] madjester#0881
They don't seem to be...

[05-Jun-19 07:43 PM] madjester#0881
nvm, I think they were

[05-Jun-19 07:46 PM] gcharang#6833
dm the address to confirm. if you were able to find the details, fill out the form

[05-Jun-19 07:47 PM] taco#7800
Anyone know if revs and jumblr have any use/value still. Should I get them off agama ?

[05-Jun-19 07:48 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes move them

[05-Jun-19 07:48 PM] taco#7800
@Alexfrog is ocean the only option for them?

[05-Jun-19 07:49 PM] costa2439#3771
@jl777c  Have the assets been attacked ?, or komodo and btc only

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
all coins

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@costa2439 the team swept kmd and btc where they could but the other assets are also at risk, if we couldn't get to them you have to secure them

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Alexfrog#1338
the Verus version of agama does not have the vulnerability

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo agama was targeted

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
verus agama is ok

[05-Jun-19 07:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@taco 
For Lite mode users:
https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview download that
it is safe
first create a new wallet (new seed)
note down the address
then import the old seed, send all funds to the new address
if "electrum error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/

For me any version older than the 3.4 version of agama was only giving me the connection error.

[05-Jun-19 07:54 PM] cryptojace#7102
@gcharang sorry how do I import old seed into new versus agama?

[05-Jun-19 07:54 PM] cryptojace#7102

[05-Jun-19 07:57 PM] cryptojace#7102
No worries worked it out

@gcharang can I also use verus agama to move my ARRR into?

[05-Jun-19 08:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptojace I am not really sure but there are people answering qstns here: https://discord.gg/WecyK5

[05-Jun-19 08:03 PM] sergjiev#7907
@gcharang thank you!!

[05-Jun-19 08:03 PM] cryptojace#7102
@gcharang cheers

[05-Jun-19 08:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
@cryptojace yes you can

[05-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Laban#8836
Hi, terrible news guys. But good that you caught it earlier then hackers I guess.
But you now showed that the team has the possibility move anyone’s funds right?

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] cryptojace#7102
@gcharang I can send direct from Verus agama to nano ledger right?

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] cryptojace#7102
And thanks for all the help!

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Ludom#5832
No they cant move anyone's funds

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] madjester#0881

👀 

[05-Jun-19 08:05 PM] Ludom#5832
Just the funds of the compromised addresses

[05-Jun-19 08:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@cryptojace yes
please be sure you haven't entered the ledger seed in the old Komodo agama wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@Laban there was a vulnerability
before the hacker used it
the team used it to secure the funds

[05-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Laban#8836
Oh, so they moved it using the hack, not their authority?

[05-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Ludom#5832
yes

[05-Jun-19 08:07 PM] gcharang#6833
yes using the hack in a npm library used by agama
the blockchain is secure as ever

[05-Jun-19 08:08 PM] Laban#8836
Oh, phew, I’ve been interesting in Komodo the last few days. And this made me think that the project was super centralized

[05-Jun-19 08:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
no

[05-Jun-19 08:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
the team just raced the attacker

[05-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Laban#8836
Alright, good job then :)
I was ready to sell my full stack if the exchanges wallets weren’t disabled.

[05-Jun-19 08:11 PM] Ludom#5832
No the project is not centralized not at all

[05-Jun-19 08:11 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how soon is this going to be fixed?

[05-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Ludom#5832
Less than a lot of others crypto with bigger market cap

[05-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Ludom#5832
And this crisis shows excatly how decentrlized is Komodo

[05-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Laban#8836
Oh, I’m sure, top10 is filled with very silly databases posings as blockchain

[05-Jun-19 08:12 PM] costa2439#3771
Is this address from the team?R9JCEd6xnCxNUSpLrHEWvzPSh7CNXm7z75

[05-Jun-19 08:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
@costa2439 DM me your address

[05-Jun-19 08:14 PM] costa2439#3771
no, if it's a dev address

[05-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Laban#8836
After reading about it for a bit I really like the tech of Komodo, 
I just hope for some marketing. Tech doesn’t mean anything if newcomers doesn’t hear about it

[05-Jun-19 08:16 PM] gcharang#6833

[05-Jun-19 08:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
if it was in agama no

[05-Jun-19 08:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
move funds

[05-Jun-19 08:17 PM] gcharang#6833

Did DAO killed Ethereum?

[05-Jun-19 08:23 PM] QuadraQ#5617
So I can't use Agama wallet until it's been patched is that the situation?

[05-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Ludom#5832
And they rolled back 💩

[05-Jun-19 08:24 PM] QuadraQ#5617
I understand I need to create a new address and send all funds to that address. But Agama can't be trusted to create or use the new address, correct?

[05-Jun-19 08:24 PM] ѕℓιм#1031
correct @QuadraQ

[05-Jun-19 08:24 PM] Ludom#5832
