there are continually small and sometimes large improvements with each DPoW integration, and they flow back to other coins using dpow

`oh, I am trusted now? How did that happen?`
Completely by accident :trollface:

[17-Oct-18 07:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
for example: James helped me improve the DPoW code, so it automatically generates some things that used to require a very painful manual entering of data (all 64 notary addresses that correspond to their pubkeys). HUSH and EMC2 have this, and when CHIPS + GAME do their yearly hardfork to upgrade notaries, they can easily pull in that change, which makes maintaining the external coin that adds DPoW much easier

Currently used by CHIPS, GAME, HUSH and most recently EMC2 that just defended against a 51% attack today. Any small hashrate PoW coin is currently an easy target for 51% + ...

There is currently a one-time yearly fee of 300 KMD and 300 COIN paid directly to jl777 to cover these costs.

[17-Oct-18 08:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, and even those numbers are old temp figures

[17-Oct-18 08:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
DPoW by it's design, uses transactions and those transactions have fees. That is a built in cost to the algorithm, it's not KMD platform charging for the fun of it

[17-Oct-18 08:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
even so, it's the time it takes to make everything work correctly, that is the most expensive

[17-Oct-18 08:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think he means it relys on that one person to distribute it or ensure its used for fees.

[17-Oct-18 08:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
he's asking about fees, how they're managed, to who, how ensure they're not embezzled

[17-Oct-18 08:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
not sure how it works now, but I see that gateway CC and other improvements could automate this in future

[17-Oct-18 08:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
There will always be that "central point" cos duke and others asist in setting it up. He is trying to say dpow is flawed because "someone" has to distribute the fees to notary nodes. That seems his motive lol

Central notary ledger more like?

[17-Oct-18 08:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
well in future I imagine someone will deposit the coins to a gateway for that coin and CC ensure they're only used for their purpose. No need to manually distribute. Ehi for what it matters...

[18-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Hermes#6934
Exactly which part you need help with?

[18-Oct-18 01:44 AM] hypocalese#3688
So I'm trying to add an AssetChain I created to Agama wallet.

[18-Oct-18 01:44 AM] hypocalese#3688
I've been at it for a few hours and not sure I get it.

[18-Oct-18 01:47 AM] Hermes#6934
That would be with Pbca , have you send a request through github? Already have your electrum server?

[18-Oct-18 01:48 AM] hypocalese#3688
No Electrum, the documentation says its optional.

[18-Oct-18 01:52 AM] hypocalese#3688
Perhaps I'm going at it the wrong way.  I'm attempting to edit the Installed windows wallet Agama.

[18-Oct-18 01:53 AM] hypocalese#3688
Do I need to edit the SRC files and rebuild the Agama wallet?

[18-Oct-18 02:24 AM] Hermes#6934
You could do your own version of Agama is open source if that fits your purpose but if you want your coin to be launched in the official wallet then the procedure is as detailed in the page.

[18-Oct-18 02:33 AM] hypocalese#3688
its not simple

[18-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Hermes#6934
If you can please send us a ticket at support@komodoplatform.com  and let us know in which part you need and our devs will look into it as soon as they can @hypocalese

@Hermes  Going through the Agama Desktop App instructions.  In windows, wget is a needed package. I'm sure its not an issue in Linux.
