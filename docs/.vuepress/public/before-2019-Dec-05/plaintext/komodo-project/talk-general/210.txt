I like that game rogue and i think it‚Äôs great but we need to have some modern games to be an example and not some command line floppy disk game

[15-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just curious...are there any projects like crypto kitties built with kmd?

[15-Feb-19 05:21 PM] Steve Lee#1967
yea the point is to build proof of concepts, and then open it up to the devs themselves to work with us to build out more functionality where blockchain can actually provide value

AFAIK Cryptofist is working on many avenues for options like the above.

komodo has to focus on the  "backend".  They re not game devs... What we need is just a PoC...

[15-Feb-19 05:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Decentraland like kmd project would be really interesting

[15-Feb-19 05:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Rogue was intially a project JL made to see if he could add Blockchain to an ancient game.  He did, now it will serve as a PoC for CC Blockchain games and how they can add additional layers to gamification, trading, and verifications of gameplay.

[15-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Looking over how each aspect works with Rogue CC and thinking of possible uses is really quite fun.  I can not wait til many users can easily test it all out and see what a handful of us see.

[15-Feb-19 05:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
What's really important is getting tools for game devs made, then they can come to KMD and add chains to their games.

[15-Feb-19 05:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like a sdk?

[15-Feb-19 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
However I still don‚Äôt see a use case for blockchain which is a public ledger to be applied to a game

[15-Feb-19 05:43 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
Look.. What everyone thinks is that a modern graphics game should bring more value to their coins... And yes. for sure.. the kmd is going to pump if the team announce that a modern graphics game is using komodos tech and blah blah... And after one month an other coin will do the same and kmd will be forgotten.... But the actual value is to make the industry use your technology...that brings the best value to the project and to our coins...

An SDK. I think so or something similar, I'm not exactly sure I'm qualified to answer that question with any sense of knowledgeable authority üòâ

[15-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
JL stated that the point of using Rogue was to help people focus on the underlying tech and it's use instead of being distracted by graphics.

the playerdata is a nonfungible token

[15-Feb-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
tradeable via the asset CC DEX functions

[15-Feb-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the playerdata is immune from cheats and fake data as it is verified

[15-Feb-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
people asked for a nonfungible token based game for komodo

[15-Feb-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
now we have one, which happens to have gameplay, ingame gold to real coin conversion and multiplayer mode

[15-Feb-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it isnt starcraft 2, but again after 2 weeks from starting what exactly is a reasonable expectation?

[15-Feb-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
we shouldnt try to become gamedevs

[15-Feb-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
we should help existing gamedevs blockchain their gamese

[15-Feb-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
to do that they need to see a reference implementation

[15-Feb-19 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE is such

[15-Feb-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
with minimal clutter of the actual game, they can see clearly what they need to do in order to blockchain their game

[15-Feb-19 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are disappointed at a 1980s ascii based game,well, it does add new features to rogue that were never possible before and it is arguably the most advanced game that allows users to create and trade nonfungible tokens, in addition to have tournaments

[15-Feb-19 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
it showcases how in-game currency (and items) can be powered by KMD tech, where KMD has done all the really hard/boring/annoying code to make things work, and you, the game dev, get to focus on your game mechanics, while benefiting from all the KMD tech underneath

[15-Feb-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
also, just a "game", is a 100's billions per year industry bigger than most other industries.

[15-Feb-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if that isnt a strong step toward mainstream usage,what is better?

[15-Feb-19 06:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
games might just be the thing that makes blockchains used by the masses, not "real life" payments. Nobody knows

[15-Feb-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
The infrastructure is already there for the 100 billion industry.

[15-Feb-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
having a cheatproof gaming allows for competitions that are fair. it is not clear all the new things that will be done by blockchain gamedevs

[15-Feb-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems I solve how to blockchain a game, something that many others are struggling to do and you say there is no point to it

[15-Feb-19 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is no point to bitcoin since paypal exists

[15-Feb-19 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
But the application is futile when it comes to games.

[15-Feb-19 06:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
this KMD tech also opens the possibilities of truly decentralized game communities, where no one single company owns all the in-game currency/metadata/etc

That‚Äôs ridiculous

[15-Feb-19 06:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Deleted User  I guess the thing to look at here is this.
Game companies would find reasons for blockchain *even if you wouldn't*. 
Game companies can either:
Get their own blockchain devs  (the largest ones most likely will)
OR use something like Komodo to add blockchain to their games (a very large majority of small dev compainies will most likely do this)

[15-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah explain an 11 year OLD to trade on a DEX

[15-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
A smaller game studio will probably want to make a game with blockchain and advance in popularity because of it, there chance at this would be because of the ease of actually doing it early with the right ideas.

rogue never had a multiplayer competition mode

[15-Feb-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
rogue never had nonfungible and tradable tokens that represent playerdata

[15-Feb-19 06:11 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
i also think that game devs-companies  have losses because of cheats(lucky patcher etc...) and stuff like that, that makes users able to "buy"  their items  free...

[15-Feb-19 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it was never possible to conduct a provably fair rogue tournament

[15-Feb-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
as anybody could just edit the file to make up whatever stats/items they wanted

[15-Feb-19 06:12 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
so i think that every game dev is looking actively for a solution

[15-Feb-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so it might seem like it is no big deal, but it transforms an otherwise unverifiable result to something that is decentralized

[15-Feb-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it wont get mass market traction as it is, but this is after 2 weeks of work

[15-Feb-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is that much closer to the true solution, whatever that might be
