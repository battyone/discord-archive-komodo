**Mining Komodo can be very beneficial for miners. Sometimes they mine blocks with unclaimed rewards in it. What was the biggest block mined in the last 1 year? (amount of KMD in 1 block)**

[14-Dec-18 10:12 PM] PTYX#6840
over 15K KMD

solo miner probably

[14-Dec-18 10:13 PM] PTYX#6840
it was a pool

[14-Dec-18 10:13 PM] PTYX#6840
or a notary i can't remember

[14-Dec-18 10:13 PM] crumb#2550
ahh. ok

[14-Dec-18 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007
that was a pool or solo pool

[14-Dec-18 10:13 PM] Vertigo#0439
Wow

[14-Dec-18 10:14 PM] Vertigo#0439
I guess bittrex forgot to claim

[14-Dec-18 10:14 PM] crumb#2550
that's more that year's worth of regular notary node mining reward

[14-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Speaking of which, seeing how no one has been able to withdraw from an exchange in a month... going to be a nice reward when someone does for a miner.

[14-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Vertigo#0439
So our current reward reset after fork?

[14-Dec-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[14-Dec-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
utxo nLocktimes are not changed by the fork

[14-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Vertigo#0439
Oh cool

[14-Dec-18 10:17 PM] crumb#2550
now that reward accuring stops after one month, those humongous unclaimed rewards will be a thing of the past

[14-Dec-18 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, mostly. maybe in the future, long dormant whales wake up, only then will we see them

[14-Dec-18 10:17 PM] crumb#2550

[14-Dec-18 10:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can order your own CPU ... Like custom built .. its pretty sweet... and almost any hardware instruction (or software for that matter) cna be programmed inot an open source FPGA... so in the end it will be way faster than current CPUs.
