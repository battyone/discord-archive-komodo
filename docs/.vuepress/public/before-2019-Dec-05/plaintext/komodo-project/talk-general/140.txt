Does anyone know why withdrawing pirate coin from digital Price exchange has not been possible for the last 3 to 4 days?

[01-Dec-18 02:17 AM] Alright#0419
@Ziginator people mining directly to exchange deposit address

[01-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Ziginator#8731
I bought some ARRR and I cant get it off the exchange into my Agama wallet. I dont want to buy more until I am sure I can get my purchased coins off the exchange

[01-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Hermes#6934
@Ziginator  did you mined  directly into the exchange address ?

[01-Dec-18 03:25 AM] Ziginator#8731
No , I send BTC into the exchange and bought ARRR.  For the last 4 days  the exchange has this message when I try to send  out my coins "Withdrawal temporary disabled for this coin
Maintenance

[01-Dec-18 03:27 AM] Ziginator#8731
I like what I have read about ARRR and wanted to buy some. Digital Price is the only exchange that has a trading pair.

[01-Dec-18 03:29 AM] Hexanite#6957
All exchanges are locked for KMD now. Why is that and when will it open up?

[01-Dec-18 03:37 AM] Ziginator#8731
Digital Price allows withdrawal of KMD but not ARRR. I guess I will wait it out. Nevertheless, it makes me a little worried.

[01-Dec-18 03:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Hexanite  big upgrade coming soon making sure everything goes right

[01-Dec-18 03:42 AM] Hexanite#6957

[02-Dec-18 01:03 AM] BitExcellence#0976
guys, on coin fair value, i see komodo have an average of 65k transactions per day, are these all users transactions or there is some sort of an app generating all these txs?

[02-Dec-18 01:04 AM] PTYX#6840
Most likely the notarizations contribute to those transactions

[02-Dec-18 01:06 AM] BitExcellence#0976
what would be the percentrage of notarization from these 65K?

[02-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Alright#0419
notarizations make up for majority of them, but you have to realize that KMD is main trading pair for about 20 coins

[02-Dec-18 01:12 AM] Alright#0419

[02-Dec-18 10:52 AM] Seko#7408
@benohanlon  The users are insecure.  They don't know if their Exchange supports the Hardfork.  There is no information from some Exchanges.  Bitpanda refers to the AGB, in which it is written that Hardforks are not supported.  Ledger has no information either.

We need a text to take the fear away from the users.  A concrete publication.

does Sapling make it possible to do shielded tx in lite mode? Or native is still required? This part isn't clear to me

[02-Dec-18 01:42 PM] PTYX#6840
I read that's in theory possible with the sapling update

[02-Dec-18 01:42 PM] PTYX#6840

Native still required for now, SPV needs to be tinkered to work with it

[02-Dec-18 01:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I know it's much less computation intensive and I read Sapling helps with mobile wallets but not clear if it's a first step in that direction or makes it already possible

[02-Dec-18 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810

there are some issues with how Zcash is doing light wallets, in my opinion. Light wallets won't be able to use the memo field, by default, and in the implementation above. But it's a start

One of the laws allow banks to give bank accounts to cryptocoin businesses, which is pretty important. Right now, it's a legal mess, at the federal/country level. So they are defining things at the state level, so banks can legally deal with cryptocoin companies, is the TLDR

Noob question, are CC  implemented on asset chains 'by default'?

[03-Dec-18 02:31 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
And can they work across asset chains?

[03-Dec-18 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to start the chain with `-ac_cc=x`

[03-Dec-18 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
where x is above 2

[03-Dec-18 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
and `-addressindex=1 -spentindex=1`
