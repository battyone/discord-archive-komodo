[17-Jun-19 03:21 PM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
Binance is busy with their own things. They lost so much $$ on the value of BNB.  The new Binance US site is garbage with KYC and limited coins.

[17-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Caglio#3337
@BTC-BTC-BTC :/ still I want to be able to move my poor kmd ( :

[17-Jun-19 04:14 PM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
Definitely agree to move all the coins out if you are in the US and want to keep your alt coins. US customers have less than 90 days to trade there. They said still able to withdraw after 90 days. But I wouldn't recommend to wait. Get them out asap.

[17-Jun-19 04:25 PM] Allen#8663
Yeah, it will be similar to Huobi US which only offers BTC, BCH, XRP, ETH, ETC, ZEC, LTC.

I believe they did not say what kind of blockchain they are using I it will most likely not be accessible to the public as you have to pay for a node?

given that you have a KYC approved account, then it seems it is a matter of doing a transaction and they talk of smartcontracts, so it should be similar to ERC20 support

[19-Jun-19 05:22 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Russia, France and Usa are already talking of banning it, so not sure if it will actually become real

[19-Jun-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
USSA has to pretend to want to ban it...

[19-Jun-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that way when it is released they wont be suspected of buying the data from it.

[19-Jun-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be they ban all other cryptos and force people to use corporate coins
