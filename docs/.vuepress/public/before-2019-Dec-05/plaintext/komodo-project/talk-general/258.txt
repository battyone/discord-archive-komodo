If you like playing games and crypto, you‚Äôre gonna love this.

We‚Äôre not talking about one game... we‚Äôre talking DOZENS OF RELEASES over the next few years, with many projects already taking shape.

One of the devs over there is a big XMR guy and is pretty about Counterparty for BTC. I tried selling him on Komodo for their KR in-game currency

[09-Apr-19 05:21 PM] gcharang#6833
totally different. we extend bitcoin's utxo system to create custom consensus modules, the link I posted above.
they had to create a new language to describe contracts that run on chain and interact with the Eth VM, while this created a scarcity for resources like gas and block space, it wasn't required
we simply leverage the native computational capabilities of the full nodes to write modules(that replace contracts) that behave as we need them to

[09-Apr-19 05:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
smartcontracts are a subset of what Komodo Crypto Conditiions do. They're customizations that work in the coin daemon. There's no virtual machine. Completely different from all others.

Visa can sustain their business because they make money by charging processing fee. 

Visa can double-spend customer‚Äôs money whenever they want, 
but they never do because that‚Äôd be against their own interest. 

Same for Bitcoin. Economics and game theory are what secure Bitcoin.

I am asking these questions with good faith so we can recognise if there is something we need to address ...
