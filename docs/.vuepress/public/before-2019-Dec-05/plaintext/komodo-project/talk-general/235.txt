Komodo is not on ICE's new data feed. (Scroll to bottom), while many others with similar market caps are there.

@CoinMarketCap has added a ranking called FCAS that calculates a 'fundamentals' score. From what I've seen it's a complete joke, a monkey throwing darts would do the same job
Twitter

[19-Mar-19 01:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe paid ad for flipsidecrypto

[19-Mar-19 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Cute... i linked it here and within seconds you tweeted a response. Just curious did you even make it to the FCAS link explaining what they look for before you tweeted or was that just auto fire?

[19-Mar-19 02:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I had already tweeted it, then checked Discord and read your post

[19-Mar-19 02:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol like we did it at the same time!!!

[19-Mar-19 02:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
I dont think the concept is a joke, nor some of the scores for older coins

[19-Mar-19 02:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
But they obviously didnt bother to really research KMD

[19-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Llama#1330
How is FCAS so low if we have high activity and constant development?

[19-Mar-19 02:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
They didnt look hard enough

[19-Mar-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
BTG has a rating of 'C'

[19-Mar-19 02:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
Im going to bet dev interactions brings KMD low in their score... alot of stuff comes from others they likely dont deem as "dev"

[19-Mar-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
confused, how does dev interactions bring KMD down?

[19-Mar-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
as in their scoring method not your actual interactions

[19-Mar-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so their data is just totally wrong

[19-Mar-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes

[19-Mar-19 02:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
and...

[19-Mar-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
you have to admit James... you personally let the community do most of KMDs talking and its a good thing

[19-Mar-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
they scoring does not reflect that obviously

[19-Mar-19 02:15 PM] daemonfox#6136

[19-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810

thats so true lol

[19-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
or, if it isnt via tweet it doesnt count?

[19-Mar-19 02:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
right

[19-Mar-19 02:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
if it cant be aggregated... no count

i would say Tron is the worst, but its not, because EOS and XRP exist.
