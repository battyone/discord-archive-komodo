and more than half already processed? Then it is doubly cool!

[07-Jun-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
please read and follow instructions

[07-Jun-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
half of the first part 1) of 3

[07-Jun-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
third part is the most work to automate and also needs manual reconciliation and detection if disputed

[07-Jun-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
ie. not until next week

[07-Jun-19 01:04 PM] lion#5837
do you mean accounts over 7777?

[07-Jun-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
all accounts are being sent special tx 1)

[07-Jun-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
this allows everyone to do the special tx 2) in parallel with me solving 3)

[07-Jun-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
saves 2 days+ for the entire refund process

[07-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Dyeles#8347
@jl777c could you please announce when all the txd have been sent, that way I will know if definitelly I'm not getting it and then proceed with whatever method you need, excuse my english, trying to be calm and sound reasonable

[07-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i said i would do this, do not worry

[07-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Dyeles#8347
thank you

[07-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Buddz1993#5380
One more question @jl777c ,  so whenever I receive the special txid in the compromised wallet , I will send the the new wallet that it‚Äôs called claim address , the point is I just changed my claim address like one hour ago , so which one should I sent to until I know my new claim address has been updated ?

[07-Jun-19 01:07 PM] lion#5837
we are ready to wait - you have already done a fantastic and operational work! Hardly anyone is capable of such a thing without a rollback of the block!

Can I send someone a DM in regards of a partnership proposal?

[07-Jun-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
you can keep asking, bug until all are sent, not all are sent

[07-Jun-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
@Milo, no

[07-Jun-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we are busy now

[07-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Milo#8842
@jl777c yes i've noticed, with the hack

[07-Jun-19 01:09 PM] lion#5837
just now only 60% worked out

[07-Jun-19 01:10 PM] bitcoinstrader#6920
Should I send the entire small amount from compromised address to claim address???

[07-Jun-19 01:10 PM] aka222#2811
Hello friends what's the best way / store kmd. Besides paper wallets

[07-Jun-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810

Received the amount 2 times, meant to be?

[07-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Dyeles#8347
@jl777c  one last question, once I get it, should I send it to the original paperwallet from my claim or the one I gave to Shossain yesterday from Verus

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
send it to the most recent address you put in the claim

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] NMD3#0024

Thanks a lot @jl777c & team!

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Dyeles#8347
@jl777c I just don't know if Shossain updated the address or not

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Dyeles#8347
I asked him but haven't respond

[07-Jun-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 01:16 PM] joe201#9786
@jl777c  When I opened the compromised agama wallet to locate the transaction ID, I noticed a zero balance with no transaction history. I also noticed that my address is not the same as it should be. Do I need to use my seed to restore to the old address so that I can locate the transaction ID? The directions for submitting claim form instructed not to enter the seed into the compromised wallet

[07-Jun-19 01:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
you got the wrong seed probably

[07-Jun-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
please ask others for basic support issues, i wont be able to help with such things

[07-Jun-19 01:18 PM] istante#3749
I m out at home now... could i check this eventual special it tonight ?

[07-Jun-19 01:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no rush

[07-Jun-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is totally up to you when you do special tx 2), just dont expect there will be refund tx 3) before you do 2)

[07-Jun-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
also even if you do 2), until .implement 3), nothing will happen

[07-Jun-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i will post as soon as i start processing the refunds

[07-Jun-19 01:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@joe201 you will need the old seed and then do a tx from it to claim, if you used your old seed and it is a different address you put in the wrong seed

[07-Jun-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the addresses that have exactly one claim submitted and are < 7777 will be processed first.

[07-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380

@hyperDEX  the weird thing is when I restored my seed the public address was suddenly different... does this mean I've been compromised?

[07-Jun-19 01:21 PM] istante#3749
Jl777 and all the team : many thanks for yr support... really...

[07-Jun-19 01:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@joe201 you are just enterintg the seed wrong, there might be extra spaces 
copy/paste carefully

[07-Jun-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
autocapitalization is also a possible issue

They have handled this very well. If anything this event has made me want to contribute to kmd rather than just being a hodler.

[07-Jun-19 01:24 PM] joe201#9786
I'll try the seed again. Once I get into my wallet, do I just need to locate the transaction ID from the sweep and enter it on the claim form?

[07-Jun-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it is easier now

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
just send 0.0001 from the compromised address to your secure claim addres

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Pwnz#4150
Wow got the special TX and sent it to my final addy. U guys are super fast. Kudos Komodo team!

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
everything else i made fully automatic

[07-Jun-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so all that is needed is your compromised address and the destination address

[07-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
both the special tx 2) and a proper claim are needed for me to be able to process the refund. sort of like a 2FA

[07-Jun-19 01:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@joe201 before that, create a new wallet seed using verus agama and fill the form mentioning the new address

[07-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you made many claims for the same address (you know who you are), you will be at the back of the list as it wont be able to be automatically processed

[07-Jun-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also, if there is a dispute

[07-Jun-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
or if it is bigger than 7777, it will go in the second batch

[07-Jun-19 01:27 PM] tomsmith26#8707
i have just received a little kmd to my old KMD address  so I must send it to my new address KMD for claiming ?

[07-Jun-19 01:27 PM] lion#5837
@jl777c  I just got 0.00023002 from R9JCEd6xnCxNUSpLrHEWvzPSh7CNXm7z75 - is this what you need ??? Now I have to send 0.0001KMD to the new address specified in the application?

[07-Jun-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly. then assuming the claim was done properly, 3002 KMD will be sent to your claim address

[07-Jun-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
see, the blockchain will record every single refund claim, what state it is in, and how it was resolved

[07-Jun-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
all visible with simple block explorer

[07-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380

Does this matter if I've done it yesterday early hours?

[07-Jun-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter and better to not make duplicates

[07-Jun-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
duplicates go to the end of the queue
