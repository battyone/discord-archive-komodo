Much slower than centralized exchanges

[25-Jul-18 10:45 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
What I really wanted to find out tonight is whether there really is a decentralised exchange that exists yet which simply cannot be sabotaged either by Uncle Sam or indeed the developers themselves

[25-Jul-18 10:45 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
It doesn't have to be one that checks _every_ box like being able to trade dust etc

[25-Jul-18 10:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Nothing is invulnerable . But in terms of decentralization BarterDEX is king.    It allows you to form your own P2P network,  none of the others are doing that

[25-Jul-18 10:47 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I just mean to Bitcoin's standard

[25-Jul-18 10:47 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Obviously that's vulnerable to consensus lols

[25-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
But as long as those who form that don't all signal for a really retarded change

[25-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
The reason I'm delving into this is because last year I had a theory that the crypto world may end up split into two

[25-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
And sure enough some months later Japan suddenly takes a dim view to the coins you'd expect heh

[25-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
So it makes sense that sooner rather than later any exchanges trading "krypto" will have to comply in one way or another

[25-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Or else of course simply be as untouchable as Bitcoin is decentralisation-wise so that all they can do is shake their fists at it

[25-Jul-18 10:50 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
It seems obvious to me that it's only a matter of time before hegemonists will try to properly block those

[25-Jul-18 10:50 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Once it becomes a popular means for the little guy to not pay his fair share just like the rich mostly do these days heh

[25-Jul-18 10:51 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
But of course whether anyone will tip their tin foil hats to that here is neither here nor there heh

[25-Jul-18 10:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bitcoin is one network.  In BarterDEX you can have many networks. I would say it's more decentralized.

[25-Jul-18 10:53 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
So would BarterDEX be somewhere that folks could use to flog 100 XMR anonymously and walk off with the BTC?

[25-Jul-18 10:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Except cryptonight and it's variants are not currently compatible

[25-Jul-18 10:54 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
And if our backward Game of Drones oligarch-driven world decides that XMR is a terrorist coin is there anything they could actually do about it?

[25-Jul-18 10:54 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Ah okay heh well I mean supposing for now it _is_ (any idea what the ETA is?)

[25-Jul-18 10:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Whenever monerolabs figures out how to emulate bitcoin style multisig in their ring signature scheme

[25-Jul-18 10:57 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
If we suppose for the sake of argument that were to happen this year

[25-Jul-18 10:57 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
I'm only using XMR as an example really because I think that's going to become public enemy #1

[25-Jul-18 10:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If it became compatible someone would probably add it

[25-Jul-18 10:59 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Ignoring that for now though

[25-Jul-18 10:59 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Say it appears and it becomes heavily used on BarterDEX

[25-Jul-18 10:59 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
And then boom another 9/11 and oh look these funny-looking people were paid in XMR and we know because they were all wearing Monero cable-knits and they all survived the explosion somehow

[25-Jul-18 10:59 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Can the feds stop XMR from being traded on BarterDEX?

[25-Jul-18 10:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[25-Jul-18 11:00 PM] Shingo Murata#3184
Excellent

hi there, i just read about your new  crosschain - smartcontract feature that you are planning to develope ...isnt it very similar to what wanchain is doing ?

[26-Jul-18 06:39 AM] OrgiOrg#1001
hi @PTYX:  got a email from somebody who claim to be you and offer ChainZilla AirDrop. Is it legit?

[26-Jul-18 06:47 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I also got it

[26-Jul-18 07:43 AM] jorian#4555
@panzerwagen don't know much about wanchain, but as far as i can see, inter-chain transactions costs some WAN, so you always need WAN. afaik, you don't pay KMD to do an interchain transaction between 2 komodo chains. WAN also seems focussed on ethereum, and komodo isn't.

[26-Jul-18 09:11 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Guys.. i just got blown away.
I got adviced not to mine to an adress i created with my nano ledger. So im mining straight to that adress.
Now it is stated that i am destroying my ledger doing so because of all the tiny transactions im doing to it. Too many write cycles..

What a bullshit.. the ledger only serves to consult balance..

Wow.. just wow.. too many idiots around trying to convince you of utterly crap random bullshit

[26-Jul-18 10:03 AM] ca333#0118
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies you shouldnt be able to destroy your ledger by doing so. the only reason i could think of that ledgerHQ doesnt like this (or why this random BS is being spread) is because of the additional load for their infrastructure. BOLOS - their blockchain operating system which acts like a SPV network that does broadcast all the BC data could be overloaded if all users mine into their ledger device. This could potentially have a similar effect like a DDOS attack. 

But again - dont worry ref. your ledger - it does nothing else than holding your keys and signing the transactions. The rest happens on the client-software. So worst case if client-software wont be able to handle the Tx load just reset device - use new seed - import old seed to Agama - transfer funds to new ledger key(s).

[26-Jul-18 10:15 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats how it is .. but it states on ledger support that micropayements to ledger will wreck up the device 😂

[26-Jul-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like SPV, which might actually have a limit of utxo (around 1000)

[26-Jul-18 10:21 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Okay.. but to mine at such extend you create a 1000 payements to your wallet.. :)

1/ Will decentralized networks replace centralized firms as the dominant mode of human organization in the years to come? The answer will have a lot to do with network effects, so below is a big list of the best thinking about network effects and crypto. 👇

Hi, will FIBRE coin ever get relaunch or is it gone for good?

[26-Jul-18 05:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@DimgDongSoLong you can mine KMD

[26-Jul-18 05:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@jimmy me and @metaphilibert discussed snapshotting it and relaunching as an assetchain, (more for the sake of documenting a coin -> assetchain procedure for other coins) but neither of us have gotten around to it yet

[26-Jul-18 05:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There doesn’t seem to be much demand for fibre anymore, so idk what expectations there would be for relaunching it

Hello.
I have one question.....

Is it possible to confirm in blockchain the contract 10 sec after the contract is executed 10 seconds before the block is created? Or do I have to wait 1 minute 10 seconds?

[27-Jul-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you can look in the mempool for near instant results, but until its confirmed it is unconfirmed

[27-Jul-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and even after confirmed, until notarized, subject to longest chain rule

[27-Jul-18 08:49 AM] JAPK#3085
Does it mean that at least 10 confirmed blocks are safe?

[27-Jul-18 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
once it gets notarized, it is much more secure. notarization lag varies, but you can check it on: https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json

[27-Jul-18 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
most are indeed less than "lag" of 10

[27-Jul-18 08:53 AM] JAPK#3085
It will be 10 minutes before the smart contract will be valid.
Is it right?

[27-Jul-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the contract is valid

[27-Jul-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you send funds to it and the contract does what the contract does

guys, a while ago I lost my komodo coins into this wallet add "https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RHfYyXZvuHqsYzhhwqXzh1e19uWxNtytYD"

[28-Jul-18 12:30 AM] Shinsoo#0021
sorry let me rephrase, I moved my kmd coins from guarda wallet to agama. But because I am stupid I couldn't log back into the same address "https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RWKHygoiPqtyVzyFL4P1h7ZiUJTEbJE4G2" after few days and my kmd coins got stuck there. I checked the address today, it looks like my coins are no longer there. Can someone please confirm if my 956 coins have moved from that address?

Guys please vote for KMD's sister coin HUSH to be listed on the https://sonox.io exchange. It requires no info, just a simple click and top 3 placement will give a "capital influx" to HUSH, helping KMD recognition too. There is only a couple hundred votes between us and first place... keep up the momentum, vote daily on as many different wifi/mobile data connections as you can an we could see that number 1 spot!! Much love xx
