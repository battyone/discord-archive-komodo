I had a look at the atomicwallet.io whitepaper, that was shilled by Charlie Shrem (he's in the team of course)

[23-Jun-18 08:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
from my understanding one of the main differences with bdex is that it hasn't automatic ordermatching

[23-Jun-18 08:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's like an atomic OTC trading tool, with a list of offers and both parties must actively agree to swap

👌 

[23-Jun-18 08:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
relatively easier to build, yet an useful tool. Bdex of course has a diffent scope

[23-Jun-18 08:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I know that direct OTC trading is something that will arrive in bdex too in future

[23-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
OTC already happens, just go to unused netid

[23-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
like 1747383

[23-Jun-18 08:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yeah already possible, just there isn't a simple gui for that

[23-Jun-18 08:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so bdex will do the same atomicwallet.io does, plus decentralized ordermatching and more

[23-Jun-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
it's already doing

HyperDEX is really cool, i use it a lot. Very easy to use.

[23-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Enkh D#1827
why are ca333 and ptyx working on different projects? is komodo team falling apart or there is nothing more to be done?

[23-Jun-18 08:48 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
their projects are related to Komodo and very useful to expand to ecosystem

[23-Jun-18 08:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Deleted User you seem to know more, if I agree with someone to do an OTC trade with bdex using a random netid, is there a precise formula to divide our utxo that ensures 99% successful and precise swap of the agreed upon amounts?

[23-Jun-18 09:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
If it's possible this makes a very nice use case that with a simple how-to guide would help to spread bdex awareness

why say 99% vs 100%? what accounts for the remaining percent?

[23-Jun-18 10:21 PM] Tort#9226
are we defining failure as a few sats off? or that the whole tx fails for some reason?

[24-Jun-18 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if it's intentionally ignoring BarterDEX, I guess it's fine. They are not the sole personalities who can help with liquidity. 
as HyperDEX goes more easier to use and user friendly, liquidity will flow automatically.

I prefer to  stick with Komodo (when you have the word in your mind the word WHY,-we need to be obsessed with this word WHY-i believe I'm on right path for me I don't say for everybody  will work-if you have money you can buy popularity but in the moment you stop spending is go away,we know most of the projects spend huge amounts of money for sale to go up(they are not idealistic)
The way Komodo will spread will be somebody else will mention,for so many years we where obsessed with early adoption,I prefer to be part of a project which doesn't make a tone of money for impact in future not for  a quick return ,how long will take -we don't know  but conscientious is more important than intensity

[24-Jun-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> depends what you mean with "dependency" 😆
eg i never use BTC in BarterDEX, because it simply takes too long, txfees are too high and i don't see the necessity of using it, we have many very good alternatives, like KMD

Anyway... the problem is whales are USD dependents, it will be always tied to USD, BTC or not BTC.

@Ludom remind me again how KMD losing 8.25% of buying value in the last 24hrs, just because people are dumping BTC, isn't bad for someone using KMD as an actual currency....

Is there a roadmap for the Agama wallet specifically?

[24-Jun-18 01:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Dr.Terminus In truely decentralised exchange, whoever and however many there'll ever be, if there is ANY coin to ANY Coin trade is possible, that just ends that fear or dominance of single coin pairs.

And BarterDEX is that truely decentralised exchange, so far that I know of. Not sure if there's any other On-Chain atomic swap tech out there which covers both major coin protocols (BTC & ETH) in market.

TL;DR: BarterDEX does ANY to ANY coin pair trades. There is NO single coin specific set in it. It's another matter that right now there are more KMD users who understand and knows about it, so KMD pairs are more in BarterDEX. As easy UI projects like HyperDEX and dICOApps and others from ChainZilla will be out there'll be more trading pairs.

Also, as of now BTC is dominant in total market, so in my views it is best if we have more trade pairs available.
Having fiat gateway's linked to BarterDEX would be another advantage, not a disadvantage.
Everyone wants to exit the banks cartel who understand how they slave people, and having fiat gateways is the best, however they link to cryptocurrency world.
and if got linked to DEX, it's the other level up best!

1 very important thing missing in the article. The cost of that per hour.  CAn we know the cost and "compare" to visa some way ?

[24-Jun-18 06:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
The cost comparison should be mentioned in all channels and articles....

[24-Jun-18 06:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
let's take in only tech cost / hardware or sth ?

[24-Jun-18 06:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
total cost will be for sure smaller as Visa is corporation , but maybe even counting only hardware KMD does better ?

[24-Jun-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
cost for hardware is kinda scale relative

[24-Jun-18 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
cost was less than $1000

[24-Jun-18 06:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
total or 1h ?

[24-Jun-18 06:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe there is kind of hardware + electricity or sth ?

[24-Jun-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
for the 1h, maybe it was $100 not sure

[24-Jun-18 06:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or hours coding ? 😃

[24-Jun-18 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using AWS for the demo

[24-Jun-18 06:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so for 36k per year we have ~Visa capacity network

[24-Jun-18 06:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
bigger cost would be developer debugging  software / helpdesk?

[24-Jun-18 06:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
still extreme low comparing to corp

[24-Jun-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure the total cost for running it 24/7/365

[24-Jun-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once the bugs are fixed, there shouldnt be much ongoing debugging costs, just the usual helping the user who  lost their passphrase

Why development languages can be used for the komodo platform ?

[25-Jun-18 09:35 AM] lc1981#8868
which

[25-Jun-18 09:36 AM] lc1981#8868
he lo ?

[25-Jun-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
any language that can create linkable libraries. The assumption is you are a blockchain dev and can make mods to source code

[25-Jun-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on making things possible without any coding and currently you can launch an independent blockchain with customized chain parameters, in 5 minutes

[25-Jun-18 09:42 AM] lc1981#8868
But if anyone can create his blockchain, maybe there will be much garbage to come? For example NEBLIO requires 10 NEBL in order to create your own token... Komodo platform is free for this or am I wrong ?
