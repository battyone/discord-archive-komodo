Great article on the history of Atomic Swaps

[05-Jul-19 04:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Real nice & smooth read

[05-Jul-19 06:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
A@costa2439  Atomic, in this sense , means , the swap happens or it doesn’t .   When people reference atomic token swaps,  they are just saying a swap of one token for another on a single blockchain.  What Komodo does is crosschain swaps .  More than 1 chain

[05-Jul-19 06:20 AM] SVET5#3137
@rainbro7  Magnum is really easy to use. Just connect your ledger and manage your fund. You could even claim rewards in magnum. Really looking forward for more smartchains being supported just like Chainzilla.

@PTYX how is it going to get kmd asset on trezor?

[05-Jul-19 08:34 AM] farl#9964
@LocoMB yes, Trezor needs browser

[05-Jul-19 09:04 AM] costa2439#3771
@polycryptoblog ok, thanks. It's like I thought

[05-Jul-19 10:04 AM] Audo#5667
@wil yes you are right. We want to position KMD as the default KMD pair too and make it the most liquid base pair on AtomicDEX. We will make a new site for AtomicDEX for the actual product launch.

[05-Jul-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
we are looking into making KMD work as BNB token does for the dexfees. so the more KMD you have, the lower the dexfees
someone posted that idea and it seems a very good way

we have to make sure it is ok to do

[05-Jul-19 10:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c will that tie into the 0conf stuff and liquidity multiplier?

[05-Jul-19 10:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe the more KMD you have the bigger the "leverage" to multiply

[05-Jul-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure that is practical. will be hard enough to have a different set of dexfees based on KMD balance

[05-Jul-19 10:11 AM] Audo#5667
alternatively the dexfee could be lower for all KMD pairs, promoting the use of KMD

@Audo That sounds great! Thanks for your answer.

As far as I remember in MM2.0 the maker does not pay anything, only the taker pays the commission. There is a good example of how to solve the problem of liquidity. In the Bitmex, every trader using passive limit orders receives a 0.0250% rebate. The fee is paid only by those who use market orders 0.0750% . Thus, every trader using limit orders is interested in becoming a market maker / liquidity provider.

nSPV fullnode is in testing. it has all the required support for nSPV clients. also the low level rpc -> p2p message -> json result is working from the client side, so now all that is left is to use this to make a reference cli wallet. the nSPV fullnode will affect all normal nodes, so we do have to have an extended testing for this, but the simplicity of the design has allowed for rapid progress. we already can support 870 nSPV clients with a single full node and that seems to be some internally imposed limit. i will look into that later, for now the next step is to get the cli reference wallet done so GUI devs can know what needs to be done.

the nSPV fullnodes will create a decentralized network of nodes to support all the nSPV clients, essentially like a decentralized electrum servers, just built into each fullnode, and also will have nearly full node security for the nSPV clients

[05-Jul-19 11:28 AM] Audo#5667
negative maker fee sounds like an interesting concept

[05-Jul-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant do that, as there is no centralized system

[05-Jul-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a rebate during revshares, but it is complex enough as it is

[05-Jul-19 11:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
why not just 0 fees for maker, 0.5 for taker?

[05-Jul-19 11:45 AM] Audo#5667
we already have 0 fees for all makers regardless of the trading pair

[05-Jul-19 11:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah ok

[05-Jul-19 12:09 PM] costa2439#3771
How would that affect dex? really those fees are owned by dex holders

[05-Jul-19 12:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
more users using the dex  = more dex fees

[05-Jul-19 12:18 PM] hyperDEX#6586
even if the dex fees is slightly discounted

[05-Jul-19 12:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
most importantly for dex to be hack-proof. No point in having decentrlized trading while the app will be centralized around some libs which can be vulnerable for malicious code injection. Why people look for dex is hack proof or scam proof, unlike centrlized exchanges, but since code may have central weakness it may be perceived as not as safe as it appears to be in theory

[05-Jul-19 12:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so to me what is most attractive is not low fees , just security in every aspect

[05-Jul-19 12:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also for the app name / brand is important - it's hard to build brand, but easy to destroy

[05-Jul-19 12:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so my point is everything else I see as secondary - how you calculate fees or even if ui is easy... personally I would pay higher fees and even use less easy UI as long as I believe security

[05-Jul-19 12:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but of course for many people ui seem more important, but still make no sense to trade security for easy ui building by using3rd party libs to make ui easier and faster; when the news goes around that the app was hacked, nice ui will not be so nice any more

[05-Jul-19 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
@hastrup we will likely have chainzilla on trezor in the next month and a half.

[05-Jul-19 02:32 PM] Sharifa#7849
Hello.

First time i hear about $DEX.
Who's idea is this anyway? 
Why not simply using $KMD?

It would benefit all of us.

[05-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Sharifa#7849
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 it has to be a "user-friendly and one-click solution" DEX

[05-Jul-19 02:37 PM] Audo#5667
Cross-chain atomic swap DEX is superior to proxy token models that have to rely on a blockchain. That blockchain comes like a bottleneck through which all trading has to happen, plus it introduces a security risk as the users have to change their real coins to IOU's.

[05-Jul-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
any coin that pays out revshares will have a very hard time to maintain listings

[05-Jul-19 03:15 PM] Sharifa#7849
@jl777c  KMD token should be used inside the DEX to pay for network transactions as well as $DEX (just learned of its existence an hour ago ☹) and ultimately become a rival to BNB

[05-Jul-19 03:16 PM] 차미숙#8912
Any kmd related asset shouldn't get listed

[05-Jul-19 03:17 PM] 차미숙#8912
Those assets do not need exchanges anyway

[05-Jul-19 03:18 PM] Sharifa#7849
@jl777c the team should also open new markets for KMD/$DEX as a token launch platform (Komodo Launchpad) and as an accelerator for crypto startups (instead of Binance Labs -> Komodo Labs).

[05-Jul-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
KMD isn't a token and Komodo Labs is a separate project entirely

[05-Jul-19 03:20 PM] Sharifa#7849
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yeah whatever

[05-Jul-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not "whatever", words matter

[05-Jul-19 03:20 PM] 차미숙#8912
Anyone can open token launch platform on top of kmd

[05-Jul-19 03:21 PM] Sharifa#7849
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 dude, i'm just a KMD holder not a technical person

[05-Jul-19 03:21 PM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c any coin that pays out revshares will have a very hard time to maintain listing...... Why is that hard?  So is revs dex and jumblr hard to maintain on atomicdex?

[05-Jul-19 03:22 PM] 차미숙#8912
Because it is a security if it acts as a stock

[05-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Audo#5667
He was referring to proxy token DEX solutions where an entity controls and regulates trading & listing

[05-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Audo#5667
we are building an open source code that anyone can use and no single entity can control

[05-Jul-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

AtomicDEX = a product we control, and we can dictate who gets listed and so on.

The product is based on AtomicAPI that is the part no one has direct control over. Anyone can build a DEX with AtomicAPI and choose which coins to list.

[05-Jul-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if KMD paid out revshares, bittrex at least would delist it

[05-Jul-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
along with upbit and who knows which other exchanges

[05-Jul-19 03:24 PM] Sharifa#7849
@jl777c Komodo should also  conduct Initial Exchange Offerings. These IEOs are immensely  popular.

[05-Jul-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[05-Jul-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
others are free to conduct them on top of komodo

[05-Jul-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810

there is no wrapper nodejs for AtomicApi or any other language? just curls?

[05-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Sharifa#7849
@jl777c ok i see but the community wants to use KMD not only to get a discount when trading, but also as a payment coin. So that KMD can start to compete with cryptocurrencies like BNB or is this not allowed?

[05-Jul-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
making KMD into an unregulated security is NOT an option

[05-Jul-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD needs to be squeaky clean. let other things in the ecosystem push the envelope

[05-Jul-19 03:29 PM] PTYX#6840
@owerache probably coming soon

[05-Jul-19 03:30 PM] 차미숙#8912
supernet and dex should stay off exchanges imo

[05-Jul-19 03:30 PM] 차미숙#8912
And crypto too

[05-Jul-19 03:31 PM] owerache#0341
Okay, I'll do that, but for a developer, the doc is not easy... it won't make adoption any easier.

[05-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Sharifa#7849
@jl777c does that mean that the value of KMD will NOT grow?

DEX users will be able to utilize KMD to pay transaction fees, isn't it?
I mean like discount on trading fees, KMD as fee for coin listing, etc...

[05-Jul-19 03:32 PM] owerache#0341
There's bounty for that, right? 😃 if I have time I can do nodejs

[05-Jul-19 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
In general you can use any language module/tool which able to make requests since it's an API

[05-Jul-19 03:35 PM] TonyL#3577
imo description of API is quite clear. Why do you think it's not easy for developers?

[05-Jul-19 03:37 PM] owerache#0341
well because it's easier to use some kind of official SDK or Wrapper in your language

[05-Jul-19 03:37 PM] TonyL#3577
it's an API

[05-Jul-19 03:37 PM] owerache#0341
example facebook sdk or other ..

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
I believe some wrappers / tools will be built on top

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sharifa most coins are not security coins, yet their price can go up

[05-Jul-19 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
there are just like a 10 RPC calls which producing JSON output

[05-Jul-19 03:40 PM] owerache#0341
Yes and? imo if you want adoption you invest in tools, right?

[05-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
you do realize it is still in beta?

[05-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
as in, not all things are done yet

[05-Jul-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
writing wrappers will come afterwards, but if anybody wants to do such things, we can work out some bounties

[05-Jul-19 03:46 PM] owerache#0341
Yes, yes, I realize it's a beta... it was just to help: -(

[05-Jul-19 03:47 PM] owerache#0341
I was just asking if it was in the pipe..

[05-Jul-19 03:49 PM] owerache#0341
I'm dev fullstack I preferred to use an official sdk... that was just my opinion

[05-Jul-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it has a REST (like) interface. not sure how much a wrapper will simplify

[05-Jul-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but i am not familiar with the other languages than C

[05-Jul-19 03:57 PM] owerache#0341
Well example I'm on a project with Node react... I'm not going to have fun making calls... I'm going to build a wrapper that will make calls to me

[05-Jul-19 04:02 PM] owerache#0341

[05-Jul-19 04:46 PM] crumb#2550
you don't need to own any KMD to use AtomicDEX. that's the beauty of it. you can swap LTC for ETH and fee is taken only from the 'taker' part of the transaction

[05-Jul-19 04:46 PM] crumb#2550

Can the taker choose between $DEX & $KMD? 
Btw... since when does $DEX exist? Never heard of it before on Komodo's official channels
