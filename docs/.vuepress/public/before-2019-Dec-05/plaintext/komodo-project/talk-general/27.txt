Nice, and according to the following link, the notary nodes can't even really perform the equivalent of a 51% attack. I can't say I quite understand why yet, but that definitely seems like a good thing.

[12-Jul-18 05:01 PM] anonanon#1085
Oh nice thank you.

[12-Jul-18 05:02 PM] anonanon#1085
At that point, are transaction fees intended to pay for mining and notarizing?

[12-Jul-18 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Notarizing is paid for by the ico fund and people paying for dpow

[12-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Notarization to btc that is

[12-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I just voted on the kucoin telegram for komodo, it's #43 out of 50 with only 333 votes. I think we can do better than that!

[13-Jul-18 01:05 PM] wookie#7663
actually, the more appalling thing is that of the top 50 coins voted on, I only recognize 10 coins! there are so many other !#@$coins that are voted higher than kmd??

[13-Jul-18 01:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I voted

[13-Jul-18 01:30 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Coins are giving away tons of coins away to get voted on kucoin.. not legal?

[13-Jul-18 01:39 PM] wookie#7663
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies in the real world, that would be vote buying and not legal. in the crypto world, anything and everything goes!

U have to  be voted in

I've taken shits that I have more faith in than kucoin

[13-Jul-18 02:41 PM] kh4567#1136
I use kucoin, binance, bittrex, gemini, cryptopia, coinbase, etc.. i think kucoin is quite ok

[13-Jul-18 02:41 PM] kh4567#1136
Cryptopia = worse one

[13-Jul-18 02:42 PM] smellycouch#3071
Nice of you to call them by their formal name

[13-Jul-18 02:42 PM] smellycouch#3071
Kucoin is ok for users

[13-Jul-18 02:43 PM] smellycouch#3071
But they do nothing for the coin

[13-Jul-18 02:44 PM] kh4567#1136
To me important thing in an exchange  is they dont lose ur coin.. and liquidity..

[13-Jul-18 02:44 PM] smellycouch#3071
If coins are exploited they are the last ones to respond

[13-Jul-18 02:44 PM] kh4567#1136
The other way is pay the listing fees

[13-Jul-18 02:45 PM] kh4567#1136
I think its not cheap

[13-Jul-18 02:46 PM] smellycouch#3071
Komodo already built a better exchange

[13-Jul-18 02:47 PM] kh4567#1136
Well need more liquidity

[13-Jul-18 02:49 PM] kh4567#1136
The more users, the more liquid it will be

[13-Jul-18 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
the liquidity issue is definitely critical and we should be approaching it head on

[13-Jul-18 03:01 PM] PTYX#6840
setting up an LP node is a pain in the ass and managing it is tough too. If we remove the learning curve and make it simpler (even with an uglygui) to manage bobs and lps then i think we will be a step closer to finding more liquidity

[13-Jul-18 03:09 PM] smellycouch#3071
@PTYX this seems like a better approach to providing liquidity on barterdex than competing with a bunch of shitcoins to see who can get the most votes for a shady ass CEX

[13-Jul-18 03:15 PM] PTYX#6840
many would like to provide liquidity since they are making profits. if they can't setup an lp though, they will never get there.

Can those be bots?

[13-Jul-18 04:02 PM] wookie#7663
I'm not sure but it doesn't take much to do so. Every KUCoin account can only vote for the same coin once, but you can vote for multiple coins. One would need to create multiple kucoin accounts.

[13-Jul-18 04:03 PM] PTYX#6840
One probably has thousands

[13-Jul-18 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362

We researched and saw that Komodo tech was tested using a concept like MoM to reach 70K tx/s.
