so instead of needing to be lucky to get a big block, all the NN share in the hunted funds

[04-Sep-19 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
yes well, no need to wash dirty laundry in public. these bits and pieces of information doesn't help anyone

[04-Sep-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
75% should be 75%, that part was left out of the dwy website

[04-Sep-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mark81 there have been websites that post the big . blocks, i think for over a year

[04-Sep-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the dwy site is written from his point of view, leaving out the other side. clearly he is quite upset and that colors his narrative

Ok, sorry that i need to push you but i have high respect on you and i would like it to stay that way. @jl777c

[04-Sep-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no problem. the facts are the facts and i always try to make the best decision, taking into account all aspects

[04-Sep-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont always make the right decision, especially during times of stress and this hunting issue exploded just 2 weeks after the hack incident, so i was probably not as calm as i should have been

[04-Sep-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but dwy accusing me of lying, over some lucky big block i got, shows the level of coloration in his narrative

i had just dealt with 8 million stolen KMD, cost me 750,000 KMD and i am being accused of lying over some esoteric technical details about a big block. regular notary mining gets occasional big blocks, at least when there isnt a sniper. i have no interest in hunting, and at times i am too busy to keep my NN node from mining. this year, i gave up my NN spot as i was not doing a good job as a NN anyway

75% should be 75% i aggree full on that, but tbh i cant talk about things i have no clue about. If dwy is seriously threat by some persons (and not that discord blabla run and pray - sorry dwy this no srsly threat for me) then you should go to police and bring them the evidence for that. You dont have to life in fear @dewy....especially not if you have kids

dwy told me he was threatened. i asked him if it was from anybody on the team. he said it wasnt

[04-Sep-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, in spite of my funding dwy with 3BTC, he was very upset that he didnt get the full bonus from the first month of hunting. it was a matter of 800 KMD or so, but it didnt seem right that he would get a full bonus after selling his nodes halfway through the first month of notarizing. so as a matter of principle i decided. there are no rules for what to do with the brand new hunting pool proceeds when a NN sells their nodes halfway through the month. I didnt feel we needed a general election to decide this issue. I decided half the time should get half the reward

[04-Sep-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
75% of blocks should get 75% of rewards

[04-Sep-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
half the time should get half

[04-Sep-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810

This discussion was SUPER extensive on the notary chat so i think it has been already decided

[04-Sep-19 09:08 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please, lets not extend it much more

[04-Sep-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
agreed

[04-Sep-19 09:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`dwy was most upset that he didnt snipe the big blocks himself`
But he did? He was one of the first to get a big block in season 3(roughly 3k I believe, but dont quote me on this, check the blockchain). Along with decker and kolo. All blockchain verifiable data.

[04-Sep-19 09:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He was the first to get one on purpose

[04-Sep-19 09:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Big blocks happened before, but it was luck

[04-Sep-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i of course knew how to get the big blocks and i could have just gotten 90% of them myself, but it was better if it was randomly distributed

[04-Sep-19 09:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Either way, like you said, it has been discussed in great detail. A simple solution that was criticized by a small few.

[04-Sep-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, most have a hard time arguing against 75% of blocks should get 75% of the rewards, so it was just a couple that argued, but extensively

[04-Sep-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
due to that we must have a "governance" problem

[04-Sep-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but my guess is that if we put it up for a vote, the majority of stakeholders would agree that 75% should get 75%

[04-Sep-19 09:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I suppose people are entitled to their opinions, no matter how strong they may be. Myself, I dont mind that, unless it is forced onto others, or adversely affects others. 

With that being said, I find it a bit ironic that somebody publically criticizes a project for allegedly running some sort of organised slander complain on another, in turn, doing exactly what they are complaining about?
I agree with grewal, if there are problems, bring them to light in a constructive manner, present potential solutions and be open to discussion.

For my part i can say this was one of the most extense discussions we ever had in the kmd nn community. Even got very emotional. Me being one of those.

Even though, when i understood that was the best solution for all, i just closed the case and moved on. 

It was a week  or 2 after the hack, we were all stressed, paranoid and exhausted. Anything would have been questioned or taken out of context easily. @jl777c maintained coherence, though even him had obvious signs of exhaustion and stress. I respect that.

The statements Komodo made about K64 essentially just amounted to "do your own research and exercise caution."  Bold claims are always "seemingly false" until independently verifiable evidence is provided.

only the last part you can't really call a fact

[04-Sep-19 10:01 AM] BanHammer#8115
it's Redfox LABS' word against K64's

[04-Sep-19 10:01 AM] BanHammer#8115
and K64's explanation about that happening is a lot more elaborate

[04-Sep-19 10:02 AM] BanHammer#8115
I would like to hear Redfox's full explanation

[04-Sep-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@BanHammer K64 admitted in their livestream that they had not paid redfox.

[04-Sep-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
also, if they paid, where is the txid?

[04-Sep-19 10:04 AM] BanHammer#8115
Obviously they haven't paid

[04-Sep-19 10:04 AM] BanHammer#8115
but the statement that Redfox ended it is disputed by K64

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If we're sticking to facts and evidence, let's stick to facts and evidence.

Did K64 present any evidence to support their claims about RFOX?

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] BanHammer#8115
they state Redfox made some additional demands or something

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] BanHammer#8115
and they ended it

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Right that's what they "stated"

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Again, facts and evidence are needed

[04-Sep-19 10:05 AM] BanHammer#8115
exactly and Redfox states they ended it, because they didn't get funding

[04-Sep-19 10:06 AM] BanHammer#8115
all I'm saying that's not a fact that's their words against K64's

[04-Sep-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a contract, K64 did not honor it, it seems both are saying the same. does it matter who offiicially ended it first?

[04-Sep-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also if they got 78 mil of funding, how could they not have the funding?

[04-Sep-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all very anti-math

[04-Sep-19 10:06 AM] BanHammer#8115
it does

When you build something always will be someone who wants to get the rewards,will be tens of hunderts projects  in future building on top of Komodo and always will be few complaining,look now what vitalik mange to build and the community are angry  and insulting him because price doesn't go up....

Funding or no funding the mistake here was k64 announcing the funding they still didnt have deposited in their accounts.

[04-Sep-19 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have not done externally funded businesses, have no experience on that process, but i can say that a deal is not done until it is finalized. That is why you should not over hype something that is still not finalized.

[04-Sep-19 11:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure now there is more effort, time and stress being invested in dealing with the repercutions of this than the real work they need to be doing to make their project prosper.

True @siu - Chainmakers . That certainly was a mistake. Would have fit the Tron community, but not Komodo. Spreading fud is the same mistake. Let's wait for the facts to unfold for the public. Verifiable facts.

Based on the facts that are present our hands are tied. We had to point out what we know and clarify our relationship as a pure technology provider.

I can say that this public attack campaign did not improve my image about the whole K64 project. If there really was an investment then the team should just wait for the proof and not engage (or praise) such public attacks and drama.

`most have a hard time arguing against 75% of blocks should get 75% of the rewards`
Most also have a hard time figuring out how it's intended to get those rewards that were "counted on" in that figure from binance now that they intent on claiming their own rewards and no longer giving it to miners.
I said it then and I'll say it again.....
75% of blocks should get 75% of the 3KMD block rewards, 75% of blocks cannot guarantee you 75% of unclaimed rewards when those rewards may or **may not go unclaimed** in the future

[04-Sep-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
statistically over tens of thousands of blocks 75% of blocks WILL get 75% of the rewards, unless the big blocks are not randomly mined

[04-Sep-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
when there is a significant deviation, then that is proof that there is non-randomness. this was identified and we corrected for it. now the 75% of blocks is much closer to 75% of the rewards, rather than 50% of the rewards

[04-Sep-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
over 100 million blocks, you have no basis other than an "educated guess" what that 75% will even be
and as binance should prove to anyone actually willing to look at facts, that educated guess is wrong

[04-Sep-19 12:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please no

[04-Sep-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
actually i know that 75% statistically ends up at 75%, if it is randomly distributed

[04-Sep-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
