as i said, it will be sufficient, until it isnt

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant stop offchain sidebets

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant measure it

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yet it creates an onchain incentive

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] Timo#5756
If we bet with a million dollar on the outcome of a football match, I would want to have setup 10 chainlink oracles which all fetch data from 10 different match-result-apis

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
who cares about a 10 million dollar stake, if you will win a 1 billion dollar bet

[19-Apr-19 11:50 AM] Timo#5756
How would you game that system?

[19-Apr-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i have 100 million dollars to spend, you really think I couldnt corrupt 6 of them?

[19-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Timo#5756
*every node having atleast 100.000 at stake

[19-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Timo#5756
Okay, you got a big bunch of money, go on

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
either directly bribe the 10 oracles or participate in them with my army of high reputation/high stake accounts

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Timo#5756
How do you contact them?

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
You can setup 10 chainlinks from different sources apis, use its average price/odds as index

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so that is the defense? the people running the oracles are hard to find?

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
security by obscurity is no security at all

[19-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Timo#5756
No, thats just the first one

[19-Apr-19 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
And if one obv lie - just not count it by some confidence interval

[19-Apr-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it would likely be more practical to just participate in the oracles directly, i have $100 mil worth of stake/reputation to burn and still make $900 mil

[19-Apr-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
$100 mil can create thousands of sybil accounts and infiltrate every oracle

[19-Apr-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so using trusted oracles would seem the only way

[19-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but now you are using trusted oracles

[19-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
which at scale can be found and bribed

[19-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the 51% attack was just theoretical, until it wasnt

[19-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Timo#5756
Don't dodge it, let's go step by step

[19-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
dodge what?

[19-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
are you saying that if I have majority of stake, I cant corrupt every oracle?

[19-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if I have an army of sybil accounts, I cant have them all behave perfectly nicely until I want to corrupt some oracle data?

[19-Apr-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I was on the other side of this debate with zack

[19-Apr-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but he convinced me that data aggregation wont work

[19-Apr-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can make it less likely to be corrupted, but ultimately the offchain sidebet totally blows it out

This includes a great description of parasite contracts, and how they can destroy @AugurProject $rep and @Truthcoin 

Amoveo's $veo oracle does not have any trading fees, so parasite contracts would be beneficial. They would not harm amoveo. https://t.co/osgPkZaeRK

I bet high money here, so I gonna make sure the data comes from big Chainlink node operator. The will be further metrics where I can chose oracles from. I'm not sure how familiar you are with Chainlink...
You CAN have a metric saying, I want to use one node operator that has worked 50.000 jobs and had no penalty/bad data for x amount ot time. I can also go an chose a node operator that is certified by a third party, let's say a known data provider from the non-crypto space. This is gonna be a thing.

Do you think you can pay him enough that he throws away all his reputaiton, losing his revenue he worked for months/years? Let's say you find out which 10 nodes are serving the smart contract and contact them. You would have to convince 50% of them to try and attack the network, sending false data. So either change the data after receiving it from the API, so inside the oracle node, and then  send it (which isn't possible with TEE), or you would have to convince 50% of the actual data provider, the size of bloomberg, which is true as I, who opens the bet with you choose 10 big fucking providers to deliver that data. And the 50% corrupt providers still have the risk in loosing all their stake

ok, ignore the game theory if you want. I am just relaying the points made by experts who are deep into this for years

[19-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Timo#5756
"if I have an army of sybil accounts, I cant have them all behave perfectly nicely until I want to corrupt some oracle data?"
An army of sybil accounts don't mean anything, they would be outweighted by a lot. You have for example someone with 100.000$ of Chainlink token. That is just one of ten. So you pay atleast 1 million in acuiring the token for only having more stake. Then you have the reputaiton. If you just newly created these accounts, the reputation is pretty much zero. So no matter if you got 500.000$ of LINK tokens int total of these 5 nodes, they will get outweighted after the reputation get's calculated in

[19-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Timo#5756
I will answer any of your points, no worries

[19-Apr-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
with sufficient funds, the adversary can become the "one node operator that has worked 50.000 jobs and had no penalty/bad  data"

[19-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
adversary is patient

[19-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
works these high stake accounts for years

[19-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Timo#5756
No, I am smart and choose at least 9 others with quite similar statistics, not 9 others that have only 50% of that in total

[19-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
becomes a trusted part of the ecosystem

[19-Apr-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and i have essentially limitless funds so I have 20 such

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
all with $100K+ each and great performance. the best performance

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody knows this

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and then one day, blam! the sleeper awakens

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Timo#5756
Yes, then it could be possible. If you have worked on these for years, and invested in 1.000.000 LINK token and getting hundreds of thousands of jobs done, having a real high reputation... But then these guys make more in the long run with just further serving true data than with the one time you pay them 1 Million dollar

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and corrupts the big money bet

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
these are agents of the evil billionaire

[19-Apr-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
dont need to pay them

[19-Apr-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is indeed deterrence and detection, but not total protection from false data. that is the point. maybe this is just fine and a practical tradeoff

[19-Apr-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
this all started when he said my oracles CC were no good

[19-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Timo#5756
"I was on the other side of this debate with zack
but he convinced me that data aggregation wont work"

Data aggregation alone not, I agree. But with these other components it does. It makes it just to hard to break. So hard that the profit is a lot bigger with staying on the true side, delivering what was asked

[19-Apr-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried to defend them but in the end aggregated data is aggregated data and no way to really protected against a determined, patient and well funded attacker

[19-Apr-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that is true until you bring in the offchain bet

[19-Apr-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
all assumptions that $100K disincentive is adequate go out the window with a $100 mil sidebet

[19-Apr-19 12:06 PM] Timo#5756
Offchain is another thing that no Oracle provider has finalized yet. Also not Chainlink. So debating about that doesn't make much sense to me

[19-Apr-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
well i did

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
trustless oracles doesnt allow bad data onchain

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Timo#5756
So how do you get the data?

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Timo#5756
How is it fetched?

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
no complex incentive/disincentive system

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Timo#5756
So the Nodes acting by the rules without incentive?

[19-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is fetched via the internet. the incentive is to mine blocks

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Timo#5756
Can I spin up a node? Or is it run by Komodo(Foundation?)

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to post valid data to mine a block

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Timo#5756
How is it checked that the data is valid?

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no komodo foundation

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Timo#5756
Who runs the nodes then? Can I spin one up right now?

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_prices="LTC, BCHABC, XMR, IOTA, ZEC, WAVES, LSK, DCR, RVN, DASH, XEM, BTS, ICX, HOT, STEEM, ENJ, STRAT" -pubkey=<yourpubkey> -ac_name=REKT0 -ac_cclib=prices -ac_cc=10777 -ac_reward=3000000000 -ac_supply=120000000 -ac_pubkey=039433dc3749aece1bd568f374a45da3b0bc6856990d7da3cd175399577940a775 -ac_perc=77777 -ac_blocktime=600 -addnode=5.9.102.210 &

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
run that

[19-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it is still in testing phase but so far it is working well

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
http://159.69.45.70:8050/

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] Timo#5756
I can install the software, get connected to mainnet and run actual jobs for other people?

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a different model than chainlink

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a dedicated chain for a specific set of prices

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] Timo#5756
Yeah testnet is fine. Okay, how does my node get selected to serve someone with data?

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you are not understanding

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ALL nodes get all data and validate all blocks

[19-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
all blocks must have valid data to be accepted by the network

[19-Apr-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
like bitcoin validates every tx from genesis

[19-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Timo#5756
What happens if 9 nodes say X and my nodes say Y and I try to finalize the block just like the others?

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a +/- 1% tolerance relative to local prices

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if a block that comes in exceeds that, it is rejected

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
very similar to how timestamps are handled

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact , almost identical

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if a timestamp from the future comes in, it is rejected (if > 60 seconds in KMD)

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] Timo#5756
Okay, so I can falsify the value by 0.99%?
9 nodes say price is 10.0$ and my node says it's 10.0111$. What happens at block finalization?

[19-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if a price >1% away from local price comes in, it is rejected

[19-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
only one miner mines the block, right?

[19-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter what other nodes say, it is not a vote

[19-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a consensus rule

[19-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not aggregating

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Timo#5756
Why doesn't it matter? If I am the fastest to mine that block and put in my wrong data, who or what is stopping me from that?

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody stops you, now you go onto your own fork

[19-Apr-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
when the first honest miner mines a valid block the network will accept that one

[19-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Timo#5756
Yeah but my block is valid. I managed to finalize the block the fastest and can put data into it. How could someone else check that the data is false?
If the other 9 nodes say something different, there is an instant fork?

[19-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Timo#5756
So it's democratic? Like with hashpower, but just with plain data I put into the block?

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt valid if it fails the "are all the prices valid" test

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
try mining with your system clock set wrong
