perfect thanks, we were going to publish an article on the dpow and was researching some of the arguments.

[11-Jan-19 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, you'll find the discussions between jl777 and the devs the most informative

[11-Jan-19 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tried to cover those facts in the dPoW explained blog of mine

[11-Jan-19 11:20 PM] Daiyox#2701
I've read that blog at least 5x, now if only those that claim to know all about dPoW would actually read it as well..Excellent work though @grewalsatinder

James explained it to me and I added it

[11-Jan-19 11:28 PM] Daiyox#2701
I'll check it out now!  It seems dPoW is instantly thought of as some centralized system KMD has among peoples who just glance at it instead of simply an additional consensus layer which was created by Komodo developers..People assume fast, if you know of any graphics depicting dPoW that you think are good, link them if you don't mind..The explanations in words are very good imo, but dPoW represented visually well I haven't seen yet, I suppose because that is one difficult task lol üòÉ

[11-Jan-19 11:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
*People assume fast,
yes, that's the keywords there

[11-Jan-19 11:34 PM] PTYX#6840
wow i'm impressed at how much information is there

[11-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Daiyox#2701
Indeed, it seems the 51% attacks will continue to escalate, so as I see it dPoW is in a win win situation..If dPoW or at least a near equivalent implentation is ignored, then those chains are suicidal imo.  Over time people will notice "Hey those dPoW chains just keep goin", in short at some point I believe less assuming will be done and more "Ok, wtf, we gotta figure this out"

I'd highly suggest anyone sharing the dPoW explained article on interweb so that we can get more Notary Node operators in next election.

[11-Jan-19 11:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I kept in mind that such article will be technical enough to invite more Notary Nodes to the ecosystem

[11-Jan-19 11:40 PM] Daiyox#2701
I bet @grewalsatinder  , no better way to learn than teaching ! One thing I think may help with dPoW..and this is off the top of my head, so error prone but the flow of dPoW summarized I think would be good..For a 3rd party chain for example : Block Mined -> Blockhash sent to nodes -> Consensus reached -> Notaries Broadcast to BTC network ->  TX in BTC mempool -> Notaries broadcast to nodes -> once confirmed,  blocks are locked to prevent reorg  (something like that) ..Im going to take a stab at summarizing but the more thoughts on it the better

[11-Jan-19 11:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, seems like good idea for more technical one, like part 2, the deep technical view of dPoW

[11-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Daiyox#2701
@PTYX A random thought on sales relating to dPoW..I don't know how often or not it's thrown out, but it seems like taking down defenses / assumptions fast would be good..Letting people know they could always implement a notary system of their own, ultimately implement dPoW 100% maintained by their own project would be a great angle, but for now why not give it a try on existing infrastructure..I'd think chances are they'd end up just sticking with the KMD backed notaries..In short, I think removing all the tribalism defenses is good, tell them they can own it all if they want

[11-Jan-19 11:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Even that is difficult,  financial costs and technical debt associated increases 100 fold at least

[11-Jan-19 11:52 PM] Daiyox#2701
Indeed, imo its pointless, but I'd think chains like ETC for example would be more open to the idea initially if they knew over time they could bring it all in house as an option..An option that would never be taken as they become comfortable with the KMD partnership

[12-Jan-19 12:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Isn't hard to do own notaries, main problem is cost, just don't make sense to depoly your own network just for one coin.

[12-Jan-19 01:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think it would be hard for them to select who those notaries would be.   And the time for them to teach everyone what they need to do has a cost associated,  im not an actuary but seems it just isn't practical.

[12-Jan-19 01:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Well, IMO it's practical enough if someone wants to centralise it to a very small number of nodes, like 12... Or something however cost is still a problem, because other coins have no notary revenue model built in.

[12-Jan-19 01:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There's the problem,  their chief argument against DPoW  is centralization of Notary nodes.  If 64 isn't enough , 12 won't be

[12-Jan-19 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The chief argument is that its not centralised to them ;)

Im thinking what would be advantage if there was sth relevant to IPFS for quick memory (RAM) and CPU or even GPU

[12-Jan-19 08:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
that would allow decentralized supercloud computing ?

[12-Jan-19 08:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
IPFS allows decentralized storage, so if sth relevant for other utitlities was found... for sure it would allow savins - like cloud storage is said to be cheaper, then other computer parts access could be cheaper ?

[12-Jan-19 08:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
like computing power and memory

[12-Jan-19 08:59 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
plus people would have possibility to use them for kind of "mining" where mining would be allow access to 1 of their core or 1 GB of RAM or so... to get some payment for that

[12-Jan-19 09:01 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
somehow nicehash is doing so with GPU and CPU right now, just not decentralized way and only for mining tokens right? I mean renting peripherals for any purpose - imagine I want to calculate sth big and need 10^6 GB of RAM or 10^4 CPUS

continuous improvement in all areas, that is what I have been advocating and personally doing that on the coding side. barterDEX was a good example. while others were just marketing the DEX they didnt have, we made it and it allowed non-technical people (who were patient) to actually do atomic swaps. That was quite an improvement from the cli based "solutions" that were hyped, or the onchain   "DEX" (what else can a token swap be??), but we did notice that it wasnt easy enough

so we started the mm2 project to redo the marketmaker from scratch with the new design requirements that were not part of mm1. With this iteration, will it be enough to get mass market? Not sure, but we will find out what is missing and then be able to do mm3 if needed

[12-Jan-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
that is how you get to a working mass market solution. release, get feedback, iterate

barterDEX is so old tech, it was designed to work with coins that dont have CLTV implemented. Back when it was started only a few coins had that. nowadays, virtually all coins do

[12-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
SPV support was added AFTER the initial barterDEX was already working

[12-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
as was ETH support

[12-Jan-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so when you add totally new features after something is done, well, it ends up like adding stuff to something after it is already done and the end result isnt optimally streamlined

[12-Jan-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it also made assumptions about utxo availability locally for broadcasting to ordermatch

[12-Jan-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it does work and even under load as we saw over 100,000 atomic swaps completed, but if you were not technical enough it was hard to understand what went wrong if something wasnt right

[12-Jan-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
this last part is the big question, if we can make it so non-technical users are able to understand how to use it well enough.

[12-Jan-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
many users have nodes behind NAT and couldnt do direct connect, which an atomic swap requires

[12-Jan-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
to solve that mm1 used a third node to act as a conduit

ok so redesign needed to be up to date with current tech and optimization included... the pace in crypto is quite fast
