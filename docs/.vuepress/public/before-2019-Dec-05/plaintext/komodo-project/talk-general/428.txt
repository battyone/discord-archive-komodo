Hmm supernet also holds over 400k hodl

[11-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be interesting to just buy supernet

8.4 million free float

[11-Sep-19 09:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is it traded on any exchanges currently?

[11-Sep-19 09:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Was searching for an exchange and came back to nxtforums, man that place is dead now.

[11-Sep-19 09:24 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes, total tumbleweeds over there 🌵

[11-Sep-19 09:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Kinda sucks, NXT AE was great, unfortunate about what happened

[11-Sep-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So much lost opportunity, but KMD came out of it 🙂

[11-Sep-19 09:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
ironic- because IOTA, LISK, WAVES, NEM also came put of it

[11-Sep-19 09:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
so maybe be thankful for the pigheadedness of certain persons after all 🐗

We have some great news - our team is working on the Antara Gaming SDK: the result is going to be an easy to use "Komodo Blockchain Game SDK" and the first of its kind! @ Komodo Community: feel free to propose icon/logo ideas. You can follow our progress on https://github.com/komodoplatform/antara-gaming-sdk

What kind of games out of interest?

[11-Sep-19 09:32 AM] Slyris#2880
any type

[11-Sep-19 09:33 AM] ca333#0118
yea - there won't be any limitations @hyperDEX (:

[11-Sep-19 09:35 AM] ca333#0118
it will be a dual layer framework/lib - gaming layer and blockchain layer (NSPV and libCC) 
We will provide a reference implementation (howto/tutorial) with a simple game that interacts with the blockchain. We believe that providing game devs high level blockchain functionality access will result in pretty fancy games as they can literally attach a game to blockchain just by utilizing the bc_interface layer in the Komodo Gaming SDK....

[11-Sep-19 09:36 AM] ca333#0118
(not having to mess around with the blockchain aspect since this new KMD SDK takes that part over)

[11-Sep-19 09:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sounds cool  but how will it differentiate from say CHIPS + BET + PANGEA?

[11-Sep-19 10:03 AM] ca333#0118
This SDK will not only provide the blockchain_interface layer - the 2nd essential part is the gaming layer (that is particularily the **UI/gfx layer** - but not limited to this) - which provides devs a basic game skeleton with the game loop, input/output functions, drawing functionality, audio interface, etc. - lets say someone wants to build a fancy 2 player PacMan GUI game that stores gameplay records/highscores, etc. to the blockchain: Komodos new Gamign SDK will even offer a command like `antara_sdk create SFML pacman` (just a pseudo example) which would provide you a folder `pacman` with ALL required SFML libs/bindings, the games main function (gameloop,...) etc. Devs would be able to just start building their game by adding the required assets, game logic, blockchain interaction calls, etc. and voila!

Cool but where is data stored?

[11-Sep-19 10:16 AM] ca333#0118
Depends on the game and also on the type of data - it could be stored into the blockchain just with a simple TX, it could also utilize CC technology for more complex blockchain interaction with specific enforcements, validations, triggers, etc. The technical possibilities are pretty much "unlimited". We would "only" have to respect Moore's Law - means underlying infrastructure, (blockchain) tech stack and resources do limit things to a certain degree.

@ca333 i want to address this out. K64 team has blamed someone from kmd team sabotaging their project with false claims of project funding and  they also are saying that  financial reasons was there to bring competive product  out?

{Reactions}
🔎 

[11-Sep-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
has K64 proven they actually received the funding they said they received? it has already been admitted they never invested any funds into RFOX, contrary to their public posts. all the komodo team has done is point out that there have not been any proofs by K64. how can pointing out the truth be a false claim?

[11-Sep-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mark81 the second part of your question, i dont understand. what does "financial reasons was there to bring competive product  out" mean?

[11-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Mark81#4505
By their words that this invidual is seeking financial benefits from this.

[11-Sep-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
not making payments that are due, is breaking the contract. that is not a good thing to do

[11-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Mark81#4505
But if i understand this under public license.

[11-Sep-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the entire komodo team hoped K64 did receive the funding, that would help everyone. there is no individual on komodo team that would gain financial benefits from K64 failing

[11-Sep-19 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like there are shorting instruments for K64, there is no way to gain from it going down

[11-Sep-19 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
saying komodo team gains by K64 suffering, makes no sense at all

[11-Sep-19 04:03 PM] Mark81#4505
Their thought were that it would be company from this invidual getting gains of this product.

[11-Sep-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what product?

[11-Sep-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not aware of any product and short of komodo team making the same type of games as K64 has in progress, how can there be any competition. there are dozens of types of game categories

[11-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo team has already made a variety of reference implementations of games

[11-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but there isnt any meaningful revenue stream that can be made from tetris on the blockchain

{Reactions}
🙁 

[11-Sep-19 04:11 PM] Mark81#4505
But i believe yhat once they find out this framework they will start publicly complaining of it at least on their discord. Look @jl777c these whole K64 started nicely but is getting out hands. They are doing stuff lot that doesnt make sense to me. They seem to have explanation to every problem. Worse is that to me it seems they will attack against komodo with these claims they have put out. Also  now their CEO has changed at monday but there is no word from him on discord.

[11-Sep-19 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if folks thought about advancements and education above "revenue streams"? 🤔

[11-Sep-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mark81 in most of their presentations they are showing the rogue example that i did, they are well aware of the existing games that we have done.  and not sure what logic justifies them complaining that we are making frameworks to help game development

[11-Sep-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
glad they are not complaining about komodo making tech. if that was a basis for their complaining, they would end up complaining all the time

🙂 

[11-Sep-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, the only thing i saw was komodo team pointing out that K64 never proved they got investment funds from goldman sachs. that is a pretty incredible claim to make, so there are skeptics about it. in their livestream, they admit they are working on a shoestring budget, which makes no sense if they got so much funding,. and why couldnt they honor the contract if they had funds? attacking anybody that raises these questions... this is politics, not tech.

[11-Sep-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
pointing out there is no proof of GS investment, is not an attack, is it?

[11-Sep-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so what "attack" is K64 accusing the komodo team of doing? is pointing out that redfox wasnt paid, is that an attack?

[11-Sep-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
is pointing out there is no blockchain code (that they admit in their livestream), is that an attack?

[11-Sep-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
from what i have seen the komodo team is staying with the facts

[11-Sep-19 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the K64 team is the one throwing around criminal conspiracy theories

@Mark81 - no we are not bringing this out to compete with anyone. There has been quite some demand and we didn't see any deliveries from K64 yet. A gaming  lib like we described it was in the plans for a very long time - actually dated back when we were working on the RogueCC game. Anyway - many of us do like the gaming field and are pretty skilled in this area - and since we have just finished a few projects that release resources we thought lets **build** this.

[11-Sep-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we wait for proof of investment from GS

[11-Sep-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User would you agree that if it turns out there is no actual investment from GS (milestones or not), that K64 has some problems?

[11-Sep-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
K64 promised me they would have a dozen devs to work on the blockchain side. so far, guess the total number of K64 blockchain devs

[11-Sep-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
how can they reach any milestones, if they dont have any funding?

[11-Sep-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
actual funds they can spend?

[11-Sep-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
K64 has already breached their contract with redfox for nonpayment, why didnt they pay?

[11-Sep-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
why dont they hire the blockchain devs. i offered to help train them

[11-Sep-19 04:25 PM] ca333#0118
`saying komodo team gains by K64 suffering, makes no sense at all` - well, K64 suffering is actually negative for KMD too. Attacking an ecosystem project would be like attacking KMD itself. Agreed, that doesn't make any sense. All the negative events around this controversial topic do only affect the ecosystem and Komodo as such in a negative way. K64 succeeding and having the funding would be more positive for KMD (and something the whole team had hoped for) - and every single one of us. Rather then seeing it fail.

how could rfox be at fault, if they never got paid?

[11-Sep-19 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Regardless of K64 having or not having funding. What's the issue with Komodo releasing a gaming Sdk?

[11-Sep-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User how is making a tweet about making a large investment in RFOX a misunderstanding, when no payment is made at all?

[11-Sep-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and why were so many KMD community members who were just in their discord, given K64 team roles? i guess all the community members had misunderstandings too

[11-Sep-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the dump of a million K64 on digitalprice

[11-Sep-19 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a fact, it did happen

[11-Sep-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
how many people received a refund?

[11-Sep-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
significant companies with significant history and team, without horrible PR, they have a hard time to raise $24 million

[11-Sep-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and not at any $1.3 billion valuation

[11-Sep-19 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if all these cognitive dissonance factors about K64, it is ok with you, then it is ok with you. but let each person decide based on what little facts we know

[11-Sep-19 04:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
...

[11-Sep-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i also get asked about how much i invested in K64. apparently they are claiming that i invested as supernet address has some K64

[11-Sep-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
those were gifted to me, i did not pay anything for them

[11-Sep-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
why are they telling people that i invested in K64?

[11-Sep-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
several people asked me about it

[11-Sep-19 04:34 PM] ca333#0118
Well - postponing a contractually assured transaction over 40 (!) times isn't a misunderstanding - correct me if i'm wrong. Anyway - lets move on guys since i believe we should be focusing on pushing the tech beyond limits. Everything else is just irrelevant and time will tell how things work out anyway. But plz don't ~~say~~ think "KMD is attacking project X" when all that KMD (and the whole team) does is actually delivering new tech.

[11-Sep-19 04:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
K64 is claiming they have a valuation similar to the amount of sales of a major game title https://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2019/02/06/red-dead-redemption-2-gallops-to-23-million-copies-in-a-quarter-stock-falls-13/amp/

I am back to coding - rest assured that all that KMD does is creating next level blockchain technology. Sometimes we melt it into a diff. tech layers - like the gaming aspect. I think most of us love gaming

[11-Sep-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo team wishes the best for K64, just that we wait proof of GS investment before we can believe it. and for a company without devs or competent PR, if they dont have funds....

[11-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
when will be the GS announcement of K64 investment?

[11-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and now their CEO is replaced.... this is another one of those "not such a good signs"

[11-Sep-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why do we have to go anywhere to see a tweet or press release from GS?

[11-Sep-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
do they not make it public what companies they are invested in?

[11-Sep-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
some private contract could be under nda for the duration, but VC investment is not under nda as one of the things a VC investment brings to the table is credibility. which you cant get if it is kept a secret

```VC firms are in the business of sharing information with their portfolio companies. Often individual members of the firm have a fiduciary duty to disclose information in their capacity as portfolio company directors. An NDA could exacerbate unnecessary conflicting disclosure requirements.```

[11-Sep-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the NDA in the VC process is more about protecting the company IP from being disclosed and not about VC participation.

[11-Sep-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if there is no GS investment actually made yet, then maybe an nda might make some sense

[11-Sep-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but in that case we are in the bad scenario...

[11-Sep-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810

[11-Sep-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810

[11-Sep-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
notice, this is all simply fact based as far as komodo team goes

[11-Sep-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
we will retweet the GS tweet as soon as it arrives. let us know when it is posted

[11-Sep-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
why? clearly all of K64 hinges on the reality of GS investment, right?

[11-Sep-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so we wait for the GS tweet. until then, the rest is purely speculation

[11-Sep-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i strongly encourage GS to make that tweet
