[21-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Tek#5253
another variant of this might be the "buy or masternode " spam that bots pull on discord

I use Opera, but I also have ZoneAlarm Extreme Security, which now includes Anti-Ransomware protection -- actually restores any files.

[21-Jun-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810

luckely they cant inject a new script / exploit that easily when its alreaady compiled software

[21-Jun-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
my feeling was that the vast majority of projects will be vulnerable to the long term supply chain attack that we got hit with

[21-Jun-19 06:59 PM] Tek#5253
or can they?

[21-Jun-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the infatuation with the automated build pipelines...

[21-Jun-19 06:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not worthless, but not effective at stopping the recent type of attack

[21-Jun-19 07:00 PM] marrych#9888
If they had humor they would name after the virus #zerobalance instead of zeroday

[21-Jun-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
"airgapped" meaning a computer that never is connected to the internet

[21-Jun-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
should be called "netgapped"

[21-Jun-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but somehow airgapped is the name for it

Even way back in the early 1970s, the really sensitive data was kept on a machine that had its own room, and the only way to bring data in or take it out was on magnetic tape..    No phone line, etc.

airgap isn't even safe anymore soon

[21-Jun-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Jun-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a pain though, you need to sync up the chain on some removable media that is connected, then physically connect it to the airgapped system so it has the current blockchain data, generate the transaction and copy it back to the online node

All the cryptocurrency users today who knows and understands a bit about cryptocurrency in my opinion are way too ahead of the rest of the population.
You also has the HUGE risk to manage what you are getting into.
For that level of huge risk you are taking, it is very important to get to know how you can secure it and keep it safe.
This industry is still at infancy, even after 9 years of BTC in existence, and user experience overall is poor. There are 100s of ways to lose cryptocurrency.
Until all these pain paints are resolved which will happen gradually and slowly as things move forward, 
no matter how difficult it seems to you all, try to learn something everyday to secure your holdings, whatever you might be holding.

[21-Jun-19 07:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm taking about the whole cryptocurrency space here. Not Komodo Platform.

[21-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Tek#5253
the moment it becomes easy and very secure / not risky is the moment easy gains are gone

[21-Jun-19 07:20 PM] Tek#5253
im guessing this will be in ~4 to 8 years

[21-Jun-19 07:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
