technically they arrest you on the airport - cause you are forced to follow the officer. This is what arrest is by definition - forced or limited moves. The thing is they probably count it as out of US or sth, idk. Or kind of blackmailing "go with us or go back". It's terrible to use it on your own citizens, how can you be not allowed to go back home ? Pretty scary.

the only way to have rights is to be wealthy enough to not use airports I guess

i guess the people cant really protest about this as that gets them a one way ticket to guantanamo, or those ships in international waters

the ussa is captured by foriegn interests at the moment. the populace is dumbed down and distracted by wine and circuses. But as things get more ridiculous, more people wake up to the fact that the country their ancestors founded is being taken from right under their noses.

I think the country was problematic from the start. The idea is nice, it looked great on paper. But the reality was gruesome and still is. Not make America great again, make it great for the first time. That is still possible.

It‚Äôs longest running federation in the history of the world.    Supplies most of the world‚Äôs humanitarian aid.  Most powerful military in the world,  world‚Äôs largest economy.   Didn‚Äôt disarm its citizens like 95% of the world.  Given an entire nation to former slaves. Seems pretty great to me.    I think it‚Äôs funny that people picture the modern day US as conquerors,   When it hasn‚Äôt even flexed a fraction of its might .

I actually think people are overestimating the military might of the US. The US is wasting a record amount of money on its military, but that doesn't mean it can win every war.   I truly doubt a war with Iran will be succesful.

Depends on how they choose to fight the war.   Scorched earth or sit and occupy.

[23-Jun-19 07:19 PM] Duck Tape#9059
The problem is: Iran is not alone. Iraq was more isolated. Libya was isolated. Iran isn't.

Iran totally doesn‚Äôt have a neighbor to its south that wants to wipe them off the face of the earth

@paul32269456 It's not necessarily going to be a "new chain", as opposed to a protocol upgrade for the current chain. It's definitely not going to be a new coin. In any case, in answer to your question, we're striving for 2021, but it'll be hard to meet that deadline!

@polycryptoblog I'm only guessing by observing. I see they move slow, like very very cautiously, may be call it too paranoia cautiously... üòÖ 
I see the Z addresses doesn't have many things we see and expect in T addresses, like multi-sig.
I also observe they work too hard on cryptography part, and are like perfectionists.
Where perfection is sometimes a blessing it can also turn curse, depending on how much level they do.
They have already kept the network on transparent transactions enough long that now when they will go to full Z transactions, it at least still won't be a match of privacy of PIRATE.
But anyway.... looking forward to their development. At least rest of the forks gets cool upgrades from these genius cryptographers üòâ

I learnt a long ago before entering cryptocurrency space, that in open source projects and in anyway in any group of people, or community don't turn away from the project if a part of them doesn't get along with you. It doesn't mean the rest of the group or community is bad, it just means that only few who did interacted with you and didn't get along with you are probably the only ones bad.
Give benefit of doubt til the actual ones leading the community work behave that same way.
