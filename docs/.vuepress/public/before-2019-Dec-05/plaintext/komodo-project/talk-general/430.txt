Game startup Komodore64 haalt € 78 miljoen op bij een bekende VC waarvan de naam pas later bekend wordt gemaakt. De startup, gevestigd te Den Haag, is pas 4 maanden oud en ontwikkelt een gameplatform en games op basis van blockchain technologie. Blockchain zou valsspelen on...

"Game startup Komodore64 raises € 78 million from a famous VC whose name will only be announced later"

[11-Sep-19 06:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One community member =|= confirmation.    As much as I respect Komodoworld... wait for the tweet and press release that can be confirmed by GS.  
Anything else is heresay at best.

what does ”VC” stand for

Venture Capital

Unless there's verifiable info, like Fishyguts says, it's not worth discussing, IMO

[11-Sep-19 06:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I disagree.

[11-Sep-19 06:53 PM] yorklab#7270
I agree. Until things can be verified and there is some follow through, everything they say is just words.

[11-Sep-19 06:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You must keep an eye on both possibilities otherwise you’re subject to confirmation bias

[11-Sep-19 06:54 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I agree on that, Fishy, but as far as I can tell everything is being said over and over again... No new info.

[11-Sep-19 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Show me the blockchain code.  That’s all I care about.

[11-Sep-19 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hard to support another gaming company startup.

[11-Sep-19 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How is that harsh?

[11-Sep-19 06:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You make a blockchain based gaming company, show me the chain.

I put 1000kmd toward a demo that has yet to be released... 6 months later.

Not into K64... as a bounty that was never materialized.

[11-Sep-19 06:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No... and I knew you’d say that which is why I wrote “not into K64”

[11-Sep-19 06:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Paid directly to Sam.  I have no recourse.

[11-Sep-19 06:57 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Better question, why is this still a topic?

[11-Sep-19 07:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am not complaining.  I’m being as nice as I can to say I have no evidence of any blockchain code or efforts to make it happen.

conspiracy theory time: (1) those who say there is proof, maybe met in the GS Milan office lobby and actors in suits were hired to talk to them 😂  or (2) K64 is possibly owned by a corporation with many umbrella companies, and that corporation is striking a deal with GS

[11-Sep-19 07:08 PM] dan.#2473
honestly? there hasnt been any proof for or against it yet.  The issue is that the GS funding numbers are outlandish.

[11-Sep-19 07:08 PM] dan.#2473
Yet, multiple people seemed to have seen proof and signed an NDA

if there is any significant amounts for the "will happen" side, i can escrow

[11-Sep-19 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
without that, there isnt much point

[11-Sep-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
likely the "will happen" side will get 10x or higher odds, which means the "wont happen will get 1.1x odds or less

[11-Sep-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you are a K64 believer, this is free money! 10x your bet basically guaranteed

Community support shouldn’t make or break a project if tech development is the goal. 

If a blockchain community is gong to support a gaming project it should have a blockchain attached.  Otherwise the community support needs to come from gaming communities.

[11-Sep-19 08:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If a gaming project is looking for support from a blockchain community ONLY, there is something flawed in that logic.   If that isn’t obvious, I don’t know what to tell any of you.
