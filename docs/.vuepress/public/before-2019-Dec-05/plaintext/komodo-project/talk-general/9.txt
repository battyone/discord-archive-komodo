[17-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k>

[17-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> you could check the checksum

[17-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <passcombo.com> hacker can also replace the checksum right ?

[17-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> luckly JL knows this could be a problem so we have like 3 places to check

[slack] <passcombo.com> new version of wallet

[17-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> ofc he can

[17-Jun-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <passcombo.com> best maybe to check several ann channels to confirm the new version is right

[17-Jun-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <passcombo.com> like twitter, slack, bitcointalk

[17-Jun-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> there are software out there the let you see if the new "software" is acting different then others

[17-Jun-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> you can publish checksum and hash on blockchain as KV pair

[17-Jun-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763

not possible

[18-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah was trying that

[18-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont see the option on mobile either, so probably not supported

[18-Jun-18 10:56 AM] ASKz#1905

Well dang, I had an image I wanted to share. Read an article about Metahash and a trail for their "lightening fast" protocol that can handle 60k transactions a second. I commented about Komodo and the current scaling to go to 1 MILLION transactions per second.

[18-Jun-18 03:23 PM] aFastHero#2811
Why does it seem that every BTC/Blockchain news outlet does not cover actual working tech in regards to some of they other articles that are being pushed. Its like they are being deceptive in their publishing...or maybe I am just extremely bias....

[18-Jun-18 03:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@aFastHero I looked for MetaHash technical whitepaper but it's still to be published, they call their consensus system Multi-PoS

[18-Jun-18 03:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
without info it's hard to say anything about it

[18-Jun-18 03:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
as for the crypto media, they're almost all a pile a of shilling-my-bags crap

[18-Jun-18 03:50 PM] aFastHero#2811
I feel it is quite a bold statement to make without having anything to back it. I find it to be counter-productive to make big claims without offering anything of value. Seems to happen all too often.

taking forever to show up in Bittrex. 120 confirmations?

The wonders of centralized exchanges.

[18-Jun-18 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
120 confirms is the result of shitcoins getting listed and their own networks aren't able to resist double spends against a 0.001BTC rental, so most all equihash coins now have insane conf times on most centralized exchanges

[18-Jun-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the better solution would have been to require coins to be listed only if they can't be broken for $5 worth of rentals üò£

$KMD on social $SEND platform. sending KMD to FB friends twitter followers and family would make things much easier to explain.

[19-Jun-18 07:53 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
actually sending to anybody should be doable different ways., even when people do not have a wallet, right? like generating QR code / scan of paper wallet ?

[19-Jun-18 07:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
we could imagine a service that sends encrypted email, where you could have "keys/scan/QR code", you send the amount to the service + email address of recipient -> service prepares QR/image of paper wallet/ or kind of code to online wallet -> sends to recipient -> and deletes from memory üòÉ

[19-Jun-18 07:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this way you could even send to someone not having actual wallet

Notarynodes mentionned. Just watched 1 or 2 min of the video. That seems very familiar to our vocabulary.

Not sure if what we should expect is a potential partner or a potential : we invented it

[19-Jun-18 08:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
As i can t watch the full video atm that was my feeling. But I told myself : don t act like a fanboy and maybe this is a partnership not announced yet. But the fact that they claim : our chief invented this solution just made me sceptical

[19-Jun-18 08:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
History of notarization is just public by looking at blockchain. The only problem is people just trust conferences / videos etc. Not facts.

[19-Jun-18 08:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Exactly my thoughts. Hard not to get on the 'first' bandwagon. I wonder whether Komodo promotes itself to other coins like this. Or just advertises what capability it has and waits for the coins to come to it.

[19-Jun-18 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Things are hopefully happening on kmd side behind the scene. To me the only answer to this should come from community
