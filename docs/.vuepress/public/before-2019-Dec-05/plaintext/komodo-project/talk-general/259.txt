Ok ...so how to get picture on how those service providers are doing ..what are their growth numbers ...and how we can bring more service providers ... I believe those service providers are helping businesses...so what sort of businesses are coming to them...are they able to fullfill businesses needs ..how information flows between service providers and main project..as they are on front and approaching businesses and getting usecases ...is there any need to get more service onboard.....

How komodo as platform add functionality ...is that based on clients feedbacks ...and other than asset chain what other areas we need to focus which can help komodo platform adoption

[10-Apr-19 09:55 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Who is responsible for komodo as product for businesses? How that works ...who talks to businesses and work with them?

[10-Apr-19 09:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ I found this thing called LABS :abusedsmily:

[10-Apr-19 10:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
For service provider numbers , you would have to ask the service provider in question.  Mainly new coin and DPoW inquires, but some whitelabel requests as well.    Most needs can be fulfilled ,  more intensive projects are on the sideline until we get our own things out there. Information flows between the required parties with as little hops along the way.  Always need more service providers on board ,  currently documentation is being written to aid people in that.    Functionality added typically upon request or whatever the devs feel they want to implement . Areas we need to focus on are dumbing down our language as much as possible,  creating free blockchain based applications.  Coordinate simple marketing efforts with the community

[10-Apr-19 10:16 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I will create a doc ..full of questions and share . Then we can discuss on that ...those will be basic questions yet Important

[10-Apr-19 10:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Sure , I‚Äôll answer them

[10-Apr-19 10:22 PM] PTYX#6840
What sort of information are you looking for in regards to providers?

[10-Apr-19 10:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap Steve lee might be one to talk to, but maybe there is a language barrier here?

[10-Apr-19 10:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
KMD doesn't have providers,  It's decentralized like ETH.

[10-Apr-19 10:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes...will talk to Steve more about it ...

[10-Apr-19 10:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
As per my understanding ..tech needs to produtify to solve real business problems..

So basic questions
What problem komodo platform solve for  businesses which can help it's token value...

What is our niche ...

Who is potential customer/user 

What are very obvious usecases..

How using komodo impact businesses/users,

[10-Apr-19 10:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Lets compare KMD to ETH... to find Comparables.

[10-Apr-19 10:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Cool

[10-Apr-19 10:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The two largest probelms on ETH, Gas fees and scaling. 
Komodo solves both, immediately.

[10-Apr-19 10:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Wait

[10-Apr-19 10:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No chain or dev has to struggle with gas fees and scalability is literally unlimitied with the side chain architecture.

[10-Apr-19 10:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So assuming businesses or anyone wantrs to use ETH, they can receive a stronger, safer, more secure ecosystem with KMD.

thought you were selling vbk fishyguts.. never answered me on buying it

[10-Apr-19 10:30 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Ethereum is a smart contract platform so web3 businesses are it's biggest user to drive adoption by building innovative solutions...

Is Komodo want to be a smart contract platform?

[10-Apr-19 10:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Bill P - Not me.  I didn't buy VBK.

[10-Apr-19 10:32 PM] Bill P#0322

Discord login is confusing...I end up sign-up.multiple.times

[10-Apr-19 10:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap - Smart contracts on KMD are UTXO based and more versatile, and supposedly easier to program than ETH based smart contracts.

We as service providers try to give sense to all that komodo is to prospect businesses and individuals that approach komodo

[10-Apr-19 10:44 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Do you document when you talk to any potential customer?

[10-Apr-19 10:44 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I wanna have a look on it

[10-Apr-19 10:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The big difference that kmd offers is the capability of creating your own blockchain infrastructure that you manage yourself.

[10-Apr-19 10:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Document? Other than chat logs, and inquiries or quotes. Not much more.

[10-Apr-19 10:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also if i have documents on the specifics of every client, i wont share them.

[10-Apr-19 10:46 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
That I know ..I am not asking questions what komodo do ...rather more...process of  komodo community , development and ecosystem growth

[10-Apr-19 10:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is all about networking and knowing who is who in the community mostly. Experience you only acquire with being present.

[10-Apr-19 10:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
There are not strict structures in komodo ecosystem.

I might be completely off, and don't have the time to sift through the channel. But i read some rumors of Pivx switching their chain over to Komodo. Is any of this true ?

[11-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Keppie#5156
They have their own chain, no ?
