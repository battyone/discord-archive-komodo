do i need to switch over from Verus Agama Wallet to the KomodoOceanQT for windows?  the KomodoOceanQT seems to be the only choice on the komodo website?

[02-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
why do you need to switch over?

[02-Jul-19 03:42 PM] sbucks#9553
@Gordon Komodo not certain that i do, just noticed that the only choice on the KMD website is KomodoOceanQT.  that is why i asked the question.

I don't see KMD or any coin built on Komodo on the Coingate list, it would be great if they were added:

Antara & Rebrand AMA
Antara Framework & Rebrand AMA July 2nd, 2019    Komodo is an open, modular multi-chain platform with blockchain development roots going back to 2014. Since Komodo is a fork of Zcash, it started its journey as a privacy-oriented project, but has since expanded far beyond that...

I was wondering, with the release of antara, is there going to be browser interactivity for dApps? Or is it all wallet based applications?

[02-Jul-19 07:53 PM] LocoMB#8593
sorry to say- but maybe better here in a not so sensitive env than elsewhere:
it is called _tera_, not terra - terra is latin for earth, tera is greek prefix for 10 to the power of twelve - as in kilo, mega, giga, .. tera
if you do this with the wrong audience, you can just as well save your breath and go home

@LocoMB luckily it was just in this quick post here in Discord and not anywhere else. Must be a language thing, I messed that up like everytime recently. Thank god for proof readers 😄

[02-Jul-19 08:06 PM] Laban#8836
Darn, am I to late for the AMA? well here’s my question anyway!
From a technical standpoint Komodo/Antara looks amazing. But why should the average person (non Developer) care about Antara/Komodo besides basic pump and dump greed? 
The reason I’m into cryptos is to be on the right side of history while FIAT-money erodes, so what’s the priority of making KMD token spendable as a means of exchange?
Is there or will there be a official spokesperson for Antara/Komodo?

those figures are a bit out of date, no more BCH, only 350 BTC

Chips value seems a bit low as well, thought that traded at 0,1kmd or so?
