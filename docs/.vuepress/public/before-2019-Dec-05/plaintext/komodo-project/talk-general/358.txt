On the kmd explorer the last transaction was on the 7th of june  for 0.00020055

[10-Jun-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just send all those funds to your new address that you put in claim form

[10-Jun-19 05:59 PM] markuk#2735
I had to put a new cliam form in with a new adress again has KomodoOceanQT was crash and the adims tried to fix it but no joy

[10-Jun-19 05:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@markuk thats fine just make the transaction to the claim address that you have access to and submitted the latest

[10-Jun-19 06:00 PM] markuk#2735
how long after I do it the funds come back

[10-Jun-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i do daily refunds processing with the latest data

[10-Jun-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so the day after you get everything done consistently

[10-Jun-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
though after this week, i will go a weekly cycle, so it is best to get the claims done ASAP

[10-Jun-19 06:02 PM] markuk#2735
I sent the kmd to the new wallet

[10-Jun-19 06:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if your claims are consistent and support has cleared it, then it will be processed tomorrow

[10-Jun-19 06:03 PM] markuk#2735
nice

[10-Jun-19 06:03 PM] gcharang#6833

another thing marketing could use is using blockchain to process non-test real-life claims

was there any kind of these historically before ?

Hi Guys, since the recent issue my version of Agama wallet crashed. I'm on Win10, and the wallet version is 0.3.6b-beta. When I open it in Lite version I get the briefest glimpse of the screen, then it literally goes blank and I'm left with a white screen for the app. Any idea how to resolve this?

Hello  developers, are you still working with sin\ suqa?

[11-Jun-19 05:35 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Any advice on how to decide between Komodo vs Verus to launch a blockchain?
Any important elements to consider when making the choice?

[11-Jun-19 05:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo assetchain is cheaper for DPoW

[11-Jun-19 05:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Verus will have meegemining

[11-Jun-19 05:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Merge

[11-Jun-19 05:42 AM] Alright#0419
@D2D privacyalternatives.com from what I understand about VRSC, it will be limited to CCs approved by VRSC dev team. Other than that, it seems to be a very solid solution

[11-Jun-19 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
Also a "komodo assetchain" is really just "a really simple way to make a customized BTC fork". An assetchain doesn't have to be tied to KMD in any way, but this is not the case for VRSC's pbaas

[11-Jun-19 05:49 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
One of the advantages of launching on Komodo would be that it can be done now, without waiting for the mainnet.
But there are some interesting things on Verus, like Merge Mining. In a video I watched there is also the Reserve mentioned, but have to research how that works.

[11-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
based entirely on what I've read about Pbaas so far, I think Pbaas will be easier to use and setup, but it will have a limited feature set compared to komodo based chains

[11-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
so easier to use, but less freedom in what you can do

[11-Jun-19 05:50 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK

[11-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Alright#0419
the reserve thing mentioned in that video can be achieved on komodo asset chains as well

For a separate idea I have, I was wondering if it's possible to tokenise assets on komodo in a similar way to Ravencoin (but with extra features that come with Komodo such as privacy zk-snarks)

[11-Jun-19 05:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can create tokens

[11-Jun-19 05:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
TokenCC

[11-Jun-19 05:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not sure how privacy features work with it though

[11-Jun-19 05:56 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
My idea would be to launch a project, and each token represents a share of the profits so it would be considered a security token. But I only like Komodo because it has privacy features, which I think are essential, nobody wants their money/coins/shares to be public I think.

[11-Jun-19 05:57 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
There are many projects offering this, but none of them offer privacy features

[11-Jun-19 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
Tokens CC has no privacy features

[11-Jun-19 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
nor do any CCs as of yet

[11-Jun-19 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
you can simply create a blockchain with ac_private and use the base coin as the token

[11-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
you don't need to have the tokens on a separate blockchain

[11-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
K64 is an example of a "token" that is it's own blockchain. You could do something like this and just add zk-SNARKs(forced privacy or optional privacy)

[11-Jun-19 06:00 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Probably both, to offer a choice - some people care more about privacy, some might need full transparency for their needs

[11-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Alright#0419
do you need multiple tokens or only one?

[11-Jun-19 06:00 AM] Alright#0419
if it's a single token, it's dead simple to setup

[11-Jun-19 06:01 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
A single token for a product

[11-Jun-19 06:02 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
So Komodo can be as good as for example Ravencoin to create tokens backed by assets?

[11-Jun-19 06:04 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Because for Raven that seems to be their main focus

[11-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
what about launching a private coin and do coin buyback burning with the profit instead?

[11-Jun-19 06:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can create your own token assetchain ( Your own ravencoin ) Or just use an assetchain coin for the ‚Äútoken‚Äù if you need only one

[11-Jun-19 06:05 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK thanks

[11-Jun-19 06:10 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Coin buyback burning with the profit sounds interesting. I'm wondering what is easier in terms of legal matters.
As they said for Ravencoin, Polymath etc, it's easy to launch a token, but you still need lawyers for contratcs etc, it's much more complicated than just launching a utility token.

[11-Jun-19 06:11 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

But that's for a separate project. My first question (Komodo vs Verus) was for a utility token

For many kinds of work there are three phases:

1. When nothing's working.

2. When it's working, but only your initial users/audience realize that.

3. When everyone knows it works.

Phase 2 is the most fun. Enjoy it while it lasts, because you'll miss it in phase 3.

KMD definitely in phase 2

[11-Jun-19 06:51 AM] Malti#3948
Initiating phase 3

[11-Jun-19 08:58 AM] gobi#1545
I have received my refund for the two affected addresses I've submitted. Submission was at approx 1200 Zulu and refunded at 1300 Zulu last night. Quick and snappy. Thanks James.

[11-Jun-19 08:59 AM] gobi#1545
(I say last night because I'm +10 timezone, so it was late for me)

[11-Jun-19 09:04 AM] gobi#1545
KMD only, of course. I'm waiting for an update on whatever new form is coming related to assets before moving forward with those.

[11-Jun-19 09:05 AM] gobi#1545
Though if you've made a claim against a particular KMD address, by default would it be difficult to autoclaim all assets that were also linked to the same address?

[11-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible, but people that used exchange address would lose those coins

[11-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so we are requiring a separate claim for assetchains

[11-Jun-19 09:05 AM] gobi#1545
of course, exchange addresses.

[11-Jun-19 09:06 AM] gobi#1545
forgot about that chestnut

[11-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also ledger and most wallets dont support all assetchains

[11-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i am about to start sending the dust to some of the assetchains.

[11-Jun-19 09:07 AM] gobi#1545
to confirm, are we still waiting on a new form or are the current set in play?

[11-Jun-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
each assetchain has its own form

[11-Jun-19 09:11 AM] gobi#1545
yeah, just you mentioned last night a "new" form - if it's the ones that are already published that's all good

[11-Jun-19 09:12 AM] peddycb#5889
I have specified several addresses with kmd and assets...but only in one application, at the very beginning.. Do I have to fill out a new one now?

[11-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the easiest is to use the existing forms. making changes would make it require additional manual review and delays

[11-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
@peddycb i would contact support to clarify your specific situation. i have not asked for any claim data for assetchains yet, that will be later this week

[11-Jun-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i am just getting my side ready to process the refunds, and the first step is sending out the smartdust

[11-Jun-19 09:16 AM] peddycb#5889
where can I find it? komodoplatform .com ?

SUPERNET and MSHARK smartdust sent out

[11-Jun-19 09:59 AM] kp#3190
@jl777c was my supernet disputed? havent received anything.... addr is RWt41RreJ5hrf18Qt3aDBNHYCa6xSukkLM

[11-Jun-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a new address, no history

[11-Jun-19 10:00 AM] kp#3190
oh sorry

[11-Jun-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
smartdust sent to old address

[11-Jun-19 10:00 AM] kp#3190
u meant the dust

[11-Jun-19 10:00 AM] kp#3190
gotcha

[11-Jun-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
this is just where KMD was on friday, i dont have any claims data, so cant do any refund processing

[11-Jun-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but i wanted to get all the dust sent out first so i am not switching between sending the dust and refunding

[11-Jun-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
confusing enough and easy to make a mistake juggling all these chains

[11-Jun-19 10:02 AM] kp#3190
yeah i can imagine

[11-Jun-19 10:02 AM] kp#3190
the thing is, i chose different refund wallets for SUPERNET and KMD

[11-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont matter

[11-Jun-19 10:03 AM] kp#3190
ok so i just send the dust from my old SUPERNET to my refund addr?

[11-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont compare to KMD addresses, i compare where the smartdust goes vs the claim data

[11-Jun-19 10:03 AM] kp#3190
i just received the dust

[11-Jun-19 10:03 AM] kp#3190
okay

[11-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
plz dont be asking when the refunds will happen
