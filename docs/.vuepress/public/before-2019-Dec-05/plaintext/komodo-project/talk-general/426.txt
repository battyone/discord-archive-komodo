@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Permit me to clear a few things up:
1. If you think that me "begging" as you call it is easy, it isn't. Coming on bended knee and encouraging people to tip you is not an enjoyable pastime.
2. If I wasn't persistent I would get much less by way of tips
3. I have never known (with one exception) what bounty I would receive for my longer format reviews before I publish them. I ask the client to pay what they think it deserves.
4. I am not remunerated in any way for shorter format articles like the one in question, save for community tipping
5. The state of crypto-journalism is a total mess since 90% of all content is cheerleading puff pieces sponsored by the project they review
6. You making comments like "encourages but doesn't tip" is entirely unhelpful, and comparing me to a beggar is a foul and malicious insult.

[08-Sep-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I ask the client to pay what they think it deserves.`
Then whatever you got should be sufficient.
`You making comments like "encourages but doesn't tip" is entirely unhelpful`
Your unedited comment was "encourage me and tip me".
I don't tip writers, but offered encouragement, I can't help that you're offended by encouragement 🤷🏽 
`and comparing me to a beggar is a foul and malicious insult.`
What other term would you find less offensive to describe the electronic equivalent of panhandling?

You can continue to take this personally and we can go on until someone bans one/both of us or you can accept that I offered encouragement and found mutiple requests for funds from the community to be uncouth 🤷🏽

[08-Sep-19 11:15 AM] gigamesh#3544
Youre an NN operator right?

[08-Sep-19 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that has what to do with what?

[08-Sep-19 11:18 AM] gigamesh#3544
1. you provide a service for which you are paid? 2. you look for community support in the form of votes during elections, yes?

[08-Sep-19 11:18 AM] gigamesh#3544
that you are in fact akin to a crypto-politician?

[08-Sep-19 11:20 AM] gigamesh#3544
yet you call me beggar?

[08-Sep-19 11:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you look for community support in the form of votes during elections, yes?`
Did you actually **see** any of my vote solicitations? They were ludicrous.  Do you think I took that spam process seriously? If so, then you might want to scroll back to the plethora of comments I made about it last year.

[08-Sep-19 11:21 AM] gigamesh#3544
the fact remains crypto-journalism is in a poor state and sponsored arttcles dont help "truth". If you have a better solution for remuneration by all means DM me

[08-Sep-19 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`trying to win a popularity contest?`
Have you met me or read anything I've ever written? If so, how dafuq did you come up with that silly idea?

@Deleted User Let me ask you this:
Other than the single sentence about the "borrowed" phone app screenshots (and swapping the words "RICK and "MORTY" for "BEER" and "PIZZA"), what' in there that's "journalism" (more specifically that wouldn't actually be better if it were a copy/paste article about BarterDEX over a year ago)?

[08-Sep-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's literally multiples more words defending asking for coinage for the article than the article contains

[08-Sep-19 11:59 AM] gunner375#7134
Hey everyone, I just came across Block DX for the first time today, an atomic swap dex from Blocknet. Does anything know of an article or comparison of it vs AtomicDex? Would be interesting to see the differences, pros and cons of each..

`The new needs friends`
I'm asking as a reader:
Other than the phone app, what's different about it than the entire time I've been a member of the community?
According to that article, like nothing 🤷🏽

[08-Sep-19 12:01 PM] gunner375#7134
it's a genuine question

[08-Sep-19 12:01 PM] gunner375#7134
Big fan of KMD and AtomicDex

[08-Sep-19 12:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@gunner375 good idea can you do it

[08-Sep-19 12:04 PM] gunner375#7134
One big difference I can already see is that Block Dex don't have an android / iOs app

[08-Sep-19 12:04 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We won't tip tho

[08-Sep-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is there any package in the npm basket that block-dx **doesn't** use? 🤦🏽

[08-Sep-19 12:05 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Oh shit

[08-Sep-19 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i didn't understand your question.`
You said "the new needs friends", I'm saying that that article tells me nothing of the new
If I read that as a non-active community member, I'd merely think it was a shill for the phone app and that nothing else is new

Having had a prominent member, literally, announce publicly at one point that he refused to work with me on any project ever, I find it a little difficult to find sympathy in this conversation 🤷🏽

[08-Sep-19 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I offered my encouragement and somehow that was offensive 🤷🏽

[08-Sep-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, I've gotten tips and prizes here and there but have only ever actually gotten paid directly for 1 thing the entire time I've been here. So, it's not like I'm without empathy

If those paragraphs had appeared in this Washington Post technology section (assuming there is such a thing) would you still make that remark? Perhaps. I take your point but short format with key info and links to the app is also of service. Instead it appeared on a popular crypto news network. I have no idea how many engagements or impressions TDC got or how many people linked to the app from the story. But I do know that tweet I made from my account of only 250 followers managed this (updated): https://i.imgur.com/wm9aABY.png

`Im still working out how to make money from from this writing gig,`
Step 1) Don't take comments, rejections, and/or dislikes personally
Step 2) Create content that fully informs users (the use of some external links is good, but fully engage the reader and shy away from having it feel like an ad)
Step 3) Have patience and followers will come if you follow the above steps

Yesterday I had a dispute with a community member, an NN operator, who gave me a hard time. He compared me with a beggar and then had the temerity to have a dig about my atomicDEX article in TDC being short, and thus unworthy of recognition. 

I come back here today to inform you that the anger this community member caused me has been fuelled in a creative way. I noted that @KomodoPlatform on twitter got 90 RT's for its atomicDEX public beta tweet, and that mine was lagging behind with 58 RT's. 

I added a 100 ARRR bounty if I could garner 100 RT's. That target should be met shortly and in the meantime **I am proud to say my tweet has now exceeded the official Komodo twitter account in terms of RT and Likes. I out-Komodo'ed KOMODO.

I did not come here today to "beg". I came here to run my victory lap and to send a message.**
