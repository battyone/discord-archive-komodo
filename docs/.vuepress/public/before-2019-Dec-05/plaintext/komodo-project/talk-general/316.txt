If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out

Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

SPV servers don‚Äôt work on verus

[05-Jun-19 03:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
How do I change the servers?

[05-Jun-19 03:48 AM] cipi#4502
@Hollowman9000 Agama from VRSC can not use the SPV servers (other than VRSC), because it is old code that does not work with new servers

Is this being actively attacked, is this just a precaution or what‚Äôs happening?

Do I go home and log in using seed (is that safe?) and then send out ASAP? Should I be leaving work early to go home a few hours in advance to do this, or is this important but not get it done ASAP important

agama is the only wallet affected by this

[05-Jun-19 05:20 AM] keda666#1678
If you used Agama LITE mode you're not safu

[05-Jun-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
if you used agama, lite or native mode, it is best to move the funds to a fresh new address

[05-Jun-19 05:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Even pirate?

every coin, if you used agama under the certain timeline, is affected i would assume.

[05-Jun-19 05:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I mean the verus agama

[05-Jun-19 05:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Everything that is available with same seed is needed to move out from that wallet.

[05-Jun-19 05:23 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was said earlier that verus agama was safe

[05-Jun-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810

Pretty simple

[05-Jun-19 06:32 AM] t0sma#0368
Or Use Magnum Wallet with LEDGER.
