`a lot of the coins in the top 100`

we shouldn't objectify women like this. just because she is unzipping her pants and took her shirt off does not mean she is looking for this kind of attention.

I agree with @jl777c   comment earlier about DEX and how it will develop and gain users as traction  takes place it will be "unstoppable" , all one has to do is think about the large colossal  amount of capital/ money that will like to trade but dont have the required KYC document because of where they were born or location etc , this group or population is the majority of the world , now they can with just a mobile, again which most of them have, isn't that what tech is about giving people with less the leverage to do more ,  and then add on top of that people who do have all the kyc doc however want better security for their asset from hacks etc  oh and you can trade between 95% of the coin out there,  I also believe DEX asset is likely to reach a "Billion"or so maybe not as early as some people say but there can be surprises , also and DEX in not exactly based on a location so Gov banning is impractical, it like banning google in china other jurisdiction in the world will allow it ,  so DEX it the ultimate asset that can earn you profit anywhere in the world , wont be surprised if whales start accumulating aggressively when moble DEX is launched  so yes a billion dollar DEX valuation is possible

before this happens we will see hybrid CEX/DEX platforms @willofleo  - it 's going to be a loooong process in which CEX liquidity moves into the DEX networks - in the first stage its going to be like a scaling weigh that slowly equilibrates. But dont expect the vanishing of CEXs - DEXs will instead become more like CEXs - with centralized gateways and 'entrypoints' (e.g. "dextrade.kmd.io") - as you can see, the coexistence between both forms is the key to success of DEX technology as such.

Dirty BTC coins on the XMR market?
This both serves as a buyer beware and a need for advice.  TLDR: I sold XMR for BTC on bisq, transferred it to 2 different exchanges and both accounts independently got locked in the past 2 months.  Before I hear that I should stay away from exchanges, I know, I know already....

Yes I agree there is going to be a transition point from one to the other , the same happened with cars and horses , and it one direction CEX to DEX, I agree it a loong term process but long in tech it kinda short , facebook,Uber, wattapp  took roughly 4 years , some less to reach that large tipping point , DEX doesn't  need to collect all of CEXs volume to be a large volume exchange  there is also in flow of volume from the excluded  participant  and inflow of volume for project launching on the DEX bringing their community and users DEX just need to be able to handle the mass inflow,

everyone  **Security Alert**: if you created or used your seed phrase with Agama please deinstall it, stop using it and immediately rotate your seeds and move all your coins out from there (to a different seed - which was NOT created with Agama) - if you know what you are doing please use either cold-storage (paper-wallets, offline storage, ...), the KomodoOcean wallet or komodo-cli. We will provide you an alternative desktop wallet very soon. If you need assistance please reach out to our support team: #support.
Our team will provide you all details of the incident in the coming days. 
This does only affect seeds that were used or created with Agama for Desktop, Mobile or Browser.

[05-Jun-19 01:13 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how do i get a new seed?

[05-Jun-19 01:15 AM] PTYX#6840
@FlyingDutchman you can use magnum wallet, guarda wallet, and Chameleon Pay or any of the other wallets to generate a seed and move funds.

[05-Jun-19 01:15 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
okay
