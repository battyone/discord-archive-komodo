Does anyone know if there is an algorithmic Euro stable coin in the Komodo ecosystem being built?

I may launch an assetchain soon, can I get the details and prices for notarization, and I'd need the approx time that will be needed for the brand new assetchain to be notarized, security first . Is there an official price somewhere ?

[28-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
any official dev available ?

[28-Aug-19 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
I read it can be done on composer, but I'll save costs using a DIY solution, I just need to get the cost for 1 year of nota, was approx 300KMD a few monthes away, did the price evolve, or can I base myself on it ?

I know the meetup is soon, but I have a killing app and PoC I'd love to demonstrate there, am organizing my venue atm, but I need the asset to be notarized üò¶

[28-Aug-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
won't need it on any wallet, this asset, or maybe double assets will be very special, am still refining details, but I'm sure you'll love it ^^

[28-Aug-19 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I, fact, I had an Idea that could be so excellent, but can't talk about it yet, don't want this idea to be used, as I'm sure it s really really a killer implementation, and I have so much luck that noone thought about it yet ^^

[28-Aug-19 12:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
official price is @Audo @polycryptoblog @Steve Lee

got my answer, a bit expensive for me, 2K5 usd üò¶ I stayed on the 300 KMD fee we asked for about a year, but it changed, I ll see if I can gather that

[28-Aug-19 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
will be coupled with Barterlly FYI, but I won't be able to pay that 2500 USD, asked to my partners, I'll then find another solution

[28-Aug-19 01:33 PM] richardt#2807
Why did it change from 300KMD to 2500USD?

[28-Aug-19 01:39 PM] richardt#2807
It was 300 KMD a year ago

[28-Aug-19 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, if the price stayed 300KMD to just get on the repo, I d have subscribed it today tbh ^^

[28-Aug-19 01:41 PM] richardt#2807
the team must've determined that it was too low given the current KMD price

[28-Aug-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User there are various places to get notarized: Official KMD NN network, KMDLabs, SAFE or run your own network. Each network has different prices that change

@dukeleto @vhdlrband @majning @ritocoin That sounds good to me. 500K RITO bounty will be awarded. The best approach would probably be to  fork the Ritocoin repo and submit the work as a PR. We're on discord if you want to chat with us in real time! https://t.co/uNT4VT3n1G

@dukeleto unSAFE insulted James for him helping them with their KMD code forking and not knowing exactly what they been doing. You recommending that project to do notarizing to for dwy?

[28-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jorian#4555
KMDLabs isn't for that

[28-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jorian#4555
LABS is for cc testing

[28-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jorian#4555
then what's the point of having to pay for KMD NN while LABS is free

[28-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jorian#4555
LABS is not unstable

[28-Aug-19 03:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
LABS is best option to go with if KMD is not a first choice

[28-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jorian#4555
let's be more specific: LABS notarization is not unstable

[28-Aug-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if LABS is not a choice and neither KMD, then may be time to give own notary setup a try....

[28-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jorian#4555
or they ask you to pay for the unstability

[28-Aug-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
LABS isnt good because it has a very fast hardfork every 2 months...

@blackjok3r do you have the documentation to make own notary network to notarise own chain?

[28-Aug-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of....

[28-Aug-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just use stakedNotary repo and chage the ports

[28-Aug-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Entire network takes a few hours... depending on size

[28-Aug-19 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that on github? like github repo's wiki etc?

[28-Aug-19 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181

this way or another any project using KMD tech to notarise their blockchain to secure themself helps the KMD project

[28-Aug-19 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a total mess, its on git because thats the easyest way to get the code to all the nodes at once when I was testing.

[28-Aug-19 03:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's alright, you do code and test a lot!

purpose is security

[28-Aug-19 04:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The 365 kmd is just the Komodo part of notarization,  the rest has to do with running the node , maintenance  etc.

[28-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
maintenance on assetchains ? ü§î , isn't the purpose to get moar AC to reduce internal cost from notary hardware perspective ?

[28-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
first choice is obviously KMD, but tbh, I need a precedent of payment of that 2500 USD not taking into account the internal assets KMD has

[28-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
or at least an economical explanation, being a customer üôÇ

[28-Aug-19 04:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Economical explanation:   Notary nodes run your chain,   64 nodes ,  averages a little over 3 dollars per month per node at 2500.

[28-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
pros / cons of attracting people on KMD tech, and having a raw price, it should be envisionned the repercussions and incentives to integrate to KMD as a base, calculating the cost of multiple operators, hardware costs, and salaries.

[28-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
NN are already automatically paid, by the network himself, additionnal costs are required for external coins ?

[28-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
not being a troll, but as a former NN, never was proposed to handle the base listing dPow cost across operators, so I assume this doesn't go into hardware or salaries, economically speaking

[28-Aug-19 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
main objective being to have a system that will be distributed and decentralised to the max, but that's the point of elections and incentives for NN, the 300+ KMD for notas are totally normal üôÇ

[28-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
the goal being to add more and more AC, to enforce pressure on KMD buys, so I don't understand the 2k5

[28-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
(economically)

[28-Aug-19 04:47 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
If your main objective is maximize decentralization and distribution, it's worth waiting for PBaaS hitting Verus MainNet. The chain gets autonotarized into VRSC mainchain. Notarization fees basically are an incentive for (merge) mining your chain (Asidie from VRSC and your chains mining rewards).

`-connect=<ip>`  Connect only to the specified node(s) will greatly improve speed for download entire ~~bootstrap~~ blockchain.
Also you can use these options to speed up the synchronization process.
`-maxconnections=<n>`  Maintain at most <n> connections to peers (default: 384)
`-maxreceivebuffer=<n>`  Maximum per-connection receive buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 5000)
`-maxsendbuffer=<n>`  Maximum per-connection send buffer, <n>*1000 bytes (default: 1000)

[28-Aug-19 05:06 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I don't think so. I recently synchronized on LAN with my RockPi using `-connect=<IP>` and I had synchronized the entire chain within 2 hours.

[28-Aug-19 05:06 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Ofcoarse I restarted the deamon for normal operation afterwards, without the `-connect` option

[28-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
`-connect` isn't likely to speed it up

[28-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
there is a default of how much bandwidth your node will allow to a single peer

[28-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
it will hit that and stop for a while

[28-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Alright#0419
`-connect=1 -addnode=<IP> -addnode=<another IP> -addnode=<another IP>` should do it

[28-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
will basically `-connect=` to those 3(or more) nodes and you'll be less likely to hit that bandwidth limit

[28-Aug-19 05:11 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
On LAN it worked like a charm.. I will try your suggestion, since I think it will be more suitable for the general public.
