Ok we just had to mirror the subscript to get the exponent!

Am I missing something or was it mirrored on both the vertical and horizontal axis? Surely a mirror is only on one axis?

MW is promising new tech, but has issues to overcome. just like any other project.
at the moment it requires to have both sender/receiver online at the same time for payments to go through. so IP addresses are possibly a weak spot to exploit

Crypto-Anarchist Shot Dead in Mexico's Murder Capital Ahead of Ana...
A crypto-anarchist who went by the name "John Galton" was gunned down and killed in his home in Acapulco, Mexico two weeks ahead of the Anarchapulco conference in what seems like a drug trade-related killing.

I took a bus ride with the BCH abc creator and had no idea who he was until months later. There was alot of cool and like minded people. The customer service was horrible and the hotel had no idea what they were doing. Rooms that I paid were "not available" then 30 minutes later they became available. There were 2 earthquakes during the conference üòÇ

Hey there community, recently the Magnum team released the claim option for Ledger. However, some users meet problems both with importing wallets from the ledger device and claiming, because we haven't tested these features with different browsers a lot. I hope those people who met these troubles can forgive us and give one more chance to our wallet. We do our best to resolve these issues asap and I'd like to thank everyone who told us about their errors.
