ok so days to get an address

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@nocturnal then what is the problem with Verus Agama?

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
when i create new address

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
enter my pin

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
says only alphanumeric characters allowed

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] nocturnal#2177
no matter what i put in (i am only using alphanumerics)

[07-Jun-19 09:22 PM] KanarDMD#9092
Turned off proxy on versus and can‚Äôt connect

[07-Jun-19 09:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@nocturnal just enter 10 alphabet with no spaces or special characters

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@KanarDMD are you sure you are using the 0.6 version?

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
"10alphabet" ?

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
like that?

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
or you mean 10 letters?

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
that should work, but now everybody knows you pin üòÑ

[07-Jun-19 09:26 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah try that
i suggested  10 letters and nothing else
just try anything
I just created a wallet with no problem

[07-Jun-19 09:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
it has to be 10 letters? it doesnt say that anywhere

[07-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
alphanumerics mean letters and numbers

[07-Jun-19 09:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes thats what i did

[07-Jun-19 09:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
many times... :/

[07-Jun-19 09:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
will try again after re-install

[07-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe you forgot to name your wallet

[07-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
after the pin then pin confirmation, then name your wallet using only alphanumerics

[07-Jun-19 09:28 PM] gcharang#6833
@nocturnal yes, name your wallet
it shouldn't contain spaces too

[07-Jun-19 09:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
there is no box that says wallet name

[07-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes , there is a line below

[07-Jun-19 09:29 PM] nocturnal#2177
is it cleverly called something completely different?

[07-Jun-19 09:29 PM] gcharang#6833
custom pin file name

[07-Jun-19 09:29 PM] nocturnal#2177
Most confusing wallet

Yes, I'm using Version 0.6.0-13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview-Tech-Preview-02 (0.6.0)

[07-Jun-19 09:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@KanarDMD using VPN? firewall?
were you able to connect at all before?

[07-Jun-19 09:32 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I can see the small amount that was deposited in the KMD explorer.  Just can't get Agama to work

[07-Jun-19 09:32 PM] KanarDMD#9092
none of the above

[07-Jun-19 09:32 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I haven't been able to connect since the attack on June 5

[07-Jun-19 09:32 PM] gcharang#6833
where did you create the new address?

[07-Jun-19 09:33 PM] KanarDMD#9092
my new address is on my ledger

[07-Jun-19 09:34 PM] KanarDMD#9092
I'm trying to access my compromised wallet

[07-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
have you uninstalled the old agama wallet?

[07-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe you open the wrong wallet by chance?

[07-Jun-19 09:34 PM] KanarDMD#9092
nope

[07-Jun-19 09:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@KanarDMD please check these:
1) the proxy button is grey
2) you clicked `save config`
3) close verus agama completely and then start it
if not repeat these steps now

[07-Jun-19 09:36 PM] KanarDMD#9092
same thing

[07-Jun-19 09:37 PM] KanarDMD#9092
is there another wallet I can use with my old private key?

[07-Jun-19 09:38 PM] gcharang#6833
anyway its the compromised wallet, export privkey from seed in agama
import it in any of the third party web/mobile wallets
chameleon, magnum, guarda

[07-Jun-19 09:39 PM] KanarDMD#9092
