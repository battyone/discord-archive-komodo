@monwrisold, Steve Lee is the CMO of Komodo. Komodo just partnered with ideas by nature. I'm sure they have it covered

Not just that, compare Komodo developments to pretty much every other project out there and we far outpace them.

[19-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Yeppers#0999
Hi, i have an unrelated question, is there an exchange where you can trade any coin without an official listing ?

[19-Sep-18 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BarterDEX

[19-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Yeppers#0999
A place where you propose your coins and nothing else ha to be done ?

[19-Sep-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
utopia

[19-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Yeppers#0999
I search for utopia exchange ?

[19-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Yeppers#0999
Ok i thought so

[19-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Yeppers#0999
Does BarterDEX need a listing price and so on or i can just show up with my coins and sell like OTC ?

[19-Sep-18 06:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any coin that 2 people have in their list (that works within the system) can be freely traded

[19-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Yeppers#0999
I'll go try that thanks

[19-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Yeppers#0999
I got a coin that got delisted from Cryptobridge just now and i have nowhere to sell anymore

[19-Sep-18 06:20 PM] Yeppers#0999
Seraching for options

[19-Sep-18 06:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There are some technical requirements for the swapping, but other than that, everything is "open"

[19-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Yeppers#0999
Thx

[19-Sep-18 06:27 PM] Yeppers#0999
Anyway i can check if Hera coin is listed? Cannot find a list of coins on the site

Although it can be easily added assuming it meets the technical requirements, you need to have a buyer of Hera

[19-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Yeppers#0999
it's a fork of pivx i think

[19-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Yeppers#0999

[19-Sep-18 06:35 PM] snowdamn#2414
pivx is on there

[19-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380
guys hyperdex has really low trading volume on most of the coins right?

[19-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380
that will change with MM 2.0 correct?

[19-Sep-18 06:37 PM] xRobeSx#5136
hopefully, but people still need to use it. It's possible to have higher volume now

[19-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep Im using it but theres no orders there

[19-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so my order is gonna stay forever there..

[19-Sep-18 06:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
glad to hear you're trying!

[19-Sep-18 06:39 PM] xRobeSx#5136
try to keep encouraging others

[19-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye will do hopefully things change really fast bc hyperdex really has a sick user friendly UI.

[19-Sep-18 06:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
its like a change of 180 degrees in comparison to bartedex

[19-Sep-18 06:42 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes HyperDEX gui is beautiful.

[19-Sep-18 06:48 PM] Alright#0419
@moneyisold what relation do you have to RVN?

[19-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
and if you think KMD is a "solo project" you're very incorrect

[19-Sep-18 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
scroll down on the channels list, see all the ones under `ECOSYSTEM (3RD PARTY)`?

[19-Sep-18 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
All projects built on KMD tech or collaborative projects

[19-Sep-18 06:51 PM] Alright#0419
plenty of others that we work with that don't have their own dedicated channel too

[19-Sep-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
That guy isn't even in the RVN discord. Troll account?

Confused my mining pool just mined 1 block worth 365 coins when it’s supposed to be 3 it was done in 5 mins

[19-Sep-18 07:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lucky block that had forfeited interest

[19-Sep-18 07:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Forfeited interest goes to the miner that found the block

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep 😃

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lucky block

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] dyorguy#3319
@polycryptoblog is that really what happen

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] dyorguy#3319
That’s crazy

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
After a year when you dont claim interest it goes to the miners

[19-Sep-18 07:52 PM] dyorguy#3319
Check it it’s block 1016824

[19-Sep-18 07:53 PM] dyorguy#3319
Never seen that before thought it was a hack or something I got 20 coins in 3 mins which is my normal daily payout

[19-Sep-18 07:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Some exchanges  run their client in a mode that doesn't disperse the rewards also ledger outgoing tx too I think

[19-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So for example exchange wallets often dont claim interest or people holding kmd on hardware wallet, and then the intrest goes to the miners

[19-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hehe poly a bit faster 😃

[19-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway it’s definitely legit @dyorguy

[19-Sep-18 07:54 PM] dyorguy#3319
Ok thx is this just for Komodo or does this happen to other coins

[19-Sep-18 07:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Cryptoon  that's incorrect, after 1 year unclaimed interest doesn't accrue anymore it doesn't automatically go to miners

[19-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha i stand corrected

[19-Sep-18 07:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dyorguy  this is a Komodo feature, but other coins do have quirks too,  so DYOR guy! 😉😂

[19-Sep-18 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
no more 1 year. it is 1 month now

[19-Sep-18 07:56 PM] dyorguy#3319

[19-Sep-18 07:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Oh yes I forgot you are correct @SHossain  block 1 million has passed

[19-Sep-18 08:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It will be interesting to see how the effect of "soft" demurrage will affect price when coins are done generating. ( interest not claimed lowers coin supply,  with substantial enough demand should provide a nice increase )

[19-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the current mega block record?

[19-Sep-18 08:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10k+ kmd?
