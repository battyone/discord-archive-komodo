oh ok.

[10-May-19 05:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
OK, so now IB fucking M is actually building real  smart contracts using komodo tech and no one even cares. We should be on fire right now.

[10-May-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is up 4% in a sea of red, it is on fire

[10-May-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is between zilliqa and bittorrent, two very hyped up projects and at #50 which is on the high end of its range, this is when its price is at the low end of its range, so progress is being made

[10-May-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it just takes time

[10-May-19 05:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
has IBM offered any support or collaboration?

[10-May-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we are in the process of establishing direct contact, so far it is just the twitter posts that we all see

[10-May-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
until we establish direct contact, lets not get too excited over it

[10-May-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
more significant is the SEC guidance about money transmitters. from what we are reading, fully decentralized solutions are not regulated, but centralized dapps and centralized DEX are regulated

[10-May-19 05:40 AM] Alright#0419
probably a good time to double check licensing 😂

[10-May-19 05:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well let's hope they don't just write a big check and put everything in their pocket

Big checks are cool though.

[10-May-19 07:22 AM] az#1921
@Alecandro  @FishyGuts  Sadly, there is no Lydia working at IBM on  Komodo. Twitter, LinkedIn and ResearchGate account are fake.

[10-May-19 07:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10 years seems a long time for a catfish account

[10-May-19 07:27 AM] az#1921
Indeed. Take a deep look inside her tweet history. I'm sure you will notice something strange.

[10-May-19 07:30 AM] jeezy#3408
jl doesnt need big checks, they are already on his privkeys

[10-May-19 07:31 AM] jeezy#3408
what we need is real companies  seein real value in  real projects, like this one

[10-May-19 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@az you're right, I did notice something strange: she's religious 🤷🏽

[10-May-19 07:38 AM] az#1921
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  lol . That's not the point. The twitter account was silent for 4 years before to start talking about cryptocurrencies.  If you take a look to the research gate profil, you will notice that the academic paper present here does not belong to one person. Sometimes it's Luiza Schafer, sometimes she's in a chemistry lab, sometimes in an hospital, sometimes in a fluid mechanic lab. With the twitter account you can find evidence that she's born in 1987. The first paper on her researchgate profil is from 1995.

@az that certainly needs to be investigated but not conclusive either way

[10-May-19 08:27 AM] Lance#9742
what's the difference between tortuga and barterlly?

[10-May-19 08:27 AM] az#1921
@KomodoWorld  How a fake ResearchGate profile can not be conclusive ? You literally just have to check the name and affiliation from the different papers to conclude that it is a fake profile.

[10-May-19 08:30 AM] nocturnal#2177
i love it when btc is going up and youtube is flooded with videos saying there will be a quarter mil bitcoin by 2024 😂

[10-May-19 08:31 AM] nocturnal#2177
nice dreams for the morning

[10-May-19 08:40 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@az there's definitely something strange, I agree. Still hard to tell if it's Researchgate mistake or not. The only way is to ask IBM

[10-May-19 08:57 AM] ca333#0118
fyi - we are in contact with IBM Germany and in the process of validating those claims. We will keep you updated and notify you as soon as we get official reply.

@Lance I think Tortuga is a reskinned version of Barterlly with Pirate theme, the backend engine is the same

[10-May-19 09:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
added TOR capabilities as well, or are those implemented in barterlly as well?

[10-May-19 09:03 AM] Lance#9742
ok thanks, and do you know if they will share the same orderbook?@KomodoWorld

[10-May-19 09:03 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ah yes TOR

[10-May-19 09:05 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Barterlly doesn't have 'ordebooks' because it's for private OTC trades, there's also a public mode when you can post a sell order for anyone to take and in such case yes it will be visibile to anyone

[10-May-19 09:59 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Bartelly and Totuga look amazing

[10-May-19 10:26 AM] Mark81#4505
@ca333  maybe you could give notice to ibm lady via twitter that team is checking her backgrounds from ibm before going forward.

[10-May-19 10:28 AM] Mark81#4505
Maybe she will give some excuses for that if not present there.

IBM blockchain twitter don't follow any of htese people either

[10-May-19 01:57 PM] klein#5233
and they follow allot of people

[10-May-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@az researchgate continually asks me for free work to make the data on their platform less incorrect and I constantly ignore them. RG is not a good data source for this kind of sleuthing

[10-May-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
I read up above and haven't seen any good data to explain where there is IBM FUD spreading

[10-May-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@az so yeah, "fake rg profile" is laughable as evidence

[10-May-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't understand what people are alleging or where this is coming from

[10-May-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't understand

[10-May-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
not even sure what the picture above is supposed to prove. People tweet random junk all the time, and that tweet is from 8 years ago

[10-May-19 02:05 PM] klein#5233
no harm in being skeptical

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Sure, but founded on what?

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
A large company is, in theory, starting to use KMD tech. 3 people on twitter are talking about it, 2 dudes and 1 lady

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Why the attack on the woman?

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] az#1921
I think you just don't want to believe that you have been fooled @dukeleto . Evidence are crystal clear. Just waiting for IBM notification as @ca333  said

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Why not the other 2 dudes?

[10-May-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326

@Deleted User so what? What job did you have in 2011?

[10-May-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are a fake!

[10-May-19 02:07 PM] az#1921
I can assure you my research gate account does not give any wrong publication

[10-May-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
What I see is a bunch of dudes going after a lady in tech

[10-May-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@az you probably have an uncommon name, then

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is being alleged?

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
2 real IBM dudes are using KMD and their lady boss is faking it?

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
She is the boss of those other dudes

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] Malti#3948
i must admit it is fishy

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] Malti#3948
what are the twitter accounts of the 2 dudes

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Let's be skeptical!

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was unemployed and living in his pickup truck in 2011; he must be a fake too_

Come on @dukeleto .  Just open your eyes.

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@az what are you actually alleging?

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody is trying to pump KMD by faking IBM interest?

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] Malti#3948
where does it say taht astrohacker is an IBM employee

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] az#1921
I'm saying that the twitter account you are in loved with does not belong to someone from IBM

[10-May-19 02:09 PM] az#1921

Good. But Twitter account from Lydia Schafer is a fake one. So is the Linkedin and ResearchGate. No clue about the motivation behind this.
