The agency seem to know what they are doing, if they think option x or y is to be considered I am assuming it will be brought to the table.

[24-Aug-18 04:03 PM] joe2x4#5987
It's not like the name Komodo is any worse or better then the many bizarrely named projects. Might need to fix the Reddit page though if the term platform is dropped.

Personally, I really hate the name golem, reminds me of LordofRings, hate the name Tron, reminds me of the movie that shares the name,  but love the name bbqcoin. Grilling out is fantastic. üòã

Everything is on the table, and a rebranding is far beyond purely visual identity.

[24-Aug-18 06:50 PM] jspook16#3059
Everything on the table makes sense in order to only have to rebrand once and get the most of it I think. I really like what is happening regardless of the outcome.

Ty for the response. That makes sense that most people would probably do 1fa twice. But a hardware wallet would count as a second device, and you could have hardware wallet security for an unsupported coin. Agama doesn't have Ledger integration, but could be secured by a Ledger this way. @jl777c

Cryptoconditions are UTXO-based smart contracts + draft IETF standard implemented by jl777 on $KMD. First blockchain to do so!
Read docs about it here:
https://t.co/2RIpwDU1MD and please join us in writing Python tests   https://t.co/4evGaLybeB

Shit.. need to stop travelling and go back home to claim monthly rewards on kmd in agame wallet.. almost a month now..

[26-Aug-18 01:01 AM] ca333#0118
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies or you write a CC for the monthly reward-claim and leave it running while you re travelling - thats the elegant way. Or a python script to send your balance to yourself N times a month - thats the lazy way. but we are ignoring security aspects - If we also keep next level op/devsec in mind than you d need to do this on an offline computer - means a computer that has IR/bluetooth and can only send data but never receive it. So offline computer signs TX based on your provided infos and sends the signed raw tx to an online computer via infrared or bluetooth, and so on...

[26-Aug-18 07:01 AM] DimgDongSoLong#4467
If I get 1 KMD every week is it better to claim every 2 weeks rather than every month?

[26-Aug-18 07:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@DimgDongSoLong use this tool to calculate the difference :

1 KMD UTXO won‚Äôt do anything 
10 or more than 10 KMD UTXO will be good.
10 KMD UTXO starts accruing rewards in about 1 hour, or say in 60 block confirmation.

[26-Aug-18 09:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This should give u idea what is the minimum time limit u can wait

[26-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think he means he‚Äôs getting 1kmd a week in rewards?

[26-Aug-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That means 1 kmd utxo 
2 weeks = two 2 kmd utxo.

[26-Aug-18 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That‚Äôs why I tried clearing

[26-Aug-18 11:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Oh need to clear further 
The reward goes to a change address if using komodo-cli

[26-Aug-18 11:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If using spv then to the same address it‚Äôs generated from

[26-Aug-18 11:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In both cases if it‚Äôs 1 kmd utxo it will not accrue reward.

[26-Aug-18 04:14 PM] maki#2419
@ca333 but while sending to myself the reward from Dpos is send to change addres

[26-Aug-18 04:14 PM] maki#2419
How to change it to send it to my main address?

[26-Aug-18 04:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
if you run komodod with your -pubkey the change goes to your address

[26-Aug-18 04:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
also if you claim rewards in SPV mode it arrives at your address without address change

[26-Aug-18 04:30 PM] maki#2419
so what's the command in komodod.exe client ?

[26-Aug-18 04:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
komodod.exe -pubkey="PUBKEYTOYOURADDRESS"

[26-Aug-18 04:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
you get the pubkey by running
komodod.exe validateaddress YOURADDRESS

The third week of STAKED will begin tomorrow at 3PM UTC. If anyone is interested in learning the ins and outs of komodo and it's contracts, it's a great place to learn. Check out the #private-staked channel for more information. Purpose of the chain is to incentivize testing smart contracts and various KMD features. Find a bug, and you'll be rewarded

$KMD #KOMODO

Lovely chart here.
Potential triple bottom. 
Strong bullish divergences & volume accumulation. 

Upwards potential is mainly the orange zone if you'd swingtrading this one. 

One of the best projects out there.
