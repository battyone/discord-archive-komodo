there is absolutely no way to predict where and how this will end up. to not do it because you think it has no chance, well I will just say "decentralized games"

if decentralized games gets only 1% of the gaming market, that is $1 billion per year more usage than without decentralized games

[15-Feb-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
actually if we had it your way, we wouldnt see as you dont want to change the status quo

[15-Feb-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so while you have no chance of getting decentralized games to $1 billion per year, we do

also "long tail" @Deleted User 
there are few major hits and then there are hundreds and hundreds "less successful" niche games.

you don't necessarily need hits to make a lot of money

having a gamedev do what I did to convert ingame currency to real crypto, nonfungible player data and a DEX... well it would certainly be a lot more than 2 weeks. which means a lot of time risk. which means management will say "after the next release" but they would always say that, so it never gets done

i search blockchained games and it had a lot of links. strange since its supposed to be pointless.

[15-Feb-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
another reverse aspect is that if decentralized games requires a native mode for best gameplay results, even 11 yr olds will run full nodes, thus increasing decentralization

Lu said when looking at the history of new tech development, it usually starts with games. ‚ÄúGames are the easiest to understand and the easiest to access,‚Äù Lu said gaming is a way for dapp developers to attract users as well as to educate them about blockchain technology and why it is important.

[15-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Llama#1330
I don't think decentralization is the next big thing in gaming. I don't think anyone really cares if a game is decentralized. Most people are just looking for good games. 

I'm not saying that decentralized games can't be good, though. They are just different.

[15-Feb-19 07:21 PM] Llama#1330
and Rogue sounds super interesting

[15-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Llama#1330
game devs?

[15-Feb-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
one thing that is possible via nonfungible tokens is for other games to use tokens from other games

[15-Feb-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and the user owns the token, across games. this never possible before, so impossible to say what it leads to

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
While playing I can use tokens?

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
In real time?

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be possible to interchange players from one game to another with some conversion factor

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Llama#1330
I guess something like Steam would be cool to have

{Reactions}

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] Llama#1330
but there would need to be a good game on it

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
a game that uses tokens in realtime can use tokens in realtime

[15-Feb-19 07:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just a matter to use them

[15-Feb-19 07:24 PM] jl777c#5810

so ROGUE shows the possibilities that are possible

[15-Feb-19 07:25 PM] Llama#1330
I guess my mid is more in the area of a popular game similar to ones we already have

[15-Feb-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
and gamedevs tend to be pretty creative, so I wont try to predict what they come up with

[15-Feb-19 07:26 PM] Llama#1330
like csgo skins

[15-Feb-19 07:26 PM] Llama#1330
but *on the blockchain*

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the area that fits on blockchain are finite resources, unique game objects

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
with cross game tokens, that would have to be developed to work together from both games, right?

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
well not exactly. you can atomic swap coins from both chains

Wouldn‚Äôt it hinder gameplay if the network is slow?

[15-Feb-19 07:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so there would be some ROGUE value for playerdata, which allows playerdata -> ROGUE -> OTHER -> OTHER game item

[15-Feb-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I made it so there is ZERO impact on the rogue gameplay due to being blockchained

[15-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok

[15-Feb-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you can certainly write it in a way that is slow

[15-Feb-19 07:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is also possible to separate the gameplay from the blockchain realtime nature
