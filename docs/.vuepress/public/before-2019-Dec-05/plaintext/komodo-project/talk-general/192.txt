i give up so here's what I think - it was a second dimension

[01-Feb-19 10:18 PM] Gawain#7858
the last thing i tried was macking a blockchain of blocks 
```
428 916 753 794 183 526 645 731 298
357 428 961 563 247 189 872 694 315
916 375 842 281 569 437 139 852 674
```

[01-Feb-19 10:19 PM] Gawain#7858
also tried 
```
428916753
       6 
      8  
     3   
563247189
   5     
  5      
 7       
1        
``` 
and stuff like that

The only diff I see is that the character are getting on the second line when unhidden so maybe we need to truncate the extra characters getting on the second line when unhidden. but How do hell could we guess this without the last clue?

[01-Feb-19 10:20 PM] Gawain#7858
quite complex amount of ideas haha

[01-Feb-19 10:21 PM] ca333#0118
@Gawain nice - one specific element i only saw with you

[01-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Gawain#7858
posted this yesterday, but maybe one of these: 
`things i've tried: using diagonals, rows top to bottom or columns left to right, tried excluding given numbers, converting to letters for patterns, finding 7th numbers for row or column, using fee as key for row or columns, location of 7th number in each square, also tried sha256 of all those answers, taking double sha256 of all the answers, making qr code of every square =>7 as black, converting to base 16, 32, 56 and 64, stepping through the solution with {10(j), 12(l), 7, 7, 7} steps and same for "dpow", writing numbers that would form a giant 7`

[01-Feb-19 10:22 PM] Decker#3767
@ca333 field includes all chars when it's hidden ... you can enter 100 chars seed and it will be shown like 100 `*`, but part of them will be on right. but anyway for 100 `*` you'll need to press 100 times Del button to delete it all.

[01-Feb-19 10:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Brains of Komodo - James, this eye = revealed. Is only way to solve this puzzle is to reveal James?

[01-Feb-19 10:25 PM] TonyL#3577
🤕

[01-Feb-19 10:25 PM] zatJUM#9924
James' coming out? 😉

[01-Feb-19 10:25 PM] ca333#0118
@Gawain  you even tried new line - right?

[01-Feb-19 10:26 PM] Gawain#7858
yeah, for many of them, not sure i tried every combination of ideas

[01-Feb-19 10:26 PM] ca333#0118
no @Decker you havent tried everything.

[01-Feb-19 10:27 PM] ca333#0118
yes right - while making the puzzle i found a little feature ('bug'). and i abused it. xD

[01-Feb-19 10:27 PM] ca333#0118
hence why "CAN make a big dif..."

[01-Feb-19 10:28 PM] Strob#3417
the bug is still in version 0.3.3a?

[01-Feb-19 10:29 PM] ca333#0118
yes.

[01-Feb-19 10:31 PM] Decker#3767
seems it's platform specific ...

[01-Feb-19 10:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
```••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• zkSNARKs SuperNET```

[01-Feb-19 10:31 PM] Decker#3767
on Windows no any difference with `value` of passphrase field ... when it hidden or showed ...

[01-Feb-19 10:31 PM] zatJUM#9924
those chars?

[01-Feb-19 10:33 PM] Strob#3417
And did you check on Linux? I don't have any linux installed...

[01-Feb-19 10:33 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I understood what is the clue, but don't know yet how to use it

[01-Feb-19 10:33 PM] Decker#3767
@Strob ob no matter what the `*` sybols truncated ... value field (real data that passed to Agama) is unchanged.

[01-Feb-19 10:34 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
seed words should not be same??

[01-Feb-19 10:34 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Decker Did you try any number of "•" with your scripts?

does it apply to web wallet too?

[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] Decker#3767
i think this "bug" could be platform specific ...

[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Decker not "*", but "•"

[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] ca333#0118
its crazy actually that NO one came across this bug before

[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] ca333#0118
no its not @Decker

[01-Feb-19 10:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe because most of us use cli? :troll:

[01-Feb-19 10:38 PM] ca333#0118
time to test Agama!

[01-Feb-19 10:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pour que why?

[01-Feb-19 10:38 PM] ca333#0118
if the more techy ppl in here start using our software it could lead to significant improvement.

[01-Feb-19 10:39 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
seed words should not be same??

[01-Feb-19 10:39 PM] ca333#0118
i would appreciate this a lot

[01-Feb-19 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll make you a deal:
When the Readme actually builds when followed, I'll test it all you want

[01-Feb-19 10:51 PM] Gawain#7858
i like how fast someone grabbed the token 😃  trigger fingers were at the ready 😃 https://supernet.kmdexplorer.io/tx/f9af11d7b4336b27b8c22bf9ee38e3ce8066693f2533a4bdd16ccc1b90e2190c

[01-Feb-19 10:52 PM] Gawain#7858
yeah, i felt same yesterday haha

[01-Feb-19 10:53 PM] SHossain#0007
you should have revealed the solution after claiming all reward

[01-Feb-19 10:53 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 it's over now 😂

[01-Feb-19 10:54 PM] TonyL#3577
@Gawain I tried to paste different multiline options for a last 15 minutes or so so grabbed token on auto-pilot after you've revealed the seed

[01-Feb-19 10:54 PM] TonyL#3577

[01-Feb-19 10:54 PM] TonyL#3577

[01-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Pumtchak#0362
\n The "feature" was a bug 😆

[01-Feb-19 10:54 PM] Gawain#7858
nice haha. it was funny cause i guessed it right, and then i logged out to make a new address but forgot what method i guessed last, so took extra minute lmao

[01-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Kiruel#2091
i try this before almost 😒 428916753357428961916375842794183526563247189281569437645731298872694315139852674 jl777

[01-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Kiruel#2091
just \n ..

[01-Feb-19 10:55 PM] Kiruel#2091
so close

[01-Feb-19 10:55 PM] SHossain#0007
once you login into Agama Lite mode with 1 seed. you can activate any number of supported coins without enterring seed again (unless you logout)

[01-Feb-19 10:57 PM] Decker#3767
I think it's little bit unfair to use "multiline passphrase" with 0x0A symbols inside. But anyway puzzle was cool )

[01-Feb-19 10:58 PM] ca333#0118
NICE @Gawain

[01-Feb-19 10:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Really non-trivial puzzle

[01-Feb-19 10:58 PM] ca333#0118
this was easy - wasnt it!

[01-Feb-19 10:58 PM] ca333#0118
i told you guys. ok now i can tell @pbca26 to fix it.

[01-Feb-19 10:58 PM] ca333#0118
😃

[01-Feb-19 10:59 PM] Decker#3767
No ... it wasn't ... bcz passphrase shouldn't contain non-printable and control codes characters.

[01-Feb-19 10:59 PM] Decker#3767
But you just give me an idea for another puzzle ... )

[01-Feb-19 11:00 PM] ca333#0118
@pbca26 using reveal seed allows you to paste seeds with new lines. this leads to a diff. privatekey as if i pasted the same in hidden mode which would remove all new lines...
