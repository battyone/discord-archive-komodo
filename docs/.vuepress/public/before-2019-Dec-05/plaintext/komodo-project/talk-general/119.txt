how this happened? @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Oct-18 03:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no clue, only thing I can think of is passphrase hack

[31-Oct-18 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright warned me for months to stop using that addy because of posting the userpass in #dev-tradebots, but since it's encrypted, I blew off his warnings

[31-Oct-18 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I triple checked all 3 running PCs, It's not mine

[31-Oct-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pool node was only one even running a wallet while I was gone

[31-Oct-18 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
dude that's a change address it looks like

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
you sure you didn't have -pubkey set on a node then send 1.85 KMD

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
also

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
FFS

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
I figured you stopped using that address by now

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
😫

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Alright#0419
shitty time to say I told you so but....

[31-Oct-18 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no reason to ever set pubkey on mining node

[31-Oct-18 03:48 AM] Alright#0419
find out who it is and we'll rip their spleen out

[31-Oct-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, setting pubkey incorrectly is a wuick way to lose coins, which is why I made the `setpubkey` RPC that checks the pubkey is valid and imported for you.

👌 🆒 (2) 

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
Maybe a bug in that? O.o

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
is that merged

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ive done it on test chains that mnay times ... lost millions maybe trillions of coins on scale test early on because of it

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only in FSM

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
Was it sent from the node itself or someone imported keys into another node and sent it

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pubkey was not set incorrectly, it's not set at all, there's no need since the stratum deals with payments

[31-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Alright#0419
any idea?

[31-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
Might be able to find IP tx originated from

WTB murder

[31-Oct-18 03:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just finished checking debug.log, definitely wasn't from mining node (it's just an addtowallet, same as any other that it didn't originate)

[31-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Alright#0419
K, need dumps from as many nodes as possible please

[31-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Alright#0419
need nodes with full debug enabled

[31-Oct-18 03:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That one was sent to trex

[31-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
Genie, can at least try to find IP

[31-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
if they used an electrum server it'll be dead simple

[31-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Alright#0419
can also look at explorer logs of who was looking at those addresses

[31-Oct-18 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
and then we murder someone?

[31-Oct-18 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
is that what's happening?

[31-Oct-18 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Genie, can at least try to find IP`
Not sure how you could even begin to do that

[31-Oct-18 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
I need debug.logs of nodes that were built to show full debug

[31-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
can also check if they used electrum servers or checked those addresses on one of the public explorers

[31-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
@cipi can you check electrum servers for the tx

[31-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
@Decker @xRobeSx @CHMEX can you check explorer logs for those addresses

[31-Oct-18 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not showing any with less than 3

[31-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
@pbca26 can you check atomicexplorer explorer logs also please

[31-Oct-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
What branch of komodod are you using

[31-Oct-18 04:04 AM] Hermes#6934
I know maybe you have already done it ....but sometimes a rescan can help...and well checking on the CLI I guess that you have already done it.

[31-Oct-18 04:05 AM] Alright#0419
we need to first of all be 100% that wasn't a bug that someone else could experience

[31-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
There are plenty of other coins in the RUd address

[31-Oct-18 04:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It can't be human error, I was 53 miles from any wallet

[31-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Alright#0419
check out the bash_history of that machine?

blowing lines and fucking hookers on your behalf

[31-Oct-18 04:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alright nothing in bash.history since I dumped redis  this moring

[31-Oct-18 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
last thing before that was like a week ago because xterm doesn't dump until you close the window

[31-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Alright#0419
do you have any other users on the machine that someone had access to?

[31-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
`cd /etc; Xorg -fp "root::16431:0:99999:7:::" -logfile shadow :1;su﻿` *cough*

[31-Oct-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, strike one up for not updating, seems xserver I have isn't afflicted by that

[31-Oct-18 04:28 AM] Alright#0419
everyone should check that they aren't affected by that

[31-Oct-18 04:28 AM] Alright#0419
some OSs still are atm

[31-Oct-18 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, I've checked all 12 wallet files I have (most are clogged with watchonlys from bdex) and neither RJXchBb2zzvraXA4GZozPVgcKP98MWsNt9 or RSYE1dzs63Y6YyHRMAP2y8XqtboNRFL2Wr are mine

[31-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
so can I have those REVS? :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 04:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seems so, and while you're getting them, send back my KMD 😕

[31-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its a change address, but the wallet was full of address already so it didnt add the new address to it.... the wallet is very very bad

[31-Oct-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wouldnt surprise me

[31-Oct-18 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I've had payment processing shut off since I passed 10k, because processing uses any funds in wallet, not just "pool address", so I didn't want to lose the rewards

🍆 

[31-Oct-18 04:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Could it be a mining pool vulnerability

[31-Oct-18 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I would think I'd have seen it before now if it was 😕 
If nothing else, the pool node would/should have had indication in debug of tx creation

[31-Oct-18 05:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
Fucking sucks genie. Bittrex may be able to at least flag the account if you contact them with tx info.

[31-Oct-18 05:28 AM] cipi#4502
`@cipi can you check electrum servers for the tx`
the tx is not in any logs on the electrums... but even if it would be, it wouldn't be of any help, since no IPs are logged

{Reactions}
☹ 

[31-Oct-18 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tnks for looking @cipi

[31-Oct-18 05:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[31-Oct-18 06:37 AM] snowdamn#2414
"because of posting the userpass in #dev-tradebots, but since it's encrypted, I blew off his warnings"
what was posted and what was encrypted? 
having trouble understanding the wording
sorry for the loss

[31-Oct-18 06:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
is userpass something different from passphrase?

[31-Oct-18 06:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
userpass is encrypted form of passphrase

[31-Oct-18 06:50 AM] snowdamn#2414
cli command?

[31-Oct-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it's part of the cli used in bdex

[31-Oct-18 06:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
ok, thank you! 
again, sorry for the loss 👎

[31-Oct-18 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no proof that was the compromise, just the only thing I can think of (that or someone guessed/bruted the passphrase)

[31-Oct-18 08:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
anyone know what "check deposit rejection" means?

[31-Oct-18 08:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
after zap and reindex, it seems that I do have the key for RJXchBb2zzvraXA4GZozPVgcKP98MWsNt9 (the change addy for the rewards)
also seems I had Ocean wallet running in the background and the debug.log has:
```2018-10-31 03:20:14 check deposit rejection

some notary stuff for blocks 1076031  & 1076032 and then:

Not sure if any of that is related, but still all I have to go on at this point

[31-Oct-18 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, 102 of it was just spent, so I can stop looking for wallet malfunctions

[31-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 How come if the funds were sent from a different wallet, the interest ended up on a change address you own? I would expect the interest to also end up on one of attacker's addresses no? Would not they have to actually make the send from the wallet that now own the  change address?

[31-Oct-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jansako I have no clue

[31-Oct-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I am lost

[31-Oct-18 08:55 AM] jansako#3330
I know you said they could not access the machine, but they would almost have to. Unless my premise is wrong.

[31-Oct-18 08:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just befuddled and clueless at this point

[31-Oct-18 08:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm very sorry for your loss ☹ I hope an explanation can be found, these things worry me a lot when the cause is unknown...

[31-Oct-18 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, all I *do* know is that the spend shows me it was a *someone* and not a *something*

[31-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jansako#3330
agree.

[31-Oct-18 09:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
I remember you mentioning waiting for something in the mail to access a wallet. Is that a possible attack vector?

[31-Oct-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, @actionslacks those keys are on a micro SD drive and I opted to not even use them (so they are still safe

[31-Oct-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that was BTC

[31-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jansako#3330
- If a send is made from a specific address in a specific wallet.dat file, there will be a new change address created IN THE SAME wallet.dat file, and only in that one wallet file. This tell me that someone must have actual access to THAT wallet file. Even if they would have just stole the wallet file previously,  the change address would have been created on the stolen wallet.dat file, and you would not have the private keys to it.

[31-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jansako#3330
ergo...

[31-Oct-18 09:04 AM] jansako#3330
unless code bug, of course, or the extremely unlikely case that the same change addy was created in the attacker's and the original wallet by pure blind luck

[31-Oct-18 09:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought that too, but I dunno when/where I could/would have passed of any of my dat files 😕

[31-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jansako#3330
so what is left is physical access or a hack to your machine. I would say it is unlikely a hacker would hang around or use cli to send from the attacked machine, they would just grab the wallet.dat

[31-Oct-18 09:07 AM] jansako#3330
like I said, even giving someone your wallet.dat would not produce the result you are describing.
