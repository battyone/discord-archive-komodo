@ca333  Is the seed so easy that agma complains that the seed is too weak?

[27-Jan-19 01:49 PM] ch6ris#5240
hint #3? 😉

[27-Jan-19 01:52 PM] ca333#0118
@ch6ris - no, although easy to crack its not considered too weak according to state of the art bruteforce technologies.

agree - Decker is our Chuck Norris of Crypto. It will be cracked during the download process. In fact the download progress bar is also the "guess-the-seed" crack-progress bar.

[27-Jan-19 02:25 PM] ch6ris#5240
so he has no chin only another fist?

[27-Jan-19 02:30 PM] ca333#0118
not fist but another brain... he is a global IT genius with very deep understanding of technology. He breaks something down and wont leave it alone till he fully understands it (very ambitious). This is how i got to know him and how I would describe him. One day we will introduce all the masterminds behind Komodo and its ecoystem projects such as VRSC, KMDLABS, etc. one by one.

Another hint: It was mentioned in one of the last 3 tweets - alphanumerical with punctuation. You have to combine content of that said tweet.

[27-Jan-19 02:39 PM] ca333#0118
The first to guess which tweet we are talking about will trigger the next & pre-final hint.

[27-Jan-19 02:42 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker is always doing things at the background and has a lot of skills. I can't recall a time when he said he can't fix something that is needed.

[27-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Seko#7408
I think here is the seed: The screenshot above shows the current Agama release - i just loaded one easy to crack seed with 77.7 KMD. Download the wallet and try to guess the seed. First hint: The seed is mentioned in one of my recent tweets! #challenge #guesstheseed #Agama #KMD #Komodoplatform #crackme

Unfortunately, it wasn't the hashtags. That would have been easy

[27-Jan-19 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
that twitter link as seed generates this `RH3abUQzZhehLJc8fLKTgzVs2LiUb44P8c`
