but we dont know what we havent identified yet

[13-Jun-19 01:48 PM] phm87#7395
I guess that it requires too much work to change all wallets to avoid to use hacker funds based on utxo (in case an utxo is sent from hacker to normal users without tech knowledges). I discussed tainted coins with a bitcoin developer during BB and he told me that in his eyes, it is not a problem because it is possible to choose which utxo to spend (I agreed that it is possible but users without tech knowledges will have difficulties to do this)

[13-Jun-19 01:49 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User  I was thinking what if the hacker sends a small amount to each KMD address

[13-Jun-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i just want to get this behind us, not to create a potentially unsolvable never ending set of things to do

hacker selected KMD out of all the projects, to do this long term hack

[13-Jun-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and my guess is most all of the top 50 projects would be vulnerable

[13-Jun-19 01:51 PM] phm87#7395
some part of yiimp community is still following hacked XVG coins (from their wallet hack before 2017 and from the network attack in 2017/2018). Some complaints were done in US and such countries (I can complain for what I want in Belgium, police is forced to write any nonsense about crypto printing)

[13-Jun-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`he can make a script to do it every 10 minutes, ever changing txid`
I would bet on the ability to do it more than 200k times in a week

[13-Jun-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
maybe not the hacker's ability, but that it can be done

[13-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody get offers of cheap KMD?

[13-Jun-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
remember he spent months and months, patiently doing this. i think he just wants to collect 5% rewards for a while

[13-Jun-19 01:54 PM] phm87#7395
if it is the same attacker of the BTC js wallets (and XVG js wallets), he will move coins during months and dump them in years

[13-Jun-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810

yep, that's an oops by the hacker then... üòÑ

[13-Jun-19 01:59 PM] phm87#7395
As a similar exploit was performed on other cryptocurrencies (BTC, XVG, ...), I wonder if KMD will experience similar attacks as other cryptos had recently

[13-Jun-19 01:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
good for us :abusedsmily:

[13-Jun-19 02:00 PM] phm87#7395
@Deleted User  I won't bet on the hack of KMD community. I am not a bad guy

[13-Jun-19 02:00 PM] phm87#7395

processed refunds for today. up to 6 million refunded and almost 500 addresses

[13-Jun-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if you didnt get a refund yet, odds are you didnt send in the smartdust from old address to the address you claimed

[13-Jun-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i see over 100 in that state

[13-Jun-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if you did, then it seems there is an inconsistency with your claim so you need to get a hold of support to get things clarified

[13-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Digpri funds will be returned after the hard update? So already over 75% of funds returned?

[13-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That pretty good ratio tbh

[13-Jun-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, next week will deal with the stolen funds return

[13-Jun-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this week i want to take care of all the "standard" cases

[13-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Cool, thank you for your hard work!

[13-Jun-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
now the main flood of refunds is done. we can complete the update so exchanges can come back online, then to deal with the stolen funds cases and the other coins. i think for this week, we made very good progress and now we need to get the release out so exchanges can get back online

[13-Jun-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if you did not get a refund yet, dont fret

[13-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
contact support and get it clarified, odds are some little thing is not quite right

[13-Jun-19 04:53 PM] ribalinux#1248
When cases like mine that made a second application to update the address to receive funds can expect to be  refunded ?

[13-Jun-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it depends on the details. plz get confirmation from support if the claims data is consistent and also that you sent the smartdust from old address to new address

[13-Jun-19 04:56 PM] ribalinux#1248
yep i have send the dust

[13-Jun-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you procrastinated, you are in luck. i will be processing a few stragglers in about half hour. there is still time to send the smartdust from the old address to the new address. it could be the next batch of KMD refunds wont be until next tuesday.

[13-Jun-19 05:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@ribalinux you specified 2 different address as refund address for single compromised address. your claim is disputed. DM me with details to remove it from disputed list

[13-Jun-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain i already got ribalinux resolved, will be processing his refund shortly

[13-Jun-19 05:20 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. thanks

[13-Jun-19 06:06 PM] skerberus#7584
I only got my KMD so far, made smartdust payments for assets yesterday and did the claims some days ago

[13-Jun-19 06:07 PM] skerberus#7584
anyone from the team here to check my claim?

[13-Jun-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
non-KMD refunds will start being processed next week

[13-Jun-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
please understand the enormity and scope of work that we had to do in order to refund the vast majority of KMD already

[13-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
next we need to get the new version of komodod out so exchanges can reopen

[13-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we have to do that first, then we can move to the non-KMD chains

[13-Jun-19 06:13 PM] skerberus#7584
no problem and no need to hurry

[13-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is all exactly as i announced originally. if anything we are ahead of schedule in a lot of aspects and with assetchains, they are mostly not as time critical

[13-Jun-19 06:14 PM] skerberus#7584
I probably misunderstood

[13-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i want to return all the coins as soon as possible, but if to go too fast, the mistakes can be made

[13-Jun-19 06:15 PM] skerberus#7584
yeah I thought also ALL assets were returned, so that was just a misunderstanding

[13-Jun-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i did sent the smartdust to most of the non-KMD chains

from https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20CVC%20Guidance%20FINAL.pdf

5. Specific Business Models Involving CVC Transactions that May be
Exempt From the Definition of Money Transmission
5.1. CVC Trading Platforms and Decentralized Exchanges
CVC P2P trading platforms are websites that enable buyers and sellers of CVC to
find each other. Sometimes, trading platforms also facilitate trades as an intermediary. 
Under FinCEN regulations, a person is exempt from money transmitter status
if the person only provides the delivery, communication, or network access services
used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services.72 Consistent
with this exemption, if a CVC trading platform only provides a forum where buyers
and sellers of CVC post their bids and offers (with or without automatic matching of
counterparties), and the parties themselves settle any matched transactions through
an outside venue (either through individual wallets or other wallets not hosted by
the trading platform), the trading platform does not qualify as a money transmitter
under FinCEN regulations

[13-Jun-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
a fully decentralized atomicDEX fits very nicely into the 5.1 exemption, it appears that we can even make a website that displays info about the state of the DEX and that is ok too

6.9 million KMD has been refunded, we are down to the stragglers and the 150 who need to send the smartdust from the old address to the new address. maybe they are waiting until the weekend. 

for BTC, we need to use a different process as sending dust isnt very effective when the txfee will be so expensive. so we can do it in 2 ways, you can send funds from the old address to the new, doesnt matter how much or you can DM me a signed message (using QT wallet) with your old address and where the message is only the claim address. please send me your old address, new address and the signed message, along with the total

[13-Jun-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810

reading the release it looks like they have some sort of integration with the google cloud services and ETH, so you can spin up some oracles on google cloud services and pay ETH txfees
