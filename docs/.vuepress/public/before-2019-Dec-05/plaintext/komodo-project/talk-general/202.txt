No More Trading Or Listing Fees? Decred Releases New DEX Proposal
Exclusive: With so many cryptocurrency projects creating decentralized exchanges (DEXs) of their own, it’s reasonable to be skeptical about yet another. Today, cryptocurrency project Decred released official plans for its own Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

[04-Feb-19 10:34 PM] Decker#3767
The links connecting the numbers in the seed must be replaced by the number symbol of the first hint. - 6 links must be replaced with φ ... but on screen with φ - there is only **2** φ ... at start and in the end.

Maybe you should try with Golden rectangle numbers: F(n)*F(n+1), where F(n) = A000045(n) (Fibonacci numbers) or Joint-rank array of the numbers j*r^(i-1), where r = golden ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2, i>=1, j>=1, read by antidiagonals. in fact there a re many variants to the golden number 😉 https://oeis.org/search?q=golden+number&sort=&language=&go=Search

[05-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Hiya everyone! I had a quick question that I was hoping KMD developers could answer. Do all Komodo based projects (Hush, Pearl-Pay, Chainzilla, Pirate etc) support atomic swaps by default?

[05-Feb-19 10:48 AM] 0x03#8822
pirate doesn't because it's forced-z and afaik the marketmaker1 doesn't play ball with that.

[05-Feb-19 10:48 AM] 0x03#8822
but for the others, the answer should be `yes`

[05-Feb-19 12:24 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
Thanks for answering promptly @0x03  , reason for my question is as follows! 

I am involved with Resistance.io team , which is launching ResDEX decentralized exchange in coming months.. Short tldr;  ResDEX uses instant atomic swaps (within 30 sec trades) for decentralized trading (using RES as collateral) and zk-Snarks for Privacy.

[05-Feb-19 12:25 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
TOR routing is supported natively as well on ResDEX.  RES coin itself is CPU mineable (rewards split between Proof of Research, Proof of Work)  and anyone can check out working prototype through https://respool.io

Komodo platform is probably one of the most technologically-advanced projects in the cryptospace. It surprises me how often people overlook Komodo when there is a lot of mind-blowing stuff being developed by it’s team and even community members.

...

[05-Feb-19 12:27 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
What I would like to know is if it would be possibly to learn about which projects support swaps.

We would like to list popular KMD ecosystem projects (privacy centric is better) as we would like to be 'One stop exchange for all Privacy coins' . I can then get in touch with Resistance development team and get KMD projects on ResDEX.

[05-Feb-19 12:28 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
Would be happy to answer any questions or comments! : )

[05-Feb-19 12:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Wolf of RES this is the requirement for being listed on BarterDEX https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/add-coin-barterDEX.html

[05-Feb-19 12:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
almost any bitcoin-based coin can work

[05-Feb-19 12:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
is there a github or other way to follow Res development? I couldn't find anything from the website

[05-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
Yeah I know about BarterDEX! Thank you for sharing requirements! How is the liquidity and trading volume there these days on BarterDEX? 

ResDEX has some similarities actually with BarterDEX and we have decided to go with own Blockchain (based of ZCash fork) & integrated Proof of Research. 
Regarding RES development, you can get in touch with developers through our Discord https://discord.gg/QMZ22Wr . 
Github link isn't public at the moment but we will make it public most likely prior to exchange launch (which is scheduled for Q2 2019)

[05-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you can swap RES <> KMD, then swapping with all other assetchains shouldnt be too hard

{Reactions}
👌🏻 

[05-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which atomic swap protocol will you be using?

[05-Feb-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If under 30 secs is it blockchain to blockchain? Because wouldnt you be limited to each chains blocktime for the swaps to be confirmed?

[05-Feb-19 01:01 PM] crumb#2550
to me ResDEX seems like a DEX using proxy token

[05-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And welcome! You will find that everyone will be quite helpful around here 😃

[05-Feb-19 01:02 PM] crumb#2550
earlier he said that the swaps will go through RES token

[05-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha

[05-Feb-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That would still require RES<>kmd and RES<>BTC swaps to be confirmed on chain though?

[05-Feb-19 01:03 PM] crumb#2550
don't know the specifics. must ask @Wolf of RES

[05-Feb-19 01:05 PM] crumb#2550
what i don't understand is how they can describe ResDEX as instant atomic swaps and at the same time say transaction time max 30 seconds and RES token used as intermediary

[05-Feb-19 01:07 PM] crumb#2550
of course if RES is used as collateral (like KMD can be used in BarterDEX) then it would make more sense

[05-Feb-19 01:09 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
@Cryptoon  and @crumb  that is because ResDEX uses RES as collateral on exchange (locked during duration of trade) By locking RES as collateral, you can trade funds by skipping the block confirmations. 

So basically two types of swaps are possible: 
1) Simple one where you don't lock RES as collataral and that is dependent on independent blockchain confirmation times.
2) Instant where you lock RES and that happens in around 30 sec.

[05-Feb-19 01:09 PM] crumb#2550
so basically what i described above 😃 nice

[05-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
Yes @crumb  : ) Your explanation was on point!

[05-Feb-19 01:11 PM] crumb#2550
so to be clear: RES is not used as intermediary token at all?

[05-Feb-19 01:11 PM] crumb#2550
everything is pure atomic swaps?

[05-Feb-19 01:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Wolf of RES bartedex uses a similar method with komodo as collateral, 0conf swaps take only a couple seconds

[05-Feb-19 01:13 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
otherwise you can do normal swaps waiting for all confirmations

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
Resistance DEX has option for non-private & private-trade. For private trade, RES gets used as intermediary token (thereby providing the necessary privacy using snarks) ; else you can do normal swap.

For non private trades, RES doesn't get used as intermediary. Again similar to how @KomodoWorld  describes Barterdex.

[05-Feb-19 01:14 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
as for your question barterdex traffic is very low, there's an easier to use gui called hyperdex but, speaking as user, the hard part is matching utxo, strange errors and unstable connections. People skilled with cli have no problems though. All these issues should be fixed in v2 that is currently in testing. With v2 uxto will always match and uses the dht protocol of bittorrent, it will be easier for home users to provide liquidity

[05-Feb-19 01:16 PM] Wolf of RES#8148
I haven't given a look at Hyperdex myself. By the way while on subject of exchanges have you guys checked out DEX.AG recently that would work on price matching for all Ethereum based DEXs. It would be quite cool to implement something similar for non-ethereum based DEXs.

[05-Feb-19 01:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I read live stats, arbitrage bots, etc.. have all been long planned, but probably put on hold until v2
