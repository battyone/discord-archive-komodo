plus please keep in mind that many of the addresses that voted for him were compromized by the agama hack. so any revshares sent there will be automatically swept by the hacker.

It has come to my attention that my recent HUSH review omitted to mention the role VRSC played in that history. I am **mortified** that this may have caused offense. The VerusCoin review I hope to publish by Friday this week. The HUSH review will be edited subsequently to include VRSC's contributions and link to the full VerusCoin review. Thank you ‚òï

@dukeleto

[06-Aug-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
read those two and then calm down
only the affected txids are affected and they all existed from the early days, no txid created after that hardfork can be spent by the special address

[06-Aug-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
that is an incorrect characterization of it

[06-Aug-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it was the best that could be done in a messy situation, but all precautions were take to protect user funds. and as such significant amounts were unrecoverable and burned.

[06-Aug-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
a specific list of txids from the early days, that people had a chance to see if it was theirs. nobody ever claimed they had their funds moved

it is code in the VRSC daemon

[06-Aug-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
```This happened... Due to an error on the infrastructure side, all of the wallets that we mined to from funds we spent personally, the majority of what we mined, are gone. Really, truly, gone. One member of our team took it so hard that we started to worry about him, but before you get concerned, he‚Äôs ok. We considered what options we had to deal with this. Generally, we wanted this chain to be fair, pure, and to have absolute integrity. Everyone can make mistakes, and we will have updates as we improve, but we believed a fair coin could be launched thoughtfully, giving everyone equal opportunity, and in a way that could support its development through its growth in value over time.

If we do not have a way to recover our coins, we do not know how to sustain the realization of the Verus vision. Most of the coins we mined, we had planned to put towards future development. So, we have come up with a plan that we believe respects the fairness we intended in this launch, and enables us to move forward. We know how to recognize our lost transactions. We will make an update that will allow us to spend those and only those specific transactions to our development wallet, and we will roll out that update, move our transactions back into addresses that we control, preserve all other earnings and transactions, not modify the total supply, not change anything else, and put ourselves back in a position to carry the project forward. We will not touch any transactions that were not ours, meaning we spent our fiat funds to get by mining or staking along with you. We will not change the supply. We will not roll back and put your hard earned mining rewards at risk. We will identify and recover our transactions, no more. We have already done a post mortem, and I can assure you that an error like this will never happen again.
