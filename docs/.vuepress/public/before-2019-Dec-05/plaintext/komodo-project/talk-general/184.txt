`Hopefully they don't ban pepe`
unless they alter discord code, they can't

[26-Jan-19 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they might ban us for using it, though

This is the masternode one aswell:

Still not sure how it works... But it seems like masternodes implement checkpoints while normal nodes do not.

[27-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then they have exchanges pools and explorer connected only to masternodes... How they determine what is a masternode I think is the issue here for the most part.

[27-Jan-19 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you can imitate a masternode ... you can still attack.

[27-Jan-19 07:48 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
The have 3 masternodes layers that need either 20k or 10k pirl as collateral

me also protecting and you can see that as Im using a sheilded as my icon, no masternodes though 😃

[27-Jan-19 07:50 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the tweet means that other masternodes blockchains have implemented it, not that Pirl itself is protecting external blockchains

[27-Jan-19 07:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but I might get better maybe when I use hammer of Thor

He answered it's not limited to masternodes coins, the article says it's similar to horizen solution

@grewalsatinder big credit goes to @SHossain who has been monitoring all channels and felt/spotted the negative sentiment due to the missing emojis. He initiated the revolution.

@ca333 ERC20 within Agama! Fantastic.  2 questions: 1 is it easy to use (remember our interview last week?)  2. Can I mine VRSC from within the new wallet?

[27-Jan-19 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The seed is mentioned in one of my recent tweets!`
Which is great if you only tweet once a month :troll:

[27-Jan-19 12:29 PM] ca333#0118
1) it requires activation of a special mode @Crypto Rich - @SHossain our QA Chief and customer service expert will be happy to personally introduce you to the new Agama version. UX/UI is still the old one - however the system really works solid!

2) not yet but just a matter of time. Our Head of QA can also give you some insights into this topic @Crypto Rich
