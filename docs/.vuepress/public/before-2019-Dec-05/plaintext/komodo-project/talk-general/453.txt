```[ June3,2018at16:15– WhitePaper – Komodo Platform – version1.1]```Hi, is this the latest version of the White Paper?

[24-Nov-19 09:06 AM] CrisF#3405
@Bryan_Beus, do you know of a more recent version?

[24-Nov-19 09:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@CrisF 

The whitepaper is now the Core Technology Discussion on the developers.komodoplatform.com website

[24-Nov-19 09:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and I'm currently almost finished turning them into an interactive learning course

That's great, thanks!  Thanks for the great work, the docs and writing are quite awesome!

[24-Nov-19 09:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there a pdf version available somewhere, @Bryan_Beus?

I would like to measure interest in getting a fiat off ramp for komodo via Blockcard which is a VISA debit card.  If you spend over 750 USD/ month it would be free to use in credit card type purchasing.  I use the card  (currently available in US, but adding 150 other nations in the next six months), and it has been without issues.  They currently accept 13 cryptos for deposit and convert it to Ternio while you wait to make your purchases.  I wanted to see if komodo could be the 14th option for funding the card.

PIN Transaction Fee (Int’l) : $2.00
So each time I pay something there is a 2 usd fee for that?

[24-Nov-19 01:18 PM] hastrup#8742
I don't understand tern so you sell you btc to tern then tern is sold to fiat isn't it just selling btc whit extra steps?

[24-Nov-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
Anyone able to make a technical comparison between atomicdex and trustwallet?

[24-Nov-19 02:07 PM] Acura#2748
Trustwallet is no Dex

[24-Nov-19 02:13 PM] Markus#5464
@Acura any more arguments? i have a guy arguing that its better

[24-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Acura#2748
Thats my main argument

[24-Nov-19 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there needs to be more?

[24-Nov-19 02:26 PM] Acura#2748
^^

[24-Nov-19 02:31 PM] Markus#5464
the problem is that the user does not know the difference between a proxy dex and a real dex so they just assume its a dex more when its binance behind it so "it must be the real deal"

[24-Nov-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Trust Wallet provides self-hosted wallet services for Ethereum-based blockchains.`

where we can trade KMD, binance and coinex deposit/withdrawal closed

[24-Nov-19 02:39 PM] phm87#7395
deposit/withdrawal seems open on bittrex <https://global.bittrex.com/status> or you can use AtomicDEX

[24-Nov-19 02:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is there anything in komodod that detects I may have type ac_params wrongly and be on a different chain ?

[24-Nov-19 02:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
Compare the magic number

[24-Nov-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 that or "no", because you might want to make that change on purpose

[24-Nov-19 02:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
could deamon compare params to "those popular params" and suggest changes and ask for acceptance / yes / no

[24-Nov-19 02:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you might but good ui predicts such and give a tip, ask for comrifnation

[24-Nov-19 02:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if your action is probability < 0.01 it should ask confirmation

[24-Nov-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
daemons don't really have UIs

[24-Nov-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by design

[24-Nov-19 02:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
cli have command line ui

[24-Nov-19 02:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
can ask questions for confirmations / yes no

[24-Nov-19 02:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
That would be fun working at binance and confirming each trx

[24-Nov-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"cli" in crypto is a misnomer and is generally a single send/receive event

[24-Nov-19 02:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at minimum it should display warning that "your params are close to another popular coin params, ensure you are running it correctly" or sth

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Pirate kind of warns you

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`at minimum it should display warning`
then you would have to know every chain ever ran by everyone

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no of crouse not

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
only those popular

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and siaply warning whe you run sth that is not on the list of popular

[24-Nov-19 02:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not perfect, but minimizing problems 10-100x

[24-Nov-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`only those popular`
that's why copy/paste was invented
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.old>

[24-Nov-19 02:54 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
that could be param like -newbiecheck 🙂

[24-Nov-19 02:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
There wont be problems tbh 
You can sync the chain so you never see your coins so you can spent anything

[24-Nov-19 02:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
copy paste is great 🙂 it's just somtiems it produes errors too 🙂

> If you make something idiot-proof, someone will just make a better idiot.

[24-Nov-19 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not calling you an idiot, just pointing out that it's a never ending endeavor to attempt to solve things like that

[24-Nov-19 03:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
when you have reasonable goals it is not never ending; right goal for me e.g. is to eliminate some level (%) of errors/problems in a known context. Maybe in this context of wallet param it is already done - idk.

[24-Nov-19 03:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Is that possible to add "komodod -list_popular_params" ?

[24-Nov-19 03:18 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to list most popular params for example ?

[24-Nov-19 03:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or even simpler to ahve a built in table with params related to coin to just make "komodod -load_chain_params=ARRR"

[24-Nov-19 03:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
maybe it makes no sense for some reason, idk, but recently using cli and I had these thoughts it could simplify the usage for me

[24-Nov-19 03:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Is that possible to add "komodod -list_popular_params" ?`
yes
`./listassetchainparams`
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/listassetchainparams>
`or even simpler to ahve a built in table with params related to coin to just make "komodod -load_chain_params=ARRR"`
you could use the existing json and do that very simply with a very short script and what's already in the repo

[24-Nov-19 03:26 PM] NNoperator#3835
@CHMEX   ``PIN Transaction Fee (Int’l) : $2.00
So each time I pay something there is a 2 usd fee for that?``  No  as long as you use it without PIN then you don't have fees.   If you decide to travel to another country and use it to get cash back from a grocery clerk and enter your PIN to do so , then there would be that fee.  Assuming that Blockcard works in that country, which is likely a false assumption at the moment.

It seems a bit of a walled garden.  You can buy or sell, but you don't have the keys.

[26-Nov-19 07:33 AM] 0x03#8822
since i mentioned minipc.eu the other day as being a nice store, i do now also have some experience with their customer support. i can add that their support seems exceptional, they had multiple chances to prove it (sadly, but sometimes mass produced tech just stinks), and they suceeded at a 100% rate.

[26-Nov-19 07:34 AM] 0x03#8822
actually something one may recommend to others, since they accept kmd

[26-Nov-19 07:34 AM] 0x03#8822

[26-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
but at least it clears up a hell of a lot of "missing" funds

anyways back to komodo topic, how do we fully anonymise coming out

does that sound like a decent way to go about it, or am i missing some crucial steps

[26-Nov-19 10:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
not like im a terrorist funding isis or something 🙂  Don't think the government would go that deep into it, but just wanting to learn about privacy and staying anonymous if I so choose
