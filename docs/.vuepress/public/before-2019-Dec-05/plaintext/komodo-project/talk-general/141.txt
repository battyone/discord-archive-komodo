i don't speak officially for KMD. All I know, is web wallets are insecure and you should not use one except to test tiny transactions. It's best not to use it at all.

Agama in "Light Mode" means you don't have to download lots of stuff, you probably want to use that

[03-Dec-18 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
with web wallets, you are completely trusting all your money to many many third parties. The person who runs your internet, the people who control the domain name, evil hackers that can abuse basics of the internet to steal your money. There is no way to protect against it. Hence, web wallets are inherently insecure

[03-Dec-18 05:32 PM] sajjad#4095
Agma is going to download Zcash param keys ?

[03-Dec-18 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes. Agama does everything

The internet’s core infrastructure was hacked to steal ethereum ...
After logging in, a 10-second timer appeared, counting down to the wallet's funds being transferred out to the attacker.

every web wallet of every coin is susceptible to that attack. Which is why I tell newcomers to stay away from web wallets

just click on **Understand the risks** and the whole message is displayed there

[03-Dec-18 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you get used to a web wallet, you might never use anything else. One day, all your funds are gone

[03-Dec-18 05:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain i will go back into my code cave now 😃

[03-Dec-18 05:36 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah. i would never use a web wallet

[03-Dec-18 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
pbca26 created this one after some users wanting it

[03-Dec-18 05:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you make a new address via web wallet, that privkey could be compromised, even if you make no transactions via web wallet. Be careful, folks

[03-Dec-18 05:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain Hush has a web wallet for the same reason, people would not stop asking for it, even when devs explain how bad of an idea it is to use it for large amounts of funds

[03-Dec-18 05:38 PM] sajjad#4095
if I change my PC and install Agma again, can I access my wallet with my `seed` ?

[03-Dec-18 05:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@sajjad as long as you have your seedphrase, you can bring that to any computer in the world, log into Agama, and see all your funds

[03-Dec-18 05:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure you trust the computer, tho 😃

[03-Dec-18 05:39 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. and seed will only give you access to specific single address all time. if you use native mode, be sure to backup private keys of all addresses

[03-Dec-18 05:40 PM] sajjad#4095
how about lite mode, is it secure ?

[03-Dec-18 05:41 PM] SHossain#0007
if your computer is secure, then Lite mode is secure too. your private key never leaves your computer.

[03-Dec-18 05:41 PM] sajjad#4095
and if I change my computer ?

[03-Dec-18 05:41 PM] SHossain#0007
it uses Electrum servers to query data

[03-Dec-18 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
is the other computer secure?

[03-Dec-18 05:42 PM] sajjad#4095
yes

[03-Dec-18 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
then, it is same as the other computer

[03-Dec-18 05:42 PM] SHossain#0007
if your computer is secure, then Lite mode is secure too.

[03-Dec-18 05:42 PM] sajjad#4095
so just with seed I can login and access to my wallet. no matters where I install it

[03-Dec-18 05:43 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[03-Dec-18 05:43 PM] SHossain#0007

you can use same seed passphrase or WIF key there

Please someone should help me confirm if kmd will be experiencing hard fork this month.

[03-Dec-18 06:14 PM] SHossain#0007
There is a network upgrade happening on 15th December. Equivalent to a hardfork. But, there will not be any other chain, only mainchain.

[03-Dec-18 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
for most people, if the term "hard fork" scares you, just replace it with "mandatory upgrade". If you don't upgrade, your node will not be on the correct network

{Reactions}
👆🏽 💯 

[03-Dec-18 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
you won't lose your money, but it's a headache of fixing stuff, instead of upgrading before, and things going smoothly

[03-Dec-18 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is not anything like the BTC/BCH fork or other "contentious forks"

[03-Dec-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
when you change the "consensus rules" of a cryptocoin, all nodes must agree on the rules. If not, you get forks. So all KMD nodes must upgrade, so everyone is playing by the latest set of rules

[03-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Ogodomiya#2535
OK

[03-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Ogodomiya#2535

Seems that @Vertcoin was hit by a massive double-spend/re-org attack recently, 307 blocks + $100K USD in double spends! Largest $HUSH re-org attack ever was 45 blocks. Coins without $KMD #DPoW are not safe!

That re-org was deeper than coinbase maturity of 100 blocks. That is really really bad.

[03-Dec-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
good news is those coinbases could never be double spent! just one time were they valid

[03-Dec-18 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810

PoW is inherently concentrative. Why manufacture your own inferior security when you can just rely on Bitcoin's? Komodo checkpoints itself to BTC periodically, relying on BTC's superior security. This will become widespread as minor coins get nicehash'ed.
