What you are suggesting is sending the same transaction 30 times on Bitcoin, to be included in the exact same block, somehow makes that transaction more secure than a single transaction included in that block. 

The common denominator here is "included in a block" the number of transactions included in that block doesn't matter, it's the block that is secured and therefore the individual transactions in it.

[04-Apr-19 02:22 AM] crunchycat#0726
what's the "delay" increment of time?

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
in dpow

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what's the "delay" increment of time?`
1 KMD block

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
1 block?

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
no

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[04-Apr-19 02:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
it's 10m or something iirc from the whitepaper

[04-Apr-19 02:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s to btc

[04-Apr-19 02:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not kmd

[04-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
I really need to read the WP when I have a chance. @crunchycat do you know how the VBK chain is aware of what is and isn't on BTC? Must you run a full BTC node alongside the VBK node?

[04-Apr-19 02:24 AM] crunchycat#0726
so kmd only rolls back 1 KMD block if it detected an alternate chain?

[04-Apr-19 02:24 AM] Regnar#6164
I tried. @crunchycat if you want the answers to why more notarizations included in a block doesn't make it more secure, just read what I posted ^^^^^ I'm going to bed

[04-Apr-19 02:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do you know how the VBK chain is aware of what is and isn't on BTC?`
No, he doesn't; earlier he tried to claim that vbk was posting more txes in every btc block than a btc block can even hold

[04-Apr-19 02:25 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Alright I don't want to give inaccurate info so I'd say read the WP

[04-Apr-19 02:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
I read it

[04-Apr-19 02:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes, 30 txns from independent sources is more secure than 1

[04-Apr-19 02:26 AM] Draeth#3300
@crunchycat you do realize you are talking to ACTUAL developers who know what they are talking about right?

[04-Apr-19 02:27 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes, and I asked for a shill on KMD

[04-Apr-19 02:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we don't shill

[04-Apr-19 02:27 AM] Draeth#3300
@crunchycat and yet you are sitting here acting like you know more then they do

[04-Apr-19 02:27 AM] Draeth#3300
that is the dumbest thing ever

[04-Apr-19 02:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
you know what would benefit everyone.....why don't the actual devs here have a live chat with the VBK devs to discuss pros/cons of each approach?

[04-Apr-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
because they can say anything they want at this point and top it off with "trust us"

I'd honestly like to see a discussion between the two groups

[04-Apr-19 02:29 AM] Draeth#3300
didn't genie ask them a question to which they haven't replied?

[04-Apr-19 02:29 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay then, once they open source the code you'd be down for a chat with them in a forum where everyone could see?

[04-Apr-19 02:29 AM] Alright#0419

[04-Apr-19 02:30 AM] crunchycat#0726
well I'm sure they'll have other features not released yet for which they couldn't release code.  But code for everything that's in the wild now

[04-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Regnar#6164
@crunchycat ```A notarization is only a notarization if it is included in a block. Which means a block is what secures the notarization. The number of notarizations per block doesn't matter because if you were to compromise the security of the block itself (a 51% on Bitcoin, which we agree isn't likely) then it doesn't matter how many notarizations were included in that block, it's gone.

What you are suggesting is sending the same transaction 30 times on Bitcoin, to be included in the exact same block, somehow makes that transaction more secure than a single transaction included in that block. 

The common denominator here is "included in a block" the number of transactions included in that block doesn't matter, it's the block that is secured and therefore the individual transactions in it.``` ^^ read again. More TXs per block does not make it more secure. 

If PoP miners had came to consensus on what the hash actually is, and then sent a single tx to Bitcoin notarizing that hash, you'd have a better system.

@Regnar thank you for that, it makes sense

[04-Apr-19 02:31 AM] crunchycat#0726
So who would be the devs here that would be able to do a live chat, for all to see, with VBK devs?

[04-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
no one is making commitments, but they're free to come here and have a discussion

[04-Apr-19 02:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So who would be the devs here that would be able to do a live chat, for all to see, with VBK devs?`
at least a few might be around if it were to happen

[04-Apr-19 02:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
can you guys figure out who your reps would be?  And I'll see if VBK devs would be interested in something like this?

serious Q

[04-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Regnar#6164
tbh, I know you get mad we keep making closed source remarks but it's kinda hard to **talk** code if we can't **see** their code. It would just be talking about white paper theories

[04-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Alright#0419
from how I've seen their admins behave, I doubt they are the type of team that will hold a serious discussion

[04-Apr-19 02:36 AM] Regnar#6164
In reality what would this discussion entail? Komodo's code is visible for everyone to see, tear apart, try and find flaws, see if it does what we say it does... Closed source code means they can tell us it does something, but we can't really know.

[04-Apr-19 02:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
The discussion would be about pros/cons of each approach.  They are very different, and deserve an honest debate about each

[04-Apr-19 02:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The economics side is insane .  I wonder how many people are going to front their btc in a bull run

[04-Apr-19 02:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol, the economics of crypto in general are insane

[04-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Regnar#6164
Imagine if Satoshi just **SAID** they were creating a Peer to Peer decentralized digital currency that didn't rely on a single entity like the dozens before it, and didn't show any code until after he sold a couple million dollars worth. This is why it's so crazy to us @crunchycat

I get that.  I also get that they don't wanna expose code that could have vulnerabilities when the criticality is this great, until it's tested many times over.  So I see both sides

[04-Apr-19 02:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You had 3 years to find vulns

```I get that.  I also get that they don't wanna expose code that could have vulnerabilities when the criticality is this great, until it's tested many times over.  So I see both sides``` so expose the thousands of investors who just forked over their money (in an open source coin like Bitcoin) to a project that could have vulnerabilities?

[04-Apr-19 02:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
alright, I'll stop.  Will be back once it's open sourced since that's your primary concern

[04-Apr-19 02:41 AM] Regnar#6164
It's definitely primary for me, but isn't the ONLY concern

You ever argue with someone who listens to nothing you say, and only waits for you to finish so they can repeat the same idiotic things over and over again, as if they're decision to ignore facts somehow strengthens their arguments?

That's literally all I see here.   I am blocking people like this.  No time to convice those too immature to be open minded, or open to facts and reason.
