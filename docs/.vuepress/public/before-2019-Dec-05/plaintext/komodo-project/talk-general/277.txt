yea, I think there will still be room for a 0conf feature with the new MM2. I do wonder what the minimum amount of collateral would need to be, or if there would be a way to use ChannelsCC or GatewaysCC to speed up the trade execution process.

[21-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Regnar#6164
Either way, having an optional value add that uses KMD would be a nice positive for KMD hodlers, though not sure if that's in the works or the goal

[21-Apr-19 07:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
For anyone interested in voting for me, I'll update my github when I am back home but I will be dedicating at least 15% of my notary node mining rewards to support a bounty fund for KMD projects. This will be for dev costs/marketing initiatives /project improvement, etc. Initially this will be used to fund a gui dev for CHIPS, then other KMD projects will be able to apply for funds.
If anyone has requests for fund allocations, shoot me a message, I would love to hear your thoughts. 
As always, please consider me when voting for KMD notaries. Thank you!

Imaging a mobile app connected to blockchain, in the app u have things u should do, for example tasks or so and u need to have gps activated, once u complete those tasks or missions around the world u get rewarded with crypto

[21-Apr-19 02:54 PM] Regnar#6164
has anyone heard from @xRobeSx or Komodo Services?

[21-Apr-19 03:00 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Markus  I've been working on GPS + Oracles, and had some ideas for cryptocaching. Really needs extra components though, like timelocking / QR code / RFID / NFC on location to avoid abuse (GPS isn't hard to spoof). Location based faucet is on my to do list.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  Yea exactly, its not a easy thing to do but it could be very interesting if it would happen, considering how huge Pokemon Go was when it first started i can see something crypto related have same effect

[21-Apr-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
for strategic reasons

[21-Apr-19 03:03 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I figured as much.

[21-Apr-19 03:03 PM] Regnar#6164
Just was curious how many had no intention of voting, or left their coins on an exchange

[21-Apr-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's interesting data

[21-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Regnar#6164
glad about the small amount of exchange users, surprised about how many didn't plan to vote

[21-Apr-19 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
haven't heard from @xRobeSx for a very loooong time.

[21-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Regnar#6164

[21-Apr-19 03:05 PM] Regnar#6164
September last year was last message from him to me

[21-Apr-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
i've been trying to contact him for various network upgrade times with no luck

[21-Apr-19 03:06 PM] Regnar#6164
he was also running Komodo Services page too

[21-Apr-19 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
yep

[21-Apr-19 03:06 PM] Regnar#6164
just noticed that my APIs calling it stopped working so I figured I'd check up

[21-Apr-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
use Dexstats.info or kmdexplorer.io

[21-Apr-19 03:11 PM] Regnar#6164
API endpoints for kmdexplorer?

[21-Apr-19 03:12 PM] Regnar#6164
nvm ```https://kmdexplorer.io/insight-api-komodo/addrs/```

[21-Apr-19 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
remember kmdexplorer.io has a rate-limiter. 1 query per second. dexstats.info doesn't have limit iirc

[21-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Regnar#6164
I've constantly had trouble trying to find API endpoints for Komodo explorers lol

[21-Apr-19 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
bookmark them 😄

[21-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Regnar#6164
I tried using the Bitpay docs on github but they don't really help

[21-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Regnar#6164
haha I would! if I actually had them

[21-Apr-19 03:15 PM] Regnar#6164
also how would I remember kmdexplorer.io has rate limiter? lol I don't know anything about it's API 😛

[21-Apr-19 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
now you know it has rate-limiter 😃

[21-Apr-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007
not 100% sure if this is same with it's API though

[21-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Regnar#6164
is there any docs for dexstats API? so I can see what is available and how?

[21-Apr-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007

[21-Apr-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007

hence the "mid-election" bit 😛

[21-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a couple candidates in mind I want to see elected and I’m waiting to see who needs my (and my friends’) votes the most

[21-Apr-19 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I’m waiting to see who needs my (and my friends’) votes the most`
I think there's a fair bit of votes that fall into that category

[21-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362

last year it was exciting

[21-Apr-19 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
this year I feel there is a lot more people showing interest and dealing with nodes, I didn t even check last year stats because I was not in a very good situation :troll:

[21-Apr-19 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
and now we got LABS, people that also wanted to be prepared also acquired a ton of experience there

[21-Apr-19 09:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think the last 5 minutes of voting this year will be VERY interesting

[21-Apr-19 10:28 PM] PHBA2061#2530
is it possible to "dwy-attack" the richlist during these last 5 minutes so they can't cast their votes ? 😕

[21-Apr-19 11:59 PM] PTYX#6840
What's a dwy-attack

[22-Apr-19 12:00 AM] phm87#7395

[22-Apr-19 12:02 AM] phm87#7395
I won't (and can't) explain everything but basically you send small amounts in many transactions to an address. The receiver coin daemon won't be able to handle all incomming transactions

[22-Apr-19 12:03 AM] phm87#7395
I don't think that a dwy attack during few last minutes will affect the final results. Results will be in the blockchain whatever the time required to make the total per wallet

[22-Apr-19 12:08 AM] PTYX#6840
I noticed some dust sent to all addresses

[22-Apr-19 12:08 AM] PTYX#6840
Is that what that is?

[22-Apr-19 12:09 AM] phm87#7395
no they sent some dust to make the addresses appear on the lists of candidates

[22-Apr-19 12:10 AM] phm87#7395
lists such as this one https://dexstats.info/votelist.php#SH (not official)

[22-Apr-19 12:11 AM] PTYX#6840
It would be interesting to see if someone could clog up the chain in order to prevent voting. However, assuming the komodo team knew about the attack, they could extend voting time.

[22-Apr-19 12:12 AM] phm87#7395
well, if we could break dpow, we could make sth but unsure that it is worth to break dpow and use the exploit on the election

[22-Apr-19 12:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Another attack vector would be a ddos the richlists website so users can't see who is ahead. I'm not sure how long an attack like could disrupt voting.

[22-Apr-19 12:12 AM] PTYX#6840
You could break dpow momentarily, but not permanently

[22-Apr-19 12:14 AM] phm87#7395
an idea that someone wrote on the #notarynode  channel is to fill all blocks then no tx (or less tx) can make it into a block

[22-Apr-19 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders what the point of having private channels is_

[22-Apr-19 12:15 AM] phm87#7395
anyway, it is not worth it and it won't work

[22-Apr-19 01:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
DPoW doesn't really come into play in the NN election, since no exchanges are involved. Spam attacks don't care about DPoW nor does DPoW help against them.

[22-Apr-19 01:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
Spam attacks are not 51% attacks, although an attacker can do both at the same time to make things even worse

KMD is the main coin of the ecosystem and gains value as the ecosystem grows. <insert my prior explanations here>

You can use KMD to buy and sell items with, or use it to pay dPoW fees, or use it as an investment fund and claim the 5% rewards/month, the list goes on
