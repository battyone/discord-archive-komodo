@metaphilibert I find it exceptionally difficult knowing *exactly* what happened and seeing Komodo (both as a team and as a currency) "take the blame" for something that no one that was a part of Komodo in any official capacity even knew about. I find it  almost as difficult as to stomach someone forking Komodo, bastardizing the code, and blaming Komodo because they didn't understand the Komodo code. It's a shitshow, to be sure, and I like to keep the record straight, both for posterity and because blaming Komodo for what was done is like blaming Bitcoin for an earthquake on Mars.

[11-Jul-18 02:54 PM] hardcoree#7374
i was wondering how DPow is implemented and how it can secure the chain from 51% attack

[11-Jul-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the short answer is that it acts like "checkpoints" in traditional chains
notaries take an accepted hash from the chain, record it on a "higher chain" (KMD for assets and the like, BTC for KMD), and then record that hash from the higher chain back on to the originating chain

[11-Jul-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
since it happens frequently and notaries are able to block as a low difficulty, notaries don't have to "out hash" a chain in order to produce a block

[11-Jul-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the lag in getting the notarization done is less than the number of confirmations require, then it wont be possible to double spend against an exchange: https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json

[11-Jul-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt 100% protection against all possible 51% attacks, but is certainly much better than not having any notarizations at all. Think of it as "2FA for blockchain"

[11-Jul-18 03:10 PM] hardcoree#7374
cant the attacker also apply the dpow?

[11-Jul-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, because notary addresses are hard-coded into the protocol and as such only they are allowed (nodes will not accept "notary blocks" from non-notaries)

[11-Jul-18 03:13 PM] hardcoree#7374
how many nodes are there?

[11-Jul-18 03:13 PM] hardcoree#7374
and who controls the nodes?

[11-Jul-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
64 and they are voted into position by anyone holding KMD coins
1/2 of the nodes 1 year and the other 1/2 the next

caveat emptor

[11-Jul-18 03:21 PM] hardcoree#7374
so its in the hands of the nodes in the case of a 51% attack to roll back?

[11-Jul-18 03:22 PM] hardcoree#7374
is there a number a kmd that is required as collatoral for a node?

[11-Jul-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
There is no "roll back" because the attacker can't drop the chain back further than the last notarization

[11-Jul-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a "write protect" on the blockchain based on the notarization. only one chain can get notarized

[11-Jul-18 03:23 PM] hardcoree#7374
could you also elaborate on how the double spend be prevented?

you can only double spend if you can rewrite the chain that had your first spend

[11-Jul-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
by preventing the chain from being rewritten, the doublespend is prevented

[11-Jul-18 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant change the blockchain once its notarized, and if you cant change it that means you cant change it to spend a utxo differently

[11-Jul-18 03:39 PM] hardcoree#7374

[11-Jul-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
we decided against just selling notary spots. you need to be elected by the KMD holders and by and large we ended up with experienced server operators, most not having any large stake

[11-Jul-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the "collateral" is each operator's reputation and their chances in next year's election, the top half get automatically reelected and even if they arent the incumbents should win about half the spots

[11-Jul-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is strong incentive to do a good job, even if you are only motivated by money

[11-Jul-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are motivated by wanting to create a more secure KMD (as many notaries are), then the money is just a nice bonus

[11-Jul-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so by making the notaries a human element instead of just numbers, it gives us a qualitatively better group than some random number of masternodes (not that notary nodes are anything like masternodes)

[11-Jul-18 04:19 PM] hardcoree#7374
How much money is given ? And how does the voting process work ?

[11-Jul-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
voting is free. a special coin was airdropped for voting. people sent the VOTE coin to their candidate of choice

"...30 notary nodes are automatically re-elected as a result of exemplary service in the previous year. " How exactly does this work? Is it like the top 30 by uptime or some other metric?

[12-Jul-18 01:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Deleted User I think what he means to ask and assure himself of is that it's not like james or a handful of team members personally decide who the 30 are (based on likes, friendships, agreements, etc)

[12-Jul-18 01:24 AM] anonanon#1085
Exactly, ComputerGenie. I think of steem or at least eos as being like that, and I was hoping it might be different with KMD.

[12-Jul-18 01:38 AM] anonanon#1085
That makes sense. But then the other 30 that are exempt from votes, how does that part go? The dev team manually looks at the blockchain to see which nodes have the best track record of notarizations and then manually enters them into the code for the next fork?

[12-Jul-18 01:39 AM] anonanon#1085

[12-Jul-18 01:44 AM] anonanon#1085
so the top 30 performers there are added to the code on github by the devs along with the other 30 elected and 4 dev nodes. Then everybody forks on schedule and uses the updated list. And if there were shady business for whatever reason, it would be obvious because votes  and node stats are public.

[12-Jul-18 01:47 AM] anonanon#1085
That all makes sense. Cool, thanks.

[12-Jul-18 01:47 AM] anonanon#1085
Still got one more.

[12-Jul-18 01:48 AM] anonanon#1085
How does KMD deal with a $5 wrench situation where the government tracks down node operators and forces them to do its bidding? 64 is not prohibitively large for something like that imo. Does the 25% POW mining make a notary node attack much more difficult? How many dishonest nodes would someone need to perform the equivalent of a 51% attack?

[12-Jul-18 01:50 AM] anonanon#1085
Sure, I mean I know it seems pretty unlikely.

[12-Jul-18 01:51 AM] anonanon#1085
Wow, interesting. I noticed on the stats page that nodes were pretty evenly distributed around the world.

[12-Jul-18 01:56 AM] anonanon#1085
huh I see.

[12-Jul-18 02:05 AM] anonanon#1085
Ok, so nodes are elected/auto-chosen by their stats and distributed around the world. No lisk 'cartels', hard for governments to coordinate to take them all down. How about the number of dishonest nodes required to do something like the equivalent of a 51% attack?

[12-Jul-18 02:24 AM] anonanon#1085
As an aside, I want to mention that I wish there were not official Komodo documentation instructing me on how to enter a Ledger seed phrase into the Agama wallet. Even with the disclaimers, I feel like it is just super taboo and people won't like that. I'm sure you get 'How do I get the rewards on a Ledger?' question all day every day, but I personally think directing them to enter their seed is a mistake.

[12-Jul-18 02:29 AM] PTYX#6840

[12-Jul-18 02:39 AM] anonanon#1085
It's worth noting that the youtube comments under the tutorial are from people concerned about exposing the ledger seed. Anyway, I just think it looks bad.

[12-Jul-18 02:48 AM] PTYX#6840
We appreciate and understand your concern. The ledger integration is a priority and I am working on an Electrum fork with ledger capacity for Komodo. However, that will take time, development, and funds.

[12-Jul-18 02:49 AM] PTYX#6840
I think it's easy to point out the problems but much harder to device the solutions. Since ledger didn't want to play ball we do have to go the route Neo went.

We estimate to have working prototype in the next 2-3 monthsfor all chains but we did encounter some issues with the BTCP electrum fork. Once it's stable we will begin working on ledger which is already activated, but not tweaked for KMD yet.
