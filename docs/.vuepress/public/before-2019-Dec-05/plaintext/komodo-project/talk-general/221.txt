Chinese Bitcoin Miners Set to Activate One Million Mining Machines...
A Chinese miner named Xu Feng has recently stated that as the season starts turning in various Chinese provinces, up to one million mining machines may start mining bitcoin, a move that could see its hashrate move up.

Kroger expands ban on Visa credit cards to Smith's Food & Drug sto...
Kroger, which last year banned Visa cards in its Food Co. stores, is expanding its ban to Smith's Food & Drug Stores in seven states.

What is currently the coin with the highest tps? Ive been out of the game for a while.

If your asking about bandwidth, I don't think anyone can top Komodo. I think the team is still going to be doing another bandwidth test sometime in the future.

üéâ 

[02-Mar-19 02:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
the funny thing is, they could run the tps test, have it independently verified at 100k per sec or whatever, and the price wouldn't move a bit. Not only that, but all the naysayers would chime in ad hominem about "not truly decentralized" etc. Why does it have to be this way?

[02-Mar-19 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Because it doesn't pump their bags.

[02-Mar-19 03:26 PM] yorklab#7270
I think the issue here is that Komodo is still a little fish in a large pool. When they do have something of importance to convey there just isn't a lot of people listening. Many of the other projects getting attention like Tron, Stellar, etc., they partner with a big name company\project who is using, or at least trying their product. Once that happens everyone knows who they are and they get attention every time they sneeze.

[02-Mar-19 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Who here knows CryptoCoinTrader - He has a FB group with 100K plus users.

[02-Mar-19 03:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
just got back on fb, I'll check it out

[02-Mar-19 03:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Any positive feedback from them?  

They have approached ARRR about partnering for content, sponsorship and advertising.
I want to bring KMD in on this, but only if people think they are reputable. 

I myself am not on Facebook but they seem pretty active from the metrics FB reports.

[02-Mar-19 03:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I feel between ARRR and KMD they can have content and user engagement on many fronts... from investing in crypto, creating crypto and using crypto.

[02-Mar-19 03:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sprinkle in some Verus and asset chains for features and it seems like a solid way to break into a new market.  I am reaching out to @benohanlon but I am CERTAIN we will want positive feedback from the community before we proceed.

[02-Mar-19 04:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
Just signed up, seems pretty ok. shilling is discouraged, some decent banter.

[02-Mar-19 04:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Joe seems like a great guy.  Want's to make some vids on the projects, banner ads too.   It seems like "Not so much our style", but I like his position and alignment in the space.  
He can bring plenty of new eyes, good news reach, info sharing and quality content for both projects.

Can someone help me out here? I have an assetchain running, and i'm trying to send some of my assetchain coins back and forth for testing. However, i'm getting this error right now: Error: This transaction requires a transaction fee of at least 0.00005 because of its amount, complexity, or use of recently received funds!

[03-Mar-19 01:45 AM] Justaguy#6181
is the .00005 talking about a fee of KMD, or is the fee in my own asset chains coins?

[03-Mar-19 01:46 AM] ca333#0118
send a little bit less than you are trying to send - the 0.00005 are the TX fee that must be deducted from the send amount

[03-Mar-19 01:46 AM] Justaguy#6181
hm that makes sense, lemme try that

[03-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Justaguy#6181

one more thing, when I try to send fractions (like .8) I get a JSON error. Though, in the documentation, it seems to support decimals?

[03-Mar-19 01:51 AM] ca333#0118
`.8` - try `0.8` instead

[03-Mar-19 02:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can also sendtoaddress YOURADD AMOUNT "" "" true (it will deduct fees from amount)

[03-Mar-19 02:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
(And btw yes .X are not considered valid at least on sendmany)

[03-Mar-19 03:10 PM] wolfgang#3508
is it possible to launch a new token on kmd... reminiscent of erc20 on eth?

[03-Mar-19 03:12 PM] NNoperator#3835
@wolfgang  that is what we are all about.   Creating custom blockchains, and their resultant tokens.

[03-Mar-19 03:13 PM] wolfgang#3508
thats how I understood kmd

[03-Mar-19 03:14 PM] wolfgang#3508
is there a tutorial on how I go about doing so?

[03-Mar-19 03:15 PM] NNoperator#3835
I am sure there is.   Someone from the team can probably quickly point you in the right direction.

I think @jorian  has a point though ... having a seperate blockchain isnt always the best solution.

[03-Mar-19 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
depends what you need to do.

[03-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jorian#4555
can we already make a token on the KMD blockchain?

[03-Mar-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... only on an assetchain.. I would assime KMDCC chain wil ahve these possibilities

[03-Mar-19 03:23 PM] jorian#4555
oh right, i remember now

[03-Mar-19 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
adding cryptoconditions is a consensus-changing event, and the main KMD chain has not had cryptoconditions enabled on it, yet. It will first be thoroughly tested on other chains, such as KMDCC, HUSH/etc, and I expect that KMD will get CCs on mainnet when James thinks it's appropriate, and no sooner üòÖ

[03-Mar-19 03:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH will be migrating from having ZEC as our upstream to having KMD as our upstream. And we will be enabling a few CCs via -ac_ccenable, which allows you to selectively enable individual CCs. It's very exciting to be able to be one of the first chains to enable them

[03-Mar-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
labs enables them all üòÑ

[03-Mar-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but only import/export and oracle on the main chain

[03-Mar-19 04:41 PM] CryptoWhale#6115

Huobi got alot of fake volume

[03-Mar-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
would  not call it a active exchange

[03-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
or.... some big ETH holders is moving to KMD

[03-Mar-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
could some ETH whale now have 5% of KMD?

[03-Mar-19 04:58 PM] Markus#5464
question is was there really 5+ mil of kmd for sale?

[03-Mar-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
would have had to be a prearranged thing

[03-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
or it is just a totally random generating of trades to give many bitcoin to huobi for trading fees?

[03-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
whoever did that is leading the trading competition

[03-Mar-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i expected some extreme things when i saw that competition but didnt expect a large ETH <-> KMD swap

[03-Mar-19 05:00 PM] Markus#5464
But if its real then less then 50k kmd for someone having 5+ mil is barely noticeable

[03-Mar-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
1% is 1%

[03-Mar-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and as you say, maybe it was retraded many times so it could have been 500k KMD or less and then 50K KMD seems a lot bigger percentage

[03-Mar-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but we are all guessing

[03-Mar-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there was $10 mil volume against KRW the other week and there was no trading contest. these things they seem to be onetime events, so not part of any ongoing volume inflations
