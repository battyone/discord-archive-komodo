@PTYX @Dr Debt @siu - Chainmakers @jorian @sg777 @dukeleto and anyone else I missed... 

CryptoBridge is now able to list KMD asset chains.  
If you are looking for a new exchange focused on building their reputation that is easy to work with on the Developer side, they are a solid bet.  
Filling out the application on their site is the first step. 

Have a great day everyone!

If asset chains are about to go CryptoBridge, let they go together. Appereantly are listing fees 2.5 BTC or simething simmilar per single coin.

[07-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Blackbeard#9921
wow 2.5 BTC ?

[07-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Blackbeard#9921
It was like 0.5 BTC 6-8 months ago

[07-Feb-19 07:38 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
About a week ago was someone on a HUSH Discord talking about 2.5 BTC. I'll double check.

[07-Feb-19 07:41 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
Yes, it was @RunningMantheCoin , HUSH moderator.

[07-Feb-19 08:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Asset chain agents can discuss reduced listing fees on a per listing basis I am sure.  
They should have a simple time facilitating KMD coins now that the base code is in, so it should be doable.

[07-Feb-19 10:02 PM] RunningMantheCoin#7435
Unfortunately although very similar in many ways, HUSH is not an asset chain of KMD. You are correct that we had a discounted option of listing on Crypto Bridge but the community decided that the money was better spent on some other new exchanges for a fraction of the cost

[08-Feb-19 12:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[08-Feb-19 05:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The exchange has improved and brought on more people.  
2.5 btc is a lot for a non ICO project.  

If a number of KMD asset chains want to apply and then negotiate a group listing fee... I bet CB would be open to that. @halo kitty rules and others.

[08-Feb-19 09:40 AM] halo kitty rules#2280
@FishyGuts according to CryptoBridge official site ( https://crypto-bridge.org/coin-add/ ), listing fee is 3 BTC. That's too much. As BTCH is HUSH's punk I highly doubt HUSH community is willing to collect 0.5 BTC, let alone 2.5 or 3 BTC. The only possibility I see is a single donator, but this option is highly unlikely at the moment. @RunningMantheCoin , what do you think?

BTW: BTCH has development fund of 150k BTCH. That's significant % of circulating supply, but worthless at the current price.

[08-Feb-19 09:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Everything in life is negotiable.  
Start the process.  See what it takes for them to integrate an easy coin (since KMD is integrated for ARRR).  

Listing a KMD asset chain should be a walk in the park for an exchange that has KMD base code already.

[08-Feb-19 09:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I would not be surprised if you could easily get to half that fee or less.  With some discussion once they review the app.  

Best of luck whatever you decide.

Scavangerr bogy:
Ransomware, ‚ÄúCryptojacking,‚Äù and
‚Äú51% Attacks‚Äù
Along with the theft of crypto-assets, the
authors have observed multiple types of
cyber-attacks involving the blockchain
and crypto-assets including ransomware,
‚Äúcryptojacking,‚Äù and 51% attacks.
A long-standing security issue, ransomware
infects and encrypts a target system,
preventing its usage until a ransom,
typically paid in a cryptocurrency like
bitcoin, is paid by the victim.
A stealthier security risk is "cryptojacking" or deploying mining software
that silently utilizes a company‚Äôs system
processing power in the background, often
unbeknownst to the user.
A 51% attack occurs when a miner or group
of miners is able to amass a majority of
a blockchain‚Äôs hashing power, thereby
allowing the perpetrator to rearrange
transactions and ‚Äúdouble spend‚Äù coins.
Once a theoretical concept, this type of
attack has led to the theft of crypto-assets.
