@Mylo joke aside, does the "DEX" use their centralized gateway as well?

@goldenman jumblr still gets the revshare from DEX

[09-Mar-19 07:18 AM] goldenman#7301
@jl777c Thanks. Where can i read any details? How often share paid, or any example txID related this, etc. I could not find in whitepaper.

[09-Mar-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
only when it accumulates $1 mil or more is a payout made

[09-Mar-19 08:07 AM] coingirl87#6489
Is there a site where we can see DEX accumulation?

[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf has the KMD, https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1KRhTPvoxyJmVALwHFXZdeeWFbcJSbkFPu has the BTC, but really during the bear market mm1 usage has been pretty much for testing

[09-Mar-19 08:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Will DEX also benefit from mm2?

[09-Mar-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
of course

[09-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and with it so will JUMBLR, BOTS and MGW assets, which really become mini versions of DEX

[09-Mar-19 09:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jl777c  so the 0confim trading revstream is being deprecated in BOTS?

[09-Mar-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt a revstream, the deposits are 100% refundable

[09-Mar-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
people wouldnt look to kindly to have their deposits revshared out, would they?

[09-Mar-19 09:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I thought it had a 0.1% fee attached as well

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if that will be preserved in mm2, which doesnt support 0conf yet anyway

[09-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If someone forks off mm2 like for example CC will be doing for mobile dex integration, will DEX still get revenues?

[09-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is the dex revenue somehow hardcoded within or so?

[09-Mar-19 11:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be a stupid question, not even sure if that‚Äôs even possible

[09-Mar-19 11:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
If they dont change the address yes dex still gets the revs

[09-Mar-19 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought for notary system for example it would have been too hard to fork it because of how entangled kmd notaries are in everything

[09-Mar-19 11:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
The dex fee address is a hash in the code

[09-Mar-19 11:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Roger

[09-Mar-19 11:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
But than any other user using original mm2 will not be compatible with it....

[09-Mar-19 11:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
So it like they build their own dex hope that make sense

[09-Mar-19 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So a dex using mm2 with a different rev address will not be able to communicate with ‚Äòthe original‚Äô dex?

[09-Mar-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[09-Mar-19 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets say for example hyperdex, iirc they use mm1 and left the dex address as is, they just get a % of the revs, right?
Lets says they remove the dex address, then they would no longer be able to communicate with barterdex?

[09-Mar-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
correct

[09-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Meyse#0952
@Cryptoon CoinCollect won't change anything afaik, a part will still go to DEX

[09-Mar-19 01:21 PM] crumb#2550
different UI-s built on BarterDEX protocol share a percentage of revenue that they generate. i don't remember the exact percentage, but let's imagine it will be 10% of BarterDEX revenues. 

so if there are two UI-s Satinder's DEX (first BarterDEX) and HyperDEX. HyperDEX will become more popular and let's say its share of all transactions will be 85% and "Classic BarterDEX" will bring in 15% of revenue. Then HyperDEX will receive 8.5% and Classic BarterDEX 1.5% of BarterDEX total protocol revshares. 

in the future there will be undoubtedly more DEX-es using BarterDEX protocol and so the revshares will be divided amongst them, proportionally how much activity they'll have.

please correnct me @jl777c if i missed anything important

To add the secret source is the network-effects created upon Dex protocol , as more GUIs will want to join to get a share of the pool of volume while at the same time bringing their own users on the protocol so it more efficient to use Dex address and communicate than build your volume and market from scratch

[09-Mar-19 02:46 PM] mobipoi#5774
Compounding the effects is why binance is still a top exchange it volume keeps people there any top dev can make a binance but not the pull of volume
