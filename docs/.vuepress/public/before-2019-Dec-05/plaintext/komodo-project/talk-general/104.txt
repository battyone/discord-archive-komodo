[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and an notaisation happen

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
and after 3 confirms i accept payment and give you product

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then te TX is locked in

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
now then you make reorg and spend again

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
because no notarization happen after i pay you

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] forkwitch#6080
then i am lost?

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wont accept payment until notaisationhappens

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
never ever

[18-Oct-18 02:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on any chain

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and noone else with an brain would either

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
i see a new branch have the solution in it

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] Hermes#6934
@hypocalese  Keep me posted on the ticket on how it goes i will tell the dev team when they are back on the desk

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
dpowconfs commits

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
this must be in master

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cannot notaise every block... we had some sucess with every 3 , but the cost in KMD is too high

[18-Oct-18 02:51 AM] forkwitch#6080
yes ok i did not know the cost is high

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doing evey blocks is ridiculus with 1min block times

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just wait for a otarisation

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its 10mins

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
faster thab BTC

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
ok then all exchanges must use notarization hash info for deposit confirms

[18-Oct-18 02:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
NOT coin bc confirms

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They are in the pricess of implementing that and testing it right now

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] forkwitch#6080
please put the dpowconfs commits in the master

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The KMD deamon for KMD and all AC will report

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 confirm for 1 confrim

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but 2 confirms only after notarisation

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
backwards compatible with all exchnage

[18-Oct-18 02:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you canot do every block

[18-Oct-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it does not work

[18-Oct-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
reorgs happen

[18-Oct-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are natrual blockchin occurance

[18-Oct-18 02:54 AM] forkwitch#6080
i understand this point you are repeating

[18-Oct-18 02:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will break everyhting doing ht

[18-Oct-18 02:55 AM] forkwitch#6080
every here and there it has reorgs. this is normal. i did not know about high costs and high repeatings of the notarizations

[18-Oct-18 02:55 AM] forkwitch#6080
what is with the dpowconfs commits?

[18-Oct-18 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we tested every 3 and had sucess ... but there was no reason to go faster than 5... and 10 is probably fin too, as long as you wait for a notarisation.

[18-Oct-18 02:56 AM] forkwitch#6080
@blackjok3r do you know what the dpowconfs are?

[18-Oct-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really dont understand what your trying to prove ... you didnt reorg back past a notarisation so your attack failed.

[18-Oct-18 02:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop lieing on social media

[18-Oct-18 02:57 AM] forkwitch#6080
i made a 51% attack and changed a block. its clear definition of a 51 attack

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] forkwitch#6080
dpowconfs is the solution that is good

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] forkwitch#6080
i am not a social media liar

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
NO you didnt a 51% attack is adouble spend

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
chaingin a block happens all the time

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in normal mining

[18-Oct-18 02:58 AM] forkwitch#6080
double spend after notarization is not possible because you can not change blocks here

[18-Oct-18 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then make that clear

[18-Oct-18 02:59 AM] forkwitch#6080
you can double spend it in the time before the notarization happens

[18-Oct-18 02:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not if the person your trading with has any brain or sense

[18-Oct-18 03:00 AM] forkwitch#6080
i have not attacked the komodoplatform and i have the permission for the attack test

[18-Oct-18 03:00 AM] forkwitch#6080
in agreement i made no trial to doublespend because its not the goal

[18-Oct-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you wait for a notarisation üòï

[18-Oct-18 03:00 AM] forkwitch#6080
i believe the DPOW can be the solution for all low hash POW tokens

[18-Oct-18 03:01 AM] forkwitch#6080
when dpowconfs is the default setting!

[18-Oct-18 03:01 AM] forkwitch#6080
i love to do a test when its master

[18-Oct-18 03:02 AM] forkwitch#6080
yesterday i first put the hands on the dpow codes of supernet

[18-Oct-18 03:02 AM] forkwitch#6080
sooo muuucchhh to read for me

[18-Oct-18 03:03 AM] forkwitch#6080
i have to learn this technology and understand it

[18-Oct-18 03:03 AM] forkwitch#6080
now in this stage i am a beginner in the dpow

[18-Oct-18 03:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am advanced... I fixed many of its bugs, its very powerful

[18-Oct-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you use it

[18-Oct-18 03:07 AM] forkwitch#6080
on dpow how is the net comm stack kept clean from the attacks?

[18-Oct-18 03:07 AM] forkwitch#6080
@blackjok3r ?

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] forkwitch#6080
i understand the dpow application layer is interfereable majorily through the networking level

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] forkwitch#6080
and not onchain

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Iguana ignores all packets not signed by an offical key

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] forkwitch#6080
what is 'offical key'

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] Alecandro#1179
Has KMD ever considered trying to use LUXs web wallet service for POS?

[18-Oct-18 03:08 AM] forkwitch#6080
from who?

[18-Oct-18 03:09 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notary node keys

[18-Oct-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notary nodes each have a pubkey that is hardcoded inth the deamon ... each node holds hte private key to that pubkey

[18-Oct-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they sign each notarisation and packet of iguana with this key

[18-Oct-18 03:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to take control of notaries you would nned majority of those proivate keys

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which are held by each operator not any single entity

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] forkwitch#6080
if i sniffed one correct signed package and resent for interferation

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only the public keys are known

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] forkwitch#6080
will it make problems?

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] forkwitch#6080
forget this.. excuses. i am in the attack already

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] forkwitch#6080
in the mind

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would fail

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] forkwitch#6080
üòÑ

[18-Oct-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
becuase if you changed the packed the signing would be wrong

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
i will not change it

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
i understand cryptography and know why you SIGN something

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a hash as far as I know... not an expert in cryptography though, only what I observed in playing with stuff

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
i am expert in cryptography on the handside

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
such a coincidence

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
but if package is valid dpow application takes it

[18-Oct-18 03:11 AM] forkwitch#6080
maybe interesting for a test

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
where can i see the notary nodes?

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We have a testnet for such things

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
the nodes ip lists and such

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
?

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It would be not a good idea to testthese things on mainnet

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
please use testnet

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üôè

[18-Oct-18 03:12 AM] forkwitch#6080
yes of course please can you show me the testnet specs

[18-Oct-18 03:13 AM] forkwitch#6080
you have extra notary nodes in it?

[18-Oct-18 03:13 AM] forkwitch#6080
for me i must see the main net but i will not attack without permission from you
