lol - yeah here is the source:
<https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-06-18/maxine-waters-demands-facebook-stop-all-development-libra-crypto-project>

[19-Jun-19 05:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
as it says in the zh piece:
_Maxine's full statement is below. What is most surprising is that she is, don't shoot us, right._

[19-Jun-19 05:47 AM] LocoMB#8593
but, put that a bit further: seeing f***book and several dozen vicious and evil megacorps hang and strangle themselves on a failed blockchain would be quite beneficial for all things sound money

[19-Jun-19 05:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is like a bad movie, life is getting really weird now. once the "good" crypto is available, the demonization of private, permissionless protocols can be ratcheted up in earnest.

[19-Jun-19 05:48 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes, and that'll fall flat on its face

[19-Jun-19 05:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
for those with the brain cells left to see through it, yes.

[19-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Hermes#6934
the word convenience and third world country is going to make this Facebook currency boom

[19-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Hermes#6934
too many people unbanked

[19-Jun-19 05:50 AM] LocoMB#8593
for the others too because they will see their wallets destroyed by swarms of vicious black hats that mostly unsuccessfully tried to hack real blockchains

[19-Jun-19 05:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
I can not imagine how a syndicate like LIBRA can come up with something that is not full of holes-

[19-Jun-19 05:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
BOEING 737MAX anyone?

[19-Jun-19 05:52 AM] LocoMB#8593
TITANIC? Titanic should not have sailed in the first place, because several security risks were known, but Zuckerberg types of the day pushed to make it so anyway, and not only that, but they even tried to win a speed record in iceberg filled waters

[19-Jun-19 05:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
True, but I mean react.js was ok. If they got a printer and can roll back blocks at any hint of trouble it may be salvageable.

[19-Jun-19 05:54 AM] LocoMB#8593
then hackers will use exactly that as attack vector - make them do so many rollbacks that the whole thing devolves from a ledger into a gooey lump of polymerized mess

[19-Jun-19 05:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
I hope it gets torn to shreds personally. It's just hard to believe that they don't have some serious technical help in putting this thing together

[19-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Hermes#6934
there was a comment on Zerohedge saying

[19-Jun-19 05:57 AM] LocoMB#8593
_BOTH_ space shuttle calamities were direct fault of arrogant inept management pushing through launches against explicit warnings of engineers

[19-Jun-19 05:57 AM] Hermes#6934
everybody will hate it but at the end the Goyim will use it

[19-Jun-19 05:57 AM] LocoMB#8593
yeah I hope so too- and imo the very nature of this decentralized thing will make it impossible to build adequate tech

[19-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Hermes#6934
You have to wish well even to your enemies if...not you will never have competition to fight with and get better

[19-Jun-19 05:58 AM] LocoMB#8593
evil megacorp management always tries to put in a cheap cosmetic fix on fundamental tech issues - think 737MAX

[19-Jun-19 05:59 AM] LocoMB#8593
they will do this with LIBRA too, and it will crash and burn - I think 737MAX is perfect example for what will happen with LIBRA

[19-Jun-19 05:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
I mean look at the system visa uses now.  they get hacked so often it's a line item in their budget

[19-Jun-19 06:01 AM] LocoMB#8593
sure- but blockchains it will be harder to sweep under the rug, or even to fix it at all

[19-Jun-19 06:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
But the data must be harvested at any cost. I gotta read this whitepaper. I need a good laugh.  sitting at home eating dinner and hearing the virtues of crypto being extolled from the tv was just entirely surreal. Something big is coming in any case.

[19-Jun-19 06:06 AM] LocoMB#8593
I have to admit, I only scanned it for the juicy bits, like 'we are going to make it decentrlaized.. soon' but maybe reading up on the tech could be funny too

[19-Jun-19 06:07 AM] LocoMB#8593
here is another opinion form another zh article, sort of what I said above:
Which is Ms. Long‚Äôs conclusion in her recent article:
6. Facebook‚Äôs cryptocurrency will turn out, in the end, to be a Trojan horse that benefits Bitcoin.

[19-Jun-19 06:08 AM] LocoMB#8593
yay! surreal it is! üíà

[19-Jun-19 06:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
this is the beginning of a new era. and facebook is only the first one. many will follow. their shareholders will demand it.

`"When and if it comes, success will be driven not by funding rounds or idealogical zeal, but by users - casual, non-technophile users, who don't care about your manifesto, but just find your product handier than the alternatives."`

[19-Jun-19 02:33 PM] gcharang#6833
@Crabby Paddy this doc explains how to use the confs to see if a transaction is notarized: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPoW-conf.html
just keep querying the `"confirmations"` key of a transaction,
```
./komodo-cli getrawtransaction <txid> 1
```
 if  `"confirmations"` is greater than 1, the transaction is notarized
In KMD, a notarized transaction can't be reorged. So, it is safe to confirm the deposit to a user if `confirmations is >= 2`

[19-Jun-19 08:17 PM] willofleo#7505
although the above example is soo inconvenient as it forces you to use eth and pay gas on top of trading fees , although GUI is spot on UX is garbage only due to the exchange protocol I imagine mm2 will work nicely on that format. OTC it most likely the future of exchanges and will grow in users base with CEX style trading  as secondary  as most users are not traders , it more of a brokerage style relationship

[19-Jun-19 08:35 PM] willofleo#7505
Ok , Otc is what most people want , Few people actually actively trade most people just buy and hold for a very long while  , however the way CEX is designed by default  is made for traders , which it fine but for most non active traders that means having the token on exchanges with risk or hacking well but then there is the access to SAFU insurance which helps but owning ones privkey it important I can see why people may was a ledger compatible MM2 OTC online exchange with tradable private coin
