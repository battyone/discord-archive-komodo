it removed the last 2 things that can be used to trace a z transaction, which are what time the TX was sent, linking it to amount received in a transparent address.

@PTYX does adding partners using the KMD Platform help the value of the KMD coin itself? I‚Äôm see partnership after partnership but not changing the value of the coin...Heck, PPL (Populous) went up after partnering with Komodo

[01-Aug-18 05:03 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
good question cryptopeeps. My guess the profit does not have to be direct and instant. If you have new partnership you may have new tech users and new testers of technology. This may profit in the future, depends on partnership conditions.

What do these partnerships even mean, concrete?

[01-Aug-18 05:08 PM] Meyse#0952
I got no clue

[01-Aug-18 05:08 PM] PTYX#6840
It depends on the type of partnership and the terms of the deal. I don't pretend to know why the price has been steadily dropping.
