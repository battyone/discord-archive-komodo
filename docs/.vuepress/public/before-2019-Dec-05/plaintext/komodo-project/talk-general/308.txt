is someone in contact with changangel.io? Just saw an interview with the crypto mug investors, the exchange aims to give back to the dev teams of true decentralized blockchains

[21-May-19 01:33 PM] Lennart#9331
part of the exchange fees goes back to the project teams

[21-May-19 01:33 PM] Lennart#9331
i guess that would fit the spirit of Komodo very well

[21-May-19 01:34 PM] Lennart#9331

I am starting a tech startup. Anyone know some partnerships that we can list that don't require too much? We just started so it is hard to get true partners :(

[21-May-19 03:31 PM] Alexfrog#1338
use amazon web services, then claim youre partnered with amazon, clearly 😄 😄

[21-May-19 03:45 PM] rainbro7#4735

[21-May-19 04:12 PM] oldskool47#4778
Giving up on the project, but still wish you all the best. Cheers and Godspeed

[22-May-19 01:52 AM] K - i want more masternodes#3296
I'm trying to convince one of my favorite projects to use Komodo to prevent 51% attacks. 
Anyone know where I can find a list that summarises the benefits of using komodo? 
The team I'm trying to convince currently seems reluctant to move to komodo, but i think a list of strong benefits will help convince them.
The project is POS by the way.

From DP ann `We will create a hybrid token similar to Verus on the Komodo blockchain, you all know that we cannot adopt masternodes on KMD so we decided to go this way because users can stake their coins and get rewards or mine them (POS/POW), we still have to discuss percentages/block space/rewards and so on.`
DP will migrate to the KMD eco system
