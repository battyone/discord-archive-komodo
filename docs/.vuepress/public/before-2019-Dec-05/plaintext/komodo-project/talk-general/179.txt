Only a couple weeks left before the $ARRR goes full sapling only.
If you need help still, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE!
The migrate takes time, especially with a lot of funds.
Nearly 90% of has been migrated.

what is your guys opinion of ZEC?

[21-Jan-19 07:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Not private enough.  100% required private sends would work but they‚Äôre Years from that.  Pirate does that now though.  üëç

[21-Jan-19 07:33 PM] areweon#4259
but ZEC seems to have institutional interest, ie JP morgan with quorum

[21-Jan-19 07:33 PM] areweon#4259
and can be used as a currency for retail purchases while KMD isnt really for that

[21-Jan-19 07:34 PM] areweon#4259
so is smart to own KMD and ZEC? or just KMD?

[21-Jan-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
KMD is just as viable as a currency for retail purchases as ZEC

[21-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
if not more viable

[21-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Zec is a car without wheels. Kmd got those wheels and also got a nitro pack :p

[21-Jan-19 08:51 PM] SHossain#0007
i like nitro üòÉ

[21-Jan-19 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
But zec is a very beautiful car. Am not saying it is a bad coin at all. It s the opposite

[21-Jan-19 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`what is your guys opinion of ZEC?`
It's a great coin if you like making other people rich

[21-Jan-19 11:59 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

[22-Jan-19 12:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I like ZEC 
They are the original team working on making ZEC tech stronger

[22-Jan-19 12:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And KMD is adopting those as they are progressing

[22-Jan-19 12:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD also making new innovative solutions of its own

[22-Jan-19 12:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So I value both ZEC and KMD

[22-Jan-19 12:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Kinda equally

[22-Jan-19 09:54 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if well negotiated BitBay might even list KMD as basic trading pair
but there is a lot to think about - for exampel if it make sense at all - it is easy to make listing, but maybe people will not trade those tokens and they will get delisted in 6 months
so it's a part of bigger picture - promotind KMD platform solutions and tokens
not so small decision in general

[22-Jan-19 09:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I think might be good idea to list group of tokens for a discounted price on a cex that survived gov attack and is said to be Malta based now

[22-Jan-19 09:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
juust core team must think strategically in bigger picture if make sense now or later

[22-Jan-19 09:56 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and double check how is cex doing currently / not going to shut down next few months due to bear market üòÉ

Tipbots for KMD and ARRR still down for maintenance???

[22-Jan-19 04:39 PM] ph03nix#3115
they are both working

[22-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Alecandro#1179
So if I understand everything correctly, right now you can store KMD in ledger nano s and collect interest through the Magnum wallet? And Ledger is still working on updating Ledger live to be able to do that same?

[22-Jan-19 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alecandro read up couple of pages in #deleted-channel .

[22-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Alecandro#1179
thanks!

[22-Jan-19 05:41 PM] Privopunk#0447
Seeing the debate above, I always wonder if 100% private sends has to be a necessity ? Can't it be a choice between using it or not using it like Zcash does ? I might be missing a technical distinction I suppose since not 100% private send = traceable in some way.

[22-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Arboreal#3777
what does zcash exactly do?

[22-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Arboreal#3777
sorry for noob questions

[22-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Arboreal#3777
I am just learning

[22-Jan-19 05:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
z-cash takes free money off every miner

[22-Jan-19 05:52 PM] Arboreal#3777
yeah? never heard of that

[22-Jan-19 05:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
founders reward

[22-Jan-19 05:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
$77k per day or something

[22-Jan-19 05:53 PM] Arboreal#3777
is it a bad thing...?

[22-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Arboreal#3777
oh okay

[22-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Arboreal#3777
but I heard that zk-snarks that they use are very good tho

Interesting...  @Deleted User I keep confusing thenm with the phone burner appolication. Unless they are.. *gasps* the same?

[22-Jan-19 06:07 PM] Mink#9547
@Arboreal Yea i ask because zk seems wide-reaching. I do know about Pirate already they are really legit üí™

[22-Jan-19 06:08 PM] Arboreal#3777
I know there is an exchange built using zk-snarks

[22-Jan-19 06:08 PM] Arboreal#3777
I mentioned it here some time ago

[22-Jan-19 06:08 PM] Mink#9547
ah yea i know barterdex also using zk? or just supporting hush / kmd ?

[22-Jan-19 06:10 PM] Mink#9547
yep @Arboreal have followed ResDEX. Hopefully they are launching soon - sick platform for KMD projects to use as they are hardcore privacy too.

uses zk-snarks

[22-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Arboreal#3777
ya they probably will come out on top though. But it is a gut feeling

[22-Jan-19 06:12 PM] PTYX#6840
If the reward is disclosed to the community prior to launch, and it's transparently used for development, I can see how a founder's reward makes sense.

[22-Jan-19 06:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
zk-snarks are a tool.. who uses them best wil win

[22-Jan-19 06:12 PM] Mink#9547
yea it seems the applications are limitless with zk-snarks

[22-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Privopunk#0447
I wonder what Vitalik is doing with zk-Snarks on Ethereum. Haven't checked how it performed on Plasma cash in detail yet. Were they able to achieve higher thoroughput.

[22-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Privopunk#0447
In my opinion KMD has a faster growing ecosystem, though as others pointed out they do need liquidity. My friend convinced me about ARRR recently which got me looking more.

@Mink  true Coda's implementation would be sick as well. 
@Arboreal  thank you for link. Will check it out! I would also ask you to check Pirate Chain if you haven't already.
