so, in the future, the K64 conversation here can be abbreviated to "has GS tweeted yet?"

[11-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Mark81#4505
Is barbieri komodoworld?

[11-Sep-19 04:54 PM] LocoMB#8593
by the way- In wonder, if K64 is a Netherlands registered company, why is it GS Milano that is handling it?

[11-Sep-19 04:54 PM] LocoMB#8593
why not GS Amsterdam?

[11-Sep-19 04:55 PM] LocoMB#8593
and this is the address he visited:
Goldman Sachs International — Filiale Italiana
Via Santa Margherita, 14
20121 Milano
Italia

[11-Sep-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
amsterdam office was opened to focus on pension funds. but maybe they changed to become crypto VC

[11-Sep-19 04:57 PM] LocoMB#8593
@Deleted User  Milano, right, but also that office location?

[11-Sep-19 04:57 PM] gigamesh#3544
oh lol

[11-Sep-19 04:57 PM] LocoMB#8593
thats my point

[11-Sep-19 04:57 PM] LocoMB#8593
maybe you ask him next time

[11-Sep-19 04:58 PM] LocoMB#8593
bcs if he was at a different address- then GS Milano _should_ be aware that they have an extra office location there, right?!?!

[11-Sep-19 04:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, but did he do it?

[11-Sep-19 04:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
being able to does not mean that he checked it

[11-Sep-19 04:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
yes, prly better

[11-Sep-19 05:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
I was a bit sceptical when several ppl alleged that faking a few banlsters is not hard-
but then I remembered about all those rip-deals going on esp. in Italy

[11-Sep-19 05:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
this guy was not a moron either:

my point being: there are a _lot_ of very talented criminal business suit impersonators esp. in Milano and Venice

you actually insult every victim of every rip deal by avoiding this

[11-Sep-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody that is heavily invested in K64, this is not the same as GS confirmation

[11-Sep-19 05:02 PM] LocoMB#8593
yep... it is a bit redundant but I wanted to point out this criminal epdidemic in northern Italy

[11-Sep-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
he was accusing komodo team of criminal conspiracy, it didnt sound very objective

There are some sophisticated grifters out there.   Some historical examples : George Psalmanazar,  George C Parker and Gregor Macgregor

[11-Sep-19 05:09 PM] PTYX#6840
Why are we still discussing k64 on the general Komodo channel? What they do and who they do it to is between them. Komodo already made its position clear as well as some of the k64 partners. It just seems redundant.

[11-Sep-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, until Goldman Sachs publicly announces their K64 investment, there is no need to discuss it here

[11-Sep-19 05:11 PM] PTYX#6840
Exactly

i think we all agree that we just wait for GS confirmation, until then it is an unconfirmed transaction

Closed debate. ^

untill the public facts are there its hard to make any reasonable conclusion.

as sir jl also points out

[11-Sep-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
alternatively get the dozen blockchain devs that i was told would be hired and i can start training them. that is a non-GS way to confirm there is at least some funding

@Deleted User, nothing to make than shilling k64? KomodoWorld is dodgy, he was not in the real goldman office adress from Via Santa Margherita, 14. If he was genuinely, he can never ever talk about it, use your loaf.... he only heavy investered in k64... and abused trust from community... shillers..

GS has over 60 locations that they consider to be their "real office", @rikkert; they get to decide that, not you

[11-Sep-19 06:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
I personally can't see why Goldman Sachs has any interest in anything decentralized. IP is likely what they would be after. Which would involve their privatization of the donation of time, money, and effort by everyone involved with this ecosystem.

[11-Sep-19 06:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
"This just in, k64 to begin sending out FATF compliance forms to all holders after GS investment announcement"

[11-Sep-19 06:20 PM] rikkert#6335
the adress i write in the statement, is a real office of goldman, but KomodoWorld was in a other location, learn to read shillers, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 .

[11-Sep-19 06:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'm not against money, don't get me wrong. If that shit got announced and verified publicly that would be amazing for everyone here.

[11-Sep-19 06:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`he was not in the real goldman office...was in a other location, learn to read...`
I did learn to read, you said
`the real goldman office`
according to GS, those 60+ locations **are** their "real" offices
Now you *might* be able to argue that it's not their "headquarters", but if you were to go that route then you'd just be making a moot point instead of wrong one

[11-Sep-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i think he is saying that the office that was visited was not in the list of any of the 60 official locations
