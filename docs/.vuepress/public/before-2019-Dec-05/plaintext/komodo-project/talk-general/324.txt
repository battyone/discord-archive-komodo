[05-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Catalyst#8405
when i try to open the komodoOcean GUI

[05-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Catalyst#8405
it gives this error saying

[05-Jun-19 05:58 PM] lluisin#7655
Are seeds for other coins/wallets used in the same computer than agama compromised?

[05-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Catalyst#8405
Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=vlaue syntax

[05-Jun-19 05:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
@lluisin if you imported those seeds in agama yes

[05-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Catalyst#8405
what am i doing wrong? the folder in the app data is empty

[05-Jun-19 06:00 PM] lluisin#7655
@mrlynch    no, but for example i used the Ardor seed in the same computer than agama while agama was running

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Alecandro#1179
Do we have any confirmation that Digital price was hacked as well?

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Alecandro#1179
or is someone spreading fud

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Catalyst komodo ocean uses native mode iirc... try verus agama for lite mode

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
@lluisin as long as you haven't imported that in agama you're ok

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] lluisin#7655
ok thanks

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Alecandro there's a post in their announcements channel.. i'm afraid they've been done

[05-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Catalyst#8405
But i want to have with me the native mode now. The agama word gives me the scare now

[05-Jun-19 06:02 PM] SpraY#9508
quite the nasty situation we got...

[05-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Catalyst#8405
how to fix it @mrlynch

[05-Jun-19 06:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Catalyst you need to create a .conf file in appdata folder 
create a file called `komodo.conf` in %AppData%\Komodo\ with the following content
```rpcuser=usernameChangeItToSomethingSecure
rpcpassword=passwordChangeItToSomethingSecure
txindex=1
daemon=1
bind=127.0.0.1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241
addnode=144.76.94.38```

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Catalyst#8405
noice

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Catalyst#8405
thanks

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
before you start komodo ocean you will want to bootstrap kmd

[05-Jun-19 06:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
otherwise it will take a few hours to sync the whole chain in native

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
<https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz>
extract this in %AppData%\Komodo

[05-Jun-19 06:06 PM] neo1947#9077
can l use my old agama wallet seeds to recover my wallet on   Veruscoin agama?

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
@neo1947 you need to transfer your funds to a new address

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] gcharang#6833
yes @neo1947  but move them out of there to a new wallet created on Verus agama

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] 50MHz#3277
How about using a ledger address for the new address, not for mining, but for the recovery?

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
importing old wallet seed is only so that you move the funds

[05-Jun-19 06:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
@50MHz that is a great idea

[05-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Catalyst#8405
@mrlynch  i have downloaded the file but do i have to extract the file to appdata or just copy paste it there?

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
you have to extract it to the folder where u placed komodo.conf

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Catalyst#8405
cool

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
the file you downloaded is an archive of blocks and chainstate

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
you might need 7zip to extract from a .tar.gz archive on windows though

[05-Jun-19 06:13 PM] lwkl72#7664
I think kmd frozen now for very long time on dp...

[05-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Catalyst#8405
oh that's why i got confused. i use Win RaR

[05-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Magnum Wallet#0608
With reference to the recent issues with Agama, we want to remind you that you can use Komodo in the Magnum Wallet, where the vulnerability had not been detected. For added security, you can manage your KMD with the Ledger Nano S/X devices. Remember that you can also claim rewards in Magnum.  And what's more, our Telegram notifier bot will keep you posted on all transactions. If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer them.

Hey folks. I downloaded the Ocean QT wallet in an effort to secure my funds, but I'm recieving the error: "Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and restart" 

I don't see either of those files in the Ocean QT folder. Am I missing something?

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@Patziggy which OS?

[05-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Patziggy#9371
Windows

@Magnum Wallet Do you have any plan on implementing Komodo assets (ie: ZEXO/OURC/KMDICE/Chips... etc) on Magnum Wallet?

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Smedley#8094
Whats stopping people from claiming funds that aren't theirs?

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Patziggy#9371
Ahh, I'm on Windows 7, that would likely be the issue given the system requirements. I did create a new address as per one of the team members recommendations using this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029929-creating-a-new-address-via-command-line-interface-cli-in-windows

Would it be possible to transfer funds to another wallet implimentation other than OceanQT using this new address?

[05-Jun-19 06:18 PM] gcharang#6833
were you using native mode before?

[05-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Patziggy#9371
For the Agama wallet? I'm uncertain. I haven't opened it to check my funds since the vulnerability announcement.

[05-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Patziggy#9371
I'm tempted to log in and quickly transfer them to a hardware wallet if possible

[05-Jun-19 06:20 PM] Patziggy#9371
I believe I used Lite Mode primarily

[05-Jun-19 06:26 PM] psalm#0481
So my coins weren‚Äôt taken out of agama why can‚Äôt I send them to binance?

[05-Jun-19 06:28 PM] gcharang#6833
@psalm binance deposits/withdraw are frozen

[05-Jun-19 06:29 PM] psalm#0481
Thanks I just need to be able to send them out of agama I know it‚Äôs compromised

[05-Jun-19 06:30 PM] gcharang#6833
@Patziggy then you can follow my advise in community support (the last pinned post)

[05-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Magnum Wallet#0608
@VET5#3137 Thanks for your question. At this moment we don't have plans to integrate those assets. Now we are working on some other features like nano X Bluetooth integration, mnemonics support, etc. But at the same time if there is an interest from the community we are opened for these integrations.

[05-Jun-19 06:31 PM] Patziggy#9371
Got it, thank you @gcharang. Would you recommend the sha256 version, or the non-sha256? I'm unsure of the difference

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] gcharang#6833
sha256 iguana --  more secure

guys one more thing i would like to ask.. I have a 1TB external HDD. Is is possible that when i connect the external hDD and run  Komodoocean gui from my laptop. Is it possible to make it fetches the data from ex HDD not the internal hdd of me laptop. is it possible?

[05-Jun-19 06:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Slahi those seem to be change addresses and were swept to safety

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Slahi#1785
@mrlynch  many thx for explanation.

[05-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@Catalyst not in an easy way probably, because it was coded to load from komodo folder

[05-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Catalyst#8405
damn .. I had 20 GB on laptop and it filled but and still almost 67% done :/

[05-Jun-19 06:48 PM] neo1947#9077
seems that Binance and bittrex still disabled

[05-Jun-19 06:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Catalyst if you were using lite mode, please give up native right now andd secure the funds first using the Verus lite mode

@gcharang I have my private key recorded, but don't have the actual address written down. Would resoring the wallet in the Verus Agama wallet without checking the account first pose any issue?

no issue @Patziggy

@Deleted User Understood. I plan to reinstate the wallet using Verus' Agama wallet, then migrate the KMD to the new address that was created using the Verus wallet, assuming the KMD is not included in the 8 million that were secured by the team.

How do I look up my Supernet assets on blockchain, my wallet I can see was emptied, didn't have a lot of Supernet, 4.5, but want to see if I need to file a claim for that, and 1 REVs while I am at it.

[05-Jun-19 07:10 PM] agnewpickens#7393
I already filed the claim for the missing KMD.

[05-Jun-19 07:11 PM] agnewpickens#7393
1 REVs probably not worth much, but I would like to check my Supernet.
