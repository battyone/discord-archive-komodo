Oh it allows for SVP

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Geocold51#6462
SPV*

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not for pirate

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Geocold51#6462
oh üò¶

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Geocold51#6462
I'm not seeing pirate in the options

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Geocold51#6462
Oh nvm

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Click activate coin,  it's in the list

[14-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Geocold51#6462
it's not called ARRR

[14-Oct-18 04:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yea, that's just the ticket

[14-Oct-18 04:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ticker

[14-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Alright#0419
PIRATE should be the ticker

[14-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Geocold51#6462
Got it

[14-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Alright#0419
3-4 character ticker standard is stupid

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just wait til the masses start demanding it start with X to fit currency code standard

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Geocold51#6462
OH shit

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Geocold51#6462
is that why

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Geocold51#6462
they call it

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Geocold51#6462
XTB?

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Alright#0419
If I negotiated a deal to get STAKED listed and they say 6 char ticker won't work, I will turn them down

[14-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Geocold51#6462
I never put the two togheter

[14-Oct-18 04:50 AM] Geocold51#6462
Negotiating with who?

[14-Oct-18 04:50 AM] Alright#0419
CEXs

[14-Oct-18 04:50 AM] Alright#0419
STAKED is a KMD asset chain

no it's not üòâ

[14-Oct-18 04:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You need to make a z address @Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 04:55 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getnewaddress`

[14-Oct-18 04:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The default transparent won't work on this chain @Geocold51

[14-Oct-18 04:55 AM] Alright#0419
don't post it publicly btw

[14-Oct-18 04:55 AM] Alright#0419
pm it to him

[14-Oct-18 04:55 AM] Geocold51#6462
ok

[14-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
Wait

[14-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Geocold51#6462

[14-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
Ya

[14-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Geocold51#6462
I did and it gave me that

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Click get new address

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
Ohh

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
z address

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
i'm dum

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Geocold51#6462
gotcha

[14-Oct-18 04:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The T addr can only be used when mining to receive new coins

[14-Oct-18 04:58 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Then any transactions have to be to a zaddr

[14-Oct-18 04:59 AM] Geocold51#6462
Gotcha

[14-Oct-18 05:23 AM] TheBitcoins#8823
who is a good youtuber to watch to help me get caught up on komodo?

[14-Oct-18 06:57 AM] jspook16#3059
Bitcoin Benny @Bitcoin Benny   he can point you to other resources too probably

[14-Oct-18 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Cryptorich has done several vids on the subject as well

[14-Oct-18 07:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And @benohanlon has done several really good interviews with various parties

[14-Oct-18 08:41 AM] eaglecelest#6096
Hi,

[14-Oct-18 08:42 AM] eaglecelest#6096
what is the best coin to mine in equihash right now?

[14-Oct-18 08:55 AM] And1_89#6578
Pirate

[14-Oct-18 08:58 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@polycryptoblog  what happens if user assumes the Arrr t-address is good and will transfer Arrr to it from z ? it vanishes?

[14-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
tx is rejected

[14-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Alright#0419
consensus rules don't allow it

[14-Oct-18 09:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So once it goes to z you cant go back to t?

[14-Oct-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
pirate? yes. you can't send tx from z to t

[14-Oct-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless that t address is a Notary Node address.

[14-Oct-18 09:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's the condition

[14-Oct-18 09:40 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think i'm going crazy, is someone able to tell me how I find what my wallet.dat pubkey is, using cli?

[14-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
validateaddress

[14-Oct-18 09:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm getting ```{
  "isvalid": false
}```
But when I `z_gettotalbalance` or `getbalance`, it is showing coins?

[14-Oct-18 09:45 AM] TonyL#3577
For z-addresses I guess `z_listaddresses` will show you z-addresses related to your wallet.dat

[14-Oct-18 09:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I have my zaddr, just not my taddr üò¶

@NutellaLicka for PIRATE, unless you solo-mined, your t_addy is meaningless and empty

[14-Oct-18 09:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's actually for a test chain I made. Couldn't for the life of me find my address, `getaccountaddress` was too obvious üò≥

Dpos is flawed allowing cartels to take control I got tired of that.

[14-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
guys Im in the talks in Telegram with btcp about them using DPOW from komodo's

[14-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it can be done right?

[14-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
after what happen yesterday its a good way to marketing  them about the DPOW

[14-Oct-18 03:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
great that sounds like it becomes a KMD eco system coin
I believe duke and james implemented a protection system before for them

[14-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ahh so it was discussed already

[14-Oct-18 03:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
no that was something else:

[14-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
300 kmd?

[14-Oct-18 03:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes 300 KMD and 300 BTCP
and the implementation on the core at btcp

[14-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Buddz1993#5380
cool stuff

[14-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if one of the devs come here into the discord to talk about this which channel should they be sent to?
