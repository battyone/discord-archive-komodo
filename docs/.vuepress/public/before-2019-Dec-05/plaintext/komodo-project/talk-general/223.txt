"Stu:
komodo just took bitcoins code base and tweaked it to make a quick altcoin

inconvenient truth: komodo atomic swaps existed on bitcoin before komodo"

"Stu:
komodo is 10 years will be a footnote"

He thinks komodo is just a simple altcoin that took advantage of anon hype and was marketed heavily. Delusional!

[03-Mar-19 09:20 PM] Alright#0419
They're 3 main products have a lot of inspiration from Komodo tech IMO.
 Clove(barterdex), flora(cryptoconditions), saffron(assetchains)
They're a direct competitor. They're not likely to say anything good about KMD.

[03-Mar-19 09:21 PM] rainbro7#4735
Yeah but to explain komodo as a simple fork and to say that our Dev community is lazy/non existent seems to be a great injustice

[03-Mar-19 09:21 PM] Alright#0419
`komodo atomic swaps existed on bitcoin before komodo`
CLTV swaps existed prior to Komodo, but jl777 has been involved in atomic swaps since basically they're inception. He was the first to create decentralized order matching for them as far as I'm aware

[03-Mar-19 09:22 PM] Alright#0419
They've obviously never been here if they think our dev community is non-existent

[03-Mar-19 09:23 PM] rainbro7#4735
From my understanding the swap mechanism  had issues before that komodo solved. Crosschain swaps didn't exist, right?

[03-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
I believe their swaps are done using TAU as a proxy

[03-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
I haven't really followed their development

Using bitcoin as a security protocol is the only thing that makes sense. Using it as a currency, not so much. Its a bit of a dilemma. Anyone think there will be a way to reach consensus in a secure way without pow?

Lamden has pivoted since ICO.   Their CEO does nothing but trash talk other projects on twitter, or talk about profits and price action for node holders.

[04-Mar-19 06:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Be cautious.

[04-Mar-19 06:27 AM] Light Sage#4161
I think  both projects are good imo. Just dont like people egging on other projects for drama and coming on Komodo to say they are trash talking.

[04-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@El Rachistico  There are 3 tiers to the Amazon Web Services partner network: Registered, Standard, and Advanced

https://aws.amazon.com/partners/technology/journey/

Becoming a Registered AWS partner basically just means filling out a form. You might remember QTUM's "historic partnership" with AWS announced last October (https://ethereumworldnews.com/qtum-enters-historic-partnership-with-amazon-web-services/) but you can easily see that they are listed as a Registered Partner on the AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/results/?keyword=QTUM)

Becoming a Standard Technology Partner takes a bit more work, submitting some proposals and plans, etc. A few blockchain projects have achieved this level, including Zilliqa (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Zilliqa%20Research%20Pte%20Ltd&id=0010L00001sCcwAQAS)  and TRON (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=TRON%20Foundation&id=0010L00001u5snPQAQ).

Komodo is an Advanced Technology Partner. Getting to this stage requires a lot more vetting, detailed proposals of what the project hopes to accomplish with AWS, and technical validation of the proposed solutions.  (https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Komodo%20Platform&id=0010L00001sCXagQAG)

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ yes, I am gathering information specific to mining pool operators all into one place, to try to make it as easy as possible. Any mining pool that currently supports KMD AC's should have an easy time adding HUSH. Some pools that don't yet have any Sapling chains or KMD AC's, will have to do a bit more work
