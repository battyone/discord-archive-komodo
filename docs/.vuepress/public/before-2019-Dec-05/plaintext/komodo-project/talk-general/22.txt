I hope so, because the last generation cant make change if you hand them $20.01 for something that's $19.76

Last week I asked about using BarterDex for OTC trading

[06-Jul-18 07:27 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
James gave me some answers but unfortunately I've been too CLI challenged to succesfully test it

[06-Jul-18 07:27 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
This makes my point that for normal users we need a proper simple gui for OTC trading that uses the bdex protocol

[06-Jul-18 07:27 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Is anything already planned?

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
My idea is that when 2 people have agreed what they want to swap, one of them will use the gui to setup the trade selecting coins and amount

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
The gui will create a file or code to pass to the other user that will import it in his gui. The gui will then setup his side of the trade. Choosing netid and utxo splitting can be all simply done by the gui. The traders need only to deposit and proceed

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I want to offer a bounty of 25k KMD for such gui

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I can increase it if necessary

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I wonder what is the best way to proceed, I could find myself a developer

[06-Jul-18 07:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
or if Komodo team or Chainzilla, Komodo Pioneers or other group want to take up the task, let me know

I could make a PoC GUI for that without much hassle, but I doubt it would be very good.

[06-Jul-18 07:48 AM] jorian#4555
25k!

[06-Jul-18 07:48 AM] jorian#4555
nice bounty

[06-Jul-18 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently, you would need some backend marketmaker your could spin up in a cloud instance, with the correct firewall settings to act as the FL node, so in effect this app would not and could not be free to use, unless every person trading know how to setup the networking on his computer to create the network,

[06-Jul-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a nice bounty, unfortunate most of it would be needed to fund a FR node creation machine

[06-Jul-18 07:49 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand, so it is harder than expected

[06-Jul-18 07:50 AM] jorian#4555
why would one need a backend marketmaker?

[06-Jul-18 07:50 AM] jorian#4555
why is a prebuilt binary in combination with electrum not feasible?

[06-Jul-18 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need an unfirewalled public IP with a direct connection to internet

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cheapest way to do that, would be to docker it an lanch it in AWS on demand, and have it time ut and die after X hours.

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly expensive but has some cost

[06-Jul-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need a FR node to connect to

[06-Jul-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise you would need X FR nodes run somwherre and the app chooses randomly what one to use, much cheaper to launch on demand.

[06-Jul-18 07:53 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok I'm understanding less than half of what blackjok3r says except that my idea requires a lot more work than a gui üòê

[06-Jul-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we are talking cents per netid not dollars... its cheap, but not free.

[06-Jul-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
someone has to pay the cost.

[06-Jul-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and cloud providers take USD... not crypto

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] jorian#4555
ah, i get what blackjoker is saying. for a new network to work, some Full Relay nodes need to be spawned in that new network to relay the alice and bob msgs?

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You only need 1, then the GUI connects alic and bob to it

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] jorian#4555
i see

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the user has no worries about firewalls or any of that complicated stuff

(for my noob trading mind: OTC = Over The Counter?)

[06-Jul-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a large bounty, I can make a PoC, maybe for that much KMD someone else has a better idea

[06-Jul-18 07:56 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes OTC = over the counter

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] jorian#4555
and what is the purpose of otc?

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have work still left on scaling, if no one has attempted this I will give it a go when I am done with that.

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
for when you want to swap a specific amount with a specific person

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] jorian#4555

there are escrow services

[06-Jul-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I agree on its usefulness, and with its own network it *should* be very reliable

[06-Jul-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Hi, I was looking at notary nodes and how many blocks they mined, and I found that one of them mined a block with ~9924 KMD as reward. How can it be possible?

[06-Jul-18 12:29 PM] benohanlon#1119
@JackLeFou I'll take a guess it's because some centralized exchanges don't take their rewards from 5.1% and it gets sent back to the people mining... so you can play like a lottery if you're lucky getting that kind of block

[06-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[06-Jul-18 12:41 PM] JackLeFou#3655
Oh ok, I've missed this feature of Komodo mining. So if a miner does not claim his monthly reward then it is merged to the next mined block? Where can I find more info on it? (I've already read the white paper but haven't found anything on it). Thanks

[06-Jul-18 12:47 PM] benohanlon#1119
@JackLeFou I said if centralized exchanges don't claim their rewards they can be sent back to the miners. Ask in #talk-mining about this.

Certain people believe that only bitcoin will survive and all other altcoins are worthless. When i ask why they just say "because it is like this" im stunned with the amount of ignorance, rediculness, short and narrow viewed people are filling up social media.
Makes me wonder what the purpose and use social media has nowadays..

[06-Jul-18 12:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
As I understand it, most of those huge blocks came during the Block Nation dICO, and it was from ledger wallets, because they do not support the interest, the interest goes to the miner.
