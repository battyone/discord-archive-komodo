giving life to people suggestions is always very cool btw, it s the funniest thing that can be done... and I m really sure if this is started right after elections, you ll have plenty of dedicated people happy to help

[13-Apr-19 07:29 PM] Audo#5667
are we still talking about making some short of a page to showcase the Komodo ecosystem @Deleted User ?

[13-Apr-19 07:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
nope, here it was more an idea to develop side channels like dedicated "stackoverflow" style

[13-Apr-19 07:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
causr yeah, a big base of community questions and troobleshooting tips can really help

[13-Apr-19 07:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
showcasing the whole ecosystem in just a page seems more a work for true marketing team paired with tech people. Not sure that part should rely on external governance

[13-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, we, or at least me, I really don t know what s their plan / on their head, and wouldn t like to bring something very "commercial" (showcasing...) that wouldn t fit their needs

[13-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you are in charge of it...

[13-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
that d another subject ^^

[13-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
to me here it was more about setting up some sort of hub to make things less obscure when it comes to tech side

[13-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Audo#5667
yeah something like that definitely needs to be on the main domain.

I do see that there will be a need for a community run website that hlighlights and talks about the latest projects on the Komodo ecosystem: wallets, games, apps, ICO's ... we will have hard time highlighting that type of stuff through the official Komodo brand as that could be seen as an endorsement.

[13-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
like the election site, komodostats.com,notarystats and dexstats

[13-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
all those are precious services

[13-Apr-19 07:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
but you have to dig a little to get em

[13-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
a way to gather all community work question and answers was what I got in mi d

[13-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Audo#5667
yes, we need to unite all community efforts / projects like that

[13-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
at least that s what that stackoverflow made me think about

[13-Apr-19 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
therr are hidden services everywhere

[13-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Audo#5667
what if we make a channel on discord that everyone can read but only community supporters and ecosystem developers and notary nodes can write on?

[13-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
like bootstraping services or pools

[13-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Audo#5667
and we can plan/discuss there

[13-Apr-19 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
how can you determine Bryan452 is not a contributor ?

[13-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
we need this open to anyone

[13-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
people contributing will emerge by emselves

[13-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
but here again

[13-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s just my point of view

[13-Apr-19 07:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
your airtable was a cool start, but seems deprecated.

[13-Apr-19 07:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
uniting projects may be key to success

[13-Apr-19 07:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
it s already the case when you dig a little, but from the outside it s not so obvious

[13-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
the problem being to get this without being affiliated officially, for KMD

[13-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Audo#5667
sure we can keep it open to everyone. My thinking was that the discussion gets offreailed quickly if anyone can chat there, yeah you are right.

[13-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause we saw CALL, and it was one of the first example of why building an assetchain on kmd doesn t mean kmd is in charge of it

[13-Apr-19 07:43 PM] Audo#5667
well, I just made a new channel called #deleted-channel ‚Äì let's see what happens

[13-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
count me in ^^

[13-Apr-19 07:45 PM] Audo#5667
Within our team we have discussed how we should talk more to the key contributors and plan ahead. It's now or never üòÑ

[13-Apr-19 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
aside of this public channel you can also setup a private one for internal team members and ecosystem dev, but I think it s better to have everything public. People seem interested by those questions.

[13-Apr-19 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
and regularly can bring ideas

[13-Apr-19 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
it could just simply happen on general, but when you mix elections, and other stuff... it would just literally be the mess

[13-Apr-19 07:50 PM] Audo#5667
we can start with that and if you guys feel like we need a private one we can then make it

@FishyGuts sadly, I am the lead blockchain dev now xD

[14-Apr-19 05:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts but we are not gonna work old fashioned development style at K64.

[14-Apr-19 05:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The plan is that I want the future dev team to be Devops. We will have objectives, and who takes one on, takes responsibility of that objective. Instead of useless agile methodology, we will focus on MoSCoW. Must haves, Should haves, Could haves, Wont haves.

The blockchain development that will be done in-house at K64, is fairly scoped: the gaming SDK and Infra-added-value. We will mostly work towards the latter through our partner ChainMakers ( @siu - Chainmakers and @jorian ).

in a sense all assetchains in KMD is like dapps for ETH

someone is asking how decentralied KMD is

[14-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Tek#5253
if he hosts a DNM on an asset chain or whatever

[14-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Tek#5253
is there a "kmd team" to shut him down?

[14-Apr-19 09:52 AM] Tek#5253
"decentralized"

[14-Apr-19 09:53 AM] Tek#5253
i hate this meeme

[14-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont even know all the assetchains that people have launched. we would have no way to shut any chain down

[14-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we could however refuse to dPoW a chain, that is an extra service over and above the blockchain itself

[14-Apr-19 09:55 AM] Tek#5253
ok thnx

[14-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If he is running all the nodes

[14-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
how can the kmd team shut it down?

[14-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Tek#5253
he probably thinks its EOS tier

[14-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah only god-tier tech over here

[14-Apr-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there is so much low quality tech in this space calling itself decentralized, when it isnt, people seem to be used to it not meaning much. that komodo is in most aspects way toward the decentralized end of the spectrum, maybe is a surprise

[14-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think the problem is that most people already have their mind made up before diving into the technicalities of projects.

[14-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And they will search for things that coincide with their pre-existing views

[14-Apr-19 10:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I see a lot of people that once I start explaining what kmd does and how it works and what you can do using kmd tech, they almost dont believe me because of how advanced it is

[14-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
KMD really is the swiss pocket knife of crypto, where a veriblock for example pretends to be 51% protection, or 0x pretends to be a DEX, or XRP pretends to be able to do 20k+ tx/s, kmd can do all of these things and much more

[14-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
AND most of the times it can do these things in a far superior manner.

[14-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Slowly but surely I have a feeling more and more people are seeing this, with the rebrand coming and more projects coming over to the fun side, it's only a matter of time before kmd is a top 20 - top 10 project üòÉ

@Cryptoon in honesty, when you "think" you know blockchain technology, Komodo is something different. However, reading the whitepaper and the new documentation will help to make it easier. There is still a lot to be done, and n00b questions never tend to cease.

the vote chain was mined before the snapshot and it was not clear how big the eff. supply will be.
