The weather in darwin is always 32C every day 365 days a year, all that varies is rain/no rain.

@KomodoWorld noted on your OTC trade GUI.  First thing is a secure bob gui.  I've already chatted with @blackjok3r about it in the past few weeks.   It'll be in my thoughts over the coming month or two.

[07-Jul-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep and the FR node needs its marketmaker in a VPS I think, we would need to test say 100 trades with bob as electrum and `canbind:0`on our own netid and see what kind of success/failure rate we get.  Because in this situation all trades would be done serially it *should* work.

[07-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah looking forward to those kinds of tests and analytics 😃

In other news, I found my old nursepaging source code from 2002-2006 for nurse call integration and posted to github today.
It follows from a question on reddit about what dApps will be on the komodo platform.

@Mylo @blackjok3r if you need some funds for testing expenses, let me know

[07-Jul-18 09:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Too many projects on at once. Need to finish scale test then I will move onto this as main focus. Terrible at GUI, but if we can get a working back end, a GUI is easy.

[07-Jul-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
be careful to say a GUI is easy 😅

[07-Jul-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555

lol... I wont be the one making it so, I can say its easy all I like :trollface:

[07-Jul-18 09:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If nobody does anything, I'll make it in VB6

[07-Jul-18 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
a gui? 😄

[07-Jul-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, thats the only way I have ever made one, and man it was a long time ago. I remeber it being super easy though.

The following is the discussion with the person from Malta who is one of the designers of the strategy regarding blockchain laws. It might have interesting and fruitful results regarding decentralized laws.

I read somewhere Switzerland  is quite open to crypto.  Actually it make sense for financial based country. Malta also is one.

[07-Jul-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
Malta is now a safe haven for exchanges

[07-Jul-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
And Switzerland, if you have the 50K for incorporation you are golden

[07-Jul-18 02:51 PM] PTYX#6840
They now will require banks to service crypto companies

I've been speaking with someone from the Curaçao government and apparently they are a little behind but are planning on following Switzerland's lead

[07-Jul-18 02:54 PM] jorian#4555
Interesting

[07-Jul-18 03:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
there were some stories Malta gov is corrupted, which  may be both good or bad for crypto, depending who is corrupting their gov. Also I read Malta by far is not so crypto friendly as it is written on internet. Basically what I was reading there is more gossips then confirmed law on crypto/taxes. The misscomunication comes from interpreting some politicians being for crypto as "law changes, while it's usually their "private opinion" shared on tv which is not the same as actual law. However may be cheaper to have lawyer support on Malta then Switzerland.

[07-Jul-18 04:10 PM] PTYX#6840
i have found that malta, switzerland, singapore, and lietchenstein are for people with money

[07-Jul-18 04:11 PM] PTYX#6840
other jurisdictions like Cayman, nevis, panama, and soon curacao will be more affordable
