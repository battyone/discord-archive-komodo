we are going back to what money was for the longest time

[02-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Fab√ò#8941
IOY btw people living in the same space and capable of enforcing the deal (most of the time)

[02-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Fab√ò#8941
money was a oral of written contract btw a debtor and creditor

[02-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Fab√ò#8941
well KSB is going back to that

[02-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Fab√ò#8941
at stage 1, KSB is backed by $ cash and paper money (T-bill) and asset backed loans

[02-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Fab√ò#8941
1 KSB = $1 = cash $ X + secured debt $ Y

[02-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Fab√ò#8941
what is also interesting to us is the use of KSB

[02-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
KSB checks all the functions of money

[02-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
unit of mesure, of credit, storage, etc...

[02-Jan-19 02:53 PM] PTYX#6840
interesting, so there is no underlying crypto asset right? since it's backed by Cash and loans denominated in fiat?

[02-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Nope directly, you have an indirect exposure as the loans are backed by crypto assets collateral.

[02-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Fab√ò#8941
the risk is close to 0% as the collateral need to be at all time above 125%

[02-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Fab√ò#8941
failing to comply = liquidation

[02-Jan-19 02:56 PM] PTYX#6840
right, i read about that yesterday. But what happens if the crypto loans faulted? I understand the 125% covers the offset but that would be like depositing 125 dollars  to create 100 usable dollars.

[02-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Loans are reimburses

[02-Jan-19 02:56 PM] PTYX#6840
or the crypto assets crashed?

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
great question

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
so you can borrow up to 40% of the $ value of your deposited crypto assets

[02-Jan-19 02:57 PM] Fab√ò#8941
crypto can from there drop up to 50%

[02-Jan-19 02:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
in that case you are at 80% of your collateral

[02-Jan-19 02:58 PM] Fab√ò#8941
(the 125%)

[02-Jan-19 02:59 PM] Fab√ò#8941
every time you got above this limit the delta btw 80 and what is above get liquidated

[02-Jan-19 03:00 PM] PTYX#6840
Do you have a whitepaper. I'd love to read more about it. I've been doing alot of research on stable coins recently. It's an interesting subject.

[02-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
there is one

[02-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
sending it to you

[02-Jan-19 03:00 PM] Fab√ò#8941
I am happy to talk work with you on the matter

stablecoin is a big thing for our ecosystem

[02-Jan-19 03:04 PM] Fab√ò#8941

@SHossain hello, i read the anouncement. Have you contacted with binance about it? They still has 120 confs for komodo

[03-Jan-19 03:20 PM] SHossain#0007
Binance uses their own custom solution. ca333 will talk to them.

[03-Jan-19 03:21 PM] dokrates#8987
Would be nice to reduce confirmations to 10-20 in binance, they have higher volume

[03-Jan-19 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Or you could just deposit 2 hrs in advance of dumping :trollface:

Komodo team made an announcement about it few days ago. 1 is enough to prevent double spending

[03-Jan-19 11:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's actually 2 confirmations

[03-Jan-19 11:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
1  means "confirmed or notarized with 1 conf" while 2 means "notarized with 2 confs", so in theory, exchanges could lower their confirmation requirements to 2

Hello! I have my Komodo on a Ledger hardware wallet, and I missed out on the news that Ledger would disable support for Komodo following the Dec 15 hard fork. So my question is; is there any way to transfer my Komodo out from my Ledger without using Ledger Live (which now has no support for Komodo)? Thanks in advance

[04-Jan-19 01:19 PM] bishop#9773
Use your seed in agama to get the private key to the address that holds your KMD, then you can move it from Agama

[04-Jan-19 01:22 PM] StrHika#9192
Do you mean the 12-word passphrase from the Ledger? I tried to import it in Agama, but it didn't work. Is there a different seed you mean?

I think KMD needs decent tool for managing projects, community needs (polls) and fundraising. Is there a place where we can see funds raised for specific projects? Also Projects progress? A place where we can see how many people are interested in such project like example Ledger nano claim app ?
