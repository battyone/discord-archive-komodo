`The question must be who designed this efficient C coding and natural talking AI?` - my GAN system

[10-May-19 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
GAN?

just sent Elke Schroth a msg on linkedin (I have a fake account there but I don't use somebody elses pic)

[10-May-19 03:51 PM] SHossain#0007
how can i convert myself AI?

[10-May-19 03:51 PM] Alexfrog#1338
What i learned from this drama is that the komodo community is too smart and can unravel scams!  Looking through that twitter account, she's been posting stuff about different cryptos for quite a while.  And none of them figured it out lol.

Wait for James to reach the point where you can become AI @SHossain

@Alexfrog  what you should remember is that the team reacted very fast. I wrote them only yesterday and now we all know the true.

[10-May-19 03:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[10-May-19 03:53 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[10-May-19 03:59 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i wonder what the scammer's plan was though with the announcement

[10-May-19 03:59 PM] Alexfrog#1338
we probably wont find out now since we blew their cover lol

[10-May-19 03:59 PM] Pumtchak#0362
@Malti the Lydia impersonator is most probably here reading this, i must be bummed to be exposed too üòà

All he needed was his chain frens.

[10-May-19 04:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
nah they probably werent reading this, because they wouldve seen us be onto them earlier, and wouldnt have replied to ca333 the way they did?

because your twitter handle has komodo, so it can be misinterpreted as an official response

[10-May-19 04:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338

https://github.com/AstrohackerX/StandartLife contains their chaindetails - their seednodes are hosted on DigitalOcean which means chances are high they used some legit payment method - we should be able to track them back through this path. 

thanks @Alright for support on this
