Seemed like an unbeatable strategy at the time

I remember when I made a ton of 12 cent profit trades on BTC and then paid 200% tax on them, does that count?

It's almost tragic when people like Resistor join @ 7am, the rest of the day seems so much more empty after that much fun 😦

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] c2k#4915
anyone just notice a spike in that Komodo dICO called EQLI?

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I was jus t

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
wondering about that!

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
huge movement on exrates lol

[18-Sep-18 02:44 PM] Buddz1993#5380
spiked from 25 sats to 70

[18-Sep-18 02:45 PM] c2k#4915
damn. maybe something going on from the dev side

[18-Sep-18 02:45 PM] c2k#4915
wonder if the komodo team knows something they want to share?

[18-Sep-18 02:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I heard they are launching masternodes built with crypto conditions with a very good reward system in place

[18-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
maybe thas the cause of the spike  in price

[18-Sep-18 02:46 PM] c2k#4915
that would be awesome. i really need to read up on crypto conditions 🤔

[18-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but we have komodo devs here they can confirm it to us 😄

[18-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye its  mind blowing  you should

[18-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
a lot of people dont realize how big it is

[18-Sep-18 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and adding these type os´´f ´´´´

[18-Sep-18 02:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
types of masternodes*

[18-Sep-18 02:48 PM] c2k#4915
👍

[18-Sep-18 02:50 PM] c2k#4915
When you look at the EQLI richlist it seems like it has a lot of room to expand. 
maybe the spike in price just came from someone looking for a bag

[18-Sep-18 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye completly aggreed , I ,mean a lot of people are gonna FOMO very soon

[18-Sep-18 02:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
seems like a project that has big places to go and a lot of room to expand for sure~

[18-Sep-18 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as they FOMO before I place my next equipment order :trollface:

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] c2k#4915
what equipment you referring too?

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm a miner

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] c2k#4915
i dont think EQLI is minable. just masternodes

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
eqli will have mn

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
not minable ye

[18-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
mn's based with komodo crypto conditions

[18-Sep-18 02:53 PM] c2k#4915
we were discussing how the price spiked this morning @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and how maybe something is going on from the dev side

[18-Sep-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my mistake, I saw EQLI and thought you meant the EQL assetchain

[18-Sep-18 02:54 PM] c2k#4915
no. im not familiar with EQL but  EQLI is a Komodo dICO

[18-Sep-18 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380

its srsly simple to understand and to know this is just the beggining of the spike we saw today~

[18-Sep-18 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looks like same folks doing 2 chains 🤔

[18-Sep-18 02:58 PM] c2k#4915
early on i think they were EQL, but because someone else had that symbol they changed to EQLI. but project is the same...building affordable and durable homes

[18-Sep-18 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, if it's the same chain and just a different ticker symbol, then my original statement stands 😃

[18-Sep-18 03:08 PM] snowdamn#2414
KMD has its own crypto universe

[18-Sep-18 03:09 PM] Buddz1993#5380
indeed thats for sure true

[18-Sep-18 03:10 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it doesnt change the fact that EQLI are upping up their game with those MN'S

[18-Sep-18 03:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
KMD universe is expanding 🤓

[18-Sep-18 03:13 PM] snowdamn#2414
now if i could remember which address of mine holds which asset THAT WOULD BE GREAT 😂

132882 EQLI blocks have been mined, for the record 😛

[18-Sep-18 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
albeit that the reward is only 0.0001 EQL per block

[18-Sep-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181

Im EQL mined block whale :trollface:

[18-Sep-18 03:40 PM] c2k#4915
why mine when u can go to the exchange and buy it for 20-30 sats!

[18-Sep-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why mine when u can go to the exchange and buy it for 20-30 sats!`
Because otherwise the CPUs in a GPU rig sit mostly idle...

[18-Sep-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, mining assetchains is basically "free"

[18-Sep-18 03:41 PM] c2k#4915
there are much better returns out there for mining.

[18-Sep-18 03:41 PM] c2k#4915
imo

[18-Sep-18 03:42 PM] c2k#4915
even within the kmd ecosystem

[18-Sep-18 03:42 PM] c2k#4915
but EQLI was talking about masternodes with 10% -25% rewards.

[18-Sep-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there isn't anything in the Komodo system that I know about and don't mine (other than many of the test chains)

[18-Sep-18 03:43 PM] c2k#4915
for me mining kmd & hush have been a waste of electricity. would rather buy on CEX or BDEX

[18-Sep-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my whole 0.6sol/s is not worth anything

[18-Sep-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it can mine EQL while it cant mine anythig else... .and tis the oppisite of cost, as my notary node is a capped power fee, if I dont use it I pay for it anyway.

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`for me mining kmd & hush have been a waste of electricity`
true, except when they are not

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😉

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] c2k#4915
but arent there more rewarding kmd ecosystem coins to mine @blackjok3r

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and wihtout blocks being forced mined on all AC atomic swaps dont really work so good... so its win wint for everyone.

I mine anything under difficulty 50, which is anything no one else is mining.

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never touched the address.

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] c2k#4915
ah

[18-Sep-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mines to pubkey

[18-Sep-18 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_was pretty much the 1st person to decimate the concept of block-on-demand_

[18-Sep-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
i hate mining lol

[18-Sep-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then you don't want my job 😛

[18-Sep-18 03:47 PM] c2k#4915
i got started mining vrsc 2 wks ago. i feel so late to the game

[18-Sep-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
i hate it, but respek it

[18-Sep-18 03:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2 months ago was "late" for VRSC unless you use the new GPU miner with a fair amount of GPUs

[18-Sep-18 03:48 PM] c2k#4915
block rewards were so nice inthe beginning. lol

[18-Sep-18 03:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
cloud rentals rekt the VRSC diff for average users

[18-Sep-18 03:49 PM] c2k#4915
thats why i bot a bunch of EQLI. figured when things get going there, buying below 50sats will be like essentially getting free coins. and make up for me not mining VRSC or KMD at the very beginning

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mining KMD has been very, very good to me 😁

[18-Sep-18 03:52 PM] c2k#4915
what cards?

[18-Sep-18 03:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
started with 1080Ti, now have Z9 minis

[18-Sep-18 03:53 PM] c2k#4915
gotcha. i was using 1070 for a while but rewards wereent really worth it to me

[18-Sep-18 03:54 PM] c2k#4915
more efficient returns elsewhere

[18-Sep-18 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I originally got the 1st batch of my 1080Tis to participate in Stanford's distributed computing program, but the market fell out of that and I found equihash and then Komodo

[18-Sep-18 03:55 PM] c2k#4915
lucky you. kmd is an amazing ecosystem

A lot of coins talk about "community", but Komodo is the 1st (and only) one that I've found where any random jackass (specifically me) can come along with a decent suggestion and it gets real consideration based on the merits
