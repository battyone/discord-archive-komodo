ddin't know about blockstack doing PoB, will look into it, thanks

[23-Feb-19 02:56 AM] Gawain#7858
i don't think it drives up cost of service - if miners can't afford to mine, they stop mining. they can only afford to mine what the system rewards them to mine at that specific coin price at that specific reward rate

[23-Feb-19 03:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notarization requires data in opreturn,  that has a cost per byte.  It’s going to be a bit more than 10 sats.    Assuming costs of a notarization remain stable, when you are destroying a finite resource , it makes the process more expensive .  Selling a new coin mining profits for BTC to fund the notarizations has much issue as well,  you are increasing necessarily supply available on market of the intermediate coin ( the coin you are swapping for btc ) which drives price in btc downwhile driving price up in fiat of btc through burn.  Seems like shooting your self in the foot, twice.

[23-Feb-19 03:08 AM] Gawain#7858
from my perspective that's more of a price issue, not a security one: if emission of kmd is small enough, it shouldn't significantly affect kmd/btc price while helping distribute it and thus control over the economy to countless people on the market which is a good thing. kmd fees would also be paying for notaries without making new coins and helping distribute them.

[23-Feb-19 03:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m Business Development so that’s more how my mind thinks.   As you see there is competitors arising in the 51% attack protection space And from a consumer perspective which would they choose, one that is more expensive ( Veriblock method ) one that drives up the cost of using the service ( Blockstack method ) or one that does neither.( Komodo method ) .  The only difference is decentralization,  which KMD has 64 elected by sortition nodes responsible for the process, with over 100 individuals/teams at the wheel.  Most ( but not all ) are public facing at least to the point that you can be assured there is actually different people running them.  Versus the free model, where anyone can be a part of the notarization process but doesn’t limit or have a way of knowing if it’s just one person controlling the majority of nodes doing the notarization.  Illusion of decentralization.   Also the problem with the free model is system requirements ,  to secure 3rd party chains you need to run their node, not an option for just “anybody”.

[23-Feb-19 04:56 AM] Don King#8901
Competition for NN spots is very high, guaranteed easy mining returns makes that a certainty. I predict we end up with 64 independent operators, all contributing to the ecosystem in different ways, some developers, some infrastructure, some marketing, and the remainder get elected by offering voter rewards in a competitive market. There will be no free riding NN's, a combo of cooperation & competition will weed out any bad actors. The NN selection system is a great foundation for the whole ecosystem.

[23-Feb-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
1600 KMD per month will take about 52 years to amass 1 million KMD,which is the minimum level needed to secure a position. assuming you never spend any

[23-Feb-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the scale is too small to worry about NN accumulating enough KMD to lock themselves in. also the annual voting, the voters will have a lot of KMD to vote for the competent operators and if they are competent, why shouldnt they win?

Anyone noticed the failed 51% attack on @einsteiniumcoin the last days? Over 100 orphan blocks after a set of re-org. But not a block behind the dpow checkpoints. It is looking as @KomodoPlatform made a good job with #dPoW. PING[ @geocold51 ]
