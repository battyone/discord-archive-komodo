its really nice! Decker loves cryptopuzzles (so do i) - i will try to get you one at least once a month. But something different and with a couple of levels.

Hi. I would like to know if there is any instructions how to run testnet of Komodo on my server?

[27-Jan-19 04:18 PM] ca333#0118
@DavidFLX plz check #kmdlabs or #ask-a-question 
for your info: setting up a fresh assetchain (which is a runtime for of komodo) would be like running a testnet. same base58 prefixes and key format/encoding. only difference is that its solely your own testnet - you can make it public (for the whole community) or keep it private (for your company/lab).

Does anyone have any suggestion for which open source license to use in this case: I’m writing some software for someone; I want them to be able to use it freely, do whatever hey want, sell it whatever, but I want to protect myself/retain rights in the event that I ever decide to sell it/use it for my own purposes.

[27-Jan-19 06:05 PM] tolken#2655
I basically just don’t want anyone to be able to come after me saying that I stole their code, when I wrote it originally.

[27-Jan-19 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@tolken MIT = "weakest" = they need to mention you if they publish

[27-Jan-19 06:06 PM] tolken#2655
noted, thanks CG. I’m not even overly concerned about a mention (other than to strengthen the point that I have rights to it)

the KMD withdrawl fees are extremely low on binance

[27-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
the fun part is that I don't really lose anything at all cause staking gets me back some KMD

[27-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
im just buying and withdrawing to my address instead of keeping it on exchange and trying to swing trade.

[27-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
Many times I've sold early. I need to stop that

[27-Jan-19 09:41 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
The only bad thing @Tek is that when you want to sell, you have to wait too much until the deposit is complete.. 😕

[27-Jan-19 09:45 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
But yes, Im hodling too on my wallet😋

[27-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
ah yeah

[27-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
the 120 confirmations

[27-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
I shouldn't be selling anytime soon anyway.

[27-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
I'm pretty confident that KMD will appreciate in value many times what I paid for it

[27-Jan-19 10:43 PM] Tek#5253
that's when I should sell

[27-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
So the 120 confirmations on binance is like a blessing, cause I can't sell on impulse lol

[27-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Tek#5253
I was hoping I could keep a part of my KMD staked forever though, never selling.

[27-Jan-19 10:45 PM] Tek#5253
I'll sell maybe 30% of my stack at 10x the price it is now, is what I'm thinking

[27-Jan-19 10:45 PM] Tek#5253
rest i'll keep forever.

[27-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Tek#5253
maybe sell some stakes every now and then but yeah.

[28-Jan-19 05:38 AM] Northman#5121
@Tek when you say staking do you mean that feature in the Agama wallet? Or something else?

[28-Jan-19 05:47 AM] Alecandro#1179
Why the f does binance have 120 confirmations for KMd deposits? That’s dumb af

We see hunderts of projects with massive marketing and no product, patience will be rewarded in the end but following Komodo I become more educated to understand how  this society workd and why  privacy is important in our life,leave your daily coffee,eat healthier and buy Komodo,become expert in one project

The exchange purge has started. @Liqui_Exchange is closing.

I believe many more, especially smaller exchanges will follow. The bull market forced them to make large investments in their IT infrastructure, and the bear market dried out the trading volume.

@bogybogy there might be 200,000 people that call themselves blockchain devs, but in my humble opinion, there are much fewer devs that know blockchain internals. Perhaps that is 200K people who want to write smart contracts, but even that seems like more than currently exist

[28-Jan-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
not all coders are equivalent

[28-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you can write macros for excel and in some sense you are a coder

[28-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can be writing new blockchain consensus algo

[28-Jan-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
both are a single coder

[28-Jan-19 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Anthony somebody needs to make an official release of komodo and package it up and then submit to debian/ubuntu and then people could do `apt-get install komodo`. Or people can do `apt-add-repository` and use our custom KMD repo, then we don't need it submitted/approved upstream (which takes time)

[28-Jan-19 02:58 PM] Anthony#6143
@TonyL

[28-Jan-19 03:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and *somebody* needs to maintain that release as well

[28-Jan-19 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Exactly, I wouldn't suggest even "getting the ball rolling" on that without ensuring that a specific person (and not *someone*) is willing and able to do the work

[28-Jan-19 04:13 PM] PTYX#6840
that's a great idea though

[28-Jan-19 04:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I like the idea, just not a fan of starting it without a dedicated person to maintain. I think the "harm" to rep would be greater than the "good" if not maintained and a hf causes issues

[28-Jan-19 04:19 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah, that's definitely an topic in it of itself.

[28-Jan-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think it's enough work to maintain that KMD would fund the person maintaining it, if it's something they want to pursue

[29-Jan-19 02:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@benohanlon also this kind of ann could be "chained" maybe for better PR building? I mean to publish it first on reddit and then reddit linkt publish here and on twitter - so that people upvote reddit maybe and KMD get more attention (new people)? Currently if it is only published within current user base it's partially "wasted" - no getting new user base
