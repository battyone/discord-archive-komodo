The blocks they are in are from transactions without nLocktime set or from exchanges running their native in exchange mode.   If you claim longer than monthly the coins just don't get generated, it caps at 1/12 of 5 percent

[10-Sep-18 03:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already found a 4KMD block since the 1 month activation 😄

[10-Sep-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those massive blocks, might be a thing of the past, but mining reqards from ledgers should now be spread a bit more evenly I think.

@Poloniex @QtumOfficial Hey guys, you already received a couple of mails during past year that BTCD was transferred to KMD, and so after transferal period of 1 year BTCD is not in use at all. Please replace it on your exchange or at least delist BTCD for users sake.

My brain hurts each time I see a BTCD pump

[10-Sep-18 01:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe delisting dead coins is no brainer and not many hours needed for that, they are not carring about customers if they have such delays

[10-Sep-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
likely easier to ignore our emails than ignore the hundreds they get from people who didn't do their due diligence and are still buying/selling/holding BTCD on their exchange

[10-Sep-18 01:32 PM] Alright#0419

@PTYX  might be good if KMD DEX ann date after which adding coins to Agama / DEX will be paid (but do nto ann the amount)  just for marketing purpose

[10-Sep-18 01:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
amount could be set later and be small actually

[10-Sep-18 02:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
can maybe anyone give me a hint:
I have Agama 0.2.41d-beta - is this the latest one?
I accessed my KMD today and claimed interest w/o any problem, so this should be the latest version, with block 1M and all that, correct?

[10-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
what block height are you on?

[10-Sep-18 02:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
good Q - I need to check ... but I hope larger 1M becasue I calimed interest successfully

[10-Sep-18 02:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
brb

[10-Sep-18 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
first of all, were you using native or lite mode? I believe that's the correct version, but I could tell you for sure if you tell me the block height

[10-Sep-18 02:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
lite mode

[10-Sep-18 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
if it's lite mode and it's working, you're on the correct chain

[10-Sep-18 02:40 PM] LocoMB#8593
yay! Thanks! (not that I was worried, but needed to check anyway)

[10-Sep-18 02:41 PM] LocoMB#8593
crypto going slow ... seen these slumps, I feel reminded of 2015 when it went sideways between $200 and $250 for a full year

[10-Sep-18 11:39 PM] bishop#9773
So how does the rewards calc work with rewards prior to block 1M. For instance, if I had funds that haven't claimed rewards on since a month prior, do they accrue all of September or what?

[10-Sep-18 11:40 PM] bishop#9773
just curious how the one month calc is done

[11-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Hermes#6934
The rule consists now that you will need to do it once a month , if you claimed a month ago and you claim for instance today it will be the same as before

[11-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Hermes#6934
just that from now on is obligatory to claim monthly.

[11-Sep-18 12:09 AM] bishop#9773
And I get that, but in my situation, if I didn't claim today, does it accrue to the end of September or does it cap out? I only ask because in this situation, I would be over the one month mark but with the block change, no idea

[11-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Hermes#6934
If you had past rewards before the network rules change you could have claimed then now,  but if you are asking if that rule is retroactive like if that will take in account the last time you did before block  1 mm it won't make too much sense because the rule has just been applied from the block 1 mm and beyond

[11-Sep-18 12:17 AM] bishop#9773
I'm just asking if anyone that didn't claim prior to block 1M is accuring rewards or if they stop toward the end of september/early october

[11-Sep-18 12:17 AM] bishop#9773
did rewards stop the second block 1M happened I guess is the simpliest

[11-Sep-18 12:19 AM] Hermes#6934
I still accrued rewards that were previous the 1 mm change and we also tested it , we claimed the rewards just after the 1 mm block and one hour later we claimed them again.

[11-Sep-18 12:20 AM] bishop#9773
so in that situation, it sounds like they will accrue through september, no?

[11-Sep-18 12:20 AM] bishop#9773
then cap out

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] bishop#9773
Don't get me wrong, I already claim once a month (sometimes twice) but more or less curious if I have until the end of the month or if unclaimed at block 1M is capped

[11-Sep-18 12:22 AM] bishop#9773
just haven't seen anything clear regarding it

[11-Sep-18 12:32 AM] Hermes#6934
Yes , it's a good question although block 1 mm was on the 7th of Sept in the night , will keep you posted to clarify this

[11-Sep-18 12:36 AM] bishop#9773
Yep, I was around when it happened. More curiosity than anything

[11-Sep-18 12:37 AM] bishop#9773
Thanks!

[11-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
@bishop UTXOs that were created prior to block 1M won't cap for a year

[11-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Alright#0419
