if BTC price goes below 500$, yes we'lll be in trouble

[07-Jan-19 09:23 PM] Ludom#5832
But not just because the hashrate could goes down

good night mates, time to sleep

[08-Jan-19 02:34 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Honestly even if bitcoin became unsecure komodo would fair fine, because notaries mine a grand majority of the blocks no matter what the hashrate is point blank period. Good luck getting a notaries to conspire.

All Proof-of-Work cryptocoins with less hashrate than Bitcoin will be 51% attacked. $ETC had no defenses. The most prepared coins will have multiple defenses + $KMD delayed-Proof-of-Work is one of the best. I will be helping $SUQA + various other coins add dPoW in 2019! ...

does'nt a successful 51% attack mean that a coin is dead sort of ... dead?!? as in, circling the drain? üï≥ so this would only leave the Q if it was really that, or as ETC team claims 'something else, deeply arcane and technical'
makes me wonder- about the market again, with broken trash like VERGE still hovering around there

I'm new to Komodo and trying to read up on it. Figured Discord would be a faster way to get answers. So, my question is, if Komodo uses BTC in dPoW, won't Komodo fees increase when BTC fees increase? Won't Komodo fees always be higher than BTC fees, because the blockchain ledger has to be written to Komodo notaries and also the BTC blockchain?

[08-Jan-19 01:48 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Also, I'm very interested in side channels like Lightning as the future of scaling blockchain tech. Where can I learn more about how Komodo will be using Lightning?

[08-Jan-19 02:01 PM] jorian#4555
Komodo doesn't use lightning, but Komodo has assetchains; completely independent blockchains

[08-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html

[08-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
bit technical, but it shows what is possible

[08-Jan-19 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
combine it with BTC security, CryptoConditions smart contract support and you have a killer blockchain. who needs sidechains?

[08-Jan-19 02:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@garbonzo607 Komodo fees don't increase if Bitcoin fees increase, only an hash gets written into BTC blockchain. It's a single tx that costs a normal Bitcoin fee and it's paid by Notary Nodes

[08-Jan-19 02:06 PM] jorian#4555
the BTC required for those fees were raised in KMD's ICO 2 years ago and can last several more years. Unless lightning doesn't work and we keep using high BTC tx fees

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] dokrates#8987

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] dokrates#8987

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] dokrates#8987

[08-Jan-19 03:17 PM] dokrates#8987

unlikely by Q1, it is an ongoing process

[08-Jan-19 03:29 PM] jorian#4555
we have no idea in what stage it is, since there hasn't been any news around the rebrand

[08-Jan-19 03:29 PM] jorian#4555
the only thing known is the website got a facelift

[08-Jan-19 03:29 PM] jorian#4555
and since even james says unlikely q1, it probably will be a tuesday in 2019

[08-Jan-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
rebrand is not any single event. do people realize this?

Hyperdex is friendlier for new users...

[08-Jan-19 05:47 PM] Acura#2748
CoinCollect also uses Barterdex Engine - Zaddex will use CC from Komodo i think

[08-Jan-19 05:50 PM] Arboreal#3777
How are they? Easy to use? Liquidity

[08-Jan-19 05:51 PM] Jack Smith#8007
slow

[08-Jan-19 05:52 PM] Arboreal#3777
uh... Really?

[08-Jan-19 05:56 PM] cw#1047
well it is a DEX

[08-Jan-19 05:56 PM] cw#1047
from a UX standpoint, most of them are still a work in progress

[08-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Jack Smith#8007
@Arboreal  my experience with DEX in general

[08-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Honeybadger#5573
I have used both Arboreal; barterdex I used a long long while ago however. I would say experience is medium, I like hyperdex better though. Do try it and let me know!

I want more DEX like hyperdex to be honest, we should have multiple working DEXs with their own plus points and negatives.

[08-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Arboreal#3777
there are a lot of DEXes coming up and tbh I am afraid they will dilute the liquidity

[08-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Mink#9547
Yea liquidity is always the issue with exchanges - I do like the GUI bu definitely for more experience traders.

[08-Jan-19 06:02 PM] cw#1047
well as is usually the case with emerging tech, a couple of them will eventually capture the hearts and minds of users and take up the lion's share of the market

[08-Jan-19 06:02 PM] cw#1047
liquidity will be a problem for most of them but one or two will likely emerge as the dominant players

[08-Jan-19 06:03 PM] Arboreal#3777
I hope we'll see one one the Komodo platform

it's really hard to predict... back in my day, radarrelay was supposed to be the next big thing

[08-Jan-19 06:06 PM] cw#1047
but it basically never took off lol

[08-Jan-19 06:07 PM] Arboreal#3777
what is radarrelay?

[08-Jan-19 06:09 PM] cw#1047
DEX built on 0x protocol

[08-Jan-19 06:09 PM] cw#1047
it was supposed to be the first serious alternative to etherdelta

[08-Jan-19 06:09 PM] cw#1047
instead it just stumbled out of the gates and died instantly

[08-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Arboreal#3777
ahh okay

[08-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Arboreal#3777
what do you think should a DEX do not to instadie?

[08-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Arboreal#3777
provide liquidity?

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] cw#1047
binance DEX has to be the favorite tbh, lets be realistic

[08-Jan-19 06:15 PM] cw#1047
but I think there's some other promising contenders

[08-Jan-19 06:16 PM] cw#1047
BarterDEX & ResDEX are two I'm keeping an eye on

[08-Jan-19 06:26 PM] Arboreal#3777
BarterDEX because Komodo, Binance because, well, Binance, and ResDEX because...?

[08-Jan-19 06:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
did anyone ever go into the details how 'decentralized' BinanceDEX exactly is?
could be interesting if they have some plug they can pull if they deem it neccessary

[08-Jan-19 06:34 PM] cw#1047
hard to say Loco, I don't think any info on that is available yet at all... but of course the binance brand will obviously serve them very well.

[08-Jan-19 06:34 PM] cw#1047
I think it's likely that they'll have all kinds of kill switches

[08-Jan-19 06:38 PM] cw#1047
ResDEX because they have some features that I think will really appeal to privacy enthusiasts @Arboreal , which lets face it are a large segment of those who are interested in decentralized exchanges

[08-Jan-19 06:52 PM] Arboreal#3777
