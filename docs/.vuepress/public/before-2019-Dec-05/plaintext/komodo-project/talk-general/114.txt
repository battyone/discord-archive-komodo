a few million, I would consider a whale. guess it's subjective.

If you have over a million you can just about gaurentee yourself a notary node ... guess thats whale.

Is the price pumping via PnD or is there news?

I love how 1/2 of the recovery to where price was over a year ago is "pumping"

[25-Oct-18 03:50 AM] shak3nbak3#2279
Right? In this bear market any movement above 10% is a pump

3x 22MB files sent over streamer, all were able to be extracted from blockchain using an RPC call. 😄

[25-Oct-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This thing is totally limited by network bandwidth, at least on a RYZEN 2700X CPU, and I am using only 1/4 of that CPU to do this.

[25-Oct-18 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Leaves plenty left over to encode the video stream.

Video streaming via blockchain!!! 😃

[25-Oct-18 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its been a long couple of days to get that RPC working... had to rethink strategy half way through and go back and change the way I was sending data.

[25-Oct-18 10:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But its really really fast and efficiant.

[25-Oct-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can handle more than 1 stream per chain. But if there was too many finding them would prove a little hard ... seek though blocks and look for small ones, theres always a small block, where it charges up the blaster before the next stream begins.

[25-Oct-18 10:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so basically you can make a fully decentralized mega-upload ?

[25-Oct-18 10:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
where you pay with crypto for downloading / streaming

[25-Oct-18 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
streaming as in youtube. data on top of a blockchain. data in the blocks. in chunks.

[25-Oct-18 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the kinda streaming which no authority can block

[25-Oct-18 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and each part or bit of that video leaves a proof on the blockchain how it was at the time of streaming.

[25-Oct-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
example, can redirect live tv video to a video streaming chain. anything going in that stream is always be there till at least that copy of blockchain exists.

[25-Oct-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a single blockchain won't be enough for this

[25-Oct-18 10:18 AM] pika143#3754
good day

[25-Oct-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it has to be on-demand new chain spawning for each video stream or two.

[25-Oct-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r can of course explain more in detail and correct.

[25-Oct-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes that's pretty much it.. Each stream is a new chain although they can have more than 1from same creator in same chain

[25-Oct-18 11:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
can you clarify this- the stream is transient and is _not_ stored on the blockchain, but BC is used as some kind of a  conduit, right? 🛁 
or else I would suspect some really dark black magic bcs BC should not be a feasible storage medium .. 🌋 👿 ⛪ ✝

[25-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a new block chain for each stream, which can be secured by dpow to make it immutable and able to be verified from a single copy

[25-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If using it for nefarious purpose you would be bale to be identified as the creator

[25-Oct-18 11:35 AM] LocoMB#8593
so when streaming event is over, anyone interested can retain a copy, and if noone cares, it just fades

[25-Oct-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As the chain is owned entirely by your pub/private key

[25-Oct-18 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[25-Oct-18 11:35 AM] LocoMB#8593
sweet concept

[25-Oct-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It can be used for any data not just video

[25-Oct-18 11:36 AM] LocoMB#8593
💣 this is really exciting!

[25-Oct-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Any data you wanted to keep and verifiable copy of can be just streamed I to a chain and secured by dpow

[25-Oct-18 11:37 AM] LocoMB#8593

[25-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Its very important.. Not even looking to get paid here

[25-Oct-18 11:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its too important to not give away for free

[25-Oct-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although at first using it and dpow will have needs that can be charged for

[25-Oct-18 11:40 AM] LocoMB#8593
this sounds like it can replace all those IPFS apps that are in the pipeline right now

[25-Oct-18 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
