Prior to launching a smartchain, what software/hardware should one have in place? Hardware wallet, data server, offline linux laptop, anything else?

@MCB999 you need two nodes (it might be VPS, dedicated, laptops, virtual machines...)

Google trends for "OTC Crypto", which refers to the large transfers for trading $Crypto 'Over The Counter' has a lot of interest based in CA. i.e. Silicon Valley.

Maybe nothing, but this could be indicative of more startups/HF's looking to divert capital to Crypto or $BTC

Is there a calendar of Komodo (or asset chain) related events/meetups, etc?

[22-Aug-19 03:16 AM] MetaJames#2985
Interesting topic on crypto security I was wondering about, and maybe some of you also want answers to some of this... So... Do you guys think it's risky to stake multiple coins and download multiple core wallets on a single laptop? Does anyone else do this? What do you guys think are the chances of 'getting hacked one day' or getting attacked by a website or public wifi that was malicious? Could they steal your wallet.dat file and your seed with a keylogger? That's what it would take to jack a core wallet, both of those pieces of information. So, can a hacker ever do this to a fairly savvy crypto staker? It would be interesting to know what you guys think about this topic.

[22-Aug-19 03:43 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Staking using public WiFi? A hacker can walk by inserted usb drive and keylogger installed in less than few minutes.

[22-Aug-19 03:44 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Also the owner of the public WiFi can have access to information flowing through the network.

[22-Aug-19 03:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Installing multiple core wallets , if you are sure that all the core wallets are clean then it should be fine.

[22-Aug-19 03:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The main issue I think would be being on the same network and exploiting some remote access vulnerability .

[22-Aug-19 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
@MetaJames the more software you have on your laptop the higher the risk. Komodo does security checks of third party coins being added to dpow to prevent vulnerabilities. A keylogger can sit on your machine for months without being noticed. It's important that if you're staking coins, make sure the community is well known and there's credibility. However, it's difficult either way to find if there's a virus or keylogger hidden in a coin daemon.

true, I dont like them either, I think alot of xchanges are a waste, a few coins there another somewhere else, the market would work better when its more (i hate to say the word) centralized

[22-Aug-19 10:57 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
In addition to that: use dedicated hardware for staking multiple wallets (something like a piratechest will suffice). Do your everyday work on another system.

@Draeth some sell for example bitcoin coin with private key inside (like a gold bar)

[23-Aug-19 05:54 AM] Draeth#3300
Cool. I thought about doing private keys and stuff, but I don't like knowing that someone else (even if it's just me) other than the intended person has seen the key. I try to think of it as a customer buying from someone else

[23-Aug-19 05:56 AM] Slyris#2880

[23-Aug-19 05:57 AM] Slyris#2880
You can probably provide a solution that print a private key that no one see

[23-Aug-19 05:58 AM] Slyris#2880
Like you generate a private and public key, send coin to public key and in the shipping there is the coin and by mail or telegram or idk you receive your private key

[23-Aug-19 05:59 AM] Slyris#2880
I don't remember the company that give those coins but if I remember there was 5 bitcoin piece 1 bitcoin and 10 bitcoin

[23-Aug-19 06:00 AM] Slyris#2880
But the private key was engrave on the coin if I remember

[23-Aug-19 06:00 AM] Draeth#3300
Damn, that's risky

[23-Aug-19 06:00 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
The only way to do that is have the pre-order customers send in their Public key to be used on the coin. So @Draeth never sees the private key
