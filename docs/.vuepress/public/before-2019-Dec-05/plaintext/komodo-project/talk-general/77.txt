you don't need to run KMD to do anything with PIRATE chain. just build, then start PIRATE

[25-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Jmo#3577
I’m behind, what’s pirate?

PIRATE is z-KMD for the lazy & n00bs :trollface:

[25-Sep-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦 
errr no

[25-Sep-18 08:10 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok

[25-Sep-18 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that KMD uses z is not nearly the same thing as z-only

[25-Sep-18 08:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
we've already gone through how you can do exactly the same thing with z-KMD (if you wanted to), won't repeat

[25-Sep-18 08:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, but as Jl pointed out, it's not the same as there are very few z-tx's on KMD

[25-Sep-18 08:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
so if you were to analyze it, it makes it much easier to detect

[25-Sep-18 08:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn I missed that, please enlighten me on how you can make everyone use KMD z-only....

[25-Sep-18 08:12 PM] xRobeSx#5136
as there are few coins "missing" from transparent supply

[25-Sep-18 08:14 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Where do I put the command to run pirate

[25-Sep-18 08:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in the command prompt (terminal)

[25-Sep-18 08:14 PM] snowdamn#2414
you don't have to make everyone, if i want PIRATE-like privacy i only care to send z after doing t->z, z->z

[25-Sep-18 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you don't have to make everyone`
Therein lies the difference -- KMD = choice .... PIRATE = no choice

[25-Sep-18 08:15 PM] snowdamn#2414
it doesn't matter

[25-Sep-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
choice not equal no choice

[25-Sep-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it does matter

[25-Sep-18 08:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, words

[25-Sep-18 08:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
you can do exactly the same thing was my point, don't know what you're trying to prove

[25-Sep-18 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you can do exactly the same thing was my point`
And again, I ask:
please enlighten me on how you can make everyone use KMD z-only....

[25-Sep-18 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@snowdamn you are incorrect

[25-Sep-18 08:18 PM] snowdamn#2414
i don't have to

[25-Sep-18 08:19 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
It says it’s not recognized, and I was syncing to kmd just a minute ago so I have it

[25-Sep-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i don't have to`
Said every child that couldn't win an argument, ever

[25-Sep-18 08:20 PM] snowdamn#2414
i don't have to make everyone use z-KMD just because PIRATE forces it, Jesus

[25-Sep-18 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i don't have to make everyone is z-KMD just because PIRATE forces it`
You do when your claim is "exactly the same thing"

[25-Sep-18 08:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
i only have to make sure i don't break it when i want to attain same level of privacy

[25-Sep-18 08:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
it is the same thing if i don't break it

[25-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
no, the anon set in PIRATE is bigger than in KMD

[25-Sep-18 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant make something that is smaller bigger, just by saying you are being careful

[25-Sep-18 08:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
so then JUMBLR doesn't work either?

[25-Sep-18 08:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
guys, do your thing, but don't insult our intelligence here

[25-Sep-18 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's a reason JUMBLR has a minimum requirement

[25-Sep-18 08:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no matter how "careful" you are, if 5k "disappears" from t addys, then it's known that 5k moved

[25-Sep-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
JUMBLR is designed to maximize privacy give the t->z, z->z, z->t cycle

[25-Sep-18 08:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
i break it further, the 5k... or start with much higher amount

[25-Sep-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE there is never the ->t to correlate

[25-Sep-18 08:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
the ->t is only when need to exit, same as selling PIRATE for another crypto. my point is that it can be done, not sure what is controversial

[25-Sep-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no controversy. 7 million PIRATE in zaddrs from tens of thousands of transactions is more privacy than KMD or any other coin

[25-Sep-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE privacy is so good I predict it will be banned by govt from being on any large central exchange

[25-Sep-18 08:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
same is true for all other z coins, as you stated earlier...

[25-Sep-18 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know of any other coin that forces all to be zaddr (in the zcash family)

[25-Sep-18 08:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
they still won't list z-whatever, as you correctly presumed earlier

[25-Sep-18 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hence #deleted-channel

[25-Sep-18 08:49 PM] joe2x4#5987
The pirate onboarding "crew building" offer is like buying a treasure map. Maybe I'll bury my loot and leave clues for future generations like One Eyed Willy

[25-Sep-18 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`like One Eyed Willy`
Not sure where you are, but that means something totally different here

Hey all, I can’t put this in the announcement section and don’t know if its protocol in here to put these things here, but my name is Alvin Leito and I’m the founder of ViisiitCoin/Viisiit., which latter is a new door-to-door tech marketing- service provider, and the former is the utility token, where I want to do a private sale starting in week 45 for, that will be used to reward people we visit for their welcome, attention and/or participation (paid by advertisers, including Viisiit.), so in essence for example in the Netherlands, ViisiitCoin will be the first cryptocurrency that most people will just receive/hold for the first time, and it will be Viisiit.’s challenge to motivate/incentivize the people/mass to start using it, but that’s a challenge I’m gladly willing to take. 

So the interface/wallet/profile needs to be super easy, easier than opening an account on FB, but where people will get ViisiitCoins for the information they fill in their profiles.  

That was just so you guys can get an idea of what I want to do with Viisiit., and if anyone knows anyone/developers looking for a nice challenge (especially since I myself am not technical / don’t know most jargon, yet) in helping me either; make and/or maintain the assetchain on the Komodo network; make and/or maintain the software / platform of Viisiit., then please can you put us in contact with each other? And if its you, yourself, let’s have a chat then 😃

[25-Sep-18 10:55 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
FYI: on the frontpage of the website, I’ve put an announcement with an AirDrop challenge, which might be called a bounty challenge, but where the first ViisiitCoins by outsiders can be won

[25-Sep-18 10:56 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
@Deleted User I wish I could send you the logo right now, then you can see why 😉

[25-Sep-18 10:57 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
What’s your email?

[25-Sep-18 10:57 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
I’ll send you the logo on there 😉

[25-Sep-18 10:59 PM] AlvinLeito#0720
Aha, good one! About the #talk-other-topics, not imgur.. can’t be spreading that logo just yet, just wanted to send you it because you said intriguing

[26-Sep-18 12:00 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Hello mods, I was looking at the Reddit post concerning the submissions and feedback. I noticed a type, I think, since I was looking into the recommended fonts. Here's the post: ```Recommended fonts: Monseratt, Roboto, Open Sans, Helvetica, or Arial```

Is that Montseratt with the missing'T' or are we talking about a different font?

[26-Sep-18 12:00 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
I know it seems trivial, but I don't want to miss a single thing.

[26-Sep-18 12:01 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Thank you.

[26-Sep-18 12:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe ask at #komodo-team

[26-Sep-18 12:03 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734

Next thing you know the US is going to use pirate blockchain for how the people vote for the president

[26-Sep-18 03:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's better than the Electoral College 😣

[26-Sep-18 03:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ummm we must be reading different rules 🙄

[26-Sep-18 03:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Constitution does not require that Electors be completely free to act as they choose and therefore, political parties may extract pledges from electors to vote for the parties' nominees.`
Sounds "decentralized" to me 😛

[26-Sep-18 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To set the image of PIRATE so that professionals can expect to use it, I think it should have a neutral marketing material

[26-Sep-18 03:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from logo to presentation of it's marketing material

[26-Sep-18 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In case of PIRATE the marketing now becomes the most important aspect in my opinion

[26-Sep-18 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To NOT be treated it like a joke.

Things are heating up around kmd architecture..

"heating up" implies that it wasn't already hot 😕

[26-Sep-18 03:51 AM] jspook16#3059
Let me rephrase..I'm seeing kmd and related chains popping up outside of kmd circle

"To NOT be treated it like a joke." - if you're not a miner that knows how to cover his/her connection to the network and that will only SPEND the pirate, it is a joke. think of what it entails to get in/out of PIRATE and how easily the full anonymity breaks (i.e. when not spending but converting or when getting in without prior mixing) before arguing back, not trying to have to point out the obvious all day long like yesterday

🤣 heresy!

[26-Sep-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
@snowdamn we are making our own exchange that does zdeposit and zwithdraw for both KMD and PIRATE. getting out of PIRATE into zaddr of KMD leaks no info, not even to the exchange

[26-Sep-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you are making false assumptions

[26-Sep-18 07:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
you really want to do this? what if people send from t, who's hosting the exchange...

[26-Sep-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
only zdeposits

[26-Sep-18 07:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
so

[26-Sep-18 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so yes it can be seen who sent KMD in, but the end result is KMD in zaddr for PIRATE in zaddr

[26-Sep-18 07:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
i know all this, i'm saying something else

[26-Sep-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like you are claiming PIRATE anon is broken if it is exchanged

[26-Sep-18 07:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
no, was saying it is a joke because of all these issues

[26-Sep-18 07:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
you're creating false hopes for n00bs to think they'll magically become major hackers

[26-Sep-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
why a joke?
there have been many OTC deals for PIRATE. other than publicly announced timing of when the transaction took place, there seems to be no other way to identify where the PIRATE ends up

[26-Sep-18 07:49 AM] snowdamn#2414
meanwhile, we're back to hosting central exchanges, instamines, advocating people NOT use same features in Komodo

[26-Sep-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no instamine

[26-Sep-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this will increase KMD ztransactions by a large margin

[26-Sep-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
we encourage more KMD ztransactions

[26-Sep-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
who is advocating to not use these features in KMD
