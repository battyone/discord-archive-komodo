some confusion about DEX. some are expecting some major launch to happen in the next hours. it wont
we will start with a controlled beta
this gives us time to make sure it is as solid as it needs to be for a wider scale beta
after that, we will be able to know when we will be ready for a major launch
it is not as easy as you might think it is

Please excuse our ignorance @jl777c .  Ca333's announcement was not clear on what was meant by "public beta" and will be released "in the coming week".

[01-Jun-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@richardt the code is being released today, website later in the week. for now there are no instructions, only for the brave but anybody in the public can ask @SHossain to signup. he will get you the required directions

Hey all, I been reading about kmd and atomic swaps, and thought I may give it a try, but all the links on the Komodo homepage all seem to lead to an article and not an exchange. What am I missing?

[01-Jun-19 07:56 AM] ninjanoel#2096
ah. Ok

[01-Jun-19 07:59 AM] ninjanoel#2096
Ummm, I've held KMD since last year, was reading about it since before then, even saw claims contested when others said they've done the first atomic swaps. So this was claims about stuff done in development?

[01-Jun-19 08:05 AM] ninjanoel#2096
I've just Pre-registered for atomicDex on Google play store

[01-Jun-19 08:05 AM] ninjanoel#2096
Anything else I can do?

ah of course üòÑ   I mean there is a Bitcoin embassy in Atlanta with Jeffrey Tucker among its staff, he's one of my favourite libertarian writers and also very open about all cryptocurrency things, he's like a 'competition maximalist'. I believe he would be very interested in BarterDEX. Maybe meeting him in person and showing its use could be very helpful, especially if he writes about it later

Will the Dex still be called BarterDex?

[02-Jun-19 12:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Mobile is called Atomic DEX

[02-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
I liked BarterDex üòï

[02-Jun-19 12:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
I thought BarterDex development was discontinued

[02-Jun-19 04:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd say it completed to the extent I could, instead of discontinued.

[02-Jun-19 05:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It'd be anyway not useful, since it is only mm1 compatible and the system is upgrading to mm2. 
In that sense BarterDEX GUI is obsolete.

[02-Jun-19 05:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It had it's time. liked making it.

[02-Jun-19 09:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
BarterDEX lives on in all the GUIs that come after it, cant forget where we have come from

Hi all

[02-Jun-19 11:43 AM] gigosauras#5109
Is there any benefit to KMD coin holders from the DEX?

[02-Jun-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
default trading pair will be KMD

[02-Jun-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX revshares will be paid out in KMD, so must be converted from all the other coins into KMD

[02-Jun-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
goodwill

[02-Jun-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
increased visibility in other coin communities

[02-Jun-19 12:00 PM] gigosauras#5109
DEX revshares will be paid out to all KMD holders?

[02-Jun-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Paid out in KMD not to KMD holders

[02-Jun-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Meaning they would need to buy KMD in the open market

[02-Jun-19 12:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
same goes for crypto rewards etc

[02-Jun-19 12:04 PM] gigosauras#5109
Ok. Got it. Like for listing fees and all. Got it

[02-Jun-19 12:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
DEX charges fees on the native coin

[02-Jun-19 12:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Like say BTC/LTC i cant remember which one it takes but say there is a BTC fee collected

[02-Jun-19 12:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
the BTC will all be converted to KMD then paid out

[02-Jun-19 12:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So all trading fees collected in anything not KMD will need to be converted to BTC potentially then KMD

[02-Jun-19 12:05 PM] gigosauras#5109
Got it. üëçüèº

[02-Jun-19 12:06 PM] gigosauras#5109
