is wifi done via minipci?

[31-Oct-18 05:11 PM] 0x03#8822
you could plug in another card

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] 0x03#8822
for the trackpad, idk

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I hooked in lan cable to my laptop 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
problem solved.

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅

[31-Oct-18 05:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have bunch of 801.11ac WiFi dongles too. those works perfect too.

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
hm.

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but touchpad on librem is still crapy.

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only use it when I have to

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I use mouse instead with it. preferably.

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
liked seeing the system76 laptop

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those were smooth form touchpad

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
apple probably has the best trackpads/touchpads on the market

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] 0x03#8822
no wonder you wouldn't like the librem thing as much

[31-Oct-18 05:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and the crappy support for linux I guess

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] 0x03#8822
librem has crappy linux support?

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] 0x03#8822
oh?

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if my macbook pro could have installed linux with as equally working touchpad, I'd have washed osx on it and installed linux instead

[31-Oct-18 05:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's perfect hardware, and linux could have made it best.

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
macbook pro I say has crappy linux support

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] 0x03#8822
you had to try ubuntu, not feeling sorry that you didnt get it t run :troll:

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] 0x03#8822
no, i wonder that it didnt work out for you

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] 0x03#8822
sounds completely unexpected to me

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
librem has some OK level of hardware accessories in it. like said, wifi and trackpad.

[31-Oct-18 05:15 PM] 0x03#8822
i bet you had the right iso with the mac boot emulation stuff otherwise you wouldn't have got this far.... nonworking touchpad seems silly

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
suggest me any other linux which you think will do work with macbook pro touchpad as easy as it works with osx 🙂

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] 0x03#8822
easy. linux.

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
native install only.

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] 0x03#8822
choose 1 :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] 0x03#8822
have you tried debian?

[31-Oct-18 05:17 PM] 0x03#8822
theres a ton of docs for debian on macbooks

[31-Oct-18 05:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no haven't tried debian. once I moved to librem, didn't gave things much try on mac

[31-Oct-18 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😭 debian was my 1st choice for install on my new intel rig, but there's no NIC drivers working right

[31-Oct-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
for what NIC

[31-Oct-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
oO

[31-Oct-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
that would mean they've done something to the kernel?!

[31-Oct-18 05:18 PM] 0x03#8822
i know they patch kernels, but 'no nic driver' also sounds unexpected

[31-Oct-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
onboard "i219-V"

[31-Oct-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm guessing they did something new, because not 1 intel driver would install

[31-Oct-18 05:20 PM] 0x03#8822
wut

[31-Oct-18 05:20 PM] 0x03#8822
oh god, the download page for that lists a driver for freebsd tho

[31-Oct-18 05:20 PM] 0x03#8822
'gigabit base driver for freebsd'

[31-Oct-18 05:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
you know it's going to be a hard day when not even ethernet works in your kernel

[31-Oct-18 05:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
xubuntu 18.10 has the right driver but xfce sux with multi-monitors worse than most

[31-Oct-18 05:22 PM] 0x03#8822
if xubuntu has it

[31-Oct-18 05:22 PM] 0x03#8822
ubuntu should have it as well

[31-Oct-18 05:22 PM] 0x03#8822
not that you should use it

[31-Oct-18 05:22 PM] 0x03#8822
but...eh? that sounds strange

[31-Oct-18 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have seen some horror stories with new Intel MB's requiring updated linux kernel drivers just to make Ethernet work

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ubuntu didn't want to work with the GPUs, even with `nomodeset` (this has been a nightmare in every way 😝 )

{Reactions}
🍆 

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
you might need to `apt-get update; apt-get upgrade` to get those new drivers on your machine, they are not in the default install from iso

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto you can't update if you have no nic 😛

[31-Oct-18 05:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
get a USB LAN dongle and hook that to machine, install/upgrade system hoping the other drivers are installed too 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least raspberry Pi and other IoT devices made me buy all sorts of dongles and such.... 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:26 PM] 0x03#8822

it's a good thread to read. so shared it in general.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 usb wifi work? I have used that trick

[31-Oct-18 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
$10 usb3 wifi nano thingies can save a life

[31-Oct-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto I may have to try that (even if security weren't an issue, I hate this dam'd pre-1995 UI)

[31-Oct-18 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes older USB wifi sticks will have a better chance of working, brand new USB 802.11(n|ac) sometimes need drivers to work as well

this works out of the box for any linux

[31-Oct-18 05:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder no it don't 😹

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a bunch

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... worked for me on raspi and not remember what linux

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are MB's for which it requires non-default kernel drivers

[31-Oct-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
MSI and ASUS, you have to install custom drivers sometimes

[31-Oct-18 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`MSI and ASUS, you have to install custom drivers sometimes`
And they are really good about only supplying windows drivers with the CD they ship in spite of the fact that most people don't even own a cd drive in new PCs anymore 🤦

[31-Oct-18 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
yup. I have purchased that exact usb wifi adapter above. It works fine in rasppi's, but it won't work in a new MSI tomahawk B350 or Asus B450 without custom drivers

[31-Oct-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, @dukeleto @grewalsatinder thanks to the 2 of you, I may end up with debian after all 😎

no clue why I never thought of that, I have a couple of those out of some old bluray players

[31-Oct-18 06:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
@0x03 thanks for the privacy tip, how about for security?  if need for Agama

[31-Oct-18 06:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
same ?

[31-Oct-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
isn't there an Agama release build that runs on Ubuntu (the same as when they release for Win)?

[31-Oct-18 06:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, asking for tips on best GNU/Linux combo

[31-Oct-18 06:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
obviously, best is to go with strictly cli, but good for Agama users to play safe as well 😃

[31-Oct-18 06:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, I know for sure that debian 8.4-8.9 is a no-go for you if you want Agama and don't want to work for it :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 06:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, if i get an answer with a better setup than i have, i'll be working to change everything lol 😂

[31-Oct-18 06:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what I mean is that the libraries in those releases of debian are older, and getting the newer libraries to be static and not interfere with other things can be a pain

[31-Oct-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, off to see if I can dongle my way into a better OS

[31-Oct-18 06:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
18.04 LTS is probably good for your monitor setup, but not sure how it ranks for security

[31-Oct-18 07:12 PM] beybietron#2493
just reading on assetchains, would you know if it's possible to set the block time?

[31-Oct-18 07:16 PM] Hermes#6934
the blocktime ? you refer to the exact minute when a block is mined?

[31-Oct-18 07:25 PM] beybietron#2493
i may be speaking archaic terms here, sorry, i mean the interval of block generation

[31-Oct-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
no -ac parameter for changing blocktime

[31-Oct-18 07:27 PM] beybietron#2493
thanks

[31-Oct-18 07:29 PM] beybietron#2493
does this also mean that the rate of data searchable by the kv key-value search feature is limited to approx 1 minute? so if I insert data now, I would have to wait for the block time which I think is 1 minute before it is searchable?

[31-Oct-18 07:29 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[31-Oct-18 07:30 PM] jl777c#5810
with oracles CC you could search the mempool, i guess you can also do that with KV. I recommend using oracles CC for new dapps

[31-Oct-18 07:31 PM] beybietron#2493
Thanks, I don't know what that is. Care to share a link please?

[31-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry, no documentation on it yet

[31-Oct-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
other than Mastering CC
