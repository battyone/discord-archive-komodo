dPoW is described in Komodo whitepaper

[13-Oct-18 11:58 AM] crumb#2550
available on Komodo webpage

[13-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah whitepaper gives a very good explanation

[13-Oct-18 11:58 AM] twistedmind#1523
thank you

[13-Oct-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362

I just wanted to say @polycryptoblog has been instrumental in getting a lot of hashing pointed to arr along with promoting kmd.

[13-Oct-18 12:04 PM] twistedmind#1523
he has brought a lot of us w $$$ to the kmd table

[13-Oct-18 12:07 PM] twistedmind#1523
he is a good guy loyal to the kmd project

[13-Oct-18 12:08 PM] twistedmind#1523
that is why i have held kmd(a lot of kmd) and pointed my miners to arr

The guy attacking EMC2 claims that he may know a way to bypass dpow, are there known attack vectors?

[13-Oct-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
many, but none of them are useful for more than a couple blocks

[13-Oct-18 12:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@twistedmind  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-whitepaper.html  has our whitepaper in html format. Look at the section: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/whitepaper/section-1.html for a detailed explanation

Hi

[14-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Geocold51#6462
@Deleted User Not really a hacker. I'm just doing a proof of concept to show peopel how these attacks work and to have some fun. Not attacking any exchange or anything.

[14-Oct-18 01:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Geocold51 it sounded like you briefly described an attack against atomic swaps in your stream, using a 51% attack, would love to hear a description of it

[14-Oct-18 01:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Not really a hacker. `
Ya don't say? 🙄

[14-Oct-18 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User That was from his comment, not yours; I was meaning that any 2 minutes from his vid made it obvious that he wasn't one

[14-Oct-18 03:24 AM] Geocold51#6462

@Alright I wonder what bandwidth the chat chain could achieve?

[14-Oct-18 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that would make a usecase for the chatchain, just put webcam data into the opreturn 8kb at a time

[14-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Geocold51#6462

they already do text, with crazy fast blocktimes

[14-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how to render them

[14-Oct-18 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
We are reading from mempool. Blocktime is insignificant
