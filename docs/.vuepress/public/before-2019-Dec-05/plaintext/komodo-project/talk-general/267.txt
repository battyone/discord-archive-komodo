is there any plans to make KMD decentralized domain names like zil have done?

[15-Apr-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
no specific plans, but it wont be hard to do at all on the blockchain side

[15-Apr-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i think getting some official DNS registrar or whatever is needed is the hard part

[15-Apr-19 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
'decentralized domain name' is like an oxymoron

[15-Apr-19 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not if all nodes agree on the blockchain DNS algo that is decentralized

[15-Apr-19 06:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
might could work unless you need to change IP for whatever reason

[15-Apr-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555

to change ip, issue a changeip tx

anything that can be transactionalized maps pretty easily to CC

Probably could ahve run for 2 or maybe 3, and had a chance at that, but flat refused so that other can get a go.

I have been told by more than 1 peros@ It was refreshing to see projects like pirate and Zilla running for nodes.

[16-Apr-19 12:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think there will be a time where a person can only have a single node. When KMD hits $10, thats roughly $150,000 a year for a single node. Well and truely enough compensation to generate products for the ecosystem

[16-Apr-19 12:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Even more so at higher prices

[16-Apr-19 12:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think some companies like Indenodes and Chainmakers/ZILLA will probably be able to hold a few nodes just fine.
