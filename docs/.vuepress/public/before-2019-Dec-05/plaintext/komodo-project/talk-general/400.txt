Did I just swapped RICK for KMD? Yesss! 1:1? Yesss! Easy Atomic swaps are here for everyone, a truly decentralized way of trading, my keys my coins, never forget that!

Hy,I respect at the beginning cryptolark and he done in 2017 a good video about Komodo but now when you see him get involved to promote crazy project...he forgotten about decentralised ecosystem,I believe he talked with Ian balina been both of them promoting kucoin exchange,

just from one repo, i have thousands of commits

[22-Jul-19 06:08 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am..that's the 1st repo in the page..

[22-Jul-19 06:10 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
though while accounting for project data.. I won't track forked repo..as Github mix up data for forked repos..

[22-Jul-19 06:11 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
shady project forks tons of repos..

[22-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it be that for one year it has 3500 total commits for komodo, when i have done more than that in a few months?

[22-Jul-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
since komodo was forked from zcash, you dont count it??

[22-Jul-19 06:16 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
No..while calculating overall project data, I won't count forked repos

[22-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
since komodo is our main repo, that means your stats doesnt count our main repo

[22-Jul-19 06:17 PM] jl777c#5810
seems quite inaccurate

[22-Jul-19 06:17 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
<https://imgur.com/gallery/g3EOvDK>

[22-Jul-19 06:18 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok..let me change that

[22-Jul-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and do you count all branches or just master branch

[22-Jul-19 06:20 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
just master

[22-Jul-19 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
again not very accurate, as master branch is supposed to be stable and only updated on major releases or hardforking change or important bugfix

[22-Jul-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
we might go for a year without updating master branch, so it would look like there is no activity, while there are thousand of commits

[22-Jul-19 06:21 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
You won't commit on master branch regularly?

[22-Jul-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
no, that is bad practice

[22-Jul-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
exchanges update from master

[22-Jul-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
must be proven stable

[22-Jul-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so we start from individual branches -> FSM -> dev -> beta -> master

[22-Jul-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
beta -> master is more an annual thing

[22-Jul-19 06:23 PM] dan.#2473

[22-Jul-19 06:24 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
But they should use a tag or release ...master can have more commits than last release ..(I mean, yes..it has to stable) ..

[22-Jul-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
most exchanges just git pull to update or just git clone

[22-Jul-19 06:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Ok.. I will add more info slowly slowly..

[22-Jul-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, your stats is not counting our main repo and ignores 95% of the work being done in the repo you are ignoring

[22-Jul-19 06:26 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am changing that

[22-Jul-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i also recently created libnspv repo (a fork of libbtc) but it has a lot of new code and a working nSPV superlite client implementation

[22-Jul-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
about 300 commits over the weekend, or almost 10% of the total you list for a year for the entire komodo project

[22-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
9250 commits to komodo, net contribution of 250,000 lines of code

{Reactions}
ü§ì üòÑ 

[22-Jul-19 06:29 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Ok.. for now I am changing these 2 repos.. I will look into how I can accommodate forked repos..because Git api ..mix forked repo data.. example if `libbtc` has 30 contributors .. `libnspv` also show 30 contributors .. that's also not right

[22-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
likely i am one of the most prolific coders, that is invisible on your stats

[22-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
look at the net code contribution

[22-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
for contributors it shows a +lines and -lines

[22-Jul-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if someone just moves code around, it shows +1000, -1000 and looks like a lot of activity, but net change is 0

[22-Jul-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
looking at the komodo repo, my net contribution is more than all other devs combined, at least it looks that way and it includes the BTC and zcash devs

[22-Jul-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
in SuperNET repo, my net contribution is over 600,000 lines

[22-Jul-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so i am almost to a million lines of code in crypto

[22-Jul-19 06:32 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am changing komodo and libnspv ..repos status in my DB..they will be counted from next time

[22-Jul-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
do you look at the net contribution of lines ?

[22-Jul-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
curious to see the ranking of devs by that metric

[22-Jul-19 06:33 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am gonna add that stats this week

[22-Jul-19 06:33 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
thats based on number of contribution

[22-Jul-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
number of contribution is just one aspect, can be one submit of 1000 lines, or changing of a ; to a ,

[22-Jul-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the net lines / contributions shows the average amount of code per commit, mine is about 27 net lines contributed for 9250 commits

[22-Jul-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
for each of the 9250, on average i am adding 27 lines of code

[22-Jul-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
some coders might add an average of 500 per commit, but i have a more incremental style

[22-Jul-19 06:35 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Actually there no way to find a best dev...as in a BTC maintainer is the one who is pushing all the code in the master,..so his contribution will increase..so we can never find best dev...until we will see all type of different data and match code which getting pushing

[22-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, using such metrics is pretty arbitrary, but at least it should show the code contributions, which is the lines contributed minus the lines deleted. that will penalize a pure removing of old code with new code, but with crypto the old code usually stays around for backward compatibility

[22-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
by total commits, or net lines committed, i would imagine i would rank near the top, maybe more than many entire teams

[22-Jul-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
when your stats shows this, then it is starting to approach the reality

[22-Jul-19 06:38 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
üòÑ Cool.., I will slowly improve CoinCodeCap and add more metrics ..

Dear voters

Notary nodes Season 3 has just started, and I'm already preparing the 10% distribution of my KMD mining gains, as promised, which will be sent on august 15th or 16th (10 more percent will go to @mrlynch).

In the beginning of june, Agama has been hacked (see https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement), and therefore, some of your addresses has been compromised.

As I don't want to make the hacker richer than (s)he is, I checked explorer to find new addresses to send the rewards to.
Those addresses are the ones you told the Komomodo team to refund to.
(see https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident)

In the following message, you'll see in the first column the address you sent your VOTE2019 tokens from, and in the second one, the address I'll send the rewards to.
Feel free to DM before august 15th in case there's a problem with new addresses.

Thanks for your support!
