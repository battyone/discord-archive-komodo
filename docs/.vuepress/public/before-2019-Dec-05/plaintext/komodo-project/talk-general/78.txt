I admint a central exchange needs to be hosted

[26-Sep-18 07:50 AM] snowdamn#2414
i'm not posting to convince miners to continue going for 3 KMD blocks when they can go for 256 PIRATE. i'm posting for those that will allow themselves to see through the hype

[26-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD hashrate is up in the recent days

[26-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
to ATH levels

[26-Sep-18 07:51 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, the only positive thing is that n00bs will use PEX and increase z-KMD anon set, so that we do the same thing through Komodo lol

[26-Sep-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE only helps KMD privacy, seems to be bringing in attention to KMD from miners

[26-Sep-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE short of announcing that you just did a transaction, it will be difficult to even know if you did a transaction, let alone when. and even if you do, it wont leak info about the counterparty to the transaction. (unless it was a coinbase -> z). these z->z transactions just have no info to latch onto. even a noob wont be able to leak info (other than timing and txid)

[26-Sep-18 07:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, as i said, if one properly gets in and only SPENDS, fine

[26-Sep-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the leakage if one gets in improperly?

[26-Sep-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and how do you get in improperly? even with an announced purchase from a taddr, you end up with zfunds and at some later date is transferred and that transfer wont be able to be correlated, short of a public post of the details

[26-Sep-18 07:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
what is the leakage if i do t->z and then z->z?

[26-Sep-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, who can link the final z to the original t?

[26-Sep-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like you think there is a leakage and if so I want to fix it. i dont see the leakage of privacy

[26-Sep-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the z-> z breaks the links and most all PIRATE tx are z->z

[26-Sep-18 08:01 AM] snowdamn#2414
what is the leakage if i only spend to z?

[26-Sep-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
I mean how does anybody even know what txid the z-> z was?

[26-Sep-18 08:02 AM] snowdamn#2414
exactly, can do same thing, especially when n00bs use PEX!

[26-Sep-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you dont see an attack vector then

[26-Sep-18 08:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@snowdamn Reading your wrong claims ad nauseam reminds me of all the people that kept going on about how LN is part of Bitcoin 🤦

[26-Sep-18 08:04 AM] snowdamn#2414
wrong claims because you want the discussion only to revolve around the forced z, while not paying attention to what i'm saying?

[26-Sep-18 08:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`while not paying attention to what i'm saying?`
n00bs ...n00bs .n00bs ....n00bs ....n00bs ....Same thing with KMD ...n00bs ...n00bs .......Same thing with KMD ...n00bs ...n00bs ...
See, I paid attention. 🙂

[26-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
snowdamm. please describe coherently what you believe is a privacy leak

[26-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise I will just assume you are trolling for whatever reason

[26-Sep-18 08:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
go mine the 256 PIRATE instead of the 3 KMD, Genie! you have been running from what i'm actually saying all along

[26-Sep-18 08:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you have been running from what i'm actually saying all along`
Wrong again, I never run from emptiness

[26-Sep-18 08:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
i never said there is a privacy leak, i said it's a joke because you can do the same thing with z-KMD without central exchanges, pre-2015 instamine-like hype, etc.

[26-Sep-18 08:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
no leak if properly in/out

[26-Sep-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but noob have a big chance of messing that up

PIRATE is noob friendly

[26-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
just dont twitter your PIRATE txid and nobody will know

[26-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
making something noob friendly is difference between mass market and speciality market

[26-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
people keep telling me this

[26-Sep-18 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You can put a golf ball (private tx) into the 9th hole with your iPhone10 (KMD), that doesn't mean that using a club designed for putting (PIRATE) is the same thing as your phone

[26-Sep-18 08:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
@jl777c yes, i truly hope PEX becomes very popular and i will keep 3/256 in mind if i ever think of speculating! 😉

[26-Sep-18 08:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can drive around a race track (use private transactions) in a mazda 6 (any other coin with z transactions), but you're going to do a better job and have more fun in a lambo (PIRATE).

You can smoke cat litter (kmd) but it’ll be a hell of a lot funnier with meth (PIRATE)

Not that advertisement or pumping is KMD-esque, but KMD on coinbase would put it instantly on public radar. That’s all most of my non-tech friends use here in northern Cali. All I get is a “WTF” when I mention barderdex or KMD platform.
