Attention to voters for election 2018 that voted for me : As you may know, We were lucky, and we mined a large block very early.
I announced that I'd send rewards every 4 monthes, but the fact that this huge block "happened" made me reconsider my prediction : I was too stressed keeping funds that are not mine, and I decided to send the first part yesterday.
All voters (who voted for me ^^) should have received their part of the 30% mining, as promised. Thanks again for your support. Feel free to contact me if you want the tx details.
For information, I based the amount on yesterday's "Reward by Miner" from http://www.notarystats.info and made calculation with : 11639.42.
Next one will be in 4 monthes approx from now, but could be sooner if luck happens again.

It was an eventful launch week, but VRSC now is stable and past the critical initial blocks. It is to my knowledge the only CPU only mining coin out there now and already had thousands of miners. Not bad for being a week old. Anyway, I would like to welcome VRSC to the SuperNET portfolio and the KMD ecosystem. more info will be published by the VRSC team https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404

*Liquidatation & Migration time!!*

Remove your coins from the <#C8XRA5N00|tipbot>.  It is being migrated to a new server.

Go to <#C8XRA5N00|tipbot>
`kmdbot balance`
then decide what you want to do with your coins.

All care but no responsibility in the migration process.  Please please please remove your funds.

Now would be a good time to test out a Komodo Paper Wallet to withdraw to, or the Agama Web Wallet.
If you have 10KMD of tips and other things perhaps you could test out JUMBLR and let me know how you found using it.

Hi all! We now have all of our developer documentation available at https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ . The current github wikis at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki, https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki and https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/wiki, https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/wiki will continue to get updated and their updates incorporated into the readthedocs version. You are all welcome to visit https://komodo-platform.readthedocs.io/en/latest and go through the docs. If you find any formatting errors, typos or mistakes please inform me. I will make sure that both the github version and the readthedocs version get updated. Also welcome are suggestions about the titles of pages relative order of things inside the docs etc., If you feel like contributing to our documentation to create developer journeys or clearer explanations of things or docs explaining how some of the stuff fits together(Ex: starting from a user acquiring their first KMD -> safely manage it using agama -> use jumblr to anonymize their funds -> use barterDEX to buy other coins(This could be the first step when acquiring KMD)  ), you can fork the repo https://github.com/gcharang/KomodoPlatformdocs and submit PRs. If you have never used git, fear not! it's not really hard (I used it for the first time last month and am already half-decent at it üôÇ ).  Try: https://www.nearform.com/blog/first-time-with-open-source/ , to create readme files: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ git commands: https://git-scm.com/docs/giteveryday .

<@UATHJHYDP> <@UASCU3RK3> i want to be able to create an infographic that explains what hashrate is... using the river of electricity analogy and help people understand why bitcoin's hashrate is so secure and therefore why delayed proof of work is a huge thing for blockchain startups and businessess... so that we can help them understand how komodo gives them independence from building on same chain (like eth). I explained it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=365&v=_b-3PJjf9IE

ok. So the graphic will  not have to explain komodo just purely hashrate comparisons/?

[01-Jun-18 09:04 AM] jorden.oliwa#0000
I don't understand How delayed proof of work uses the BTC hashrate and interacts with it..

[01-Jun-18 09:08 AM] jorden.oliwa#0000
to visualize the river and stream, no problem. What is komodo in teh river analogy? Like a vacuum tube that runs above the river and plucks correct hashes or txn verifications out of the water?

[01-Jun-18 09:42 AM] jorden.oliwa#0000
or maybe it like a zip line... the komodo clips into the hash rate river and gets pulled along.

Hello :komodo_logo: nerds.  I am a new KMD pool operator and I want to donate our pool fee to the KMD dev team until July 31.  I think this will help them and also help our pool get a little visibility.  We are a super tiny pool at the moment, but hopefully we our donations help a little.  Can someone please direct me to the appropriate dev/marketing person who can tell me what address we should send our donations to, and any wording that you want on our pool site please?

[01-Jun-18 05:49 PM] ryan797#0000
I am not sure if there is an official pool.   We've been doing community raffles and giveaways for all the dICO's that have been dropping.  I am sure we could work a way to do a small marketing blitz for your pool.
