Hi guys

[25-Apr-19 12:46 AM] akiii#2220
I have a question can we store data in komodo blockchain ?

[25-Apr-19 12:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[25-Apr-19 12:50 AM] akiii#2220
@polycryptoblog how ?

[25-Apr-19 01:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
You can store public data in OP_RETURN or encrypted data in memo fields

[25-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Alright#0419
You can also create your own blockchain and anchor it to KMD via dpow. This would allow you to store significantly more data

[25-Apr-19 02:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
and with momom that data can affect stuff on other blockchains in a cluster

[25-Apr-19 06:51 AM] Exile13#4458
How hard would it be to make a bootstrap file for a random blockchain?

[25-Apr-19 06:52 AM] Exile13#4458

[25-Apr-19 07:12 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@CHMEX might know, he does bootstraps for all the assetchains

[25-Apr-19 07:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Blockchain seems to model the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

[25-Apr-19 07:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Consensus is decoherence

[25-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I have thought that before too, and it made me think: what if our universe is actually a blockchain in a higher universe üòÑ

[25-Apr-19 08:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Each year is a block

[25-Apr-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so "collapsing the wave function" is via "confirming the transaction" and schroedingers cat can be reorged?

[25-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
something like that

[25-Apr-19 08:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no nutellalicka, blocktime would have to be like, plankh time scale

[25-Apr-19 08:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
the apparent collapse of the wave function is the nodes coming to consensus on what is the "real" chain.  Without consensus acting as decoherence each block mined by a miner would effectively create their own chain.   Which would effectively be a Schrodinger's Cat situation.

[25-Apr-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so the cat can die, but then come back!

[25-Apr-19 08:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
only in the Komodo chat have I ever seen this idea come up, that ive thought of for years now.  clearly KMD is the greatest crypto üòÑ

[25-Apr-19 08:37 AM] Alexfrog#1338
someone double spent the cat!

[25-Apr-19 08:37 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was dead, but its alive again!

[25-Apr-19 08:38 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i wonder how long it takes to download the blockchain that contains our universe?   probably a long time.   bloats worse than Eth! üòÑ

[25-Apr-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the big bang was the creation of genesis block

[25-Apr-19 08:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
ü§£

[25-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the inflation happened when they added their premine

[25-Apr-19 08:42 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Reorgs would be like the situation found in back to the future pt2, where due to changing the past the future is different

[25-Apr-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
cooling due to halving of block reward

[25-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
clearly we need to add a tail emission!

[25-Apr-19 08:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The secret to syncing the universe is knowing the genesis block hash right?

[25-Apr-19 08:46 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Universe ATH was 1969

[25-Apr-19 08:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is alot of parallels that are freaky with how miners create blocks, how consensus happens, the effects of reorgs, the effects of an objective observer like notary nodes.    We laugh but it could be a usecase for blockchain that noone has considered yet, physics modeling.

[25-Apr-19 11:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
@Exile13 can you send me the github for the coin? I can see if it's easy to create a bootstrap

Would people be interested to have Komodo integrated with https://airgap.it ? It's an airgapped wallet that works similar to Ellipal but much cheaper

https://airgap.it
AirGap - Your old smartphone is your new 'hardware wallet'
With the AirGap two device approach secure key handling becomes more accessible. The AirGap Vault is installed on a dedicated or old smartphone that has no connection to any network, thus is air gapped. The AirGap Wallet is installed on a every-day smartphone.

@KomodoWorld yes yes yes that would be stupendous

@CHMEX you are awesome

[25-Apr-19 11:32 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'd love to have an easy airgapped solution

[25-Apr-19 11:32 AM] CHMEX#0686
@Mcrypt I believe you mentioned once airgap in the past

[25-Apr-19 11:32 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've tried the Ellipal wallet but it's a lot more costly

[25-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Exile13#4458
I was looking into modding old phones but that would save time

[25-Apr-19 11:34 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I had a long term plan of funding something like that, but they've already done the job

[25-Apr-19 11:35 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ideally there could be a specific Agama app to install on phone and use for airgap signing, if the whole procedure gets streamlined

if they use that someplace that will change to -ac_name=THC coinsupply

[25-Apr-19 01:44 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so the airgap integration could cost between 3.5 - 4.5 BTC,

we are getting close to sidechain test release, so when this is working you can do zaddr tx on KMD equivalent again. however, personally, I recommend PIRATE for privacy as without 100% private usages, the privacy can be pierced: https://cryptolux.org/images/d/d9/Zcash.pdf

[25-Apr-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
using the rewards you get from KMD to buy PIRATE is a decent hedging strategy and also gives you some coins that are totally private

Most people don't assign much value to free things, for whatever reason if it's free it doesn't seem as good as something that costs. Make launch fee $100 then offer a $100 rebate to the first 1000+ launches.

[25-Apr-19 05:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
A $100 value all for the price of free sounds better then free

You're right PTYX - I was talking in a more general sense when talking about dex vs cex and the listing costs.  

And my last sentance is conconfusing, I meant people tend to associate "free" with cheap or of a lesser quality.
