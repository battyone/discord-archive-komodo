[08-Nov-18 05:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's what it means, I'm pretty sure such tools will be used to take down the GitHub repositories for X reasons.

[08-Nov-18 05:02 PM] radix42#3743
Yeah it’s not looking good for DEXes in the US from a regulatory standpoint

[08-Nov-18 05:02 PM] radix42#3743
Oh I know

[08-Nov-18 05:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

good luck taking down Decentralised Exchanges.

[08-Nov-18 05:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just like they took down Torrents....

[08-Nov-18 05:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😂

[08-Nov-18 05:05 PM] radix42#3743
Well the etherdelta guy was in the US, so I guess I will NOT be pushing commits to a DEX anytime soon

[08-Nov-18 05:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
funny things to see in that tweet which refers to "Reddit" posts 😄

[08-Nov-18 05:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was said on X date of X stuff... blah blah...

@grewalsatinder  isn't hacking also coding and also illegal? some way lawmakers can link all kinds of coding to hacking and label and evil word on you

[08-Nov-18 05:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that sense human kind hacked fire too.

hacking means innovating something which wasn't supposed to be possible to do.

[08-Nov-18 05:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so all scientists are like hackers 😄

for simple politicians (read : stupid idiot) you are either criminal (they change definitions as they like) or good (if you support them and shittalk like all others)

[08-Nov-18 05:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
law making and rules creations - to enable more smart people there it must be moved online and totally split from country management

[08-Nov-18 05:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it will also be more optimize

[08-Nov-18 05:23 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
coudl be created in parallel by many different groups and voted by society

[08-Nov-18 05:24 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
like open source coding

[08-Nov-18 05:25 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
as for now not possible, so we push very limited minds to make law for us, cause it requires totally different skills to be politicians, for example being certain what to do even if you are stupid, or being loudest one, not truest one

[08-Nov-18 07:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
the only legal hacking now is the destruction of your privacy by a govt agency. Hi NSA! 😊

🤔  they really don't have anything else to do

[09-Nov-18 01:13 AM] PTYX#6840
Most likey the dexes that will survive will have to resemble bitorrent clients. no centralized downloads, websites, or servers that can be taken down.

[09-Nov-18 01:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
BarterDEX will survive ,  the reason being it is a protocol . An agreed upon standard of conduct.  ( atomic swap sequencing ) .  Those running market makers or those  building implementations of the protocol need to be concerned how they do things

[09-Nov-18 01:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
BarterDEX could be used in a centralized or decentralized fashion.

[09-Nov-18 01:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depending who is implementing it

[09-Nov-18 01:16 AM] PTYX#6840
LP nodes will become targets

[09-Nov-18 01:17 AM] PTYX#6840
but you can possibly get a license in some offshore jurisdiction

[09-Nov-18 01:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have been working on getting a kyc provider to work with Komodo in efforts to create a system where there could be verified addresses.  If a node could be configured to only conduct transactions with a certain list of pubkeys  that could make a centralized system

[09-Nov-18 01:22 AM] PTYX#6840
maybe dexes were never meant for high volume though. so you don't necessarily need an LP node if you have a good end-user app that let's anyone download and put-up a sell order that stays up until fullfiled.

[09-Nov-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just invalidate any pubkey not on the whitelist

[09-Nov-18 01:26 AM] 花果山#5224
Who is responsible for marketing promotion?

[09-Nov-18 01:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Exactly, that could make it so that centralized exchanges could be LP on BarterDEX

I just filled it out

[09-Nov-18 01:34 AM] PTYX#6840
KYC in barterdex is definitely doable

[09-Nov-18 01:34 AM] PTYX#6840
But then again, was that the point of barterdex?

[09-Nov-18 01:35 AM] PTYX#6840
I think it will be difficult to have it both ways.

[09-Nov-18 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Why will it be difficult both way? You could still deal with a nonkyc LP node

[09-Nov-18 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
P2p trading

One on one isn't forbidden, its barter

[09-Nov-18 01:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which has a legal and tax framework

[09-Nov-18 01:37 AM] PTYX#6840
What happens when they come after the developer for the non-KYC barterdex? Which is the main software.

[09-Nov-18 01:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pretty much everywhere

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They are the same protocol

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's open source

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] PTYX#6840
Is ether delta open source?

[09-Nov-18 01:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If someone wanted to edit theirs to trade nonpublic coins who is to stop them

[09-Nov-18 01:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Etherdelta controlled it's orderbooks it's marketmaking  used a centralized interface , with centralized development

👌 

[09-Nov-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
everything was run on a single centralized server

{Reactions}
😮 

[09-Nov-18 01:46 AM] PTYX#6840
I think it would be interesting to reach out to an ex-sec or sec consulting to see where barterdex and its infrastructure falls under current blanket regulations.

[09-Nov-18 01:47 AM] PTYX#6840
To see how it can be navigated being a developer, a trader, and a liquidity provider

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Interesting or perhaps terrifying

[09-Nov-18 01:48 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes, a little scary but it's better to know than to be unaware

[09-Nov-18 01:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
Etherdelta bro didnt even put up a fight. Dex’s are on the menu now.

[09-Nov-18 01:50 AM] PTYX#6840
The problem is that most dexes have used the word dex incorrectly

[09-Nov-18 01:50 AM] PTYX#6840
The only true dex I've seen working properly has been barterdex.

[09-Nov-18 01:51 AM] PTYX#6840
They call themselves dexes but operate and have the same infrastructure and interfaces as a centralized exchange

[09-Nov-18 01:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Also, as some erc20s become securities, ether delta officially becomes a security trading platform

[09-Nov-18 01:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
So when erc-20 etf? The sec is kind of doing the irs game where they recognize “it’s a thing, but it’s not, but dont do anything we dont like.... we’ll let you know if you do.”
