as opposed to the very real problem of ETH gas fees that prevents any massive usage of ETH

[05-Dec-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the more it is used, the more the gas costs go up for everyone, so massive usage is not a sustainable state for ETH

KMD had the KMDICE doing thousands of tx per block and no other chain even noticed

[05-Dec-18 03:44 PM] Captain_Jack#0015
agree and understand...and yes I am imagining problems...I try to look for patterns and problems and solve them in advance..the alternative is to stumble into them and have a crisis.  I'm not developing on ETH for this reason.

[05-Dec-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i suggest to set aside the 6000 KMD and not worry about dPoW for 20 to 30 years

[05-Dec-18 03:52 PM] Captain_Jack#0015

Hey all! We‚Äôve just launched a Komodo group on MintFlint. https://mintflint.me/KMD 

Komodo community members can launch Beacons and inform each other about the project. 

It‚Äôs a more decentralised approach to networking and information distribution. We‚Äôre still in beta and the community drive within the Komodo ecosystem initially inspired me to start working on MintFlint. 

It would be cool to get your views so we can create a better experience for the Komodo community.

nice @coinmonks ! That is an excellent article. I like how you actually launched an Assetchain.

that sounds interesting @mrdotboson 

I found the main website: https://www.mintflint.com/index.html

Can you tell more about that project? Is it something other crypto projects use? What kind of functionality does it have?

jl777 komodo repo itself, likely; all things komodo, more likely

[06-Dec-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I think 5000+ commits in the komodo repo alone, so maybe 15000 to 25000 overall

Below the links it does state:

[06-Dec-18 05:17 PM] oldskool47#4778
I saw that. But on Reddit they say to ensure your Agama is updated to the latest release.. I'm quite a few releases behind. Anyhow, moved my KMD to Ledger for now since Agama isn't updateable atm

@starcevic you are likely confusing "the last BTC ever created" with "the last BTC block mined". BTC will live on indefinitely. When the last BTC is mined, blocks will still be created, but the only incentivize for miners will be transaction fees.

1250000000 is hex 0x4A817C80, each bit takes 4 years to right shift. oh no! it is only about 31 halvings away
