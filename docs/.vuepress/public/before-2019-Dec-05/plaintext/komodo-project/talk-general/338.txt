i will announce later today the method that will be used for early redeems. in order to qualify for this, your address needs to be uncontested and in the swept funds, you need to have filled out the form, and you will need your old compromised privkey to prove you had control of the address. if all these conditions are met and it isnt for a very large amount (size yet to be determined) then I will aim to get them processed before June 15th.

from what i can tell, the vast majority fall into the above category. i will use the blockchain to prove that the repayment has been made. after this first phase of repayments, the number of claimants will be much reduced, but there will still be a lot of KMD left to payout. the second phase will deal with swept funds that are big, but are uncontested. so make sure to fill out your form ASAP.

the third phase will deal with funds that were stolen. at that point all that will be left are the disputed addresses, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

the sooner we can complete the refund process the better, so my goal is to complete all phases other than dispute resolutions by the end of this month, but with vast majority of cases before june 15th. thank you for your patience.

for a very large amount it will be claim earlier of 15th june or later?

i estimate between june 15th and june 30th, and depends on if it is disputed or not

let me just throw in: the same happened to IOTA - the very exact same thing, can't rememebr off the cuff when, 2 years ago or so
they swept vulnerable funds and redistirbuted them later

[07-Jun-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i am going as fast as possible but with all this money at risk, need to be very careful

[07-Jun-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
how long did it take IOTA to refund all the coins?

[07-Jun-19 06:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
quite some time, don't know right now defo longer than 3 weeks

If I filled form twice because the first refund address I submitted is potentially corrupted , I m in ¬´¬†contested case¬†¬ª ?

[07-Jun-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
for people who filled out multiple times, we will use the most recent one

[07-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Youplab#8793
Ok thanks for the answer

[07-Jun-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure you have filled the proper destination address in the most recent one.

~7% supply

[07-Jun-19 07:09 AM] DLT Novice#2835
Ok.  So is it correct to  say only 7% had logged in over  4 months or  is there another reason the amount is so low

[07-Jun-19 07:09 AM] Ludom#5832
Lot of people don't use Agama

[07-Jun-19 07:11 AM] DLT Novice#2835
So all agama use over about 4 months had seeds logged and stored  somewhere open?

[07-Jun-19 07:13 AM] DLT Novice#2835
So Is it correct you have a collection of seeds for all agama logins over the last 6 week's?

[07-Jun-19 07:14 AM] klein#5233
@jl777c maybe put that disclaimer on the claim form

[07-Jun-19 07:20 AM] Ludom#5832
@yorklab I was joking. Your reaction was good. It was an emergency situation

[07-Jun-19 07:20 AM] ninjanoel#2096
So I've a question about the hack, I understand that the seeds were being sent too a remote location, but when the security team "used the hack" to preemptively sweep wallets, they could only mean they used the seeds stored at the remote location. So our hacker was smart enough to steal seeds but not smart enough to make his remote store not publicly accessible?

[07-Jun-19 07:21 AM] ninjanoel#2096
Cause they wouldn't be able to "use the hack" to re-intercept all seeds?

[07-Jun-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that gives him cover when he is found accessing that location, he can say he randomly stumbled into it

[07-Jun-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the location has been disabled by the destination site

[07-Jun-19 07:21 AM] ninjanoel#2096
So it was publicly accessible?

[07-Jun-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
@DLT Novice we dont know what percentage we were able to get

[07-Jun-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
@ninjanoel theoretically, we had to decipher his obsfucated exploit to figure out where it was

[07-Jun-19 07:23 AM] ninjanoel#2096
Ah, ok I get ya. Fair enough that makes sense üëç

[07-Jun-19 07:23 AM] ninjanoel#2096
Good job guys!

[07-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
essentially, we hacked the hacker, but he is very patient. he spent months acting as a normal contributor

[07-Jun-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and also didnt immediately cash in any large amounts, to prevent any chance of rollback

[07-Jun-19 07:24 AM] yorklab#7270
@Ludom I know. üòâ As soon as I sent it I realized no more rewards for a while. I sent all my other coins to the paper wallet.

[07-Jun-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i doubt many coin teams would have been able to achieve what our team did. for them, the story would be 8% of coin supply stolen

[07-Jun-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a horrible situation, with much stress, but we can only do the best we can to get things back to normal as soon as possible

What priority the Security Team had when saving the funds? Because there were funds <50 KMD saved at 8 Am, large amounts >30k have not been saved till 1 Pm and because of this got lost. üòî

[07-Jun-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we prioritized by size, most certainly. as i said, we did not get 100% of the data

so we have no way to sweep. this is the outcome some people seem to be advocating as they complain at the sweeping, but i imagine for those who had funds stolen it feels much worse than being swept

i will announce later today the method that will be used for early redeems. in order to qualify for this, your address needs to be uncontested and in the swept funds, you need to have filled out the form, and you will need your old compromised privkey to prove you had control of the address. if all these conditions are met and it isnt for a very large amount (size yet to be determined) then I will aim to get them processed before June 15th.

from what i can tell, the vast majority fall into the above category. i will use the blockchain to prove that the repayment has been made. after this first phase of repayments, the number of claimants will be much reduced, but there will still be a lot of KMD left to payout. the second phase will deal with swept funds that are big, but are uncontested. so make sure to fill out your form ASAP.

the third phase will deal with funds that were stolen. at that point all that will be left are the disputed addresses, which will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

yes, the moment i saw all those privkeys accessible, even though it was an obscure site, it felt like the building was burning and we had to get everybody out. i didnt worry about damage to the doors as the entire building was about to burn. it turns out that the hacker had already started stealing some funds, but we havent had time to fully analyze the timeframe yet, so not really sure what was going on. it sure felt like we were in a race
