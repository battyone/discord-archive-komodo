`and I will say that I have been in Komodo for far longer than you`
stuff like that is where the drama starts
example:
my drama response would be...
"So feken what? How does that make you special? Saying that makes you an annoying prick"

And then the drama would ensue....

I posted this on Telegram a week ago so it will be a repeat for some though I added  a few things.

After one year of development Utrum has launched. Utrum had a dICO last year on the Komodo platform (Supernet is one of the largest investors). I encourage everyone here from the Komodo community to create an account and explore what Utrum has to offer. Utrum is a combination of CMC, Crunchbase, Steemit, Revain, Cindicator, Binance Research, Cryptomiso, Coinmarketcal and Medium all in one simple to use site.
You can post Reviews, Predictions, Insights, and Reports, all of which will earn you OOT when doing so. Don’t want to take the time to post? Then just vote on what others have posted and that also earns OOT. Virtually anybody involved in cryptocurrency will find some aspect of Utrum useful. That’s why I believe the potential here is so high.

It has been noted elsewhere that many are looking but few are signing up. This is a project where the community will determine its success. There are thousands of members here and supporting Utrum, as well as other projects launched on Komodo, will help to make Komodo a success. It would be a shame if a project this useful with this much potential isn’t even used by the Komodo community.

https://utrum.io/signup?ref=f7cb1597fd

…and if anyone cares, I am not a Utrum team member nor am I paid by Utrum. I just believe the success of the smart/side chains will help Komodo succeed.

Very rarely do large investors frequent discord channels and the normal channels associated with cryptocurrency and blockchain. Most of the fallouts, disputes and issues dont reach the outside world, yet. Most established fortune 500 brands have very few followers in the same channels we associate with successful projects in blockchain. Some of them have less than 300 followers on Twitter for example. The 'investors' as we like to label them, which are in fact non stakeholding contributors, are generally ruled by emotion inline with current price, which is actually not in anyway tied to financial performance.  The types of back and forth, outlandish and unsubstantiated claims and allegations, entitled views and opinions and general ranting, are not 'as' commonplace in more established industries. The individual attacks and personal insults are indicative of market maturity and the speculators it attracts. Big investors dont comb through discord channels, they look at key numbers that substantiate a logical return on investment. I think its fair to say not many take seriously anything that happens in any of these channels between unidentified members. The sentiment in these channels and comments made are possibly a good barometer for industry maturity and determining what type of people the current market attracts. We have a long way to go before mass adoption is reached based on the way people treat each other. At this stage the maturity of the industry is reflected in the arguments that reside in these channels.

@Machgielis Unlike more established industries, these channels are filled with a bunch of anonymous nerds, sitting in front of a computer with a lot of free time.  What do you expect? 😄

[06-Sep-19 01:04 PM] LocoMB#8593

It was a rhetorical question

[06-Sep-19 01:06 PM] richardt#2807
I think in more established industries (or the outside world, in general), there's a little more accountability with what one says or how one says it

[06-Sep-19 01:06 PM] richardt#2807
Not sure if accountability will ever be a thing in the crypto space

Tough question -  Imagine going from “Sunday dinner” with all your friends to watching them battle royal in a demolition derby until no one is left standing... because there is no past man standing in this.   Everyone suffers. 

People make mistakes and bad judgement, it’s human nature.  Maturity is the ability to pick oneself up, dust yourself off and realize the part played in it.  
I’ll read through and catch up while pondering it over the weekend.  
Thanks for your kind words.

@FishyGuts 
I think going to Sunday dinner with all of your friends, to watching them battle royale in a demolition derby, until no single one is left standing------is a good euphemism for life..

Every single developer worth his/her salt in crypto, has experienced something similar, and in some cases they might have been the catalyst.
But that to me, is seen as growth. Like you said, pick yourself up and look at what happened, acknowledge it or whatever u need to do to move on, and move on. Don't move out. You better not go anywhere.

You figure this out here, with Komodo Community and in the Ecosystem. And you continue doing good work. Then see how you really feel. You're appreciated here.

@Machgielis the key point with your POV is that many industries have processes and employee manuals with strict codes of conduct. These codes of conduct apply in everyday life too but when there is no manual and no enforcement of those manuals, some  people just stop applying basic relations conducts.

[06-Sep-19 08:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not implying we need a code of conduct, i think that is already a given without need of a paper. But there is people who just dont understand this and need the enforcement to behave. Sadly, it is the same dynamics of why many people think the state is a necessary instrument to force people to behave one way or another

[06-Sep-19 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But there is people who just dont understand this and need the enforcement to behave.`
Or the people that take issue with those people could just act like grown adults and practice personal restraint over themselves.
What if you didn't like someone, or found them offensive, saw their name next to a comment, and just simply didn't read that comment....

I notice that there were discussions about what and how to do it, why it does, it is not good, it is not accepted, we the community must stand aside to let the people from the komodo team, k64 and others involved to solve their problems, the purpose of the community is to support the project, give the idea, try to develop a buissnes where komodo can be implemented, we must become entrepreneurs, educators for those who will come in crypto, people have become nervous and the reason is the price, it has no relevance, most A good investment is what you do in training, educating yourself, we need to see as a whole how our lives will be changed and especially what our daily actions will be about the environment
