Methinks the "hints" are just @ca333's way of seeing how many people will try anything he says no matter how it seems to invalidate the last thing he said

@TonyL don't forget to report Agama bugs if you find any 😃

[01-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Decker#3767
I bet on "Encrypt Seed" with brain/heart as a PIN and using the created pin-file name as a seed. If it's true - it's over-not-obvious path to the solution.

@SHossain Oh I don't think it's a bug - I just made to many calls to API and it returned 500 on some point

its indeed a psychological experiment. the solution is the result of the hints. i see it in my brain but cant explain it since it goes beyond my verbal expression power.

`This is the golden key!`

you def. have not tried everything

[01-Feb-19 09:52 PM] TonyL#3577
@figgy132 I'm trying to find some logical way at the moment - hours of brutforce not helped as well

[01-Feb-19 09:52 PM] ca333#0118
the above steps are too complex

[01-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
you literally just have to solve the sudoku

[01-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
and then combine it with the brain of komodo

[01-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
last step is related to last hint

[01-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118

there is no matter how we enter seed - hidden or showed, so last hint is related to seed symbols.

[01-Feb-19 10:10 PM] Strob#3417
So "Solve the puzzle, then enter the answers in a wallet as a seed phrase.  Probably in order as they appear left to right, top to bottom." But an "OR" is missing... what does that mean? It could be right to left and bottom to top?

[01-Feb-19 10:10 PM] Decker#3767
left to right **OR** top to bottom

[01-Feb-19 10:11 PM] Decker#3767

"how did you provide your seed. Visible or hidden? It CAN make a big diff" - if we read it literally, i'm completely stuck. bcz no matter how we enter seed in agama - hidden or visible. it's a seed.

[01-Feb-19 10:18 PM] Gawain#7858
I know that one
