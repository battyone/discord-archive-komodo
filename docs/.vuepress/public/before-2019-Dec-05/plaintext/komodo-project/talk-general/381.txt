@CMA admin please post in trading, not general

[29-Jun-19 01:27 PM] plazma#1625
after the agama issue...i just uninstall the wallet....

[29-Jun-19 01:29 PM] plazma#1625
i don't want to download the whole blockchain again.....which wallet should i use so i can sync properly....

[29-Jun-19 01:31 PM] PTYX#6840
@plazma there's a few options for desktop. The Ocean QT wallet, Agama Verus Edition, Magnum Wallet, and Guarda Wallet

[29-Jun-19 01:34 PM] plazma#1625
should i use ocean qt wallet and try to sync with blockchain file or should i try that with agama verus edition.....

[29-Jun-19 01:37 PM] crumb#2550
you can try both and see which one you like more

[29-Jun-19 01:46 PM] plazma#1625
@crumb will Agama Verus Edition sync from begining or from my previous block in the old wallet.....

[29-Jun-19 01:47 PM] plazma#1625
bitcoin,zcash is simple just copy past blocks and chain state.....done......monero is a bit work but still works......

[29-Jun-19 02:02 PM] crumb#2550
all wallets share the same blockchain data. you don't have to re-download for OceanQT if you have already downloaded and synced with Verus Agama

[29-Jun-19 02:03 PM] crumb#2550
you can think of different wallets as just GUI skins

[29-Jun-19 02:04 PM] crumb#2550
all the relevant data is not associated with ANY wallet

[29-Jun-19 02:04 PM] crumb#2550
it's the blockchain, y'know

[29-Jun-19 02:05 PM] plazma#1625
ok gona try verus agama wallet....

[29-Jun-19 02:05 PM] plazma#1625

[29-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Torankoku#4818
it would be nice if the team can talk to the people over at Trust Wallet for them to add kmd to the list and implement reward system

[29-Jun-19 02:58 PM] PTYX#6840
@Torankoku no need to talk tot he trust wallet team. It's all available for other devs to come in and make their own implementation.

[29-Jun-19 02:58 PM] PTYX#6840
but there's already a few good mobile wallets including Chameleon Pay, Guarda, and Pungo. They all support rewards

[29-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Chameleon Pay is solid :ChainZillaCOINICON_Hyperdex:

is there any way to analyze the number of transactions over time on the kmd ledger?

[29-Jun-19 05:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes, the block explorer .  To get a picture of the whole ecosystem though you need the summation of all the chains tx

[29-Jun-19 05:36 PM] Torankoku#4818
yeah but that is not really convenient. no way to easily make charts from transaction numbers in block explorer

[29-Jun-19 05:43 PM] Oszy#5734
It has API, or at least some of them had before.

Why no marketcaps on dexstats?

[29-Jun-19 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
because you didn't code them and share the code

[29-Jun-19 10:56 PM] LooTz#2749
what is this etomic stuff ?

[29-Jun-19 10:57 PM] LooTz#2749
and vote2019

[29-Jun-19 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
etomic enables eth/erc20 atomic swaps
vote2019 is how NNs got voted in by KMD holders

[29-Jun-19 11:02 PM] LooTz#2749
any of them worth holding, are they still active ?

[29-Jun-19 11:02 PM] LooTz#2749
I got this bitch coin also

[29-Jun-19 11:03 PM] crumb#2550
you didn't vote in NN elections this year Lootz?

[29-Jun-19 11:03 PM] crumb#2550
if you did, you shouldn't have any vote2019 left

[29-Jun-19 11:03 PM] LooTz#2749
na, had more important things on my mind I guess

I literally have a coin called BiTCH

[29-Jun-19 11:08 PM] LooTz#2749

[29-Jun-19 11:08 PM] crumb#2550
BTCH was a merge fork for people holding Hush, Bitcoin and SuperNET

@LooTz welcome to the ecosystem, please purchase some PIRATE along the way :troll:

[29-Jun-19 11:10 PM] crumb#2550
or was it DEX instead of SuperNET, can't remember exactly anymore

[29-Jun-19 11:11 PM] crumb#2550

Hello guys

[30-Jun-19 07:27 AM] gobi#1545
anyone know the current status of supernet/hodl/kmd asset returns from the hack?

[30-Jun-19 07:28 AM] gobi#1545
actually, I'll ask in this in the support channel

[30-Jun-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i will process it today. make sure you have sent the dust from old address to new addrs

[30-Jun-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is all caught up

[30-Jun-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810

HODL and SUPERNET now in my destination address. Rest of my assets were small numbers and honestly I cbf filling outt he forms for them üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 11:03 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
my guess nSPV will be available for any KMD asset and same as coins wanting dPOW they could employ nSPV ?

[30-Jun-19 11:03 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Was there actually any issue with SPV confirmations already? longer response time or sth ?

[30-Jun-19 11:04 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or we have current problems solved, so now is time to solve the future ? :pirate:

[30-Jun-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
all headers need to be synced with SPV clients, with equihash that is 2kb per block -> 2GB for million blocks

[30-Jun-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it does require dPoW for the chain

[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] PTYX#6840
So a project has to be onboarded on dpow in order to qualify for nspv?

[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Oszy#5734
and has to have a kmd eco coin assigned to it

[30-Jun-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be dPoW and runtime fork

[30-Jun-19 02:23 PM] PTYX#6840
It's a cool idea but if we have had a hard time onboarding projects to dpow at a constant rate, we can expect the same for nspv.

[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] PTYX#6840
If a project is faced with the question of creating an app around nSPV or SPV, they will likely choose SPV since it's standarized and more widely used.

[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that assumes that nSPV doesnt increase the adoption rate

[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] PTYX#6840
does nSPV create any revenue for KMD?

[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it also wont work for external coins, even with dPoW, unless they make source level changes to support nSPV

[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV solves the massive scalability of userbase problem

[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if other projects dont want to solve it, we cant force them

[30-Jun-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
SPV takes a long time to sync headers and requires local storage of them

[30-Jun-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV allows for basically instant startup and gives nearly full node security

[30-Jun-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you can downplay its importance all you want, but the reality is that it solves one of the few unsolved problems remaining on the tech side

nSPV is not meant to increase the number of external chains onboarded to dPoW

{Reactions}
üëç 

[30-Jun-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it is to enable arbitrary userbase for any ecosystem project

[30-Jun-19 02:29 PM] PTYX#6840
So it's not meant to replace SPV in general

[30-Jun-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
as a side effect, it could create a meaningful increase in dPoW demand

[30-Jun-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it reduces sync data from 2GB+ to 20kb to onboard a new user

[30-Jun-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that is comparing to SPV
