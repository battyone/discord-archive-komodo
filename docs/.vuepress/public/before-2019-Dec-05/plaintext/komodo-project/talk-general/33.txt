Is it safe to store coins on hyper dex vs moving to a wallet since it would just sit on my PC.  Obviously the main issue with keeping coins on the exchange is the hacker issue.

Pretty diversified considering some of those top wallets are fund holders

[23-Jul-18 12:33 AM] ejuliano#8606
would be interesting to see a comparison of these charts for a bunch of different cryptos

[23-Jul-18 12:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  some of these top cryptos have huge amounts held in reserve by the main team

[23-Jul-18 12:55 AM] PTYX#6840
@JimD as long as you have the seed or the wallet file that the hyperdex generates you should be fine

it works very well as a lite wallet

[23-Jul-18 01:03 AM] Alright#0419
@JimD it's not "keeping coins on an exchange" in the normal sense. You own the private keys for the coins

Question for contemplation.
First we know that crypto is in its infancy still..  lets say 3% of population are into crypto or heard about it.
How many do truely care about decentralised online platforms, currencies..?
If 100% of population knows about cryptocurrencies and how it works and how to use it..
How many would care enough ?

@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies   Different people will care about different things for different reasons.  More so they will care if it affects them.

[23-Jul-18 06:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
For instance imagine not being able to get a bank account .  The inner workings of the blockchain have little relevance to a persons need to store wealth .

[23-Jul-18 08:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also anyone in australia know how komodos rewards are taxed? Is it just same as income tax (the case if it were interest) and comes under income tax bracket?

[23-Jul-18 08:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
We get 20,000 tax free so if thats the case id probably stick it on my tax return up to 20k a year so that I wont have to have a base cost of 0 for acquiring the asset when i sell :P

[23-Jul-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is an untested -donation=<pubkey> option that will send interest to the donation's address if you dont want to deal with having income into your wallet

[23-Jul-18 09:01 AM] ph03nix#3115

[23-Jul-18 09:56 AM] JvdP#8992
Me too, there's just too much downside potential with small-time tax evasion to save a couple of bucks...

[23-Jul-18 09:57 AM] JvdP#8992
Still, if you'd want to, you could just Jumblr the whole bunch. The problem is not making cryptos disappear (I expect another wave of "hacks" around Nov/Dec...), it's explaining where they came from when you suddenly have them again...

[23-Jul-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Competition... like lotto? Is that taxed?

What's the difference between Lightning Network and KMD?

[24-Jul-18 03:19 AM] Tort#9226
aside from the obvious (LN for BTC, KMD a separate coin)

[24-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Also Komodo has a bitcoin clone called Chips that will utilize LN

[24-Jul-18 05:13 AM] Spiderman#3141
who are Komodo's main competitors, if any?

[24-Jul-18 05:32 AM] Audo#5667
other platforms / technology providers ‚Äì¬†and we are thinking how to differentiate us from them as we are not a platform in the same sense as these other guys are.

[24-Jul-18 05:56 AM] criptobear#6402
would it be possible to create easy to remember KMD addresses for the wallets or to associate them to customizable strings, like they did with ethereum?

[24-Jul-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
identity is planned in project Veruscoin. it's 3rd party project based on Komodo assetchain.

[24-Jul-18 10:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm also looking forward to decentralised identity solution. can really use it in my project well. üôÇ

[24-Jul-18 10:39 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
decentralized identity is needed for decentralized voting, good someone working on it

[24-Jul-18 10:40 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and I hope it will work some way similar to google search engine meaning using some kind of links between identitied which makes ID stronger or weaker depending on linking id's wieght -> relevant to old page rank or sth

[24-Jul-18 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
d-identity will have a lot many usecases than we  can think of today. like bitcoin protocol has more usecases than just acting money.

[24-Jul-18 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think another project in our ecosystem working towards identity is hushlist... if I'm not mistaken somehow ü§î

[24-Jul-18 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto might know

[24-Jul-18 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am around if people have questions. HushList is still being developed and is compatible with KMD, KMD ac's and hopefully most ZEC forks unless bugs or missing features

@Spiderman  just in general platforms who provide projects/businesses a way to get started with blockchain tech.

The most established project would be of course Ethereum.

Zilliqa popped up with their focus on scalability: https://zilliqa.com/

Then Ontology sounds a bit like Komodo as they provide blockchains

> Ontology provides new high-performance public blockchains that include a series of complete distributed ledgers and smart contract systems.

> Ontology blockchain framework supports public blockchain systems and is able to customize different public blockchains for different applications.

There are quite a few platform focused projects out there, seems to have been a growing trend lately.

@sœÜldat, Yup, I got a new computer, a new TV, a Nintendo Switch (+games),  a bunch of streaming equipment (a nice microphone, webcam, headphones, and video capture device), and some random other stuff like tickets to MegaCon and the Chicago Blockchain Conference, character art, funny shaped dice, etc.. If you are interested, I play Pathfindner on two different YouTube channels. The larger of the two is (with almost 2k subscribers) Black Dragon Gaming (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrwvQV18rq-ImVL5879v8TA). The smaller of the two (with almost 300 subscribers) is The Inn of Planar Crossroads (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGyqVDJo-MCwiGLvNbxbO8w).
