[30-Oct-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not really, a lot of them are pool fees with amounts like 0.719999

[30-Oct-19 10:21 PM] Oszy#5734

@alexlibertas_ @KomodoPlatform @AtomicDex Some ppl seem to be confused:

12pm GMT is midday, not midnight! 
The comp starts at:

12:00 GMT // 13:00 UTC // 08:00 EST // 05:00 PST

So in a little over 4 hours 🎃 https://t.co/HQifcJPsAU

Can’t get Rick. Faucet says sent but it never shows in beta wallet have tried now several times with same result. Had no trouble with Morty but Rick just doesn’t seem to want to arrive.

[31-Oct-19 10:16 AM] alperC#7758
did you close the app and opened it again?

[31-Oct-19 11:06 AM] CryptoJesus#3041

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] gigamesh#3544
couldnt connect to KMD network

[31-Oct-19 11:10 AM] gigamesh#3544
i suspect the same might happen again when the comp ACTUALLY starts

[31-Oct-19 11:59 AM] Nagato 法#7244
So the stress test starts now?

[31-Oct-19 12:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[31-Oct-19 12:11 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
Do the swaps have to be exact matches?

[31-Oct-19 12:11 PM] saturday#4156
It's  too hard to match the swap.

[31-Oct-19 12:13 PM] mobipoi#5774
When do we start

[31-Oct-19 12:13 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
I mean can you get a partial fill?

New orders for each swap

[31-Oct-19 12:18 PM] Artist#0765
Is that ok?

[31-Oct-19 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Audo I guess it was intentional to commence atomicdex stress test on this special day:

[31-Oct-19 04:25 PM] farl#9964
@Umaru Please talk about the AtomicDEX stress test in #atomicdex-beta

[31-Oct-19 04:25 PM] Umaru#8531
ok

[31-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Solihin#4637
All order not be filled

[31-Oct-19 05:39 PM] Solihin#4637
Sad

[31-Oct-19 05:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a couple the past mins

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] gigamesh#3544
ok, it looks as if i have 0 after hours of trying. this is getting me down. speaking from pure selfishness all participants should get something out of this, or at least get 1 ticket. i have logs which demo hundreds of failed attempts over the course of hours. my mind is actually blown i have not landed one successful swap (ive used atomicDEX before with no issues)

[31-Oct-19 05:52 PM] gigamesh#3544
stick a fork in me

i wanted to post a gif of a grown man crying...

[31-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe the scriptspammers have turned them off near the end

[31-Oct-19 06:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lowering network traffic and infrastructure load?

[31-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Artist#0765
I got 27th man tried 100s of time any rewards for that

[31-Oct-19 06:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's over already?

[31-Oct-19 06:28 PM] dan.#2473
seems less swaps than mm1 tests

[31-Oct-19 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm1 tests were 24 hrs

21 swaps took the win? doesn't seem like much "stress" to me 😕

abusedsmily 

[31-Oct-19 06:31 PM] Artist#0765

[31-Oct-19 06:32 PM] Artist#0765
And tried like 100s

[31-Oct-19 06:35 PM] Artist#0765

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `Overall we saw about 120 Users using BarterDEX some for the first time.`

[31-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Artist#0765
On the leaderboards there were 70 or something

[31-Oct-19 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
would have been 1501-2001, had I know that it was only for like 5 minutes 😛

[31-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Artist#0765
I was 27th I guess

[31-Oct-19 06:40 PM] dan.#2473
1500-2000 ? I would think there would of been more discussion to reflect those numbers

[31-Oct-19 06:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Probably some scripts/bots spammed - it's rough numbers from simultaneous connections amount to the infra servers

[31-Oct-19 06:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
damn, I so wish I knew it was going to be that short
ChickenHawk would have dominated an easy 777 KMD

[31-Oct-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Unfortunately it wasn't that easy this time @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[31-Oct-19 06:45 PM] gigamesh#3544
reminded me of trying to buy a Binance IEO

[31-Oct-19 06:45 PM] gigamesh#3544
i jest

[31-Oct-19 06:45 PM] gigamesh#3544
but yeah , that was rough

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If ChickenHawk couldn't complete 150 swaps an hr, then it's all borked

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] gigamesh#3544
id like to know how many swaps in total went thru

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] gigamesh#3544
were there more than 1000 swaps

[31-Oct-19 06:46 PM] gigamesh#3544
500?

[31-Oct-19 06:47 PM] gigamesh#3544
most ppls got 0,1 or 2

[31-Oct-19 06:47 PM] gigamesh#3544
winner got 21?

[31-Oct-19 06:48 PM] gigamesh#3544
there was some talk about 1 of the seed nodes being down?

[31-Oct-19 06:49 PM] dan.#2473
were maker servers borked from the connections, or was there just a giant queue but it was working fine (albeit slow)
