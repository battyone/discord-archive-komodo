OK.  Thank you for clarification. 
One writes the block but the code requires 13 to agree?

[05-Mar-19 07:13 PM] Alright#0419
mining has nothing to do with it, a notarization is a transaction

[05-Mar-19 07:14 PM] Alright#0419
the notarization transactions have priority over any other transaction, but easy mining has very little(if not nothing at all) to do with dpow

[05-Mar-19 07:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ensures the chain that the 3rd party is notarizing to is secure despite lack of hashrate itself

[05-Mar-19 07:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That could be accomplished a variety of ways but in komodo serves the purpose of payment for services

[05-Mar-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
payment for services? who uses crypto for that? what do you think this is, a currency or something?

Thanks FishyGuts - so do notary nodes have a btc wallet with funds and ability to send a transaction to the bitcoin network? where do they get the btc is it entrusted to them from the KMD ICO supply?

[05-Mar-19 09:02 PM] LeshAft9#0083
just trying to understand ways in which KMD is not as decentralized as it could be. or is each notary node responsible to get its own BTC

[05-Mar-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the notary nodes are given the BTC needed to notarize from ICO funds

[05-Mar-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and yes, the notaries use a sortition process to multisign a proposed notarization to the network. then nodes that already had the same block mark it as notarized, so all nodes validate the proposed notarizations. powers of notary nodes are much less than for other consensus systems

[05-Mar-19 09:17 PM] LeshAft9#0083
so would the person holding and disbursing the BTC for notarizing be a single point of failure? is there a plan to transition to a more decentralized way that is indefinitely sustainable?

[05-Mar-19 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the ICO funds are in a multisig

[05-Mar-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually the funds will run out, so it isnt indefinitely sustainable as it stands. we will need to build up a large enough set of notarized chains and charge a small amount to cover the BTC funds. we have 10 years to do this, i think at that point it will be quite decentralized as the different chains would each be responsible for a fraction of the total needed

[05-Mar-19 10:34 PM] Alexfrog#1338
have the recent low btc fees helped makethe ICO funds last longer?

[05-Mar-19 10:34 PM] Alexfrog#1338
I would imagine that they wouldve run out fast in the late 2017 prices

[05-Mar-19 10:40 PM] Justaguy#6181
I'm messing around with my chain, and when I created it I didn't include -ac_public. Does this mean that the rpcuser and rpcpassword in the mychain.config file does nothing?

[05-Mar-19 10:42 PM] Justaguy#6181
like, if i wanna switch between wallets, what commands would do that? or furthermore, if i wanted to access my wallet on another computer?

[05-Mar-19 11:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Justaguy "No" and "only the computers with a given wallet.dat can see the addresses it contains". You can import the private key of any address to any number of nodes, and each node will be able to spend funds in it or "watch" it in read-only mode

[05-Mar-19 11:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
ac_public=1 means "no shielded transactions" and defaults to 0

[05-Mar-19 11:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Does this mean that the rpcuser and rpcpassword in the mychain.config file does nothing?`
Those are the credential settings (user/password pair) to send commands to the daemon (needed for `if i wanted to access my wallet on another computer?`)

[05-Mar-19 11:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if i wanna switch between wallets, what commands would do that?`
you'd add `-wallet=somenewwallet.dat` when you execute komodod

Hey all! With the Permission of jl777c, I am going to create a physical version of the Komodo coin, and I need the community's help in a few ways! First, I'd like to get some input on what you would like the coin to look like (gold, silver, with/without colors, etc). Second, i'll produce a preliminary design and you all can request changes to be made, etc. Once that's done, i'll send to the manufacturer to get digital proofs made and quotes. If everyone is good with how the digital proofs look, i'll start taking pre-orders (i need at least 20 to get the coin to be made, which will be posted on my website). If you want other changes after the digital proofs are in, i'll make them and send it back n repeat the process til everyone (or just about everyone) is satisfied. For reference, I made one for Piratechain, which is for sale on my website: https://physicalcryptocoins.com

[06-Mar-19 12:50 AM] Draeth#3300
current KMD price would put it about ~22.4 KMD

```There will be an extension to the anti-money laundering legislation for entities who hold, store and transfer virtual currencies; customer due diligence for cryptocurrencies is to be maintained however, these currencies will not hold legal tender status.```

I love the fearmongering phraseology that politicians across the globe share in attempting to get "normal citizens" to see things like this as a greater good:
```Criminal groups, including terrorists, operate across different Member States and their assets, including bank accounts, are usually located across the EU or even outside of it. They make use of modern technology that allows them to transfer money between several bank accounts and between different currencies in a matter of hours.```
