I do like me some nice cheese though, so get plenty of calcium

[14-Nov-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I like milk in my espresso, it makes it yummy

[14-Nov-19 01:12 PM] SHossain#0007

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 a cortado?

[14-Nov-19 01:13 PM] crumb#2550
well, it is a very general topic. so in that sense we are on topic :abusedsmily:

[14-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just wanted to get a conversation going to liven things up a bit

[14-Nov-19 01:14 PM] crumb#2550
i wouldn't worry too much

[14-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
talking about how rich we are getting in #talk-trading gets boring after a while

[14-Nov-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon not warmed, straight from the fridge to make it drinkable

[14-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha

[14-Nov-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
real humans cannot drink just made espresso 😛

[14-Nov-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3rd degree burns and all that

[14-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Depends if the cup itself was heated or not :p

[14-Nov-19 01:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
otherwise it loses heat rather quickly

[14-Nov-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
> loses heat rather quickly
buy better cups :troll:

[14-Nov-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for me a "regular" is 4 ounces 🤣

[14-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lool

[14-Nov-19 01:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Espresso is only a sip normally 😄

[14-Nov-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain maybe they have and decided to realize that human beings have organic conversations and that's what creates a community?

[14-Nov-19 01:21 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
`real humans cannot drink just made espresso `
just found out I'm no real human....

[14-Nov-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that or it's not real espresso 😛

[14-Nov-19 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The optimal temperature for espresso extraction is between 90 and 96°C (195/205°F).`

My coffee is just about strong enough if my spoon stands up-right, without adding sugar...

[14-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[14-Nov-19 01:23 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Even better if the spoon dissolves

[14-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And now it's only logical the advancements VRSC made again 😄

Fueled by pure caffeine

[14-Nov-19 01:24 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That makes me wonder how Mike drinks his coffee...

[14-Nov-19 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from a cup?

{Reactions}
🤣 

[14-Nov-19 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
intravenous drip right into the bloodstream?

[14-Nov-19 01:29 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I've considered that, but the downside is missing the exquisite taste.

[14-Nov-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_has spent a small fortune to get the "right" beans that he likes_

[14-Nov-19 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*and drank a lot of nasty coffee in the process

[14-Nov-19 01:32 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I know what that's like...

[14-Nov-19 01:33 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Downside is: if somebody offers me a cup of coffee, I usually decline. (Not stating to them that it's probably not up to my standards)

[14-Nov-19 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I refuse to drink ☕ at my mothers house and I told her that it's because "it tastes like shit" 🤣

[14-Nov-19 01:35 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
🤣

[14-Nov-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
she uses generic store-brand

>but you grew up on it
"Yes, but I did grow up"

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Try adding a pinch of caramelized sugar or melassis to your ground coffee... Some people hate it others like it. It enhances the coffee flavour.

[14-Nov-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my fingers are too big to fit inside the grinding cogs

[14-Nov-19 01:41 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Push harder and your fingers will get smaller

[14-Nov-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lol

[14-Nov-19 01:41 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
(Don't drink that coffee, though)

[14-Nov-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my coffee maker and espresso maker both have a grinder built in

[14-Nov-19 01:42 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Ah, I grind my coffee seperately.

[14-Nov-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I want coffee, not a 2nd job 😛

[14-Nov-19 01:43 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

[14-Nov-19 07:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
any idea on why kmd deposit is off in most exchanges?

[14-Nov-19 07:55 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I thought the problem from some days ago was already solved, some exchange that was working few days ago has also suspended deposits

[14-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Altsbit.io is open

[14-Nov-19 07:56 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes, I meant some high volume exchange. No offense

[14-Nov-19 07:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
as far as I see: Binance, Upbit, Coinbene and Coinex have KMD deposits suspended

[14-Nov-19 08:01 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I'm not sure why it was suspended and who is working on it, if somebody

[14-Nov-19 08:02 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

Info on atomic swaps leads to a 404 page.... dodgy af

[14-Nov-19 08:28 PM] phm87#7395

[14-Nov-19 10:40 PM] allbits#5898
They use ChangeNow for trades

[14-Nov-19 10:41 PM] allbits#5898
Nothing to do with actual atomic swaps

[14-Nov-19 10:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
i see, fees are higher than mm2 I would imagine

[14-Nov-19 11:06 PM] allbits#5898
Yes. Also selective kyc

[14-Nov-19 11:07 PM] allbits#5898
And you send your coins to them and hope/trust that you trade is completed.

cant work out which pairs are swapable

[14-Nov-19 11:23 PM] gigamesh#3544
``Use decentralized Atomic Swap to proceed with cross-chain exchange avoiding third party risks.

For coins not yet supported by Atomic Swap, we have built-in ShapeShift, ChangeNOW and Changelly exchanges.``

[14-Nov-19 11:31 PM] gigamesh#3544
which seems contradicted by their own FAQ

[14-Nov-19 11:31 PM] gigamesh#3544
`` All the exchanges within the wallet are processed by our exchange partners ChangeNow and Changelly. All the trading pairs available within Atomic Wallet are provided by our exchange partners. ``

[14-Nov-19 11:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
so not a dex?!

[14-Nov-19 11:35 PM] PTYX#6840
not fully but apparently they will integrate the kmd dex soon
