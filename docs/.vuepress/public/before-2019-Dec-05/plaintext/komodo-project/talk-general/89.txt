Sure sorry ^^ , "interest" was maybe easier to understand for someone not understanding UTXO. But indeed, "Reward"  is more accurate. (Reward to active user)

[04-Oct-18 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. in detail it is **Komodo Active User Reward**

How do you "claim" your reward? Also, isn't Komodo mineable?

[04-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Andr√©#2488
Sorry, also new here

[04-Oct-18 02:39 PM] crumb#2550
there is a claim reward button in Agama wallet. to get 5.1% APR you'll need to claim the rewards once a month

[04-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Andr√©#2488
Ah ok, can I store it on a Ledger nano s and still get the reward?

[04-Oct-18 02:41 PM] crumb#2550
ledger nano s reward claiming is tricky. there is a guide, but it's not really not that straightforward

[04-Oct-18 02:41 PM] crumb#2550
HyperDEX team is working on the more simple solution

[04-Oct-18 02:42 PM] crumb#2550

The liquidity problem is already being solved today by DEX aggregators like dexdexplatform (Dexdex) Easytrade.io that pools orders from multiple DEXs. According to the site:

‚ÄúDexdex searches multiple exchanges, protocols and market makers ensuring you always get the best available price. It also provides tools for anyone to generate their own liquidity.‚Äù

Hi, I watched the video about the 5.1% rewards for holding KMD in Agama. It suggests using the lite version. Is it possible to also claim the rewards if you use the native one?

[06-Oct-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can but the coins end up in change address, because hte Agama dev wont let you use -pubkey.

[06-Oct-18 08:29 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Thanks. What do you mean when you say "change address"?

[06-Oct-18 08:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have a physical wallet. with pockets.
got 100 note bill in 1
you buy/sell something. give that 100 bill to someone and get back 50, 20, 10 note bills.
this change doesn't go back to the same pocket you picked the 100 bill from. 
it always creates a new pocket, and puts these notes into it.
that new pocket creation is a "rule" in native mode only.
it is done by the native wallet, and not a human intervention.
this analogy should clear you what is change address.

[06-Oct-18 08:45 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK thanks for the explanation. Does it put all the KMD you have in a different pocket after claiming the reward, or just the rewards? 
Anyway, I think it doesn't make much difference if it's in a different pocket...as it's still inside my wallet.

[06-Oct-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it doesnt mean you lose anyting, but it makes it harder to track. Also for the election, if all your KMD is spread over hundresds of change address's its a huge problem to cast your vote.

[06-Oct-18 09:03 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Ah OK I understand now, thanks for helping

@D2D privacyalternatives.com you can also use native mode now. Native mode has an option to select address where the rewards will end up. Select the same address as you are claiming reward from

I also have another question.
If you want to create a token on the Komodo blockchain, do you have an easy to use interface to do it (similar to Waves platform)?

[06-Oct-18 11:21 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
not yet, asset CC is very recent development and there isn't a gui yet

[06-Oct-18 11:26 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK I understand . So there will probably be one in the future. 
Waves makes it very easy to create tokens, but they don't have some of the features that Komodo has which I think are important, like privacy and dpow

[06-Oct-18 07:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
Do i remember correctly that DPoW costs 300 KMD per year for any blockchain that wants to use that notarization?

[06-Oct-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
only for the past ones, prices going up

[06-Oct-18 08:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
Do you have a new price point in mind?  With a total supply 110 mil, 300 KMD wouldnt put much buy pressure on KMD even if literally every crypto project paid for DPoW.

[06-Oct-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_can't imagine that even with 5000 assetchains that 1500000 would put any pressure on the market spread over a year's time (4109.58904109589 per day)_

[06-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the benefit to KMD isnt from the direct transactional purchases

[06-Oct-18 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
think of what it would mean if hundred(s) of coins uses dPoW

[06-Oct-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a new business segment, blockchain to blockchain, with KMD becoming the leader of this new market

[06-Oct-18 08:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
So, computer, you are imagining a world in which crypto assets number 2.5 times what they do today and all of them use DPoW?  Quite the imagination you have.

[06-Oct-18 08:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am trying to think of what it would mean (on price action) of hundreds used DPoW at a price of 300 (or even a thousand) KMD annually and it doesnt seem like there would be much effect on price. Sure, the asset chains would be more secure, but it wont have an effect on KMD price.

[06-Oct-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
really?

[06-Oct-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
how much does marketing cost?

[06-Oct-18 08:27 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`So, computer, you are imagining a world in which crypto assets number 2.5 times what they do today and all of them use DPoW? Quite the imagination you have.`
I was agreeing with what you said and pointing out an exponential increase example

[06-Oct-18 08:32 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I would imagine most chains using DPoW would buy close to 7k KMD and let the yearly reward pay for the future use of DPoW.

[06-Oct-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
well 7 million KMD purchased by 1000 chains, would actually have a transactional effect

[06-Oct-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but the bigger effect from dPoW adoption by the industry is that KMD becomes an industry standard way for securing a chain. If the value of this in your mind is not a significant value, then it seems you not thinking long term enough

[06-Oct-18 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
industry standards tend to survive very long term

[06-Oct-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
now, look at PIRATE. the difference of PIRATE before and after dPoW. without it, it was an interesting test coin, but once it got it, then it becomes a viable contender in the privacy coin space. If the PIRATE chain is not secure, then it cant get a lot of interest.

[06-Oct-18 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
A lot of people are expecting a giant shakeout in the crypto space, and it is indeed a possible scenario where a lot of projects just dont survive in any meaningful way. how is an investor to be able to differentiate which ones? we assume they are not able to tell apart based on tech details since they dont really do much research, that's too hard to do

[06-Oct-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
now with the current level of "research" investors do, if they find out that many other coins are using KMD for dPoW security (whatever that is), it transforms KMD from one of many to one of the few that will be surviving whatever shakeout the altcoins will have

[06-Oct-18 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
THAT is worth far more than the 300 KMD per chain

[06-Oct-18 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but what do I know, I am just a simple C programmer

[06-Oct-18 08:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
Fair enough. So you see DPoW more as a way to offer unique value‚Äînot as something that will affect price.  Or at least not in the short or medium term.

[06-Oct-18 08:48 PM] meatspoon#7860

well requiring 100,000 to a few million KMD wont be hurting its price

[06-Oct-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but that is not the primary power of dPoW

[06-Oct-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto is very crowded. so crowded that even though KMD has solved many things, there are still startups that are raising millions to do what a single CC can do

[06-Oct-18 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
an already existing CC

[06-Oct-18 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
by getting many dPoW coins, we not only secure them, some percentage of people will dig a bit deeper
