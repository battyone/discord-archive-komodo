Looking for a developer (or potential partner) to develop smart contracts with Komodo. If you have prior experience with smart contracts with Ethereum/solidity that would be an advantage (yet not necessary). Understanding of scaling a must. Initial offer is for a short period (2 weeks), with potential long term contract > 2 years. We're a Dutch company, healthy and 8+ years in production (being a native Dutch speaker would be great, yet not mandatory). Our core team is 5 people, with a range of freelancers a grand total of 20. Oh, and we publish comics and games. DM me, if you feel you're up for the job with a short intro about you, your skills and what you have done with Komodo so far. ‚ù§

[05-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
looking at the website, I think that would be more fit for a future plan. At this point, I want to demonstrate / research potential for our VC partner; probably too mickey mouse level for you guys @jorian but I'll keep it in mind

[05-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Everyone on XMR I talk with is doomsday about the trusted setup.  

Yet, 2-3 forks per year to ‚Äúkeep asics‚Äù off the network is ok.  Pushing out forks early because of it is fine.   I mean why develop a coin for security and ease of use if you‚Äôve gotta continue forking in order to keep your GPU farms profitable. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

thanks @polycryptoblog so Sep 2018 - feb 2019 should be ~14500 notarizations and ~30 BTC

[05-Mar-19 05:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yep, about 1/4 of the total, for a quick approximate

[05-Mar-19 05:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Actually less sorry , 1/5.  , kmd has been around 5x as long

[05-Mar-19 05:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
6/76 = 30/x  x=380 ,  they would have spent 380 BTC and like ~30 million transactions if they were around as long as us ( even more factoring in high fee period )

Is the DPOW centralized? i.e. what is signing BTC transactions every 10 minutes

[05-Mar-19 06:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One of a random 64 Notary nodes that are elected.  8 ( I believe) Are automatically provided to developers to provide income and resources - 24 are Automatically renewed each year if they are top performing - 32 new ones are elected each election period annually, the next one hopefully being in April/May.

[05-Mar-19 06:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Notaries only additional authorities are to mine blocks at a lower difficulty so they can input the hash of KMD and it's asset chains onto BTC. 
They cannot change the blocks, add or remove transactions or censor anything that passes through.  
They simply have lower mining difficulties in order to facilitate the Hash Recording to BTC.  

As I understand it on a "simple" level.  
Hope that helps @LeshAft9
