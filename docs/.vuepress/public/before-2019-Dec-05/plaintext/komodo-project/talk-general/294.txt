[10-May-19 05:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
She never asked for money.

[10-May-19 05:18 PM] Steve Lee#1967
My guess is she went around promoting projects (first was stellar), and then getting retweets and followers from those communities, then moving onto another.

[10-May-19 05:19 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Think they legitimately liked komodo, and they were planning on launching a project with komodo.

[10-May-19 05:27 PM] az#1921
I think we exposed them early enough not to give them the opportunity to ask for money.  But we will never know

I don't expect them to be perfect. I expect them to listen if someone raise an issue. Which they did, just few minutes after I told them. And I'm sure they will double check next time.

Scammer - a person who commits fraud or participates in a dishonest scheme.
Fraud - wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain. 
Tell me what is my benefit in advertising a free Komodo? It's a benefit to Komodo, then, not me. Do you have any idea what you're wasting your time on?
Twitter account - Yes I use it from last year only. My name is Lydia. The rest of the data I think my private life. IBM - I work there. Not in Germany. It's my personal business again, don't you think? 
Which of you sitting here will give me your full details????? Or part of your real life?
 My attitude towards Komodo is true. I liked the technology. Project - true, I was going to do my project on this platform. Not sure now. Experience, knowledge of blockchain and programming is true. You can judge by my posts. Buy you some more popcorn? Or did I answer your questions?

[11-May-19 05:11 AM] tramp#0851
@az  learn to introduce yourself when you start a conversation. Politeness is also worth learning.

You're like kids. Another goal of mine was just to advertise you (because my project on your platform and I am ashamed to watch your advertising) will sorry, but your advertising and PR shit.

If somebody is claiming to be working from ibm and  really aint is that bad pr torwards komodo? Anyone can make twitter account etc. and play with those to gain personal benefits from markets.  If everything doesnt add up in research against claims, should team be cautioned torwards that person?

[11-May-19 05:36 AM] Mark81#4505
And someone can be doing troll messages even here in this chat. If not proven via core team members i would be really thinking someone doing imposter act.

[11-May-19 05:43 AM] tramp#0851
IBM is work. I've always stressed that everything I say on my behalf is not from IBM. If I was comparing komodo to IBM in some direction, it's because I know the company's policy.
