Is there an easy way to calculate total transactions to date?

[08-Sep-18 12:35 AM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 's abacus

[08-Sep-18 12:35 AM] Steve Lee#1967
Might be nice to do a metric based graphic on this accomplishment

[08-Sep-18 12:35 AM] Decker#3767
@Steve Lee As i remember total tx count exists in `debug.log` of komodod ... if i remember correct.

[08-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jspook16 I spilled a beer on it, all the abacus beads stick together now, unless you want to count in denominations of 100,000

[08-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But onward and upward

[08-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Steve Lee#1967
I thought it'd be higher than that

[08-Sep-18 12:37 AM] jspook16#3059
im guessing thats only transparent txs

[08-Sep-18 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
that is just for KMD

[08-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Steve Lee#1967
Yes that's true

[08-Sep-18 12:40 AM] Steve Lee#1967
What about total kmd in rewards paid out to date?

[08-Sep-18 12:41 AM] jspook16#3059
that would be good to know

[08-Sep-18 12:42 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
count up from 100M?

[08-Sep-18 12:42 AM] Steve Lee#1967
I'm thinking we do a Komodo "by the numbers" Graphic

[08-Sep-18 12:42 AM] SHossain#0007
Agama SPV mode also working for rewards claim

[08-Sep-18 12:42 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Not sure how that works why I'm asking

[08-Sep-18 12:43 AM] jspook16#3059
txs to date, rewards to date, jumblr txs to date (is this available?) and maybe  asset chains to date

[08-Sep-18 12:43 AM] Steve Lee#1967
1m blocks,  x TX,  x lines of code,  x commits,  x kmd in rewards paid out,  #7 in block chain activity,

[08-Sep-18 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards claimed would be current supply - 103 million

[08-Sep-18 12:43 AM] SHossain#0007
i mean that was before 1 m block

[08-Sep-18 12:44 AM] Steve Lee#1967

how do i get my coins from a failed mining pool

[08-Sep-18 12:53 AM] jspook16#3059
kmd?

[08-Sep-18 12:53 AM] jspook16#3059
sounds like something the pool would have to resolve

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You don‚Äôt own the privkeys, you‚Äôre SOL

[08-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are the pool owners reachable?

[08-Sep-18 01:13 AM] SHossain#0007
@1TheGhostProject which mining pool?

[08-Sep-18 01:41 AM] jspook16#3059
is it common to have an address show up in "listaddressroupings"  that doesnt belong to me (komodo in native mode)

[08-Sep-18 01:42 AM] bishop#9773
change?

[08-Sep-18 01:43 AM] jspook16#3059
that address has 22k KMD...i dont think its change

[08-Sep-18 01:43 AM] jspook16#3059
it doesnt show up in getbalance and i dont recognize it but its listed in listaddressgroupings

[08-Sep-18 01:44 AM] Decker#3767
may be it's watch only addresses ?

[08-Sep-18 01:45 AM] jspook16#3059
I'd like to get my paws on it though......how are watch addresses added

[08-Sep-18 01:45 AM] Decker#3767
may be it's after barterdex / hyperdex usage ?

[08-Sep-18 01:46 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah thats possible.........i've been using both on several machines....i lost track of what was traded where

[08-Sep-18 01:48 AM] Decker#3767
Did your watch-only addresses list have RNdqHx26GWy9bk8MtmH1UiXjQcXE4RKK2P ? If does - seems it's after *DEX usage.

[08-Sep-18 01:48 AM] jspook16#3059
yep thats the one

[08-Sep-18 01:49 AM] Decker#3767
I'm also have it on one of PCs ...

[08-Sep-18 01:49 AM] jspook16#3059
well i feel better now........i can destroy that wallet.dat file after i move my funds

[08-Sep-18 01:49 AM] jspook16#3059
thanks @Decker

[08-Sep-18 01:49 AM] jspook16#3059
I wish there was a tip bot here

[08-Sep-18 01:52 AM] Decker#3767
if you want to delete this watch-only address from your wallet (i looked - it's `BOTS_BONDADDRESS` from BarterDEX) - you don't need to move funds. Just use `dumpwallet` to dump all privkeys and addresses. Delete watch only from the export file. After - delete your wallet.dat, restart daemon, and use `importwallet` to import all of your privkeys in the wallet.

[08-Sep-18 01:53 AM] Decker#3767
All of these can took only 3-5 mins ...

[08-Sep-18 01:54 AM] jspook16#3059
ok thank you

[08-Sep-18 02:17 AM] ryman112#0068
Looking to buy a good pc for all my crypto and all my finances that is solid and secure.  Not rich obviously due to the current situation lol.  And go. Thanks for the input in advance.  Ps not a apple fan.  Please help

[08-Sep-18 02:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Build one?

[08-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I built one, so it‚Äôs not hard

[08-Sep-18 02:20 AM] jspook16#3059
asus Z170-AR, i3 cpu, 8gb RAM, SSD, ubuntu 16.04

[08-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Decker#3767
I think secure of crypto doesn't depend on PC's hardware. Mean, regardless of new or old PC you have - it's doesn't affect security.

[08-Sep-18 02:20 AM] jspook16#3059
not to heavy on your blockfolio and gets you walking around speeds

[08-Sep-18 02:22 AM] Decker#3767
But have a good PC like @jspook16 posted above - could make your work on it more comfortable. Also, if you have many native wallets running same time - good hardware is better.

[08-Sep-18 02:22 AM] ryman112#0068
I mean I want it to be solid.  No crashes or crazy knowledge of programming involved

[08-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ryman112#0068
I know anything can fail

[08-Sep-18 02:23 AM] ryman112#0068
Just suggestions.  Im not opposed to building one I am very mechanically inclined.  Software side im dumb

[08-Sep-18 02:24 AM] ryman112#0068
@jspook16 thanks for the input

[08-Sep-18 02:24 AM] jspook16#3059
what i posted is pretty solid. installing ubuntu is easy. gets you an easy user interface with the intimacy of linux whenever you choose to use the terminal more

[08-Sep-18 02:24 AM] Decker#3767
My current configuration is Core i7-6700k / 48 Gb DDR4 RAM / NVMe SSD / Ubuntu 16.04 ... it's enough for most purposes.

[08-Sep-18 02:25 AM] jspook16#3059
nice

[08-Sep-18 02:25 AM] jspook16#3059
i havent made the switch to NVMe yet....sata SSD still solid enough for me

[08-Sep-18 02:26 AM] ryman112#0068
My main goal is to have a separate computer for crypto(I do not mine by the way)  and have all my finances aligned on it that only I use.  I havea laptop now but its getting old
