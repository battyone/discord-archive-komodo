[13-Jul-18 10:18 PM] bogybogy#3962
I was surprised by the announcement of coinbase today,we can see the real   manipulation of the market, doesn't matter the technology is important who you know

[13-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Coinbase is a scamy firm

[13-Jul-18 10:19 PM] bogybogy#3962
..... unfortunately this is the way how they work

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I did be think coinbase is scammy they are laying the framework for all other CeX

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] bogybogy#3962
In the announcement they mention you can send or receive none of the coins

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] bogybogy#3962
Cex?

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Especially when dealing with US regulation which is by far the most comprehensive

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Central exchange

[13-Jul-18 10:20 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Dex = decentralized exchange

[13-Jul-18 10:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It's because stellar is similiar to ripple and they are adding the first true privacy crypto as well

[13-Jul-18 10:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Zcash... The government will not like that at all

[13-Jul-18 10:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Zk-snarks cryptos are money with a built in washing feature or fungibility. The government will see it as the former

[13-Jul-18 10:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I mean coinbase and gemini are PoS places to turn crypto into USD ACH transfers....

[13-Jul-18 10:23 PM] bogybogy#3962
But holding a decentralised project give you power to do what you like...

[13-Jul-18 10:23 PM] bogybogy#3962
Coinbase and gemini are hold by some venture capitalist

[13-Jul-18 10:24 PM] bogybogy#3962
This venture capitalist are involved in  over 30% of the crypto projects

[13-Jul-18 10:24 PM] bogybogy#3962
Soon or later will come some projects from china which they will hit hard the USA market

[13-Jul-18 10:25 PM] bogybogy#3962
In 6 months uk government will release them position for crypto and they are look very friendly

[13-Jul-18 10:26 PM] bogybogy#3962
The only thing what make me worried is IBM

[13-Jul-18 10:27 PM] bogybogy#3962
They got involved everywhere

[13-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We've done some internal research and the trend is that VCs and institutional money is where the majority of investments are  coming from in these past few months

[13-Jul-18 10:28 PM] bogybogy#3962
And why someone will use one of the projects decentralized

[13-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Steve Lee#1967
IBM's strategy is to get deeply entrenched everywhere, build service led practices, and become a trusted advisor in enterprise accounts

[13-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Steve Lee#1967
IBM sold off the majority of their HW businesses and is mostly services led

[13-Jul-18 10:29 PM] Steve Lee#1967
decoupling from their HW business allows them to invest and focus more on service led engagements

[13-Jul-18 10:30 PM] bogybogy#3962
Interesting approach by IBM in this case

[13-Jul-18 10:30 PM] Steve Lee#1967
rather smart

[13-Jul-18 10:30 PM] Steve Lee#1967
they're dominating SEO for blockchain

[13-Jul-18 10:30 PM] Steve Lee#1967
can't do a google search without them popping up

[13-Jul-18 10:30 PM] bogybogy#3962
But they are centralised

[13-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Steve Lee#1967
that's also the difficulty, we have a technology born from a certain ideology and then there's the fact that the technology itself needs to adapt for mainstream adoption

[13-Jul-18 10:32 PM] bogybogy#3962
The way I look this companys incorporated blockchain ,they reduce the cost for them but they charge the same price the customers

[13-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Steve Lee#1967
a full move to decentralization will take time, but will also be fueled by mainstream adoption and user demand

[13-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Steve Lee#1967
compromises will have to be made until we reach that utopian state where we can live in a fully decentralized world

[13-Jul-18 10:34 PM] Steve Lee#1967
I believe in decentralization from a philosophical view, but my career has been in enterprise, so i'm also grounded in the reality of how the technology adoption plays out

[13-Jul-18 10:35 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Komodo's new vision is to meet the needs of the enterprise market, while not discriminating the access to our technology and solutions.

[13-Jul-18 10:40 PM] bogybogy#3962
Nice words

[13-Jul-18 10:41 PM] bogybogy#3962
True,we try  live in utopia world but we can have only hope....at least the ideea is great and we know that Komodo build something better than others

[13-Jul-18 10:42 PM] bogybogy#3962
We will need another 3  to 5 years to see blockchain work

[13-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Steve Lee#1967
Yes - we're still far out.

[13-Jul-18 10:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I hope Komodo realistically captures 1-5% of the market. Jl's goal is 1% I think we can do much better than that.

[13-Jul-18 10:56 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats it.. gonna spend 1.15ETH to buy the remaining KMD i need to reach 500KMD.. nah!

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Tort#9226
worth it imo

[13-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Tort#9226
it's like 200 kmd to 1 eth or so

[13-Jul-18 11:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyone knows anything about rebranding that was planned to happen until EOY

[13-Jul-18 11:47 PM] Steve Lee#1967
We've just partnered with an agency and conducted our initial discovery meetings. We'll share details with the community once we develop the master charter and pull together the full plan and timeline.

@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies wish I got rich like that once ðŸ˜¦

[14-Jul-18 12:01 AM] Caglio#3337
Whats worse, I could have them, if I didnt bought @ 6.5$ per piece ðŸ˜„

[14-Jul-18 12:13 AM] bogybogy#3962
Maybe I'm the worst investorn in crypto from 2017 ....but ...for a reason I believe I'm lucky...I invest in Komodo last year and I get my 5 % monthly and in another's project from June 2017 and is same price))) today ...just they have been accepted by FCA authority in UK....so my psihic is trained to see this waves in crypto...but more importantly I  educated myself what means crypto....

[14-Jul-18 12:16 AM] bogybogy#3962
If we concentrate to the price will not help us....crypto give us a chance to get involved in project ...(wherever you can but you involved... marketing,promote to different channels the project, ..

[14-Jul-18 12:19 AM] Caglio#3337
What is a FCA authority in UK ? ðŸ˜„

[14-Jul-18 12:19 AM] bogybogy#3962
Financial conduct authority

[14-Jul-18 12:19 AM] Caglio#3337
Oh I see, interesting

[14-Jul-18 12:20 AM] bogybogy#3962
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is a financial regulatory body in the United Kingdom, but operates independently of the UK Government,

[14-Jul-18 12:21 AM] Caglio#3337
Well good luck sir, I think we all need it ðŸ˜ƒ

[14-Jul-18 12:22 AM] bogybogy#3962
Thanks ..if not just a bad investment..

[14-Jul-18 12:23 AM] bogybogy#3962
But not for komodo))

[14-Jul-18 12:25 AM] bogybogy#3962
...soon real good projects they find out they need to find a better blockchain than RC 20 they will move to komodo

[14-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Caglio#3337
Its what people are saying, but truth is different

[14-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Caglio#3337
Komodo is beating all those project for a quite some tome now already

[14-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Caglio#3337
stull nothing happens

[14-Jul-18 12:34 AM] bogybogy#3962
Wrong-komodo prove what they can do ...and is just the beginning...they will work more on this project....we can't compare Komodo with this silly ico on erc20 or elastos which make 100 milion dollars on ico and wants them people to promote the project for free...

[14-Jul-18 12:43 AM] bogybogy#3962
If the new people coming they will learn the basic staff about crypto they will not get in this traps of the crazy projects promising the moon-komodo should be like a Bible for them just to educate them self

[14-Jul-18 12:53 AM] bogybogy#3962
One thing I'm sure about crypto...this venture capitalist are the most greedy and they damage the crypto with them scams ico.end of story with them

[14-Jul-18 02:31 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Komodo is going to take time but it'll be worth it.

[14-Jul-18 02:32 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think or biggest catalyst will be simple contracts, we need to get those up and running so we can bring by more developers.

[14-Jul-18 06:20 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
@Caglio 500kmd is 750$ now.. not that unreachable. Had to sell my Ether for it and a little bit of bitcoin.
Holding this till mid 2020's or so ..

[14-Jul-18 06:21 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
KMD could be worth over 20$ one day... ðŸ¤ž

[14-Jul-18 07:48 AM] TheMaskedMan#6920
hehe

[14-Jul-18 08:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Jul-18 08:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In the meantime add some fresh fiat from time to timz

[14-Jul-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
crypto conditions is live in a komodo runtime fork (parallel chain) and new devs can start experimenting with simple contracts now
