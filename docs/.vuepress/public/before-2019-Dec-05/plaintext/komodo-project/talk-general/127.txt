[08-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Meyse#0952
i used to claim with agama all the time, in lite mode, to my same address. was just thinking if it couldnt be done easier

[08-Nov-18 03:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Meyse it's easier, but less safe

[08-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Meyse#0952
or does it create a new address and puts it under the same seed? now im confused

[08-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Meyse#0952
why is it not safe?

[08-Nov-18 03:30 PM] Meyse#0952
or less safe?

[08-Nov-18 03:30 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder it must be under 256kb 😛

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄 hehe... okay let me try again...

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
:smh:

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
lol

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Meyse because address has a send after the claim

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
lol

[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] Meyse#0952
what is unsafe about that?

[08-Nov-18 03:32 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Meyse unsafe when quantum cpus come out 😅

[08-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Meyse#0952
so Agama is unsafe when quantum cpus come out? 😛

@SHossain there you go 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:34 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Meyse since you asked, if you claim using native, the interest goes to new address, not same seed, need to keep wallet.dat safe

[08-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Meyse#0952
i just use a seed, im probably one of many

[08-Nov-18 03:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I once heard a phrase in Andreas's talk that, cryptocurrency will teach people how to manage `passwords` and be sensible enough to not create passwords like `123456` or `password` 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Meyse#0952
i care about usability, not extreme safety

[08-Nov-18 03:35 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, seed with SPV, sends to same address/seed

[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Nabob#5004
If you use seed on Spv, Rewards and amount move to same address

[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Meyse#0952
so @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and @snowdamn you are very extreme in this point of view i suppose?

[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
being a bank of your own, you'll learn about safety by experiencing.

[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
extreme paranoia, yes!

[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i care about usability, not extreme safety`
Said everyone until they get hacked the 1st time

[08-Nov-18 03:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those of us who have lost data for X reasons, we learned it the hard way.

[08-Nov-18 03:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Apparently, Money is data now.

[08-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Meyse#0952
but if you say these things, then why are there options for seeds? this makes no sense to me you are very extremely cautious. why not make everything mandatory native?

[08-Nov-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Meyse I lost 29k KMD last week to a worm infection; so, there's that....

[08-Nov-18 03:37 PM] Meyse#0952
this wont work will it?

[08-Nov-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why not make everything mandatory native?`
Because SPV has valid usecases, just not really good for "everything I own"

[08-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Meyse#0952
ah check, yes that might be a good point

[08-Nov-18 03:39 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Meyse options are good and so is our chat 🤓

[08-Nov-18 03:40 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-Nov-18 03:40 PM] wolfgang#3508
is there an issue with the chain?  I fired up desktop agama wallet after not opening it for 8weeks.

[08-Nov-18 03:40 PM] wolfgang#3508
keep getting RCP failure

[08-Nov-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@wolfgang do you have the latest agama?

[08-Nov-18 03:40 PM] wolfgang#3508
how recent is the latest?

[08-Nov-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less than 8 weeks 😛

[08-Nov-18 03:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
@wolfgang is komodo.conf still there?

[08-Nov-18 03:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
blockchain databases are kinda touchy feely. they can get corrupted for X reasons, based on the previous actions or new actions required to perform.
Try the help from #support and if nothing else works, may be try re-scan.

[08-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Meyse#0952
the regular "investor" probably aint a bagholder like you guys are. but if you are saying don't make using a seed as accessible and easy to use as possible i understand. but then again, imo this is neccessary for low entry barriers, to get users onboard.. difficult

[08-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Nabob#5004
@wolfgang  http://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/

[08-Nov-18 03:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't follow the convo. using "seed" is difficult?

[08-Nov-18 03:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what issue we are talking here?

[08-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Meyse#0952
no, but i want to make claiming rewards on mobile easy. and the counterpoint to that is that its unsafe

[08-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Meyse#0952
or im trying to figure out if people would want such an app

[08-Nov-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, that part was a good idea, it would basically be the same thing as SPV claim

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Meyse#0952
@snowdamn oh, then what were we talking about? 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
rewards is the MOST easiest feature I have ever seen in a cryptocurrency.
doesn't require me to keep open my wallet to either PoW miing or PoS staking.

The only condition is just spend the UTXO gaining rewards.

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
we continued talking about it after @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 said it was stupid

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
😂

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
how one does it and to what address one sends is their option.

[08-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Meyse#0952
it would be exactly the same as spv claim, just an app with 2 buttons -> claim rewards & set notification when best time is to claim

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
best time starts after 1 hour. 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Meyse#0952
depends on how much you have no?

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it takes a 10 KMD UTXO to start accruing in abotu 60 blocks of confirmation.

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
minimum UTXO size is 10 KMD.

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Meyse#0952
i know

[08-Nov-18 03:50 PM] Meyse#0952
but you lose the txcosts

[08-Nov-18 03:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for that you do the maths...... 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Meyse#0952
or let me rephrase that: button to set notification to claim in 1 month or whatever, so you dont miss the max amount of 5.1%

[08-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Meyse#0952
i was hoping other people would react to this idea instead of you guys haha

[08-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Meyse#0952
like "noobs" 😛

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
notifications.... good idea....

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Nabob#5004
We have that feature already on Agama, whenever you have rewards to claim, There is a notification " ! " on Claim button. It notifies user to claim

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd love that too....

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I didn't claim rewards for 2 months

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can feel ya mate

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php`
on 500 KMD you'd make 0.06 KMD more compounding daily rather than monthly

[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Nabob I guess he wants a system notification 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like wallet is closed but you still want notification

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Meyse#0952
notification on mobile

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like an alarm

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Meyse#0952
with just this purpose, holders of some coins that dont want to hastle with other things

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I should actually just setup a monthly calandar for it.... 😄

[08-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Nabob#5004
Too many  requests 😤

[08-Nov-18 03:56 PM] wolfgang#3508
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   damnm.... only 0,06kmd... not that much extra really

[08-Nov-18 03:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
better idea: find hooker to remind you, claim, pay her with interest :mindblown:

[08-Nov-18 03:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`holders of some coins that dont want to hastle with other things`
ffs, if sending 1 tx a month is a "hassle", then they should stick with fiat

[08-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Meyse#0952
you need to get your mind more to the average user instead of what you think of things

[08-Nov-18 03:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
OMG!! 0.06 * 7777 = 466.62 USD!
