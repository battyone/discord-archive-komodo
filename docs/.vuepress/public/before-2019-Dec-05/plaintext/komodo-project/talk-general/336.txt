that is the reality

[07-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Im sure there are plenty of better ways to scam than this

[07-Jun-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we are getting all the funds back to people, your math must be really weak to think we did this for a scam

@jl777c, might be what ever but I really didn't doubt it. Good Plan.

He made one good point though, he is more like the average person on the street and this stuff is  still too complicated for the average person.

Komodo for the most part is dev focused, and the new mobile Atomicdex should take care of easy to use wallet issue

[07-Jun-19 01:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I hope he realizes we could have been like other wallets that got hacked and told users to suck it up,  even his beloved easy to use bitcoin wallets have been hacked

[07-Jun-19 01:12 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
True

[07-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
How is what you did amateurism?

[07-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
You saved 8 million coins

[07-Jun-19 01:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Amateurism would have been pretending an issue didn’t exist ( Verge ) or ignoring direct warnings of vulns ( Zcash )

`and this stuff is still too complicated for the average person.`
If the "average person" in 2019 can't figure out that a feken eyeball with a slash through it hides the pw and no slash shows it, the future of the world is feken doomed!

He was just frustrated and hated that he had to go through a panic situation. Unfortunately many will associate an unsecure wallet with an unsecure blockchain.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  you read my mind

I have a feeling KMD will pump during this crisis haha

[07-Jun-19 01:19 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
I guess better no one can sell :p

[07-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Ye but I think a hard pump

[07-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
This pump we are having now is normal

[07-Jun-19 01:20 AM] yorklab#7270
I think the price is actually suppressed now. It looked like it was ready to take off just before this happened.

[07-Jun-19 01:21 AM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
True but I think it’s rebounding

If everyone gets their funds returned and Komodo comes out with a nice new (simple) wallet then most will be happy again. This will be (hopefully) a bump in the road.

If it was an inside job, wouldn't it make sense to introduce the vulnerability away from the prying eyes of NPM?

How did vulnerability get into the wallet at the first place.

[07-Jun-19 01:36 AM] PTYX#6840
if you read the article, the vulnerability was added upstream

funny, I've been using it all day and it's what powers 80% of the current hashrate 🤷🏽

You must have synced and been using from before.

[07-Jun-19 01:40 AM] kpprabhu#9635
Try syncing from scratch.

It's a total mess. And all the support docs only talk about Komodo.

@kpprabhu I added basic steps for chips to support docs this morning. Will update with screenshots when I get a chance, been a tiny bit busy over the last few days tho. 
Support docs are Komodo focussed in general, covering all ecosystem projects is a monumental task. It's kind of like expecting Eth to write docs for all ERC20 tokens, Or BTC to write docs for all coins that forked form their codebase.
