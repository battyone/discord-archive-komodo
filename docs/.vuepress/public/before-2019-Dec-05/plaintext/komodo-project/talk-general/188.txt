reinstalling Agama doesn't require you to backup anything. it is always better to keep a backup of wallet.dat and private key if you use native mode. if you use only lite mode, keep a backup of your seed only

Just saw the announcement about the partnership with CoinBene.  At first, I thought it was just some minor exchange but looked into it and it's actually quite a big exchange.  According to CMC, it's #2 for BTC market volume... this is some rather major news isn't it?  Congrats to the team!

People that don't understand what "marketing" is...

[31-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Ludom#5832
They spent so much for nothing

[31-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Ludom#5832
I just wanted to share this little article because Nem was launched at the same time as SuperNET project

[31-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Ludom#5832
" the foundation spent roughly 80 million XEM between December 2017 and January 2019, primarily on marketing. (Wong did not respond to requests for comment about the foundation’s spending.)"

“There’s not a whole lot of people working on this platform. Even though it’s easy, the community isn’t really there unless you go to Japan,” the developer said. “We need more developer traction on this platform.”

[31-Jan-19 02:21 PM] Ludom#5832
Fumble

[31-Jan-19 02:26 PM] Ludom#5832
My opinion is not to focus on intensive marketing, but building business and making our ecosystem grow. Attract devs to develop services based on our technology.

@Ludom what's happening in NEM is a good lesson to all of us.

Yop

[31-Jan-19 02:32 PM] PTYX#6840
Most projects are in the same boat but don't know it yet. Mismanagement and lack of oversight on expenditures.

[31-Jan-19 02:33 PM] PTYX#6840
The difference is that NEM has a council change and those new people found all the discrepancies by previous management.

[31-Jan-19 02:33 PM] Ludom#5832
That's why we should decentrlize our marketing

[31-Jan-19 02:34 PM] Ludom#5832
A single foundation is a single point of failure

[31-Jan-19 02:34 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't think the problem is the foundation.

[31-Jan-19 02:35 PM] PTYX#6840
The problem is the people running it

[31-Jan-19 02:35 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes but the risk of corruption and bad management is high

[31-Jan-19 02:35 PM] Ludom#5832
too much money

[31-Jan-19 02:35 PM] PTYX#6840
Definitely

[31-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Ludom#5832
I prefer that each business in the ecosystem works on the marketing from his point and with their resources

[31-Jan-19 02:37 PM] PTYX#6840
The foundation shouldnt have been spending on marketing

[31-Jan-19 02:38 PM] PTYX#6840
They should have funded the projects and then they would have to manage their own marketing budget.

[31-Jan-19 02:38 PM] jansako#3330
Agree, marketing the individual products that people build (their use-cases, really) is more cost-efficient...

[31-Jan-19 02:38 PM] PTYX#6840
I saw they spent half a million xem or usd on sponsoring the Lithuanian basketball team

[31-Jan-19 02:39 PM] jansako#3330
The platform/foundation is there to provide the common resources to these devs...

[31-Jan-19 02:39 PM] Ludom#5832
The foundation could be a tool to coordinate the marketing  of the parts of the ecosystem (if needed)

[31-Jan-19 02:39 PM] Ludom#5832
LOL about the basketball team

[31-Jan-19 02:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I would say the foundation should be a tool to prevent mismanagement of the funds used by the projects they fund.

[31-Jan-19 02:39 PM] jansako#3330
It helps smaller teams/startups to leverage existing messaging

[31-Jan-19 02:40 PM] PTYX#6840
But not necessarily manage a marketing budget themselves

[31-Jan-19 02:40 PM] Ludom#5832
+1

[31-Jan-19 02:40 PM] jansako#3330
It is OK for the foundation to market itself, the question is what are they marketing themselves as

[31-Jan-19 02:41 PM] jansako#3330
the platform should not be necessarily market/deliver services to the end user

[31-Jan-19 02:42 PM] jansako#3330
unless the end user is a consumer of the platform, of course

[31-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Daniel CP#2020

[31-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Ludom#5832

`Not once have you offered a reasonable criticism or actionable suggestion`
That sure reads like someone brought some feelz from some other topic....

[31-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Ludom#5832
To be honnest, I don't really take care on the marketing of Komodo. I can't say if it's good or not. I work on my side with the IndéNodes marketing found

[31-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Daniel CP#2020
To be clear, the marketing team welcomes all suggestions and feedback from any members of the community

[31-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Ludom#5832
I think I need to organize the third Komodo meetup

[31-Jan-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Daniel CP I'm not sure what "facts" relate criticism of the NEM foundation to KMD price
Was there some deleted comments that I missed?

It will be interesting to see how NEM solves the problem or even if they are able to get the community back on their side.

[31-Jan-19 03:04 PM] PTYX#6840
There seems to be riffs within the ranks as well which doesn't bode well but you never know. It does seem as though more of this will happen to other projects if it isn't happening already.

Every Komodo base projects should contribute to the marketing efforts, mentioning the community, the technology and all the great features that comes with it as often that possible

[31-Jan-19 03:57 PM] FabØ#8941
I need to state that lately @benohanlon is kind enough to spend some time to share tips and insights, which help our project but also improve our communication and promote the entire Komodo ecosystem

[31-Jan-19 04:02 PM] FabØ#8941
I do believe that if every project within the Komodo ecosystem use and promote Komodo microscripts - specific words and language determined with @benohanlon  we could accomplish a lot and also keep this Chinese wall btw the tech and the business side of things. IMO we need to protect the tech (Komodo) side by as little business involvement as possible and rare direct communication
