Just I find this comment:Here‚Äôs some interesting stats that aren‚Äôt spoken about enough in my opinion. As you already know, Cryptocurrencies derive most of their value through the network of users that are actively using them. The images here clearly show that Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate the active user base, while EOS and TRON dominate the total number of transactions on their Blockchain. The reason EOS and TRON have so many transactions, is due to the dApps that their community is using, especially the gaming dApps which require a large amount of transactions. However, one very important element that most people don‚Äôt consider, is the security of the Blockchain. This can roughly be measured by how much it would cost a hacker  in processing power to hack the network. In this case, Bitcoin outshines every other Blockchain out there with a cost roughly around $506,116 per hour. And this is exactly why Bitcoin is considered the digital gold of this space. The global reserve crypto must have an impenetrable network, so that people around the world have confidence that it will always maintain its store of value.

[04-May-19 06:02 PM] bogybogy#3962
They mentioned about Eos and Tron has many transactions through the dapps what community is using...where they got this dapps?

[04-May-19 06:03 PM] jorian#4555
you are in the KMD discord, maybe ask in their communities? how should we know

[04-May-19 06:05 PM] bogybogy#3962
The ideea is how they can lie so much and when I try to ask them community and compare with Komodo them followers start to be mad

G'day all, I am running for a spot in the Southern Hemisphere Notary Node elections and would love your support. If elected, I will be continuing to support the Komodo ecosystem through the creation of a development fund. This fund will be initially used to help create a GUI for CHIPS. Following that, any KMD ecosystem projects will be able to apply for fund usage. I hope this gives projects a small, but much needed boost when the time is right. 
I believe in KMD, and am here to help this ecosystem grow. Please read my proposal at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/notarynodes/nutellalicka/README.md

Trying to download the OceanQT wallet for windows

[06-May-19 09:13 PM] cryptojace#7102
I download the 7z file, when I click on it to start install a black box appears and then disappears very quickly and nothing happens

[06-May-19 09:13 PM] cryptojace#7102
Anyone know the reason for this? I am unable to start installation

[06-May-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
If your windows if not able to open the 7z, you can download and use 7zip (similar to WinRAR and WinZIP that can maybe also work) then extract files contained in the 7z

[06-May-19 09:34 PM] cryptojace#7102
@phm87 cheers for the reply. I am sure I have downloaded 7z files before but I will try downloading 7zip. I was just a bit concerned about the black box (kind of command box) appearing after clicking on the 7z file for a split second and then disappearing. Do you know what this may be?

[06-May-19 09:36 PM] phm87#7395
no sorry, maybe it checks the compressed archive and the check is very quick

[06-May-19 09:38 PM] phm87#7395
on windows if you are able to enter the 7z file/archive and see its content, you're good to just copy paste all files you see to extract them (paste them in another place on the computer). 7zip will allow you to do this (I'm not sure that windows handles 7z files)

[06-May-19 09:39 PM] cryptojace#7102
@phm87 ok cheers man

[07-May-19 01:03 PM] PTYX#6840
It's fairly new, I don't have many details. I assume they are using some type of profit sharing. So if they get an ad that pays a certain amount, they return that in btc. I could be wrong though.
