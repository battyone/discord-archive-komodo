Will verus agama automatically pick up my pirate that was connected to old agama if I'm logged into kmd

[05-Jun-19 10:34 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
If you've been using native mode kmd agama, native mode verus agama will show the same addresses.

[05-Jun-19 10:35 PM] jcooper#1100
@Potato Guy 9000 thx...I haven't used native mode kmd but use native pirate

[05-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Your best bet is to use lite mode verus wallet if you want to use agama. I made an address with zelcore to put on the form as my return address.

[05-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Make sure you write down your seed phrase and save your keys and all that.

[05-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Lite mode verus wallet makes entirely "fresh" keys.

[05-Jun-19 10:38 PM] jcooper#1100
@Potato Guy 9000 I'm using verus agama now. All my coins on other agama showed up. Just waiting for native pirate to dl

[05-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
If you have all your coins, you beat the game, boss.

@Potato Guy 9000 what's the link that shows all Komodo coins we own?

[05-Jun-19 10:40 PM] gcharang#6833
@jcooper simply importing old seed is not enough, you need to create new seed in verus agama and send all the differnt assets to it

[05-Jun-19 10:41 PM] jcooper#1100
@gcharang I don't know what this means

[05-Jun-19 10:41 PM] jcooper#1100
I just opened verus agama, input my wallet seed...stuff showed up

[05-Jun-19 10:42 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Yes  @gcharang you'll still need to move all your coins to an address that wasn't created by KMD agama

[05-Jun-19 10:42 PM] gcharang#6833
that old seed is still compromised @jcooper 
you have to create a new seed in Verus agama, then send from old address to new address
do it as early as possible please

[05-Jun-19 10:43 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I meant  @jcooper. Lol

[05-Jun-19 10:44 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes

[05-Jun-19 10:44 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
So iOS mobile Agama finished

[05-Jun-19 10:46 PM] jcooper#1100
Nope. Binance kmd suspended. Lol

[05-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I guess not then üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 10:47 PM] StrikerBurns#3846
I deposited mine to Binance unfortunately it‚Äôs on hold

[05-Jun-19 10:52 PM] jcooper#1100
My pirate.log on my Mac though is what my native mode pirate is connecting to tho right

[05-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
@jcooper I think your native mode pirate is ok. You said your installing the pirate branded ocean wallet?

[05-Jun-19 11:05 PM] Crazysoldier#9521
hey guys, how is my agama not secure anymore? was some seed leaked or was seed creation not as random as thought ? i think i imported the seed and did not created in agama so am i save or should i also move funds ( they are still here)
Version 0.3.4-beta (0.3.4)
as i have a lot of distributed backups around the world which are not as easy to access it would be very uncomfortable to change seed ...

[05-Jun-19 11:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
move funds

[05-Jun-19 11:08 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
@Crazysoldier move the funds if you can.

[05-Jun-19 11:08 PM] gcharang#6833
```
Simple instructions to secure your funds: 

0) Search your address in https://kmdexplorer.io , if the funds are there, follow the next steps exactly. If not, follow the next steps to create a new wallet in Verus Agama and use it to submit a claim as described in the following post, if the funds have been swept to our team's address: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

Please join our Discord server for real-time assistance: https://komodoplatform.com/discord

1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview 
2) It is safe
3) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
4) Note down the address
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
6) If you face "electrum error", "connection error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/

I know you guys consider VBK a shitcoin, but sheesh

[05-Jun-19 11:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Looks like we got someone here who can't read.

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's a wallet hack.

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] crunchycat#0726
Um, okay.  So why does the Veruscoin agama wallet I have say it's not affected?

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But you already knew that if you had half a brain cell and spent 30 seconds perusing the board.

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] crunchycat#0726
lmao spicy spicy

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It lacks that dependency.

[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] crunchycat#0726
sounds like somebody got rekt

[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Only you my friend.  You did buy into the VBK IEO right?

[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] crunchycat#0726
lol!!!  That was for non-US folk

[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] crunchycat#0726
I came out way ahead

I'm actually amazed KMD didn't dump after that

[05-Jun-19 11:16 PM] crunchycat#0726
still in progress or immune to dumpage?

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
when vbk open source?

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] crunchycat#0726
lol wen KMD take all your coin and make you ask for it?

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Before the hacker.

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Thankfully.

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
THey simply outhacked him

[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] crunchycat#0726
1 million got got?

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It seems like it was likely a hack race To save funds... We will wait for the team ann though.

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@crunchycat  what are you here for?

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
he is here to troll us

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
KMD outhacked the dude 8/1 or better.

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He is a poor troll.

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] crunchycat#0726
So, purely as an outsider looking in, I'd be greatly concerned if coin devs could just up and take everybody's coins

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] crunchycat#0726
but to each their own I guess

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Id be concerned if a hacker could to.

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] crunchycat#0726
peace out

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Im glad the dev team beat him too it.

[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But we understand logic fails you.

aw_yeah (2) 

[05-Jun-19 11:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
devs could only take the coins using the same exploit the hacker was using

[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Let's be clear about that.

[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] p.#1126
ohhh snap moron essay inc

[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] p.#1126
:3040_suspepe:

[05-Jun-19 11:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you wanted to do the same and had knowledge of the exploit, you could have done the same it seems. 
So in the essence of being faced with a choice....   Save 9 out of 10 puppies falling over a cliff or let someone keep pushing... Seems like an obvious choice.

[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] crunchycat#0726
hmmm, so open-source magic didn't save you...interesting.  to be clear, I'm all for open source.  But that was a main argument against VBK, that it would be susceptible to what just happened to KMD if no open source yet

[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It didnt happen to kmd.

[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
it happened to agama.

[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] crunchycat#0726
I think you're splitting hairs now

[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I wish you had the ability to read and comprehend.   Retyping this is annoying.

[05-Jun-19 11:23 PM] crunchycat#0726
and cheer up, lol

[05-Jun-19 11:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
No, you just want to point fingers at something it isnt

[05-Jun-19 11:23 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And still the KMD community embraces you.  

That's love.
