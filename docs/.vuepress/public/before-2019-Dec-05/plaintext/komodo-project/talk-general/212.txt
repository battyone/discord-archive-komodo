Fun fact, there is a lot of cross-border activity of in-app tokens for the major games taking place, driven by agents taking advantage of currency fluctuations. Wonder if using a "universal" crypto token could help mitigate that.

some sort of forex for ingame currencies will probably develop

Decentralized Games

[16-Feb-19 04:41 PM] matchacake#7139
NFT (non fungible tokens) for games would be super legit and the idea of having items in one game move into another would be really cool

[16-Feb-19 06:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
decentralized

[16-Feb-19 06:56 PM] richardt#2807
So decentralized gaming is the buzz now... are decentralized ICO's (dICO) still a thing?

[16-Feb-19 07:11 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Im not sure what are exact goals behind games, but it may be a game connected directly to economics (coins in the game) but also items you could purchase, all in synced system

one new benefit for having the rogue blockchained just was discovered. The top players can be found by scanning the blockchain and then the games of these top players can be extracted and studied by others to learn. It is basically open sourcing the gameplay for the top players and this seems a qualitatively different thing than centralized gaming. granted you can watch selected players play but you dont really know for sure who the best of the best are

yes - this will def. spread into unknown galaxies - once the gaming industry understands the impact of our gaming CCs we re going to see many high quality implementations.

I've been listening to talks on indie gaming for the last three days, now even more than before I feel Decentralized Gaming with blockchain features is going to *absolutely* flip the table on  the "Indie gaming VS. AAA Gaming" markets status quo.  

It will be opening new doors for the indie devs/studios that will give them numerous advantages on top of their current main advantage-  being able to create intimate cult like communities around their work. Crypto-Conditions gaming smart contracts are bringing two very strong ideas together for a multi-faceted, decentralized, *Beast of Disruption*.

Just writing some things^ Still working out wording/ideas a bit.

[17-Feb-19 06:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah the more I think about it, the more I'm starting to understand the implications. I have some friends in the industry. I've shilled them so hard on btc over the years I get the feeling once I bring this up they'll just tune out. Need a good use case.

[17-Feb-19 06:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Studios will be able to raise funds, hand out DLC + special items, create a studio based marketplace for game items AND have an in game currency all on one chain.

[17-Feb-19 06:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
and probably like 30 more things I havent thought of or exist yet

[17-Feb-19 06:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The verifiable game play is pretty cool too.  Certain players could even be given rewards based on their achievements

[17-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
This opens a ton of new gamification layers

[17-Feb-19 06:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
One thing for gamers is all the farming options it opens up.  You can farm characters that are tokens to sell through the marketplace/dex or anywhere else you can trade Game NFTs

[17-Feb-19 08:06 PM] richardt#2807
Perhaps some form of mobile game/DEX hybrid could be the killer app that blockchain tech is in need of

[17-Feb-19 08:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
James and I had this conversation in October about gamification being needed to induce useage when we were talking Pirate.    Unfortunately the Z transactions limit us in a lot of ways.  

So very cool to see the progress and what's been created.  Kick ass @jl777c , as always!

[17-Feb-19 08:12 PM] richardt#2807
The game doesn't even need to be anything complicated.  Anybody remember the mobile game "Flappy bird"?  A very simple and somewhat modern game that became super addictive

[17-Feb-19 08:20 PM] richardt#2807
haha, to each his own

[17-Feb-19 08:22 PM] richardt#2807
The creator of that game has a pretty big following on twitter.  He's been creating other indie games since.  Possibly a good person to reach out to if looking for game developers.  https://twitter.com/dongatory

I believe we can persuade gaming companies if we exhibit to them the cost savings benefit of mving on to a blockchain based database, rather than focusing on the games.

[17-Feb-19 09:10 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
sport cards that can be played even better

[17-Feb-19 09:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
But  JL basically  is going the route of , here game devs, put your game on its own blockchain and build features around it. Which is amazing.

[17-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes that too...

[17-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Deleted User  Gaming companies are all on the same playing field now for exploiting psychology and dopamine triggering tactics, blockchain can add new dimensions for gamification, which extends the amount of tactics that can be used

[17-Feb-19 09:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which we haven't really seen the full potential yet

Imagine unlocking a limited edition characters from one game and can be transfered to use in another games etc

[17-Feb-19 09:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm thinking long-term....that if what jl777c is planning to do....then I see all games will be free to download and play but would require a currency within the game to operate levels and weapons,etc

[17-Feb-19 09:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Just to clarify: Komodo isnt making games or becoming a games company
Komodo is creating a set of tools for studios and devs to build their games with blockchain on komodo

[17-Feb-19 09:17 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
and link that to real life activities like shoppings , etc , YUGE

I believe Jl777's intent is to make it as easy as possible for ANY game dev to add blockchain to their releases. I'm most hyped on the idea of studios making their games work with each other through the NFT's and giving them the ability to create their own marketplace.

[17-Feb-19 09:44 PM] richardt#2807

[17-Feb-19 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
My point is that Enjincoin has already penetrated that market and how does our KMD based games are unique from ETH based games besides the scalling. Do they have something like CC or is it just us?

[17-Feb-19 11:27 PM] crumb#2550
@Deleted User there is room on the market for more than one solution. don't dismiss the importance of scaling tho...
in 2017 whenever there was a big ERC20 token ICO the whole network crawled to a halt and fees went through the roof. also everybody remembers the CryptoKitties effect
it really is not a good idea to build something with certain expectations for price, throughput, etc and then suddenly discover that to keep using it you have no other option, but pay waaaayy more than you initially anticipated/calculated.

[17-Feb-19 11:28 PM] crumb#2550
