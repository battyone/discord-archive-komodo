Not sure how this passes the novelty aspect of patenting.   Proof of Work for network access isn‚Äôt new ,  maybe their exact method of doing so is patentable but i think this could be setting precedence for a vast overreach.

`Proof of Work for network access isn‚Äôt new `
Nope, in fact, their abstract defines a dozen things M$FT did 20 years ago (if you subtract the word "tree")

[17-May-19 03:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there's an interesting crypto conference in october in USA, called MassiveAdoption. I would be happy to fund participitaion and a speaking slot for someone from Komodo

[17-May-19 03:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Audo what do you think? I'm still enquiring about costs and more info

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] Audo#5667
yes that would be great @KomodoWorld . We are looking for opportunities for late 2019 as that's when the rebrand is finished and we have a lot more bandwidth

[17-May-19 03:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I thought the same

[17-May-19 03:11 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I will let you know, for now I'll tell the organizer you can possibily be a speaker

Looks like they‚Äôre tryjg to patent Merkle trees

[17-May-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
used in the context of preventing ddos attacks

[17-May-19 03:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is that conference charging the typical chucklehead rates of 4-5 figures/ticket?

[17-May-19 03:29 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
still waiting for details, I've been following the organizer for some time and he doesn't sound like the usual BS vendor

[17-May-19 03:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@KomodoWorld count me in if you wish.  I will try to participate üëç

[17-May-19 04:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Ok I got some info, this is a conference to onboard new people, most will have never used crypto before. The speaking slots are not fitting because it's not about a specific brand or project but more crypto in general, experiences with crypto, how people got in, etc... like TED talks.    But there are also a few demo slots where you can let attendees install and use a blockchain app. Perhaps this will be a chance to demo BarterDEX or Pangea Poker to a totally new audience.

[17-May-19 04:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
`deploying a working product to our audience: we're expecting 2000+ people, many of whom have never used crypto or blockchain products before. Attendees will be strongly incentivized to install our partners' products on their devices before the event and partners will have stage time with the audience during the event in order to engage with the product. This is a paid option and results in specific installs, DAUs and real user feedback at scale. We've got 8-10 slots here and 5 area already called for so let me know if this is something interesting to you`

[17-May-19 04:40 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there are many important speakers, so it will be interesting that they too see BarterDEX at work

[17-May-19 04:52 PM] FishyGuts#5085
When is this?  Yes barterdex would be awesome.  New attendees and signups can receive pizza and beer to trade with and practice with during a live demo

[17-May-19 04:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"Download BarterDEX app and get free pizza and beer!"

[17-May-19 04:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Either by scanning QR codes at the function/on the flyers, or faucets or possibly finding a way to automatically send new wallets made within a certain time frame pizza and beer automatically. ü§∑

It's in Memphis in late october

[17-May-19 05:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Money 20/20 is in Vegas OCT 29-30.   We have a spot there it seems.  Anyone willing to hit that up?

[17-May-19 05:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just sit a table out with the white banner and a cup of coffee...
`"Komodo is better than eth to build your blockchain.  Prove me wrong."`

Pizza and Beer trading comp during the conference.  Top traders get a KMD prize or something physical like a phone.

@mrlynch The conference is only half the day.  Plenty of time for debuachery.  @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ - I peg you as a craps guy.

[17-May-19 05:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
PS.. I would spend ALL my KMDICE on craps.

[17-May-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
craps and poker
I tend to lose the winnings of the latter on the former üò≠

[17-May-19 05:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
however to do such should best plan it out,  its always wise to go to an event with an agenda

[17-May-19 05:57 PM] mrlynch#5735
behind the trolling there is careful planning to some degree

[17-May-19 06:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@FishyGuts @Audo the conference is https://www.massiveadoption.com/ the website should be live at end of month. It's good that I contacted the organizer because there are only 3 spots left (out of 8) for the app demo, I'm waiting for a reply about cost, etc. Then I'll forward you the info

Face id is like keeps on recognising again and again

[18-May-19 12:23 PM] PTYX#6840
Face ID/Lock isn't fully implemented yet. We are getting mixed results from devices. For now use the password lock.

In regards to the crashes, please if you can send the error log (shows up after crash) and device info to hello@chainzilla.io

We been testing 2.2 for the past 2 weeks with 2 or 3 crashes to show.

if i have agama wallet and have coins there...if i install windows again, what should i have to backup to have the coins again after windows is new ? thanks

[18-May-19 02:59 PM] PTYX#6840
@Roxin did you use lite or native mode?

[18-May-19 02:59 PM] Roxin#4844
for the moment i just want to install it, i dont use it yet..what is better ?  @PTYX

[18-May-19 02:59 PM] Roxin#4844
lite or native ?

[18-May-19 03:07 PM] PTYX#6840
Lite is easier to manage.

[18-May-19 03:08 PM] PTYX#6840
You get a 12 or 24 word seed which backs up your wallet

[18-May-19 03:15 PM] Roxin#4844
so lite i dont have to backup just the 24 word ?

[18-May-19 03:15 PM] Roxin#4844
files or smth else i dont have to backup ? just the word ? and i have all the coins backed up in that word ?

[18-May-19 03:15 PM] Roxin#4844
@PTYX

[18-May-19 03:17 PM] PTYX#6840
yes, the seed (24 words) is used to restore your wallet or to export your privatekeys if you ever need to use them in a native wallet.

[18-May-19 03:18 PM] PTYX#6840
native wallets require you to save a file called a wallet.dat. It's a file that holds all your private-keys. If you lose the wallet.dat or don't back it up constantly you risk losing access to change addresses.

Hy to everyone ,

[18-May-19 05:25 PM] bogybogy#3962
I listen CNBC Africa and they interviewed few people well know in crypto and they where asking about the competitors of Eth, everyone following different projects but is sad none mentioned Komodo

[18-May-19 05:26 PM] bogybogy#3962
Guys with deep knowledge in crypto and Blockchain and they are following poor projects sad and they call them selves Blockchain experts

[18-May-19 05:31 PM] hastrup#8742
@bogybogy maybe the "experts" needs to eat. Komodo don't pay for that kind of marketing

[18-May-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the well known crypto personalities are not very technical

[18-May-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and dont follow the cutting edge tech

[18-May-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
they just repeat what they are paid to promote

[18-May-19 05:32 PM] jl777c#5810
since they make money by repeating blockchain advertisements, that does make them sort of a blockchain expert (on how to make money in blockchain)

[18-May-19 05:34 PM] bogybogy#3962
When this industry will start to  not have this uneducated promoters,even for a person like me nontechnical with basik knowledge about Blockchain I understand what is wrong with this projects

[18-May-19 05:35 PM] hastrup#8742
There is a podcast in Danmark it name is the millioner club there where a guy that postet money into vitalik before he was big he was ask what projects he had am eye on it was komodo he said so the right people know about komodo
