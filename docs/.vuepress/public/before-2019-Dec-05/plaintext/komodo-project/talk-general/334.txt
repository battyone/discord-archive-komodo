well it makes u doubt your keys are yours...

[06-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Azzie001#9397
ye i guess they did good

[06-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Azzie001#9397
if u trust that hacker got em first

[06-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Vertigo#0439
Has the hacker filled a complain about this yet asking where his coins are?

[06-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the team could have stolen all the funds and not giving it back and sold it in the market, but they didn't

[06-Jun-19 07:58 PM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
I think the hacker will file a form for his missing coins.

[06-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
It would be easier for jl too, since he is anonymous

[06-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Azzie001#9397
no, they can just steal from all the ppl that wont fill the form...and i bet there will be manhy

[06-Jun-19 07:58 PM] KayNut#7485
@Azzie001 I think you don't understand. The keys are yours until someone steal them from you because of a vuln/exploit like the hacker did. If there wasn't that exploit not @jl777c  nor the hacker would have gotten your keys.

the hacker had indeed started stealing funds, before we started sweeping

[06-Jun-19 07:58 PM] Azzie001#9397
i understand.but do u understand that they could just say hacker did it?

[06-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Azzie001#9397
did they got the hacker in jail? to say he did it? and he wasnt part of team?

[06-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Alexfrog#1338
do you understand that they arent?

[06-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then why not steal all?

[06-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Azzie001#9397
just admit its a possibility

[06-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Azzie001#9397

[06-Jun-19 08:00 PM] pinkcookie#4334
Possible but not the case in this instance

[06-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes, i considered that possibility and rejected it because it doesnt make sense as an action a rational actor would take

[06-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Azzie001#9397
in crypto many things dont make sense...

[06-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if youre going to hack your own people, you hack them, you dont donate your own KMD to make them whole again

[06-Jun-19 08:02 PM] KayNut#7485
team did build agama wallet with 3rd party libraries like it is very common

[06-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
a library dependancy used by agama was safe when they added it, but was updated later by the hacker to have the exploit.  when they used the newer version in a new agama release, the exploit was added

so the team made a mistake of not version locking the library module they were using

[06-Jun-19 08:03 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
a lot of other projects were using that dependency as well

[06-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
but i dont think it reasonable to think of this as a milicious action by the team

[06-Jun-19 08:04 PM] Azzie001#9397
see, i think builder knows house the best....I cannot claim they did it or didnt...but it makes me think...i dont just trust ppl blidly

@Azzie001 google what npm is and then read what they have to say about this
I think you will like "appeal to authority"

[06-Jun-19 08:05 PM] KayNut#7485
builder know there house best, fair point. But do they know the parts inside the house, like kitchen oven that malfunctions and burns down the house.

tru that

[06-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i understand your reaction, beacuse its a very painful thing to see your coins moved from your own wallet, and think you are hacked.  i felt the same way yesterday.  but please try to do your research on what happened and be reasonable

Things (shit) happen, and let's make the best of it

There are always risk on crytos.

[06-Jun-19 08:08 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
Also need to note that it was a vulnerability in only kmd agama wallet.. not kmd chain.

[06-Jun-19 08:09 PM] WorldOfCryptos#2719
It takes about less than 5 min to read the entire info and to understand it

Well actually I just came here to tell @jl777c and the team what a awesome job they did yesterday. That was disaster management on its finest. I came back home yesterday from work to see that my coins were not gone. But still I was much more relieved at work when I read that Komodo team already used the exploit to sweep all coins into a save address. Guys what you did there was outstanding with your transparency and your support. I’m more bullish than ever that this team and project can really change things. Thank you again!

@KayNut just because your funds were not swept does not mean they are safe

[06-Jun-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no guarantee that we got all the data the hacker got and every chance more addresses are at risk, we just dont know which ones. if you used the komodo agama, best to migrate to a secure address

My kmd account got neither swept by the bad hacker nor by the team and i used the agama a couple of times in last five months. What does it say?

[06-Jun-19 08:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this was best option when keys exposed to use them best possible way - secure exposed funds

[06-Jun-19 08:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for Agama wallet and team working on it actually it's disaster, if many libs were used you cant be sure there is no more exploits waiting

maybe writing from scratch necessary

Why take your time to produce a solid product when you can just hack yourself and take all your communities coins and put them where you see fit.

So much for security, decentralization & having control over your funds.   https://t.co/z76xHCKCN7 https://t.co/YTHCKtv9Tv

`why aren't u happy @Warkid ?`
Because the team didn't let the hacker(s) hack people, seems he wanted folks to lose all of their funds forever 🤷🏽

[06-Jun-19 09:35 PM] smalls#0439
According to the npm article tweeted by @KomodoPlatform, the exploit was accomplished by having the AgamaApp transmit a user's private keys to the attacker when the wallet is opened. Note, they have a demo video you can watch.

With that in mind, how did the dev team sweep all of the coins from wallets that haven't been opened? I personally had not opened my wallet in 3 weeks, yet my funds were swept to the "safe" wallet. How is that possible without another backdoor that the dev team was sitting on?

Second, how are they going to verify ownership of the swept funds? Right now they are only asking for email-coin-address-amount-txid I assume they will ask for the seed/keys to verify ownership before dispersing funds. But, if the attacker has the keys to wallets that were swept, can't the hacker just claim the swept funds by using multiple email addresses?

From the npm article: "  Here is a brief demonstration showing the Agama wallet sending my wallet seed to a remote server.

    After launching the wallet application on the left, you see a request to on the right which downloads the second stage payload. Once we enter in our wallet seed you will see another request to that remote server successfully stealing our wallet seed."

[06-Jun-19 09:37 PM] jeffjam#9765
Because the issues goes back more than 3 weeks.

[06-Jun-19 09:38 PM] smalls#0439
And if the attacker has my keys and claims my funds, how is the team going to know which one of us to send the coins to?

[06-Jun-19 09:41 PM] jeffjam#9765
Also think about that there will certainly be some unclaimed funds.

Burn the recovered coins and the hacker!

[06-Jun-19 09:43 PM] smalls#0439
If the team used the same exploit as the attacker, then they were aware of it when I last opened my wallet 3 weeks ago.

[06-Jun-19 09:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@smalls   Incorrect

[06-Jun-19 09:43 PM] smalls#0439
They would've had to have their own server in place to receive everyone's keys as their wallets are opened.

[06-Jun-19 09:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There will be a transparency report published when the investigations are complete .   My understanding though is the hacker slipped up a bit with how they were storing their info. However best to wait for our Cybersecurity experts complete analysis.

[06-Jun-19 09:49 PM] smalls#0439
We don't need an in depth analysis to determine that someone isn't telling the whole truth.

[06-Jun-19 09:51 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@smalls what you just said is a possibility, but doesn't mean that is the truth either ...

I agree, I'm not pointing fingers yet. Just looking for clarification.
