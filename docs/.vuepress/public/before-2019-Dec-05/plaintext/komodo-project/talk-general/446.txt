Not 100% sure, but claiming is basically just sending funds to self

[05-Nov-19 11:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So pressing claim or sending full balance to your own address

[05-Nov-19 11:12 PM] SHossain#0007
QT wallet is native and has wallet encryption feature

Thats a question for @ca333

if needed, create a new one time gmail address using tor browser / vpn and use that to download the apk and transfer to your phone

[06-Nov-19 12:27 PM] alperC#7758
If I'm not wrong TS saw a preview of it and it was pretty useless

[06-Nov-19 12:28 PM] alperC#7758
On top of that it costs a lot of money

[06-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Mark81#4505
Useless on what way?

[06-Nov-19 12:30 PM] TS#7923
I've seen the report, it's completely bogus. I mean we are very happy to be mentioned next to IBM and Accenture but the "study" is something a high school freshman would pull together. The people who published it have been trying to sell it to unsuspecting people now using the 3rd or 4th name for their "reseach institute".

[06-Nov-19 12:33 PM] gigamesh#3544

you need to submit your personal info for a sample, & pay for the full report, doesn't sound right to me.

anyone know the .conf file for Pirate

[06-Nov-19 05:29 PM] CHMEX#0686
The .conf is generated when you start the chain

[06-Nov-19 05:29 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
so I have to reindex?

[06-Nov-19 05:30 PM] Oszy#5734
no you should have the conf file already if you started the chain at least once

[06-Nov-19 05:30 PM] Oszy#5734
what OS are you on?

[06-Nov-19 05:31 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
windows, I was messing with the .conf file and forgot to backup what was originally there

[06-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Oszy#5734
if you delete the current file, it will be re-created on the next chain launch

[06-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Oszy#5734
the "original"

[06-Nov-19 05:32 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
that didnt work , left the file blank and restarted and I get teh red triangle in the agama wallet

[06-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Oszy#5734
dont leave it blank, completely delete it

[06-Nov-19 05:32 PM] Oszy#5734
only gets created if it's missing

a swap took like 30min to complete on atomicdex, is that normal? how are u going to improve trx speed?

[07-Nov-19 09:06 AM] Oszy#5734
we can't speed up the blockchains.

[07-Nov-19 09:06 AM] Oszy#5734
what did you swap?

[07-Nov-19 09:06 AM] CHMEX#0686
the speed depends mainly on the blockchain confirmations.
So if you swapped BTC /KMD the BTC speed is whats matters

[07-Nov-19 09:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
if you swapped between 607970 and 607973 the speed should be pretty fast between 607974 and how you would wait

[07-Nov-19 09:09 AM] thanksmia#4353
On the section claim your rewards, do beta tester get something?

[07-Nov-19 09:10 AM] thanksmia#4353
can u implement privacy coins like XMR  into  atomicdex?

[07-Nov-19 09:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
>>claim your rewards
that is for KMD is you hold KMD you get 5% Rewards per Year. ALl you have to do is spend ( to your self ) once each 30 days

[07-Nov-19 09:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
There are plans to implement ARRR ( PIRATE ) but much work needs to be done first

[07-Nov-19 09:14 AM] thanksmia#4353
have u guys thought about using  smart contracts to trade  Privacy coins on a dex?

[07-Nov-19 09:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
P2SH addresses ( b addresses on KMD ) are some kind of basic smart contract

[07-Nov-19 09:22 AM] thanksmia#4353
Have u planned to add privacy coins into  a DEX?

Wow, I woke up this morning, half a zombie, with the goal of surviving the day and ticking a few things off the todo list. It was a bit of a worry to see all the messages in the inbox.  That all changed when I started reading.

I'm quite surprised and humbled by the bounty.

Thanks to the support that's been given I've had the opportunity to speak with many people recently, some in the top of their field. People who I'd never have expected to meet.  This is because of you, and the world you are creating from here.  I can do this because I know that you are standing beside me, and many of you have been here before.

You may not realize it but you have taken a totally average person, an anybody, and through your patience, guidance and encouragement have given that person the power and the tools to effect real change in this world.    

This is the promise of crypto that I read of.  I'm seeing now that it is more than a promise.  It is something real for all of us, just sitting there, waiting to be grabbed hold of and put into practice. 

The people who were named this month are some of the many examples of this. You have my great respect.

Any of us can contribute in our own way.  And the more I see of other projects, the more it becomes clearer that Komodo is something very worth contributing to.

Thank you to everyone for being here and doing your part towards creating a better future.
