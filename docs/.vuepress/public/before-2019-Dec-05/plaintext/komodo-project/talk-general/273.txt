Why would it fail that if I only have it false by 0.99%?

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens?

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, 0.99% you are okl

[19-Apr-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a 2% attack

[19-Apr-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
bias by +1% then by -1%, but this is mitigated by 51% correlation

[19-Apr-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
still possible if you sustain 51% attack for days

[19-Apr-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and you get to bias prices by 1%

[19-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Timo#5756
Okay, I would agree that this would be secure enough for a lot of use cases. But in no way more secure than Chainlink with aggregation+reputation+stake+TEE.
It's really clever binding the volatility to the blocks, limiting it, it is elegant. My first question I had after reading the article was, what is with other types of data than can't fluctuate by 1%? Like weather data that changes a lot more or completely non-numeric ones?

[19-Apr-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
use logarithms

[19-Apr-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
prices do change by more than 1%, in such a case there is an exeption that allows a 1% change and in 10 blocks it is changed by 10%

[19-Apr-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so as long as things arent changing by 50% all the time, it will work, with a delay

[19-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Timo#5756
Yeah but now I need something that can mirror price changes by 50% to 1000% for example

[19-Apr-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
like duke said, use logaritms to reduce the dynamic range

[19-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Timo#5756
Is there a way to use Komodo Oracles or are they not made for non-price use cases?

[19-Apr-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can change the 1% tolerance level to a different amount

[19-Apr-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but that will prevent detecting false data if it is too big

[19-Apr-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for non-numeric things as long as it is just one valid answer, then all the nodes would require that specific answer

[19-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Timo#5756
But I would have to change the whole consensus rule of the oracle chain. I still need the 1% rule for my price-data use cases

[19-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we are all about making custom consensus (CC) here

[19-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
you can have dozens of different consensus rules, each applying to a specific type of tx

[19-Apr-19 12:21 PM] gcharang#6833
and we can have as many secure chains  as we want here in Komodo Platform with dPoW

A new chain for every application

[19-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Timo#5756
Yeah but the only thing making the price 'true' is the 1% rule. If we can't apply it to non-numeric data, how can we now detect the true and false data? Only by democratic game theory? I could Sybil attack it then

[19-Apr-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean true/false oracle?

[19-Apr-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be easiest as there is no variance that needs to be handled

[19-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Timo#5756
@gcharang Yeah I understand that one. Besides other cryptos, having weak hashpower or centralized stakes, Komodo is kinda linked to the BTC chain and getting the security of that hashpower in some way. I don't know how exactly it works but I heard about it. Thats cool

[19-Apr-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
rather than have a single chain do everything, we just spin up a dedicated chain for a dedicated task

[19-Apr-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
with CC pretty much anything can be done

[19-Apr-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
at least so far I have been able to do dozens of new consensus rules

[19-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Timo#5756
The decision making is easier, but you don't have security against Sybil Attack here

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes there is

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_wonders why you didn't ask all of this before lambasting Komodo by writing a book on twitter_

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt matter how many miners you have or nodes

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if the data is invalid, it is rejected

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
like trying to use a timestamp from tomorrow

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Timo#5756
I'm gonna use a chain that is for non-numeric data. And I see there are currently 50 nodes live. Now I'm gonna spin up 100 and feed wrong data into. What prevents me from that?

[19-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Timo#5756
Who says it's invalid?

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
lets change this to discuss timestamp to make it more concrete, ok?

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you are the attacker and you want to convince the network that your timestamp is the right one

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Timo#5756
Timestamp is a different thing

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is data from outside world

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
each node has a local system clock

[19-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Timo#5756
Sorry, thought about block number not timestamp... lol

[19-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so you want to convince the network it is actually one hour from now, ok?

[19-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
try your attack

[19-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes are checking incoming timestamps to be no more than 1 minute from the future, relative to local system clock

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
anything else is rejected

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
any node that does this too much is banned

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you can have 1 million nodes

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
all one hour ahead

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
attack!

[19-Apr-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you submit to the network

[19-Apr-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[19-Apr-19 12:28 PM] gcharang#6833
the lying miner who won't be getting his block reward

[19-Apr-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
miner of invalid data doesnt get to mine the block

[19-Apr-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
no, but if they persist they get banned

[19-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
and no node will interact with it

[19-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
still waiting for attack... since no attacker block an honest miner mined a valid timestamp

[19-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
to attack this you need to change the local system clocks on all the nodes

[19-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it is so simple, anybody can tell it is resistant to bad data. there is no complex interaction of reputation, rewards, punishments

[19-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
frontrunning, freeloading

[19-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
all that complexity goes out the window

[19-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
replaced by each node comparing all data with their local version

[19-Apr-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems Timo left us, i guess his attack against this was to leave?

[19-Apr-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there are timewarp attacks, which involve biasing the timestamp forward and backward within allowed limits to game the mining difficulty

[19-Apr-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
and similarily the data can be biased +/-1% here, which is an issue and maybe the tolerance should be lowered to 0.5%, but that slows down the adapting to the real price changes of 10% or more and maybe we get more local nodes rejecting what is valid

[19-Apr-19 12:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you want a system to break, make it complex.  If you want someting to work, make it simple.
This has applied to... Reefkeeping, raising children, fixing my car, making food and more.

[19-Apr-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
you seemed to not believe this works

[19-Apr-19 12:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can go on... but Simple > complex

[19-Apr-19 12:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
wut?

[19-Apr-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is literally 500 lines of code I wrote in a weekend

[19-Apr-19 12:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
K bye

or taking 2 minutes to stop shilling your own bag.

[19-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i did think about all the rewards/incentives systems and my conclusion was it was very complex to get it perfectly right and zack would just say "offchain bets"

[19-Apr-19 12:36 PM] gcharang#6833
this is simply how satoshi consensus works, the most basic blockchain tech

[19-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems i did

[19-Apr-19 12:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Explain how "timestamp" validation is more complex than "aggregation+reputation+stake+TEE."

[19-Apr-19 12:37 PM] mrlynch#5735
`you don't solve the oracle problem in a weekend` what if you do?!

[19-Apr-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i also wrote oracles CC, which would be a trusted oracle or aggregated

[19-Apr-19 12:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
KMD has had oracles in development for years?

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so?

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Their ICO was closed in a day, does that make it less valid?

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why does the trustless oracle solution have to take years with dozens of coders

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Time =/= quallity of work.

[19-Apr-19 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
It's only "good" if it takes a million lines of code to make it work?
