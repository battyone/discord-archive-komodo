@srmoon if you are only missing one word, it's possible to bruteforce (maybe 2). You can try all possible words: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md

browsers (as in all browsers) are such unbelievably shitty pieces of software, and they won't get any better

[20-Jun-19 04:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
best to use Midori or lynx or Epiphany- but then many corps will refuse to do business with you

[20-Jun-19 04:06 PM] LocoMB#8593
Tails is a good approach to viable opsec- get a fresh install each time you launch your 'browser' ... strictly speaking, 'browsers' are really shitty encapsulated mini-OSses

i just read email of komodo agma wallet

[20-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Mastermind#1578
and bit confused what i should do about my KMD and coins

[20-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Mastermind#1578
can someone link me towards a guide ? i had native agma wallet which i havnt ran in a while

[20-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Mastermind#1578
@Deleted User i actually dont know that either

[20-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Mastermind#1578
so if i am reading it right users who ran0.3.5 were affected only ?

[20-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Mastermind#1578
or 3.5

[20-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Mastermind#1578
whichever it is

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
if you didn't use lite mode you likely were not affected

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
how long ago you used agama

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Mastermind#1578
no i never used lite mode

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
native mode could have been affected too

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on what you did

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Mastermind#1578
and i used it long ago i still have v0.0.41d-beta installed

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
less likely , but still possible

[20-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Mastermind#1578
0.2.41d

[20-Jun-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is ancient. ok just verify funds are still there on explorer

[20-Jun-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and when you update, update to the verus wallet

[20-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Mastermind#1578
was my next question where to find my private key of installed agma i have and move to verus

[20-Jun-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if native mode, you wouldnt need to, but if you dumpprivkey from cli that would work

[20-Jun-19 06:16 PM] jl777c#5810
or export privkey from the verus wallet, always good to have the privkey in an offline backup

[20-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Mastermind#1578
do i need to sync wallet first ?

[20-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Mastermind#1578
of this old agma client

[20-Jun-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
not to get the privkey

[20-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Mastermind#1578
so i launch activate coin  and wait for loading to finish i guess

[20-Jun-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
with the verus wallet

[20-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Mastermind#1578
no agma

[20-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Mastermind#1578
i am trying to get my key

[20-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Mastermind#1578
or can verus grab my key localy ?

[20-Jun-19 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, the ancient one. yes i guess so that is fine

[20-Jun-19 06:20 PM] Mastermind#1578

hello all. im sure this must have been asked before. wondering if dPoW will eventually use lightning network to reduce fees?

[20-Jun-19 11:12 PM] gigamesh#3544
or will that not make much difference cause dPoW uploads a large amount of data?

[20-Jun-19 11:14 PM] phm87#7395
I don't think that use LN itself for dPoW can work. But a discussion happened about making segwit btx tx instead of legacy btc tx, it can reduce btc tx fees used to notarize (up to 80% of reduction). It requires a huge work into iguana and jl777 is against segwit

[20-Jun-19 11:17 PM] gigamesh#3544
ah yes, true. how long do they stay open?

[20-Jun-19 11:18 PM] phm87#7395
no, it depends to timelock

[20-Jun-19 11:18 PM] gigamesh#3544
@phm87 interesting, ty

[20-Jun-19 11:19 PM] gigamesh#3544
but isnt being against segwit largely irrelevant since segwit is here?

[20-Jun-19 11:21 PM] gigamesh#3544
(i really need to read up on segwit and no little about it, so go easy on me haha)

[20-Jun-19 11:26 PM] gigamesh#3544
you mean segwit didnt break dPoW?

[20-Jun-19 11:27 PM] gigamesh#3544
im curious about this being against segwit thing. hasnt the ship sailed on that now segwit is here? or is there a concern that segwit will be abandoned and that taking the time to change dPoW isnt justifiable?

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] phm87#7395
``Channels can stay open indefinitely: as long as the two parties in the channel continue to cooperate with each other, the channel can stay open indefinitely -- there is no mandatory timeout period. This can further reduce the load on the blockchain as well as allow the fees for opening and closing the channel to be amortized over a longer period of time.``

[20-Jun-19 11:36 PM] phm87#7395
it seems you are right

[20-Jun-19 11:37 PM] phm87#7395
about nota, btc tx from iguana are using 1* address (legacy) that have high fee tx. A tx from 3* address is segwit enabled and retrocompatible so it can send to a 3* or 1*. And there is the last one cb* (?) that is segwit only

[20-Jun-19 11:51 PM] phm87#7395
but if you close the channel, you'll get back your funds after a certain time (counted in blocks)

coming from python, I explored js a bit a few years ago and I was appalled about how sitty it is- beginning with that it does not have real namespaces, but some silly travesty of namespaces,
and so on and so on.. js is ... some kind  _blubberlutsch_  üëÅ‚Äçüó® soapy, bubbly, glichy, detergent with pungent artificial smell, and it really stings if you get it into eyes or mouth

[21-Jun-19 06:28 AM] LocoMB#8593
by the way: I saw dissenter has released their full fledged browser as a fork of brave browser- I'll give it a test drive over the next cpl days...
mostly I use opera, that has a few warts too, but seems the least bad choice- Midori is kind of cool also

[21-Jun-19 06:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
_ Type Confusion in Array.pop_ .. so these morons had such convoluted code that they couldn't remember the difference between an integer and a float and a char string!?!?

right. sandbox:
_a sandbox escape vulnerability in Prompt:Open Inter-process communication (IPC) messages due to insufficient vetting of parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a non-sandboxed parent process to open web content from a compromised child process using a specially crafted Prompt:Open IPC message between the child and parent process. Combining both CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 can result in arbitrary code execution._
