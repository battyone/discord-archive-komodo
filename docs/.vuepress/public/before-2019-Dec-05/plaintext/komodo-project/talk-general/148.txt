It's a major update to the Blockchain.

[13-Dec-18 01:53 AM] yorklab#7270
Adding more capabilities.

[13-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Daiyox#2701
For holding purposes all you need to do is make sure you have the latest wallet, and continue as usual

[13-Dec-18 01:54 AM] stock999#4818
What should we do with our KMD and  other KMD based, such as zilla for instance?  Which wallets, exchanges, etc. will support it?

[13-Dec-18 01:54 AM] yorklab#7270
Update to latest wallet; otherwise you don't have to do anything.

[13-Dec-18 01:56 AM] stock999#4818
@Daiyox  So, it will be just a technical upgrade of all tools?

[13-Dec-18 01:57 AM] Daiyox#2701
Technically it's a sizable upgrade, yes..For details certainly check the website as it would be lengthy to go over here

[13-Dec-18 01:59 AM] Daiyox#2701
@stock999 After going over the update, if something isn't clear however, ask away

[13-Dec-18 02:06 AM] stock999#4818
@Daiyox  I have saved  the seed phrase  for my wallets. Is it enough in order to restore my wallet after Dec15 with the latest wallet version?  Right?

[13-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Daiyox#2701
Yes, absolutely

[13-Dec-18 02:09 AM] Daiyox#2701
You may additionally want to backup your wallet.dat, but as long as you have your seed phrase you can always restore after the upgrade, or after many upgrades, it is your lifetime key

[13-Dec-18 02:11 AM] stock999#4818
Thanks @Daiyox   Now it's clear

[13-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Daiyox#2701
@stock999 Welcome and awesome 😃

Must be ‘rubbing’ off on me @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[13-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@coingirl87 what I meant was that there is a command, that when you claim the rewards, these rewards are not sent to your main wallet, but to another wallet of your choice.

[13-Dec-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And then you dont mention the wallet where the intrest/rewards are sent to

[13-Dec-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So as far as the taxman knows, you dont have any rewards and thus dont have to pay taxes on the entire amount

[13-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure what the command was, I’m sure @jl777c or one of the devs will know, I just know a feature like that exists and might be a solution to the problem.

[13-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
-donate=pubkey parameter on komodod when launched will send the rewards to the pubkey address

✅ (2) 💯 

[13-Dec-18 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
does the rewards sent after the start of the daemon?

[13-Dec-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it just sends rewards to the donation pubkey instead of the usual destination

[13-Dec-18 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
can anyone spoonfeed me on why KMD is better than ETH

[13-Dec-18 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
supose all mining coins stop, what happens with KMD?

[13-Dec-18 12:48 PM] gcharang#6833
So whenever a txn is done, whatever is the reward that will be claimed by your address, will be sent to the `donation`  address automatically

[13-Dec-18 12:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@Tek dPoW is only the beginning. With it you get BTC level re-org protection. But beyond that, there is new tech in development that allows for cross-chain contracts based on notarization data.

[13-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd smartcontracts are utxo based and not balance based is one of the benefits I read often

[13-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so when there is a problem with your smartcontract, not your entire balance is at stake as it is with ETH where some contracts were completely whiped out because of a bug.

[13-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Tek#5253
nice

[13-Dec-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
with ETH a single popular dapp boosts gas fees for everyone on the network and maybe at some point it is just too expensive to use. that is one cats game. what if there are 100 such popular dapps? Actually, on ETH that is impossible. Just imagine what would happen if there were 100 dapps as active as cryptokitties...

[13-Dec-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
with KMD, we had a KMDICE chain do almost a million tx in a day, paying txfees in KMDICE and no other KMD chain even noticed, since it is an independent chain. We can easily imagine 100+ independent chains, each with a dedicated dapp., actually there is no limit to the number of indepedent chains, since they are independent

[13-Dec-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
10,000 chains, even more are possible

[13-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Tek  ETH is one blockchain with support for smart contracts. So developers and entrepreneurs can easily build on ETH and create tokens or dApps. But they do not get a blockchain. They just get tokens or they get a dApp with shared infrastructure (because there is just one blockchain) and this leads to massive congestion, like jl777 said above.  Komodo is better because it's not a single blockchain, like ETH is. Komodo is a platform that gives every project their own blockchain, with independent infrastructure, no shared blockchain, no congestion. And, on top of all that, each chain launched with Komodo has support for smart contracts, tokens, dApps, etc. So basically every project that builds with Komodo is given an Ethereum platform to build with.

[13-Dec-18 01:44 PM] Tek#5253

`I believe in SV

"locking" any part of the protocol is precisely **non**-"SV", but sure

[13-Dec-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In any true sense, one can only attribute to the "vision" of "satoshi" as that which is in the whitepaper and the whitepaper states the exact opposite of "locking" protocol (that nodes decide, by vote of using code, what code is/isn't valid)

[13-Dec-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
also that anti-decentralization thing...

[13-Dec-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there is no decentralized, because only miners are nodes :trollface:

Will I be able to stake my KMDs on the new wallet?

[14-Dec-18 03:53 AM] Hermes#6934
Everything will stay the same...the claiming of rewards will be as usual...the update main purpose is the implementation of Sapling .

[14-Dec-18 05:59 AM] lord kek#0511
does KMD participate in the forming of the consensus of the pirateChain? What I'm trying to ask is, does the KMD chain snapshot the chain with most work, or is there some "magic" involved in figuring out what to snapshot?

[14-Dec-18 06:00 AM] lord kek#0511
Had a conversation with @PirateChain at twitter and he suggested I come here to ask these questions

[14-Dec-18 06:01 AM] lord kek#0511
also, sorry if KMD is not the correct term. I mean what ever the thing is, that provides dPoW for PirateChain

[14-Dec-18 06:13 AM] lord kek#0511
To clarify my question, say I managed to get enough hashpower to 51% attack the native PirateChain, say I decided to mine empty blocks or just transactions I wanted to include or what ever (assuming I'm not altering the consensus rules or anything like that), rest of the network would keep on operating like it's been doing before. Now say my version of the chain accumulates more work, does KMD snapshot my version of the ledger or is there something in the mix that can pick and choose which fork they consider valid?

[14-Dec-18 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
@lord kek the public chain will get notarized

[14-Dec-18 06:24 AM] lord kek#0511
@Alright What do you mean by public chain?

[14-Dec-18 06:26 AM] Alright#0419
which ever chain has consensus between the notary nodes will get notarized

[14-Dec-18 06:26 AM] Alright#0419
if that chain has someone mining empty blocks, it will get notarized

[14-Dec-18 06:27 AM] lord kek#0511
So if I only build on top of my own chain and manage to accumulate more work, mine will get notarized?

[14-Dec-18 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
if it's public

[14-Dec-18 06:28 AM] lord kek#0511
yeah, can be public for the purpose I'm asking for

[14-Dec-18 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
and doesn't try to rewrite a notarized block

[14-Dec-18 06:29 AM] lord kek#0511
Do you feel this changes the game theory of PoW compared to say btc?

[14-Dec-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
in regards to what

[14-Dec-18 06:29 AM] lord kek#0511
the incentives and attack vectors

[14-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
mining incentivize is the same as BTC other than notary's mining blocks as well

[14-Dec-18 06:30 AM] Alright#0419
it mitigates many attack vectors that BTC or a BTC fork has

[14-Dec-18 06:31 AM] lord kek#0511
I don't think it is the same tho

[14-Dec-18 06:31 AM] lord kek#0511
because btc has no limit to the number of block that can reorg

[14-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
sure it does

[14-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
there is a 99 block limit first of all

[14-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
and not enough hardware in the world to even accomplish that

[14-Dec-18 06:34 AM] lord kek#0511
as far as I understand, here the limit is on average 3 blocks?

[14-Dec-18 06:34 AM] Alright#0419
typically 10

[14-Dec-18 06:37 AM] lord kek#0511
So basically it's a sprint to reach most work for every 10 blocks and then the other side has no alternative but build on top of mine?

[14-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Alright#0419
basically

[14-Dec-18 06:38 AM] lord kek#0511
So, it's a cat and mouse game that resets every 10 minutes?

[14-Dec-18 06:39 AM] lord kek#0511
if that's the case, how is that the same as btc, where 99 blocks is 16.5 hours?

[14-Dec-18 06:40 AM] lord kek#0511
doesn't that change the game theory at all?

[14-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
what game theory in particular are you talking about

[14-Dec-18 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
from the perspective of a KMD miner vs BTC miner, not much difference

[14-Dec-18 06:41 AM] lord kek#0511
well with btc, the miners mining their fork is insentivized to protect the block rewards they have accumulated
