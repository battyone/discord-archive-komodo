@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 "serving as fiat market maker can bring nice profit due to spread, but the problem I see is how to make such market maker not manipulate, so that a fiat-pegged asset would be stable, kind of special reward for stabilization weould need to be inveted, that would be good enough for big fiat players"

This is what the article I posted above alludes to. Basically the fiat exchange rate is a Schelling Point which can be translated into a blockchain using the design in the article.

I got turned around at some point in this conversation. I'm not looking for holes or anything, it's fine with me either way, I'm just wondering, is the theoretical attack he's talking about a way for a majority of notaries to double spend after notarization, or is the attack he's talking about only before notarization? I don't see a problem either way, to be clear.

[13-Jan-19 09:58 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Here's the attack you mention:  "If what you are saying that there are some theoretically unlikely (but not 100% impossible) scenarios where the majority of notaries in conjunction with significant hashrate can conduct attacks that are harder to do than normal and further identify the attacker directly, then maybe we can agree to that."

Is this after notarization? It seems so.

[13-Jan-19 09:59 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Even so, after conversations with the fine folk here, I agree that this attack is harder to do than attacking Bitcoin itself, but if we can find ways to improve on Bitcoin, that would be killer.

[13-Jan-19 10:03 PM] garbonzo607#4659
To be clear, at this point, I'm a Komodo believer, I don't need any more convincing. I just want to learn and discuss.

[13-Jan-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure what you mean by `Is this after notarization? It seems so.`

[13-Jan-19 10:07 PM] garbonzo607#4659
The attack Taek or however you spell it is talking about.

[13-Jan-19 10:07 PM] Alright#0419
his proposed attack would be majority of notaries and majority of hashrate colluding to notarize a chian that was not public

[13-Jan-19 10:07 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Yep Edit: I sounded like I knew what you were saying here, but you helped me understand.

[13-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Alright#0419
majority of notaries is an understatement, more like supermajority as that can't pick and choose who they will notarize with

[13-Jan-19 10:08 PM] garbonzo607#4659
It's my understanding that a majority of notaries can remove other notaries, is that right? I don't know the complete details of that process.

[13-Jan-19 10:09 PM] garbonzo607#4659
It's supposed to be if a notary isn't performing their duties.

[13-Jan-19 10:14 PM] Alright#0419
They technically could but there is no precedence for this

[13-Jan-19 10:15 PM] garbonzo607#4659
But what I'm getting at is, it's a way to double spend, right? Where he says this:

> This is precisely how double spends happen. There's one fork where the exchange got the money and the money confirmed, and there's another fork where the exchange didn't get the money. Notary nodes split the network and fork the exchange onto a smaller-work, not widely accepted fork where they got the money, while the rest of the network continues forward on the fork where the exchange doesn't have the money.

[13-Jan-19 10:16 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Does this bypass the dPoW-conf protection or not? EDIT: Nevermind, you said the new chain gets notarized, so it does bypass any protection. I believe I get it.

[13-Jan-19 10:18 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Can't stress enough, that I still believe this is a harder attack than even Bitcoin, with its mining pools. I just want to make sure I understand the attack vector, however unlikely it is.

[13-Jan-19 10:21 PM] garbonzo607#4659
I think I get it now.

@jorian Thank you so much. I hate coding and math (I don't like rules or limitations, I never liked to color within the lines), so I can't help there, but I will try to write articles explaining crypto and how Komodo fits in if I get motivated to. I believe articles should be collaborative, since no one person has all knowledge, or the best way to articulate it to readers, so you need input from multiple places. The hardest part would be gathering a team of collaborators.

[13-Jan-19 10:44 PM] Alright#0419

Im thinking regarding exchange listings - many KMD projects got tokens and they struggle to get listing... Might be really good idea to make "joined listing" which could lower the prices ? For example make a deal with exchange to list KMD, Verus, Chips, Hush, Arrr, BTCH, DEX, Supernet ....  like 10-15 tokens at once. Usually when doing massive trade you got a discount, so I think even 30-50% discount would be doable, since it would be a good amount of about 15-20 BTC ?

[14-Jan-19 09:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Maybe  an "auction" for few selected exchanges could be done, meaning - they would fight for what prices they could make such listing

rather than established ones

[14-Jan-19 12:12 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
These tokens will try listing on established exchanges anyway. It will be just more expensive when doing separately I think. But may be that there is more power when projects joining for a cause, especially when these are same environment/platform related tokens.

[14-Jan-19 12:14 PM] Honeybadger#5573
Just like how it is easier for ERC-20s or all NEP-5s to get listed on exchanges. I am unsure on the dev specs side but grouping all under a category is probably more easier.

[14-Jan-19 12:15 PM] Honeybadger#5573
Are there any exchanges, which could potentially list projects for free? You get more visibility and kill the pricing issue. Two birds one stone kinda scenario.

[14-Jan-19 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been in contact with project SONO or something... they contacted me... They said if trading volumes on KMD were large wenough they would add it as a base pair and likley any Assetchains, as the daemon is the same its almost zero work to add them

[14-Jan-19 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
However this really doesnt matter, as new exchanges are most likely all going to fail in this market 😦

[14-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Arboreal#3777
no I mean upcoming exchanges are far more likely to list tokens in batches

[14-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Arboreal#3777

I was rooting for Liquidity Network to be honest, but it never went off the ground LOL. Gnosis would be interesting once it releases sometime later. But again issue is would they be willing to list for cheap. 

That's what Binance did I think, they listed all potential projects early on and got community/volume growing. Though of course there are other elements at play as well namely liquidity, UI, security.

[14-Jan-19 12:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
At this point why should we believe in "cheap listings" ? In the bear market exchanges make very little on fees, so the need money from listings.

[14-Jan-19 12:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
WE do not talk about cheap listing, but discount when listing many coins at once. It's not cheap. For 10 tokens you could pay 15-20BTC. It's not cheap.

[14-Jan-19 12:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

how do you guys see Komodo against ecosystems like Cardano? I wonder what everybody is so hyped on Cardano.
