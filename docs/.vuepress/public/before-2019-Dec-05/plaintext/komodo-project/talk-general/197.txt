but damn good job @Decker - understanding that the first character to be used leftsided from the period - thats really good! sharp sense!

[03-Feb-19 03:52 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
but plz puzzles with no erorrs because if i could find the soloution  still because of that different symbol i could not crack it

[03-Feb-19 03:54 PM] Decker#3767
@mazyar_lp ca333 is right, users could try `"` and `”` both ... i'm tried both ... but my mistake was in that i forget to remove last two symbols of non-interview text when trying `"` variant ) i'm also tried variants with word `fire` without any quotes )

well this can not be excluded @mazyar_lp - you have to TRY

[03-Feb-19 03:55 PM] ca333#0118
its a cryptoPUZZLE - not a "crackme-tutorial"

the text was the map to crack the puzzle . your puzzles should be cracked by normal non tech users too

`your puzzles should be cracked by normal non tech users too`
To be fair, although I'm aware it will come across condescending, with some of the minds in this space, you have to realize that if it takes them days to solve complex puzzles it will take them seconds to solve non-tech puzzles and you wouldn't be any better off

u just mis understood me. i just asked puzzles to be cracked within puzzle hints

[03-Feb-19 04:03 PM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 all puzzles posted here can be cracked by every user ... it's not hard to take last character of every words ends with `.` ...

[03-Feb-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No, I understood fine; I'm saying that if it's "obvious" then there are those among us that will solve it before you or I can even finish reading it

[03-Feb-19 04:05 PM] cryptocat#9465
and trial and error is a common practice for cryptic puzzle solvers...as witnessed in this puzzle

[03-Feb-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all puzzles posted here can be cracked by every user `
I beg to disagree, given 100 years I would have never solved the one with the line return

[03-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 here i should agree with you ... for all passphrase it's just a string ... not multiline string ...

Hi all. What is the dpow lite @ca333  is tweeting about and how does that differ from dpow?

[03-Feb-19 04:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Decker I had checked the correct seed, manualy, in agama, so I probably looked at the zero balance not updated immediatly, or what could be the reason I missed it?

[03-Feb-19 04:13 PM] zatJUM#9924
Should I find a way to check via cli?

[03-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Decker#3767
@zatJUM best way is to enter possible solution in Agama and compare address with `puzzle address` ...

[03-Feb-19 04:14 PM] zatJUM#9924
is there any tool cli to convert a string to address?

[03-Feb-19 04:15 PM] ca333#0118
@barv - go to #kmdlabs they invented it. (its basically a liteish dPoW which means you can start notarizing onto KMD without even asking us for it - bascally open and free dPoW for the world)

[03-Feb-19 04:15 PM] Decker#3767
Such RPC method to get address and privkey from passphrase will be added to Komdo-Qt wallet soon.

thats also a help for puzzle-crackers. 😃

[03-Feb-19 04:18 PM] Decker#3767
We already have it, but it will be available in public with next release, which will contain some new features ... like this RPC method, themes support (main idea - to have nice custom theme for each assetchain) and other things ...

[03-Feb-19 04:19 PM] zatJUM#9924
Thank you, all, I have some hints to be more efficient for next puzzle 😉

Seems should be some way how to measure this peaks and convert it in values ... may be it's a letters of alphabet. Mean - 0 - corresponding 'A', 1 - 'B', 2 - 'C' ... etc ... Negative Y values can be like -1 - `Z`, -2 - `Y` ...

But horizontal length between peaks can also means something ...

[03-Feb-19 08:43 PM] oyea#4849
so whats the question here

[03-Feb-19 08:44 PM] oyea#4849
sorry, late joiner

[03-Feb-19 08:48 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
Is this puzzle need programming skills?? @ca333

[03-Feb-19 08:50 PM] oyea#4849
what sort of solution are we looking for?

[03-Feb-19 08:50 PM] oyea#4849
does it translate to a private key?

[03-Feb-19 08:50 PM] oyea#4849
or is it more ambiguous than that??

[03-Feb-19 08:51 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
maybe there is some noise that has to be removed..

[03-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Decker#3767
Don't know yet, just analyzing ... may be will be second post with background image ... or something else ...

👌 

[03-Feb-19 08:55 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
or maybe we need some maths to solve this.

[03-Feb-19 08:56 PM] linuxcaptain#2335
Fourier maybe

[03-Feb-19 09:02 PM] ca333#0118
no extra maths needed. no 2nd image coming. all you need to know is in the original picture

troll_lol 👍 Komodo ♥ 

[03-Feb-19 09:02 PM] oyea#4849
is the solution a number?

[03-Feb-19 09:03 PM] oyea#4849
i missed the last one, what was the solution? just so i have some context

[03-Feb-19 09:08 PM] ca333#0118
@oyea can not hint what data-type the solution is. 
last one was a alphanumeric sequence with few special symbols.

[03-Feb-19 09:08 PM] oyea#4849
ok

[03-Feb-19 09:08 PM] oyea#4849
thanks

[03-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Decker#3767
May be only "heart" and "komodo logo" is significant on this screen ) And solution can be something like "I Love Komodo" ))

[03-Feb-19 09:10 PM] oyea#4849
its a heart rate vs time graph

❌ 👌 

[03-Feb-19 09:14 PM] oyea#4849
if theres only 2 absolute outputs (1's, 0's), how would you define peaks and lows? theyre all a bit different

if your heart rate looks like that then you should visit a doctor

for complex calculations the picture is too poor quality, most likely there is something simple.

[03-Feb-19 09:54 PM] Decker#3767
agreed ... something like 3 states ... -1, 0, 1 ...

[03-Feb-19 09:55 PM] Decker#3767
points above 0, points near 0, and points right on 0 ...

[03-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Gawain#7858
checked image for slightly off colored pixels, none found

[03-Feb-19 10:36 PM] Gawain#7858
I have a pretty good guess on this one, but I'm also drunk, so hard to think

[03-Feb-19 10:58 PM] cryptocat#9465
The points seem too random for there to a length value given to each.

[03-Feb-19 11:00 PM] cryptocat#9465
But there can be values in the number of points on each shape and wave on the image. So the heart has 2 points, the Komodo logo has 24...

[03-Feb-19 11:01 PM] cryptocat#9465
And we've been given a baseline in the wave form. So I've tried calculating the number of waves that occur above the baseline, then the number below it.

[03-Feb-19 11:02 PM] cryptocat#9465
But nothing yet 😃

[03-Feb-19 11:05 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'd upload an image of my sketch but I don't have the option to.
