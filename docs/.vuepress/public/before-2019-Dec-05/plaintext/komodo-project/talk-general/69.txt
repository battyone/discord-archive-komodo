I'm poking around the API docs but can't find an SDK, or generated docs

[18-Sep-18 03:07 AM] nii236#2759
just walls of text

[18-Sep-18 03:07 AM] nii236#2759
This can easily go out of date

[18-Sep-18 03:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I would submit the suggestion to the #internal-qa-testing  or #support channel as they are working on the docs and can better answer your inquiries than me

[18-Sep-18 03:10 AM] nii236#2759
No worries

Well BarterDex isn't working the greatest for me, won't load properly. My balances keep disappearing and won't let me make a trade. Is this a Windows problem? Should I try Linux/Ubuntu instead?

[18-Sep-18 04:32 AM] Nabob#5004
Just ask your queries #dev-tradebots ,  If you have difficulties In accessing BarterDEX, You can give a try #dex-hyperdex  It is much more simpler interface

i want the project leads or developer or community manager to know that i came into your discord with questions about your project. i'm not going to read a whitepaper just for a specific mining question on the appropriate channel. one of your "kmd representatives" or so he thinks idk who the fuck it is decides to talk shit not answer my question and engage with "i'm better than you rhetoric"  or 'you're stupid" mentality. i won't be purchasing any kmd, or mining, or ocntributing to this project due to that right there.

[18-Sep-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Anyone that wants to follow the conversation and read the detail of how the trailerpark child 👆 didn't actually want to know anything beyond what he wanted to hear before he "asked", can freely go to #talk-mining

[18-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Resistor#1215
yeah you're full of shit and dreadful to ask questions to.. i said i don't want to talk to you and you still provoking

[18-Sep-18 12:18 PM] snowdamn#2414
mining is so gay, especially with you guys fighting like that 🤣

[18-Sep-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
plz control your language

[18-Sep-18 12:19 PM] Resistor#1215
control your "staker" asshat kmd rep... i think i'll write a publication about this experience.  holy shit

[18-Sep-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
you did not like the answers you heard and started making some silly claims

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
you didn't answer one question i asked

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i answered all of them

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
i asked you where can I mine with 98% of the nethash on one pool?

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
you did not give me a pool

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
or a link to a list of pools

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
or explain to me why you were attacked this weekend?

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there are several pools, you cant find them?

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] Resistor#1215
there are like 3

[18-Sep-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
we werent attacked this weekend

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Resistor#1215

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Resistor#1215
not what websites are showing

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Resistor#1215
there is no mining list of pools on the website that i can find

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
what attack? you are making things up

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Resistor#1215
instead i get linked to a whitepaper and talk shit to like i'm suppose to know your project

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] Resistor#1215

WhatToMine - KMD Komodo mining profit calculator
Using WhatToMine you can check, how profitable it is to mine selected altcoins in comparison to ethereum or bitcoin

[18-Sep-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is designed so that regardless of network hashrate, it doesnt attack the chain

[18-Sep-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Resistor Just make sure that your "publication" includes you saying:
` i'm not going to read a whitepaper`
and
`bunch of mombo jumbo
notaries
pfffft`
😉

[18-Sep-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont seem to want to understand that and just assume things

[18-Sep-18 12:23 PM] Resistor#1215
that is a profitability calculator

[18-Sep-18 12:23 PM] Resistor#1215
i'm talking about an official pool ist

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Resistor#1215
looks like the design doesn't work... because no blocks are found.

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you actually looked at the page he linked, there is a pool list

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Resistor#1215
i have 300 units mining to a pool right now

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Resistor#1215
not one block found in fucking 5 hours

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
blocks seem to be found every minute or so

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Resistor#1215
not on this pool that's why i initially asked for a fucking pool list

[18-Sep-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont manage pools

[18-Sep-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
300 units? and no blocks in 5 hrs? what are they CPUs?

[18-Sep-18 12:25 PM] Resistor#1215
no i seen this

[18-Sep-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
suprnova is finding blocks

[18-Sep-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
they seem to be a good pool

[18-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Resistor#1215
the screenshot of what i'm seeing is 98% of the nethash is controlled by nicehash or unknown pool.. idk which.  i was considering trying to balance this.

[18-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Resistor#1215
suprnova is a shit pool

[18-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Resistor#1215
i'm not going to mine where i have to make an account

What you're seeing is you assuming something without accepting the reality you're being told about

[18-Sep-18 12:28 PM] Resistor#1215
then if you don't need miners fuck it

[18-Sep-18 12:28 PM] Resistor#1215
wtf are you trying to prove anyway?

I realize that the entire space has created a ton of wealth, but by show of hands who believes that someone that says "f@(k...f@(k...f@(k...f@(k...n**ger..f@(k...f@(k...f@(k...f@(k..." has 300 ASICs @ $850 each ($255,000) + money to "invest"?
