@jl777c 
there seems to be a common theme here.
I stumbled over the transkript of a Christine Lagarde speech (that stylish IMF pony), and I really tried to follow her thoughts- but failed.
Here are some excerpts regarding esp. prIvacy/anonymity - this provides an intriguing perspective on the mindset.
And it is really fascinating to realize: these.people.have.no.clue.whatsoever. 
This is circular thinking at its best:

' ...  should central banks issue a new digital form of money? '
...
'This currency could satisfy public policy goals, such as (i) financial inclusion, and (ii) security and consumer protection; and to provide what the private sector cannot: (iii) privacy in payments.'
...
'c) Privacy

The third benefit of digital currency I would like to highlight lies in the privacy domain. Cash, of course, allows for anonymous payments. We reach for cash to protect our privacy for legitimate reasons: to avoid exposure to hacking and customer profiling, for instance.

Consider a simple example. Imagine that people purchasing beer and frozen pizza have higher mortgage defaults than citizens purchasing organic broccoli and spring water. What can you do if you have a craving for beer and pizza but do not want your credit score to drop? Today, you pull out cash. And tomorrow? Would a privately-owned payment system push you to the broccoli aisle?

Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency? Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals.'

Winds of Change: The Case for New Digital Currency

[23-Nov-18 08:00 AM] LocoMB#8593
...
'Central banks might design digital currency so that users’ identities would be authenticated through customer due diligence procedures and transactions recorded. But identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law. So when I purchase my pizza and beer, the supermarket, its bank, and marketers would not know who I am. The state might not either, at least by default.

Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the background. If a suspicion arose it would be possible to lift the veil of anonymity and investigate.

This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration.'
...
'The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation.'

Just wow, the really depressing thing is that this is likely completely palatable to the average citizen.

[23-Nov-18 08:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thanks for the rundown @LocoMB

[23-Nov-18 08:44 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Gov will have control as long as it controls properties ownership to calculate taxes. To be owner of a car or house you need to register it. When you register it it must be in line with taxes you pay. If you dont pay taxes and you have expensive things - they will investigate you and find out you got a lot from crypto (as example). Here does nto matter if it's private or not private. They can seize your devices and check what they like (you must be really well educated to know how to well encrypt your all devices and not make any mistakes on the way). So the privacy can be mostly against regular criminals, not against "state power/criminal " :pirate:

[23-Nov-18 09:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
We can assume most of society will accept taxes and state power over people, so this will likely never change.

[23-Nov-18 09:03 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
What it means it's highly possible banks will create it's own crypto. Not sure it will be generally accepted if will allow to much abuse (on demand money printing). This depend on society awareness and education. And here we come again to media / social media and democracy problems Verus is touching.

[23-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Zbouby#6066
The government can know if we own privacy coins ?

[23-Nov-18 09:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
no they can not, and that is what they do not understand

[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
They can know you own it, but can't know how much and what you do with it - if you are careful.

[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
But if it's significant amount they may know this all pointing gun to your face (or just putting in jail for few years)

Hey,

Komodo team is brainstorming new feature additions to Agama Wallet. Help us create the best multi-coin wallet for online payments and portfolio management.

Submit new user stories through the following link:

@Audo - added a ticket to be able to create a ticket within a wallet 😛

[23-Nov-18 09:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I know it may sound stupid - but from dev perspective - the more feedback from users the faster wallet will be polished.

[23-Nov-18 09:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
And the amount of feedback depends like all the rest - how easy it is for people to submit it.

[23-Nov-18 09:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Simplifying this for user - being able to send it directly from the wallet could make the process more interactive, reacher and faster.

[23-Nov-18 09:06 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Is there actually a "knowledge db / ticket db" for Agama? so that user could also see if a ticket was potentially already created and fixed in newer versions to avoid repetitive tickets ?

[23-Nov-18 09:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
It's good you are open to users, I see what is needed also to properly set the background for accepting ideas/tickets in an optimal way (process part of it automatically ). I hope I pictured this in above sentences.

true statement

[24-Nov-18 07:16 PM] Torankoku#4818
coinbase is a fiat onramp company. they are hampered by much more regulatory constraints than most exchanges out there. They probably have to deal with difficult on two levels: 1) making sure they meet all kyc/aml requirements for adding assets and 2) adding a different chain to their base (probably the reason why they can add ERC-20 tokens very readily compared to separate chains)

[24-Nov-18 07:16 PM] Torankoku#4818
or it could just be politics and a lack of awareness of kmd

[24-Nov-18 07:17 PM] Torankoku#4818
you'll be surprised at how many are actually aware of this project

[24-Nov-18 07:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
There is a lot of awareness, but very little acknowledgement.

[24-Nov-18 07:20 PM] Torankoku#4818

This isn't really the kind of market to anticipate dividends from anything crypto related @richardt

You have to be a full on crypto nerd to understand any of them. Where the fuck is crypto going? I guess coinbase decides.

Pay Taxes With Bitcoin? Ohio Says Sure

[26-Nov-18 08:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Ohio filers will technically send their tax payments to an Atlanta-based payments processor called BitPay, which will then convert the bitcoin to dollars for the state treasurer’s office.`
In reality, though, it's like a shop that says:
`We gladly accept €, if you send your € to a 3rd party who sends us £ instead (because we don't really want any €)`

[26-Nov-18 08:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They aren't accepting BTC, just accepting the ability to have a 3rd party pay USD on your behalf

Where do the rewards come from?

[27-Nov-18 12:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Hegelian when you make a transaction, there is a transaction fee, which is usually a small positive number. But if your funds have earned rewards, they will be added to that fee, such that the receiving address in the transaction receives more than was sent, a "negative fee" is added. That is how it works deep down

true value of kmd is said to be 51% attack protection; this is dependent on btc hashrate, no? then if hashrate goes down, risk of 51% goes up. in this scenario, what then is the value of kmd?
