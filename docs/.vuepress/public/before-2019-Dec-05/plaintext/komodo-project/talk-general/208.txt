$KMD has been in what seems to be an accumulation range for the last 200+ days. I think it is getting close to a breakout. Expecting a chain reaction that will lead to an impulsive move after the red block on 4H time frame is reclaimed.

@ca333  will there be a preliminary  mm2 GUI desktop release much earlier like a beta release ?                                               later this year is a long wait 😔

People keep trying to build Crypto trading/investing platforms

Give it a rest... we have enough

No-one uses them, they‘re just ‘me too’ products

Try building a game or a collectibles platform (i.e Crypto Kitties)

Inspire the masses instead of money grabbing

[12-Feb-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
well it did just come out this week

[12-Feb-19 07:08 PM] ca333#0118
@Holyfather3 we are working hard to deliver the best possible quality within the shortest possible timeframe. Rushing on this could in the end result in a bad user experience so we give it the time it needs and dont promise unrealistic timeframes. Like pointed out by @blackjok3r the key issues have been all resolved in the new MM2 (barterDEX v2) - it is like aforementioned pretty solid. We def. going to keep you all updated on progress.

[12-Feb-19 07:15 PM] ca333#0118
CC-Rogue "just" came out this week but it is already gaining a LOT of public attention. I believe it is the flagship showcase of Komodo Platforms capabilities. Keep in mind: If i told you 3 years ago that jl777 and KMD are going to create a Blockchain Platform in which you can play a game with a non-fungible token that equals a digital cryptographic collectible (similar to cryptokitties but obviously better) that can be traded through a cross-chain atomic swap protocol based decentralized exchange (compare it to your world of warcraft avatar that you could trade)  -  what would you have told me? I am crazy - right?

[12-Feb-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
well, we arent at the crosschain swapping of the nonfungibles yet

[12-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is no reason that cant be achieved if there is need for it

Hey ho, i heard binance will also launch a dex. Whats the difference to komodo Dex?

[13-Feb-19 04:00 PM] coingirl87#6489
Dont know what is the difference between on chain cex and komodo dex

[13-Feb-19 04:01 PM] jorian#4555
komodo dex transactions are direct swaps of 2 coins. on chain transactions need a 3rd chain to settle the transaction

[13-Feb-19 04:01 PM] jorian#4555
or use that 3rd chain for collateral

[13-Feb-19 04:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@coingirl87   Think like Waves or NXT Multigateway or Bitshares

[13-Feb-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
I pioneered that with MGW back in 2014

[13-Feb-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
NXT imploded itself, so bitshares was the only one really doing it until WAVES

[13-Feb-19 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
but still nobody is doing the multisig as far as I know and it all requires trusting a single issuer with all your coins

[13-Feb-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
###
looking for someone in the community to market the ROGUE chain, it will be a paid position. Since it combines an rpg which directly creates collectibles in addition to ingame gold become real ROGUE coins, it has a lot of unique aspects. It is a great proof of concept of blockchaining a deterministic random process, but it is also a pretty addictive game and could teach us more about how best to do such things
