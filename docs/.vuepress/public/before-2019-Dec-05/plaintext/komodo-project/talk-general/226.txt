Every time the bank sends us the ATM card it seems to have MasterCard or Visa on it  and every time we bring it back saying we don't want that feature.  It gets so old.    No one wants to deal in cash anymore.

When power goes out due to the big one,  people around here are going to not know what to do.

@Dr.Terminus Venezuela urging in a new bullrun is not probable

[06-Mar-19 04:34 PM] PTYX#6840
It comes down to stability and the ability for them to spend it on goods. That's still a long way from being practical in third world countries.

[06-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how about when another hyper inflated currency goes BTC.. then the next..

[06-Mar-19 04:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
nothing substantial enough without end user / consumer adoption and usage ?

[06-Mar-19 04:35 PM] PTYX#6840
VZ already has the highest BTC trading volume in Latin America

[06-Mar-19 04:36 PM] PTYX#6840
But think about how a farmer will pay for his rent or medical bills in crypto in a country where computers are still a novelty? There are technological hurdles for mainstream use. Even though a large amount of people already rely on crypto to transact.

Hi, when using BarterDEX, are there fees to pay through KMD coins ?

[06-Mar-19 05:00 PM] SHossain#0007
you pay fee with the coin you are trading with

[06-Mar-19 05:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
but the whole point of fiat not being backed by anything anymore is to create $$$ out of nothing, because wars are expensive

[06-Mar-19 05:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all money is created out of nothing right?

[06-Mar-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only sopund money would be something that accuratly tracks effort

[06-Mar-19 05:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, but before that pivotal point in financial history, wars needed to be paid for in gold or other materials that took effort and time to accumulate

[06-Mar-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
electricity seems to have some value

[06-Mar-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
those that say bitcoin has no value are saying electricity has no value (in addition to all the asics)

[06-Mar-19 05:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
1945 - present : korea, nam, gulf 1, gulf 2, somalia, lebanon, iraq, afghanistan, etc and those are only some of them where western forces were involved in

[06-Mar-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
what do they answer when asked about the value of the electricity needed to mine bitcoins?

[06-Mar-19 05:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
they probably don't know how much it costs to keep those btc miners running

[06-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the point is that this electricity is burned, unlike gold coins where the gold can be reused

[06-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, then the question about fiat being backed by nothing has to be sidestepped

[06-Mar-19 05:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ammount of energy spent is probably a more accurate description

[06-Mar-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
electricity used to mine btc would be similar to the man power required to mine the gold

[06-Mar-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`the only sopund money would be something that accuratly tracks effort`
`the only sopund money would be something that accuratly tracks energy spent`

[06-Mar-19 05:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
that man power was "burned" to create gold coins which could be reused, same with electricity being burned to mine crypto which is reused

[06-Mar-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
except the gold can be melted and extracted, cant extract the electricity from bitcoins, would be really cool if you could

[06-Mar-19 05:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
it would, but i would argue that the form under which the pretious material comes in is irelevant

[06-Mar-19 05:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
it was gold that was valuable, whether a coin or a bar... whether 0.1 btc or 1 btc 🤔

I bet goth type intellectuals would buy backlit xray images as "art" for a premium.  I will probably keep mining even at a loss, but in the winter it works. My ex is colorblind I'm sure Jl777 is a way better person :)

Supply/demand issues I assume ,  storing a reserve to back fiat in silver would require a lot of space and security among other things

[07-Mar-19 01:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The minimum “real”  value would fluctuate in that case.   Reminds of the issue going on with pennies right now, older pennies having more copper value than face value

`1) "the government issued 1 million more" would be difficult, would involve 1 million more grams of silver`
They jut claim "eminent domain" (or their equivalent) and take it from the citizenry to redistribute
While it doesn't inflate the supply, it does inflate the circulation

@TwilightPunkster K64 Can you explain what this is for us? It looks interesting so far!

[07-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I only know parts of the idea here so far. 😉

[07-Mar-19 02:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist that is an independent Unity RPC client for Komodo.

[07-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So it's for Unity to interact with komodo, correct?

[07-Mar-19 02:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
What this one is doing is requesting the data from cclib (crypto conditions smart contract that allows custom logic, in this case from Rogue) and returning a response in JSON which can be used in any possible way.

[07-Mar-19 02:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
It demonstrates that Unity can deal with Komodo easily.

[07-Mar-19 02:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, probably the first use case for game development will be to interact with TokenCC, which is essential for Asset Chain.

@Cryptofist also, that black thing is pretending to be a terminal, it can capture input and execute these RPC methods at runtime.
