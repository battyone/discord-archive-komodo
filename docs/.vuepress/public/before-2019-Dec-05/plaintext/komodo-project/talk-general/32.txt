fyi there's 0.5 ZILLA airdrops going on daily.  you just paste your KMD address  into #airdrop pretty good for a freebie, @PTYX has worked hard for the ecosystem over the years as support manager and has recently started a business offering services. 

good use of bot-tech to automate/integrate kmd blockchain.

Anyone an idea how much electricity or co2 release comes with each kmd transaction?

[20-Jul-18 03:28 PM] joe2x4#5987
Co2 release? Good grief. Co2 is literally required for plant growth. Plant growth is required for oxygen generation.

We all know ETC getting listed on coinbase.
Coinbase can now go ahead and acquire Keystone Capital and two other companies, as part of its strategy to list security tokens. Once this purchase and integration is complete, Coinbase will now be in a position to list tokens that come to the market through ICOs.

This move by Coinbase give a strategic edge to two cryptos that are listed on Coinbase, and that‚Äôs Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). These two cryptos are primarily used as platforms for the development and launch of ICOs.

[21-Jul-18 06:33 PM] yorklab#7270
I have been thinking about how Komodo would fit into this category. When exchanges are regulated they may NOT allow any token/coin that has the "private" capability.

[21-Jul-18 06:35 PM] yorklab#7270
I also wonder how many people really use Jumblr and if disabling that ability would be an option if deemed necessary. It will be interesting to see how this all plays out.

Japan is already banning these types of coins and I think the US will do the same when they start to regulate.

[21-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Hermes#6934
@Buddz1993  the soft launch was done on Monday

[21-Jul-18 07:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wasnt coinbase going to add zcash?

[21-Jul-18 07:29 PM] yorklab#7270
That was one they are exploring. I hope they do. That would give me a better feeling about the issue.

[21-Jul-18 07:33 PM] yorklab#7270
"Q: How will you decide what countries to launch these assets in?
Regional support will depend on a case-by-case analysis that looks to legal, compliance, and other factors that are relevant to that jurisdiction. In some cases, you should expect certain assets to be available in other jurisdictions before coming to the US."

So they could just block out certain countries.

[21-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Thank you üòâ

[21-Jul-18 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also privacy isn't completely frowned upon either .  I think Japan just went with a heavy handed approach.

[21-Jul-18 10:00 PM] yorklab#7270
Many may follow Japan's lead. Hopefully, my concerns are unwarranted.

[21-Jul-18 11:03 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
wouldnt it be favorable to have an overview of active devs and boardmembers with real names and pictures?

it might serve the anonymity but not trust

[21-Jul-18 11:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not a company

[22-Jul-18 12:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I don't see how they can ban it, torrent websites were banned here but I still use them all the time, as do plenty of others. Its a non issue for me really.

[22-Jul-18 12:32 AM] yorklab#7270
They can't stop it, but they can hurt it. If you're banned in more than a few places then it can make life difficult.

[22-Jul-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Atomic swap for a coin that's not banned, done

[22-Jul-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They can't do anything but bully people, if you don't let them bully you they have no power

[22-Jul-18 10:06 AM] ca333#0118
they can do everything, even banning it - but unless they realize they cant "control" it, they wont  since it would be counterproductive for "them". 
If you control 100% of the tech. infrastructure (ISP, DNS, etc.), 100% of the legal base/legislation, 100% of the currency that 99.9% of the crypto-hodlers trade crypto against, and and and. then well, why would you want to destroy or harm crypto as such - you already indirectly "control" it. 
So could be def. much more lucrative/target-aimed to instead take the control over of all the other underlying tech/base. 
"You can destroy something just by building up something else" - even very constructive energy that looks positive can result in huge destructive power and negative results.

[22-Jul-18 10:18 AM] sœÜldat#8733
They already created crypto-fiat and blocked-chain technologies with XRP

[22-Jul-18 10:36 AM] ca333#0118
exactly. and we all are still talking and talking about "mainstream adoption" - this word became the holy grail of blockchains PR bullshitting (sorry for wording). But who is doing it? We?  No - i dont think so - not we are bringing crypto and BC tech to the industry and wallstreet. Its quite the opposite... so it should also be pretty clear who is "controlling" the global cryptomarket.. not just from an eco perspective but also technical pov. as always - this are just my 2 subjective komodoshis.

Richlist for KMD and Assetchains: https://dexstats.info/richlist.php?asset=KMD
Richtlist Lookup for Address. It shows the Position of your address on the Richlist.  https://dexstats.info/richlistlookup.php?address=RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf

BTCH is missing for the moment as it pretty big.

[22-Jul-18 06:19 PM] frkrngl#2722
how many komodos we need for masternode?

[22-Jul-18 06:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are no masternodes @frkrngl

[22-Jul-18 06:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are Notary Nodes, but they require you to be voted into position. Voting happens once a year

[22-Jul-18 06:22 PM] frkrngl#2722
@xRobeSx  so they only minted if you keep them on wallet ! is that right

[22-Jul-18 06:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
You can get interest from holding in your wallet

[22-Jul-18 06:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
or you can mine KMD

[22-Jul-18 06:22 PM] frkrngl#2722
used to be masternode for komoda am i right

[22-Jul-18 06:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
No

[22-Jul-18 06:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there have been Notary Nodes

[22-Jul-18 06:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
it's different from masternodes

[22-Jul-18 06:23 PM] frkrngl#2722
what is the notery node?

[22-Jul-18 06:23 PM] frkrngl#2722
I never heard that before

[22-Jul-18 06:24 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Notary Nodes notarize the latest KMD blocks, onto Bitcoin blockchain, and notarize Assetchains onto KMD

[22-Jul-18 06:24 PM] frkrngl#2722
is there a link i can learn more

[22-Jul-18 06:25 PM] frkrngl#2722
so how can i attend to notary and when is the voting date for it

[22-Jul-18 06:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I don't have a link on hand, but I'm sure someone from the team has more info they can share

[22-Jul-18 06:25 PM] frkrngl#2722
ok thanks

[22-Jul-18 06:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Notary voting takes place in March (I think )

[22-Jul-18 06:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can't remember exactly the date, but it's definitely not until next year

[22-Jul-18 06:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Basically for every 1 KMD you own, everyone gets airdropped 1 vote coin. Then you can use your vote coins to vote for whichever candidate you'd like. or yourself

[22-Jul-18 06:29 PM] yorklab#7270
You can start on page 18 to learn about Notary Nodes::
