ah is that Zeltrex ? I don't know 100% if it's safe, it seems the vulnerability comes from an upstream library, so the safest way to secure your funds is using a paper/cold wallet

[05-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
idk it's called ZelCore wallet and looks like it's safe for now.

[05-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Catalyst#8405

yes it says so here

[05-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Catalyst#8405
actually it's syncing but i was abit confused as on the top of the wallet it says 
"This is a pre-release test build - use at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications:"

[05-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Catalyst#8405
hehe thanks @Cryptoon

Hey James, with price cc, can i long or short Amazon stocks with the price feed from the Oracle?

[05-Jun-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if AMZN is one of the supported oracles, yes

[05-Jun-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but i dont know the full list

[05-Jun-19 08:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well the price can be taken from Yahoo finance or something can it not?

[05-Jun-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
we already support most stocks, but it depends if the test chain is using it

[05-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
That is cool

[05-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

@Steelrat  read #officialüì¢

[05-Jun-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF is the sweep address, if your funds went there, fill out a claim form

[05-Jun-19 08:27 AM] t0sma#0368
@Steelrat I use Magnum Wallet with my ledger. Esay to use and claim rewards is available.

[05-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Steelrat#2421
@modereck  did, tried to move, but Agama wallet goes blank immediately, so I can do nothing with it. Would have to adress the chain from a new wallet, but I have no other fast option as far as I can see. Have a ledger, can installt

[05-Jun-19 08:27 AM] Steelrat#2421
ok, try Magnum wallet  someone got a secure link?

[05-Jun-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if your funds went to the sweep address, fill out a claim form ASAP

[05-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Yea they were probably

[05-Jun-19 08:39 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[05-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Buddz1993#5380
But the only affected is kmd

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I have the rest of the asset chains

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jorian#4555
no, all assetchains are affected

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
@Steelrat that was a tmp address, it went from there to the sweep address

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Buddz1993#5380
But the only thing missing is my kmd atm

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Buddz1993#5380
In my wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jorian#4555
yes, because the team has moved them for you

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
we did not sweep anything but the KMD

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Ahh I see ok .

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] Steelrat#2421
@jl777c so I use the form ? üòÉ

[05-Jun-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you will need to sweep any assetchain coins

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] jorian#4555
if you have REVS, DEX or CHIPS or anything else that you stored using Agama, you need to move them

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, use the form ASAP if you need to make a claim

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
**please pin the safe address that official team moved funds on**

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I will do this late afternoon

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
we need to relay that to every chat

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry about the hassle, but the alternative was that your KMD would just be gone, instead of being in the sweep address with a claim process

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll handle the french community

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Steelrat please check it again , your funds are moved to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF , which is the "safe" address

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] coyote#8010
Did you guys perform the sweep because an attacker was stealing funds?

[05-Jun-19 08:43 AM] coyote#8010
You can plead the fifth till later
