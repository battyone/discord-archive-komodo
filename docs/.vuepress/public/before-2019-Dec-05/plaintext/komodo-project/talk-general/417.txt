that binance is now collecting their rewards (which was counted in all of these "guaranteed to happen" funds) shows your claim to be, at best, inaccurate

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
again, you are wrong

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i just state that 75% of blocks should get 75% of rewards, over time

[04-Sep-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case the 3 KMD block reward and unclaimed interest rewards

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is claimed, it isnt part of the mining rewards

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it does make the entire issue a lot smaller issue

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, I'm wrong....
do enlighten me how you plan to get their new funds away from them to balance out "75%" of previously unclaimed funds....

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont plan on any such thing

[04-Sep-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think year to date, the numbers are already getting closer to the 75%

[04-Sep-19 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes....
by using methods to ensure that they are not randomly distributed among all active miners

[04-Sep-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry that your sniping pool isnt getting the results it used to

[04-Sep-19 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sorry that your sniping pool isnt getting the results it used to`
I don't have one, never did 
but thanks again for using theory over facts

[04-Sep-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i still claim 75% should get 75%

[04-Sep-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and YTD i believe it is now closer to 75% than it used to be

[04-Sep-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the facts are the actual rewards over time, before it was statistically significantly less than 75%. we have corrected that but i havent seen the latest numbers to know if it has been fully balanced yet or not. but with much less unclaimed rewards, it seems hard to make up for all the past imbalance

[04-Sep-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
you might not have  a sniping pool, but you represented their interests vocally, for thousands of posts

[04-Sep-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we just need to agree to disagree that 75% of blocks should get 75% of rewards

[04-Sep-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
let me know when we get above 75%

[04-Sep-19 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you might not have a sniping pool, but you represented their interests vocally, for thousands of posts`
I represent the interest of **all** miners (as a NN it's in my financial best interest to agree with you *and* do my own thing too, but I obviously do not do that)
This all came about because NNs were upset about an unknown miner (dubbed "gigapool") that appears to be using an effective profit switcher and doing the exact same thing
`for thousands of posts` I asserted that both NNs and "gigapool" doing so gives vested miners effectively 0% of these funds (unless they mine in luckpool only, then they have about 1% for much more than 1% of blocks)
This whole "75 for 75" is only about the greed of NNs and refuses to balance out **for all miners**

[04-Sep-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i suggest that the rest of miners complain to gigapool

[04-Sep-19 12:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
Calling the actions of jl777 "greedy" does not match up with my experience of reality

[04-Sep-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i feel that NN are entitled to 75% of blocks and 75% of rewards and if it deviates significantly from that, it is like a bug that should be fixed.

[04-Sep-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there shouldnt be any large controversy over this

[04-Sep-19 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Calling the actions of jl777 "greedy" does not match up with my experience of reality`
Duke, try not to take a single contextual statement and apply it as a blanket 🤦🏽

[04-Sep-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and this extra from the hunting is very important subsidy during these low KMD price period for NN

[04-Sep-19 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and this extra from the hunting is very important subsidy during these low KMD price period for NN`
Yes, Kamerad
_wanders off to have a meaningful conversation that will not go in circles with misrepresentations..._

[04-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Audo#5667
why is there such a large debate about this? I still don't quite get what it is about and I sense I am not really missing on anything. :/

[04-Sep-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only a few NN that disagree

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but they tend to be very vocal about it

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] PTYX#6840
The majority agree

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
90%+ of the NN are not having any issues and in fact are very appreciative of the entire thing

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] Audo#5667
100% consensus is impossible, seems everything is fine

[04-Sep-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but the vocal minority feel that they need to make their point, hundreds of times

[04-Sep-19 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it is only a few NN that disagree`
There's more than a few, but between 2 people controlling the purse strings and misc threats (be they financial or otherwise), they dare not make those dissents known outside of DMs
My life would be much easier if they'd stop living scared and grew a backbone

[04-Sep-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are claiming the majority of the NN agree with you and not me?

[04-Sep-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
we had a vote and it was very one sided

[04-Sep-19 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
TLDR: Big blocks are so contentious because there is the potential to "win big" for a few miners, and so whoever gets them either makes bank or "loses out", hence all the contention. Most NNs now agree on James' approach, but we have a few that still feel something better should be done. Our new approach helps me pay my bills, so I am thankful for it.

@Audo maybe that helps

[04-Sep-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no other viable proposal on the table that i have seen and since vast majority of NN are ok with the current, it seems pointless to continue discussing this

[04-Sep-19 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure it's a majority, but I'm sure that it's more than "a few" and if some of them spoke in front of others and not just in DMs, the dynamic *might change*

[04-Sep-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, my controversial "75% of blocks should get 75% of rewards" will continue create controversy and the need for "governance"

[04-Sep-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I agree with you that things are not perfect, but I don't see a better solution being proposed

{Reactions}
👆 

[04-Sep-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems to mean, "decide things in my favor"

[04-Sep-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
a vote was made within the NN as this was an issue internal to the NN.

[04-Sep-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but I don't see a better solution being proposed`
Here's a solution:
mine the blocks you're "supposed to mine" and let the random transactions happen in the random block they're supposed to be in be mined by who mines it (you know, like mining normally happens when you can't manipulate the probability of getting a specific block)

[04-Sep-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont expect many would be advocating that NN shouldnt get 75% of the mining rewards.

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
"supposed to mine" would be controlled by the blockchain consensus code, right?

[04-Sep-19 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i dont expect many would be advocating that NN shouldnt get 75% of the mining rewards.`
again, this is stated as a conflation
exactly 0 people have ever said that shouldn't be, this is a whole other thing

[04-Sep-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a vote was made within the NN as this was an issue internal to the NN.`
the vote was made about how to disperse the funds after you decreed that they would be hunted
another conflation

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm

[04-Sep-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
hunting was already happening, nothing i could do to stop it

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so i made a system that minimized the negative impact and maximized the positive

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of just complaining that it is unfair

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
the existing blockchain consensus rules were not changed

[04-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Mylo#8306
your last statement is correct CG.  however, the probability is no longer random because of "gigapool".  this led to eratic mining by some NNs, which from this no-longer-random-gigapool anomaly, would not have been the "standard" way. 
the "hunting" was created, so the erratic mining _greedy_ nature of mining big rewards, was contained to the "hunting miners" to compete against gigapool.   all notary mining is then not-erratic.   and the anomaly of big rewards is working - meaning that the chain doesn't suffer from erratic mining.

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
75% of rewards is the targeted amount

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Mylo#8306
previous to last now.

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nothing i could do to stop it`
anyone that believes that you are powerless to stop any given NN activity is a feken idiot
and on that note, I'm off to work

[04-Sep-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i have no special powers and it is proven that people are free to accuse me of lying, cheating, and worse

@CrisF you're in the channel and quite able to scroll back to see it there

This issue has been a dead horse being kicked for 3 months, let it rest, for now anyway. If somebody comes up with an awesome new idea that is better, plz bring it forward.

[04-Sep-19 12:58 PM] CrisF#3405
@@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Yes, I was there at the time.
Decree is a strong word to me though and I didn't feel it as such.
Feel so because I saw alternative suggestions solicited multiple times. 
There were a few that were rejected by group vote.

@CrisF feel fee to link me to these "group votes" that I missed and more than 20% of NNs participated in....

[04-Sep-19 01:02 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm  not saying everyone was there to vote, but both you and I were.

[04-Sep-19 01:03 PM] CrisF#3405
I can check for it when back on pc.

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't think that is a particularly effective vote method.

[04-Sep-19 01:04 PM] CrisF#3405
I have proposed something for situations like that.

[04-Sep-19 01:05 PM] CrisF#3405
But there was something done with the people there who wanted to participate.

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] CrisF#3405
I don't have suggestions to offer on a mining/hunting solution. I don't have the  knowledge. I do have a suggestion on a mechanism to resolve the matter that may be more effective than present.

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] CrisF#3405
Using that I believe I could gain enough info and the ability express that is a more effective manner.

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @dukeleto, I might react diferently, but I don't particularly like feeling decreed to either.

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] CrisF#3405
That's probably why a lot of us ended up here, haha.

[04-Sep-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
I remember about 40 total votes, which is a lot more than 20%

[04-Sep-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i only stated the obvious, that hunting was happening and there was no practical way to stop it

[04-Sep-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so in my opinion, the best way was to create a hunting pool

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
we voted on how best to split the proceeds and between allocating to NN and donating to the hack sweep address, got about 90% of the votes

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the current solution in place is following that vote outcome

[04-Sep-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
only the small minority against this are still complaining to this day

[04-Sep-19 01:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

but the ones that didnt get their way feel a need to stir things up again. i specifically didnt mention names of who was opposed to this to protect their chances of reelection, but i cant prevent it if they repeat the same stuff all over again

[04-Sep-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I remember about 40 total votes, which is a lot more than 20%`
again, a conflation, that vote was:
"please vote what hunting pool should do with revenues:"

[04-Sep-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
you suggest that the team needed permission to setup a hunting pool where they donate 90% of the proceeds?

[04-Sep-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
why should there be a vote on that?

[04-Sep-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not going to keep rehashing this to any further ad nauseum than we already have, I'm merely pointing out the conflation and/or misrepresentation 
`they donate 90% of the proceeds`
if you're "donating" 90% of it to NNs, they they aren't really getting what they "deserve", they are getting a "bonus" that depends on your grace and will 🤷🏽

[04-Sep-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i have the right to donate funds, or are you saying that i need some permission from you or the voting?

[04-Sep-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and if i am managing the donations, then i seem to have the right to determine how it is donated, due to the golden rule

[04-Sep-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i have the right to donate funds, or are you saying that i need some permission from you or the voting?`
I'm saying that you represent this as NNs getting what they "deserve" and the 2 are not the same thing (not even in the same hemisphere)

[04-Sep-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you continue this? it has already wasted many hours of my time. you continue to disrupt

[04-Sep-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
again, you are wrong, because both can be true

[04-Sep-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the funds come from the 75%, it is then uses as an incentive bonus
