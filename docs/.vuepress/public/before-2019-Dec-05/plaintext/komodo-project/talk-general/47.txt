I feel the urge to diversify my holdings.. have like bit over 500 kmd.. now mining metaverse.. 
Wrong right? üòê

[17-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
mine metaverse, sell it and buy KMD üòÑ

[17-Aug-18 08:32 PM] shnu#0359
And since you are here.. you might as well sell metaverse on BarterDEX.

[17-Aug-18 08:34 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
That coin can go x100 .. will keep what i mine.. sold too many in the past..

Hey guys, I was wondering, what is Komodo's country of origin?

[18-Aug-18 08:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
what is Bitcoin country of origin?

[18-Aug-18 08:32 PM] Nickel#2022
That's not my question, but if you would like an answer: Bitcoin's country of origin is unknown since Satoshi Nakamoto hasn't been indentified. Some think Bitcoin was invented in the United Kingdom, while others believe that it is of Asian origin.

The MGNX testing PoS asset chain has been started for a 3rd time. Chain 1 and 2 testers have been compensated and should expect to see their coins within 8hrs. 
```./komodod -ac_name=MGNX -ac_supply=12465001 -ac_staked=90 -ac_reward=2000000000 -ac_halving=525960 -ac_cc=2 -ac_end=2629800 -addnode=45.76.32.178```

It's a  Komodo asset chain. For now can only use the cli wallet, but in future updates will get added to the Agama desktop wallet.

You might run a old komodod on windows

Hi. Just logged onto my Agma wallet for first time in a few months and for whatever reason it's unable to reach the server. I went to settings and SPV and tried changing server and i continued getting the unreachable error message. Any ideas?

[20-Aug-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
update it, the SPV servers changed

[20-Aug-18 01:58 AM] kBone#9115
thanks

[20-Aug-18 02:01 AM] kBone#9115
When I get to the re installation detected do I leave the settings alone, and allow it to uninstall but don't delete any info?

[20-Aug-18 02:19 AM] PTYX#6840
I usually delete all app binaries but don't delete any wallet files

[20-Aug-18 02:19 AM] PTYX#6840
If you are using native always backup the wallet.dat before updating

[20-Aug-18 02:20 AM] kBone#9115
the 2 options are user data and zcash params do I want to delete those? Either way I am uninstalling correct?

[20-Aug-18 02:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@kBone Just choose "Re-install current version", those options are active only for "Uninstall" option

[20-Aug-18 02:22 AM] kBone#9115

üëå 

[20-Aug-18 02:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Be sure that you made a backup of wallet.dat in case of native mode usage (location of wallet.dat in different OS: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/192675854/Location+of+Wallet.dat+File) 
And control your seed in case of SPV mode usage

[20-Aug-18 02:29 AM] kBone#9115
Thank you. So when it asks if i want to " uninstall agama and all it modules?" I say no?

[20-Aug-18 02:29 AM] kBone#9115
@TonyL

[20-Aug-18 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@kBone You have to press "Yes" because installer first uninstall old version and then installation package will install the new one

[20-Aug-18 02:30 AM] kBone#9115
ok

[20-Aug-18 02:38 AM] kBone#9115
worked well. Thanks for info
