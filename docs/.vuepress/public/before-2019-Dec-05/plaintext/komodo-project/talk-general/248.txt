Man, I was just about to finish reading his bullshittery and you banned him lol. I was enjoying watching how much of an ass he was making of himself

[01-Apr-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
they are actually trying to get people here to invest in the IEO so they can dump their bags

[01-Apr-19 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
gl with that, I can't see anyone but n00bs doing so

[01-Apr-19 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
people will loose their funds if they invest. sounds like another bitconnnneeecccttt scam

I have decided to not cast any votes for candidates that promise to use NN revenues as bribes to get votes

[01-Apr-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I suggest everybody do the same and vote based on technical competence

[01-Apr-19 11:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbt, I'd much rater not get the job because 31 people convinced voters that they are better suited/knowledgeable than because of who is/isn't "liked"

Komodo KMD can find a way to increase the speed of transactions to Visa level while maintaining the POW uses Asset chains. The ability to use as a payment system in couple with advanced Komodo technologies will have an explosive effect. $KMD #paysystem

Any chance who ever's running this page <https://komodoelection.com/candidates/> can update to include the candidates who have submitted their proposals to Github? <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes>

Komodoelection.com is a pretty great page to direct people towards on social media, just need candidates updated to make it more complete.

[02-Apr-19 11:17 AM] jorian#4555
i think something like that is being worked on

[02-Apr-19 11:17 AM] jorian#4555

Marketing guys wanted to make website, but I warned that will be hard time parsing inside github proposals

[02-Apr-19 11:20 AM] kolo#1111
Any website this year is unofficiall attachment to nn repo

[02-Apr-19 11:21 AM] kolo#1111
Most proposals were submitted just in last day

[02-Apr-19 11:22 AM] kolo#1111
We were accused last year in doing central candidates list and this way limiting candidates on our wish. That’s not true, but no lists this year

[02-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay, so if someone were to ask where they can find a list of candidates, which is usually what is asked, do I just direct them towards that github?

[02-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Regnar#6164
also I guess my question still stands, whoever is running komodoelection,com (assuming it's a 3rd party and not official) any chance they would be willing to update that list, or at least link to the NN repo?

Holy shit that looks nice

Hm does mobile dex mean instead of keeping barterdex open on pc 24/7

[02-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
A phone which is always on and always connected to the net anyway

[02-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Meaning much easier liquidity

[02-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And much easier order matching

[02-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
😮

[02-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[02-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also, no need to split utxo or need to have knowledge of the backend protocols to make it work.

Mobile DEX alpha looks awesome! I guess my question Is this. How long could it take to get your order matched? Hours? Minutes? Seconds?

[02-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Alecandro#1179
It’s kinda like putting out a super specific limit order right?

[02-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Acura#2748
i think depends on the Blockchain from the traded coin

[02-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Alecandro#1179
Hmmm interesting. That is so cool though wow. Can’t wait to try

[02-Apr-19 02:47 PM] kolo#1111
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 it’s just a page. We will see in following year how this naming scheme helps

[02-Apr-19 02:48 PM] kolo#1111
I’m tired to repeat this pages are not elections thing, it’s node main page forever after

[02-Apr-19 02:48 PM] kolo#1111
We can ask for json file anytime later

[02-Apr-19 02:48 PM] kolo#1111
In node directory

[02-Apr-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I meant to the proposal repo
```JSON
[
  {
    "name": "ComputerGenie",
    "region running for": {
      "EU": true,
      "NA": true,
      "SH": true,
      "AR": false

  }

[02-Apr-19 02:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464

VERIBLOCK looks really fishy- they brag in the bitcointalk OP that 'it has been in development for three years' 
such claim is sort of ludicrous, very questionable

[02-Apr-19 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Markus that could be a bug in software, or people storing data directly in the place where addresses should go, or a few other things

[02-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464
@dukeleto  ok thx

[02-Apr-19 04:21 PM] LocoMB#8593
like - being in stealth mode from mid 2015 to mid 2018?!? no way, this is a spurious claim, the sort of loud-mouthed bragging snake oil salesman use

[02-Apr-19 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody stored the original BTC PDF as a multisig transaction long ago, directly in the place where addresses should go. So it looks like garbage to an explorer

[02-Apr-19 04:25 PM] LocoMB#8593
'After Nearly Three Years of Development, We're Thrilled' ... super secret dev in our basement, too dangerous and powerful to talk about? no, just plain marketing trash claims

[same goes for the source code, we can not release that, would be irresponsible]

[02-Apr-19 04:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
at least ~2 years is true, I remember reading about it

[02-Apr-19 04:27 PM] LocoMB#8593
the OP on Bitcointalk is from 2018 - so they talked about it before?

[02-Apr-19 04:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
can't remember exactly, but it was before the bull started in 2017

[02-Apr-19 04:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
