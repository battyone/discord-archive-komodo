[07-Mar-19 06:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
310,41 USD  NEO
310,94 USD  KMD

[07-Mar-19 06:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
KMD is the clear choice

[07-Mar-19 06:13 AM] wolfgang#3508
lol

[07-Mar-19 06:13 AM] wolfgang#3508
technically 0.08btc worth into one of the two

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
don't forget the 5.1%

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
5.1%?

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
Reward per year on KMD

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
yah

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
I also have a few asics mining kmd

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
thing is neo emits gas

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
which I convert back to neo

[07-Mar-19 06:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
Im massively keen on kmd though

[07-Mar-19 06:15 AM] wolfgang#3508
Im only 20% of the way there to my goal on kmd

[07-Mar-19 06:15 AM] wolfgang#3508
and have only bought back 30% of my bags in neo

[07-Mar-19 06:15 AM] wolfgang#3508
so a long way to go on both üòÇ

[07-Mar-19 06:16 AM] wolfgang#3508

[07-Mar-19 06:16 AM] wolfgang#3508

[07-Mar-19 06:34 AM] zaycash#5031

yes, I figured, but I didn't link anything to anything, so I hope these fine people didn't lose their Komodo by being nice

[07-Mar-19 09:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[07-Mar-19 09:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup, and I don't like it

[07-Mar-19 09:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, they have been saying that since last year

[07-Mar-19 09:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Maxim (CEO) actually said from september every day that the SDK was going to Asset Store.

[07-Mar-19 09:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
To be honest, its not going to be fun.

[07-Mar-19 09:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[07-Mar-19 09:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
But they have millions already

[07-Mar-19 09:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
well I love a good train wreck

[07-Mar-19 09:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
It will be interesting to see how the ethereum network holds up

[07-Mar-19 09:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Possibility of turing complete conditions sets creation + easy to use "blockchain web-server" komodod with human readable RPC calls and usual JSONs as output. Seems like a dev kit already üòÇ

{Reactions}
Komodo (2) 

[07-Mar-19 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Can use anything you want to call rpc

[07-Mar-19 09:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@actionslacks they have sidechains

[07-Mar-19 09:50 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but the ethereum network is fragile

[07-Mar-19 09:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
however don't worry too much, most games are horrible

[07-Mar-19 09:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I do like the one from one of my friends though

[07-Mar-19 09:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but when I earned my own lambo, I can call him and convert him xD

[07-Mar-19 09:51 AM] Alright#0419
might have misunderstood what you meant by web-server, the thing is interesting though. @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  made it

[07-Mar-19 09:51 AM] altcoinist#1501
Wil there be another application for mobile dex?

[07-Mar-19 09:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's in testing @altcoinist

[07-Mar-19 09:53 AM] altcoinist#1501
Thx

[07-Mar-19 09:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
limitation of oracle.earth at the moment is that it's just a single node, and all the valueless coins belong to the host, so user would need to setup their own to use for real movement of funds.

[07-Mar-19 09:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
between django and the python rpcs, interfacing with a chain from the browser is doable, but security is questionable for anything of value. I'm curious if gateways CC will overcome this, but I'm still testing

[07-Mar-19 10:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
fwiw, the data stored in this oracle is periodic data from RCPs (getinfo & coinsupply) - http://oracle.earth/oracle_samples/?chain=CFEKORKL&oracletxid=04e8098d746bd8877347b8188b70d87cb7811b7ec902c2bd92970dd37b9ac093&batonutxo=a6bc4ca5eba714a72e8c203b85a8e4ce867e2dd59017ccdb7f075746c19a98c9&num=20

[07-Mar-19 10:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
It'll populate a graphs once I have a chance to parse the json the way it needs to be done to link into chart.js

[07-Mar-19 10:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once that is done, another will be setup for KMD assetchains, and twitbot to indicate notarisation lags
