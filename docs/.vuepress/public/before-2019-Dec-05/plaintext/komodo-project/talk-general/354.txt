to be clear, if your address had less than 777 KMD swept, and you didnt receive a refund, but you received the dust to the old address. the holdup for the refund is the transaction you need to send from the old address to the new address: 

https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

I will run the refund processor daily for a while, so if you dont get your tx done before i start the refund processor, you will need to wait another day. Also if you have a larger amount, we need to wait a bit more time to make sure there are no disputes. and if your funds were not swept, but stolen, you need to wait and additional week.

it does take a long time to run the refund processor as i didnt code it for efficiency. i will process progressively larger and larger amounts during the week and will post the most recent cutoff value. that way you dont have to keep asking when your refund will be processed. until you send in your dust tx from old address to new address and i process refunds bigger than your refund, your refund wont be processed.

i really apologize to everyone that you had to go through this. i take full responsibility. there really is no excuse, other than i didnt really pay close attention to the GUI side of things as i only do cli. still, this is clearly insufficient and we have learned a very expensive lesson.

all assetchains has their own claim form now. users who claimed assetchains before these new forms, don't need to do anything. these forms are only for users who didn't send their claim yet

[09-Jun-19 11:41 AM] gobi#1545
that's the opposite of what james and I were discussing yesty unfort. We were discussing having a single form that allows for sweeping all associated assets in that account without needing to fill out multiple forms for a single account

[09-Jun-19 11:42 AM] gobi#1545
not sure if that's a possibility

[09-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Pwnz#4150
I claimed in the first hours and sent the small amount and am under 7777 , but haven't received the funds on the new wallet. anyway to verify with someone?

[09-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Pwnz#4150
or should i just wait patiently? üòÉ

[09-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
have you sent the verification tx to the new address?

[09-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Pwnz now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done.

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So once you see a small tx come in on your old address, use that small amount and send it to your new address so you can prove you owned the old wallet and want it to go to the new wallet.

[09-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Pwnz#4150
yep, i sent the small amount to my new address

[09-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Pwnz#4150
i was curious if all refunds go in the same batch of if it would take some time

[09-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
when did you send it? recently or few days ago? There might be a conflict or if recently it is possible you didnt make the daily cutoff as jl posted earlier

[09-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Pwnz#4150
7th June

[09-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
did you update the form in between? Or maybe the amount entered didnt correspond 100% with the amount swept

[09-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Pwnz#4150
I didn't update the form

[09-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm best to wait for someone of the team handling the claims to weigh in then

[09-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Pwnz#4150
That's why I was asking if need to run a verification in DM cos I think I was in the first hundreds to fill the form.

[09-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362

if you have sent all your funds to the new address and you didnt receive a refund yet, that means you missed yesterdays cutoff, or it is disputed (likely if you claimed more than once)

when under 77777?

[09-Jun-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
about 20% have received refunds, but weighed to the smaller ones so only about $1 mil worth is returned. we are ahead of the June 15th schedule by almost a week. for those that did not receive refunds yet, make sure to follow the instructions. any address with any controversy has not been processed yet. i see a lot of people made many claims for the same address and that triggered a disputed flag, ie. delayed
