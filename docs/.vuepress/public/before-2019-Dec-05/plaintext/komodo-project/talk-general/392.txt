One of the reasons my gold stays in the vault is due to the cost of moving it. Plus, privacy is a combination of things. Not necessarily the transaction itself. Gold works for small quantities and special occasions but not as an everyday vehicle to "retain" your privacy.

State of the ETH report: I've been messing around today with ETH dapps to see what's out there these days, since there is so much ongoing dapp development and people are making neat stuff. Bottom line is that transaction fees remain absurd.  To send funds between my own wallets, a common occurrence when you're playing around, cost me eleven cents. Making a trade on kyber cost me two dollars!! To use uniswap so I could onboard at synthetix cost me eighty seven cents! Seems their model is busted!. UXs are great tho! All on mobile using Trust Wallet.

[11-Jul-19 07:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
the high fees are the feature, because they add value right?

Just did a transaction using shiftly which is a dapp to get the best rates and fees for decentralized trading - got a thirty five cent fee. But when the transaction stayed pending I checked the expected confirm time - seven hours and eleven minutes!!

[11-Jul-19 08:08 PM] allbits#5898
Amazing to see so many smart capable people working so hard on a platform which is demonstrably unusable. They better hope sharting works!

ok so i messed up, i've deleted my wallet.dat from komodo ocean folder

[11-Jul-19 08:23 PM] SpraY#9508
i've imported the privatekey to a newly created wallet, as balance didn't show on my original wallet.dat

[11-Jul-19 08:24 PM] SpraY#9508
but i forgot that without the coin control it sends to another change address

[11-Jul-19 08:25 PM] SpraY#9508
i completely forgot that it doesn't remain on the original address that i used with the importprivkey command, so i shift+del deleted the komodo folder from the Appdata/Roaming/Komodo folder.I'm kinda freaking out right now and trying to find something to recover data from SSD

[11-Jul-19 08:25 PM] SpraY#9508

goddamn qt wallet with their change address

[11-Jul-19 08:59 PM] SpraY#9508
should've just had default option to keep imported address in coin control, not send the remaining to another address...

[11-Jul-19 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
start QT wallet with `-pubkey` option and all change will go to same address

[11-Jul-19 09:01 PM] SHossain#0007
example start command `./komodo-qt-linux -pubkey=020aab8308d4df375a846a9e3b1c7e99597b90497efa021d50bcf1bbba23246527 &`

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....

I just created a new website, Privacy Alternatives - it's a directory for privacy tools.
Part of it is dedicated to crypto and I also included many projects from Komodo (ARRR, Barterlly, Zaddex, AtomicDex, Veruscoin and also Pungo, Ocean, AgamaVerus, Chameleon wallets)
Feel free to suggest anything else that could be added there and also Like your favourite projects...listings with more likes go to the top of the list (you can give a Like to more than one project, but only 1 Like per day for each project). 
Hope you like it and find some useful tools there:
