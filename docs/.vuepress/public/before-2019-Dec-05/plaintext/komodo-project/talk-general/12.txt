that's also what he told me in his comment, I request him to write a longer article about Komodo but he refused, I was not following during the Komodo ICO so I don't know what exactly happened but this is what he said  " I regretfully made some public comments around the time of the ICO launch which might have limited the size of the participation in the ICO and that may have temporarily strained my relationship with @jl777. So I don‚Äôt want to repeat that by writing anything about that could cause any damage to it"

[23-Jun-18 01:32 AM] Tort#9226
what is the significance of that?

[23-Jun-18 01:54 AM] riseandfall#3726
That KMD will implement smart contracts and that these smart contracts are "cross chains"...

[23-Jun-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It means we can scale because you can use a cluster of chains instead of a single chain like ETH.

[23-Jun-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Im sure the real uses of this tech have not even been thought of yet. We can transfer coins across chains to enable a national currency solution but you could use it for anything.

[23-Jun-18 02:06 AM] riseandfall#3726
BTW, I hear more and more some people complaining thar tokens (considered as security tokens) are not tradeable on famous exchanges...Why they don't switch to BarterDEX!!

Id like to see ravencoin RVN easier to use on Barterdex. There are a lot of miners out there and the only one main buggy exchange.  It seems like its a real pain to get it to work on Barterdex and I have not figured it out yet.

Just read: Komodo is officially interoperable! I saw a couple of other projects trying to do this.  Does anyone have knowledge of Fusion and Metronome and how they are different?

[23-Jun-18 07:54 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
then there's that "Alliance" Icon, Aion, Wanchain.  But I think they are only interoperable exclusively between themselves.
