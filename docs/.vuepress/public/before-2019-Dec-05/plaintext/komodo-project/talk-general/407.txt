Looks like @coinbase is going to auto-liquidate all $ZEC owned by UK customers, and close accounts!
This adds massive sell pressure to Zcash the short-term, in addition to the pressure of new Equihash ASIC owners (A9++/Z11) trying to pay off their rigs. https://t.co/alqK4Z...

Not sure if it's related, but Coinbase is liquidating UK customer ZEC balances. Seems that UK financial laws are not compatible with Zcash

[09-Aug-19 06:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is z?

[09-Aug-19 10:34 PM] rainbro7#4735
K64 a scam? What is happening?

[09-Aug-19 10:36 PM] rainbro7#4735
No real information

[09-Aug-19 10:36 PM] rainbro7#4735
On anything... just hype and buzzwords

[09-Aug-19 10:37 PM] rainbro7#4735
I'll give their graphics teams and game developers some credit... beyond that... idk

[09-Aug-19 10:37 PM] rainbro7#4735
Not invested, just watched a youtube vid and found Sam to be a little strange.

[09-Aug-19 10:54 PM] PTYX#6840
@rainbro7 how so?

[09-Aug-19 11:55 PM] rainbro7#4735
Everything is extremely ambiguous

[09-Aug-19 11:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
I too can say that I have acquired $30M+ in funding from a top gaming company. I will be using a new cutting edge algorithm that others have never heard before. It will allow for decentralized identities that are provable and verifiable while maintaining privacy. These identities will be used to prevent multiple account that can cause issues like in gods unchained - a coinbase gaming project. Throw in some fancy graphics and done. My point is an idea and talk don't mean much they haven't elaborated on methods or the investor.

[09-Aug-19 11:59 PM] rainbro7#4735
NDA.... oh man

[10-Aug-19 12:04 AM] Alecandro#1179
Just so you know theyâ€™re planning to have GS do their press release in the next week hopefully, then everyone can be assured of their claims of the funding

[10-Aug-19 12:06 AM] bishop#9773
@Alecandro They've planned a lot of stuff, but know that if they fail this deadline, it's going to use up all of their clout

them saying they're focused on gameplay *then* blockchain stuff is entirely backwards

[10-Aug-19 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
It will not work.

[10-Aug-19 12:09 AM] bishop#9773
Them discussing development without funding is another issue

[10-Aug-19 12:10 AM] bishop#9773
aspirational goals of like 40 games by end of 2020, come on

[10-Aug-19 12:12 AM] Alright#0419
gameplay then blockchain focus makes me think it will simply be centralized game servers that award coins as they validate gameplay

[10-Aug-19 12:12 AM] Alright#0419
without designing the game from the ground up with blockchain in mind, the gameplay validation simply cannot be trustless

[10-Aug-19 02:30 AM] PTYX#6840
I wonder if it's Goldman Sachs directly or a subsidiary branch or some third party fund related to gs

[10-Aug-19 02:31 AM] PTYX#6840
I'll give the K64 team the benefit of the doubt. If they indeed get funding from GS then that's pretty big.

Hello, I don't understand all recent tweets and announcements, is K64 still worth investing ? Why does KMD gets so much hate and goes down so much... Is dukeleto a real ecosystem supporter ? I'm really worried about such attacks on Verus, what is happening here?

DYOR, dont rely on others to tell you what to invest in. Either way, dont invest more than you can afford.
not sure about the hate, I didnt see it. Did see price fall tho, could be delayed as we didnt fall alongside other alts earlier. 
@dukeleto is a fictional character in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. He is also the founder of HUSH, an elected notary node operator, and donated NN earnings to K64 earlier, which could be seen as supporting the ecosystem (though I think he's questioning the decision of that generosity). You'll have to ask him about the Verus Beef, I have no idea.
There's lots happening here. A new version of atomicDEX beta was just released, NSPV is being worked on, a new difficulty adjustment algo to mitigate block stranding from massive hash has been created, Antara composer is online,  the modules are being expanded, #kmdlabs is testing improvements to dPoW, and an API to source ecosystem coin stats is under development. There's more, but you'll have to check out some other channels.

I'm just laughing at the prices of alts these days

[10-Aug-19 09:05 AM] MetaJames#2985
I should have been a simpleton and kept BTC

[10-Aug-19 09:06 AM] MetaJames#2985
The prices are offensive actually

[10-Aug-19 09:06 AM] MetaJames#2985
Far below intrinsic values

[10-Aug-19 09:06 AM] bluewh#7644
but releasing seems not to make KMD worth any value, all alts dropping... but KMD far more...

[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] MetaJames#2985
Just glad I learned to invest way less in alts a while back

[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] MetaJames#2985
Paying off right now

[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
@bluewh do you suggest we stop all work on the new tech?

[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe pay $4 mil we dont have for lunches that we dont do

[10-Aug-19 09:09 AM] bluewh#7644
the berterdex is good but I do not understand why KMD is slammed hard

[10-Aug-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine a motorboat that is dragging along a lot of waterskiers

[10-Aug-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
some start falling, and then soon all are fallen down

[10-Aug-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
does the exact depth of how far each waterskier is underwater during the turbulent time mean so much?

[10-Aug-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC being the motorboat, and the other coins the waterskiers

[10-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
all the prices are compressed, a 10% gain is 10 ranks on CMC

[10-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but as long as people keep selling constantly, i imagine the patient buyers will just wait for them to stop selling before starting to buy. why buy today if tomorrow it will be cheaper

[10-Aug-19 09:13 AM] bluewh#7644
yes but KMD lost 20 rankings, I don't understand if all fall that rank is more on KMD

[10-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
in a hurricane, things get wet

[10-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
do you worry about why some things get more wet than others?

[10-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
is there anyway to know?

[10-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
until BTC dominance stops this surge (was 50% not so long ago, now 70%), alt prices will be nonsense

[10-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
30% of total marketcap is shared between all the other alts, including the stable coins

[10-Aug-19 09:16 AM] bluewh#7644
so I am alone to worry that KMD may not recover ?

[10-Aug-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if you believe that BTC dominance will keep increasing to 90% and stay there forever, then no alt will recover

[10-Aug-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
just sell all your alts now and buy back when they are 30% of current prices, if you believe BTC dominance will peak at 90%

[10-Aug-19 09:19 AM] bluewh#7644
i think it will stay but not kill project so early, the only thing i worry is that KMD dropped more and some projects of KMD are safe or say backdoor

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has always been  a bit more volatile that others during these swing periods, it falls more, but it also gains more

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] bluewh#7644
because RFOX invest in k64

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
no RFOX did not invest in K64

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] bluewh#7644
or opposed, I don t know

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
K64 claimed they invested in RFOX, but there is no proof of this

[10-Aug-19 09:20 AM] bluewh#7644
oh

[10-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
they claimed they got giant investment, but again no verifiable proof of this

[10-Aug-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
they admit they are operating on a shoestring budget, which is strange if they raised $78 mil in funding. but we wait for the proofs of investment before making any judgement

[10-Aug-19 09:22 AM] bluewh#7644
but the channel is archived now

[10-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
they have their own discord, they operate totally independently of komodo

[10-Aug-19 09:24 AM] bluewh#7644
all right, i didnt know

[10-Aug-19 09:24 AM] bluewh#7644
i hope KMD recover, because i am worry

[10-Aug-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD tech keeps improving, last week we made what is arguably the best DAA for PoW chains

[10-Aug-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV is continuing to get more and more CC support

[10-Aug-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is improving with each new release and getting more and more beta testers

[10-Aug-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the market does whatever it does in cycles, we cannot be slaves to that

[10-Aug-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, when KMD price is most depending on BTC price, it means that as with all the other altcoins, what each project is doing is not being reflected in price

do we know if big hold people move fund ? because if they move maybe they sell

[10-Aug-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are so worried, best to reduce your exposure. either you are ok to hold through these downturns, or you need to be trading in and out. if you trade in and out, just dont complain about how hard it is to predict the short term price movements

[10-Aug-19 09:30 AM] bluewh#7644
ðŸ˜¦

[10-Aug-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand what BTC dominance going from 50% to 70% means

[10-Aug-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
look at KMD price when the dominance is back down to 50%

[10-Aug-19 09:46 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
If I want to buy alts with fiat via btc.  I should just matter btc price right not ratio ?? So buy in after any significant btc drop ??

[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
So ideal at any btc bottom

[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
?

[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Basicially can I gain dollar while btc drops trough ratio gains

[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
this is new territory, we have never seen BTC dominance rise so much. the last time it was this high it was after it fell from the 80%+ that it was due to it being the first

[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i expect chaos

[10-Aug-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but waiting for BTC fiat price to drop, while dominance is not changing, that does seem a good way to get alts at better fiat prices

[10-Aug-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
however when there is such volatility, a DCA seems the best way

[10-Aug-19 10:16 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Thx mate

[10-Aug-19 11:12 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
