Fortunate?
Nothing fortunate to come back from being 0 - 2 behind and beating it with 3 - 2
Pure teamspirit, power and talents..

@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies well but japan is a good team.. belgium is also good but maybe not as good as brazil/uruguay/france..one thing good about japan is they are not a dirty team, and played fairly..even their fans stayed back to clean up the trash at the stadium after the match..

[03-Jul-18 08:20 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
We never won quarter finals.. it will be hard for sure.. but there is a little chance..

staking contest, 1000 KMD first prize for staking the most coins on a POSTEST64 chain!

komodod is able to launch independent chains with PoS/PoW generation of blocks. the ratio can be 0% to 100% PoS. The PoS uses a unique 64-way segmented staking where each utxo's address is in one of 64 different segment ids (segid) and each segid creates a staking battle within each segment. Each block the "0 segid" rotates and becomes eligible to stake first. Every 2 seconds, the next segid becomes eligible, so after 128 seconds all utxo are eligible, but the lower segids are having the advantage.

The goal of the contest is to find the best algos for allocating your stake across the different segids. A naive allocation of 1/64th to all the segments would be better than having all funds in one address, but the game theory requires to know where the stakes of the other people influence how you allocate your funds.

In order to participate, join the CHIPS discord as we will conduct the testing there since this is like a game. To generate 64 addresses, the latest marketmaker has a gen64addrs api:

source userpass
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"gen64addrs\",\"passphrase\":\"default\"}"

of course use a better passphrase than "default", it will return an array of address/wif and also just the addresses. post your 64 address array in the CHIPS discord to register for the contest. the gen64addrs api will also print out the required importprivkey cli calls to import all the addresses into a wallet.

there is a getbalance64 call in the komodod that will print your wallet's segid balances. we will start the contest this week, likely on Thursday, so there is a few days to get setup. use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker

[03-Jul-18 07:51 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
one of the most used narratives during last year Bitcoin civil war, was that LN allowed atomic swaps and so Segwit+LN was good. Completely ignoring existing on-chain atomic swaps

[03-Jul-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
my blood pressure pills are in wife's car, so I will not even start on segwit narratives

Atomic swaps over LN is just one thing it can do, it was never really one of the key narratives which was always scaling and somewhat privacy

[03-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Alright#0419
Barterdex will be able to bridge LN atomic swaps with CLTV atomic swaps via CHIPS

[03-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Jazzy#0001
I expect most/all BTC inclusive atomic swap protocols to do so in the next year or so

we have 12 participants for the staking test and 1000 KMD prize, so that is enough to start the test today at 2PM UTC. Test will run for a week to allow time for strategies to work (or not). Each block hash a 10 coin reward, so other than txfees the winner should simply be the one that staked the most blocks. Late entries can be accepted but the odds go against you so dont delay
