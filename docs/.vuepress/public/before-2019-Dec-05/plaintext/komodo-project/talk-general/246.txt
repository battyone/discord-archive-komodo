`ultimately someone has to pay for the 3000 BTC of txfees per year`
Maybe safcoin can teach them how to do it for free?

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
altcoins are going to pay 3000 BTC worth of their coins?

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] crunchycat#0726
So when I see stuff on Twitter about a dev here (allegedly) I like to ask about it

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] sœÜldat#8733
"they paid $5 million to advisors for this PR" they paid for trollors too

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it seems clear

[01-Apr-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like bitconnect

[01-Apr-19 06:31 PM] crunchycat#0726
smh... okay guys. Believe what you want to believe

[01-Apr-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe some people will think that is a good thing

[01-Apr-19 06:31 PM] sœÜldat#8733

There's the confirmation

[01-Apr-19 07:17 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Atomic swap 1:1 to the new chain it's quite simple. Moving to the kmd ecosystem they will inherit all the technology currently available within  the Komodo ecosystem

[01-Apr-19 07:18 PM] Llama#1330
wdym scam kids

[01-Apr-19 07:25 PM] BlackJesus#6161
You know what I want to see.. I want to see one of these migrating coins garner enough support in the kmd ecosystem to pull a notary node down into their dev circle.

so any answer about the closed source?

[01-Apr-19 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the economic model to support 3000 BTC per year?

[01-Apr-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
these veriblock guys are worse than unSAFE

[01-Apr-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
next thing they will blame us for the 3000 BTC in txfees

[01-Apr-19 07:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@two2too  POP mining requires 1000x the transactions and at least 4x BTC And doesn‚Äôt not have any sort of sustainable economic model

[01-Apr-19 07:55 PM] crunchycat#0726
I see it the same

[01-Apr-19 07:56 PM] crunchycat#0726
More notarizations equals more secure

[01-Apr-19 07:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Requires BTC to do notarizations ,  recompense for BTC requires comes from altcoins percentage of mining . Altcoins don‚Äôt have value miners won‚Äôt notarize

[01-Apr-19 07:57 PM] crunchycat#0726
Vbk miners will as long as as vbk has value

[01-Apr-19 07:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tell VBK to understand Gresham‚Äôs Law

[01-Apr-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how are more notarizations that are redundant and not even looked at helping security at all?

[01-Apr-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
some pretty bold claims are being made, and they seem to be mostly not true

no scam.. they will open source shortly

[01-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Bill P#0322
it works the same as pow.. you buy equipment to mine... pop you pay btc to mine.. if pow nethash is too high and not profitable you mine something else. if pop is to expensive you stop mining... bottom line is, either way people will still mine it. just less

[01-Apr-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
"vbk-insecurity" seems redundant

[01-Apr-19 08:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs funny all these new people shilling VBK

[01-Apr-19 08:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And you need an education on economics

[01-Apr-19 08:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I hope a lot of miners switch to pop

Pop miners make a lot of money

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I stated my argument , Gresham‚Äôs law dooms it to failure

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Bill P#0322
no pop miners pay the btc. not vbk

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As long as vbk price > relative btc cost

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Bill P#0322
pop miners are paid in vbk

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
At a cost of a percentage of their coin to cover out of pocket notarization costs.  Economically doesn‚Äôt work.   I mentioned Gresham‚Äôs law ,  ‚Äúbad money drives out the good‚Äù,   In a situation where legal tender laws ( VBK protocol for notary reimbursement ) require good and bad forms of commodity currency ( BTC = Good , Shitcoin reimbursement = bad )  to be accepted equally ( which they do in essence ).  People will spend their shitcoin and hoard their btc.  Their shitcoin markets are thinly liquid , to recoup the cost of upfronting the notarization in BTC, shitcoin has to be sold, which then devalues their currency eventually to the point that what is charged as a fee from the protected coin is not equal to the btc required for notarization.

[01-Apr-19 08:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then its fine

[01-Apr-19 08:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If vbk price collapses

[01-Apr-19 08:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362

nope.. they are threatened. instead of admitting the competition is legit... what is wrong with competition anyways?? competition make you work harder no?

[01-Apr-19 08:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That‚Äôs not how PoW works

[01-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Who is threatened?

[01-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont think kmd is threatened, if it works in the wild we will see soon enough

[01-Apr-19 08:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not threatened at all, we do it cheaper, more efficiently , and have 3rd party chains running it currently. VBK has nothing currently

[01-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe kmd can learn something

[01-Apr-19 08:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362

you would need to 51% attack btc too

[01-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Alright#0419
can't see the source so we don't know that

[01-Apr-19 08:25 PM] Bill P#0322
must have lots of money to do that

[01-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
When attacking pop, you increase the price for everyone to pop mine, so normal pop miners are less likely to mine?

[01-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Bill P#0322
you really think you can 51% attack vbk and btc? do you know how much hashrate that would take to do? when the alt coin implements vbk.. now you have to go through 3, The alt, vbk and btc

[01-Apr-19 08:27 PM] Alright#0419
I'll bet you any amount of money that I can find exploits in it.

[01-Apr-19 08:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If the attacker is 51% mining VBK and the protected chain,  the only choose to accept notarizations that fit his version of events , then the protection is moot

[01-Apr-19 08:28 PM] Bill P#0322
you guys really need to read up on how pop works... you are not understanding the technology
