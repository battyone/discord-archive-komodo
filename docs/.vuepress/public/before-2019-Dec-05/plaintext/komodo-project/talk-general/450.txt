just isn't a DEX at all as far as i can tell. the only similarity is the lack of KYC

@AtomicWallet @KomodoPlatform Read thru your site and ChangeNOW

I'm a little confused

What exactly makes you an "Atomic Swap DEX"?

Thanks

atomic or not, they listed kmd. perhaps due to demand.

[15-Nov-19 12:10 AM] gigamesh#3544
they call themselves an Atomic Swap DEX

[15-Nov-19 12:11 AM] gigamesh#3544
when really it's a wallet (that you control the keys to, like any ordinary wallet),  which interacts with centralized exchanges

[15-Nov-19 12:15 AM] phm87#7395
maybe they have 64 nodes with multisig ? it decentralize it a little bit ... :troll:

[15-Nov-19 12:16 AM] gigamesh#3544
so i doubt it

[15-Nov-19 12:17 AM] phm87#7395
if they use some CEX to have good prices and liquidity and atomic swap, it can become good if they prepared well their stuff

[15-Nov-19 12:17 AM] gigamesh#3544
they only buy from CEX

[15-Nov-19 12:18 AM] phm87#7395
but I agree with gigamesh, mostly CEX now it seems

[15-Nov-19 12:18 AM] gigamesh#3544
there are no oredrbooks, there is no P2P, and you dont control your funds during the trade

all's fair in crypto. I think I pissed off decred awhile back. havent been back since.

[15-Nov-19 12:39 AM] gigamesh#3544
what id like to know is which pairs are (in their opinion) atomic swapable? ``Use decentralized Atomic Swap to proceed with cross-chain exchange avoiding third party risks.

For coins not yet supported by Atomic Swap, we have built-in ShapeShift, ChangeNOW and Changelly exchanges.``

these guys are pretty big players, buddies with Binance etc. should misnomers pass unchecked?

no advertising, but i've had a very good experience with minipc.eu and their support. they're from .nl and do ship around europe, and they do accept KMD. easily good enough to give a recommendation. especially their support is ridiculously awesome, i'm not joking.

quicker and more useful than in-country stores like media markt. they managed to send replacement ram over a country border over night (to have it at the customer before the weekend comes)... i am... baffled.
