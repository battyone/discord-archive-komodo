but we are now at the point where new coins (not security) can create a differentiated value add via the CC

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and all the rest of the infrastructure, including a blockchain!, is already done

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a full blockchain codebase is hundreds of thousands of lines of code

[30-Sep-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a custom CC is typically 1000 lines or so

[30-Sep-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a 99% reduction of codebase and sometimes there isnt any coding needed to create a unique value

[30-Sep-18 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, for all of the "only marketing matters" people, please look at XVG

[30-Sep-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there are now many new projects that appear to be corporate backed or actual corporations, these have the advantage of focus and capital, but being corporate in nature has the problems of being proprietary. even if they are open source, it is not likely they have an open community

[30-Sep-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
in the last year, we have seen how the open community in KMD has blossomed and now we have new devs doing things across the entire ecosystem

[30-Sep-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
I cant even keep up with all the different things at this point

[30-Sep-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so I concentrate on the core and keep tinkering with the new breakthroughs

[30-Sep-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and I trust the community to fully productize and market and sell the finished products

`I cant even keep up with all the different things at this point`
It's quite sad how few will grasp just how much that sentence means (or on how many different levels it has meaning) in a truly short amount of time, because so many folks are so focused on "this minute" and 1-2 years being "forever".

[30-Sep-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and I only talk about tech/code things, i lost track of the non-code things happening long before

[30-Sep-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
since I am able to track a lot of tech things at once, the fact that I cant keep up anymore is definitely some sort of tipping point

[30-Sep-18 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
exactly

[30-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you are feeling that you cant keep up with all the tech happening, then it is not a bad thing, it just means a lot of stuff is happening

[30-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and probably nobody has the full complete picture

[30-Sep-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so to expect marketing/GUI to be tracking this in realtime, well, that would be the true "FTL" invention that i have no idea how to even approach solving

[30-Sep-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm obviously biased, but imo if anyone can look at Komodo (as a whole or in part) and not see the insanely great growth and imagine even greater potential that can/will unfold, then they shouldn't even be in the crypto space

[30-Sep-18 10:45 AM] snowdamn#2414
those that have the know-how to understand (much less build on) the code base are a minority
these are very early days for crypto

[30-Sep-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but they sure like to tell me how I am wrong about things

[30-Sep-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`these are very early days for crypto` <- far too many people still don't get that

[30-Sep-18 10:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
so, when you look at what has already been done you can immediately understand that Komodo Platform has gathered a lot of brain power

[30-Sep-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
the people that dont understand the tech are the first to proclaim how bad it is

[30-Sep-18 10:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
i would say Komodo Platform is ahead of the curve
but you need to think outside of CMC to see it 😉

[30-Sep-18 10:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`think outside of CMC `
People do that? 😮

[30-Sep-18 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
A site to track active git repos for anything KMD related would be pretty cool

[30-Sep-18 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That's only half a joke; I, literally, had someone try to convince me yesterday that PIRATE has no value because it's not on any exchange 🤦🏿

[30-Sep-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
just throwing that out there... 😂 not able to do that myself

[30-Sep-18 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
pretty sure I could find about 100 repos

[30-Sep-18 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm sure it would find 100 just in nomp forks :p

[30-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
when ac_perc nomp

[30-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Alright#0419
give up on that? :/

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c is there a technical reason why ac_perc coinbase txs must be pubkey as opposed to pubkeyhash?

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
it is true that i'm now falling behind with all these techs happening here

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] snowdamn#2414
wasn't there an article about that with Komodo very high on the list
and it probably wasn't even on all repos

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
it was *1* repo

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when ac_perc nomp`
When you find someone smarter than me that can understand the buffers it uses or when I have an epiphany; whichever comes 1st

[30-Sep-18 10:53 AM] snowdamn#2414
wow

[30-Sep-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
very fast development happened in the last couple of months. incredibly fast!

what is FTL tech ?

[30-Sep-18 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
faster than light

[30-Sep-18 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c can ac_perc be reworked to allow both pubkey and pubkeyhash vouts in coinbase? Seems any current stratum will require a lot of work to make compatible

[30-Sep-18 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
just wondering if that's maybe the easier route

[30-Sep-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not sure that "a lot of work" is as much correct as it needs someone that understands that part of the library
converting the needed bits back and forth between the buffers and human readable text and coming out with the right final bits is just beyond my reach

[30-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I`m currently syncing the KMD wallet ... It takes hours ... dont know what speed of light u are talking about

[30-Sep-18 10:59 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
It has been on for 4 hours and it is at 5.75%

[30-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and I only have 1 connection ...

[30-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
5.79% | 59708 / 1032097 | Connections: 1

[30-Sep-18 11:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
FTL analogy wasn't referring to blockchain sync time 😄

[30-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
well U better do something about that time cuz dont know who will even want to use wallet that takes days to sync

[30-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
Why does it only have 1 connection?

[30-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Alright#0419
Are you using agama or cli?

[30-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
no idea ... some kind of a box appeared that claimed it will speed things up - I clicked on it and the wallet made restart and now it is 1 connection

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
so agama?

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
what OS?

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] BlockTech#6895
yes i think so

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] BlockTech#6895
probably windows

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Agama on Win 7 x64

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
can you look at the komodo.conf file and see if maxconnections is set to 1?

[30-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Alright#0419
%appdata%\komodo\komodo.conf

[30-Sep-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`some kind of a box appeared that claimed it will speed things up - I clicked on it and the wallet made restart and now it is 1 connection`
That's why you should read and understand "box thingys" iirc, it said it would only do 1 connection if applied

[30-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
well U dont  get it

[30-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U need to make the wallet work perfect so I dont have to read anything

[30-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
and it just works

{Reactions}
🤦🏿 

[30-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
just ignore him, do you want help fixing it?

[30-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I dont have the wallet installed in the default location - trying to find the file u mentioned

[30-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
I believe it will be there no matter where you installed agama

[30-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Alright#0419
type `%appdata%` into windows explorer

[30-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
into the directory path or whatever you want to call it

[30-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
I`m searching for komodo.conf in C

[30-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
found it

[30-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
yes max connection is 1

[30-Sep-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so I dont have to read anything`
Sorry, the mind-reading feature will not be available until Windows 19

[30-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
😄 the box the I clicked claimed it will speed the wallet

[30-Sep-18 11:12 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
so ... u do the conclusions

[30-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
stop the wallet and remove that line

[30-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
then restart the wallet

[30-Sep-18 11:13 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
already did it

[30-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
@pbca26 why does agama have that popup? Will maxconnections=1 actually speed up sync times in some cases?

[30-Sep-18 11:14 AM] pbca26#5430
don't ask me, ask whoever proposed this idea

[30-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
Who?

[30-Sep-18 11:16 AM] pbca26#5430
i can't recall now
someone was looking into this on slack/tradebots channel
about a year ago i think

[30-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Alright#0419
maybe I'm missing something, but that seems to me like it would guarantee slower sync times

[30-Sep-18 11:18 AM] pbca26#5430
it was something related to constantly redownloading headers
which led to abnormal network utilization

[30-Sep-18 11:19 AM] pbca26#5430
if you're 100% positive it's no good anymore
i will remove it

[30-Sep-18 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or bold the verb (may or might or whatever it is) to stop people that don't read it anyway from believing it says "will"?

[30-Sep-18 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not positive. I'd need to fully understand why it was added to begin with

[30-Sep-18 11:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have experience of just 1 connection to a node, if it's on vpn

[30-Sep-18 11:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
connected to  network which is slow

[30-Sep-18 11:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
changing the vpn to other network/region can help if one is using

[30-Sep-18 11:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or just try once without vpn may be

[30-Sep-18 11:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that isn't the issue, then your region must be having less nodes around.... just guessing....

[30-Sep-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As a miner, I never tried just one node; however, when I saw it, my assumption was that it would keep you on a seednode only and not let you get bogged down by 8 connections to slow/bad nodes

[30-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
Slow sync speed on Windows? Try this workaround.
It will add maxconnections=1 in komodo.conf file and force close the app.
Please run the app again after that.
This is what the box says and the botton says " apply work around"

[30-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
u should most def remove it

[30-Sep-18 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It assumes that "Slow sync speed" means that you read the 1st screen and understood that it can take up to a day to sync to begin with

[30-Sep-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that you were basing your observation of "slow" on that

[30-Sep-18 11:49 AM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
U are pretty dumb or just annoying ?  5 hours into syncing I am at 7.2 % with 2 connections . On a very fast internet connection + 12 (24t) Xeon with 64 GB ram and SSD  . That is super slow  by any measurement and comparison - go sync some top 100 alts and see how most of them do it in under 2 hours
