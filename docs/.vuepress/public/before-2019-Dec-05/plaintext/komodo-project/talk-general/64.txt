I think a well plotted out timeline of returns for projects that jl777 was associated with would serve to elucidate the masses on what is being created here. I'm fine with us being in shadows  though. I'll just keep buying while it's cheap.

[13-Sep-18 10:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
And  I suspect that the coins that supernet holds are payments for the expertise contributed by our anonymous leader and wizard lvl blockchain engineer. If you are new to crypto, and you are here.. you have found a diamond in the rough

The thing I  that I find most compelling is that it is the intellectual returns on the work itself that are the driving influence. It is the work in and of itself that feeds this machine. Needless to say. I am backing this project for the rest of my life.

To be frank, after the hundreds of white papers, interviews, conversations with developers since 2013, I will admit that James and Komodo team are far ahead in terms of realising the vision that we as libertarians (small L) are addressing

I was able to make a gatewaysCC (improved MGW) in 3 days, still finalizing some issues, but to get an automated crypto tokenizer in days, instead of many months (or years), it is due to the CC architecture

It's really mind-blowing that so cool and relatively secure things creating so fast  🙀

[13-Sep-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
