I'm also concerned because if my email has possibly leaked from their database, they also took a scanned copy of my id - and would next want  my card details. That's a very concerning combination if they are indeed leaking user data

[22-Dec-18 11:13 PM] yorklab#7270
I don't recall getting any spam from coinbase before. Maybe it's something you have to opt out of. You could always ask Coinbase.

[22-Dec-18 11:13 PM] MaJoRa#0131
The spam isn't from coinbase themselves, that's the concern

[22-Dec-18 11:14 PM] MaJoRa#0131
It's loads of russian bride or penis enlargement type spam

[22-Dec-18 11:14 PM] MaJoRa#0131
It's also getting through to my inbox - which is the first time since opening my account nearly 7 years ago that's happened so far

[22-Dec-18 11:15 PM] MaJoRa#0131
I can't directly link said spam to coinbase, but this particular email address I use only for my financials (banking etc) - and very rarely share.

[22-Dec-18 11:15 PM] MaJoRa#0131
So it's concerning that I started receiving such spam so shortly after signing up.

[22-Dec-18 11:16 PM] yorklab#7270
It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with Coinbase. Might just be a coincidence.

[22-Dec-18 11:17 PM] MaJoRa#0131
I don't believe this would be coming from coinbase directly - and you're right in that it might just be a coincidence - but it's left me not feeling so trusting - hence my asking around

[22-Dec-18 11:18 PM] MaJoRa#0131
this particular email is used exclusively for my 4 bank accounts, and credit reports right now, and not shared on the internet at all. So I do find it deeply concerning I'm getting my first spam so shortly after signing up

[22-Dec-18 11:19 PM] yorklab#7270
I would think others would be asking also if there was a Coinbase issue....Coinbase has lots of users.

[22-Dec-18 11:20 PM] MaJoRa#0131
that's true, though I have to wonder if long term users recieved spam not from coinbase if they would make any kind of association to coinbase. I suspect if they had an issue, only new users might notice

[22-Dec-18 11:21 PM] yorklab#7270
Possible, but my guess is that you're OK.

[22-Dec-18 11:22 PM] yorklab#7270
The only thing I can say for sure is that I haven't seen anything unusual.

[22-Dec-18 11:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
I would raise the issue with coinbase directly. They‚Äôll get back to you in a week or so. Using multiple email addresses wouldn‚Äôt hurt though.

[23-Dec-18 12:17 AM] MaJoRa#0131
cheers guys - I probably will raise it with them directly,

[23-Dec-18 01:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Haven't gotten any spam from coinbase before .  Did you sign up directly on coinbases site ? Wondering if some phishing happened

[23-Dec-18 04:41 AM] Vertigo#0439
Careful sounds like phishing.

[23-Dec-18 10:16 AM] MaJoRa#0131
It was the app, not their website. So I'm certain I signed up the correct place.

[23-Dec-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`It was the app, not their website.`
app?

[23-Dec-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there's a Coinbase app now?

[23-Dec-18 11:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think android is your problem there.

[23-Dec-18 11:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
Could be any random app on your phone tracking your email activity.

[23-Dec-18 12:03 PM] MaJoRa#0131
possibly, but the phone is very new, and I'm extremely anal about what's installed. I don't use my phone for lesiure. It's got skype, and my banking apps on it.

[23-Dec-18 12:03 PM] MaJoRa#0131
the only other installed app is microsoft launcher

[23-Dec-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`possibly, but the phone is very new,`
That is irrelevant; not too long ago, I built a new computer and the 3rd app I installed had a worm and swiped every bit of KMD I had in wallet.dat
Not saying that's what happened, just pointing out that age and amount of apps doesn't mean "safe" (either all of your apps are safe or none of them are)

[23-Dec-18 12:20 PM] MaJoRa#0131
ah that's true, but I meant in terms of I haven't really had time to install anything too untrustworthy just yet

I'm not sure if it's worth putting out some PR about the fact Komodo is continuing to use equihash and not changing algorithm. I've heard it time and time again that people think Komodo is changing algo.

Hey all! If anyone is interested, I created a ledger (that I personally use) to help keep track of all my coins, profits, ROI, mining income, trades, etc and have been tweaking, updating and improving over the last 6-7 months. It also autoupdates the pricing of the top 2000 coins on Coinmarketcap. I figured I'd share it since i've had several people give it very positive feedback. If you end up using it, let me know what you think! (FYI, its for microsoft excel, google sheets is a PITA when doing API calls). https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5089175.0

Thanks to the Komodo community support, Indenodes & Metaphilibert, we have been able to successfully complete the stage #1 of our crowdfunding campaign: Komodo asset backed stable coin, KSB is now up and running (Komodo asset chain and token). 
Today, we are officially launching the stage #2 and with it its crowdfunding, migration of √ò Crypto Union Token OUR (ex GXE) from Ethereum to Komodo.
We will publish characteristics and the history of our company token from GXE to OUR later during the day.

Thank you all for your early support.

Very excited to see whats ahead for this project! Love how the success of this project will have positive impact on the komodo ecosystem, kmd holders as well as providing a stable coin for us as well. Very ambitious project where komodo has a lot to gain from too!

You can claim more often if you wish, but after one month the Rewards will stop if you don't claim it.
