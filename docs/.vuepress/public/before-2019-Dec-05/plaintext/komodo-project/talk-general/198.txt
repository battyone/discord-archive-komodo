i love brainfood - here s a small hint: not all elements on the picture are relevant.

üò¶ 

[03-Feb-19 11:10 PM] ca333#0118
also: some hints create more new questions than they solve old answers - for sake of crypto

[03-Feb-19 11:13 PM] Gawain#7858
yeah i tried similar stuff

[03-Feb-19 11:13 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'm thinking it will be a numeric seed this time

[03-Feb-19 11:14 PM] ca333#0118
but its good @cryptocat - if you had a team wit 2 other people here you would solve it...

for example if the high is higher or low is lower I make it a 1, otherwise 0 (w and w/o first number)

also tried comparing line lengths, if line is longer than its a 1 otherwise 0

morse code didn't seem to fit

[03-Feb-19 11:18 PM] cryptocat#9465
Binary

[03-Feb-19 11:26 PM] Gawain#7858
i tried various binary conversions too, to dec, hex, and ascii (although number of chars doesn't fit there, needs to be divisible by 8)

[03-Feb-19 11:28 PM] Gawain#7858
i liked your idea, and tried some stuff with it but didn't seem to work https://i.imgur.com/5hv5TJm.png

ah you got it, congrats

[03-Feb-19 11:31 PM] cryptocat#9465
I'll post the seed shortly, along with the solution

[03-Feb-19 11:31 PM] cryptocat#9465
But @Gawain you were very very close

[03-Feb-19 11:32 PM] ca333#0118
binary was the needed hint.

[03-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Gawain#7858
so above or below the horizontal? what about that point that's really close to horizontal?

[03-Feb-19 11:33 PM] cryptocat#9465
It's a 1

[03-Feb-19 11:33 PM] Gawain#7858
o i c

[03-Feb-19 11:34 PM] cryptocat#9465
Anything above the baseline is a 1, anything below is a 0.

[03-Feb-19 11:34 PM] Gawain#7858
haha, i know sometimes the line width makes things go further than intended

[03-Feb-19 11:34 PM] Gawain#7858
bad guess on my part

[03-Feb-19 11:34 PM] Gawain#7858
the center of the line vertex seemed very close to exact horizontal, threw me off

[03-Feb-19 11:34 PM] ca333#0118
congratulation @cryptocat

[03-Feb-19 11:35 PM] cryptocat#9465
@Gawain Send me your KMD address and I'll fire a few across to you. You helped me find the right path.

nah it's ok, you derserve it

[03-Feb-19 11:35 PM] Gawain#7858
thanks ca333 üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gawain#7858
and congrats again cryptocal üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:36 PM] cryptocat#9465
Thanks @ca333 this is the first time I've taken on these sort of challenges, pleasantly surprised

[03-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gawain#7858
haha they are a bit addictive

[03-Feb-19 11:36 PM] Gawain#7858
charlie lee did one for his spells of genesis cards before, I had a blast playing those too

[03-Feb-19 11:37 PM] cryptocat#9465
Sounds cool, I'll check them out

[03-Feb-19 11:37 PM] Gawain#7858
oh that was a whlie back, they are over, this was a nice new set of puzzles üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:37 PM] ca333#0118
i might raise the bar next week if you guys want

[03-Feb-19 11:38 PM] Gawain#7858
got me to play around with the agama wallet which is good üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:38 PM] ca333#0118
nice - i ll try and see what i can do

[03-Feb-19 11:38 PM] ca333#0118
like using other assetchains to find a TX-ID in the corresponding seed which then is the actual seed for the KMD key! :troll_hmm:

[03-Feb-19 11:39 PM] cryptocat#9465
Yea the Agama wallet is super easy to set up. Very useful for these sort of games where you need to quickly log out and back in with different seeds.

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
you know what the best thing is though

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
only those who cracked one before know it

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
the moment you crack it - you re almost getting a heartattack

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
no joke - its crazy. abnormal

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] kolo#1111
Im disappointed no one from the old team doesn't want to simply push memory and answer "Who is jl777?".
Seed not grabbed so far.
Here is hint: it's a picture.

No math, dots,  interpolation or annihilation needed.

[03-Feb-19 11:40 PM] ca333#0118
really hardcore experience.

you heartbeat goes up crazy - till you transfer them out. this is cuz you think someone else gonna crack it.

[03-Feb-19 11:41 PM] Gawain#7858
haha yeah it is a unique experience

[03-Feb-19 11:41 PM] ca333#0118
ohhh!!!! @kolo - sorry m8. ok i will try.

@kolo made one. its about our sensei

@ca333 only those who ~2.5 years and more here can know

[03-Feb-19 11:42 PM] kolo#1111
Hint 2: if you don't remember - ask mr. President.

[03-Feb-19 11:43 PM] ca333#0118
no more hints! üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:46 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Haaa last hint made me sure of it

[03-Feb-19 11:46 PM] kolo#1111
@metaphilibert I waited for you here. Was 100% sure you remember

[03-Feb-19 11:47 PM] metaphilibert#0926
My first guess was "a simple C coder"

[03-Feb-19 11:47 PM] metaphilibert#0926
But now I know

[03-Feb-19 11:48 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I will say it clearly here because I don't have the possibility to test it in agama right now

[03-Feb-19 11:48 PM] kolo#1111
No

[03-Feb-19 11:48 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Ah ok

[03-Feb-19 11:48 PM] kolo#1111
Let's check if someone else remembers

[03-Feb-19 11:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i tried C programmer, Simple C Programmer

[03-Feb-19 11:49 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Ok ok

[03-Feb-19 11:49 PM] kolo#1111
@metaphilibert do you have that pic?

[03-Feb-19 11:49 PM] metaphilibert#0926
It's fun

[03-Feb-19 11:49 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Will dm üòâ

[03-Feb-19 11:50 PM] ca333#0118
i know it

[03-Feb-19 11:50 PM] SHossain#0007
only few people knows?

[03-Feb-19 11:51 PM] SHossain#0007
:troll:

[03-Feb-19 11:51 PM] Decker#3767
```$array = [ 0, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 0, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1,1,1, -1, 1, 0];
var_dump(count($array));
$s = "";
for ($i=0; $i<count($array); $i++) {
         switch ($array[$i]) {
            case  0: $s.=" "; break;
            case  1: $s.="1"; break;
            case -1: $s.="0"; break;
         }
}```
That was my code ... I guessed that the peaks higher than center line - is 1, lower - 0, and on center line - nothing (space) ...

`string(11) "5c2a5d5555d"`

[03-Feb-19 11:52 PM] Decker#3767
but i didn't finish it )

[03-Feb-19 11:52 PM] Decker#3767
so, what was the seed ?

[03-Feb-19 11:52 PM] ca333#0118
yes i saw you went idle mode

[03-Feb-19 11:52 PM] ca333#0118
unfortunately exactly by then they posted hints

[03-Feb-19 11:52 PM] ca333#0118

above = 1

[03-Feb-19 11:53 PM] Gawain#7858
apparently there were no center line peaks üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 11:57 PM] Decker#3767

if you really want to mess with people, make the image require a 2d fourier transform to figure it out lmao

[04-Feb-19 12:04 AM] cryptocat#9465
Or a wavelength to audio decoder...which speaks out the seed...

[04-Feb-19 12:04 AM] Gawain#7858
haha nice

[04-Feb-19 12:04 AM] Gawain#7858
.txt file you have to play in vlc üòÑ

[04-Feb-19 12:05 AM] Decker#3767
