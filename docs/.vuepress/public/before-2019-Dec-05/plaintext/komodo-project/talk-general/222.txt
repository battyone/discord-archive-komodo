hey guys what is the cost of creating a blockchain via komodo?

[03-Mar-19 05:24 PM] nocturnal#2177
and what level of technical skill is required?

[03-Mar-19 05:26 PM] bubu#1031
hello all

[03-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no fee to create a blockchain

[03-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you would need to be able to issue command line calls like:
./komodod -ac_name=NOCTURNAL -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=100000000

[03-Mar-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
that allows to create chains without dPoW. to add dPoW there is an annual cost, but that is only needed after mainnet launch

[03-Mar-19 05:40 PM] nocturnal#2177
so what is the quality control?

[03-Mar-19 05:40 PM] nocturnal#2177
would it not end up like waves assets (90% scam)

[03-Mar-19 05:41 PM] nocturnal#2177
if thre is no barrier to entry i mean

[03-Mar-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you created your chain. who will use it or even know about it?

[03-Mar-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like there is anyway for anybody to know that you made a new chain

[03-Mar-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so it wont allow spammers to create a new chain and force everybody to see it

[03-Mar-19 05:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
well what people do with waves is create a ton of tokens for nothing, stick up a website and list them on exchanges

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
then dump and run

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
happens constantly

[03-Mar-19 05:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
seems like exact same thing can be done with komodo assets if there is no barrier to entry

[03-Mar-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
who would buy a coin without any security? without dPoW a new chain will not be secure

[03-Mar-19 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a lot more effort to maintain a blockchain than a token, which requires no additional effort.

[03-Mar-19 05:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
noobs buy them buy the billions lol

[03-Mar-19 05:54 PM] nille#9011
hello everyone

[03-Mar-19 05:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
but at least there is some technica knowledge required, that is a small barrier to entry

[03-Mar-19 05:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
(maintaning)

[03-Mar-19 06:21 PM] Edward#3177
Hey all, this has probably been asked already, but will there be any incentives to hold or use KMD on BarterDEX or the mobile version beyond the 5.1% yearly rewards?

[03-Mar-19 06:21 PM] Edward#3177
Just thinking it would be nice to get more use of KMD in the ecosystem without being too much of a barrier to entry.

[03-Mar-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
what incentive is there to hold BTC, LTC, or any other currency?

[03-Mar-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea of locking people in to pay high fees, that is very blockstream thinking

[03-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
what it does is makes people look for alternatives, the more such fees, the more urgent the need to switch

[03-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is the center of the ecosystem

[03-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the bigger the ecosystem, the more value KMD has

[03-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it does not have to be transactional

[03-Mar-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is the natural trading pair for ecosystem coins

[03-Mar-19 06:27 PM] Edward#3177
Good points. Not demanding it be transactional though. Like just offering an incentive like what BNB does. That's at least an option.

[03-Mar-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
by incentive, you mean paid incentive. where do these funds come from?

[03-Mar-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BNB has its value from the paid incentive. what happens to it the moment those incentives are gone?

[03-Mar-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
is there any ecosystem around BNB coin?

[03-Mar-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is getting more and more projects that are joining as it allows to jumpstart things and for much less effort to get a fully functioning and independent blockchain.

[03-Mar-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so because there is no payment required other than the nominal dPoW fees for notarization, there is really no reason not to build on komodo. which means a lot more projects will decide to do this

[03-Mar-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and if KMD gets just a small percentage of the overall ecosystems value, then this becomes a bigger and bigger value over time. like BTC is the center of a very large ecosystem and that gives it a lot of value, even though it doesnt even pay 5% APR.

[03-Mar-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so when KMD has a very large ecosystem and is paying 5%, then really, what more is needed

[03-Mar-19 06:33 PM] Edward#3177
All true. Patience is key here of course. Just brainstorming a bit outloud. Some incentives would help get KMD into a higher cmc ranking. Of course it would be good for speculators, but that ranking helps to show legitimacy for projects shopping for where to build.

[03-Mar-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
we welcome all donations to help pay for such incentives

[03-Mar-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
it is easy to spend other peoples money

[03-Mar-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but the reality is that the crypto industry is very expensive to even just get published press releases

[03-Mar-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
everything costs 10x to 1000x more than it should

[03-Mar-19 06:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
and takes 1000x longer ðŸ˜‚

[03-Mar-19 06:36 PM] Edward#3177
Could there be some kind of friendly way to fund such a thing from the 5.1% yearly reward of top wallets. Like a scaling system or dare I say it, tax brackets. Shit I hate that I even think of such a thing, but it's worth working through a convo about.

[03-Mar-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so go and convince the top wallets to pay a tax

[03-Mar-19 06:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
or charge fees for blockchain creation

[03-Mar-19 06:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
would raise money and keep out scammers

[03-Mar-19 06:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
some scammers

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the way the tech works, charging a KMD fee to create an independent chain would be totally artificial

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is open source, they can just fork it

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
people seem to forget this

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
ah ok

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is a zero cost option by forking, then having any cost is a barrier

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
its all greek to me

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes indeed

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
no point

[03-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and putting up barriers to adoption during the "get as much adoption as you can phase" is backwards

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
sure. waves tokens have become a bad joke tho

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Edward#3177
For sure, they can fork code, but they can't fork the leadership. Just working through some thoughts. Thanks for addressing it.

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
just saying

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
good to avoid that somehow

[03-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
gatekeeping and independence do not work together

[03-Mar-19 06:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
so what is the benefit for a company to build on komodo rather than make there own chain?

[03-Mar-19 06:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
less technical knowledge is required?

[03-Mar-19 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
creating a BTC fork can take months

[03-Mar-19 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
creating an assetchain takes minutes

[03-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
maintaining a BTC fork can take a team of people

[03-Mar-19 06:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
time and expertise

[03-Mar-19 06:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
this is what makes a project legit

[03-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
maintaining a assetchain can take 0 people

[03-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
0 people other than our notaries, devs and community

[03-Mar-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
but basically there can be very little maintenance needed on chain creator's part

[03-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
Assetchains are very modular, just pick and choose which features you like

[03-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
features that would otherwise take you months(if not years) to code in your own BTC fork

[03-Mar-19 06:46 PM] nocturnal#2177
sure ok

[03-Mar-19 06:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
so there is flexibility about what the blockchain can be used for

[03-Mar-19 06:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
other than just a monetary token

[03-Mar-19 06:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
(like waves tokens)

its the difference between having a picture of a car vs having the actual car

[03-Mar-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
does kmd have any stable coin in the ecosystem yet?

[03-Mar-19 07:25 PM] coingirl87#6489
Hi, where i can find the exported transaction history in agama? I only get a popup "CSV export is saved at"

[03-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Markus#5464
Most likely where the agama is saved

[03-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Markus#5464
in the wallet folder

[03-Mar-19 07:28 PM] coingirl87#6489
Yes i had the same idea but there is no data :-(

[03-Mar-19 07:29 PM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe a bug?

@Markus There is KSB. I'm not sure the current status. It either just launched or is about to launch. You could ask in #Ã¸pay
