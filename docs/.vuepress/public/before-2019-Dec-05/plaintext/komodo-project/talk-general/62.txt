@ryman112 may be you'll just need a hardware wallet, like Ledger, instead of new PC ?

[08-Sep-18 02:26 AM] jspook16#3059
how much are you looking to spend

[08-Sep-18 02:27 AM] ryman112#0068
I have a nano s.

[08-Sep-18 02:27 AM] jspook16#3059
i think he wants a PC to also test/play with the different chains

[08-Sep-18 02:27 AM] ryman112#0068
I know nothing about security and want this to be as solid as can be

[08-Sep-18 02:28 AM] ryman112#0068
@jspook16 js I want to get into that but I am paranoid about security.

[08-Sep-18 02:28 AM] jspook16#3059
encrypt the install and then use veracrypt to encrpt your wallet back ups.......bury your usb with backups in air tight vacuum

[08-Sep-18 02:28 AM] ryman112#0068
See that is gibberish to me lmao

[08-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Decker#3767
Using Linux instead of Windows is a first approach to security.

[08-Sep-18 02:31 AM] jspook16#3059
ok....its all a matter of growing into it......baby steps. first set up your separate machine. install the OS

[08-Sep-18 02:31 AM] jspook16#3059
those are two big steps

[08-Sep-18 02:31 AM] ryman112#0068
I have zero knowledge about linux.  I will do some research

[08-Sep-18 02:32 AM] ryman112#0068
Im not dumb just never been In this situation before where I cared so much about security.

[08-Sep-18 02:33 AM] ryman112#0068
You guys are leagues above me.  Now if you want a house built Im your guy lol

[08-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Decker#3767
Nothing hard in typical Linux, like Ubuntu. It also have GUI and Desktop. Remember the day when you saw Windows PC first time in a life. I think it was easy to start do basic things on it. With Linux - all is same. Just need to start and learn.

[08-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Decker#3767
Windows PC also can be secured ... but, Linux, i think, preferrable.

[08-Sep-18 02:35 AM] ryman112#0068
@Decker  thanks

[08-Sep-18 02:35 AM] jspook16#3059
I concur.

[08-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I am first time linux user and use ubuntu and it's pretty intuitive

[08-Sep-18 02:36 AM] jspook16#3059
There might be some machines out there you can purchase with ubuntu already on them....that would save you a couple steps

Thanks so very much

[08-Sep-18 02:38 AM] ryman112#0068
@jspook16  I haven't looked yet obviously but what are the average prices of the machines you listed.  Ballpark

[08-Sep-18 02:40 AM] Nabob#5004
start with  free tier AWS, get your hands dirty or install linux using virtualbox  on your pc,

[08-Sep-18 02:41 AM] Decker#3767
Depends on country. I think best way is to visit any computer parts online shop well-known in your country and pick up needed computer parts according to your budget. After - install Linux on it. It's free and nothing hard (installer will guide you). Or just play with VirtualBox on your existing Windows PC, as Nabob adviced.

[08-Sep-18 02:41 AM] jspook16#3059
z170 (outdated it seems) $80 usd, cpu 120,  8gb ram 55, SSD (500gb sata) 100

[08-Sep-18 02:42 AM] ryman112#0068
U.s.

[08-Sep-18 02:42 AM] jspook16#3059
power supply  $40

[08-Sep-18 02:43 AM] ryman112#0068
So newegg?

[08-Sep-18 02:43 AM] jspook16#3059
@Nabob 's idea is good too. try linux first on a server or in a virtual machine

[08-Sep-18 02:43 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah or amazon

[08-Sep-18 02:44 AM] jspook16#3059
amazon is less hassle in my opinion. just make sure the parts are compatible with each other. cpu socket matches mother board and RAM is compatible with motherboard ddr3 vs ddr4 etc

[08-Sep-18 02:45 AM] ryman112#0068
So I can do this for a 1000 or under

[08-Sep-18 02:46 AM] jspook16#3059
im thinking under 500....you dont event need a case at first (just dust it out often)

[08-Sep-18 02:48 AM] ryman112#0068
I could use one of my TVs as a monitor Im assuming

[08-Sep-18 02:48 AM] jspook16#3059
yes or get a cheap one. keyboard and mouse too

[08-Sep-18 02:49 AM] Decker#3767
I never bought anything on Amazon, but i see many offers like "HP Pavilion Desktop Computer, Intel Core i7-7700, 12GB RAM, 1TB hard drive, Windows 10" for 600-700 USD on it. Without Windows it should be even cheaper.

[08-Sep-18 02:50 AM] Decker#3767
So, i agree with @jspook16 - 500-600 USD budget will be sufficient.

[08-Sep-18 02:51 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah i guess you can run a chance that the harware is compromised on amazon (im assuming thats why @Decker advises against amazon)

[08-Sep-18 02:56 AM] jspook16#3059
hot doggity!...i just created my first asset chain

[08-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Decker#3767
@jspook16 sorry ... seems small misunderstanding here ) I'm not advising anything against Amazon. Just said that i never bought anything from it.

[08-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Decker#3767
Gongratz with your own asset! )

[08-Sep-18 02:57 AM] jspook16#3059
oh i just re-read that....yep i misunderstood

[08-Sep-18 02:57 AM] ryman112#0068
Ok so that makes me nervous if the hardware could be compromised

[08-Sep-18 02:58 AM] jspook16#3059
lol false alarm

[08-Sep-18 02:59 AM] jspook16#3059
it was a test chain just to see if could get it going.

[08-Sep-18 02:59 AM] jspook16#3059
Im going for the real deal now

[08-Sep-18 06:45 AM] jspook16#3059
i should have payload.js locally right?

[08-Sep-18 06:47 AM] jspook16#3059
oh i didnt do that. I installed it from that tar installer on the website

[08-Sep-18 06:49 AM] jspook16#3059
I'll play with it tomorrow

Well yes but it is scary as f.

[09-Sep-18 04:36 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe the recharge is the rewards you would have got if you owned the keys

@Crypto Ali I dont have time to, but the mm2 team is setting things up to be able to support non-bitcoin protocol coins. likely it would help if someone from XMR community helps out, but so far we do not hear from any XMR devs

@jl777c  Hello,   Komodo QT wallet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I tried it, but the wallet takes up a lot of memory.
Open the wallet and wait for more than Ôºàmore than 10 minutesÔºâ.
Is this normal?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The wallet of KMD is too slow to start than other wallets.
If the next version can put data on other disks?

mmm when a ledger is made of private tx im not totally sure of notarisation relevance, sure its needed to secure chain right? but how to proof a tx was done if its only known by the receiver...things start getting counterintuitive with ''z'' in place. Interesting overall will need to join pirate to further check :)

[10-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Daiyox#2701
Unclaimed interest distributed via block rewards, is the mechanism for this documented in some form outside the source code ? I'm mostly curious as to how the block is chosen, If unclaimed rewards exist (beyond the monthly claim period) then is it just a small chance per block some amount will be distributed with the reward ?
