as for physical access, I literally live out in the woods in a town of 600 people in a county of 1500 people, I can't think of a single person who would travel out here, enter the house, and *only* take files

[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] jansako#3330
that is what I am saying, they DID NOT take the file. If they had, you would not have the change address

[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
and why the 100 kmd transaction? right now? If you're here, tell us how you did it.

[31-Oct-18 09:10 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@jansako even less likely is one of those people picking *this* PC and *only* taking KMD

[31-Oct-18 09:11 AM] jansako#3330
Is there another change addy from those 100, and do you have it as well?

[31-Oct-18 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
big ugly orange wallet is open on the server with more BTC than the 29k KMD

[31-Oct-18 09:12 AM] jansako#3330
I am sorry man, I am only going off of logic, do not know anyone there or their skills and  motivations.

`Is there another change addy from those 100, and do you have it as well?`
nope 游땭

[31-Oct-18 09:13 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`do not know anyone there or their skills and motivations.`
ever seen 'Deliverance'?

[31-Oct-18 09:13 AM] jansako#3330
don't remember...

[31-Oct-18 09:13 AM] jansako#3330
but I do come from a small village as well

[31-Oct-18 09:14 AM] jansako#3330
with all the + and - of that environment.

[31-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
wallet.dat change addresses have up to 100 pregenerated

[31-Oct-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
if the change went to a change address in common, this indicates the wallet.dat was compromised

[31-Oct-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
after the keypool is used up, the change addresses will diverge

[31-Oct-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
this does not appear to be a passphrase hack as there is no way the change address would also be compromised

[31-Oct-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so the fact that the change address is known gives very strong indication of what was compromised, just not know

[31-Oct-18 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yeah, the pass thought was only because I was showing 0 balance at the time

[31-Oct-18 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
other than toying with my emotions, I dunno why the coins are being spit into chunks in t addys, though

[31-Oct-18 09:19 AM] jansako#3330
the fact that yo know which one of your wallet.dat's was taken could help

[31-Oct-18 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
was the win10 machine anywhere close?

[31-Oct-18 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes 游땭

[31-Oct-18 09:21 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it was on the 10

[31-Oct-18 09:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
was that the new mobo?

[31-Oct-18 09:23 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
yes

[31-Oct-18 09:25 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
but, the file was copied from win 7 rig, so if it happened before yesterday it was on 7

[31-Oct-18 09:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
fuck, bios exploit, winblows exploit, possibilities are truly endless

[31-Oct-18 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
if only xserver would natively support 3 monitors on 3 nvidia cards....

LOL they sent 3 to binance (I'm guessing to see if they "could", or to toy with me more)

[31-Oct-18 09:44 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

thanks to all that looked, helped with ideas, and/or even thought about helping

I'd be ripping ethernet cables out of walls if it was me.

[31-Oct-18 09:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
now i'm scared

[31-Oct-18 09:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm always scared

[31-Oct-18 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`I'd be ripping ethernet cables out of walls if it was me.`
I was at that point when I 1st got home and saw the 0 balance
....
I live, I hopefully learn, and I start a new day when I awake

[31-Oct-18 09:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
thats why crypto is so fun

[31-Oct-18 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm not putting this in the "fun" category 游땟

when doing a VM on top of/within an encrypted SSD server, is there any additional level of security in regard to hardware backdoors or same exposure? please help security n00b

[31-Oct-18 10:11 AM] snowdamn#2414
still have to deal with spyware, etc., but debating if i should go back to pre-backdoor hardware

[31-Oct-18 10:12 AM] snowdamn#2414

Happy 10 Year Anniversary to bitcoin!

he's speaking about issues with DEXs if anyone is attending

[31-Oct-18 01:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but I think all his concerns are addressed by BarterDEX if they're the same as he wrote in an article a few months ago

yes, need a second machine to do that ASAP
still on graphical environment, but at least not Windows

gives me a thought.... should I try BSD? 游뱂

[31-Oct-18 03:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
freeBSD or openBSD?

[31-Oct-18 03:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's been over a decade I tried BSD

[31-Oct-18 03:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only used it for servers

[31-Oct-18 03:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
never for desktop

[31-Oct-18 04:21 PM] 0x03#8822
depends. if you value security over newer features, deraadts openbsd is for you

[31-Oct-18 04:21 PM] 0x03#8822
if you're after awesome stuff like working zfs and such, it maybe wiser to go for freebsd

[31-Oct-18 04:21 PM] 0x03#8822
i personally would choose netbsd, well knowing about its drawbacks anywhere outside of networking

[31-Oct-18 04:22 PM] 0x03#8822
theres also DragonFly BSD

[31-Oct-18 04:22 PM] 0x03#8822
i never tried it, but people say its not something you'll have to throw away your hdd because of installing it either

[31-Oct-18 04:22 PM] 0x03#8822
so maybe it's worth to check it out

[31-Oct-18 04:23 PM] 0x03#8822
having that said, you work on a OSX right?

[31-Oct-18 04:23 PM] 0x03#8822
half of your OS __Is__ in fact freebsd 游땔

[31-Oct-18 04:28 PM] 0x03#8822
oh, if CoCs mean a lot to you, or the behaviour they _SHOULD_ (but never will) help with, openbsd is wrong for you. do not ever read their mailinglist then :trollface:

[31-Oct-18 04:32 PM] snowdamn#2414
what would be the best setup if someone is absolutely dependent on Agama? 游뱂 
assume effort to get old hardware and/or even installing the free BIOS stuff jok3r recommended

[31-Oct-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`what would be the best setup if someone is absolutely dependent on Agama?`
Windows 7

[31-Oct-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
The problem for anyone like me and picking a flavor of BSD is the exact same as picking any other flavor of linux: xorg sux ass at using more than 1 monitor and they all use it 游땪

[31-Oct-18 04:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I left osx. I'm 100% on linux now.

awesome choice!

[31-Oct-18 05:05 PM] 0x03#8822
however, between linux and a bsd, the gainable advantage for you is very minimal i think

[31-Oct-18 05:05 PM] 0x03#8822
that aside, linux will very well work on your macbook

[31-Oct-18 05:05 PM] 0x03#8822
some even say it's the best laptop hardware for linux, i beg to differ, but some do

[31-Oct-18 05:07 PM] 0x03#8822
@snowdamn bestin terms of what? privacy? security? os-coolness?

[31-Oct-18 05:07 PM] 0x03#8822
you could go with tails live cd or so and just always import the key to the wallet you always install, thats very very private
