`no, it's actually 512/minute clear on btc blocks`
That's literally impossible

[04-Apr-19 01:56 AM] crunchycat#0726
that's why I draw a parallel to POW mining

just fork kmd and get an insane ratio. your coin will pump like madness

my fart was notarized !

[04-Apr-19 01:57 AM] crunchycat#0726
max txns/block for vbk are 256, every 30s

[04-Apr-19 01:57 AM] crunchycat#0726
blocks are filled many times

[04-Apr-19 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s not the point

[04-Apr-19 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
and you know it better than me :D

[04-Apr-19 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the average block is 10 minutes apart and carries like 4200 txes and your claim is that 5120 txes of vbk are in every block

[04-Apr-19 01:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
you are the block

[04-Apr-19 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you even math, bruh?

[04-Apr-19 01:59 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay 256 on every single block in a span of 10m might not happen, but it happens on many blocks

[04-Apr-19 01:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
how much "many" do you estimate is enough ?

[04-Apr-19 01:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh the back-peddle

[04-Apr-19 01:59 AM] crunchycat#0726
my point is much greater security by the much greater number of txns is given

[04-Apr-19 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[04-Apr-19 02:00 AM] crunchycat#0726
when fees are high the economics don't allow 256 txns/block

[04-Apr-19 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok is a shortcut :p

[04-Apr-19 02:00 AM] crunchycat#0726
like right now, not all vbk blocks haven txns

[04-Apr-19 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`my point is much greater security by the much greater number of txns is given`
explain to me how 1000 txes in a block, containing the same information, is "more secure" than 1, 10, or 100....

[04-Apr-19 02:01 AM] crunchycat#0726
1000 independent sources of a piece of information is more secure than 1

it's clear to me that it's not

if you tell me vbk is superior cause anyone can ntrz. here yeah maybe you got something. but you can t just see the mess it could become.

[04-Apr-19 02:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you *need* 2, then your model is flawed

[04-Apr-19 02:04 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Deleted User  yes anyone can notarize

at least fight for pros, and not cons lol

"trust my code, I let you talk to it"

[04-Apr-19 02:04 AM] crunchycat#0726
The closed source argument is a cop-out

[04-Apr-19 02:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@crunchycat  its 3x cheaper in BTC costs, cheaper costs on third party chains , and less tx on btc chain.

[04-Apr-19 02:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s not even a question of DPoW is better

[04-Apr-19 02:05 AM] crunchycat#0726
you know what's much cheaper than BTC in POW costs?  One thousand other shitcoins

[04-Apr-19 02:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The closed source argument is a cop-out`
Explain the position that it's a "cop-out" to not believe that something is secure just because some random person says "trust me it is".....

Pointing to the fact that something hasn't been open-sourced when they clearly intend to is a cop-out.  I hear what you're saying "I've seen this a hundred time" and all, but this isn't some fly-by-night shitcoin we're talking about here

I’ve been hearing Coinomi going to open source for going on 2 years now

it might be and we wouldn't be able to tell the difference at this point

`but this isn't some fly-by-night shitcoin we're talking about here`
as evidenced by....

What do you guys think about Safecoin ? Apparently they offer a double spend proof solution without POP mining like VBK or expensive fees per year like KMD. I don't know a lot about this project

[04-Apr-19 02:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Safecoin lol

[04-Apr-19 02:08 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay then, so when it's all open-sourced I can come back here and everyone will apologize profusely to me?

[04-Apr-19 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`What do you guys think about Safecoin ? `
even a dumbass like me can bork everything they do

[04-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
SAFE has twice now tweeted something along the lines of "we're making great progress, here look at these notarizations" then linked to things that they *thought* were notarizations

[04-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
which shows their lack of understanding

[04-Apr-19 02:09 AM] Alright#0419
both times, what they linked to was not notarizations

[04-Apr-19 02:09 AM] crunchycat#0726
I don't know much about Safe

[04-Apr-19 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_will bet 5BTC that he can get that chain to rollback_

[04-Apr-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, if you're thinking about investing in SAFE, please do some research on their numerous rollbacks

[04-Apr-19 02:10 AM] crunchycat#0726
wtf Safe man

[04-Apr-19 02:10 AM] crunchycat#0726
I posted an article talking about KMD devs attacking it, that's all

[04-Apr-19 02:10 AM] Alright#0419
SAFE is another project planning to use dpow tech

[04-Apr-19 02:11 AM] Alright#0419
@Zbouby asked a valid question man

ew @Deleted User uses lite mode discord

`I posted an article talking about KMD devs attacking it, that's all`
and now I know I ws right about what I said to start with; tell jeff and jeff both that I said hi 👋🏽

[04-Apr-19 02:11 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay guys, nobody wants to put forth a convincing shill of KMD to me.  That's cool, I'll be on my way.  I'm sure your devs will post when I'm not available to respond

[04-Apr-19 02:11 AM] Zbouby#6066
Thank you for your answers

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] crunchycat#0726
also @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I don't know any jeff.  Assuming this is a Safe person so...

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
@crunchycat dpow has been battle tested for ~2 years now, VBK has nothing to show for itself tech wise atm

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
we can't really say anything until we see the code

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Alright point taken

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] Regnar#6164
although technically lite can be the right word 😛

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ew @Emmanuel uses lite mode discord`
untill the force the new update on him 😛

[04-Apr-19 02:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We can say it economically unsound , that’s obvious

[04-Apr-19 02:13 AM] crunchycat#0726
So you'd say BTC is economically unsound due to POW costs?>

[04-Apr-19 02:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@crunchycat Either you are lying or you "posted an article" that you used 4th party info in and contacted no one involved 🤔

[04-Apr-19 02:13 AM] crunchycat#0726
lol, the latter

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
not that interested in Safe to verify all information I post about it

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] Regnar#6164
```So you'd say BTC is economically unsound due to POW costs?``` Nope.

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
figured I'd ask here

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the latter`
that explains a lot about your positions 🤦🏽

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@crunchycat  your missing the point,  why would someone pay Veriblock much more for the same service as DPoW

[04-Apr-19 02:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Regnar so BTC pow is justified due to the security it imparts, but "other" coins are not?

[04-Apr-19 02:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
Also shitcoins don't pay VBK, they pay pop miners (you and me) to secure their chain to VBK

[04-Apr-19 02:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
and they don't actually pay, they allocate a portion of their block rewards

[04-Apr-19 02:15 AM] Regnar#6164
```so BTC pow is justified due to the security it imparts, but "other" coins are not?``` I suggest you don't put words in other people's mouths, I did not say that.

[04-Apr-19 02:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
whatever they deem sufficient

[04-Apr-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
We've seen this situation many times before (SAFE, BLOCK, TAU to name a few). We see a project claim incredibly bold things then say "trust us it'll be great", and we're left disappointed every single time.

[04-Apr-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
until we can actually validate their claims, it's not something worth discussing IMO

[04-Apr-19 02:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
@Regnar fair enough, so tell me how more notrizations is not more secure (and not wasteful) compared to much less notarizations

[04-Apr-19 02:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay, again fair enough

[04-Apr-19 02:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
closed source

[04-Apr-19 02:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'll be back when they open source it

[04-Apr-19 02:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
“and they don't actually pay, they allocate a portion of their block rewards”. ———That is still paying

[04-Apr-19 02:19 AM] Regnar#6164
first and foremost, a notarization is only a notarization if it is included in a block. Which means a block is what secures the notarization. The number of notarizations per block doesn't matter because if you were to compromise the security of the block itself (a 51% on Bitcoin, which we agree isn't likely) then it doesn't matter how many notarizations were included in that block, it's gone. 
So therefore more notarizations in a single block aren't any more secure than a single notarization per block.

a 51% on a btc block isn't the concern, the concern is a 51% on KMD

` the concern is a 51% on KMD`
then do it and prove us all to be wrong and mislead
