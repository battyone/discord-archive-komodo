PIRATE is part of the ecosystem

[30-Oct-18 01:57 PM] cammofunk#7832
All I know is that kmd can create "limitless" amount of sidechains, and those chains can have their own sidechains. Is pirate one of those? I don't understand what a runtime fork is sorry

[30-Oct-18 01:57 PM] cammofunk#7832
@jl777c ^

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
you probably dont understand the technical definition of sidechain

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] cammofunk#7832
Its its own blockchain

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
you can use a fuzzy definition if sidechain to understand PIRATE

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
runtime fork

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
independent chain

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
assetchain

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
parallel chain

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
many names can be used

[30-Oct-18 01:58 PM] cammofunk#7832
but kmd is still the chain it connects too?

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] cammofunk#7832
like the os

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] cammofunk#7832
of sorts

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an independent chain but it using komodod

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] cammofunk#7832
makes sense

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] cammofunk#7832
so almost like its first app?

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE GUI is agama

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
which brings in more KMD users

[30-Oct-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810

@Deleted User heard about this

[30-Oct-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
in a sense the runtime forks are komodod dapps

it is an interesting way to look at runtime forks

[30-Oct-18 02:01 PM] cammofunk#7832
Thanks for the lesson haha, I'm so pumped for kmd to be honest

Kmd is like the ocean @cammofunk ... you can launch a dingy, Pirate Ship of just break out your flippers and snorkel 
Many use cases, each has its benefits, but KMD is the support mechanism

[30-Oct-18 02:04 PM] cammofunk#7832
@jl777c any mention on roughly when this will happen?

[30-Oct-18 02:04 PM] cammofunk#7832
@house Lol like vr or something? That confuses me xD

[30-Oct-18 02:05 PM] house#8741

everything in Komodo ecosystem happens on tuesday @cammofunk

[30-Oct-18 02:08 PM] cammofunk#7832
@crumb like there's an even this tuesday? or are tuesdays update days?

[30-Oct-18 02:08 PM] cammofunk#7832

[30-Oct-18 02:09 PM] crumb#2550
99.99% not this tuesday, but still tuesday:trollface:

[30-Oct-18 02:11 PM] cammofunk#7832
@crumb Lol I take it there's a vague post somewhere that just says tuesday?

[30-Oct-18 02:11 PM] crumb#2550
no offence cammofunk, but seems that you are not familiar with the actual tech. please read the Komodo whitepaper and if you thought you were *pumped* before, it'll blow you away

[30-Oct-18 02:11 PM] crumb#2550
tuesday is the Komodo thing

[30-Oct-18 02:12 PM] crumb#2550
as the 42 is always the right answer to everything and 7:77 AM/PM is always the right time

question can one address with and utxo of 1000 sat of komodo be spendable now as one input and two output and what about one address with one utxo 1000 sat and another utxo 90 sat komodo.....

[30-Oct-18 02:37 PM] plazma#1625
(noob question)

[30-Oct-18 02:37 PM] plazma#1625
plz

[30-Oct-18 02:49 PM] house#8741
@plazma 
(Noob response)
What is the value of a kmd transaction ?
If > 1000 sats would it be worth it be worth making the transaction at all ?
If < 1000 sats would it be warranted to break such minuscule amount into two outputs?

[30-Oct-18 02:50 PM] plazma#1625
yep @house so whats the minimun dust transaction possible and any solution to dusting attack on one address.....

[30-Oct-18 02:55 PM] house#8741
Suggest minimum (sensible) dust tx would be >= fee amount but I would ass u me a smaller amount tan the fee would be possible (disclaimer: is only a guess)
Re:dusting attack ... is above my pay grade but aside from ‚Äúwho cares about dust‚Äù any attack should be addressed for sure

or anyone free right now with advance tech knowledge.....

[30-Oct-18 03:03 PM] house#8741
@plazma what is a dusting attack ?

[30-Oct-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
z_mergetoaddress can be used to combine dust

[30-Oct-18 03:05 PM] plazma#1625
@house the specific attack works by sending small amounts of funds to a wide range of addresses, and then watching the movement of those funds on the blockchain. When those inputs are combined with other addresses, the addresses are linked together, allowing attackers to group addresses and move closer to de-anonymizing users

[30-Oct-18 03:06 PM] plazma#1625
(;-P straight from internet.....lol)

[30-Oct-18 03:06 PM] plazma#1625
@jl777c thanks...can u explain a bit plz....

[30-Oct-18 03:07 PM] plazma#1625
about z_mergetoaddress

[30-Oct-18 03:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
HMMM seems you could just use z_mergetoaddress and send them to a Z address, effectivly making them dissapear

[30-Oct-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp#L4125

I added some changes to the RPC specifically for cleaning dust

@plazma so is like blockchain spyware ?

[30-Oct-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you give it a value of min size and it merges everythng under that size

[30-Oct-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should merge to z address aswell so the clean is untracable

[30-Oct-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, send to zaddr and thank attacker for the donation

[30-Oct-18 03:14 PM] plazma#1625
@blackjok3r thanks, does this mean it can be used as multiple komodo t address with small funds combined as a coinjoin to a z address with z_mergetoaddress

[30-Oct-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes that function of mine will take all utxo's under the size you specify in your wallet and send them to one address.

[30-Oct-18 03:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the normal one, doesnt have a size you can specify, just takes all utxo in wallet in all address and sends to 1 address

[30-Oct-18 03:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems the size parameter can be even more imprtant in case of this attack as well, I should get it merged to komodo. I forgot about it.

[30-Oct-18 03:18 PM] plazma#1625
more fun will come if a mixer pop up who takes no fee or small fee uses tor or kovri takes all input joins as one z address takes z address from everyone and give them their funds.....tara....chainanalysis gone out of business....

who in this world know any masternode developers?

[30-Oct-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
why just use an AC with rewards CC ü§∑  then you dont need a developer

[30-Oct-18 04:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
interesting - so actualyl if you send 0.00000000001 ZEC hundred/thousand of times to a user - he may have problem using his wallet - processing hundreds  utxos will take few hours / days ?

[30-Oct-18 04:27 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
that's why fees are needed not to spam network ?

[30-Oct-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[30-Oct-18 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
@CryptoCurrencyAcademy @blackjok3r and I made MN-esque system for #kmdlabs

[30-Oct-18 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
Also rewards cc, like joker said is a *very* simple way to achieve the same thing as most MN systems

[30-Oct-18 05:16 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
but still for 1Arrr you could make 10k utxo to 1 user you like to block (if you know his z addr)

[30-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
yea, it'll only take your CPU a year to do the math though

[30-Oct-18 05:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
the receiver will take long time to process, sender should be good if sending from single utxo. My laptop is avg and makes 60 sec send, so for 10k needs 10k minutes = about a week üòÉ but imagine if someone's got a botnet or superpower computer

[30-Oct-18 05:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is processing time of 2 utxo = 2 processing time of 1 utxo ?

[30-Oct-18 05:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or nonlinear?

[30-Oct-18 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã the sender pays the z xtn tax, the receiver doesn't need much CPU at all

[30-Oct-18 05:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you are DoS'ing yourself via CPU and paying txfees for a slight inconvenience to some other user

[30-Oct-18 05:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I see, and what about linearity? 2 utxo sending time =2 times of sending one ?

[30-Oct-18 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[30-Oct-18 05:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can only send to a max of 54 zaddrs at once in Sprout, and each adds the same amount of time to the transaction (each one requires a JoinSplit)
