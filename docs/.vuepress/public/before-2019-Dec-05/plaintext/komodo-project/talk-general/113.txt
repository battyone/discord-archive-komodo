How can we help you?

[23-Oct-18 09:26 PM] dotunwilfred#5704
i want to inquire about the komodo ambassador program

[23-Oct-18 09:30 PM] dotunwilfred#5704

[23-Oct-18 09:48 PM] Hermes#6934
I would suggest sending an email to support@komodoplatform.com and it will be forwarded to the department in charge of this. Also you could ask in #komodo-team  but I think we have forum already with the latest bounties and job positions https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/jobs-bounties

@dotunwilfred  Still if you want send the email and we will forward it to marketing to have it recorded .

ok, thanks

[23-Oct-18 10:58 PM] DingDongSoLong#0148
Man I feel like I keep having problems with native mode. For some reason I can’t activate KMD on native mode, it keeps saying “error starting KMD daemon. Port  is already taken” what does that mean?

[23-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Torankoku#4818
KMD got mentioned on crypto slate. Nice going guys

@DingDongSoLong  Also make sure that Komodod is not running in the background...check the task manager and kill the process if you see it while Agama is shut down

[24-Oct-18 12:21 AM] DingDongSoLong#0148
@Hermes  where’s task manager located at?

It depends on where you would like to start

[24-Oct-18 12:47 AM] Hermes#6934
Decentralized exchange , Komodo is the first one in doing an atomic swap

[24-Oct-18 12:48 AM] Hermes#6934
Recently now we have the Crypto Conditions or CC smart contracts....just being developed you can see this being done by our core team at #cc-general

[24-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Hermes#6934
There are lots of things happening ...Komodo has it's own platform and many assetchains have been created for different purposes...people are coming to mine some ARRRR and also KMDICE

[24-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Hermes#6934
is a good moment to have noticed Komodo honestly if it's your first time

How can a DEX block IP's 😂  Its clearly not a DEX 🤣

[24-Oct-18 02:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Couldn't a seed node have a whitelist?

[24-Oct-18 02:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just asking ... for a friend 😇

[24-Oct-18 02:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm for netid0 probably... but you can just create a new netid (using abrterdex that is) I assume once we move to a better p2p netowrk with MM2.0 then its porbably not posible at all.

[24-Oct-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
similar to torrents... if 1 seed blocks you there are more seeds.

[24-Oct-18 02:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes it wouldn't stop the customer from getting it from a seed node that would accept them but it would allow a provider to be selective in who they deal with.

[24-Oct-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can always change your IP ... current marketmaker wouldnt let you do that, but with a better network stack it wouldbe be an issue...

[24-Oct-18 06:24 AM] ch6ris#5240

[24-Oct-18 06:53 AM] ch6ris#5240
And coinbase listed it why?

[24-Oct-18 07:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Probably had bags

[24-Oct-18 07:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or viewed it as a way to allow access to coinbase via shitcoin trading

[24-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
did't know that

[24-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
also why does it take 120 confirmations

[24-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
its stuck at 20

[24-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
how does KMD have a nationality?

Maybe he is from the future and Putin accepted KMD as the new Ruble

[24-Oct-18 12:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
interesting! I'd also like to know if someone can tell me where exactly Bitcoin is from 😄

[24-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c the blockexplorer I got redirected to is on a .ru address

[24-Oct-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Tek you might want to provide some context

[24-Oct-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`why does it take 120 confirmations`
?

[24-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Tek#5253
I sent KMD to binance and it takes 120 confirmations

[24-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Tek#5253
really slow too

[24-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Tek#5253
been waiting quite a while now

[24-Oct-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
120 is a random number pulled from someone's ass to ensure that no ds occurs on most chains (binance makes no exception for KMD even though 120 is overkill)

{Reactions}
👌 

[24-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Tek#5253
its at 44/120 now after an hour of waiting

[24-Oct-18 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
120 confirms takes 2 hrs *on average*

[24-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Tek#5253
tfw

[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, bittrex takes only 30 confs

[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
yeah. I'm on bittrex too but I'm moving to binance

[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Tek#5253
I hate bittrex

[24-Oct-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the domain of one of the explorers means that explorer is in the .ru domain

[24-Oct-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
says nothing about any nationality of KMD

[24-Oct-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
there are some explorers on the .info domain, that doesnt mean KMD nationality is info

{Reactions}
👆🏼 

[24-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Tek#5253
k

[24-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Tek#5253
well then maybe binance should link to a general domain block explorer instead of a .ru one to confuse people right

[24-Oct-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
.ru is a "general" domain

[24-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
whatever

[24-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
.ru doesn't make it any popular with the normies

[24-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
this is just marketing alrite

the .ru explorer has been the most reliable explorer, historically

[24-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
im fine with it I just was confused for a second and thought KMD was a russian project

[24-Oct-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
