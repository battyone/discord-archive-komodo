i just got off phone to perth mint and infini gold and asked them why they didnt use komodo for the new govt backed gold token. i think i drove them mad

[30-Oct-19 05:08 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
sounds like they are having a hard time finding an exchange market maker solution that ticks all the boxes

[30-Oct-19 05:24 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
maybe kmd should contact them ?

[30-Oct-19 05:25 AM] 74D30#6106
Online Precious Metals dealers accepting KMD would boost market cap and volume. Most only accept BCH or BTC currently

does komodo still hold QRL in their portfolio ? also what protection does kmd have for quantum supremacy ?

[30-Oct-19 05:38 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
which google now claims to have a breakthrough !!

[30-Oct-19 05:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That is the Supernet portfolio ,  and I‚Äôm not sure I think it may have been liquidated earlier not sure .   Re: Quantum resistance , Komodo has created a CC module that requires an additional Dilithium signature for a tx to be valid.   This is not active yet on mainchain, namely because even google‚Äôs advancement is no where near the qubits needed to break the current digital signature scheme

{Reactions}

[30-Oct-19 05:46 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
how many qubits  is needed to break it ?

[30-Oct-19 05:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I read around 1500

[30-Oct-19 05:49 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

qrl claims to be 100% quantum proof

[30-Oct-19 05:51 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Easy to claim when what is being claimed is protection from an attacker that doesn‚Äôt exist yet

[30-Oct-19 05:52 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
well, yeh also we dont know how advanced google really is also

[30-Oct-19 05:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
You mentioned the Australian govt was look to do a gold backed coin,  what requirements did they have or where can I find out.

[30-Oct-19 05:53 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

i just got off phone with them

[30-Oct-19 05:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I imagine at best they are an order of magnitude better than what they say so 500ish qubits still pretty far away.  Maybe in the next decade it will be close

[30-Oct-19 05:55 AM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

it is very strange that in its review of existing DEX JL777 did not mention the Bitshares exchange which by the way is fully working and has some kind of liquidity and is many steps ahead of many exchanges from the article and also meets all 4 requirements, for example, it does not store user funds centrally and so on
My question is whether it was done intentionally, or in order not to mention a competitor, because they have long implemented smart assets secured and very fast graphene technology! What can be said about this exchange? And why didn‚Äôt it be included in the review?
