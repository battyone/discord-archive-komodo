That is what the Utrum portal will be about

[04-Jan-19 03:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Sri or @Deleted User can explain it better for you.

[04-Jan-19 03:36 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok good so go Utrum, go!

[04-Jan-19 03:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I means sth that could be updated weekly like a per-project page

[04-Jan-19 03:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
with info like "funds raised, people interested (count or some categories/groups specified), ... other usefull data to estimate project importance, estimated work needed per / module/part/milestone"

[04-Jan-19 03:38 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sth simple and clear

[04-Jan-19 03:39 PM] jorian#4555
that sounds like something a community manager would have as tool

[04-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
you can also judge this by looking at the ecosystem projects

[04-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
and see how much is going on

[04-Jan-19 03:40 PM] jorian#4555
discord is probably the only place where this is measured. reddit is kind of dead

[04-Jan-19 03:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no chat channels are not good for this

[04-Jan-19 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
chat is not even a forum

[04-Jan-19 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
chats good to talk about current issues or just for fun

[04-Jan-19 03:41 PM] jorian#4555
the komodo platform website is static, but i think something is in the works of showcasing projects. but probably not to be updated regularly

[04-Jan-19 03:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not good to estiamte anything based on that

[04-Jan-19 03:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"regular updates" are like tweets on cmc KMD page

[04-Jan-19 03:42 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
not a big deal to make 1 tweet a week

[04-Jan-19 03:43 PM] jorian#4555

I dont want it. I just see it will bring more clarity and maybe more progress 😛

[04-Jan-19 04:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a simple solution to highlight any and all KMD projects is expecting KMD based projects to do an ANN post on Komodo forum

I guess if it becomes some practice with Komodo ecosystem projects, it'd be very helpful to whole ecosystem

kidding but you know what I mean

[04-Jan-19 06:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually if every project has twitter and make some interesting twitts once a week and those would be displayed on KMD/projects

[04-Jan-19 06:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
could be good too

[04-Jan-19 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
so you're saying this isn't a problem with KMD but with the projects? :trollface:

[05-Jan-19 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, I think even I'd labs had some kind of feed somewhere with important things, you would get maybe some more interest. Github feed is great, most ppl don't look at it tho, or I guess understand what it is

[05-Jan-19 09:34 PM] ch6ris#5240
What’s the big deal about Ethereum?
 Ethereum has a lot of features that people find compelling. Let’s explore.Ethereum makes it possible to...
 
Run apps
Rather than pay a big company to run your app, Ethereum lets you host it on thousands of computers around the world.
    
Create magic swords
Well, digital ones anyway. Ethereum can be used to create digital items for video games that are tradeable outside of the game itself.
    
Pay for things
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency too. You can use it to pay for everything on the Ethereum network.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Create new cryptocurrencies
Ethereum lets developers create new cryptocurrencies, called tokens, that can be stored in app like Coinbase Wallet.
    
Code your money
Let’s say a charity wants to send money to a thousand people every day for a year. With Ethereum, it only takes a few lines of code.
Interested in Ethereum? Check out the price and learn more today.

Komodo needs to get in bed with this shady company. Just use protection. maybe double wrap.

There have been rumors of a possible chain reorganization or double spend attack.

From what we can tell the ETC network is operating normally. 

BlockScout's "Reorg" section shows nothing of the sort.

I read somewhere that the ETC project stopped because lack of funds. It's still on exchanges though

[07-Jan-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the chain is being mined...

[07-Jan-19 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then its beinfg mined and it works

[07-Jan-19 11:33 AM] mrbizzy#7075
yea, if you look back in time, many projects were born and many have vanished. ETC did not have anything unique so..  adios

isn't this old news? about ETC?

like really old

[07-Jan-19 12:07 PM] Honeybadger#5573
ETC lost a lot of developers it seems with their developer arm going bankrupt. It has been a severe blow to be honest.

[07-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Arboreal#3777
well, I never understood a point of having such a fork

[07-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Arboreal#3777
so I don't really mourn the loss

[07-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Honeybadger#5573
You have been a long time Komodo follower @Arboreal ? Or just someone who loves privacy tech as a whole?

[07-Jan-19 12:22 PM] Arboreal#3777
nah, I am just starting out, but I am big on 1) platforms of all kinds 2) privacy and decentralized tech 3) dogecoin

[07-Jan-19 12:58 PM] Honeybadger#5573
You must be an old hand than @Arboreal  ? 
Currently in terms of Privacy tech, besides Komodo I am really looking towards AZTEC and their implementation for ETH privacy. 

I have been a XMR stalwart though but slowly converted and started appreciating Zero knowledge proofs. : )

We can confirm that there was a successful 51% attack on the Ethereum Classic (#ETC) network with multiple 100+ block reorganization. We recommend all services to closely monitored the chain and significantly increase required confirmations.

Contradicting reports from the Ethereum Classic camp, cryptocurrency exchange giant Coinbase announced this afternoon that the apparent ETC blockchain reorganization attack had been accompanied by around half a million dollars in double spends.    The San Francisco-based

[07-Jan-19 08:31 PM] Acura#2748
when dPoW 😎

[07-Jan-19 08:48 PM] dokrates#8987
to avoid dpow in a 51% attack, the 51% must include a hash superior to current bitcoin  hash, am i right?

[07-Jan-19 08:49 PM] dokrates#8987
it also means, nobody will do a 51% attack to ETC because he/she can do directly into btc

[07-Jan-19 08:49 PM] Ludom#5832
😃

[07-Jan-19 08:50 PM] dokrates#8987
so if nobody does a 51% attack to bitcoin never, dpow works amazingly perfect

[07-Jan-19 08:50 PM] dokrates#8987
we can say, the moment when dpow is avoided, the entire bitcoin network will be unsecure

[07-Jan-19 08:50 PM] dokrates#8987
then the apocalipsis for crypto

[07-Jan-19 08:50 PM] dokrates#8987
XD

[07-Jan-19 08:50 PM] dokrates#8987
am i right in all statements?

[07-Jan-19 08:52 PM] PTYX#6840
Are you trying to say that if bitcoin is overpowered, dpow would be unsecure?

[07-Jan-19 08:52 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes, but reorg can be done between the ancorage in Bitcoin

[07-Jan-19 08:53 PM] dokrates#8987
@PTYX exactly

[07-Jan-19 08:53 PM] Ludom#5832
But a 51% attack on Komodo needs 51% of the notaries nodes

[07-Jan-19 08:53 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah, it would be more complex than just reorging btc I would think.

[07-Jan-19 08:54 PM] Ludom#5832
If Bitcoin has security problems, we can ancore on other chain

[07-Jan-19 08:54 PM] dokrates#8987
but the biggest hashrate is into bitcoin, so as much hashrate more secure will be dpow

[07-Jan-19 08:55 PM] PTYX#6840
If btc is taken over, I don't see much point notarizing unto another pow chain

[07-Jan-19 08:55 PM] PTYX#6840
You'd probably want something like verushash with 50% pos 50% pow. I could be wrong though.

[07-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Ludom#5832
If Bitcoin is taken over, crypto will have more problems as security of dPoW

[07-Jan-19 08:57 PM] Ludom#5832
Bitcoin can't have hashrate problem with such price.

[07-Jan-19 08:58 PM] PTYX#6840
:PeepoThink:

[07-Jan-19 08:58 PM] dokrates#8987
the problem for hashrate into bitcoin, could increase if price goes below 500$ for example right?

[07-Jan-19 08:58 PM] dokrates#8987
many farms will shutdown, reducing also difficulty

[07-Jan-19 08:59 PM] dokrates#8987
reduced difficulty, reduced hashrate, more probabilities to start a 51% attack

[07-Jan-19 08:59 PM] dokrates#8987
meanwhile the price keeps high, or at least over 1000$, it will be profitable, so we will see enough hashrate to avoid 51%
