or to charge higher PoP fees by delaying transactions

[27-Mar-19 03:30 AM] crunchycat#0726
A VBK pop miner is totally separate than an altcoin/shitcoin pop miner

[27-Mar-19 03:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes i understand that, but the lower tier mining system has to create value for the high tier VBK to BTC notarizations

[27-Mar-19 03:31 AM] bishop#9773
So @crunchycat when you said you were researching VBK and KMD, you basically already knew you wanted VBK and now you are trying to poke holes in KMD's platform instead of being unbias, right

[27-Mar-19 03:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'm well aware of both projects

[27-Mar-19 03:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
but it's been a while since I've read the KMD whitepaper

[27-Mar-19 03:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
so I was asking legit quetsions

[27-Mar-19 03:32 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Reading the kmd whitepaper is an accomplishment 😂

[27-Mar-19 03:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
It was actually pretty good, went over the BTC basics really well

[27-Mar-19 03:33 AM] bishop#9773
really came off as more trolling than anything to be honest. There are plenty of people here willing to answer questions

[27-Mar-19 03:33 AM] PTYX#6840
From an unbiased standpoint, I can see a usecase for VBK but saying their system is better than Komodo's is a misplaced opinion. Komodo secures tens of blockchains already at minimal cost and it has a sustainable model to keep notaries notarizing.

[27-Mar-19 03:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
I see your point

[27-Mar-19 03:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
But my opinion on this is the same reason I like BTC vs some of the POS stuff.  VBK is decentralized, trustless, transparent, and permissionless.  These are all strengths in my eyes.  That's why my questions were directed at the lack of those qualities in many respects with KMD

[27-Mar-19 03:36 AM] PTYX#6840
decentralization is a spectrum

[27-Mar-19 03:36 AM] PTYX#6840
and as far as I can tell, Komodo is trustless, open source, transparent

[27-Mar-19 03:37 AM] PTYX#6840
there has to be parameters to adding coins to the network. it's not exclusive. if you have the knowhow, make the gitpull requests, pay the fee and get added.

[27-Mar-19 03:37 AM] PTYX#6840
if not, pay a service provider to do it for you. there are options

[27-Mar-19 03:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
fair enough, but 64 notaries voted in by the size of people's bags is a far cry from just anybody being able to pop mine or "notarize"

[27-Mar-19 03:38 AM] PTYX#6840
let's see how vbk performs when it has 1000 chains before we start making comparisons

[27-Mar-19 03:38 AM] PTYX#6840
what we see as qualities could be weaknesses in the longrun

Unclear, please expand on this point.

[27-Mar-19 03:39 AM] crunchycat#0726
KMD in essence has 64 nodes that notarize, while VBK has as many as want to

[27-Mar-19 03:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'm "notarizing" right now

[27-Mar-19 03:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
didn't have to be voted in

[27-Mar-19 03:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
good for ya, the 64 notary nodes is doing spending of the BTC efficiently.
Glad there's another solution in market as option to chose by other project. ignoring the expensiveness of it's nature.

[27-Mar-19 03:41 AM] crunchycat#0726
you guys should drop in that VBK discord and ask away, prob guys in there that could explain the system way better than I

[27-Mar-19 03:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[27-Mar-19 04:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So Cat, you pay BTC for their notarization costs in exchange for their VBK token?  Why not buy it?  At what point in the economics will this make sense?  Will they be notarizing to any random chain they please down the road because game theoory lovers will love to play this system you describe above, and from what it sounds like, it could be easily exploitable?  Not excited to read all about VBK but I will see if I can find some time in the next week or two.

*crunchycatToday at 7:39 PM*
`lol maybe they incorrectly assumed guys knowledgable about all the details of the KMD code wouldn't get in the wreck the place?` 

It's irresponsible what they did, Why would ANY dev assume that noone will mess with their shit?  That's just stupid.  

Also, if you watched it play out as it happened, the safe guys were cocky and condescending from the start.  They were assumpitve and accusatory.  Asking someone to "stop attacking their chain" when it's not even an attack, is just laughable at best, and recklessly irresponsible at worst.

[27-Mar-19 04:54 AM] crunchycat#0726
@FishyGuts thanks for the reply.  I wasn't aware of Safecoin or the attack at the time, so just going by what I've read.

[27-Mar-19 04:55 AM] crunchycat#0726
As for buying VBK instead of mining for it, well I guess that goes for every single mineable coin in existence

[27-Mar-19 04:55 AM] crunchycat#0726
You mine when it makes financial sense, and buy when the same

[27-Mar-19 04:57 AM] crunchycat#0726
Remains to be seen how exploitable VBK will be, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say 3 yrs development and backing by some of the heavyweights in the industry will make it pretty resilient

[27-Mar-19 04:58 AM] crunchycat#0726
Also yes, I'm gonna predict hundreds of shitcoins being secured by it.  Probably quite a few reputable ones that have experienced 51% attacks as well.  Time will tell

[27-Mar-19 04:58 AM] crunchycat#0726
And good to have competition between VBK/KMD

[27-Mar-19 05:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I do have to read into it.   From what I have read so far, the VBK notarization fees are far more than the KMD fees.

[27-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Regnar#6164
Are all PoP miners making transactions on bitcoin with high fees to try and get them included over others?

[27-Mar-19 05:12 AM] crunchycat#0726
they are using the minimum fee to be in the next btc block that clears prefereably

[27-Mar-19 05:12 AM] crunchycat#0726
rewards drop something like 80% going from the next btc block to the one after that

[27-Mar-19 05:13 AM] Regnar#6164
and is it a race between pop miners to get into next block?

[27-Mar-19 05:13 AM] crunchycat#0726
basically yes.  But if 30 pop miners for a given VBK block (every 30s avg) are all on the next btc block, rewards are split evenly

[27-Mar-19 05:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
so the number of pop miners, and the fees they use, are only justified by the rewards they receive.  If BTC fees rage and/or VBK value is reduced, there will be less pop miners

[27-Mar-19 05:14 AM] Regnar#6164
but that's 30 btc transactions being made at the same time, to verify the same data?

[27-Mar-19 05:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
yse

[27-Mar-19 05:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes

[27-Mar-19 05:14 AM] crunchycat#0726
more security

[27-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Regnar#6164
how would putting the same data in the same block multiple times equal more security?

[27-Mar-19 05:15 AM] crunchycat#0726
and a VBK block every 30s, instead of KMD which is 10 minutes isn't it?

[27-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Regnar#6164
1 minute, bitcoin is 10 minutes

[27-Mar-19 05:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
So to attack a shitcoin you'd literally have to attack the shitcoin chain, the VBK chain, the BTC chain, and outnumber all those popminers pop mining the altchain, as well as the VBK chain.

[27-Mar-19 05:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
And the pop mining of the altchain and VBK chain are visible, so can't be hidden like an attacker would do with a 51% attack

[27-Mar-19 05:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I understand how that works

[27-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm asking when pop miners mine to BTC

[27-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Regnar#6164
do they all race to include the same hash data into the next block?

[27-Mar-19 05:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
This is actually what they'll use to provide a service to exchanges so they can see in real time if there's an attack in process, and increase confirmations also in real time

[27-Mar-19 05:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
for your Q, yes

[27-Mar-19 05:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
also nice profile pic, lol

[27-Mar-19 05:18 AM] Regnar#6164
so you could have 30 pop miners sending txs on bitcoin having the same hash data to be included in the same block. They get a reward in VBK for having their tx included, and that reward is split evenly among the miners who were included in the most recent block

[27-Mar-19 05:18 AM] Regnar#6164
thanks

[27-Mar-19 05:19 AM] crunchycat#0726
yep

[27-Mar-19 05:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that sounds crazy inefficient lol

[27-Mar-19 05:21 AM] Regnar#6164
I mean if miners are willing to spend their own coins, w.e.

[27-Mar-19 05:37 AM] Regnar#6164
but 17.46% of all BTC transactions are Veriblock, including all these duplicates? that seems like it needs a lot of work to make it sustainable. My other concern would be this entire system is essentially tied to the volatility of two different chains, and the market values of two different coins.

Some thoughts:
1. the price of VBK. if the price of VBK expected rewards (1/n of PoP miners) is less than the cost of a tx fee, it hurts the economics, though sure people will mine at a loss for a bit expecting a price recovery. The system is entirely betting on (1/n expected PoP rewards > BTC tx fees). The assumption is an increase in BTC fees means decrease in PoP miners (increase in PoP reward share), but still relies on VBK value not declining at the same time.

2. If scenario 1 happens and you have a decrease in PoP miners because of the costs, you essentially are putting the 51% attack protection in the hands of a few pop miners who could be malicious. If worst case scenario 1 (meaning VBK price decreases as BTC tx fees go up, think BTC bullrun) then you have even fewer miners (if any)

Last measure I saw showed Veriblock miners had spent 72 BTC on just transaction fees in a month, roughly $300k USD, what is the value of a VBK?

[27-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Regnar#6164
I guess it can remain profitable to do for PoP miners if VBK price stays above $0.08, market cap of $21.9M. Basing this on 26.56 avg PoP miners splitting a reward of 136.98. so 5.15 VBK each and if we assume BTC tx fee is $0.40 (+OP_Return BTC)

[27-Mar-19 06:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery... dPOW is eco-friendly, and adds value to the btc blockchain. The Veriblock guys are doing a whole marketing push for dPOW at no cost to kmd. I should join their discord and thank them for their hard work.

[27-Mar-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
VBK cost to a chain ~1% of mining rewards, which will end up being 1% of the coins marketcap. To say that VBK is cheaper than dPoW is to say that a few thousand per day is more than 1% of the coin mining rewards, so the breakeven point would be daily mining rewards of about $1000. I guess all the coins that are microcap it would be cheaper to use VBK, but for any real project it would be much much less expensive to use dPoW. However, the 1% VBK cost can easily go up, in fact would have to for the smaller chains as that chains coins wont be enough to pay for the BTC tx.

If there are 10 different VBK chains, will there be 10 different BTC tx? If so, that isnt scalable. 1 BTC tx and the entire KMD ecosystem is secured

[27-Mar-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
also what prevents some rando using nicehash to mess with a chains VBK notarizations? having it totally decentralized might not be such the advantage if it allows nicehash notarization attacks. I am glad that after all these years, finally, there is another dPoW type of project.

[27-Mar-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if VBK will saturate the BTC blockchain with all the notarizations for coins that cant afford to pay a few thousand a year, then it will take a load off of us to secure just the larger chains. So these smaller chains will end up paying 10x more in their own coin that for dPoW and to miners... who tend to sell, which would cause downward pressure, maybe not so much if it is only 1% of blockreward, but what if it ends up at 10%+ of blockreward

[27-Mar-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
Anyway, if VBK does really well, that puts a rough valuation on the dPoW aspect of komodo, even if it is assumed they are of equivalent value. so this will be interesting to see

{Reactions}
💯 (2) 

[27-Mar-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe VBK becomes like the "minor leagues" for dPoW, so projects that cant afford $3000 to pay for dPoW can start with VBK and if they grow and want to stop paying a percentage of all block rewards (does VBK really notarize every block for every chain to BTC multiple times??) then they can upgrade to dPoW and cost contain their notarization

[27-Mar-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
can someone find out more details about VBK notarization for a small chain? if N BTC tx are generated each block, that has to be paid by somebody, and that somebody seems to be the chain that is being notarized. How paying for N BTC tx per block can possible compare to 1/10th the blocks in KMD, I have no idea. and we have had projects that couldnt afford to pay the KMD txfees!

[27-Mar-19 07:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It grinds my gears that one of the major complaints against KMD was the fabrication that somehow we had special mining rights over a 3rd party chain,  when Veriblock literally does have special mining rights on a 3rd party chain.

[27-Mar-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
how can a total fabrication be a major complaint?

[27-Mar-19 07:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Complaint from those who didn’t know better and just believed what they heard on twitter

[27-Mar-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that the market for dPoW is the first few pages of CMC. dPoW primary purpose is to secure the KMD ecosystem. If that is all it does, it is fine. The twitterati are not the customers

[27-Mar-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
Adding more coins is a service we provide, basically at our cost to other projects, so if they want to take advantage of it, then we are happy to help. if not, it is ok too.

[27-Mar-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
We have by far the most efficient notarization service immune to nicehash notarizations as only elected notaries can make a proposed notarization as a group. Cost per notarization is 1 KMD txfee every 10 blocks vs. N BTC txfee every block. Maybe I am wrong about the N BTC txfee per block per chain, but based on the number of VBK BTC tx during testnet (for one coin?), it could certainly be the correct math

[27-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so dozens of BTC txfee per block paid for by share of coins mining reward... the economics dont seem to be too good for these chains

[27-Mar-19 11:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
sorry just saw these replies

[27-Mar-19 11:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
regardless of the number of chains secured by VBK, the amt of BTC txns remains constant

[27-Mar-19 11:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
*constant meaning always changing based on btc fees/value of vbk I mean

[27-Mar-19 11:35 AM] crunchycat#0726
and I seriously doubt they'll only be securing small little shitcoins, being as how Bittrex is backing them as well as some of the largest VCs in crypto

[27-Mar-19 11:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
Even RVN was/is considering them based on tweets from their team

[27-Mar-19 11:38 AM] crunchycat#0726
And I agree, your use of BTC UTXO is "more efficient", but I wouldn't call it more secure

[27-Mar-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
what defense do they have from a nicehash notarization attack?

[27-Mar-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
is every block notarized by VBK? it seems a 10x to 100x more BTC txfees will become quite expensive and projects tend to want to spend as little as possible

[27-Mar-19 12:03 PM] crunchycat#0726
altcoins will have a fixed "cost" in whatever % block reward they choose, regardless of the number of btc notarization txns

[27-Mar-19 12:04 PM] crunchycat#0726
as for a "nicehash notarization attack" I'm not aware of how you'd accomplish this technically.  I'd suggest asking the actual team about this though, as I'm certain there are mitigations against  it

[27-Mar-19 12:05 PM] crunchycat#0726
I'm also not sure of the details on whether every altcoin block is notarized to vbk, or if this is adjustable via code or purely driven by the economics of notarization of the altcoin

[27-Mar-19 12:06 PM] crunchycat#0726
All great questions I'm hearing in here.  Wish I could answer more of them but alas, not an actual member of the VBK team so can only do my best

[27-Mar-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem with allowing anybody to notarize is that anybody can notarize, including attackers. with dPoW there are theoretical scenarios including the majority of notaries being controlled which can create messy situations. no lost funds, that we know of, but still some not so good chainstates. Since our notaries are by and large publicly known/accessible and have reputation to lose, this would be a one time thing and they are identified. With VBK, I would assume all such notaries gone bad scenarios also apply but with it being fully decentralized, there is no way to stop it from happening, over and over

[27-Mar-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so while they are presenting the decentralization of notaries as an advantage, it could easily be presented as a disadvantage

[27-Mar-19 12:18 PM] crunchycat#0726
