oh wow ! Thanks Poly, I need to do some arrangements!

[11-Jul-19 10:26 AM] MR_President#6999
will be only a dex exchange to use in a mobile. Will not be  to use in a window pc?

[11-Jul-19 10:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@MR_President i have mine.

atomicDEX is only the mobile GUI. They have a desktop one in the works too but that is not the priority.

We are trying to get hyperDEX ported over as well.

[11-Jul-19 11:00 AM] MR_President#6999

What realy in 2 weeks? üò≤ then there will be a public test?

[11-Jul-19 11:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes will probably take place on CHIPS discord, alpha testers then beta.

[11-Jul-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We still need to work on packaging everything up but we will find a way to allow people to test ASAP

[11-Jul-19 11:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is 2 other test coins on there plus other coins

[11-Jul-19 11:51 AM] Markus#5464
@hyperDEX will ppl use own coins for testing or get small amount to play around with?

There are 2 test coins but there will be a few coins that are very cheap

[11-Jul-19 11:53 AM] Markus#5464

in the lights of these giveaways; somebody with a decent twitter following that wants to gain more traction? Could be an idea to chip in with a group that that person could do a giveaway of e.g. 250 KMD / 1000 ARRR / ....

Nice progress done by kmd team

[11-Jul-19 05:03 PM] bogybogy#3962
the way ETH is designed - a higher ETH price makes no sense for users when it comes to economics and competition.  There is a big discrepance between user needs and speculator interests. Or am i wrong?

[11-Jul-19 05:04 PM] bogybogy#3962
This is the way I see it: The largest network wins. That network will swallow users from other competing platforms because users by default (human nature?) migrate towards the most popular platform. This doesn't swallow all the value from others just the majority.

[11-Jul-19 05:04 PM] bogybogy#3962
Therefore the largest most popular money networks maintain the most users and therefore power and influence. Today this is still the US dollar. This is quickly changing however.

[11-Jul-19 05:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
as crypto usage grows, and more money flows in, the most effecient and secure protocols will gain the most value. because time IS money. And attacks will become more serious and pervasive. small projects witn low hashrates and little security will be attacked mercilessly. popularity is important for getting eyes on the project now, and bringing investors in. but this whole show is just getting started.                  we're still in act 1. act 2 will likely bring more serious govt attempts to control this phenomenon. steering clear of their purview and jurisdictions seems like a smartest way to proceed right now, as opposed to spending millions of dollars and months/years on compliance.

[11-Jul-19 05:43 PM] bogybogy#3962
Bitcoins dominance in the market will not change if the rules of the game aren't changed. It is my personal belief that there is a chance that central governments will begin heavily monitoring the Bitcoin network making it unpleasant to use by your average Joe. Remember that Bitcoin is only pseudo anonymous and if they can tie you to a public address somehow they will. If laws around crypto currency aren't significantly changed for the better and you haven't paid capital gains in certain nation's like the U.S. they will make life very difficult for you. At this point Bitcoin will lose a portion of one of its most important properties. Censorship resistance. No central power or authority seeks to limit it's own power. It only seeks to ever increase it. This is the collective human nature that manifests itself in central governing bodies. This all stems from greed and there is nothing that will stop that. With all of that said. If we are talking network effects and what I believe will win long term as true hard money it has to be a privacy coin. Specifically a privacy coin whose network can scale very well.

At the moment my knowledge is limited to use privacy ,I hold but I don't use

[11-Jul-19 06:28 PM] PTYX#6840
It's difficult to attain privacy when you have to move from crypto to fiat and vice versa

[11-Jul-19 06:28 PM] crumb#2550
moving closer to getting paid in crypto helps

[11-Jul-19 06:28 PM] PTYX#6840
Probably worst privacy than banks since exchanges are more easily hacked.

[11-Jul-19 06:29 PM] crumb#2550
it is going to be slow and painful for most people. especially those who are less tech-savvy

[11-Jul-19 06:29 PM] PTYX#6840
You essentially trust your kyc info to a non financial entity when you switch from crypto to fiat

[11-Jul-19 06:30 PM] crumb#2550
kyc is a big joke

Yes it's going to take time for people to catch on. It seems cryptoonly (stable currencies and btc) processing and payments are coming though in certain countries.

I hate to use Venezuela as an example but from what I've heard, most people are using crypto

most is questionable. a lot probably more appropriate

[11-Jul-19 06:41 PM] PTYX#6840
@polycryptoblog sure you could purchase gold otc and sell it but you've now lost 10% or more in the exchange

[11-Jul-19 06:42 PM] PTYX#6840
And realistically you could only use such a scheme for daily expenses. Not for substantial amounts. It would be impractical.

@polycryptoblog even that is tough, you go to a coin/gold shop and there is paperwork for more than $600 I think.  Craigslist you deal with people, eBay has all transactions, and not too many people just take gold/silver for payment

[11-Jul-19 07:04 PM] cryptoclueless#9519
a few weeks ago palladium was the same price as gold, I thought about seeing if a coin shop would trade 1 for 1.   Then if/when palladium more valuable than gold, trade back for more gold and avoid the whole sale to fiat.

[11-Jul-19 07:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The coins I listed above are exempt from 1099B reporting.     You have to find a buyer but not too hard for that as you can undercut dealers by just offering spot price.  ( Most dealers charge 2-3% above spot ) .     Probably not the best for tx , greater than 100k,  but below shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.  Can fit a 20 coin tune in your pocket
