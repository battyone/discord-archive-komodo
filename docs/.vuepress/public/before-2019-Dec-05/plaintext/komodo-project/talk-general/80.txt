heared about FLO devs are discussing with us about 51% solution,how is this going on?

[29-Sep-18 07:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
@hyperDEX yes, your efforts should be profitable and Komodo benefits regardless
wasn't trying to say there shouldn't be a profit model
a good part of the anticipated profits from the fees would need to be reflected in the sale price (in the M&A case) anyway 😃

A quick analogy of why pirates came into existence should give a good overview of the correct trajectory for the coin. It appears to meet  hand in hook with the reason btc became accepted (at first) ... there is an underlying principle here that will be realised given time

Hello newbie here..
Can someone explain me how come "Independent blockchain on Komodo does not share infrastructure"?

[29-Sep-18 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@DesignBlock Independent blockchains (aka "assetchains") are fully independent in essentially the same manner as any two different chains are.
In the super-shortest explanation: 
The only "link" that happens is with dPoW, and that's where a notary creates a transaction on the chain and that transaction carries data (which is interpreted and used in the same manner as conventional "checkpoints")

[29-Sep-18 09:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Other than notary transactions, each chain is ran and moved along by the community around it (which may or may not involve the Komodo community at large)

[29-Sep-18 10:11 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Quite same as EOS BPs? Can someone create its own Komodo Platform n interoperate with old Komodo?

[29-Sep-18 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
No, nothing like EOS. Anyone can produce a block on an assetchain; in fact, several assetchains are to where each user can create their own block for their own transaction (block-on-demand)

[29-Sep-18 11:22 AM] DesignBlock#0184
All assetchains are run by 60 notary nodes, right?

[29-Sep-18 11:24 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So there is no option to run a token/dapp just under an assetchain / Komodo platform.. having own assetchain is mandatory?

[29-Sep-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, assetchains are run by whomever creates them and the community they reside in (notary nodes are purely optional added security)

[29-Sep-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use any chain you want

[29-Sep-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries just notarized

[29-Sep-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
much much much much less powers than BP nodes that are generating all blocks

[29-Sep-18 11:25 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 how? Having own miners?

[29-Sep-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
for assetchains,it could be that notaries dont generate any blocks at all

[29-Sep-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be a 100% PoS chain

[29-Sep-18 11:27 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So Komodo is POW or POS? are assetchains POS?

[29-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
please read a bit more, there is no simple one word answer

[29-Sep-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@DesignBlock If you create an assetchain, how it's mined is up to you (there are many options) you can use miners, as jl suggested PoS, or even let each user create a block on demand by using thier wallet

[29-Sep-18 11:30 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Wow, how about Komodo itself? How it is maintained? Or Komodo is not a blockchain? But a protocol?

[29-Sep-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is a blockchain

The cuccency? How about the Platform?

[29-Sep-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by "the Platform"

[29-Sep-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you seem to want one dimensional words when it is unclear if 3 dimensions are even enough

for KMD to do what it does, it cant be explained in an "elevator pitch"

[29-Sep-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has so much power that without any code changes the community can create and launch the third highest hashrate equihash coin

[29-Sep-18 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Like ogres and onions, it has many layers

[29-Sep-18 11:36 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So there is no such thing as "Mainchain" in Komodo, it works for the whole yet each is independent, right?

[29-Sep-18 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Correct, each chain is a completely separate, entirely independent, full blockchain

[29-Sep-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
there are many mainchains

[29-Sep-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
we often use the mainchain of one coin as the testnet

[29-Sep-18 11:38 AM] DesignBlock#0184
Who decides Komodo's development? Is there onchain governance? Like voting?

[29-Sep-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
people see something that needs to be fixed or implemented and when it works its pull request is accepted

[29-Sep-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
a pure meritocracy

[29-Sep-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I believe that buggy code is bad even if it is submitted in a pull request by a person of color

[29-Sep-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
or a person of any color

[29-Sep-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
code that works, it is accepted, regardless of the submitter.

[29-Sep-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or a translucent person

[29-Sep-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810

[29-Sep-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
cool. I was on the fence about that, it was not what we usually do

[29-Sep-18 03:37 PM] Seko#7408
Why do the big cryptosites ignore Komodo? What is the reason? Coindesk, Cointelegraph and in Germany BTC-Echo? Currently they speak of decentralized exchanges and list many, but don’t mention BarterDEX.  No matter what it's about, whether scaling, DEX, TPS, etc., they ignore all Komodo.

[29-Sep-18 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont pay for placement

[29-Sep-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and 99% of crypto "journalism" is actually paid placements, ie. advertising

[29-Sep-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810

coindesk for me is a joke!! :trollface:

[29-Sep-18 03:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
journalism is dependent in general  not only in crypto

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is so much ICO funds chasing limited crypto "news" inventory

[29-Sep-18 03:44 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
actually today a good social media could create platforms so that independent people could create journals... even steemit if tuned up could serve as such thing

[29-Sep-18 03:45 PM] Seko#7408
We need a independent and decentralized crypto journalism...;)

[29-Sep-18 03:46 PM] Yassin#3685
we need poker and casino run with komodo!! :yassinkomodo:

[29-Sep-18 03:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the biggest "mistake" is journalism is tuning up to biggest crowds (to make more money) to feed their needs. In crypto 99% population does not have a need to deeply understand tech implications, but to know how many tokens exist and where to "invest", so these "journals" are doing that for money

[29-Sep-18 03:47 PM] Yassin#3685
and chips 😃

[29-Sep-18 03:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
true educational journalism would be "we do not want to tune to anybody, just we share truth and aducation, if you search for it, there you have it"

[29-Sep-18 03:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and this leads to progress

[29-Sep-18 03:47 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
evolution

[29-Sep-18 03:48 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
current journalism is more selling/marketing and leads to bubble creation

[29-Sep-18 03:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
difference is basically the same as short and long vision for value ... shorts create more fluctuations

[29-Sep-18 03:50 PM] crumb#2550
Utrum (OOT) is striving to be crypto education/news/investing advice platform. they are using Komodo infrastructure to do it (token is secured by dPOW)

🆒 👍 

[29-Sep-18 03:50 PM] Seko#7408
So they're like paid influencers.

[29-Sep-18 03:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@crumb good, but this way OOT is aiming at needs of less then 1% of society, do not expect it to be popular and valued by masses = gain a lot of marketcap value

[29-Sep-18 03:52 PM] Seko#7408
@crumb yes, I know. Few month ago were the crypto sites my daily reading. But this time is over...

[29-Sep-18 03:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but I hope they will chance sth, there are always some chances to lead a change

[29-Sep-18 03:53 PM] crumb#2550
yeah, sure i know it's a niche thing. but still they are striving to do the right thing

[29-Sep-18 03:54 PM] crumb#2550
in time the amount of people interested in this tech will increase

[29-Sep-18 03:54 PM] crumb#2550
of course it'll take years

[29-Sep-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Deleted User  it will also be decentralized governance? decentralization not always means sth will be good... if most people will like to earn money it will be like journals - dencetralized as they got many shareholders wanting to make money

[29-Sep-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
to keep the vision it must be centralized around the vision and to enforce it you need to have a leader who is leading it - so it must be centralized

[29-Sep-18 04:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
like Elon Musk leading Tesla

[29-Sep-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or Jobs Apple

[29-Sep-18 04:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Some way the platform should allow to have many centers - leaders, so if you dont liek one, you take the other group

[29-Sep-18 04:04 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm thinking if there could be a platform that could enforce some good behaviors by design

[29-Sep-18 04:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and to my mind it must reflect properties and processes we already have in real life, like ID (trust system), voting and publishing information

[29-Sep-18 04:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also I like spam protection steemit like (every transaction is paid)

So ... some kind of checkpoints or markers are stored in BTC blockchain that give safe Restart points if the KMD network gets attacked ? Is this correction summation of the method used ?

[29-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487

It claims to be privacy currency and there is a talk of smart contracts as well

[29-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
