@Hungry_BullBear I'd suggest you research how P2P networks work before calling me dumb.... you speed insn't always limited by *your* internet connection, you're limited by the upload connection limits of the people you are connected *to*

[30-Sep-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you could have end to end fiber and if you're connected to someone 1/2way around the world using dial-up, then that's all the speed you're getting

[30-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
@Hungry_BullBear was it slow before you clicked that?

[30-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
did removing maxconnections=1 help?

[30-Sep-18 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sync is fine on linux with the 8 connections. I cna confirm it should only take 2-4H on a good connection just left to do its thing. Although if you connect= to a known very fast node it is slightly faster.

[30-Sep-18 12:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Hungry_BullBear  why not use Agama light version? no syncing needed

[30-Sep-18 12:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
SPV

[30-Sep-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sync on Debian with 26 connections works good too :trollface:

[30-Sep-18 12:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Hungry_BullBear didn't read whole conv, but if you don't need to use z-features can go with SPV, no need to sync

[30-Sep-18 12:48 PM] snowdamn#2414
lol, someone said same 45 minutes ago

[30-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Hungry_BullBear#1487
well thanks for the info but I had already started it .

Hello!
How can i access the "cli" option from within Agama.. I look in settings and nothing.
Also when input komodod.exe it freezes in NOTARY_PUBKEY  why?

[30-Sep-18 07:50 PM] ideamachines#8156
hi guys, does anyone know why when I fire up the Agama wallet to DL the chain/sync, that it hangs near the end? Been sitting like this for a day. I've tried restarting the wallet as well..
it just says  "loading data, please wait"

[30-Sep-18 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
which operating system you are using?

[30-Sep-18 07:59 PM] SHossain#0007
it could probably be rescanning chain at the background.

to be honest with you i wanted to buy some alts and was looking not just in charts but the coins themselves

[30-Sep-18 10:33 PM] IP#9768
i was considering kmd, byteball, qtum and pchain

[30-Sep-18 10:36 PM] IP#9768
what language/vm does komodo use for smart contracts?

[30-Sep-18 10:38 PM] IP#9768
yep this is what strikes me

[30-Sep-18 10:38 PM] IP#9768
so turing complete smart contracts on C/C++ right now?

[30-Sep-18 10:42 PM] IP#9768
thank you i will read it. was thinking about qtum at first because it combined utxo+pos+evm which looked cool

[30-Sep-18 10:42 PM] IP#9768
but dpow and multichain from komodo looks even more cool

[30-Sep-18 10:43 PM] IP#9768
well yeah and epic p&d with nodes in space lol

[30-Sep-18 10:44 PM] IP#9768

Hey @webhallen I see that you accept Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash as a payment method. Have you considered adding new cryptocurrencies? If so I recommend that you take a look at @KomodoPlatform ,@SocialSendCoin ,@enjin or @EnigmaMPC
Twitter

[01-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Mr.Cryptodude#8986
Its one of the biggest game stores in sweden

[01-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Markus#5464
Webhallen is using bitpay last time i checked

[01-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Markus#5464
so they just use a 3rd party to take crypto payment but in reality they get fiat and the 3rd party get the crypto u paid

eos and eth are VERY different

it is easier to compare eth and kmd. eos is very different beast
