Anyway, they haven't mentioned some of the biggest advantages of Komodo like it's exceptional scalability and dPoW for low-hashrate coins protection.

[02-Nov-18 08:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the Mattereum project is indeed very interesting, and anything similar can be built on any smart contract platform. Komodo would be great of course

even conceding to BTC maximalists that 'money' is a winner-takes-all outcome (doubtful), there so many other blockchain use cases, like this one, that are definitley not a zero-sum/winner-takes-all...  Komodo can shine in this

[02-Nov-18 09:28 PM] dwx#9071
ARRR is a hilarious ticker, well done to whoever thought of that one 😂😂

[02-Nov-18 09:29 PM] dwx#9071
Does PirateChain not have its own Discord?

[02-Nov-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Not own discord, but own sub-categories #deleted-channel

[02-Nov-18 10:02 PM] dwx#9071
Ah thank you, so piratechain is affiliated with Komodo rather than just a fork of its chain?

[02-Nov-18 10:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dwx It's an assetchain, not a fork (https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729160/What+is+a+Parallel+Chain+Asset+Chain)

How do i save my Wallet ? for the ARRR Pirate Chain ?

[02-Nov-18 10:33 PM] KaizySozy#0248
i dont see just a simple Save Wallet

[02-Nov-18 11:00 PM] Jonathan#3687
@KaizySozy All the necessary files are created on your local machine after the initial wallet sync. For Pirate the files are located in appdata/Roaming/Komodo/Pirate

[02-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Jonathan#3687
There's no need to save for any coin within the wallet

[02-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Jonathan#3687
Check here for the location of your wallet.dat file (it's suggested that you create a backup of it) https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024435-location-of-wallet-dat-file

[02-Nov-18 11:17 PM] Hermes#6934
You can save your wallet.dat in a cold storage if needed or in a folder that you prefer after you use the guide above 👆 .  If you want also you can save the private key of the specific address that holds your funds . Remember that the wallet.dat file contains your private keys but still you can copy a private key of a specific zaddress  as showed in tis guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024489-generate-a-new-address-and-export-private-keys-in-agama/en

[02-Nov-18 11:18 PM] Hermes#6934
You can save the wallet.dat in a cold storage each time you make an important transaction.

[02-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Hermes#6934
Also if you want to save the wallet.dat file make sure Agama is always shut down @KaizySozy

every month i hear of scamming and just the other day the dev leader of  oyster in which i invested SOME money, just decided to scam all, using ETHEREUM weakness minted and then dumped many tokens ruining many people and almost killing singlehanded one of the most interesting and original project in crypto world, komodo until now is the only group of dev and community-wise  that never lacks of honesty and trustness, thank you for existing komodo people wherever and whoever you are, you shine as a beacon in this black opaque terrible trappy and scammy crypto world.

dPoW, both have a "d" at the start, so it must be the same, must be the logic

China, through its Center for Information Industry Development has published its monthly ranking of cryptocurrencies publishing the latest rankings for October 2018.
Bitcoin falls into 19th position while Komodo remains in the top 10.
What do you think about this? Is it a fairer ranking than the coinmarketcap's?
