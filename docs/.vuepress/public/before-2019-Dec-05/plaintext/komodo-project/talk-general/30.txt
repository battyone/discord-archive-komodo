In Australia that sounds really dangerous.... My brother is a Roof Carpenter by trade... and most of the people he worked for didn't even have insurance for him, let alone some customer in 10 years time.

@blackjok3r they threaten?

@Cryptoon I understand, Europe is in despair?

Why would it be?

[17-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Consumers are very well protected over here

[17-Jul-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant get blood out of a stone, so if these dodgy guys are liable, likely no one is getting paid.

[17-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Houses are also a lot more expensive

[17-Jul-18 03:03 PM] AndronicusBass#7784
fact

[17-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I assume that's mostly because of the intrest bubble

We're definitely in a housing bubble. All the bailouts didnt even let the last bubble level out. This one will be worse.

Hence why I got a cheap house... the prices here cant fall as far. üòÑ

[17-Jul-18 03:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in percent yes... but in amount of money... its negligible

[17-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I bought an appartment in 2015, I can sell it now for 20% more than what I paid

[17-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Markets are crazy, it's very tempting to sell now, rent for a while and buy something else later

[17-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
With raising intrest rates the housing market should cool down

[17-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*should*

ive been out of touch for a while. anyone know whats the latest with EQL?

[17-Jul-18 11:12 PM] bishop#9773
Any idea why the Blocnation refunds are not totalling what was original sent?

[17-Jul-18 11:23 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
It‚Äôs based on what you bought with and the price of KMD at that time. So if you bought when KMD was close to $4 and used 200 KMD you‚Äôd only get back that 200 KMD not the $ equivalent

[17-Jul-18 11:27 PM] bishop#9773
Correct and I am basing it on the KMD deposit

[17-Jul-18 11:27 PM] bishop#9773
200 deposit, 187.xx back

[17-Jul-18 11:28 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
I asked because I had 1 wallet address that was short (seemed it was to me) and I‚Äôll post the response I got.

[17-Jul-18 11:28 PM] bishop#9773
Thanks

[17-Jul-18 11:29 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
@bishop  this is what they sent.

This is the response I'm getting from the team;

Likely they didn't buy during the highest bonus, so they get back a little less
It is possible people that bought during the biggest bonus get back a bit more
It is 14 cents vs 15 cents, a small different
Important thing is 100% of funds raised by bloc was returned
Prorated based on the number of BNTN sold
That is fair and so that is what was done
It cannot be helped that market prices went down

[17-Jul-18 11:30 PM] bishop#9773
I bought the first day or two

[17-Jul-18 11:31 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
Then I have no idea. That 2nd wallet I used $500 to buy for a friend. After totaling it up it came out to around $398 so to me it is short 102. But I don‚Äôt know about the prorated stuff or bonuses. My first address was right but the 2nd seemed short. No idea

[17-Jul-18 11:31 PM] bishop#9773
I would think that window should be the highest bonus but I cannot recall

[17-Jul-18 11:32 PM] bishop#9773
then again, I had to wait like 9 days to get my coins and even then, they didn't total to what they should have when I was quoted on their site. Made the mistake of using their shitty web service

[17-Jul-18 11:32 PM] bishop#9773
frankly, I'm just glad I got back the majority as the whole thing just fell apart.

[17-Jul-18 11:33 PM] bishop#9773
OOT experience was on point though

[17-Jul-18 11:34 PM] grim_chiefer#6001
I hate it because it could‚Äôve been such a great project but way too many hiccups along the way. I know the pain of that web service as my funds were stuck a long time too but it was eventually resolved.

Glad they decided to refund before moving forward and restructuring.

Yes, OOT has been full speed ahead it seems

hi I missed the July 13 swap. is it anyway possible to have another chance to do the swap?

[18-Jul-18 02:52 AM] bishop#9773
what swap?

[18-Jul-18 03:40 AM] grim_chiefer#6001
No problem @c2k Yeah it sucks but they did the right thing and I respect them for it. Not all ppl get their investments back in ICOs. Even though it had its issues, I have a lot of respect for that team for the way they handled it in the end. Their admins were also always available and I appreciated the help I got from them.
