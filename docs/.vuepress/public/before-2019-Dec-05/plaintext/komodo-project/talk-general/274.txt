I prefer simple functioning solutions to problem.s

[19-Apr-19 12:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
not with that attitude it isn't

[19-Apr-19 12:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
i prefer simple solutions over unnecessary over-complications of things

[19-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
I prefer things that are working and allow others to make improvements and variations of it

"LINK tokens are used to pay data providers, ChainLink node operators, payment providers, and other online service providers for their services. Smart contract users will compensate the data providers that they use with LINK tokens."

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How's this working out.  Curious.

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
we are not

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
if you quantify quality in more lines of code you don't really understand efficiency

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
dont worry komodo wont obsolete the LINK

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
LOL True.  KMD will probably benefit link in the future.

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe the hundreds of trustless oracles chains made by others will put a dent

[19-Apr-19 12:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dane won't even know it.

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Bye bird.

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"As LINK tokens are used as a currency on the ChainLink platform, the more usage the ChainLink platform has, the more valuable LINK tokens should be."

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] mrlynch#5735
and you expect ppl to take you seriously?! bye

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Nice promises from an ICO.

[19-Apr-19 12:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[19-Apr-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so blockchains are redundant, we should get rid of them?

if you have to trust some other node, it is a trusted network but it can be very efficient
if you want  a trustless network, it has to be less efficient, that removes the trust

if you can understand about timestamps in blocks, you are understanding most of the trustless oracles

it takes advantage of the identical mechanism, i just piggybacked oracledata onto it

Do you guys have dank memes

[19-Apr-19 12:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You know what I find funny... is the number of people who come INTO Komodo to talk shit is completely and inversely porportional to the number of Komodo people who go into other discords to talk shit.

@Timo - James will be glad to have sdiscussions on these topics anytime/

[19-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ok. eager to hear how you will corrupt the timestamp an hour ahead

[19-Apr-19 12:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085

I work for two ecostystem projects.

[19-Apr-19 12:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We're building tech that does not exist in the market.

[19-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Lamp#5829
Sure, but Smart Contract is (whom you're implying are here argueing instead of building)

[19-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say nontech community members do the tech, i said that devs are part of the community

Smart Contracts - Fine.   Trolls... not neccesary.

[19-Apr-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if there are any potential flaws.

[19-Apr-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but so far, it seems the flaws are not in the trustless oracle

[19-Apr-19 12:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They must have missed the three day conversation with Zack, the founder of Veo, and dev for Aeternity/Augur.

[19-Apr-19 12:56 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But hey, who cares about roots right?

[19-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and with enough work, maybe a complex reward, punishment, reputation system can solve all the practical issues, but i get stuck on the offchain betting which brings in magnitudes more funds for the attacker than entire chain value. how can you fight that? even with BTC it cant win against sustained 51% hashrate

[19-Apr-19 12:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
`Why are guys wasting time talking to us instead of coding?` some say we code in our sleep.. or do we sleep?!

Went to be at 2 AM the night before.  It's been about 8 hours of sleep over 2 days for this pirate.
