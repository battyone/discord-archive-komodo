how can any business profit from using blockchain?

[07-Jul-19 04:20 PM] PTYX#6840
that's a very broad question. you would need to look at the type of business and its processes. then you have to decide what it is you want to improve.

[07-Jul-19 04:20 PM] Karlo#3588
Dont get me wrong, I'm just preparing my research to invest heavy money in this project, especially looking at the upcoming rebranding and some marketing engines coming in

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] Karlo#3588
It's better to ask questions directly in the source of all informations : here

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] PTYX#6840
blockchain isn't good for everything, but it's really good for certain things like operating in low-trust environments.

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] Karlo#3588
Ofc, but how Komodo seperates from the rest?

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] PTYX#6840
So for example, let's take a real estate business

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] Karlo#3588
There is like 3000 blockchain projects, why would someone choose komodo over then?

[07-Jul-19 04:21 PM] Karlo#3588
them*

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] PTYX#6840
but now the question changes from how can businesses "profit" from blockchain to how is komodo different.

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] PTYX#6840
it's hard to put in a few words of why it's different.

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Karlo#3588
I like to keep things simple

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Karlo#3588
if something doesnt have simple explanation its not worth my time and money

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] PTYX#6840
some would agree that the main benefits of komodo is the way the network is setup to be very independent.

[07-Jul-19 04:22 PM] Karlo#3588
okay, go on

[07-Jul-19 04:25 PM] PTYX#6840
i think that's one of the main points. because most other platforms offer tokens that depend on the mainchain to operate. if the mainchain stops, the tokens die. that's not the case with Komodo. Moreover, you have a total independence plus the added security of Bitcoin. When you start looking at it deeper though then it gets more complex because of all the features and tech Komodo has. Such as zk-snarks, Barterdex, cryptocondition contracts, and now nspv which is a new type of litenetwork.

Next question. Does anyone have any KMD logo wallpapers for phone?

[07-Jul-19 04:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Karlo from investment point of view, can also analyse the total supply, current cost per unit, potential of the gains as comparison to what Komodo offers so far and what it can offer in future, and taking that in note how much it can gain of the market share, and based on that, how much gain you can have. If you really analyse that, to my opinion, there's a lot more potential to grow with Komodo than other platforms who offer similar solutions, like Cosmos and Polkadot (ETH 2.0)

[07-Jul-19 04:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
From technical development point of view, that tokenomics article must clear what is it that gives value to KMD in the ecosystem development, and how it has chance to grow bigger

we are currently stress testing a single nSPV full node with 850 superlite clients bombarding it at fullspeed. so far it seems to be holding up pretty well, so we get almost a 1000x capacity of nSPV clients, which means the existing ~1000 fullnodes would be able to support a million nSPV clients. I got most all the validation working, so the proper data is indeed going from the fullnode to the superlite client and allowing it to validate the segment of blockchain using dPoW. it literally takes 2 seconds to startup, login and spend funds, even on KMD chain. that is even for first use

Hi everyone, I have tried many times and followed instructions given by you kind folks here but not success yet, my seed is producing the wrong pub key so it must be wrong however... I have used this seed and successfully recovered the wallet multiple times in the past. Please could someone with good technical skill please help me out sometime next week? the help would be much appreciated, I only have 500 kmd in the wallet and happy to give 50-100 of them if a solution is found.

[07-Jul-19 11:30 PM] crumb#2550
did you check there are no extra spaces before and after your seed words?

[07-Jul-19 11:31 PM] crumb#2550
also did you try writing them out in Notepad or other ascii only text editor and copy-pasting from there

[07-Jul-19 11:34 PM] joejewson#7282
all tried yes, multiple times

[07-Jul-19 11:35 PM] crumb#2550
one set of seedwords == one specific address

[07-Jul-19 11:35 PM] crumb#2550
you must have different seed

[07-Jul-19 11:35 PM] crumb#2550
there are no other possibilities

[07-Jul-19 11:36 PM] crumb#2550
one mistyped or added/missing character and you have a different address

[07-Jul-19 11:36 PM] joejewson#7282
100% there is no fault that could be happening outside of my own error?

[07-Jul-19 11:38 PM] crumb#2550
how many times did you use the same seed to access your funds before your recent unsuccessful tries

[07-Jul-19 11:38 PM] hastrup#8742
@joejewson do you have more then one seed you use? And do you use verus agama wallet?

[07-Jul-19 11:39 PM] joejewson#7282
only 1 seed, i am using verus as of today yes, before was using prior version of agama downloaded from official github or website

[07-Jul-19 11:40 PM] joejewson#7282
at least 3 or 4 times over the last 2-3 year crumb

[07-Jul-19 11:40 PM] joejewson#7282
then i updated to more recent version of agama and it created diff pub address

[07-Jul-19 11:40 PM] crumb#2550
did you try the copy-paste thing?

[07-Jul-19 11:40 PM] hastrup#8742
So when you made an new "account" whit verus agama you did not first use another seed?

[07-Jul-19 11:41 PM] joejewson#7282
did copy and paste yes

[07-Jul-19 11:41 PM] joejewson#7282
never used different seed on this wallet

[07-Jul-19 11:41 PM] crumb#2550
using a raw text editor not word or anything like that which has formatting

[07-Jul-19 11:42 PM] joejewson#7282
using notepad, typing it in, changing words that i may have got wrong, i have tried everything and never had an issue with it before

[07-Jul-19 11:43 PM] joejewson#7282
my original copy of seed a very clear, i am very positive i am not making a mistake which is why its so strange. I am no newbie to wallets but not a techy

[07-Jul-19 11:43 PM] hastrup#8742
Do you have a backup of your backup?

[07-Jul-19 11:44 PM] crumb#2550
did you also check if you had words which could have similar characters for example number 1 and lowercase l can be quite similar with some fonts

[07-Jul-19 11:45 PM] joejewson#7282
i have the wallet.dat file

[07-Jul-19 11:45 PM] crumb#2550
zero and O

[07-Jul-19 11:45 PM] hastrup#8742
Oh

[07-Jul-19 11:45 PM] joejewson#7282
yes crumb, did all that

[07-Jul-19 11:46 PM] joejewson#7282
ok will give that a go, i need to put the wallet.dat into the roaming folder correct?

Linux: ~/.komodo
macOS/OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo
Windows: %APPDATA%/Komodo

what OS are you using?

[07-Jul-19 11:47 PM] crumb#2550
windows?

[07-Jul-19 11:48 PM] hastrup#8742
And remember to have a backup of your backup and one backup that is not on whit the other backups and use veracrypt to encryp your usbs whit your backups

[07-Jul-19 11:48 PM] crumb#2550
copy wallet.dat file into %APPDATA%/Komodo 
and do rescan
