[27-Oct-18 07:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which version of agama are you using, update to latest will be the first question and recommendation the support guys will recommend. After that it’s case specific

[27-Oct-18 08:06 AM] nath#8776

[27-Oct-18 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Hey token lovers! We support tokens on #Ethereum, however it's never enough. Now question: tokens on which platform should we support first? @KomodoPlatform @wavesplatform @EOS_io @tezos
Twitter

[27-Oct-18 12:06 PM] BlockTech#6895
But at least we spread a little bit of awarness :)

[27-Oct-18 01:44 PM] PTYX#6840
We are trying to negotiate the addition of KICs to Guarda. I was told that they would look into it in November. I'm guessing that's what the poll was for. Even though XTZ won the poll, they don't have tokenization yet so Komodo is the choice that makes the most sense. Fingers crossed.

@crumb @KomodoWorld 
Hi, You've probably seen by now that there is someone scamming PIRATE using a fake discord and populating it with people from here. (It was being talked about in #deleted-channel).  It might be that your name being used isn't a coincidence.

[29-Oct-18 11:26 AM] crumb#2550
could we ban the fake Crumb? i brought up the fake crumb issue on the 26th of october and since then the fake account has not replied, changed name or posted anything

[29-Oct-18 11:27 AM] crumb#2550
@SHossain you have the rights to ban users here?

who is the impersonator?

@SHossain  maybe also this can be  BOTized if there is any pattern in behaviour - name regex or icons used simmilar to other users - get some bot detect it quickly and notify admin ?

Theres so much talk about arrr or whatever that pirate token is, why is it relevant to kmd? Do we get airdrop as a kmd holder?

[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Nabob#5004
Pirate is a privacy coin, Privacy/Shielded/z tx only chain (No transparent transactions possible on PIRATE chain). there is no airdrop,  you can now mine or buy on #deleted-channel 
more info come over to #pirate @cammofunk

[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a very popular coin in the ecosystem

[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what is good for the ecosystem is good for KMD due to the wholistic ecosystem interconnectedness

@house Are you saying pirate runs on kmd platform?

[30-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
komodod is used to launch a runtime fork, called PIRATE

[30-Oct-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is notarized to dPoW
