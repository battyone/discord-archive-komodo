alright, my bad then

[11-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Tesla Nguyen#1873
Select Komodo, Hardware Wallet, and Enter Password. The password will encrypt a backup that will allow you to login the wallet as a watch-only address. You can only spend funds if your Ledger device is connected and you approve the transaction.

is this how you actually create a hw wallet on magnum?

I was waiting until this post to state that the $KMD team has been fantastic and all of my funds have been returned.  OPSEC and all.   

Can‚Äôt thank them enough!  

This was their DAO moment and they handled it WAY better than $ETH did.

I had an old agama wallet, I‚Äôm a pretty old user from@bitcoin dark days; haven‚Äôt actually logged on yet to see if my coins were moved but heard some news about old users coins being moved around?

[11-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Kittehcoinyo#4247
Will check tonight

[11-Jun-19 06:03 PM] ETcrypt#3306
@jl777c I would filled out the form received the smartdust in old agama on the 7th, sent it to new agama on the 9th, haven't received my tokens as yet. How can i find out if there is any issues with my claim or if anything else is required from my end

[11-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Kittehcoinyo if you havent entered your seed in any agama the past 4 months you are probably fine

[11-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ETcrypt might be an amount over 17777 kmd, or disputed claim. (Amounts dont match, several claims, ...) best to wait for the team to get in touch

[11-Jun-19 06:07 PM] ETcrypt#3306
Thanks, I wish I had so many KMD

[11-Jun-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
contact support if you havent gotten a refund and you have done all the steps

[11-Jun-19 06:08 PM] ETcrypt#3306
support off the KMD website?

[11-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Janette#4272
Hey guys. Sorry, but I want to understand the refund again. I have now registered my new wallet. Then I will get to my old wallet a special amount X. I send it to my new wallet and so I am authorized. Is that roughly correct? But the bad guys knows the old wallet and the seed. How can it be prevented that they simply carries out the procedure in my name?

[11-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to ask in #support @ETcrypt

[11-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Janette the bad guys will not know what new address you entered in your claim form

[11-Jun-19 06:11 PM] smalls#0439
I have not received a refund, have been out of town for the last few days, but filed a claim before I left

[11-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and if the bad guys entered another address, then the claim is disputed, because 2 persons claiming and you will be contacted by support to provide further details

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Kittehcoinyo#4247
I have entered it in last 4 months; last 2 weeks

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@smalls have your sent the dust that got sent to you on the old address to the new address?

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] smalls#0439
No, I haven't received any email or instructions

[11-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Kittehcoinyo then there might be a chance your account was swept if you used agama 0.3.5 or later.

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] smalls#0439
I could see my funds went to the safe address

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@smalls check explorer for your old address and see if you got sent a small tx; you arent supposed to get an email.

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(as we dont know your email)

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] smalls#0439
will do.. I gave my email when filing the cclaim

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now that the vast majority of addresses have been claimed, i can reveal the three step process that will be used for processing refunds.
1. a special transaction will be send to your compromised address. it will be for a fraction of a KMD
2. you need to send 0.0001 (or more) from the compromised address to the destination address you specified
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made. PLEASE do not ask when these refund tx will be made, i am working as fast as i can, so it will happen when it happens.

what do you need to do?
if your claim amount matches the current batches size range check to see if you got the special transaction. Then make sure you only send it to the address you claimed. after that, just wait. i will announce status of each batch.

if you didnt get a special tx, that means your address is under dispute or you filed too many claims or it is the wrong size. PLEASE wait until we process all the problem free cases first. They will be done AFTER the easy cases are done. 

Please dont expect any refund payments until june 15, maybe i can get it done sooner, but step 3 is a LOT of custom code that cannot have any errors

[11-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Janette#4272
@Cryptoon but he could create a new one and do the process. He know the old wallet, he know the seed and he will say "hey iam the owner"

[11-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
read this @smalls

[11-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Janette that is why, if there are multiple people claiming

[11-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the team will investigate further

[11-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I cannot go into further details than that üòÉ

That wallet is fine yes

[11-Jun-19 06:15 PM] smalls#0439
thanks

[11-Jun-19 06:15 PM] Janette#4272
I get it :). But if somebody really comes in very late, could he get problems?

[11-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That remains to be seen üòÉ

[11-Jun-19 06:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The faster everyone claims his/hers funds the better

[11-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That is also why the team only started with the small amounts and left the bigger ones for later

[11-Jun-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sooner is much better than later

[11-Jun-19 06:30 PM] smalls#0439
Thanks for the help @Cryptoon , the small amount was there and I sent .0001 to the new address I used in my claim. Now I wait patiently.

[11-Jun-19 10:24 PM] markuk#2735
the amount is in red and no reward show

[11-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Nev#5914
Do you have more than 10 coins in there, has it been more than one hour since you recieved coins, are the transactions split into small ones, less than 10? Ten is the magic number.

[11-Jun-19 10:28 PM] markuk#2735
55

[11-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Nev#5914
Are they in one block/tranaction?

[11-Jun-19 10:28 PM] markuk#2735
yes

[11-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Nev#5914
Do they have lock time checked?

[11-Jun-19 10:29 PM] markuk#2735
no

[11-Jun-19 10:30 PM] Nev#5914
That's why, they need to to sent to your self again, don't know why that happend but it worked for me.

[11-Jun-19 10:30 PM] markuk#2735

[11-Jun-19 10:31 PM] Nev#5914
And it stayed with lock unchecked?

[11-Jun-19 10:31 PM] markuk#2735
yes

I think I made a mistake I sent the smart dust coins from my compromised wallet directly into my new Verus agama wallet is that going to put at risk my newly created wallet

[11-Jun-19 10:34 PM] markuk#2735
now it gone green

[11-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Nev#5914
Green for go, it will likly start rewarding after an hour and you should see your rewards going up over time.

[11-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Nev#5914
That timelock has to be green.

[11-Jun-19 10:39 PM] markuk#2735
