Will the rebrand include a marketing push for the SuperNET asset as well?  Would be nice to get more liquidity for that, especially for the original investors who helped fund the project from the very beginning üòâ

[07-Apr-19 02:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[07-Apr-19 02:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Supernet asset is James project it is independent of komodo even though it has benefitted from the technology that it has developed.

[07-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
SuperNET gains in value when the underlying assets gain value. So when kmd rises, superNET should too üòÉ

@richardt i am looking for people to help with SUPERNET, I cant do everything myself and currently there is nobody else to help out. i am not sure how to market it in this market, maybe once DEX is generating good revshare that is a good time?

[07-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Are you still planning for supernet to deliver products or solely have it act as a fund?

[07-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
is KMD a product?

[07-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I certainly am not in a position to be doing end user products directly, since I dont do gui

[07-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Products/tech/... or mainly investing

[07-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
is KMD products/tech?

[07-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET invests in coins and then does what it can to help them

[07-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm KMD is almost more like an ecosystem, powered by the coin/tech provided by platform.

[07-Apr-19 11:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
Supernet has been around longer than almost everything else in the crypto space right now.  The fact it still exists at all is good marketing for the platform. I think revshare would do the rest on it's own. A simple website like the previous nav.php page would suffice for current holders imo.

how much supernet holds is on the blockchain

[07-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so not really private

[07-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how many supernet assets each individual holds is another thing :p

[07-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Also it's an asset tied to underlying assets value, so you kinda need to know the amount of underlying assets to calculate supernet value.

[07-Apr-19 02:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think what you privately "own" should be private. But when you are building business, trust is important. And backing your story with financial data that offers transparency is good for others to verify your history.

If I 51% attack bitcoin can I censor transactions?

[07-Apr-19 10:31 PM] Regnar#6164
if you control 51% of hashpower you decide what is in a block you mine, so they could be empty. But you would have to maintain 51% control forever to keep censoring. Their transactions are sitting in the mempool and if you aren't beating all the other miners to another block then they will mine them.

[07-Apr-19 11:11 PM] Regnar#6164
But that's very expensive and the resources to attack Bitcoin aren't really available (renting hashpower, or buying enough new miners). So people opt to gain 51% of smaller chains that are Nicehashable, they don't do this to censor transactions though, usually they do it to double spend deposits to an exchange

@zenzenzenzen2 Monero is an excellent coin with solid devs.  One of the best projects.

because it actually understands that mandatory privacy is required to have privacy/fungibility, which most projects dont

[08-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog my opinion on xmr : 
they try but fight battles they can't win. Forking the network every 6 months is beyond retarded. the only reason they do this is to protect their owm mining interests. They can't compete with ASICS. and xmr doesn't like competetion. XMR is highly centralized around developers. There is no funding so Certain parties with ( maybe not so nice ) interests will get to decide what develops.  (blockstream takeover).


XMR privacy is also really a joke compared to Zero proofs. XMR is just a mixer, and a very lousy one too. with only 11 mixins. Dash for example has a anonimity set of a few million.  

it not having public data too will not do adoption good either.

[08-Apr-19 02:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
XMR is one specific coin, just like ZEC. Just like KMD is closely related to ZEC but *very* different, there are many CryptoNote coins which share code with XMR but *very* different values and also add really cool tech. Also note that there are over twice as many Monero forks as Zcash forks last I counted, which says something about dev communities. Let's go beyond inter-coin drama and push the tech of the whole space forward

Also, some XMR fork coins are interested in adding DPoW, and that surely would be an amazing way to show the world that DPoW is compatible with coins which are not Bitcoin forks, a huge milestone!

[08-Apr-19 02:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm Glad we have another great project like XMR.   We definitely need more than one strong privacy protocols, because if we only have one (ARRR or XMR) and it fails to provide the needed privacy or security, then we have none.
