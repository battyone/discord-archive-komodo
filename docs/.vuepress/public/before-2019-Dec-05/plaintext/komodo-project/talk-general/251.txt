i felt similar with a lot of mobile and facebook games long ago and i stopped playing. i.e.: farmville

[03-Apr-19 05:08 PM] SHossain#0007
dumb it may sound, i played farmville for a long time. at the end i started using bots to do regular staffs. then, at a point it started taking hours with bots. and, i realised it was enough

[03-Apr-19 05:09 PM] SHossain#0007
but, of course i'll be playing any game is being made on Komodo Platform.

[03-Apr-19 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
first time i played Rogue here. never before.

Hi guys👋

[03-Apr-19 09:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hello

[04-Apr-19 01:16 AM] crunchycat#0726
yo, what's everybody's prediction for VBK prices when trading opens up Friday?

[04-Apr-19 01:17 AM] crunchycat#0726
ah I know, I can just feel the love emanating from this discord.  Couldn't resist

[04-Apr-19 01:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
So I'll discuss KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'm gonna put myself in a large corp. shoes, or a govt. entity

[04-Apr-19 01:18 AM] crunchycat#0726
what would be the selling point with how KMD secures a shitcoin to BTC for these orgs?

[04-Apr-19 01:19 AM] crunchycat#0726
Meaning, these entities dgaf about efficiency

[04-Apr-19 01:20 AM] crunchycat#0726
So if I was a govt/large corp, what would you tell me to convince me to secure my blockchain to BTC hashrate using KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:20 AM] crunchycat#0726
Instead of something else like...I don't know...VBK for example

[04-Apr-19 01:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
Legitimate question though

[04-Apr-19 01:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
maybe @dukeleto can answer

[04-Apr-19 01:21 AM] crunchycat#0726
he was down to answer yesterday

lol, okay then please take my Q without any implied perjorative

[04-Apr-19 01:23 AM] crunchycat#0726
I really am interested in the opinion here

[04-Apr-19 01:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I lost my horseshitenese/English translator, please rephrase

[04-Apr-19 01:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Apr-19 01:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
hmmm...that doesn't work

[04-Apr-19 01:26 AM] crunchycat#0726
imagine I have a blockchain that contains important information.  I want it secured to BTC to ensure maximum security

[04-Apr-19 01:28 AM] crunchycat#0726
Option 1)  Use KMD, which has elected notaries and secures my chain with a notarization every (insert # here) blocks.
Option 2) Use something else that secures my chain with 512 separate, independent notorizations every minute

[04-Apr-19 01:29 AM] crunchycat#0726
What am I missing here to sway me to KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:29 AM] crunchycat#0726
in due time dear sir

[04-Apr-19 01:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
dpow is real and your imagination isn't

[04-Apr-19 01:31 AM] Tort#9226
lol

[04-Apr-19 01:31 AM] crunchycat#0726
seriously though, I saw a post the other day of a notary? saying they wouldn't support others that bribe for votes

[04-Apr-19 01:31 AM] crunchycat#0726
....

[04-Apr-19 01:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
right

[04-Apr-19 01:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and if what you're eluding to is what I think it is, I'll break that as easily as I've borked everything else they pretended to do

[04-Apr-19 01:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
so, bribery for votes is a think for KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:32 AM] crunchycat#0726
sounds legit

[04-Apr-19 01:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
sound very secure

[04-Apr-19 01:33 AM] crunchycat#0726
?

[04-Apr-19 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@crunchycat when you're done trolling, ask jeff when he's going to remove my ban

[04-Apr-19 01:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I don't know what that means

[04-Apr-19 01:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, sure

[04-Apr-19 01:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
apparently I'm not

[04-Apr-19 01:34 AM] crunchycat#0726
when is jeff going to remove your ban?

[04-Apr-19 01:35 AM] crunchycat#0726
wtf does that mean?

[04-Apr-19 01:35 AM] crunchycat#0726
I asked a legitimate question on the merits of KMD vs other solutions

[04-Apr-19 01:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, not vbk

[04-Apr-19 01:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
who banned him?  I don't know a jeff

[04-Apr-19 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only coin I've ever broken

[04-Apr-19 01:36 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay this seems unrelated and I don't know what you're talking about

[04-Apr-19 01:37 AM] crunchycat#0726
yeah, shill me on KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:38 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay, so why are elections the answer here?  So the # of notarizations can be throttled?

[04-Apr-19 01:38 AM] crunchycat#0726
That's basically like limited the # of POW miners, making them get elected, and having a set # of POW miners secure a blockchain

[04-Apr-19 01:39 AM] crunchycat#0726
yes, I realize this

[04-Apr-19 01:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
okay I'm giving a comparison to POW.  I do this because the method of "other" coins is to let as many "notaries" do that function as makes sense economically

[04-Apr-19 01:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
gives better security

[04-Apr-19 01:40 AM] crunchycat#0726
and decentralization

[04-Apr-19 01:42 AM] crunchycat#0726
I get that

[04-Apr-19 01:42 AM] crunchycat#0726
so why not allow all the notaries as is economically possible, instead of throttling it

[04-Apr-19 01:43 AM] crunchycat#0726
are you for that concept?

[04-Apr-19 01:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so why not allow all the notaries as is economically possible, instead of throttling it`
because then there's no miners and I enjoy my job

[04-Apr-19 01:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
that's already been put in place

[04-Apr-19 01:44 AM] crunchycat#0726
that makes no sense, "other" coins are doing this now

[04-Apr-19 01:45 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'll certainly give KMD credit, they were the first

[04-Apr-19 01:46 AM] crunchycat#0726
but the voting in of notaries and that whole mechanism leaves a very bad taste in my mouth

[04-Apr-19 01:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but the voting in of notaries and that whole mechanism leaves a very bad taste in my mouth`
perhaps that's the taste of your emoji and not KMD

[04-Apr-19 01:47 AM] crunchycat#0726
oh nice, very technical comeback

[04-Apr-19 01:48 AM] crunchycat#0726
^^^for CG

[04-Apr-19 01:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
technically, your "taste" is irrelevant to decentralized stakeholder choices as opposed to other plans where people directly buy control (or get given it because they are friends with the devs)

[04-Apr-19 01:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
your basic premise is 'no consensus, let people buy their way in'

[04-Apr-19 01:49 AM] crunchycat#0726
what other plans are you speaking of?  And how are choices in KMD not bought?

[04-Apr-19 01:49 AM] crunchycat#0726
votes are bribed

[04-Apr-19 01:50 AM] crunchycat#0726
If you're speaking of VBK there are 512 independent pop txns every minutes on the VBK blockchain

[04-Apr-19 01:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`votes are bribed`
Do you really believe that someone used their 1 million votes to get a "kickback" of $20 worth of KMD? really?

[04-Apr-19 01:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
those with a large enough stake to "buy" a NN would earn more in rewards than the NN will earn all year

[04-Apr-19 01:52 AM] crunchycat#0726
I'm saying a high-level view of the entire concept of KMD shows very few notaries, relatively few notarizations.  This equals centralization, lack of security

[04-Apr-19 01:52 AM] crunchycat#0726
that's all

how

in our case

[04-Apr-19 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
less is obviously more :troll:

[04-Apr-19 01:53 AM] crunchycat#0726
wtf less is more?

[04-Apr-19 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can t speak about centralised solution because 64

[04-Apr-19 01:53 AM] crunchycat#0726
it's more efficient, I get that argument

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
in that case 512 is centralised

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
a finite number versus no limits is centralised

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@crunchycat when you actually want answers instead of just spitting buzzwords and refusing to actually read the words in response to your questions, feel free to ask again

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
kyc versus dex is centralised.

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] crunchycat#0726
but for maximum security, would you want 512/minute or 64/every 10 minutes or whatever?

[04-Apr-19 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
wake up

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
what if I told you you won t be more secure with 512 notarizer a minute ?

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
you ll just be as secure as kmd

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] crunchycat#0726
"it doesn't matter" is not a good reply

but poor

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`512/minute`
and 30k of them sit meaninglessly in the mempool being entirely useless

if you believe ntrz speed is key

[04-Apr-19 01:55 AM] crunchycat#0726
no, it's actually 512/minute clear on btc blocks

[04-Apr-19 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
I give you this proposal

[04-Apr-19 01:56 AM] crunchycat#0726
it's decentralized.  That's the whole point, as many can do it as is economically feasible
