scales to at least 64 per cluster gives about 25,000 tx/s no problem.

Even at very low scales we are smacking visa/mastercard

[10-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Alright#0419
there is a payment channels contract in development as well, but I think it's better suited to specific use cases than using it for everything

[10-Jan-19 06:26 AM] garbonzo607#4659
It has to be scalable and cheap though.

[10-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Alright#0419
creating artificial scarcity in block space is "cheap"?

[10-Jan-19 06:28 AM] Alright#0419
driving up tx fees for no good reason other than "centralization" boogey man

[10-Jan-19 06:28 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Payment channels should be cheaper than using blockchains which need to write to multiple places. Payment channels only write to multiple places if there's a dispute. In an optimal world, that shouldn't happen too often at all.

[10-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
We can make using the blockchain itself cheap, what's the benefit of payment channels?

[10-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
I can think of one, instant trustless confirmation

[10-Jan-19 06:31 AM] garbonzo607#4659
Like I said, I'm struggling with a basic math equation here, like 1+1. Blockchains need to write to multiple places in order to be trustless. That will never be cheaper than writing to one place. That's why blockchains can serve as the trustless dispute arbiter. What am I missing?

[10-Jan-19 06:31 AM] Alright#0419
this `That will never be cheaper than writing to one place.`

[10-Jan-19 06:32 AM] Alright#0419
with a fungible chain cluster, if there is a need to increase transactions per second, make another chain. Simple

[10-Jan-19 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why complicate things with something that can never work ... LN requires routing to be solved... which was NEVER even solved by the internet... Routing is a trusted system on the internet that uses a reactionary security model... if someone does something bad they need to be identified them removed from the system... Blockchain doesnt need that, it has consesnsus rules, you cant break them... No trust.

[10-Jan-19 06:37 AM] garbonzo607#4659
"My biggest problem with Lightning is that some middle man can say "we won't let you pay this corp". Surely the corp won't open payment channels with just anyone"

Lightning will enable an economic reason to migrate away from corporations in the first place. I look forward to an entirely peer to peer transactional world. Corporations / governments can try to regulate it, but it can't. People will use dApps because they will be cheaper than going through corps. If corps want to limit where you can send your money, they will simply lose customers, they will lose any economic advantage they have as incumbents. The fact is, KYC can be done in a trustless manner, using zero knowledge proofs, etc. KYC should not be a hang up if all of this technology gets built.

[10-Jan-19 06:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If thats what you want, then you DO NOT want LN üòÇ

[10-Jan-19 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
I'm probably not the best person to debate this. I'm not saying that LN is entirely infeasible. I'm saying there is no need for it, and the people saying we *need* it are doing harmful things such as creating artificial scarcity in block size

[10-Jan-19 06:44 AM] garbonzo607#4659
The reason why blockchain isn't mainstream is because it's expensive and isn't scalable. The tech that solves this issue will enable that world. I don't care what tech it is. But again, if you want to compete with centralized entities, I don't see how writing information to more places than centralized solutions  do will allow us to do that.

[10-Jan-19 06:45 AM] Alright#0419

It would be nice to talk about dpow here
However, dpow requires a hardfork to reverse the blockchain at prior checkpoint level. Im not a dpow expert,if sm knows about dpow it would be nice to talk
Immutability is our priority
a.s.Today at 2:32 AM
Just answered there, that if there is an interest in our community, we will try to get both side together for further discussions
phyroToday at 2:34 AM
We wont be reverting
marrychToday at 2:35 AM
@phyro you mean that we don't want to be reverting or that dpow wont be reverting?
phyroToday at 2:37 AM
we won't be reverting the chain for any reason
marrychToday at 2:38 AM
So they can just explain us how dpow works,and if there is a possibility not to revert

@Daiyox How do you make text appear as code in Discord? As you just did.

[10-Jan-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but for "routing" where you need to specify the route? that is like saying you have routing solved as long as each node just solves the routing

hub and spoke doesnt scale at all

[10-Jan-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but for poker you just need 10 nodes max

the "every client needs to provide specific routing" requirement will force having a small number of large hubs, each publishing partial routing tables to the other large hubs and all nodes would need to open channels to these large hubs. Unless you can think of some other way to solve how every node can know the route to all other nodes in a practical data transmission way

[10-Jan-19 11:48 AM] Daiyox#2701
Thanks @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[10-Jan-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
further complicating the routing is that each payment changes the channel capacity of each node on the route, thus changing the viable route in cases where there are too much funds transferred. Maybe such cases can be ignored and just retry after a failed route, but not sure how long it takes to reclaim all the funds locked in the invalid route

[10-Jan-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine you are traveling across the world and need to use planes to get from A to B. but you need to buy tickets for 1000 travelers. As plans along the best route fill up, the tickets you need change and if you have to change an already commited channel and shut it down, that takes time and costs txfees. when BTC txfees are 0.0001 it is bad enough but if it gets back to 0.001...

[10-Jan-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
you basically need to know every planes schedule, their capacity, how many places they have left

[10-Jan-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
in realtime

[10-Jan-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
then ignore the time it takes to setup channels, since it takes multiple confirmations and amounts in excess of what you want to transact to be deposited

[10-Jan-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
now you are all setup, you can send invoices to the other nodes and hope it is all processed in a timely fashion and no node along the route decided to shutdown its channel

[10-Jan-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont know about you, but I have enough difficult technical problems to solve, without having to solve an NP complete problem with no reliable good solution

[10-Jan-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
internet routing uses a trusted system of backbone providers that share their route information with each other and decide node by node how to route it. with LN, the original sender needs to figure out the route and specify it with the payment

[10-Jan-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is a much harder problem than internet routing, as it requires trustless routing and the simple act of sending funds changes the routing

[10-Jan-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810

https://discord.gg/nxj4tX

[10-Jan-19 12:42 PM] garbonzo607#4659
So internet routing uses a trusted system of backbone providers. What prevents this from being trustless? I assume we can't do something like require providers deposit funds equal to the amount being sent. If providers send inaccurate routing information, they lose their deposit?

[10-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that would ensure very few providers will provide

[10-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
already the channels hubs need to lock funds,to have to put up more deposits for providing routing info seems strange

[10-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
usually when you are providing a service you get paid for it, instead of having to pay for it

[10-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
