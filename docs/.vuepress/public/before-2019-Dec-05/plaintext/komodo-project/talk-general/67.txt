I've heard that the KMD strategy is to get exchanges to adopt "the software" - what exactly does this mean?

[16-Sep-18 04:55 PM] jspook16#3059
I havent read that. Maybe its to get them to adopt the transactions per second capability. By exchanges do you mean central exchanges?

[16-Sep-18 05:52 PM] jspook16#3059
aynbody here using the KV functionality? Im trying to use it on an asset chain and when I do a kvupdate if looks like the transaction has gone through but when I do a kvsearch for the key it does not find it. Do i need to enable something somewhere?

[16-Sep-18 05:54 PM] jspook16#3059
disregard. I didnt wait long enough ........its working üòÉ

[16-Sep-18 05:59 PM] jspook16#3059
I've got an idea. Can we use KV for a simple messagaging system in hyperdedx/barterdex? We can make the komodo address the key for direct messaging, a broadcast key for all, use an asset chain different from komodo to keep messaging cheap. What do you guys think? it may be a bit delayed ...

[16-Sep-18 06:02 PM] jspook16#3059
nevermind.....delay is about a min

[16-Sep-18 06:02 PM] jspook16#3059
thats too long for chat

[16-Sep-18 06:10 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@jspook16 you could try with a faster block time but not sure its possible...however there should be a way. Also regarding distributed storage this is in the frontier with ipfs file storage. I think KV could point to ipfs files, so there would be higher limit regarding media or attachments

[16-Sep-18 06:13 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
and btw I'm interested to play with this at some point for in-wallet chat application, seems tech behind wouldnt be much complicated...remember we just need a whitelabel thing so anyone can apply to its software, its the only way to get a sensible chat volume that can make the system survive. 

Something simple, easy, that just works. SPV clients are becoming more and more easy to build, so maybe it would be nice idea to make it available for any SPV client from scratch

And I would say to forget about paying for messging, that would leave the system out of availability for a loot of users. Remember when they asked to pay for whatsapp?  well nobody remembers because that didnt lasted long

[16-Sep-18 06:17 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah that sounds like what I was thinking. I guess i didnt mean actually "pay", i meant we could use an asset chain that didn't really have much value ,,,,kind of like a doge coin

[16-Sep-18 06:18 PM] jspook16#3059
something we can airdrop or just give out (assuming we needed  an asset chain) . Could just use a messaging server like openfire or soemthing

[16-Sep-18 06:22 PM] jspook16#3059
@kimmel (Pungo.io) I'm glad someone else is thinking about this too

[16-Sep-18 06:25 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I'm taking a look at openfire, the problem about starting from scratch is that we will probably find the same problems that already have been solved by many projects out there

[16-Sep-18 06:25 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so feels like reinventing the wheel

[16-Sep-18 06:26 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I'm not sure that is good or not...like saying "I'll do with blockchain and will work out of the box"...and then finding...maybe this guys were right about this, this this..this...and ending up solving the same problems already solved on many messaging systems out there

[16-Sep-18 06:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@kimmel (Pungo.io)  some people enjoy reinventint the wheel

[16-Sep-18 06:27 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes, some people has time and resources to do it :)... or just time hehe

[16-Sep-18 06:27 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
its a really interesting thing, I would love to see it working I love experiments

[16-Sep-18 06:27 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah im definitely not looking to reinvent the wheel or the spokes....(time limited)

[16-Sep-18 06:28 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but I need to be real about how close to production ready would this be in a short timeframe

[16-Sep-18 06:28 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
the idea looks sexy, but would need to get sorted a lot of evil details we cant just imagine right now

[16-Sep-18 06:29 PM] jspook16#3059
agreed. I was putting it out there to see what holes people can poke in it or suggestions/guidance

[16-Sep-18 06:29 PM] jspook16#3059
I guess i was just stoked about KV working.....but definitely dont require to use it for messaging

[16-Sep-18 06:30 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
KV thing its an interesting feature for many things, especially using IPFS with it

[16-Sep-18 06:30 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if we add to this the "scaling " capabilities of KMD based chains

[16-Sep-18 06:30 PM] jspook16#3059
im reading up on ipfs.....didnt know that was being implemented as well

[16-Sep-18 06:30 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
things get interesting

[16-Sep-18 06:31 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however maybe someone at komodo could help us by developing something that "just works" for any project to use it

[16-Sep-18 06:31 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
@pbca26 did a great job with agama desktop and mobile, pungo wouldnt be there without him

[16-Sep-18 06:32 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
and many other wallets either, wouldnt be there without pushing agama codebase forward

[16-Sep-18 06:33 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so KV chain + ipfs + scaled kmd chains seem a good solution that might work for usage in many projects...from chat, to file storage (dropbox alternative) or whatever

[16-Sep-18 06:37 PM] jspook16#3059
nice ....that sounds like a possible path

[16-Sep-18 06:37 PM] jspook16#3059
do you know who is working the ipfs is anyone?

[16-Sep-18 06:44 PM] PTYX#6840
i dont think anyone is directly working on ipfs yet. it has been discussed given that the keyvalue storage function works great for IPFS link storage

[16-Sep-18 06:44 PM] PTYX#6840
it's definitely something to look forward.

[16-Sep-18 06:46 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I see there are already some projects around, not sure if we could create a working group channel to work on this and if Komodo team could support us if it happens to be interest around it from different projects

we desperately need it for Komodo in order to fund community initiatives and things like the IPFS + KV Storage

[16-Sep-18 06:55 PM] jspook16#3059
that sounds interesting. Maybe we can start with a channel and then propose on @PTYX 's wallet

you don't wait for the kv tx to confirm, you can read the message as soon as it hits the mempool of your node

[16-Sep-18 08:09 PM] jspook16#3059
interesting. I asked jl about it and he said oracles cc will make kv obsolete but  maybe we can keep it alive for simple messaging. He made us an #cc-oracles channel

[16-Sep-18 11:25 PM] PTYX#6840
@1TheGhostProject the developers are not able to help you. They don't control third party mining pools.

[16-Sep-18 11:26 PM] PTYX#6840
I suggest posting on the mining pool's forums or social media channels. Ive never heard of that pool but I'll check to see if it's endorsed
