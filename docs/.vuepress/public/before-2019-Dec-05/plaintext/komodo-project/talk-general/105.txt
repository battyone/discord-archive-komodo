[18-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now I have #kmdlabs  up .. but on firiday an offical testnet will be started

[18-Oct-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think this is where we need that stuff tested...as stked is not exactly secured. ... I have nodes with no firewall and all kindsof stuff as its a playgound

[18-Oct-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also staked is not useing the exact same code as KMD, and could have problems, I am not aware of any, but it seems best to be testing the offical code if amking tests.

[18-Oct-18 03:16 AM] forkwitch#6080
@blackjok3r who can i contact for the request of access to offical testnet?

[18-Oct-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@ca333

[18-Oct-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be helping them set it up, but he is suppying servers and orginising it mostly.

[18-Oct-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its been a bit delayed was meant to start already... but people were on vcation and things

[18-Oct-18 03:17 AM] forkwitch#6080
thank you. I have written with ca333 for permission of attack. Sent him message for request

[18-Oct-18 03:17 AM] forkwitch#6080
and where can i get one notary of mainnet if the notary nodes have the key?

[18-Oct-18 03:18 AM] forkwitch#6080
asking because of interest

[18-Oct-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the pubkeys are in the komodo source... but privkeys are gaurded very well by many people... speak with ca333 though, he may let you have a node in testnet.

[18-Oct-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont be anything huge at first, just a few coins to notarise and testing things just like what you propose. If there are any attack vectors its best freindly people find them first.

[18-Oct-18 03:22 AM] forkwitch#6080
i have read some more lines of the iguana code with regex search for ips. I found the treasure üôÇ  ???

[18-Oct-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not hard to find the IPs ü§£

[18-Oct-18 03:24 AM] forkwitch#6080
I am interested a lot in helping here and having a node in testnet and maybe also mainnet.

[18-Oct-18 03:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
blackjok3r it is not hard finding something. Sometime its hard to look/search for it.

[18-Oct-18 03:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
Finding is easy part

[18-Oct-18 03:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
If i go into a main net node and take it over. Do i get one for me for reward?

[18-Oct-18 03:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
maybe i find something already

[18-Oct-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been messing with iguana code for months now... if you manage to work out how it works your very smart. It took hundreds of hours here, but I am no C coder, at least I wasnt when I started... now am noob c coder üòÑ

[18-Oct-18 03:26 AM] forkwitch#6080
good i try and work hard for the goal

[18-Oct-18 03:26 AM] forkwitch#6080
The dPoW is very interesting for me because it is different to the tokens applications and codes who are all the same shit

[18-Oct-18 03:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its pretty revolutionary...

[18-Oct-18 03:27 AM] forkwitch#6080
I believe i see little weakness maybe. But when we solve all risks in it i believe this can be the solution for pow waste of energy and globe pollution

{Reactions}
üôè 

[18-Oct-18 03:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
maybe all pow tokens can also remove the pow rewards?

[18-Oct-18 03:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
or only some part of it

[18-Oct-18 03:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
because this can also help the world

[18-Oct-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have already done thins like this in #kmdlabs

[18-Oct-18 03:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
and network is secure by dpow

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made a chain that has a single miner only

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by hte chain creator... with 0 BR

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] forkwitch#6080
good one

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its effectivly a token, only security is dPoW

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] forkwitch#6080
then inflation goes away also

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[18-Oct-18 03:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
0.001 coins is minted on each block, then spent to mine the next block

[18-Oct-18 03:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
and that is one of the few problems we have in pow system

[18-Oct-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to work out how to burn it instead or sending to a random address, then it wil be bettter

[18-Oct-18 03:30 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not all chains will need a reward/inflation mechanism, its forward thinking

{Reactions}
üëè 

[18-Oct-18 03:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
then dpow solves =

a. inflation
b. security
c. inefficiency of mining model
d. global pollution/energy waste

[18-Oct-18 03:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
Some more points i have easy

[18-Oct-18 03:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
For pow tokens this is a good thing

[18-Oct-18 03:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why dont other tokens use it?

[18-Oct-18 03:31 AM] forkwitch#6080
Look at Florincoin, i can attack it with 5GPB

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] forkwitch#6080
full doublespend after reorg chain of 30 blocks

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... I made the chain I am working on have static difficulty ... so it has unlimited bandwidth too... single miner ... its early days, but I see there needing to be a way to have a fallback miner, incase the main one fails or gets diconnected ... also is ondemand blocks, only mines when there is a transaction. So the chain does not needlesly bloat to large sizes.

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why this tokens have no dPoW? Its opensource?

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its opensource but hard to get working ...

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] forkwitch#6080
why?

[18-Oct-18 03:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  has made great progress porting it to difffrent code bases

[18-Oct-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it lays the ground work for eveything to use it

[18-Oct-18 03:33 AM] forkwitch#6080
why porting? you use it on different systems with different coding languages???

[18-Oct-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also made it possible to have infinty notary node networks with #kmdlabs

[18-Oct-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so we dont need to have one centralised set of 64 doing all the work.

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the main KMD 64 should focus one KMD->BTC then infinity networks cant noarise to KMD .

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until KMd runs out of block space that is

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@forkwitch  costs associated  and people are still shopping around ,  florincoin

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] forkwitch#6080
@Deleted User what is different so you need to port it for other daemons?

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] forkwitch#6080
I thought its a own application?

[18-Oct-18 03:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the detection of notaisation transaction is on the deamon code itself

[18-Oct-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
C/c++ code. ... duke has done most of the work there

[18-Oct-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its easily added to most coins

[18-Oct-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main part ies in ConnectBlock

[18-Oct-18 03:35 AM] forkwitch#6080
Ok i think i see that in the codes. Notarization and MOMOM code functions of Komodo things in the main codes and rpc interface changes

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
MoMoM is extra layer still in testing ...

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
disabled in most coins I think ..if not all .

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked is using it. pretty amazing magic stuf

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but buggy at this point 2-5% of the time has problem.

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] forkwitch#6080
I see this in the commits and always related to the notarization functions

[18-Oct-18 03:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Protected chain needs to use that info hence why in that coins daemon and not a standalone,  standalone adds another relay from my understanding

[18-Oct-18 03:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
its always maybe in the parameters like a momomdata and parameter like notarizedheight

[18-Oct-18 03:37 AM] forkwitch#6080
or notarizedhash

[18-Oct-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
standaloone is silly ... unless added as plugin type thing to coin deamon ü§î

[18-Oct-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the official pubkeys need to be sorted ...having somehting like this: https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/blob/master/src/notaries_staked.cpp
will het hard to manage at some point.

james has mentioned a hash table ... sorted by timstamp

[18-Oct-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I dont know how to make that yet... maybe in a few more months when i get more C experiance

[18-Oct-18 03:40 AM] forkwitch#6080
yes that is good idea

[18-Oct-18 03:41 AM] forkwitch#6080
Maybe he means DHT for storage of pubkeys to keep separate and more flexible if comes to change and update of this data.

[18-Oct-18 03:41 AM] forkwitch#6080
Lots of p2p technologies take usage of it, when you need a help on it give me shout

üëå 

[18-Oct-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it needs to be blockheight activated (you can ues timestamp of blocks though, i tested it lots with that code there)

[18-Oct-18 03:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Something like kv maybe

{Reactions}
üëç 

[18-Oct-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it needs somewhere to get the pubkeys from, that someone cannot change

[18-Oct-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KV is depreciated by oracles

[18-Oct-18 03:42 AM] forkwitch#6080
More like Kademilia to remove risk layer

[18-Oct-18 03:42 AM] forkwitch#6080
eth in example use this technology

[18-Oct-18 03:42 AM] forkwitch#6080
for p2p discovery and such things

With #dPoW it is not possible to reorg|doublespend beyond specific range. This is when notarizations of dPoW happen, compare it to a checkpoint. Users and exchanges watch out for notarizations!! They are the real confirmations! @KomodoPlatform @geocold51 #dpowtechnology #M...

@forkwitch donate hashing power like? point miner to a stratum of your given address?

[18-Oct-18 04:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
Maybe disclosure of the stratum host is a bad idea for opsec?

[18-Oct-18 04:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
Does nicehash have vouchers or giftcards?
