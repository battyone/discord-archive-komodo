@Acura there can be a million spam chains created, but each application (agama, dex, etc.) gets to choose which chains they care about. there is no centralized chain that displays all chains ever created

[22-Feb-19 02:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Exactly, it's possible blocknet misconstrued the line of questioning as if binance was going to work with them.

[22-Feb-19 03:44 AM] ca333#0118
@Steve Lee @linuxcaptain - yes, CC could be used in 'endless' different IoT tech usecases. Just imagine a special IoT smart door for places you have to pay entry - the door has an interface to open/close the door. The IoT device software connects to a kmd rpc cc interface and utilize CC tech to handle access/auth/payment plus it can create an unforgeable accesslog thanks to the dPoW technology - this was one from thousands CC IoT usecases. 

Slotmachine (HW) with CC is a cool one - if you give James some raspberry pi slotmachine opensource game written in C i am sure he could transform it into a 'CCfied' version in no time and your rasbPI slotmachine turns a CC Slotmachine - with SLOT tokens for example.

[22-Feb-19 03:52 AM] ca333#0118
with rasbPI you need either gateway solution/rpc interface access in same net (from PI) or SPV CC. If you wanted it native i think there are limitations with ARM arch. Without PI and just on computer it likely is much simpler to code.

[22-Feb-19 04:34 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
hmm. this helped a lot @ca333 . The example with the IoT door..One more question..  Is komodo able to store data on the block chain? I mean some bytes that represent something. For example lets say if I want to store position or temperature data every 10minutes is it doable?

[22-Feb-19 04:37 AM] ca333#0118
yes @linuxcaptain - Komodo can natively use blockchain as database-system with simplified r/w interface. And your point was actually a good example - the data you name such as sensor data is optimal for BC storage since very tiny.
