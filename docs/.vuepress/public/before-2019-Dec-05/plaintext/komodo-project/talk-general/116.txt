however the spawning of the chains etc, will  leverage those, without them its pretty much imposible to do.

[26-Oct-18 01:22 PM] crumb#2550
what is the Komodo discord policy regarding users taking the name of existing user? i just found that there is a   user named crumb#1885 that is not me. i was the only user with that name here last time i checked.
just trying to avoid situations where someone can mistake his words and actions as mine. 
@KomodoWorld @CryptoNinjaa

[26-Oct-18 01:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
not sure, could be a coincidence that he choose the same nick

[26-Oct-18 01:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@crumb

[26-Oct-18 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I noticed there are two blackbeards as well

[26-Oct-18 01:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which could cause confusion as one is a trusted escrower and the other isnt

[26-Oct-18 01:26 PM] crumb#2550
the new crumb has zero posting history

[26-Oct-18 01:28 PM] crumb#2550
just trying to point this out as it might bring some confusion. new @crumb please change your nick to something else

[26-Oct-18 01:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I propose to kick him if he doesn't answer in  a reasonable time

@Blackbeard you too can clarify?

[26-Oct-18 01:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not sure either @crumb - Maybe we could ask @crumb if he wants to choose another name to stop any confusion.

[26-Oct-18 01:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i would agree that if no response then we should remove them, but it doesnt stop anyone else form doing so.

[26-Oct-18 01:35 PM] crumb#2550
yes. best thing is to give him a chance to change the name or if he ignores us, then banhammer to the rescue

I wonder if it would be too much work to make evry member a different coulor like im yellow, we could make everyone whos here now red or blue and then any new comers would be white and need turning red or blue etc so we could check that way..

i need a video series for how to stake arrr coin

[27-Oct-18 03:50 AM] bishop#9773
@Sekerci ARRR isn't stakable

[27-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Sekerci#1428
then how to pow. is there any wallet shortcut?

First go at STAKED streamer over real internet!
Seems there might have been a small chunk of the file missing off the end, I need to investigate, however all the data in the TGZ extracted and was received ...

[27-Oct-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes thats right I uploaded a blockchain into a blockchain ðŸ˜„

[27-Oct-18 04:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Delayed Delayed Proof of Work?

[27-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Didnt notarise it no... Just needed to get something done to prove it works before I take a day off.

[27-Oct-18 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And so others can try and test it ... I used the repo of scripts I posted very late last night... it all works.

[27-Oct-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least 99% works .. not sure why the tgz got cut off at the end, but all the files were there after extracting it ... the file gets split up and converted from hex to string about 5 times during the whole process, I'm surprised it works at all tbh....

[27-Oct-18 04:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But its pretty freeking fast right ðŸ˜„

[27-Oct-18 04:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Isn't what you just did there, a centralised version of dPoW?

[27-Oct-18 04:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
In relation to uploading a blockchain onto another blockchain that is controlled by 1 person

[27-Oct-18 04:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
so you now have a time stamp (notarisation if you like) of that initial blockchain

[27-Oct-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmmm I guess so ... Alright said he wanted to use a stream chain to save a copy of any chain ever in STAKED ... so a permanant copy is always avalibe after they are removed from the cluster

[27-Oct-18 04:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
CdPoW :trollface:

[27-Oct-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You mean *more* centralised :trollface:

[27-Oct-18 04:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
True ðŸ˜›

[27-Oct-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This tech along with staked, takes notarisation adn makes it distributed

[27-Oct-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So there can be infinity notary node networks

[27-Oct-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
People can no longer yell centralisation

[27-Oct-18 04:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
how does staked add to that

[27-Oct-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked is how the chains will be notarised ... basically once its finished a notary node will be a docker image

[27-Oct-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use that to spin up a whole notary network

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on demand... along with the streamre chain  (or any other ondemand chain you can think of) and notarise it

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once finished it can all disappear

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
so the whole 'notary network' will be the staked miners?

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure yet

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still many things to work out .

[27-Oct-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at first it will be a set netowrk of staked notaries

[27-Oct-18 04:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wait, so you mean you could have a notary node chain that would use it's miners to conduct the notarisation instead of the 64 notaries?

[27-Oct-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but setting it up is so simple anyone cna just make their own, they dont HAVE to use ours, but ours will be cheaper.

[27-Oct-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not exactly... the notary nodes are still notary nodes the same as KMD ones, but they run a diffrent network and st of pukeys

[27-Oct-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really need a way to store the pubkeys i a blockchain, once that is solved then its trivial to start a chain (or chains) and a notary network to notarise those chains.

[27-Oct-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD notary nodes are always there, to notarise KMD->BTC but they simply cannot handle thousands or millions of chains...

[27-Oct-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to distribute the load

[27-Oct-18 04:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So you're solving the notary issue created by the Streamed chain having as many chains as people want, by using staked to distribute notarisations

[27-Oct-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in a nutshell yes ... in making staked, we inadvertantly created a way for AC's to have diffrent notary nodes to KMD while using the same code base and binaries...

[27-Oct-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which means, that once I can figure out how to remove the pubkeys from the source code and have it loaded from a blockchain, you can have aas many notary nodes netowrks as you want each for diffrent chains, all notarising to KMD.

[27-Oct-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They can be permenant like staked will be, or simplyt an ondeamnd network, for streamer chains, or things similar to that.

[27-Oct-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Obviously... most of the uses case for this will be centralised, but as its mostly a thing for data, not currency I dont see much of an isssue with that. ðŸ˜ƒ

[27-Oct-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The network is still p2p and distributed/decentralised

[27-Oct-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So its a good way to make sure your data cannot be censored or removed from the internet

[27-Oct-18 05:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is wild

[27-Oct-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And having multiple netowrks of notary nodes, introduces more competition

[27-Oct-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which can only be good

[27-Oct-18 05:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I like the idea of creating a chain that's service is notarisation. Coin holders get paid a dividend of the notarisation fees

[27-Oct-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes something like that ... staked will be that ... but we still need to work out exactly how it will work.

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
staked will be 50% PoS

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so holders get coins anyway

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the ddemand for the coin comes from the notarisation fees

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which will be much higher than KMD charges btw ...

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah exactly

[27-Oct-18 05:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We hope to get a KMD notary node for staked, which will supply the KMD needed to pay for notaisations

[27-Oct-18 05:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then the whole thing can run with STAKED as its currency

[27-Oct-18 05:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So Staked will be notarised onto KMD?

[27-Oct-18 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it already is

[27-Oct-18 05:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all testnet chains are notarised to KMD

[27-Oct-18 05:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Notary nodes will be paid per notariation OR a percentage of the minign rewards, like a founderss fee... still not 100% sure on details, still working these things out, we hope to make an annoumcment and launch STAKED as a chain soon.

[27-Oct-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh and anyone can be a notary node really... as long as it does not exceed 64, as thats the highest it can go. after that a seperate netowrk would need to be used to compete with staked itself.

[27-Oct-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each notary node can basically choose which chains to notarise

[27-Oct-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by deciding what oracles it will trust to supply its chain parameters

[27-Oct-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Imagine if every notary node for KMD did something similar ... used a KMD notary node to run a whole network of notary nodes ðŸ¤”

[27-Oct-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then we really could support milions of blockchains.

[27-Oct-18 05:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Dunno about everyone else, but my mind is blowing thinking about it
