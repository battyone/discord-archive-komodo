yeah I did this just because it's a woman. 🙃  I did it because after crosschecking LinkedIn account and RG account, nothing was matching. Then I found out that nobody checked if she was from IBM.

no wonder some people wish to remain anonymous in crypto space. sooner or later someone disagrees with them on some issue and when they are out of technical arguments, someone digs up some post from decade ago and sh*itstorm follows.

like people can't be versatile or make some questionable choices in their lives. does it make the code less effective if it turns out a person was a marine biologist before discovering crypto?

private account, dont feel like requesting to follow her

[10-May-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be she is using a pseudonym

[10-May-19 02:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now who does such a thing 🤔

[10-May-19 02:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was a joke, as I assume james lee is a pseudonym :p

[10-May-19 02:39 PM] ca333#0118
still waiting for reply from IBM - if fake then the twitter accounts were just bought

[10-May-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if she isnt using her realname, we wont be able to confirm her status

[10-May-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
seems we need to ask her

@ca333 didn't she tag you in a lot of tweets, weeks ago?

[10-May-19 02:43 PM] ca333#0118
thanks @Deleted User - in this case its a confirmed fake. I guess no need to wait for IBM reply and just report her on twitter, linkedin, and so on.

interesting if true these type of games being played

[10-May-19 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
what i mean with tagging is that i assumed ca333 and that lydia were in contact. but apparently ca333 only contacted them yesterday, so i wondered if he noticed someone (allegedly) from IBM tagged him weeks ago

[10-May-19 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
not that it matters now anyways

[10-May-19 02:45 PM] jorian#4555
another question: but why?

[10-May-19 02:46 PM] jorian#4555
someone from here trying to boost the price?

[10-May-19 02:46 PM] jorian#4555
why would anyone else do this

[10-May-19 02:46 PM] klein#5233
pump and dump long term bad

[10-May-19 02:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
arent there more easy coins for such a p&d?

[10-May-19 02:46 PM] klein#5233
should not be trying to attract these type of people

[10-May-19 02:47 PM] az#1921
@jorian  100 $ she will soon ask for money or something on behalf of IBM to mislead KMD users

[10-May-19 02:47 PM] klein#5233
actually yeah that sounds more likely

[10-May-19 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks @az could only make that bet if controlling the account 🤔_

🤑 😄 

[10-May-19 02:49 PM] ca333#0118
many potential reasons:

a) trying to indirectly harm komodo by getting us to RT, share, etc. and make it look like we are involved in the fake - with a well coordinated and organized strategy this can lead to even further (legal) issues
b) p&d strategy not excluding a)
c) just for the lulz - building up a fake ID persona with good reputation - can likely get her/thenm some $$
d) and so on

[10-May-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible theyhave some real projects, just not official ibm ones

[10-May-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the screen shots had some plausible content on them

[10-May-19 02:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just try to contact them and ask who they really are

[10-May-19 02:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now I'm curious for the reasons why

[10-May-19 02:50 PM] jorian#4555
yes, the screenshots are a thing too.. very weird scenario. someone wanna call them?

[10-May-19 02:54 PM] ca333#0118
@jorian - call whom?

[10-May-19 02:54 PM] Malti#3948
@ca333 you are in contact with her in twitter right? could you ask in DM?

[10-May-19 02:54 PM] ca333#0118
i already did @Malti - i sent her a DM as soon as i talked to IBM.

[10-May-19 02:55 PM] Malti#3948
alright

[10-May-19 02:55 PM] Malti#3948
now it's a matter of waiting

[10-May-19 02:55 PM] ca333#0118
i had a phonecall with IBM Research & Development GmbH and with IBM Germany GmbH yesterday - and both assured me that there is no Lydia Schafer or Lydia Schäfer working for them.

[10-May-19 02:55 PM] az#1921
@ca333  no answer yet ? I talked to her today by DM and she banned me.

[10-May-19 02:56 PM] Malti#3948
my key takeaway from wat you say is that in any case KMD is in contact with IBM :troll_hurt:

[10-May-19 02:56 PM] ca333#0118
however - there was still the possibility of her being an external employee - that is what we tried to verify/validate hence why we wanted to wait for official response from IBM. But since Emmanuel was able to validate the fake through the former account-owner its sorted.

[10-May-19 02:57 PM] klein#5233
IBM blockchain twitter follows allot of people

[10-May-19 02:57 PM] Malti#3948

[10-May-19 02:57 PM] klein#5233

[10-May-19 02:58 PM] ca333#0118
yes - a big thanks to @az for alerting us!
