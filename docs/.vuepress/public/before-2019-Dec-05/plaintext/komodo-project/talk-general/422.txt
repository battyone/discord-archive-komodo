They aren't worth all the bitching, that's for sure. I'm also a little upset dwy went nuclear after selling nodes. I recall hours of complaints about the is in formatting, but no effort in making a PR, which I did in like 5 minutes. Complaining about problems is easy, offering solutions not so much. And complaining about proposed solution s without an alternative proposal is unproductive.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator refusing to do a PR is just a question about pride, both from JL, and me. Submitting stuff for update was done so many times. I don t see what s unprofessionnal about saying things that have to change. Tried so much in priv and nothing was done. The professionalism would be to handle git a very better way, giving the people and holders a way to decide for those type of decisions, stop doing things that just a minority vote for emselves. Being agile in so much subjects. It s easy to blame when you re into those conversations only from 3 monthes, it s harder to see that it needs monthes of warning to get people realize there is an issue.

K64 is the perfect example : no proof of anything, conclusions based on nothing, and fire starts. Professionalism would be to check, verify, and take conclusions after, not based on nothing making people doubting based on nothing more than : we don t know so it must be true it s false

[05-Sep-19 04:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think the hack and the way it was handled showed the strength of the project. everyone with the exception of jl was made whole. As for the NN drama, I would venture that the shit that goes on behind closed doors with other projects would make it look incredibly tame by comparison. It's no excuse, but the system is the first of it's kind and there are no best practices to follow. I'm amazed that this amalgamation of random people from across the planet can agree on anything at all, much less run an enterprise level, secure network that has resisted any and all attacks, even internal ones.

not changing your behaviour and admit there were failures, and saying things like you just did is not constructive. when will happen the next epic fail will depend on how you ll judge the flaws had to be fixed earlier. history repeats unless people realize they need to improve it

acting bad would have been handling this a very different way, but I chosed the soft one and you know that

[05-Sep-19 05:09 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
each issue except the json? And though potential solutions may have been vocalised and discussed, just because NN consensus chose an alternative (after long and arduous conversation), does not excuse going nuclear. CG repeats his points ad nauseum, but manages to maintain a level of grudging acceptance and mirth when it goes another way. Your "offer" to sell nodes was repeated and there was no interest until it your consistent disgruntled disruption wore people down enough to capitulate so we could get on with work. You took your profits and then assumed a half month of ownership was due a full month of the mining, and in not getting your way I assume you resumed your disgruntled disruption.  Maybe I'm not privy to everything, but this is what I saw. As it was happening I expressed that your insights had merit, though I completely disagree with how you have acted, regardless of any emotional distress you have been experiencing from outside KMD. Though extreme emotional stress may explain actions, it does not excuse them. I told you to take a break and get some air, shit I even tipped you to get a massage while on holiday. Sometimes a step back can reveal a more effective route forward. In my experience, rash acts while under emotional duress tend to moke this worse, not better.

[05-Sep-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm all for the insights of contrarian opinion and learning from fails. Not so much a fan of dramatics and personal attacks

[05-Sep-19 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
stuff like this is just once again a total neglecting on how governance failed. Personal matters are easy to come up with. reconsider your way to handle stuff that happened to avoid history to repeat is the way to go. Saying : please relax is just summarizing all those issues with : this guy is emotional and went nuclear

[05-Sep-19 05:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[05-Sep-19 05:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Things changed. Maybe you are not aware after you left the conversation. I work daily to improve KMD and test its tech, and I'm not the only one. I have my opinions, but tend to keep them to myself while listening to others, until I have better understanding of where I might be wrong, and refrain from striking out when my opinion is not the one that is chosen. Governance is interactive, and reducing it to the those that shout loudest is not ideal. I'm not spending all day going in circles discussing this, I'd rather dive back into code and prodcutively improve the things I am able to.
