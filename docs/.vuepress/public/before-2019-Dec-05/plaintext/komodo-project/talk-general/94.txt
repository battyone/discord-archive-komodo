"Ok so we're sticking to the bitcoin thing... But if privacy comes up, we only say Monero... Ok?"

I don't think 👆🏼 that is quite the thing for that article, for that stuff it's usually either paid for or they are just a fanboy

"Zk-snarks are quite impressive..."

"Shush! No! Monero!"

It's a bit disappointing to see Fluffypony promoting it. It's full of holes that I'm sure he can see.

does anyone know if you accumulate KMD interest when using Z addresses?

[11-Oct-18 12:10 AM] furshure123#1929
and how would you claim it if so?

[11-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Hermes#6934
This is something that I am not familiar with in order to claim rewards we use normal t addresses , z addresses are used for Jumblr function most of the time.

[11-Oct-18 12:24 AM] furshure123#1929
good to know thanks!

[11-Oct-18 12:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I do not believe you collect interest in a z addr for KMD

[11-Oct-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Z address cannot get rewards

this guy is actually doing what I suggested - exposing shitty/scam projects with no 51% protection:

we can actually suppose anything without 51% protection is scam / someone will loose funds/assets/money

[11-Oct-18 05:37 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this should initiate a wave of coins being delisted from CEXes, as CEX is the one that can loose real money here ?

guys am getting this message "error unable to get transaction history.. and it is waiting for sync while this message pops up. Welp!!!

[11-Oct-18 06:30 AM] FishyGuts#5085
How's that for the five bullet friday or tech tuesday @benohanlon 😄

[11-Oct-18 06:33 AM] Catalyst#8405
Plus it is showing my previous balance not the updated balance. I have the latest agama installed

[11-Oct-18 06:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well there goes the most unique viral marketing opportunity in recent crypto history

[11-Oct-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the notary nodes are working properly we should just attack it ourselvs

[11-Oct-18 06:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
“Uh... it didn’t work... arghh it’s dpow!

[11-Oct-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean, hell we have been attacking staked chains with 51% attacks from the very first week there... and they never work

[11-Oct-18 06:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you just fork your own daemon/copy of the chain locally

[11-Oct-18 06:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah i have no idea how it would have gone down.

[11-Oct-18 06:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess it’s still good press.

couldn't help myself got me  some more $kmd

[11-Oct-18 09:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@PTYX  @FishyGuts  could we have another user category in here? My proposition is to have "Recognized comunity member" category after "ecosystem devs"

[11-Oct-18 09:31 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
reason: it's different when someone is longer in here then just new random user

[11-Oct-18 09:32 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
some people are not official in the team but can be recognized as trusted for 1. long being here and actively participating in discord 2. doing trades, escrows and so on

[11-Oct-18 09:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for example @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  could fit there, also maybe myself 😃

[11-Oct-18 09:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also would be great to have another category "notary node operator"

[11-Oct-18 09:33 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also kind of trusted user

[11-Oct-18 09:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@CHMEX  @polycryptoblog  would you agree?

[11-Oct-18 09:35 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it also builds up community when you recognize some good users :pirate:

[11-Oct-18 10:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
We already have this role @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋

[11-Oct-18 10:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
is this a role? or more a recognition ?

[11-Oct-18 10:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Im not really talking about specific role, just someone participating long enough to have more trust then not participating or new

[11-Oct-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 too many people already assume I have some "official" team function because of the staker role, another color wouldn't change that 😛

[11-Oct-18 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and NNs already have a role, which is why dwy's name is purple (which is what he meant by "we")

[11-Oct-18 11:07 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok but how can someone knwo colors here have some meaning ?

[11-Oct-18 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
Click the username and look under `roles`

[11-Oct-18 11:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok but I;m not talking about roles :trollface:

[11-Oct-18 11:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
beside CG got none

[11-Oct-18 11:09 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
my concern is we could have some recognition which is not the same as <> != role

[11-Oct-18 11:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
role = discord's way of showing any category

can I get a native pirate role ? :coolpirate:

[11-Oct-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
STAKED is a chain that Alright and blackjok3r are developing -- "staker" means that we are participating in their testing and it helps them notify us of changes

[11-Oct-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED is a cluster of chains 😛

[11-Oct-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
more than 1

[11-Oct-18 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-Oct-18 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
If there any lack of trust from you side maybe other team members will glad to help you since I'm just for a few months with Komodo

[11-Oct-18 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Since escrow role is made both parties feel no any lack of trust

[11-Oct-18 11:58 AM] hastrup#8742
the trust is there from my side. you would not be on the team if you where not trusted. but to convince my trade partner it would be nice if jl777 say yes. we will come make an write agrment so there will be no condusen
