having Segwit coin BTC go up like this is amazing as I mine it to fund the real #Bitcoin #BSV.  But it does show you how uneducated the market is about the value of utility.  BSV is still the only undervalued long term digital asset because of its ability to scale massively

Trying to pull a test amount 20 KMD off Binance and I am getting a not enough error. I boosted the amount and still get the error. There is no hold on Binance KMD anymore. Has anyone else run into this issue?

about this vuln in vlc media player:
https://thehackernews.com/2019/06/vlc-media-player-hacking.html

_Though the proof-of-concepts demonstrated by both researchers cause a crash, a potential attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution with the same privileges as of the target user on the system._
how do you guys think the step from causing a crash to code execution with the original users rights can be done?
Is that a standard code injection/ privilege escalation technique, or does it need more very special circumstances to be successful??

wasnt there some sort of requirement to divulge your passwords?

[23-Jun-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, would that apply to privkeys as that is sort of like a password

[23-Jun-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so USSA can make things very simple at the border. force divulging of the privkey, send all the crypto to the IRS and let them sort out how much you get to keep

[23-Jun-19 02:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
