Hear gun shots fairly often. Usually putting down animals or hunting.

[21-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where ever there are the most guns ther is te least crime ... atm in in an actual town, so guns not so much, crime is high

[21-Nov-18 06:19 AM] ch6ris#5240
I'm right on the edge of a small town surrounded by farmland.

[21-Nov-18 06:27 AM] ch6ris#5240

Yep, that's good advice. Didn't work for what his name silkroad dude.

if silkroad case teaches us anything, it's that the US can do very shitty parallel construction(that makes 0 sense) and put them in prison for life

My gmail says ‚Äúgoogle is watching‚Äù whenever I hover the cursor over my address on gmail. Feels like they are trolling me.

[21-Nov-18 06:33 AM] ch6ris#5240
Well google hold onto data for a very long time, he's mistake was typing he's personal google/yahoo/whatever account at the very early stage of silkroad.

[21-Nov-18 06:34 AM] ch6ris#5240
One tiny mistake "royally fucked"

[21-Nov-18 06:35 AM] ch6ris#5240
the way way back, I do agree though that it is fairly simple to create a new alias completely separate from yourself. You also need to hide in plain sight in the crowd.

[21-Nov-18 06:36 AM] ch6ris#5240
I personally don't have one but having one can help "hide in plain sight"

[21-Nov-18 06:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The way I see it... is we either win, or we dont ... and if we dont win... living on this planet wont be that fun, so who really cares if your identity is hidden or not

[21-Nov-18 06:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
It's fun either way, the alternative is nothingness.

[21-Nov-18 06:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
Nothing to hide here. idgaf anymore. There‚Äôs enough people in crypto now that it does not make you nearly as interesting as it used to.

[21-Nov-18 06:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
If you have nothing to hide then it should not matter anyway :trollface:

[21-Nov-18 06:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
And i have private emails

[21-Nov-18 06:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
Gmail is just for normal bs

[21-Nov-18 06:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
yes bills, government stuff, etc.

[21-Nov-18 06:43 AM] ch6ris#5240
I still use an encrypted mailbox for that. but it's no big deal for essential identity things.

[21-Nov-18 06:44 AM] ch6ris#5240
If i ever have to give a company/hospital/whatever my email, there like @ what? I've never heard of that before.

@AkiraX it depends on the situation, and different branches of math like to define it differently. 0^0=1 is what C language `pow` returns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero

Zero to the power of zero
Zero to the power of zero, denoted by 00, is a mathematical expression with no agreed-upon value. The most common possibilities are 1 or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context.

[22-Nov-18 02:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
some people care more about 0^x, where x goes to 0. others care more about x^0, where x goes to 0. The first function is equal to 0 for all x>0, while the second is equal to 1 for all x>0. So whether you define 0^0 as 0 or 1 depends on which function you would like to be continuous/differentiable at zero üòÉ

1/10 A few thoughts in this thread about @KomodoPlatform and how to explain it to people who are new. I've heard #FUD that there are too many projects or tech... I want to try to explain why that is a feature and not a bug (from a non-dev point of view). #crypto #fintech
