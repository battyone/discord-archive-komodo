for all time @crumb @KomodoWorld ^^

[18-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Llama#1330
Can we opt out of getting tagged by the rain bot?

[18-Oct-18 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
you can mute botchat channel @Llama 
there is another option, that is only if you don't want to get tip from anyone

[18-Oct-18 06:22 PM] SHossain#0007
i.e.: excluding your id from tipbot's database

[18-Oct-18 06:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Llama you can set yourself to offline and you'll not get any

[18-Oct-18 06:25 PM] SHossain#0007
and, that too ^^

[18-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Llama#1330
Well

[18-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Llama#1330
I don’t want that

If you want the free sats, then you get the lil red numbers

[18-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Llama#1330
I just exclude me

[18-Oct-18 06:28 PM] Llama#1330
Only from the rains and soaks tho

[18-Oct-18 06:28 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no exclude like that.

[18-Oct-18 06:29 PM] SHossain#0007

what if i have few legit use-cases/ideas for projects and business models for each of them and want to build on KMD but not enough programming skills, just designing and newbie level coding. what are the possibilities here? the KMD community seems friendly

[18-Oct-18 07:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For the right price, you can almost always find someone with skills

[18-Oct-18 07:23 PM] CryptAiz#8085
i see.

[18-Oct-18 07:24 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could speak with @PTYX and chainzilla or checkout #chainmakers ?

[18-Oct-18 07:30 PM] CryptAiz#8085
cool. i will head there.

[18-Oct-18 07:55 PM] ch6ris#5240
@sφldat Thanks for the tip on uBlock Origin, I did have adblock installed not plus. From what I've read plus is in the pockets of big money and adblock has an unclear development team.

You are extremely wrong here buddy

[18-Oct-18 09:58 PM] CryptoHuff#7952
You are not suited for marketing position.

[18-Oct-18 10:15 PM] crumb#2550
@CryptoHuff perhaps you should reconsider your approach here in this channel. i have not seen you contributing to conversations here. you just ask random times about people's portfolios and push your own site. this is more tech oriented bunch here. if you actually contribute with your knowledge you'd probably get better reception. unfortunately all you do is push your own site. not cool dude...

@CryptoHuff He may or may not be "suited for marketing position", but I am certain that the average quadriplegic has a better future in sign-flipping than you have in continuing to spam on this server 😛

@CryptoHuff Since you sit on the highest pedestal in the court of shitty marketing, let me ask you a question. When exactly do you take NO as an answer? Or do you keep coming until you're close enough to whisper in our ear "Just let it happen"?

[18-Oct-18 10:43 PM] Pete#8419

Pirate coin is also part of Komodo?

[19-Oct-18 02:25 AM] damodar#8781
Bcaz pirate home is redirecting to Komodo discord

[19-Oct-18 02:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes it's part of the ecosystem

[19-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Llama#1330
@damodar there is a distinction between the two, though.

[19-Oct-18 02:57 AM] jspook16#3059
Pirate is not an asset chain from what I understand but a fork, like verus

[19-Oct-18 02:58 AM] jspook16#3059
If I'm wrong someone please correct me

[19-Oct-18 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're wrong, it's a pure assetchain that uses the forced privacy feature

[19-Oct-18 03:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the confusion might be from the "runtime fork" term that means that the daemon can support multiple instances with multiple configs

[19-Oct-18 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The runtime forf stuff is really powerful, what Ive been able to make using it the last few weeks is quite amazing... still works with any komodo AC or KMD, but `add -ac_stream=1 and -ac_pubkey=02xxx`  and its something totally diffrent to any blockhain ever created.

[19-Oct-18 04:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
lmao scared I lost all my kmd after cpu issues, and I had to do a force reinstall. 

I have my notes with a password, I have a WIF but it’s only 12 words long. when I use it I don’t see the deposit address I used, and 0 balance. 

right now I went to import key and put my kmd password that I used in the past. is this possible to recover my wallet? 😂😂😂

am I s.o.l. on recovering my wallet?

[19-Oct-18 04:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Write it out on a doc file on the pc instead of typing it directly into agama, then verify then paste it in once you know there are no mistakes

[19-Oct-18 04:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when I use it I don’t see the deposit address I used`
Then something about it isn't the same (a space, a cap letter, something)

[19-Oct-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
It’s a password I made so I’m not sure if that’s the encrypted version, or. I don’t think I have the correct WIF since it’s not showing the deposit address. im getting more confident I lost all my kmd. 

I was just gaming, and my pc turned off, and when it came back on I had to do a factory install on windows.

[19-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Llama#1330
Do u have your private keys backed up?

[19-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I also thought I wrote it down, but I’m looking everywhere and I can’t find anything. that’s my fault there being unorganized, or not sure if I even wrote it to store initially.

[19-Oct-18 05:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I only know my password to the wallet that’s it.

[19-Oct-18 05:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know my deposit address too. I checked on explorer and the balance is there. depressing.

[19-Oct-18 05:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I had everything backed up on my pc before it stopped working :/ I was recovering bunch of wallets, and kmd is where I can’t recover it.

[19-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Llama#1330
You need the private keys. Maybe somehow get it from your hard drive. I’m sure the file haven’t been overwritten.

[19-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
I went to system restore and i don’t have previous system restore points. I tried %appdata% trick and I’m not sure what to do.

[19-Oct-18 05:24 AM] Hermes#6934
You know the pin.but no the passphrase right?

[19-Oct-18 05:24 AM] Hermes#6934
@Deleted User

[19-Oct-18 05:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I believe so. like it’s a normal password. uppercase lowercase special character number

[19-Oct-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
But the complex wallet looking thing I don’t have which is what I’m referring to as the WIF.

[19-Oct-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
I also do not have the word recovery.

[19-Oct-18 05:26 AM] Hermes#6934
Which OS are you using ?

[19-Oct-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Windows 10.

[19-Oct-18 05:26 AM] Hermes#6934
You don’t see the Komodo folder inside %appdata% Roaming path ?

[19-Oct-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I see it yes but I wasn’t sure if it would pick up from previous windows install.

[19-Oct-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
like cause I launched it again on this new install so I thought it was only showing me cause I ran it once on the new install. (Current)

[19-Oct-18 05:28 AM] Hermes#6934
Hmmm so this is a new installation from scratch and you don’t have the past wallet.dat file ?

[19-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
exactly. I have like 3 wallet.dat files but the date doesn’t match, so I’m going to say those aren’t for kmd.

[19-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
just stuff I have on an external hard drive that I’m recovering from.

[19-Oct-18 05:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I realize I need a nano/ ledger going forward. might of cost me a $1k+ lesson now. 😦

[19-Oct-18 05:35 AM] Hermes#6934
What I will do in your position is to try running the native mode of the wallet with each wallet.dat file  that you backed up and see if one holds your funds.  You will just need to replace the wallet.dat file inside of the Komodo folder and do these attempts. It’s better than not trying.

@kyle if ur system based on linux u can recover if ur system on windows u can recover but with a triky think , u need a live usb linux based system ( debian/ubuntu/mint ) a network connection then boot from usb , onece ur live system ready open a terminal  and type sudo su # apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade  .  # apt-get install testdisk  .  run this command # testdisk  . chose ur harddisk partition . you can find more about it  google/youtube  search  tesdisk. it's a 💯  recoverbal data

@Jacobstoon @ActualAdviceBTC @sheos_org @KomodoPlatform #Komodo is severely limited due to transaction fees. Can you convince the masses to pay even $0.01 per action in a dapp? Highly unlikely.

[19-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The masses are already paying several dollars in eth/gas as tx fees for their dapps, why would 0.01 be a problem?

[19-Oct-18 06:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
due to transaction fees? How much is 0.0001 of $1.30?

[19-Oct-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
since when is 0.0001 KMD $0.01?

[19-Oct-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and since when is 0.0001 of the CC chain that the dapp is paid on anywhere close to $0.01

[19-Oct-18 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, he is an EOS guy, never mind, reality doesnt work with delusionals

[19-Oct-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
charge devs a million dollars to have their app running that cant be monetized because as he says users wont pay $0.01 per action

[19-Oct-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is their idea of a good model
