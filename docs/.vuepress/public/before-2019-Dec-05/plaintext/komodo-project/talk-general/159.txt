Is this possible with a deadline?

[16-Dec-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i will pay you from my personal funds if needed

[16-Dec-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but you will need to provide the (expired) privkey

[16-Dec-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be much easier if you can just do the conversion yourself

[16-Dec-18 08:28 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Of course, I would prefer to do it myself as well.

hopefully everyone who has funds in sprout zcaddrs can convert to taddr or sapling by the deadline and we can get to less than 0.01% that needs to be redeemed the hard way (and costing me personally)

[16-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Sure. I'm curious why this is the desired route technically, and what sort of advantage this is over just allowing using the old addresses ongoing, at an upgrade at any point in time. What are benefits to this approach of a deadline?

[16-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
Guaranteeing funds are absolutely not your responsibility.

[16-Dec-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
well it was my decision to technically deprecate the sprout, so I will take the financial responsibility

[16-Dec-18 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
in my technical judgement, having literally half the zksnark code duplicated to provide backward compatiblity for a 100x slower tech, well, it just feels so wrong

[16-Dec-18 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we are talking about the same amount of overall code, used by 0.1% of coin supply, that is 50x to 100x slower

[16-Dec-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
There seems to be some confusion about who needs to convert funds. 99.9% of people (KMD) wont have to do anything at all

[16-Dec-18 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it is only the 0.1% who took the time to create and fund sprout zaddr that need to convert

[16-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
I think it's more the idea of not being able to use your coins in the future that is more unsettling, regardless of it affecting a minority.

[16-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
That seems to violate a core tenant of what many believe is useful and valuable in cryptocurrency.

[16-Dec-18 09:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we are talking about doubling the code to maintain legacy support of the same functionality that is 50x slower and uses more 50x more RAM

[16-Dec-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
now if your funds are in the normal agama 'R' address, then this does not affect you at all

[16-Dec-18 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess if we werent in such a deep bear market and we had more funds available, we could hire dedicated devs to maintain the old codebase... But we have not been getting any donations for doing this. Do you think there will be much donations for the "keep the sprout alive" effort?

[16-Dec-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is an overwhelming support to keep the sprout alive, with the required donations, then I am open to change my decision

@Mark-SmartCash how much will you donate for the cause?

[16-Dec-18 09:08 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
I will donate the balance of my z addresses, on the condition I can keep them. üòÑ

[16-Dec-18 09:09 PM] Mark-SmartCash#4571
I've got to take dog for a walk, thanks for sharing the viewpoints!

[16-Dec-18 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe one way to look at it is that this bear market is causing some projects to scale way down, or even shutdown. For KMD, it caused us to deprecate sprout support

My thoughts....

[17-Dec-18 03:28 AM] smellycouch#3071
@jl777c   I don't think economic climate should be part of an immutability discussion, no special team has been required to maintain z-addresses up until this point.     On the other hand, I don't agree with @Mark-SmartCash  either  üòÉ       This is because I am difficult.

[17-Dec-18 03:29 AM] smellycouch#3071
@Mark-SmartCash ,  I would point you to:

This project is bleeding edge.  Immutability is a goal, not a promise, imho.    If you've invested in that goal, then you share our dream, but we are on a journey here.    If we're going to improve the performance of the blockchain by 50x and make its size vastly more sustainable, remember that this is experimental, and help us out

[17-Dec-18 03:32 AM] smellycouch#3071
I would propose that @jl777c 's decision is the right one, and we should support it.   But if there is a way to turn  2 months into 6 months, that would be cool too.

[17-Dec-18 03:50 AM] bishop#9773
I fail to see how two months to make appropriate conversions is that big of an issue for those that are still utilizing sprout zaddrs

[17-Dec-18 03:52 AM] bishop#9773
Even the most complicated cold storage setup can be planned for in that amount of time

[17-Dec-18 04:20 AM] smellycouch#3071
@bishop  2 months might be ok, but I don't think that is a decision you base on Nano-ledger operation.    To answer that question imho one must go back to why the Z-addresses were created in the first place.    Say you are in a country or state where you are persecuted against.    Internet access is restricted/monitored.     Crypto forbidden.   You've chosen to store wealth in Z-addresses for these reasons.    Now the question is, what is a realistic time to transfer these funds, for you.      I can't answer that.       Overthought, maybe.  But therein would lie the arguement for an extension past 2 months.

[17-Dec-18 04:30 AM] bishop#9773
@smellycouch  Since when does the nano support zaddrs?

[17-Dec-18 04:31 AM] bishop#9773
Further in your restricted/monitored scenario, use a vpn

[17-Dec-18 04:35 AM] bishop#9773
Finally, if it's really THAT bad, two months is ample time to make travel arrangements

[17-Dec-18 04:47 AM] smellycouch#3071
The scenario given would imply restricted or forbidden travel capabilities, unfortunately.  VPNs would typically be out of the question for said individuals and could cost them jail or their life.    Their ability to even find out about the Sapling update would be very limited.   All my wallets are hot, I wouldn't know about ledger, just pointing out that cold storage transfer would not be a decider for the time allowance.

[17-Dec-18 04:55 AM] bishop#9773
The I would question how they acquired crypto to begin with

[17-Dec-18 04:56 AM] bishop#9773
seems wayyy out there to extend a very reasonable timeframe for migration, but I've said my peace.

no

[17-Dec-18 07:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
from what i see i can only generate the Transparent address but  i do think with Saplin upgrade will be easy to  have a shielded address

[17-Dec-18 07:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause bulletproof make that easy and  low cpu usage

[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
a mobile cpu will support   a Saplin transaction

[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
zSPV needs to be made first ...  sapling is still very new, it may take months for this to be avalible.

[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
zspv what s that?

[17-Dec-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
SPV is the backend of electrum wallets, they allow the txs to be created and received on a light wallwet without downloading the entire blockchain

[17-Dec-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for mobile Z tx-s we need a working SPV server with Z support

[17-Dec-18 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think zCash has a few projects looking into this already and I expect when they are ready we will have them very soon afterwards

ohh yeah.. i see ...cause i also have the native kmd agama  on my pc

1/ Let's clear the confusions. You need to understand this is important for anyone having their KMD in Private Addresses. Agama by default doesn't use private address, Exchanges doesn't use private address. A private address is also referred as Z address. https://t.co/w00B...

another article about Bitboost closure, from one of developers

[18-Dec-18 12:12 AM] haha#6652
Why isn't KMD worth more than ZEC? Isn't KMD as private as ZEC but with more security?

[18-Dec-18 12:19 AM] haha#6652
No zec is not as secure as btc

[18-Dec-18 12:20 AM] haha#6652
1. It doesn't have anywhere near BTC's hashrate. 2. Because their ledger is private you can't see if the network if being 51% attacked

[18-Dec-18 12:21 AM] haha#6652
Both of these are solved by KMD since you need to 51% attack btc to 51% attack KMD and you can see attacks taking place on bitcoin

[18-Dec-18 12:23 AM] haha#6652
You can't see ZEC being 51% attacked if you can't see stolen coins.

[18-Dec-18 12:24 AM] haha#6652
Miners just double spend a private ZEC transaction and boom, new coins and no one will know

[18-Dec-18 12:25 AM] haha#6652
Yes it does, it's how you create new coins

[18-Dec-18 12:26 AM] haha#6652
A double spend attack leaves the attacker with more coins than they started with

[18-Dec-18 12:26 AM] haha#6652
= more money

[18-Dec-18 12:27 AM] haha#6652
You just 51% attack till the exchange allows you to deposit

[18-Dec-18 12:28 AM] haha#6652
On ZEC the exchange will not realize it's  51% attack

[18-Dec-18 12:28 AM] haha#6652
If the total supply of a coin can't be proven and you 51% attack then send your money to exchanges

[18-Dec-18 12:29 AM] haha#6652
Actually when you stop 51% attacking, do the coins you double spended disappear? @Deleted User

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] haha#6652
what are you talking about?

[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] haha#6652
Okay lets restart since i think I'm confused. If I 51% attack ZEC and send new ZECs to exchanges to sell

[18-Dec-18 12:33 AM] haha#6652
is there a way of telling ZEC was 51% attacked

[18-Dec-18 12:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
When a 51 occurs the first transaction is invalidated no new coins are created

[18-Dec-18 12:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
He just gets the coins he originally sent to the exchange back

[18-Dec-18 12:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because in his version of the chain  it didn't happen

[18-Dec-18 12:34 AM] haha#6652
So the exchange will be able to tell when their amount of ZEC differs from the amount deposited

[18-Dec-18 12:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes and by then the hacker made off with the BTC

[18-Dec-18 12:35 AM] haha#6652
What if it's a dex?

[18-Dec-18 12:35 AM] haha#6652
I'm guessing the dex will just be killed off or something right?

[18-Dec-18 12:35 AM] haha#6652
Since there'd be no way for users to withdraw coins in that case

[18-Dec-18 12:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pretty much ,  not sure if it's been done because a ) dexs have low liquidityand b) typically on some form of PoS chain

[18-Dec-18 12:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Eth dex has eth hash protecting it
