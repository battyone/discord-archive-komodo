This is a temporary channel to get feedback from our community. We got new community guidelines and we are defining a good moderation policy that makes everyone happy.

We are also thinking if there's any way to reduce the amount of channels. Probably not :abusedsmily: 

Drop your feedback & ideas here

I noticed that most of conversations on #talk-trading  are not related to trading. I found no channel in such state

[24-Sep-19 05:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
not that different to a real life trading floor though

[24-Sep-19 05:16 PM] phm87#7395
Yes but I know more serious trading communities where such msgs can be deleted. Crypto funds and investors. Anyway, I won't fight to fix this : I learn trading stuff elsewhere and not on kmd discord

[24-Sep-19 05:17 PM] phm87#7395
Guys such as siu and markus can help ppl (to see if a TA is valid or invalidated). They are helping ppl and teaching. But these msgs are lost in all unrelated msgs

[24-Sep-19 05:18 PM] phm87#7395
In the traders community I am talking about, they have 2 trading channels: talk-crypto and TA. TA should contain only TA

[24-Sep-19 05:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
the only solution is.... more channels :troll:

[24-Sep-19 05:18 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[24-Sep-19 05:19 PM] phm87#7395
Or maybe push ppl in offtopic or general or use another random channel to discuss

[24-Sep-19 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Technical trading <> Trading general

[24-Sep-19 05:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
could be an option for two trading chans

[24-Sep-19 05:19 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[24-Sep-19 05:19 PM] phm87#7395
I vote for 1200 new channels

[24-Sep-19 05:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
where trading general can be the loosely moderated trading channel that has existed since the slack times etc

[24-Sep-19 05:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and trading technical where you can talk fib and EMA levels :p

[24-Sep-19 05:20 PM] phm87#7395
I read a suggestion to have a bot trading channel for dev who trade with bots

[24-Sep-19 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
there was one, nobody used it i think

[24-Sep-19 05:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
#dev-tradebots <- #dev-marketmaker

[24-Sep-19 05:23 PM] jorian#4555
the chat style in #talk-trading is probably a remnant of the Slack era, where the trading channel there was a place to discuss a lot more than just trading

[24-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
also #general in Slack was a nice place to discuss all general things SuperNET / komodo

[24-Sep-19 05:24 PM] jorian#4555
can't really describe why that is

[24-Sep-19 05:27 PM] xeonrider#3120
I find it quite hostile in trading not sure what is going on there but it surely isnt about trading

[24-Sep-19 05:28 PM] xeonrider#3120
and... way too many channels

[24-Sep-19 05:30 PM] Audo#5667
thanks for your feedback. Much appreciated

[24-Sep-19 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yous say "more channels", I say:

guyse am i the only one who thinks we have too many chats in this discord? maybe it would be nice to have seperate discords for some branches and only keep the top topics here, maybe link the subchannels here to an outsourced discord? idk, but scrolling through the channels is getting somehow overwhelming, even tho it is neatly structured, for me its getting bin hard to overlook the topics im intrested in.

[24-Sep-19 05:35 PM] Audo#5667
do the channels at the very bottom get in way too? Like for example we have tons of ecosystem project channels.

[24-Sep-19 05:39 PM] groundhog#0062
not necessarily but its bit hard to over look all this, especially for new members i think

[24-Sep-19 05:40 PM] groundhog#0062
imagine landing here for the first time...

[24-Sep-19 05:40 PM] groundhog#0062
just sayin tho

[24-Sep-19 05:40 PM] groundhog#0062
😉

[24-Sep-19 05:44 PM] xeonrider#3120
@Audo there are archived ones. Unless there is an option now in discord to mute every channel

[24-Sep-19 05:45 PM] xeonrider#3120
@groundhog you are right, but than again Komodo tech isnt really easy for someone new

[24-Sep-19 05:45 PM] xeonrider#3120
unless you just want to fire up a blockchain

[24-Sep-19 05:47 PM] xeonrider#3120
I prefer moderation vs lesser channels

[24-Sep-19 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`do the channels at the very bottom get in way too? Like for example we have tons of ecosystem project channels.`
no, it's all the other crap that gets in the way of getting to *them*

{Reactions}
💯 

[24-Sep-19 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, 2 ecosystem headers would be nice
maybe "Ecosystem Projects" for those that do live here and "Ecosystem Extensions" (or something along that line) for those that are here and somewhere else?

[24-Sep-19 06:36 PM] groundhog#0062
@xeonrider but i think we also want to grow the community. some ppl just want to invest and see the developement and news, others may start their own project at somepoint. maybe dev topics and general topics could be separated, idk, komodo is developing so quickly its hard to follow up unless the surrounding structure gets updated aswell to make it easy for newbs to find an entrance point and satisfying userexperience. it takes couple hours to overview the project to someone new, maybe that could be a good starting point.

[24-Sep-19 06:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`to make it easy for newbs to find an entrance point`
Having watched all the growth from just a handful of channels when we moved over here, I've often wondered the challenge level of coming here new

[24-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
the entrance point is not the issue. You simply don't really get ahead without being at the mercy of people who might know something. I just like being able to do the basics on my own instead of throwing myself at the mercy of other people who "might" be in a good mood to help out or get referred to rtfm or "go slowly".

[24-Sep-19 06:50 PM] xeonrider#3120
just my 2 cents

[24-Sep-19 06:56 PM] groundhog#0062
growing the community is the issue as i see it, from ethusiast and businessrelated pov, but the question is who is the targeting group and how to attract them. cus the tech is good imo.

[25-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Mixic#3188
Well done, guys! Glad to see that Komodo always thinks about his community 🙂 👍

[25-Sep-19 02:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
I agree with the move to raise the general quality of what gets posted on this discord. It also seems like an inordinate amount of posts are just people complaining. Constructive criticism ie "I think X is a little weak, we should try Y to make X better" is a lot better than "kmd is a total shitcoin and your team sucks". People often just come in here to troll everyone and there should be some threshold where people who are being dicks will be muted or kicked, even temporarily. No one needs it. It just lowers morale. This is an open project, but that doesn't mean that anyone should be able to come here and spread their psychic waste because they're frustrated.

[25-Sep-19 07:33 AM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
Good initiative !! What I would like Komodo to promote as a multifunctional platform for upcoming projects. Also to point out already existing ERC-20 projects on the clear advantages of komodo and also to offer guidance including supporters for a change (Chainzilla ...). A graphic representation would set the ball rolling and komodo would be in the minds of devs and investors.

Ecosystem needs a #mediation channel to help prevent flame wars. Quarantine the posts and the ones arguing to only this channel till disputes solved, utilize a mediator. Find some common ground, shake hands, act like adults.

when I used to run a chat back in the GPRS WAP days we had a room called "Prison" people who got sent to prison could not come out until they "did their time" but in the prison, they could rant without rules, and only "inmates" were allowed in that room. 
It worked really well, but I don't know if this is possible on Discord unless you manually assign a "prisoner" role to said people and then manually remove it.

[26-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Oszy#5734
we had it coded, maybe a discord bot can manage this the same way, so after X minutes it removes the role, and the role would make the person only able to see / write in that single room

☝🏽 

[26-Sep-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if (and I realize this is a really radical idea) people saw the name of someone they didn't like and just choose to not read the words that follow that name....

[26-Sep-19 09:24 PM] Oszy#5734
It's not about who you like but what they write, and for that you have to read what they wrote 😛 
Blocking someone hides the messages too, but that doesn't stop them flooding the channel with irrelevant or offensive chat.

[26-Sep-19 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`It's not about who you like but what they write`
OK, I thought you were referring to what happened today
_will butt out now_

[26-Sep-19 09:25 PM] Oszy#5734
Don't know about what happened today

[26-Sep-19 09:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw: "offensive chat" is an entirely subjective concept open to much individual interpretation 🤷🏽

[26-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Oszy#5734
of course

[27-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Audo#5667
haha, interesting idea @Oszy 

That would be possible actually, but maybe the current solution is a bit better though.

Right now mods can 'timeout' people for x number of minutes, making them unable to chat (but they can read).

[27-Sep-19 10:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
increase their rage levels

[28-Sep-19 03:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
In my part of the world saying wtf is not ban worthy. It's more of a colloquial expression. Calling some one mean names such as @#$&, or a string of demeaning curse words is however ban worthy.

[28-Sep-19 03:17 PM] joe2x4#5987
STFU is even a popular Max keiser saying.

[28-Sep-19 03:22 PM] Audo#5667
The decision was made after reading the message history. We won't be banning people too easily in general, but there have been a number of people who have caused problems and we take a more strict line now to set a proper moderation standard.

Many people work hard to build up this project, and we don't need people here who never contribute to the conversation but only cause problems.

[28-Sep-19 03:27 PM] joe2x4#5987
Agree. I appreciate the case by case common sense approach and explanation of actions taken.

[28-Sep-19 03:29 PM] joe2x4#5987
Hopefully though, a cool down time out ban is also implemented as sanity is often governed by external forces and most times rest and food are the cure.

[28-Sep-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a "cool down time" tends to just make someone that's mad sit and write and entire text wall instead of being in context (in my experience)

[28-Sep-19 07:05 PM] Caglio#3337
He was a big kmd promoter who got banned for "foul" language 😦

[28-Sep-19 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I missed most of what happened with that, but it kinda says something about the complaint being that that channel is **more** offensive now than when I was there :troll_lol:

[29-Sep-19 05:59 PM] Audo#5667 (pinned)
If someone is banned or muted they can fill a form and make an appeal to the Komodo community's moderators. This way there is always a way back for those who really want to be part of our community.

The form: https://forms.monday.com/forms/5fd66a8253ca0111449a26807c88a113

Congratulations and thank you for cleaning up the discord.  Seems like the disrespectful culture was really down to a handful of people who are revealing by their continued absences that they were always more interested in disruption than in komodo

@Audo 
I'm not sure how to better explain it, but you're still missing my point.
that you said x was *also* the reason, in some channel that the person will likely never go into, doesn't change what he can screenshot what the bot told him
```
YAGPDB.xyzBOT 10/31/2019
Komodo: You have been :mute:Muted (Expires after: 10 minutes)
Reason: repeating complaints atomicdex everywhere```
makes for a __horrible__ screenshot when it comes to PR and the dude telling everyone that will listen that he got mute just because he was confused and couldn't get help
no one outside of this discord is going to see that you said something in addition to that in a given team channel

[31-Oct-19 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
From a PR stance, the "reason" used needs to be something that "you don't know the whole story" doesn't need to be said, imo

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] Audo#5667
Moderating is not easy, let's just show some support to our mods that try to help.

If you mean that @farl should also have added that the guy called a team member a scammer then yes, that would have been a good addition to the reason.

[31-Oct-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, that was what I was getting at

[31-Oct-19 01:35 PM] Audo#5667
ok, it's good input, thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 .

@Community Moderator let's type out the 'reason' carefully from now on as that is what most of the community sees. Otherwise people might be alarmed that we mute or warn people too easily.

[31-Oct-19 01:38 PM] Audo#5667
some guy who was frustrated got 10 min mute, spammed channels and called SirSeven a scammer

[31-Oct-19 01:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Where was that?

[31-Oct-19 01:39 PM] Audo#5667
probably on the atomicdex channel

Didn't see it.  Had stuff going on in Labs too, so maybe mis-timing.
