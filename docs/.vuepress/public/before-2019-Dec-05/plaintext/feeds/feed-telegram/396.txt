[telegram] <Seko1900> Because it has nothing to do with Komodo? (re @CaptainCooked420: I don't understand the purpose of your comment if you're not interested just don't say anything, why spread fud about a product you're obviously not informed on?)

[16-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CaptainCooked420> People were talking about hardware solutions and i mentioned Bitfi, I don't see how what I've said is any less relavent then posts like "why dump" or "when moon"

[16-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko1900> It's always an enrichment. The more exchanges and the more wallets that support KMD, the better. If someone wants to implement Komodo, he can contact the team directly. (re @CaptainCooked420: People were talking about hardware solutions and i mentioned Bitfi, I don't see how what I've said is any less relavent then posts like "why dump" or "when moon")

[16-Sep-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko1900> Not Komodo has to support the hardware wallets, but the wallets have to support Komodo. This is how it works technically. But why is Komodo not supported by other wallets? What do you think?

[16-Sep-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CaptainCooked420> It goes both ways, coins can reach out to wallets and wallets can reach out to coins it's usually a win win

[16-Sep-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CaptainCooked420> Though in the case of KMD Bitfi could add them whenever they'd like and I'm sure they will in the future

[16-Sep-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko1900> I wish everyone who sells a shovel every success. But meanwhile many people want that. Komodo is always interested in partnerships, but at the moment there are many shovels. It has to fit and it has to be requested.

[16-Sep-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko1900> Maybe both will come together in the future, but at the moment there are other constructions. And maybe AtomicDEX will lead to partnerships with hardware wallets.

[16-Sep-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Umitkara48> Hmmm ok.

[16-Sep-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> @Ggokhangark that website is absolutely not a scam, unfortunately KMD investors only see fud where there are only facts and blockchain proofs and data. Minimizing it is just a strategy.

[16-Sep-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> a reason I can t post here ?

[16-Sep-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You can post.

[16-Sep-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> ah seems ok. So, @Ggokhangark the website is absolutely not a scam. It s just one year crying for KMD to fix their mistakes and stop shady stuff. All is just public on the blockchain, and on notarystats.info.
It s far more easier and a good strategy to pretend it s not true, unfortunately the blockchain can t be manipulated... Investors are warned now. "This guy" was 4th world notary in season 2. Just base on facts, and not people pretending anything, and you ll understand.

[16-Sep-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> @Ggokhangark nope, not a scam at all, just proofs of what happened during a year, mostly based on blockchain stuff that can t be faked

[telegram] <Dwydco> @Ggokhangar nope, not a scam at all, just proofs of what happened during a year, mostly based on blockchain stuff that can t be faked

[telegram] <Dwydco> gokhangark nope, not a scam at all, just proofs of what happened during a year, mostly based on blockchain stuff that can t be faked. It s far more easier to say fud or scam than looking at facts and blockchain data. All is there, on explorers and on notarystats.info.
Please just look at the blockchain. I just hope investors are aware that it s the reality, emotions aside.

[16-Sep-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> would be happy to understand if that s because message too long, tagging or whatever, but no, I can t post
