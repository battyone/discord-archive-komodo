[telegram] <Hermes08> Your funds are not in the wallet as in a program your funds are in the blockchain . The wallet access the block chain and you get to see the funds because you have the private keys or seed for an specific address . As long as you have the private keys or seed for that specific address you will be able to manage your funds.
