[telegram] <Regnar> Stop posting for people to PM you to make "escrow trades" that's scammy. Put the escrow trade up on Barterlly and let it fill, or send the link to it. (re @alex_zaid: If you wana buy ping me)

[29-May-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Thanks for reporting him! (re @freerider101: he tried to use a admin as an escrow by just creating a new user in telegram with that name....)

[29-May-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Remember everyone! Do NOT do "escrow" trades through telegram, that's how you get scammed. Best bet is to use Barterlly, if someone says they will trade via escrow, post a trade (it can even be private) and send them the link to the trade, or only accept trades via Barterlly links. Komodo Admins will NOT personally escrow your funds.

[29-May-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> Maybe in the future that could be considered a lot. Never know. (re @k: This time it looks very serious and i only have 2k of kmd, thats basically nothing)
