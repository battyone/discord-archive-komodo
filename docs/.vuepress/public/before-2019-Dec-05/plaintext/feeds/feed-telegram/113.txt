Komodo shows a short-term floor.  We would wait for more confirmation as the potential for lower levels still exists!

I am from Vietnam. One thing I dont understand, as i know, Chinese gov dont allow crypto like btc, why they are ranking the cryptocurrency ?

[23-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> There is a  common misunderstanding that the Chinese government is banning crypto

[23-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It's the opposite. I've met people who are in charge of educating the Chinese government on new blockchain technologies. They are not banning crypto, they want to control as much as possible.

[telegram] <Jamlite> Can any fall be built on Komodo?

[23-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> And how does Komodo compare to the cryptos that are building infinite scaling solutions?

[23-Aug-18 02:38 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Komodo already has an infinite scaling solution üòÉ

[23-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> This is a quite large area to cover but theoretically speaking i believe Komodo is infinitely scalable through side chain use and probably soon the first to demonstrate this (1 mil tps/s target). To answer your question properly you need to specify the cryptos in question, then it would be possible to compare how far away are they from the target. (re @Jamlite: And how does Komodo compare to the cryptos that are building infinite scaling solutions?)

[23-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> Such as elastos and soon cardando (re @Keytothegate: This is a quite large area to cover but theoretically speaking i believe Komodo is infinitely scalable through side chain use and probably soon the first to demonstrate this (1 mil tps/s target).

[23-Aug-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> Elastos looks a lot more ready for this than Cardano

[23-Aug-18 02:46 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
The founder behind Cardano is someone who takes a lot of time before he releases something to get everything in place. Don't expect anything from that coin soon.

[23-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I am invested in Ela but cannot really comment on their solution as I haven't really studied it (should have but time..). Cardano is a long, rather respectable project that I believe is still long way from achieving this. There are other interesting methods (IOTA tangle, HPB's hardware accelerator and guess Achain could use similar type of side chain approach as Komodo) but to compare em.. all are behind Komodo (re @Jamlite: Such as elastos and soon cardando)

[telegram] <realStunt101> Jumblr jumbles your coins

[23-Aug-18 07:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
JUMBLR is designed to hide z-transactions even better. So should be pretty hard to trace

[23-Aug-18 07:49 PM] xRobeSx#5136
you can do z-transactions without JUMBLR as well, but JUMBLR mixes your coins in batches making it harder to trace inputs to outputs
