[telegram] <Louisbap> If i place my kmd in agama wallet do i get rewards? (re @Mdoubleu: No. He is talking about the return you get for placing your KMD in the Agama wallet)

[telegram] <Acura360> Want to sell (re @Umitkara48: Wts?)

[30-Nov-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mdoubleu> Yes.  You get more KMD. You just need to claim the KMD that is generated in your wallet from storing it there once a month (re @Louisbap: If i place my kmd in agama wallet do i get rewards?)

[30-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Louisbap> Cool
 I will do it asap binance.let me withdrawn. Any prevision? (re @Mdoubleu: Yes.  You get more KMD. You just need to claim the KMD that is generated in your wallet from storing it there once a month)

[telegram] <Mdoubleu> Binance might be stopping deposits and withdrawal's soon for huge upgrade in December. (re @Louisbap: Cool

[30-Nov-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mdoubleu> Like with any wallet make sure you have private keys saved offline. With the wallet you can use the lite mode which enables you to access your address without synching and downloading the whole chain. Komodo has a tutorial on their site. (re @Louisbap: Cool
 I will do it asap binance.let me withdrawn. Any prevision?)

[telegram] <Giotti96> One question : Komodo aim to be a currency right ? Let's suppose that I buy 10 Komodo for 10 dollar today. And one product worth 10 dollar on Amazon. After one month 1 kmd worth 2 dollar and Amazon redefine the price of that product to 5 kmd( 5 x 2 dollar= 10 dollar ). The person that have bought 10 kmd one month ago could take two product for 10 dollars because he bought kmd when 1kmd= 1 dollar. The person that buy kmd now ( 1kmd= 2 dollar) could purchase only one product with ten dollars .
