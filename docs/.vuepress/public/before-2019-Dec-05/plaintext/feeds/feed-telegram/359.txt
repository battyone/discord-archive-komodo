[telegram] <kracken> where did they get the 11% roi from? (re @LuckyBTC: No. 5.1% is max yearly.)

[16-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jun-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <fulltilts> Really, I havenâ€™t received any confirmations or communication. (re @Cabey: Yes, all of the undisputed claims have been processed)

[telegram] <LuckyBTC> You don't have to stake, just have balance above 10 KMD to claim rewards (re @blockchainbriann: What are the metrics for staking?)

[16-Jun-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TomKron> u can stake min 10KMD in the wallet and u should claim them every Year.

[16-Jun-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <k> Keep thinking (re @TomKron: i think around 500k usd)

[16-Jun-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TomKron> it should be between 500k and 1 million cuz of the halvening every 3 years

[16-Jun-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> funny question ... imagine a case in which due to vulnerability in Microsoft Windows you will lose your bank deposit. and answer, will Microsoft compensate your loss? or will your bank compensate it? answer is no. but Komodo saved our funds ... and return it. and that's great!

[16-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> mean, sadly that it happened (hack), but great that all is ok now and funds are safe.

[16-Jun-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
miguelborges99, you had 28.8 KMD swept, the automated code returned 28 KMD. if you feel so stolen from due to the 0.8 KMD, maybe others will feel your pain and donate to you to make up for this. I am already out of pocket 500,000 KMD so I dont have any more to give

[16-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> I've used the official komodo wallet, it was supposed to be audited and secure.

[16-Jun-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you are free to make a giant big deal over the 0.8 KMD

[16-Jun-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Seriously?
Give me your kmd adress - i will send you the 0.8kmd that you are missing - and then please stop crying here (re @miguelborges99: I've used the official komodo wallet, it was supposed to be audited and secure.)

[16-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
actually if you send only 0.8 he will probably complain as it was actually 0.82856476, so he will whine about missing 0.0285 KMD

[16-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> good thing that komodo team auditing their software and saved our funds.

[16-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OneGuyFromInternet> @miguelborges99 if no audit, you probably will lose your funds ... but as i'm understand all your funds except 0.8 KMD comes back, right?

[16-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <miguelborges99> sorry guys... no need to humiliate me because of 0.8 kmd... it was good for komodo to return all the funds to all holders

0.82856476 is missing

[16-Jun-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
some users had a bit more, but i coded the logic in the heat of the moment trying to save 8 million KMD
