[telegram] <torsten1> Binance never really did any advertising. But they started listing coins no one had, especially NEO back then in those 2-3 months when NEO was the hype of the time. And they provided impeccable customer service from day 1 when you had to wait 2 weeks to get a reply from Poloniex support

[telegram] <torsten1> Ah you mean competitions

[24-Oct-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> That is marketing

[24-Oct-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yea, AtomicDEX for sure will do competitions

[24-Oct-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Marketing for sure, but you said tele ads and NYC billboards :D

[24-Oct-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I agree, competitions are helpful

[24-Oct-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Do you know how much money Komodo raised? $2m. And probably built 5x as much stuff as EOS from their $4bn :)

[24-Oct-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Yes but no one knows

[24-Oct-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Your 100% right eos is nothing

[24-Oct-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> And we have done more... but who cares if we are a forgotten name

[24-Oct-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> I don‚Äôt think marketing is all that either

[24-Oct-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> We need a balance

[24-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Like tron all marketing

[24-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Like for the beta test of atomic dex

[24-Oct-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Should of been a trading competition

[24-Oct-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I hear you, man. I really do. Komodo should be louder and should do better marketing ‚Äî agreed 100%. But look at the other side. Komodo is a small project, with a very modest budget. We build like madmen. We do not, had not and never will do ads on NYC billboards because we don't have the budget. But no one at Komodo owns a Lambo either. This is a super tech-focused and extremely frugal operation. We are here for the long game.

[24-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <torsten1> yes, for sure

[24-Oct-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> And it could be too late

[24-Oct-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Oct-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Oct-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> 100% agree. (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: You're goddamn right. 100%)

[24-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The thing is most competitions have prizes. And those prizes are donated by community members, so they want to make sure there is a real value gained from the competition. As a potential donor I wouldn't want a competition until it's out of beta, any critical bugs are fixed, and a stress test is done. When we know we can handle a full scale trading competition on the DEX, itll be a good time for it. Until then, it is in beta. (re @Bar_Harbor: Should of been a trading competition)

[24-Oct-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> This, 1000%. Polo literally was crashing for 99% of the traders and had 25% price differences between exchanges because their engines crashed for everyone except a few people. Those few people dumped the polo markets, liquidating a shit ton of polo positions and basically robbed everyone. 
It was absolute chaos. Polo had open support tickets for MONTHS from people who tried to remove open orders but couldn't, and got their shit sold off. Then Polo removed the Trollbox, basically the one Avenue to talk to admin in real time, and they have never recovered (re @torsten1: Binance never really did any advertising. But they started listing coins no one had, especially NEO back then in those 2-3 months when NEO was the hype of the time. And they provided impeccable customer service from day 1 when you had to wait 2 weeks to get a reply from Poloniex support)

[telegram] <Regnar> We're a DEX, the beauty is we can list all the small coins on the backend engine, Chainswap, Hyperdex, AtomicAPI for little to no cost (they may have revised their pricing) and the AtomicDEX mobile for a fee. We should be scooping up tons of smaller projects
