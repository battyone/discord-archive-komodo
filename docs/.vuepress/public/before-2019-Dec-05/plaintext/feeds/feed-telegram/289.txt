[telegram] <Regnar> The whole Komodo ecosystem is this way, almost all Komodo asset chains are runtime forks with Komodo, so updates and new features on Komodo can be pushed to different asset chains, and vice versa. 
Verus solved the nothing at stake problem and actually pushed their custom mining algorithm back to Komodo, which can now pass that to new asset chains that want it. Also Pirate, Komodo, and Verus, as well as over 40 other blockchains in Komodo updated to Sapling addresses all at once. These are huge benefits to building in the Komodo ecosystem (re @jason_1986: Awesome! Makes me more comfortable investing knowing there are strong links with Komodo team! :D)

[telegram] <yorklab> You are already seeing projects coming over from ETH.

[07-May-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is the most private coin out there, VRSC is one of the most technically advanced. It seems you like all the "useful" ERC20 tokens much more. if KMD rose in price 100x, then it too would get much more widely distributed. I think you are comparing aspects of the #2 coin against what is currently #50, of course the #2 coin will have some advantages, otherwise it wouldnt be #2. Anyway, the KMD/ETH price is more than doubled over the last year, so even relatively speaking pricewise, KMD is doing better. There is just a lot more upside to KMD than to ETH

[07-May-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you really believe that ETH marketcap of 150x KMD is sustainable for ETH and ETH will increase it, then you need to dump KMD and buy ETH

[07-May-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to be that zcash had a much higher multiple of KMD, but KMD is now one third ZEC marketcap and it continues to increase against ZEC.

[telegram] <Seppe> Why i should invest on Pirate and VRSC? The market Is plenty of coins line these Two. Otherwise, on ethereum are developing Dapps with actual real use (Maker, Kyber, Augur, 
And many other). (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> PIRATE is the most private coin out there, VRSC is one of the most technically advanced. It seems you like all the "useful" ERC20 tokens much more. if KMD rose in price 100x, then it too would get much more widely distributed. I think you are comparing aspects of the #2 coin against what is currently #50, of course the #2 coin will have some advantages, otherwise it wouldnt be #2. Anyway, the KMD/ETH price is more than doubled over the last year, so even relatively speaking pricewise, KMD is doing better. There is just a lot more upside to KMD than to ETH)

just sell the KMD then, go all in to ETH

[07-May-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
you raised some points, I answered each of them. you then ignore it and twist things around, clearly you have your mind made up

[07-May-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mc_crypto> ok, so let's just ignore obviously problems just becuase it isn't an issue "right now," kinda like landfill, or global warming, right?
So, from the logic you've provided, you're telling me you don't mind have to pay fees every time you want to interact with the chain? even to send messages, or to claim?.....interesting. (re @Seppe: Gas and congestion aren't an issue right now. By the time that this Will be an issue, ethereum team Will deliver solutions)

[telegram] <mc_crypto> "largely" adopted‚Äî>forseeable profits
mind explaining the function above? (re @Seppe: As an investor, i put my money where i see my profit. In Ethereum i see an ecosystem largely adopted. On Komodo i see a formidable software with no spread an adoption)

[telegram] <crypto_blackbeard> It's an issiue with binance then (re @Donnie: I‚Äôve send KMD from binance to my ledger but the status is still prossesing and its already about 2 hours ago ?)

[07-May-19 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mc_crypto> here, I'll be it easier:
f("largely" adopted) = forseeable profits
f(x) = ? (re @mc_crypto: "largely" adopted‚Äî>forseeable profits
mind explaining the function above?)

[07-May-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mc_crypto> and I'm pushing a few more (re @yorklab: You are already seeing projects coming over from ETH.)

[07-May-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sagacity25> lol (re @mc_crypto: here, I'll be it easier:
f("largely" adopted) = forseeable profits
f(x) = ?)

[07-May-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> The team Is working on these problems. Once they Will solve these issues, there Will be no reason to build on Komodo (re @mc_crypto: ok, so let's just ignore obviously problems just becuase it isn't an issue "right now," kinda like landfill, or global warming, right?

[telegram] <mc_crypto> Ya, Binance is notorious for hour-long withdrawals. BTC takes at least an hour for me usually. try checking your email for a auth action (re @Donnie: I‚Äôve send KMD from binance to my ledger but the status is still prossesing and its already about 2 hours ago ?)

[07-May-19 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kremer (n k)> Binance takes abt 2 hrs for kmd

[07-May-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Werxadler> For me it took never longer than 5 minutes (re @kremer (n k): Binance takes abt 2 hrs for kmd)
