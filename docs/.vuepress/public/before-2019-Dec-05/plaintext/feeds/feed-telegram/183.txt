[01-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Incorrect ,  it's a commodity currency.  Komodo does have a stable value, 1 KMD is equal to one day worth of notarization on one chain. (re @Giotti96: Otherwise we can't call it currency)

[01-Dec-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> And so the aim of Komodo is not to replace dollar or any other Fiat (re @polycryptoblog: Incorrect ,  it's a commodity currency.  Komodo does have a stable value, 1 KMD is equal to one day worth of notarization on one chain.)

[01-Dec-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Correct  it will work in tandem with traditional currencies

[01-Dec-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> And in your opinion this is the objective also of Bitcoin or Bitcoin aims to be a currency (re @polycryptoblog: Correct  it will work in tandem with traditional currencies)

[01-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Giotti96> ?

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> I think bitcoin tried to be a currency but its real strength is in data security.  Notarization is an example in practice of working in tandem with credit monies.  If a company or person wants to run a blockchain for some purpose and wants that chain to be secure when mass hashrate for the chain is impractical they will need Komodo to do so.  In this way the company's primary currency works in tandem with Komodo ,  they conduct business in fiat  which is used to purchase Komodo for their ends,  that purchase provides liquidity against that fiat pair.    More alternative forms of money are being tied to the Komodo ecosystem as well,  example is Marmara which is using a Komodo assetchain as a ledger for post-dated cheques in Turkey.   Just as described above with the company example, Marmara will be using a chain that requires notarization to obtain the cost of that notarization they will have to exchange something for Komodo presumably this will be in the form of a marmara coin liquidity source

[01-Dec-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Komodo has all 4 classical functions of money 1) Store of Value ( via scarcity and 5% rewards ) 2) Medium of Exchange ( blockchain properties in general ) 3) Unit of Account ( value of Komodo tied to quantitative amount of utility via notarization and 4) Standard of Deferred Payment ( via 0confirm deposits for use in BarterDEX )

[telegram] <Acura360> Important note to all **Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean)** users according to new features coming on December 15 - https://komodoplatform.com/upgrade-guide-dec-15/ . As we are all know coming update brings a lot of new features, such as sapling, VerusHash algorithm and others. This is a massive update that includes changes to over 500 different source files and adding new dependencies. Komodo-Qt will follow original komodod branch and will updated too as soon as possible, but this hard work unfortunatelly will not be finished to 15 Dec (!), in this way all komodo-qt users should temporarily switch to use original komodo daemon (komodod) or Agama, until update for komodo-qt will be released. All your funds are safe, just backup `wallet.dat` and continue to use your `wallet.dat` from Komodo-Qt with komodod or Agama, or export your privkeys from Komodo-Qt using `z_exportwallet` and import them into komodod with `z_importwallet`. 
We will keep you informed about current state of Komodo-Qt and coming updates, but keep in mind that current version of Komodo-Qt will be incompatible with new changes after sapling is activated, so, you should temporary stop using it and switch to other wallet.

There is no chain-split. Only one chain will remain as mainchain and will be notarized by Notary Nodes. Exchanges, pools and service providers just need to update their node (komodo daemon) and start using it before 15 December 2018. We will contact them once code is ready for master branch.

[02-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> Please don't let the word "HardFork" irritate you. It is not a fork from which two coins spring.  It's just an update. All you have to do is update Agama. More information will follow in the next days.
The Exchanges all get the daemon and do the same, they update their wallets.
