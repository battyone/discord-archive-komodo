[16-Mar-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Haha agreed. The only thing that slightly redeems the possibility of it being a scam is the monthly cost, atm fee, and international fees. Those are all much higher than normal, which to me indicates it is the price for anonymity... but I think @ieatfeds should step up for all of us and try it :P (re @David: it smells like a scam from Saturn)

that green volume bar on weekly answers it all i guess
they have some things lined up as well, keep accumulating the dips and target 4700 for now, if the ih&s comes in play, i think we can see 8000 after that
