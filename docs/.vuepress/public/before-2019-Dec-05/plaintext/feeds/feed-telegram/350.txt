[09-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
about 20% have received refunds, but weighed to the smaller ones so only about $1 mil worth is returned. we are ahead of the June 15th schedule by almost a week. for those that did not receive refunds yet, make sure to follow the instructions. any address with any controversy has not been processed yet. i see a lot of people made many claims for the same address and that triggered a disputed flag, ie. delayed
all clean refunds for less than 7777 KMD has been processed
there will be daily batches
make sure the dust payment sent to your old address has 'S' in the explorer for your old address. if not, that means you did not send it to the new address. send all funds to the new address to solve this
if you did not get the early refund, that means you missed the cutoff yesterday, or made multiple claims or your address is contested or it is over 7777 KMD
plz do not be making DM asking about these things. it is always the same answer.

[09-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Vulnerabilities occur and unfortunately they are some times exploited by bad actors. However this is true of any piece of software.

[09-Jun-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
