[telegram] <PTYX11> 5% is more than enough given that it's part of the yearly inflation.

[07-Oct-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That would make inflation per year over 10%... better to have modest increase in coins that's capped in the future and have value increase in individual coins (and therefore your holdings) than increase in the number of your coins but decrease in value... (re @krisninakos: nope 30 but 10% is enough good for such a coin with power)

Question in Telegram:
Hi, how many DAPPs does Komod has ?

[16-Oct-18 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant track all the usages of the various CC, each creates their own set of rpc calls and basically any script that uses these rpc calls become dapps

[16-Oct-18 04:50 AM] jl777c#5810
internally oracles CC is popular and already several interesting ideas are being worked on, but as an open source system, we cant 100% know what all the things everyone is doing

[telegram] <sryvnna> Coins never have been designed to achieve high sustained profitability. If the new coins have supporters, they will go straight ahead when they go to the market. and makes the most profit on the first rise, for example btc. BTC was much more valued when it took place in the first market and now it is always falling. so investors are investing in a coin to produce new coin.
