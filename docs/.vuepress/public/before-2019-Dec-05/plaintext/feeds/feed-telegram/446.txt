so there is proof that somebody accumulated a significant amount of KMD, a chinese investment firm that announced that they accumulated a significant amount of KMD, price premium at chinese exchanges, and near alltime high OBV even after the price is corrected on lower volumes

[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Aight fair enough. This is crypto after all. Cant hurt to ask questions and be skeptical. If wallets werent disabled while this was going on, then there wouldnt be anything to question.

[21-Nov-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
also please note i am not saying that deposits being closed has no effect, i am saying that is just one factor

[21-Nov-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
wallets got disabled after the price move already started

[21-Nov-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
my estimate is that if wallets were open the entire time, we would have still had the majority of this price move. probably to 11k peak instead of 12.8k peak, but it is very hard to tell as there is little resistance once we get past 10k and like i have been saying there is 10 million+ KMD on binance, so there is plenty of KMD that could have been sold, and indeed the down cycle started before the wallets reopened

[21-Nov-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810

[21-Nov-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> I agree this looks like normal price action for any given alt in 2018 or 2018. 
Being skeptical of pumps like this is an easy way to increase your stack in preparation for the real pumps in 202X when the tech is presentable to retail.
By skeptical I don't mean worries about manipulation or conspiracies. I hope epidemic managed a few nice trades even locked from binance.

[21-Nov-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
our chinese community building just started, so we indeed expect that we will get more and more happening on that front, along with all the other things that are going on.

[21-Nov-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
since komodo has essentially been endorsed by china govt for over a year with their ccid lists, it is not so surprising that as soon as there is chinese community for komodo that it can rapidly increase to a level appropriate for being a long time resident on the ccid list

[21-Nov-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> I wonder what aspect of Komodo is resonating most with China.
Are they excited for the DEX?
Are they looking for "ETH killers" and the tech and transaction speed potential?
Are they passionate about open source? 
Projects building ecosystems without rent seeking tokens?
Does Komodo sound cool in Mandarin?

[21-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> I suspect most exchanges keep this information close to their chest but tens of thousands of wallets seems like a lot, do you know of any good behind the scenes type video or article on running an exchange (re @Regnar: It isn't necessarily "maintenance". All the exchanges are informed of hard updates to the chain weeks in advance to ensure they are all ready to update their wallets when it comes time. This isn't Komodo saying disable your wallets weeks in advance for "reasons" or anything, in fact some exchanges still have wallets open and will likely keep them open until a day or two prior. 
Exchanges manage their own risk in this way. Exchanges like Binance play it safe and will disable deposits and withdrawals likely so they can either prepare to update the tens of thousands of KMD wallets they have, or so they can consolidate funds in cold storage, update all their hot wallets, and so on.)

i think china likes the komodo ability for creating independent blockchains, among other things. the big push from the president was to basically build blockchains for everything possible. of course, dragons are cool in china too

[21-Nov-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
quantum security, atomicDEX, smartchains, komodo has something for pretty much anyone. multichain projects are quite popular

[21-Nov-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Yes, with a new china facing website you can collect data on what they seem most interested in, pages with the most traffic. 
My bias is that many people invest in crypto for unserious reasons, and I expect it to be the same in china.
Dragons. 
Or a random Chinese meme about wanting 7150 coins so you can "stake" and get 365 coins per year.
But it could indeed be multichain stuff, which is not so frivolous

[21-Nov-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
combination of everything is the correct answer

[21-Nov-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo has the credibility of being a deep tech project, on the govt ccid list, so will be one of the surviving alt projects. this cycle i think there will be a lot of altcoins that just dont recover, mostly the long term surviving projects will fully participate in the next bull market

[21-Nov-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Craig> Certainly it could be a combination of everything, there is a lot to like.
 I hope the team will keep an eye open to see if any one thing stands out.
Not to increase hype by emphasizing a certain area, but because china could indeed be a big market and it pays to listen closely to what the market wants. Even if at the same time the market is sometimes stupid.
Carry on the great work

[telegram] <Regnar> I think it's important to remember that right now Atomicdex is a mobile app. Due to space, resource, and hardware restrictions it likely wont have the same level of features as Binance Mobile. I could be wrong here, Atomicdex may end up like this. However Binance uses APIs to their own servers which are very light, that is the benefit of being centralized, but with the obvious drawbacks (sim swap attacks, hacks, disabled wallets, regulation etc) (re @Craig: Thanks for all the in depth responses regnar. You're a passionate guy. 
Let me try to phrase a question that's important to me. 
Take IDEX.
You visit the website and there's a funny thing you need to do, "unlocking your wallet". A few other funny things later when you want to "withdraw"
This throws off some people. But people know it's a DEX or something a little weird. So most people push on past the weirdness.
Honestly it's probably because IDEX has interesting coins that aren't listed anywhere else, not because the average user really cares about holding their keys.
 But no worries, they push on.
One big reason is they push on is because there's a list of like 100 tokens, visible on the front page, that gives their daily volume and % change in price. Also there are charts. Basically it looks like an underdesigned version of binance or another CEX.
The user then goes about his business trading with just a few quirks. Also things are slow, the website kinda lags, but it's ok because it's a DEX and a lot of coins are only possible to find there.
So the vision for atomicDEX, is it similar to that? Where a user will have to accept a few minor annoying tradeoffs in order to trade in a way roughly like a centralized exchange? 
Or is using atomicDEX going to be a radically different experience than a centralized exchange?
Another way to put it:
What tradeoffs will atomic dex accept, and what bonuses will it have besides less counterparty risk, no kycaml, your keys your coins?)

Just watch a deposit move around (re @Cabey: I suspect most exchanges keep this information close to their chest but tens of thousands of wallets seems like a lot, do you know of any good behind the scenes type video or article on running an exchange)

[telegram] <Regnar> But AtomicDEX isn't limited to JUST mobile, or just websites, etc. It is an API layer that shares all liquidity. There are already desktop apps that are sharing liquidity and using the Atomicapi to trade desktop with mobile. 
AtomicDEX being a mobile app, I don't expect to take on the role if a full fledged trading DEX app, it might be this in the future with charts and order types etc. But I personally think it would be better positioned against instant swap services like changelly and shapeshift, like it was suggested here to simple have a "best price/instant swap" setting. I think mobile apps should keep functionality as basic and simple as possible, let websites have tons of features. but I don't make these decisions. (re @Craig: Framing it as an OTC market helps thanks.
Here i am saying I hate trading and then complaining there aren't enough features. 
It's just, there are other DEXs out there that have, or plan to have, a lot more that OTC style markets. Im not sure I ever expected leverage or derivatives and so on with atomicDEX. 
We will see how it goes I guess)

[21-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It could be a trading DEX app, or it can be a wallet with instant swap functions. I think swaps would be better for a mobile app, and desktop and website apps would be better suited for the full fledged trading experience (drawing on charts, zooming out, multiple order types, trollbox, massive orderbook views, all coin prices and changes etc) just like we see with most DEXs and CEXs. 
Again take this with a grain of salt, I'm just a community volunteer, not a decision maker for Komodo

[21-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Hey this page shows deposits still in 0conf and gives access to some of the files needed to claim them (according to the guide) but you'll need the other info as well.
If you organize by deposit size you can see your 2k KMD. 
https://dexstats.info/finddeposit.php (re @Amalgamus: Thanks for answering. That's how I wrecked my computer. As i had tried all I could with my very limited capacity, I ended up installing linux and was never able to claim anything by myself. What I find frustrating is that when you send those coins they tell you you can claim them back easily. But why the address you sent them to doesn't sent them back when the option to claim them back just disappeared from your wallet? That's called stealing if this wallet doesn't send the coins back to the owner.)

[21-Nov-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
conspiracy theorists. they need some reason to explain why the price goes up and i guess cant believe it actually went up

[21-Nov-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so they make reasons why even though it went up, it shouldnt have. i guess

[21-Nov-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact that the price rise and fall is happening with the wallet the same, indicates strongly that wallet being closed is not the main factor. i posted earlier all the china developments, which are indeed real. for a while there, KMD was trading like it was a chinese crypto as the volumes from china overwhelmed the other volume
