[telegram] <Werxadler> I see, i had a very simple guide, will check if i can find the link (re @DigitalWealthCreator: I have old address and old seed. I want to recreate the wallet like I had it before. But the instructions given above by admin are way too complicated to do on one computer I think.)

[telegram] <Werxadler> If you talk about komodo only it should be even more easy

[07-Jun-19 10:31 PM] gcharang#6833
DigitalWealthCreator

You can do it on one computer
just create a new seed on Verus Agama: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029948-create-new-address-in-lite-mode-with-verus-agama
you will have wallet-name and pin as you like

then backup the seed and address, logout

Signin using the old seed: wnter old seed in the blanl above the orange button that says wallet seed/wif
from there, send to new address

[07-Jun-19 10:32 PM] gcharang#6833
* Signin using the old seed: enter old seed in the blank above the orange button(Sign in) that says wallet seed/wif

[telegram] <wktong> Can we trust the web wallet? (re @mo7881: Magnum wallet. Its very easy)

[08-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> I was able to open agama and get the private key. For some reason my seed phrase wouldn't work on Magnum wallet. If seed phrase won't export then copy the private key from agama, load into the new wallet and transfer the balance to the new address. I just did it (re @DigitalWealthCreator: I created the seed phrase in the old Agama wallet and the seed phrase I have, but using the seed phrase will not recreate the wallet like I had it before with the name of the wallet and the PIN to open it up. I have all of that but want to recreate it in this new version of the AGAMA wallet. Thanks.)

[08-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jun-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Wil> From Veruscoin Discord
üëá
everyone @Asher has just posted a new NON-MANDATORY release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet with native and SPV support for more coins, including Verus (of course), KMD, ARRR, a number of popular ERC20 tokens, K64, and ZEXO. We pushed hard to get out this release as a safe GUI alternative for many Komodo family coins.Most Komodo family coins are supported in both native and SPV modes. Please make sure if you're moving to Verus Enhanced Agama from the Komodo Agama wallet that you do not reuse your old keys, and instead create a new wallet with new keys.
This release adds a lot of new coins and although it prepares for PBaaS, does not include the PBaaS features that are running on testnet now. For testing, you should visit the #pbaas-development channel and start with the PBaaS Technology Preview.
Again, Verus Agama was never affected by the recent vulnerability in Komodo Agama, so although we are quite happy with this upgrade is it NOT MANDATORY.
Thanks to @michaeltoutjr and @Asher and everyone who helped for pushing to get this out quickly with more support for our friends across the Komodo ecosystem.

[telegram] <Zeehenk> Question about claiming rewards on ledger:
When trying to claim rewards (latest chrome) I go through the motions, but if I wait to check the address/funds it gives me a timeout. Even after just a few seconds. If I just keep clicking without checking it works, but it doesn't feel right for me.... anyone else experiencing this?

[telegram] <Cryppto> Yes. He would not buy himself an Android phone, uses iPhone and iMac exclusively, gets into unnecessary troubles. All he needed to do was to install a Coinomi or Magnum Wallet app, create a Komodo wallet in Coinomi or Magnum and safely move all his KMD there. Would take him less than 10 minutes. (re @cryptovoyage: well the video just before that one was not too flattering, but alos shows he is not ready for crypto. has no idea what Ubuntu is or any idea on wallet useage, and so he was in trouble when placed under stress..)

[telegram] <LuckyBTC> Is your Komodo app up to date? I think latest version is 1.3.9 (re @Zeehenk: Question about claiming rewards on ledger:

[telegram] <Zeehenk> I'm pretty sure this is lukes

[08-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zeehenk> Not sure if I'm up to date. I'll check!

[08-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <LuckyBTC> Haven't tried magnum yet.

[08-Jun-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <LuckyBTC> Okay. (re @Zeehenk: Not sure if I'm up to date. I'll check!)

[08-Jun-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zeehenk> It used to work perfectly for me too.... now getting these time outs. When I want to confirm the ledger just goes to the "menu" of the kmd app.... after a while it times out (re @LuckyBTC: Last time i used luke's app, Everything worked perfectly.)

[08-Jun-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <claushein55> I just need some help with my Agama wallet - it appears to have been hacked ???

[08-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <KryptoKiwi_2> So there are 2 versions of the Agama wallet that look the same & called the same but are different. What Einstein thought to do that? (re @Wil: From Veruscoin Discord

everyone @Asher has just posted a new NON-MANDATORY release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet with native and SPV support for more coins, including Verus (of course), KMD, ARRR, a number of popular ERC20 tokens, K64, and ZEXO. We pushed hard to get out this release as a safe GUI alternative for many Komodo family coins.Most Komodo family coins are supported in both native and SPV modes. Please make sure if you're moving to Verus Enhanced Agama from the Komodo Agama wallet that you do not reuse your old keys, and instead create a new wallet with new keys.
This release adds a lot of new coins and although it prepares for PBaaS, does not include the PBaaS features that are running on testnet now. For testing, you should visit the #pbaas-development channel and start with the PBaaS Technology Preview.
Again, Verus Agama was never affected by the recent vulnerability in Komodo Agama, so although we are quite happy with this upgrade is it NOT MANDATORY.
Thanks to @michaeltoutjr and @Asher and everyone who helped for pushing to get this out quickly with more support for our friends across the Komodo ecosystem.
GUI: https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.5.7
