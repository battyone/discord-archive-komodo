I am of course speaking about development and would like to hear your ideas where to go from here. Price is only thing that is not following... logically meaning it's undervalued and should be accumated. But if you mean by "get your project straight" that "magically reverse the market conditions and make it pump regardless of development" then I guess it's better to shut up, hold and wait. And please do not give me answers like the one here, i get my daily dose of living energy laughing at internet retards (re @truth: actually xrp doesnt have constant problems like kmd so shut the fuck up yourself and get your project straight)
