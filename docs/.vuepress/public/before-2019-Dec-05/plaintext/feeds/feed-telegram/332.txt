[telegram] <tele090> If passible stop agama service worldwide

[05-Jun-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> Need protect wallets

[05-Jun-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> I think your taking on too much responsibility , imagen you buy a new car the brakes fail 6 months in  after a recommendation of 3 years usage will you blame your self? (re @Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe: Then it is my responsibility to make my apps build on kmd secure)

[05-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> But isn't that the whole point in crypto money? Being responsible for my own funds and not rely on a bank?

[05-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> like that! If there was another method - this one would not use. - but the vulnerability seems to be serious! Well, this is his stacking - on the hardware store all you need or on paper! (re @Keytothegate: It is true that a lot of effort needs to be put on wallet / security testing in the future. This time the vulnerability was spotted at the very last moment and they had time to save almost everything. Although the move made was pretty radical I think it was the only move. Otherwise...the risk was simply too big.)

[05-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> yes but the wallet got hacked this is not a CEX issue (re @Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe: But isn't that the whole point in crypto money? Being responsible for my own funds and not rely on a bank?)

[05-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> only applies to CEX

[05-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <lion_musk> why you can not roll back the network, because this attack is no less serious than the attack 51? (re @Keytothegate: It is true that a lot of effort needs to be put on wallet / security testing in the future.

[05-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Yeah and therefore I decided beforehand not to safe funds in agama since it was beta

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> I just waited for something like that on an unfinished product

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Ok 5

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> %

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Yes you're right

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> The 5% is gone then

[05-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> is pretty tempting well you paid the price

[05-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> for safety

[05-Jun-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Exactly! For sure one lesson learned! Stay safe and do not be greedy üòÇ

[05-Jun-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> but you lose

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> it you think about it

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> if the funds are gone forever then KMD loses you lose as price fall , and you gain nothing

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> but if kmd recovers and pays back funds upside for every one and more for 5% earners

[05-Jun-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> It‚Äôs infinitely less serious than a 51% attack. Not even remotely comparable. This was an attack through a nodejs module Agama is using. The chain has not been compromised, at all. There is nothing to roll back. (re @lion_musk: why you can not roll back the network, because this attack is no less serious than the attack 51?)

[05-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> From what i understood earlier  the missing coins that hacker got were sent to binance (?). You can see that they have suspended deposits and withdrawals and I understood that these coins were frozen. Can some admin confirm this?

[05-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> so your not really gaining technically

[05-Jun-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yes it is related. We are in direct contact with the Binance team. Looks like the attacker was foolish enough to send part of the stolen coins there ‚Äî those can and will be recovered (re @Keytothegate: From what i understood earlier  the missing coins that hacker got were sent to binance (?).

[05-Jun-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> Yes, I also think there will be a decline in price! But I hope kmd will just abandon that node shit in their apps! When they focus on the api and providing kmd tech to companies and developers for broader use, the value will rise and I'll make profit for sure.

[05-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> That Agama got hacked doesn't come as a surprise to me.
The Android app has not been updated for a very long time

[05-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> No Nodejs, ever, anywhere. The new wallet (in closed beta, VERY soon public beta) doesn‚Äôt have a single line of JavaScript (re @Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe: Yes, I also think there will be a decline in price! But I hope kmd will just abandon that node shit in their apps!

[05-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I guess (for example) this gives also a small glimpse of hope of identifying the person(s) behind this attack? üôÇ (re @torsten1: Yes it is related. We are in direct contact with the Binance team. Looks like the attacker was foolish enough to send part of the stolen coins there ‚Äî those can and will be recovered)

[05-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> Other coins missing or only komodo ?

[05-Jun-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Maybe but not very likely. Binance does not have KYC. (re @Keytothegate: I guess (for example) this gives also a small glimpse of hope of identifying the person(s) behind this attack? üôÇ)

[05-Jun-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We are still assessing the damage, too early to tell. (re @tele090: Other coins missing or only komodo ?)

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <inetics> The exploit used is fixed or I can try to use it? ü§™ (re @torsten1: We are still assessing the damage, too early to tell.)

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> You should transfer all btc, kmd and kmd asset chain coins to a new address just to be sure. Don't know if losses are only kmd though (re @tele090: Other coins missing or only komodo ?)

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <crypshotta> If your kmd is still in your agama wallet, does it mean I should still move my coins to a new wallet?

[05-Jun-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> Please answer what version of the application wallet vulnerability? which platform? (re @torsten1: No Nodejs, ever, anywhere. The new wallet (in closed beta, VERY soon public beta) doesn‚Äôt have a single line of JavaScript)

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> you a kmd team member? (re @torsten1: We are still assessing the damage, too early to tell.)

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> There‚Äôs nothing left to steal so doesn‚Äôt worth your time believe me :) We saves about 90% of the funds, 10% lost but hopefully a lot of it can be recovered (re @inetics: The exploit used is fixed or I can try to use it? ü§™)

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> or DEV

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yes (re @Ra: you a kmd team member?)

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> But marketing, not dev

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> What will the new wallet use in place of nodes

[05-Jun-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> and how will it be better secure

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> About the 5% Rewards. I think JL was saying that there are many accounts that do not claim so those might be used for covered funds.

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <inetics> It's amazing, so in future one of you guys can decide to "save" funds but this time for himself? How come you had access to people's assets? (re @torsten1: There‚Äôs nothing left to steal so doesn‚Äôt worth your time believe me :) We saves about 90% of the funds, 10% lost but hopefully a lot of it can be recovered)

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> All platforms, only Agama. I am not sure which versions but roughly all versions after 1 Feb (re @xarux: Please answer what version of the application wallet vulnerability? which platform?)

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> no take it out of the incompetent DEV salary who mess this up lol

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> when can we expect the new wallet release (re @torsten1: All platforms, only Agama. I am not sure which versions but roughly all versions after 1 Feb)

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Normally they would not have access, they used the same vulnerability that the hackers used. (re @inetics: It's amazing, so in future one of you guys can decide to "save" funds but this time for himself? How come you had access to people's assets?)

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Please read our announcement on the site and on Twitter. We used the same vulnerability the hacker wanted to use, when we discovered it. I understand it‚Äôs not ideal but it was the best bad choice. We do not have access to seeds, only through this vulnerability, only to seeds created with Agama and only in the last 4 months. (re @inetics: It's amazing, so in future one of you guys can decide to "save" funds but this time for himself? How come you had access to people's assets?)

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> So much for "not your keys - not your funds" smh (re @inetics: It's amazing, so in future one of you guys can decide to "save" funds but this time for himself? How come you had access to people's assets?)

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <inetics> Thanks, but then how come the hackers only got 10prc? You guys found the bug at the similar time or what? (re @yorklab: Normally they would not have access, they used the same vulnerability that the hackers used.)

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tele090> Only online agama is denger for coins ?

[05-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> You can read about it above - they spotted the vulnerability injected by the attacker and were just in time to use it before  him/her/them. Obviously it was radical but absolutely had to be done in order to save the situation (re @inetics: It's amazing, so in future one of you guys can decide to "save" funds but this time for himself? How come you had access to people's assets?)

[05-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> The hacker was waiting and accumulating seeds. When we discovered we moved faster than him. Based on the speed he tried to sweep the funds manually one by one so he was slow. (re @inetics: Thanks, but then how come the hackers only got 10prc? You guys found the bug at the similar time or what?)

[05-Jun-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <inetics> If what they say is true about using the same bug that kmd guys used then fine, we still save (re @CryptoBlockchain38: So much for "not your keys - not your funds" smh)

[05-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> The problem with Komodo is that they have a very small Team working on many different things at the same time not to mention the poor Marketing. 
Now it's in the spotlight because Agama Wallet got hacked

[05-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> It was basically a race against the hacker, when we started sweeping funds he started it too. We were much faster.

[05-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> What i understood it was not only bug but someone planned it carefully, injected some venomous code on agama libraries and was really dedicated to make a lot of damage (re @inetics: If what they say is true about using the same bug that kmd guys used then fine, we still save)

[05-Jun-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Exactly. Even worse because the code was not injected into Agama libraries but into third part dependencies Agama used (re @Keytothegate: What i understood it was not only bug but someone planned it carefully, injected some venomous code on agama libraries and was really dedicated to make a lot of damage)

[05-Jun-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Agama will get a security update but honestly we were phasing out Agama in favor of the new wallet anyway (in private beta currently) (re @Donnie: When can we use agama again will there be a update or something ?)
