[telegram] <Regnar> No, it looks like that is accrued rewards. That balance is too small to get .71 kmd a day. 
(195 √ó 5.1%)/365 = 0.027 kmd per day. So that looks like roughly 26 days of accruing rewards. Once a month is all you need (re @Umitkara48: Is that 0.71 kmd daily reward ?)

[telegram] <R.> Last time i wondered what does "once a month" means .. does it mean once every 30/31 days .. or does it mean once per month?

[05-Oct-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> I guess its the same

[05-Oct-18 05:28 PM] gcharang#6833
Do it per 28 days. It can't hurt you if you do it more frequently. the 1 month is based on block counts which can vary based on increase/decrease in network hashrate and other factors

[05-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> Ok thanks .. because its a difference if i claim once a month or p.ex on 2.10 an next time on 28.11 .. but it would still be once a month üòÜ
