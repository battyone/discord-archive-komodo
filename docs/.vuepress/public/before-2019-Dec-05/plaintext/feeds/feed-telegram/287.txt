no KMD officials are behind the project, just me. The Komodo mention on the bottom of the page mentions Komodo Community, not official team ;)
About the current tech used, **NO** it doesn't use atomic swapping. You will be able to find the reasons, and foresee the roadmap via medium links, won't explain everything here, but to sum up, Today, we got a classic infrastructure, and our goal is to get rid of it using atomicswaps if / when possible, and mix that with any other cool tech that will allow more and more coins to be added :

[telegram] <Coraline> Hi! I actually love this project and the effort which is put in! One of the best crypto communities so far, obviously I will also do my part! I did find a channel called @JustChimeraCrypto and they gave good calls so far, no pump and dump or sketchy shit. Check them out, I have made a few bucks with them so far!

[04-May-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlastoff> Is dPoW a shared cost spread equally across all participating networks? In other words, when a new project comes aboard, does that drive down costs for everyone?

[04-May-19 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <freerider101> each dpow for a chain cost 300kmd/year (re @CryptoBlastoff: Is dPoW a shared cost spread equally across all participating networks? In other words, when a new project comes aboard, does that drive down costs for everyone?)

[04-May-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> That’s the old price ...

[04-May-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The current price is roughly $2500 USD + 365KMD per year + Security Review for external chains

[04-May-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The kmd team created a ladder pricing which increases every time a new project is added. We just added Koinon to dpow which means the next project pays a slightly higher price until 100 projects are reached at which point the price will be $10000/y

[04-May-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The sooner you get added the better

[04-May-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kremer (n k)> Does the cost in KMD appreciate? Or only cost in USD has appreciation?

[04-May-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kremer (n k)> In other words, it's 365 kmd right now. Does that increase as more chains onboard like you're saying occurs with USD

[04-May-19 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlastoff> Thx 👍 (re @PTYX11: The kmd team created a ladder pricing which increases every time a new project is added. We just added Koinon to dpow which means the next project pays a slightly higher price until 100 projects are reached at which point the price will be $10000/y)

[04-May-19 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> The KMD portion remains at 365,  the reason that number was chosen was to attach the quality of a “unit of account” to the currency.  1 KMD = direct cost of notarization for one chain for one day

[05-May-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Usually NNs are community members who have been working and building in Komodo ecosystem and build up reputation and respect. The elections are a good way to help the ecosystem grow, which is why you see NNs dedicating mining rewards to fund new startups like Komodore64 and Barterlly, as well as established businesses running for NN to fund their projects (which also help the ecosystem)
