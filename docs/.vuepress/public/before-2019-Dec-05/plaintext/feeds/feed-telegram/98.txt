[10-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> Exactly

[10-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> There are many kmd in the wallet

[10-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> But is some hours that i cant claim the reward

[10-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> From the Agama wallet send the entire amount back to yourself.

[10-Aug-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> If you want to keep your cold storage I will suggest watching this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBdGI8pu7M you can do this procedure also with Agama while offline if you want an extra layer of security. But for more convenient use do what Yorklab is suggesting and send your balance to your own public address to set the locktime. If you still haven't moved your funds from ledger try using the procedure in the video. (re @Seppe: Exactly)

[telegram] <TheRickestMorty> What is Komodo's current solution to extracting off chain data?

[10-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Here's the problem. KMD rewards work on a thing called nlocktime. If I remember correctly, this is a time stamp of when the transaction happened and it's stored in Unix time (Had to look this up first time) but not all transactions set nlocktime by default. if a UTXO doesn't have nlocktime set, it won't gain rewards. So wallets like Agama, and Guarda set locktime by default, and they also set it in the transaction when you "claim rewards". but wallets like Ledger are not set up to view nlocktime and are not set up to set it when you send from their wallet. so when it arrives in your Agama wallet, nlocktime is not set. So if you send to yourself from Agama it will set locktime and start gaining rewards. (re @Seppe: Moved from agama to Ledger than from ledger to agama)

[10-Aug-18 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> don't ask me why Ledger doesn't set this haha, I'm not sure.

[10-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> you can see locktime has a value, that means it was set for that transaction

[10-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Pretty sure how that all works lol I'm sure someone can chime in and verify or clarify

[10-Aug-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> Great! Thank you for the explanation (re @Regnar: Here's the problem. KMD rewards work on a thing called nlocktime. If I remember correctly, this is a time stamp of when the transaction happened and it's stored in Unix time (Had to look this up first time) but not all transactions set nlocktime by default. if a UTXO doesn't have nlocktime set, it won't gain rewards.

So if you send to yourself from Agama it will set locktime and start gaining rewards.)

[10-Aug-18 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No problem! sometimes things aren't so simple. it's also one of the main reasons why KMD can gain rewards even when your wallet is closed, and why KMD is not like proof of stake coins. (re @Seppe: Great! Thank you for the explanation)

[10-Aug-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yes they both earn coins, seemingly in the same way, but in reality the mechanism behind it is different

[10-Aug-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seppe> Will it ever be possible to improve the wallet on ledger?

[10-Aug-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes

[10-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So ledger hasn't been too receptive on adding support for KMD rewards, I believe they said they didn't want to complicate their UTXO selection, which basically means they want their wallets (regardless of coin) to be all the same. which is lame lol.

[10-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> but

[10-Aug-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo can integrate ledger support into Agama wallet, which will allow us to handle the rewards part, but store private keys in the ledger.

[10-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> this isn't done, and I don't have an ETA on it unfortunately, that's above my head. But that is the most likely/best course of action for all Ledger users, of which I am one.

[telegram] <Regnar> The reason why Komodo notarizes to Bitcoin is because of the huge amount of hash power bitcoin has that makes 51% attacks very unlikely. Komodo uses Proof of Work for it's own mining algorithm for transactions, what we use Bitcoin for is to essentially store a fingerprint (notarization) of the Komodo blockchain to bitcoin every 10 minutes. This means if someone tries to 51% attack Komodo they can't change anything that was in that fingerprint on Bitcoin, unless they 51% attack bitcoin as well and specifically alter that fingerprint (to the new one they need for the attack to work). 
So technically if someone were able to 51% attack bitcoin, it wouldn't affect Komodo because we only store these fingerprints there. Komodo still mines just like any other blockchain and we can actually switch where we store fingerprints to the next strongest chain to keep dPoW security up (if Bitcoin is attacked we could store it on Ethereum, or Litecoin, or bitcoincash or w.e works best.) 
So to attack komodo they need to gain 51% of KMD hashrate, as well as 51% of Bitcoin hashrate (to change the notarizations) at the same time. If they JUST attack BTC, Komodo can notarize to a different blockchain and run fine on its own mining. If they JUST attack Komodo they won't be able to change past notarizations and if their "double spend" transaction gets notarized while they are performing their attack, they won't be able to reverse it by releasing their malicious blocks. 
I hope I explained this properly, there's likely some stuff I simplified greatly haha. hope it helps (re @Crypto: I am discussing the security of KMD and a guy just asked me, what happens if BTC is 51% attacked?)
