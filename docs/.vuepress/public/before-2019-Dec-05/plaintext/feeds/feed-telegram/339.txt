[telegram] <Bram4> I moved my funds in time, but have a question, if you go into agama lite with a password and not your seed directly, are you still affected?

[06-Jun-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833

yes

[06-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ethanwilliamg> So what does all this say about KMDs tech if people can’t even feel safe using a native wallet?

[06-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ethanwilliamg> Getting hacked even when you are in control of your seed is pretty bad

[06-Jun-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
Yesterday, the npm, Inc. security team, in collaboration with Komodo, helped protect over $13 million USD in cryptocurrency assets as we found and responded to a malware threat targeting the users of a cryptocurrency wallet called Agama.

This attack focused on getting a malicious package into the build chain for Agama and stealing the wallet seeds and other login passphrases used within the application.

The details
The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a “useful” package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.

[06-Jun-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
sawlysawly started by making contributions that were real, only when the electron-native-notify was made part of agama did he inject the exploit

[06-Jun-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
move the kmd if you used the exploited wallet

[06-Jun-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
all the other wallets were not affected, the main komodod was not affected.

[06-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this was a months long heist well planned and executed and i imagine most all projects could be attacked in the same way (and many others have). no complex system is bug proof, and bugs can be exploited, or a regular contributor can be a hacker in disguise. anyway, the important thing is how such events are handled as all projects can be attacked.

definitely. A more secure one for sure
for native, we already have KomodoOceanQt
fir litemode, we were already developing a better wallet than Agama

Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the unsafe versions of Agama
