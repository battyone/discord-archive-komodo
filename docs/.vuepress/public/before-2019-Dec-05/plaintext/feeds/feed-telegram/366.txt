[telegram] <Cryppto> $1.4 has held (orange line). Good. We probably found the bottom. MACD suggests so. KMD may resume climbing soon.

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> There is weekly support on 1,40 usd. Kept it good so far. I hope it will not break and we will go up soon. (re @Cryppto: $1.4 has held (orange line). Good. We probably found the bottom. MACD suggests so. KMD may resume climbing soon.)

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> I would wait to see what will do btc. We are on the weekly support now. But it can break. So lets wait a little bit. You can buy %5 cheaper or expensive. No matter. (re @Hosnstoi: Should I buy komodo now?)
