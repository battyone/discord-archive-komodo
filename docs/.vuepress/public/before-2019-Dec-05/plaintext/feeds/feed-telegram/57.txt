[telegram] <geeksri> Kucoin is doing it as a marketing stunt :)

[14-Jul-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bpetridis> Well ill be stacking that commision in the mean time, man never thought id be able to afford a couple thousand kmd with spare money. Am I the only one enjoying this bear market. Buying stuff i never thought I could afford its like we wound the clock back 12 months. (re @Seko: I‚Äòm sure, that the time will be come...)

[14-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> I do not believe you. For KMD to have a value, KMD must have an equivalent. Especially use-case... (re @N21_0: for me 1 KMD = 1 KMD i don't care about BTC or Fiat Price any more)

[14-Jul-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> H√§? I send the current price and therefore you mean that I'm scared? Haha. Sorry Bro, I trust KMD. And when KMD drops more, I don‚Äôt give a shit...;) (re @N21_0: i can see KMD at 60$ - 90$ this year if you are angry about 1.50$ now remmeber LTC when crashed from 40$ to 1$)

[14-Jul-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> That was not the reason why I post the current price. We do it in the German group every day. It‚Äòs only an information...

[14-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> I think so. Most of the coins I have never heard... (re @Acura360: Too much bots are voting & cheating for others)

[14-Jul-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> That is my opinion. I like this market, now. And I have trust in Komodo and in the eco-system... (re @bpetridis: Well ill be stacking that commision in the mean time, man never thought id be able to afford a couple thousand kmd with spare money. Am I the only one enjoying this bear market. Buying stuff i never thought I could afford its like we wound the clock back 12 months.)

[14-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> Nevertheless, there are many things that worry me. For example the manipulation in the market and the secure. The secure is one of the advantages of Komodo.

[14-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I know some of the new Asset Chains (dICOs) will need Smart Contracts to work. So they will be (most likely) experimenting with the paralle chain.

[14-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seko> Very important for new dICOs or for ERC20, which come to Komodo. But then Komodo would be a competitor. Komodo is Komodo and therefore unique...
