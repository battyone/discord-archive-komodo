[telegram] <Marcauj> Komodore64 has a coin ?

[20-May-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rainbowpiez> Very interesting and mysterious. Glad to see good companies using komdo, the only crypto coin with great tech. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <Meyse> We, K64, are noteworthy. You already answered your own suspicions üòâ)

[20-May-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rainbowpiez> Komodo is also the only coin, that I know of, that has all communication channels integrated. Really awesome stuff. Most comments get lost in other coin groups.

[telegram] <Techwyrm> Thx for your detailed response. Makes complete sense. (re @Regnar: So this encryption is definitely useful for if your laptop is stolen, or if someone uses it while you're away. They will be able to open the native wallet but any meaningful actions like sending a transaction or exporting the private keys won't work without the password)

[20-May-19 05:34 PM] cipi#4502
it is easier to encrypt the entire hard drive... it will ask for the passphrease when you boot up

[21-May-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Yash> Anyways I feel that kmd has not at all recovered from down trend 
So you might see a 10/15% push upside today

[21-May-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems if people want to be chasing the next IEO pump and dont have the patience for KMD, then that explains why the price is down.

[21-May-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing we can do will make KMD price pump like the hottest IEO of the day. that is unrealistic demand. so if that is your demand, then consider it that the team wont be able to do it

[21-May-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, once all the impatient money sells, there is nobody else left to sell and the price will go up

[21-May-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Werxadler> It doesn't make me nervous at all if kmd is not pumping like hell, what i know for sure is that i own 5% more kmd in one year, and it will go higher a lot sooner or later

[21-May-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the team will keep improving the tech, marketing, and the things we can control. we wont try to pretend we can control the marketprice

[21-May-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> it's always the same. People sell at this price and buy back after a pump. The same as with BTC when the price was 3100$.... now the people are annoyed that they did not buy! So many people around me are talking to me NOW about BTC, but when I was talking about BTC when they were at their low for the year, nobody wanted to know anything about btc. That's what makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

[21-May-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
there are literally thousands of cryptos. on any given day the top 0.1% will be going up double digit percentages or more. why cant KMD be in this 0.1% top gainers every day? that seems to be what the complaint is

[21-May-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
let us be realistic

[21-May-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
market prices are unpredictable and often dont make sense, so why demand that it make sense?

[21-May-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if anybody has 1000 BTC, then they could indeed pump the price to make such peoples happy. however, I expect any whales with such funds would prefer you sell to them at 14k, so they can sell at 30k and above

[21-May-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and the fiat price is basically unchanged for the recent time period, which explains the inverse to BTC pricemovement
