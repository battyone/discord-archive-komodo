[telegram] <Rubinho> For example.. vechain has veforge that is working beautifuly with staking and the ledger

[telegram] <Rubinho> staking with ledger*

[09-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n2okpride> Agreed, that's why since we've finished building the foundational architecture, we're moving focuses on building out our developer community, documentation, training, and are moving towards development of a smart contract reference library.

[09-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Mm1.0 is a proof of concept. As it is right now it still is ages ahead of similar concepts. It should be jaw dropping even as it currently is. The real problem bdex confronts is the prostitution of the "atomic swap" name by ETH tokens.

[09-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n2okpride> Also in plan is building a GUI frontend for blockchain creation, customization, etc.

if everything was perfect already, we would be done and have nothing to do

[09-Aug-18 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a process of continuous improvement

[09-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <james> Ethereum has solidity.  Is there equivalent for Komodo?

[09-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> correct. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> if everything was perfect already, we would be done and have nothing to do)

[09-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> Kaizen approach? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> it is a process of continuous improvement)

[09-Aug-18 09:56 PM] jl777c#5810
CC contracts are native code running at full speed.

[09-Aug-18 09:56 PM] jl777c#5810
any language that can be compiled into a library can be used, but we are just getting started with making different language bindings and it wouldneed to interface to the c/c++ functions inside the komodod

[09-Aug-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
my thinking is that blockchain coding is difficult and not something end users or casual programmers should be doing

[09-Aug-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
such can and have led to some very expensive errors

[09-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <james> OK.  So it is c++

[09-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> could you walk me thought how am I (the end user) going to use KMD in the system? is KMD like GAS for the platform?

[09-Aug-18 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
even experienced blockchain devs make errors

[09-Aug-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
C++ is the easiest, but any language that compiles would be able to be used

[09-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, I don‚Äôt want to mess with that bullshit :P (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> my thinking is that blockchain coding is difficult and not something end users or casual programmers should be doing)

[09-Aug-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
rust would likely not be too hard to interface to

[09-Aug-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the CC contracts tend to be configurable, so the user can determine the settings of the rewards and not have to code it

[09-Aug-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
of course a full blockchain project creating their own dapp would need to still create their own dapp

[09-Aug-18 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but on their own chain, there is no crazy txfee, congestion, etc

[09-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> This is probably a more general Blockchain question. But how are contract fees calculated? If there‚Äôs a contract that requires massive Processing, how is that governed/limited?

[09-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Like if it‚Äôs some insanely long physics simulation.

[09-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I know that isn‚Äôt typically what it‚Äôs used for, but just for sake of discussion.

[09-Aug-18 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be up to each chain

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Speed Trading mode requires KMD (re @hifonz: one thing I'm still parsing through is how KMD is to be used (if at all) on Barterdex - assuming atomic swaps are simply chain to chain)

[10-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> so one thing im concerned about, now that the marketing/messaging is turning more towards enterprise/business adoption of the achitecture/platform/tech

[10-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> would that have negative effect on consumers / investors / speculators wanting to buy it and create demand / upwards pressure on price?

[10-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is pointless to make such predictions. what will the overall crypto marketcap be in 2020? what rank will KMD be? then and only then can you get a rough price estimate

I'll take 7 trillion mcap and kmd 1% of mcap
