[telegram] <changemymindk> The thing with money is that u always will want more. (re @DrgnAngel: How many KMD should I own to be happy sometime in 2020?)

[telegram] <Jarhard> Can I claim rewards on chainzilla or no?

[03-Mar-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Not this most recent release, I believe the next update will include a claim feature. Definitely worth getting right now and trying it out, then just updating when the claim function releases (re @Jarhard: Can I claim rewards on chainzilla or no?)

[03-Mar-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jarhard> I downloaded and sent a few hundred KMD to it. I like the simplicity. Wondering if I should send 3k KMD to it  and trust them on there or if I should plug in my laptop and set it up on agama. I just never use my laptops for anything really. So id forget to claim rewards and such. Thanks for all of the help.

[03-Mar-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I wouldn't recommend storing that much money in a mobile wallet, it's the equivalent of walking around with thousands in your pocket. You should store larger amounts offline, on a desktop, or hardware wallets. It adds a physical layer of separation between a would be thief and your funds. Last thing you want is to get mugged and they force you at gun point to access and send your funds out. (re @Jarhard: I downloaded and sent a few hundred KMD to it. I like the simplicity.

[03-Mar-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jarhard> Appreciate the advice. I will use agama for it. Greatly appreciate your time.

[03-Mar-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No problem! If you have Ledger, komodo is supported and you can claim rewards with Komodos claim app or even Magnum wallet. I believe Trezor is adding Komodo as well on their next update (re @Jarhard: Appreciate the advice. I will use agama for it. Greatly appreciate your time.)
