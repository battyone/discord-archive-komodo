[telegram] <PTYX11> We had a small airdrop planned for airdropalert but the process has been stalled due to a problem with the civic app. (re @Zeehenk: Any airdrop going on too....?)

[telegram] <Zeehenk> For ledger holders: any way to receive an airdrop without compromising your passphrse (re @PTYX11: We are doing social media bounties on discord but there aren't any major airdrops planned for some time.

[11-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You can access your chainzilla tokens with your ledger through app.magnumwallet.co

[11-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> That means that if you had an address with Komodo and we did an airdrop, you don't need to export your seed. You just use your ledger with Magnum and you will be able to find the correct address path and see the funds for both KMD and ZILLA

[11-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763

Tech Tuesday Update #14: A Summary Of Last Week's Development - Komodo
Komodo Platform is starting a weekly briefing on the progress the Komodo Dev Team is making. It's called Tech Tuesday Update. Here's another update!
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg

[11-Dec-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Remember:
As long as you have the Ledger Recovery Phrase safe, your funds are safe in there.
Never share your Recovery phrase with anyone or upload it online.
Ledger doesn't support Komodo Active User Rewards.
Don't send any funds using your Ledger directly after 15 December 2018.
Once Ledger adds support for Sapling, we will announce it immediately. (re @Acura360: Komodo Sapling Upgrade - Important info for Ledger Users

[telegram] <Regnar> For anyone interested in donating some KMD to airdrop Venezuela, they now accept KMD donations. This isnt me or Komodo vouching for them, they are NOT an official Komodo project so please DYOR! Anyway here's the tweet adding support for KMD.

[11-Dec-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> they mention on their website Once we hit our goal of $1,000,000 USD equivalent, we will divide the total of each currency received by the number of recipients (100k) and credit the amounts evenly to each Venezuelan recipient's Airtm wallet. Amounts credited to Venezuelan recipients will be denominated in the currency donated for them to hold, buy/sell and send (as little as .0001) to others via email address. Airtm is covering all AirdropVenezuela administrative costs. 100% of donations received are sent to Venezuelan recipients.

[11-Dec-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> i wonder how much has been raised already and what sort of transparency is being given to the people who are donating

[11-Dec-18 10:31 PM] Regnar#6164
Looks like they've raised $113,621 USD so far, according to the bottom of their website (I assume it's just summing totals of the donation addresses) and they said they have over 250K users, but only just over 25K have met the requirement to receive some of the drop.  and as for meeting either recipient or funds goal it says "We are implementing a hard stop at 35 days from launch (11/27 - 12/31), with distribution starting 2/25
If < $1mm is raised: We will distribute the total value raised to 100k Venezuelan recipients.
If > $1mm is raised: We are placing a hard cap at $3mm USD equivalent / 300k Venezuelan recipients ($10 USD equivalent each). Any balance left over from the distribution of $10 to each Venezuelan recipient starting on 2/25 will be distributed to future Airtm Venezuelan users." 

I'm not sure on how we can verify who their "users" are, might have to do some research into that

[11-Dec-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
