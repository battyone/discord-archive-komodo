[telegram] <chmex> Hi Nate Check your internal ticket 52790 and I can get you the data you need. Or drope you email and I send you mine I m chmex on the kmd discort slack (re @blockfolionatew: Hi, I'm a dev from Blockfolio. I was wondering if an admin here could reach out to the dev team and ask for a recommended endpoint to retrieve currency pairs, prices, and if possible trade histories.  We're currently using this endpoint https://www.atomicexplorer.com/api/mm/prices to get currency pairs and prices, but the information from there may not be accurate.  Thanks.)

Komodo is officially interoperable. 

Not only are we the market leaders in atomic swaps (over 100K) so far, but we even have a method now to transfer coins between chains WITHOUT atomic swaps! (Chains must be properly set up.) https://t.co/jN7gz4iwl8

To make this tweet clearer, it means @KomodoPlatform did it’s smart contract transaction sending coins from one independent blockchain to another independent blockchain, WITHOUT ATOMIC SWAPPING!!
