[telegram] <Regnar> Not what you want to hear, but worth mentioning

[04-Oct-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yea I get that. This will change :) It’s not a finalized product, we focus on making the tech perfect, not on the liquidity on a non-KMD pair.

[04-Oct-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Or I can simply go to another Atomic Swap service with liquidity and no need in depositing funds (re @Regnar: You know you can make the order yourself right? You can post an order and become the liquidity)

[04-Oct-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> There is no other atomic swap service

[04-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Oh really???? (re @torsten1: There is no other atomic swap service)

[04-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Not true, there is one but with basically zero liquidity

[04-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Which one, I know at least three (re @torsten1: Not true, there is one but with basically zero liquidity)

[04-Oct-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> That is not true (re @torsten1: There is no other atomic swap service)

[telegram] <torsten1> I know about one other atomic swap DEX but they launched this week and they are even more beta than AtomicDEX (re @deepblock: Which one, I know at least three)

[04-Oct-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763

you are just moving funds from one wallet you control to another wallet you control in atomicDEX

[telegram] <deepblock> No, you don't have to. Source code is opened and that is true atomic swaps - I guess they are paying for fees themselves (re @torsten1: Never heard about Swap Online but considering you need to deposit your coins as a first transaction it’s not atomic that’s for sure)

[telegram] <torsten1> Anyway, yes, we are 200% aware that the success of AtomicDEX depends on liquidity. After the tech is working flawlessly, that will be our first, second and third priority. We are already working on it, and we hope to show you something very interesting soon.

[04-Oct-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> That’s fairly trivial to add and will do it for sure. If you check you will see that none of these services are mobile-first. That’s not a coincidence. Doing atomic swaps on mobile is notoriously difficult because of the networking layer. We decided to focus on mobile first and work our way back to web and desktop as those are rather simple compared to it. (re @deepblock: And moreover, it has ledger support)

https://liquality.io/faq/#howToFindACounterparty
```
How do I find a Counterparty for my atomic swap?
Liquality's cross-chain atomic swap Alpha interface does not have a discovery or matching mechanism. It is purely an execution and settlement interface for conducting atomic swaps, meant to eliminate counterparty risk and fees. Users should utilize their networks, communities, groups, and other means to find a counterparty and agree on a price before using Liquality's interface to execute and settle swaps.
```

[04-Oct-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't understand what you mean "depositing funds"? You are referring to AtomicDEX the wallet with built in DEX, but this is just a wallet that uses the AtomicAPIs. The APIs can be used by anyone within any wallet, even I have used them for my desktop wallet and some creative Python scripts. There's a few projects building desktop and website versions as well.. you dont have to "deposit" you just have to have a wallet that can talk to the API, which is open source (re @deepblock: Or I can simply go to another Atomic Swap service with liquidity and no need in depositing funds)

[04-Oct-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Thanks! 👍 (re @torsten1: I can maybe help with that. Komodo is a very tech-focused project, and it shows. It’s kinda “cold” like a server rack, it’s space technology but not very friendly for newcomers. Komodo is difficult to understand and explain. It is targeted to developers and enterprises.
AtomicDEX should be different, friendly, approachable, inviting for “normal people”. So we will change the messaging a little bit, change the design a little bit too, to make it, well, more approachable. AtomicDEX aims to gain millions of users eventually, it’s consumer product.)

[telegram] <Mr_Cryptodude> Is it true?

[04-Oct-19 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> There indeed is a listing cost to be onboarded the Atomicdex app. Projects don't have to use the AtomicDEX app to use the network, they are able to use the open source api and marketmaker to build their own apps or implementations of the DEX. The listing cost covers integration, maintenance, and security updates. (re @Mr_Cryptodude: Is it true?)

[04-Oct-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> There's no need for Komodo to reply to a toxic developer ranting about not wanting to pay a listing fee. In my opinion the more attention they give it the more attention Carsen gets. If you don't agree with the cost of onboarding your project to the AtomicDEX app then simply build your own and use the api for the decentralized network.

[04-Oct-19 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Oct-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I don't get why some developers would think they are entitled to get free listings when there is definitely a high cost of development and maintenace of a mobile app. If the cost is more than they can muster, then they can use the api to build out their own graphical interface or use a different gui like the hyperdex or chainswap.
