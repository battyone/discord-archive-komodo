[telegram] <Regnar> Reminder!!!! Admin will NOT escrow trades for you! If someone is claiming they have a Komodo or Komodo ecosystem admin to escrow a trade they are scamming you! We just saw someone claim to have me as escrow in a Pirate channel and then created an account to look like mine to pretend to be me and steal funds. I repeat, ADMIN WILL NOT ESCROW! If you want to perform an OTC trade use Barterlly, or post a trade on the DEX when it launches.
