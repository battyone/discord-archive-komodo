You still have a vulnerability in your mobile wallet, which allows keyboards to train their predictive typing engines on one‚Äôs passphrase. If one restores a wallet a few times, I have seen the keyboard learning the complete phrase and suggesting all the words in order as soon as you type the first one. And who knows how the keyboards treat those¬†passphrases. They might be saving them or sending to the cloud too‚Ä¶
