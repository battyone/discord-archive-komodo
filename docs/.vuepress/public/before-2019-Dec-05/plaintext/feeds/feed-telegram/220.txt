[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Zencash rebrand was last year, I think

[22-Feb-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Why would they? (re @PTYX11: Yeah, I think they are trying to distance themselves from the name)

[22-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I'm not entirely sure. I haven't had time to dig deepr (re @TonyStarkBR: Why would they?)

[22-Feb-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> interesting, i was surprised when i saw it a day ago. i had no idea. they kept the Zencash ticker though right? (re @TonyStarkBR: Zencash rebrand was last year, I think)

[22-Feb-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> I don't follow them, but it has at least 6 months... When I started following masternode coins, back in July, they already were named Horizen... Don't know the ticker (re @PTYX11: interesting, i was surprised when i saw it a day ago. i had no idea. they kept the Zencash ticker though right?)

[telegram] <Regnar> I think I've heard of someone saying this a little while back, I dont remember the reason it didn't have the shield tbh, it may have been a GUI bug. If it shows more than 1 confirmation, it has been notarized. You'll have more than 1 raw confirmations, but the main visible one only changes when it is notarized, basically an easy way for people to ensure it is as secure as possible. (re @TonyStarkBR: Btw, on v0.3.3, some of my transactions were not showing the shield even after several days, it started showing them after I updated to the latest version...)

[22-Feb-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Ok, thanks for your explanation!

[22-Feb-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Feb-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <PTYX11> We are a Komodo service provider. We onboard projects and offer them whitelabel software which they can use to launch their own apps. We did launch the ZILLA coin to distribute rewards, raise funds, and also to implement cryptoconditions. However, we didn't raise enough ico funds so we refunded people. Now we are competing for VC funds and our MVP is ready. (re @TonyStarkBR: What's the relation of Chainzilla to Komodo?)

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> The coin still exists? Do you're kind of a "token" running on Komodo's platform? (re @PTYX11: We are a Komodo service provider.
