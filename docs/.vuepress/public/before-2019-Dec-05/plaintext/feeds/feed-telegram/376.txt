[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> KMD is a lot different from ZEC at this point in time (scalability wise).
Actually, it's already one of the top performers in terms of TPS (re @BenkestokXBT: Hi folks, a question from a semi-techy person. Will the scalability problems that lead zec to build a completely new chain be a possible problem for the KMD chain (seeing as it is a fork of zec)?)

[27-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> 20k TPS has already been demonstrated, they're working towards 1 Million TPS

[telegram] <raleezy> I had Agama wallet on computer and have deleted it from my hard drive. I have also downloaded Komotdo QT, how can I see my funds/account now that I have new wallet?

[27-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Komodo's scaling is theoretically Unlimited, and its capabilities have already been proven. (re @BenkestokXBT: Hi folks, a question from a semi-techy person. Will the scalability problems that lead zec to build a completely new chain be a possible problem for the KMD chain (seeing as it is a fork of zec)?)

[27-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Use the same seed. (re @raleezy: I had Agama wallet on computer and have deleted it from my hard drive. I have also downloaded Komotdo QT, how can I see my funds/account now that I have new wallet?)

[27-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> But you should create a new seed and address, then send from old address to new address.

[27-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <raleezy> where in QT do I add new seed? (re @yorklab: Use the same seed.)

[27-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Habib_uk> Is the wallet available on android or ios

[27-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Oh sorry I forgot QT downloads blockchain that's different from the light wallet.

[27-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You would import your seed. But I am not familiar with the QT wallet,

[telegram] <yorklab> It would be much easier to use the verus Agama wallet

[27-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You don't need to download the blockchain.

[27-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
