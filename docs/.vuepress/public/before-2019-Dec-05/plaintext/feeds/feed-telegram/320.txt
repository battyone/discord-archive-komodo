[telegram] <Iv> Непопулярность А. Голубева среди населения, уже как естественное, но как отмечает его же окружение, слово ,,непопулярность,, преобразовалась в более жёсткие слова и связано это с различными скандалами в соцсфере из – за поступков и отношения Голубева к населению.
Что только стоит неуважительное отношение к ветеранам интернациалистам со стороны А. Голубева, о котором стало  известно на федеральным уровне.

[telegram] <BrokenBank> This still basically implies that reliance on people using KMD instead of their own currency has to happen for KMD to have any value (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3)

[04-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you ignore the spillover effect

[04-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we see it with PIRATE, where as it does well, people take profits and move it into KMD

[04-Jun-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
as any ecosystem coin does well, odds are very good that people in the ecosystem are doing well

[04-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and the coin at the center of the ecosystem is?

[04-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD

[04-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
via KMD you can go to PIRATE or VRSC or any other

[04-Jun-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is also the 5% per year, which by itself makes it on a pretty short list of the top 50 coins

[04-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
people forget that in open source, if you charge fees that are too high, then people will just fork it

[04-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so you cant really charge more than the minimal fees, which means forcing artificial demand will just be a short term effect

[04-Jun-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
we are after a long term permanent effect

[04-Jun-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
of hundreds of high quality projects in the ecosystem

[04-Jun-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
none of them obligated to pay a KMD tax, but where KMD is the path of least resistance

[04-Jun-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
many ecosystem projects on their own decide to help promote KMD, and during the high growth phase what is the most important, if it isnt awareness

[04-Jun-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
or we could charge a big huge KMD tax and get little to no adoption, but maybe it looks good on paper for those that dont understand the elasticity of demand based on higher prices

[04-Jun-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you believe that BTC txfees being $100 is a good thing?

[04-Jun-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Antara is the brand name of the framework and tools. Much like how different software companies name their software kits and products. Komodo uses Antara tools, Smart Chains use Antara tools.

[04-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JohDio> I think that’s a really valid argument, considering the overall race
To becoming a big ecosystem. The lower fees will play an importan part. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> people forget that in open source, if you charge fees that are too high, then people will just fork it)

[04-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
how were people feeling about paying $5 per ETH transaction?

[04-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and more to run the dapp?

[04-Jun-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the first reaction when you end up overpaying for something?

[04-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
to say, "hey this was great, lets do it again and again"?

[04-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or, "let me figure out as quick as possible how not to pay such crazy fees"

[04-Jun-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
granted things that dont get much usage, wont care too much about such things

[04-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <E> Cup and handle or inverted h and s in process. Komodo will fly now

[04-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so i expect that projects that dont get much usage would just use ETH and other high tax platforms, but projects that will get a lot of usage will want to be independent. and why reinvent the wheel, the engine, the transmission, the brake system, ... if you can just use antara to jumpstart your project and be as independent as if you spent 5 years developing the same thing?

[04-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and imagine more than one successful project in the komodo ecosystem.

[04-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there wont be a 1:1 spillover, but even if just a small percentage spills over, KMD benefits

[04-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is always the 5% per year no matter what

[04-Jun-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe KMD is the more stable price in the ecosystem as compared to the new projects, especially if they are starting from a low marketcap

[04-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <E> Very promising milestone. Shall open doors to next level

[04-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but with trading pairs all against KMD, KMD becomes the preferred coin to park funds in, especially since when using atomicDEX you can still collect the 5%

[04-Jun-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
what is unclear to me is why it is not clear to people that 0% komodo tax rate is the optimal for maximum ecosystem growth

[04-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mike> Well said boss😉👍🏾

[04-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are a high wage earner, would you prefer to live in a country (all else being equal) with a 50% tax on earnings or 0% tax?

[04-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and now we have a lot of high wage earners all in the same ecosystem, who will then come up with more ideas

[04-Jun-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and there will be goodwill toward komodo

[04-Jun-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
over years, this goodwill is something that becomes very valuable and impossible to obtain in any other way
