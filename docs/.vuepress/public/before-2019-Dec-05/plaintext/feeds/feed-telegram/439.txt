[telegram] <Caleb> I have a question regarding active user rewards... I have 979 KMD in my wallet. Lock time was 19 hours ago. I have only earned .1 KMD.

15% ‚Äì BOTS

Once fees are covered to kmd, how are they delivered.to DEX holders? Does a DEX holders need to actively claim? Is system active or hypothetical atm?
Is DEX a bit like an erc20 token, so that if you know my KMD address you also know the DEX address?
