[telegram] <N21_0> 1 BTC = 1 BTC
1 ETH = 1 ETH
1 KMD = 1 KMD
easy to understand i think

[12-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <threeridges> That is good on paper, reality is that USD still a reserve currency of entire globe for most of world trade (re @N21_0: 1 BTC = 1 BTC

[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Coinbase adding ETC?

[12-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <burfy174> Yep

[12-Jun-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <burfy174> Coinbase days are numbered anyway. Terrible fiat gateway due to restrictions and issues. I don't see this as a big deal

[12-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Yea but you think ETH holders receive ETC when it‚Äôs added?

[12-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <burfy174> No. They would have when the fork occurred in 2016

[12-Jun-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> But wasn‚Äôt it the same the added BTCH? Cause it wasn‚Äôt on Coinbase, then when they added it they gave all btc holder BTCH.

[12-Jun-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> I believe you mean BCH BitcoinCash    BTCH - Bitcoinhush on coinbase would be a big deal.

[12-Jun-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> I've used it a few times

[12-Jun-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mark> Several related problems, James. No matter how I prepare the UTXOs, I have a low success rate with trades, and I presently have several trades market 'Finished' in purple, but they are clearly hung

[telegram] <jamescheng25> so it is finished but the coin is not in your wallet?

[12-Jun-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> did you use the block explorer and check? sometime barterdex takes a bit to show the balance

[telegram] <mark> Will come back tomorrow. Don't wanna seem hostile, but just exhausted with wading through Youtubes and calculating UTXOs but still not being able to reliably trade. (My favourite crypto is listed on B-DEX, so we have an interest in figuring it all out!)

[12-Jun-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> ok, sure take your time. It definitely takes some learning curve ;)

[12-Jun-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> Hyperdex is more user friendly but not supporting as many coins as B-dex yet

[12-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mark> Well, such an admission goes a long way to helping me maintain my patience ‚Äî and really, my mob has a big interest in DEXes overall

[12-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> nice, which coin if i may?

[12-Jun-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mark> I'm gonna go out on a limb here: I'd like to see smaller-scale stuff that both works and has fine instructional material, than many-biggee-listings projects that are unnecessarily hard.

[telegram] <mark> I really am looking forward to HyperDEX.

[12-Jun-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> currently both DEXes depend on marketmaker version 1 , i hopefully marketmaker 2.0 will make everything easier

[12-Jun-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mark> And FYI, James, my mob is actually a trust-alliance of crypto geeks rather than members of one coin's community: a number of us are working over a number of DEXes
