[14-Apr-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I'm not sure what you mean. From what I understand, using the atomic labs tool costs a small fee which goes to atomic labs. (re @kirikou: I will recommend you yo read some reddit post about the origin of the fees while using atomiclabs.github.io. Then you will be able to decide properly)

[telegram] <kirikou> Not at all. Give me 5 min to post a link (re @PTYX11: I'm not sure what you mean. From what I understand, using the atomic labs tool costs a small fee which goes to atomic labs.)

[14-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Why do I have to pay a 5% fee?
Before we created this app there was no way to claim KMD rewards on a Ledger hardware wallet. Community members have been repeatedly requesting this functionality but no solution was available. We tried to raise funding for this but were unsuccessful.
As a solution we decided to build the functionality for free and take a small fee as payment. The fees will be used to fund future maintenance and further development in the Komodo ecosystem.
The fee is 5%¬†of the reward¬†being claimed. As an example, if you have 100 KMD and you are claiming 5 KMD in rewards, we will take 0.25 KMD (5% of the 5 KMD being claimed) as our fee. You will be credited with 4.75 KMD.
If you think the fee is too high (or too low), then¬†please let us know.
The code is licensed under MIT to be the most beneficial to the community. This means you are not legally prevented from copying the code and removing the fee. If you decide to modify our code to remove the fee or use an alternate version with our fee removed, we will not be able to sustain development on this project or others within the Komodo ecosystem. If you like the work we are doing, please pay the fee to support future development.

[14-Apr-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
