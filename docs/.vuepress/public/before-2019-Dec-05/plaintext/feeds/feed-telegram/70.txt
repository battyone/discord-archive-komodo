all the code changes are being done in jl777 and dev branches, but the external stats sites track changes to master. having master branch changing all the time is not such a good thing as it means either a lot of testing work is being done for master release qualification, or that it isnt.

[telegram] <Regnar> indeed. We need some more twitter followers to go to this post and like all the Komodo tweets under it. There are plenty of other people suggesting Razer to "check out" projects, but show little information as to HOW that project will help Razer, or what they can offer. So I posted links directly to Komodo resources and how they will help Razer. So go in there and like all the posts.
telling someone to "check out" a project is pointless when a project is so expansive, we need to bring the relevant information to them
