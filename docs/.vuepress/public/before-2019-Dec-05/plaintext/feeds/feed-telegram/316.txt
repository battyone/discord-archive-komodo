some confusion about DEX. some are expecting some major launch to happen in the next hours. it wont
we will start with a controlled beta
this gives us time to make sure it is as solid as it needs to be for a wider scale beta
after that, we will be able to know when we will be ready for a major launch
it is not as easy as you might think it is

[31-May-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes then say

[31-May-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
since it is not ready for mass release yet, what do you want marketing to do?

[31-May-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the tech is done as ca333 promised. a new version is being built now

[31-May-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
we are developing in the open, but that means people will see things before they are announced

[31-May-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
we could develop silently and not say anything at all until it is done

[31-May-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
we are in the "getting all the pieces together for a full release" stage

[31-May-19 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
not in the "time for marketing to promote it stage"

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is also prudent to make sure the release is as stable as it needs to be for a more wide scale release, hence the beta test

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes then announce when ready none of the bs next week of other next week ok when we ready

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
until you hear marketing announce it officially, just ignore it

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Same with the branding

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
there are people that have tested in during the alpha and beta stages, some of them made some public statements

[31-May-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but those are not official things

[31-May-19 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
also, we need to scale up over time to the hundreds of thousands of users level of usage

[31-May-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
dont expect that to happen on any single day, it is a process

[31-May-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Ok marketing team should handle things better working with devs

[31-May-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so you want us to have a top down hierarchical corporate structure where marketing controls everything?

[31-May-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that komodo is an open source project??

[31-May-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i probably have leaked info way ahead of time in my blog at jl777.com, but hardly anybody reads it so i guess it doesnt matter so much

[31-May-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i know everybody is very excited about all this, i am too. but this has been in iterative development for literally 5 years

[31-May-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
from the controlled beta release to a more widespread beta to initial production release to massive number of users

[31-May-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how long that will take to achieve, but we are at the controlled beta release stage

[31-May-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tutupa> Are we talking about weeks? months? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> not sure how long that will take to achieve, but we are at the controlled beta release stage)

[31-May-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> I hope not months hard enough waiting for a year

[31-May-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Or five for some

[31-May-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
to ramp up to massive usage, that will take more than weeks, surely

[31-May-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but to get to initial production release, we just need to have a smooth beta test

[31-May-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Reminder!!!! Admin will NOT escrow trades for you! If someone is claiming they have a Komodo or Komodo ecosystem admin to escrow a trade they are scamming you! We just saw someone claim to have me as escrow in a Pirate channel and then created an account to look like mine to pretend to be me and steal funds. I repeat, ADMIN WILL NOT ESCROW! If you want to perform an OTC trade use Barterlly, or post a trade on the DEX when it launches.

[telegram] <BrokenBank> How does staking reward work as supply increases?? Is there a deflationary metric I can look up to better understand the reward structure?

[01-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The rewards (not staking) does increase supply, but only if people claim them. Exchanges that hold millions of KMD dont claim and don't increase supply. But rewards will stop at block 7777777 (re @BrokenBank: How does staking reward work as supply increases?? Is there a deflationary metric I can look up to better understand the reward structure?)
