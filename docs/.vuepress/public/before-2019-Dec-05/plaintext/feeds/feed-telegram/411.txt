[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: I'm curious if Binance is handling transactions that don't have locktime set. The rewards only accrue if locktime is set, Ledger I don't believe sets it on outbound transactions (all Komodo ecosystem wallets do set this) and so the transaction wouldn't accrue any rewards, so Binance may not have given you any more than the 7.
I'm guessing the first rewards airdrop Binance did was not the same as reward accruing. They probably just distributed past earnings to everyone who has a balance (I think they even said if you had even 1 KMD you would get rewards) but that isn't how the Komodo rewards works

[12-Oct-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> ^^^ (re @LATOSHII: I did got reward but its 25x lower than what am supposed to get from dex . 5% annually ?)

[12-Oct-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> KMD Staking distribution will be calculated as follows: 
KMD generated by each user = Total KMD staking rewards received by Binance * User KMD holdings ratio. 
User KMD holdings ratio = User KMD holdings / Total KMD staked by Binance.

[12-Oct-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay so. If you had 100 kmd, and binance has 1000 kmd total, you have a KMD holdings ratio of 10%
If binance gets 4.25 kmd per month, you get 10 percent of that

[12-Oct-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think the problem here is that user KMD holdings doesn't mean it is always gaining KMD, because rewards only accrue if Locktime is set and the utxo is >10 . So you could have a bunch of smaller KMD holders (less than 10), or deposits without locktime set, not accruing rewards, that are receiving a cut of the total rewards gained by Binance.

[12-Oct-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't know for sure if Binance us doing this, but you gain more rewards with your coins off the exchange because of some reason of how Binance distributes rewards.
