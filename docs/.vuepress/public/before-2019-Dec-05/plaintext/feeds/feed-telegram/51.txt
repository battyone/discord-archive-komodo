[telegram] <JtheLizzard> I typed komodo and it sayd no project found (re @CryptoVitamins: So do we type ‚ÄòKomodo‚Äô or Komodo platform?)

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <benohanlon> did it work when you put komodo platform? (re @JtheLizzard: I typed komodo and it sayd no project found)

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> I type Komodo and it worked

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> it says to use the coinmarketcap name, so I guess "Komodo"

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> asking for "/position Komodo" works too

1-If you haven‚Äôt done so, make sure you sign-up to KuCoin. You will need your KuCoin account email address in order to vote.
2-Project Name You Want To Get Listed (spell the name in full, DON'T USE THE TICKER)
3-Make sure you spell the name of the project correctly as it appears in coinmarketcap (if is not listed on coinmarketcap spell the name just like it is written in the whitepaper)
4-You can check position and number of votes for any projects with the following function:
/position Komodo (re @Quesho89: I couldn't vote yet... I've already started a private conversation with the trading bot but what about now?)
