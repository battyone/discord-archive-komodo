I have updated the master branch of my repo with the annual update

[15-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that starts a process where final tests are made (we were testing beta all last week)

[15-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and when passed, the komodoplatform repo is updated

[15-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
at that point exchanges will be notified

[15-Jun-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
eta is today to start notifying exchanges

[15-Jun-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
in spite of the hack and refund process, the team meets the accelerated schedule! this is because i didnt have to do much at all for this release cycle, the team is grown big enough where all aspects there are others than me to handle things. i didnt have much time at all due to having to deal with the hack

[15-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Will we be seeing a komodo agama release again at some point?

[15-Jun-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
agama will live on, details will be announced soon, i think next week

[15-Jun-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
live on

[15-Jun-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Thanks for the update (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> agama will live on, details will be announced soon, i think next week)

[15-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Great to see team growing stronger! üí™ About Agama, I personally really liked it but how are you going to have robust enough testing in order to make sure such attack cannot happen again of have even slightest chance? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> in spite of the hack and refund process, the team meets the accelerated schedule! this is because i didnt have to do much at all for this release cycle, the team is grown big enough where all aspects there are others than me to handle things. i didnt have much time at all due to having to deal with the hack)

[15-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> And thanks for the update! üëç

[15-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
this was indeed a wake up call and we need to definitely improve in this area. there really is no excuse for what happened, that is why i took personal responsibility for it. we will need to slow down the release process a bit and not rush things out, despite users clamoring for new updates

[15-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
we also of course, need to be much more aware of upstream attack vectors

[15-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Yes sounds like reasonable actions. And why abandon Agama when it is pretty tailor-made for the ecosystem use.. Just need to put heavy emphasis on security aspects of the releases. üëç

[15-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> i think a lot of people would now like to see Ledger support for Agama. I know I would

[15-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Octavn> Another question please. How many TPS can komodo afford?

[15-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> As much as it needs

[15-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Octavn> Any value?

[15-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Octavn> They don't know?

[15-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sreinhardt> Komodo has an interesting technology which can dynamically link in parallel sidechains that are interconnected, giving a vast array of different tps ratings depending on what an application requires. I forget the numbers exactly but they have shown demos running from thousands to hundreds of thousands of TPS sustained. Maybe more. There were talks of larger demos but I can't remember if they were carried out. It's actually hard to generate that many TPS for a test case. (re @Octavn: They don't know?)

[15-Jun-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
5.1% if you compound it monthly

[15-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Jun-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810

KMD will be the default trading pair for the atomicDEX

[15-Jun-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
as such it should have the highest liquidity

[15-Jun-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810

1 day left until the long awaited Binance pump.
The active member count is a lot higher than we expected. However, it is still a bit lower than the high times of BPS. With the current member count we can expect a great pump. Inviting more people will result in an even bigger pump. So, post about it on social media, forums etc.
Tomorrow we will explain our strategy.
