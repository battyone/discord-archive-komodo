[telegram] <Regnar> It's going to be a whole new product line designed for a specific industry as well as refining current capabilities to make building on Komodo insanely easy. And much more! (re @xarux: What awaits us after rebreding?)

[15-Mar-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> As soon as it moves volume, it is true that there is little interest in Komodo. You need a raise up to $ 5 and lower it again up to $ 2 ~ to get attention.
Do not do competitions or something?

$KMD is setting up a massive bull flag, this thing is going to run past ATHs soon! ATH is 11 fiat, which will definitely be surpassed! I see this like I said before going to $ETH numbers of 2017! #Rebranding #comingsoon #cryptocurrency
