[telegram] <omboti> And nothing happens when oI clicked trade

[30-Oct-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> I looked at my history

[30-Oct-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Did you notice that your 2 switched to a smaller amount first?

[30-Oct-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> History is for completed trades, "orders" is for current trades either open or being executed (re @omboti: I looked at my history)

[30-Oct-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Yeah I pick the very top

[30-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Btw 2 swaps was successful but I don't remember the process i select

[30-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes and that should change the values based on the price and the available trade volume at that price. Then you click trade. It will say confirm trade details and you click confirm (re @omboti: Yeah I pick the very top)

[30-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> But for sure from the order book

[30-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Yes that what i did (re @Regnar: Yes and that should change the values based on the price and the available trade volume at that price. Then you click trade. It will say confirm trade details and you click confirm)

[30-Oct-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> So the very top is the best price to swap at the moment?

[30-Oct-19 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes, but may not have the most available volume (re @omboti: So the very top is the best price to swap at the moment?)

[30-Oct-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> What do you mean? When you click trade it should say 0/3 and begin the process (re @omboti: And nothing happens when oI clicked trade)

[30-Oct-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Yeah i noticed that

[30-Oct-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Than will increase to match status? (re @Regnar: What do you mean? When you click trade it should say 0/3 and begin the process)

[30-Oct-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes.

[30-Oct-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Ok so i clue is the order at the top is the best offer

[30-Oct-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> When it matches with the other person it will say 1/3. It's peer to peer so when you click someone else's order to fill it, it still has you communicating with them that you are matching their order (re @omboti: Than will increase to match status?)

[30-Oct-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes, and it will auto fill the volume if the best price is below your desired swap amount (re @omboti: Ok so i clue is the order at the top is the best offer)

[30-Oct-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Yay i have 3 matches transactions lol

[30-Oct-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nice!! (re @omboti: Yay i have 3 matches transactions lol)

[30-Oct-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> So there are no partial order match! Either we take the order book or just put our order book

[30-Oct-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Partial fills are supported (re @omboti: So there are no partial order match! Either we take the order book or just put our order book)

[30-Oct-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> I onlybtrade morty and Rick test now

[30-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Why is  transaction in and out in both assets different

[30-Oct-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There are a series of transactions being made, these are part of the Atomic Swap

[30-Oct-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> I just place an order of 2.22 morty to 2.22 rick

[30-Oct-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Can u see it?

[30-Oct-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> ;) (re @omboti: Can u see it?)

[30-Oct-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yup

[30-Oct-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> i eat my own order

[30-Oct-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> ? (re @omboti: i eat my own order)

[30-Oct-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> And it should be a match status .. am i correct?

[30-Oct-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Means previously I sell morty and Now I buy morty 2.22

[30-Oct-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Lol um no idea if you can swap to yourself, as the end result would just be you having the same coins, minus the fees. There might be an issue with that when it comes to the atomic swap though, considering it's the same address lol. Well, let me know what happens üòÖ (re @omboti: Means previously I sell morty and Now I buy morty 2.22)

[30-Oct-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Nothing happens ... no step 1/3 in m order tab

[30-Oct-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Give it a bit, I don't think anyone tested swapping to yourself lol (re @omboti: Nothing happens ... no step 1/3 in m order tab)

[30-Oct-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> Yeah ... but it might happens in error ... when someone did not reliazed lol

[30-Oct-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> And at this moment 3 best offer infront of the my "2.22" order

[30-Oct-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> 4 match 4 timeout and 2 failed status in my history tab

[30-Oct-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea this seems abnormal to me, I have 100% success rate. You should go to the discord, they may want you to send Logs (re @omboti: 4 match 4 timeout and 2 failed status in my history tab)

[30-Oct-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omboti> I am in discord but I never use thi app lol

[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Lol

[30-Oct-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Also, ‚Äústress test‚Äù is a bit misleading. You can‚Äôt do a stress test with humans :D A stress test is a million swaps per hour. This is a bit different: it is mostly to test as many individual configs as possible. The networking layer is really delicate, especially on mobile data. Some swaps will fail. And that‚Äôs great, that‚Äôs all very valuable info.

[30-Oct-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Not quite what you said. You said we should have a trading competition for marketing purposes. You said
"We need marketing and amazing products out on social media and tv" and 
¬†"100000 omg give away" etc.
Which this is not. This is a way to incentivize as many configurations as possible, in a short amount of time. Not really a trading competition, it's basically a raffle with trades being your ticket. You could be insanely unprofitable and win this competition. (re @Bar_Harbor: Would help the test of AtomicDex)

[30-Oct-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Also no one laughed at you.

[30-Oct-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I said I don't think a full scale trading competition is a good idea while we're still in Beta, and still think that. If we raise a bunch of money for the prize pool, market it like crazy, and bring in tons of new traders, and the app can't handle it, we'll likely never be able to convert those traders long term. Best wait for full scale marketing/trading competition for after it's put of Beta.

[30-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Wow!!! Your other admin was fucking name calling before that too.. say what ever you wanna say but I said we need marketing on every scale even for atomic dex

[30-Oct-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Oct-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
