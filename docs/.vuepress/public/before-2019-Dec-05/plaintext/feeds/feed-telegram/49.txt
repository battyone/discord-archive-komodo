[telegram] <shuruiz> Btw, I don’t agree the point that KMD community is more educated than others

[10-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <shuruiz> They’re almost equal because people seldom put their eggs in one basket

[10-Jul-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> more than u think, especially after the altcoins bloodbath last few months i think majority has consolidated to 2-3coins t most

[10-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <shuruiz> I don’t want to argue about that. I don’t care about the market price.

if you can use unix cli, we have a 2000KMD staking contest for -ac_staked=100 chain we are testing

[10-Jul-18 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
first round was for 1000KMD and we had a lot of excitement and learning and also fixed all the issues, so round 2 should be much smoother.

[10-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> oh yeah i predict big future for crypto, but what projects will survive and thrive is a different story, u just make you best bet and wait. If i lose miney in crypto no sweat

[10-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <shuruiz> I agree

[10-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> If you have any questions let us know (re @shuruiz: Maybe you’re right. I’m a researcher. I care more about technology part. I buy KMD because I found dPoW is interesting.)

[10-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <shuruiz> lol thanks. Currently no. But maybe I’ll encounter some in future (re @polycryptoblog: If you have any questions let us know)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Regarding lightning network,  Komodo will have its own implementation via Chips.  Onchain and offchain swaps have different use cases

Looks like Cryptohumor is jumping on the Bancor meme wagon. Maybe we should like the post (for all you instagram users) and comment some stuff about Komodo, BarterDEX, HyperDEX and atomic swaps. with komodo you don't "leave your coins in a DEX" you simply trade from a wallet you own, not out on some website, or a wallet you "own" hosted somewhere else. Right there on your computer...

[telegram] <icoexplorer> Once you get into crypto I don't think you can ever truly find peace.. It's always there and you know it. 
I purposely leave my phone at home when I got out.

[11-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> How do people get ahold of you then?

[11-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> I tell my Mrs who im with and what time to pick me up. Or if I am getting a taxi home. 
I spent much of my life without a mobile so it's not that hard. When I was young I had to knock on my friends and hope they were in.
I hate people getting hold of me.. Which is  why my phone is always on silent, I prefer to call people on my own terms.

[11-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> To be honest I don't go out if I can help it,  much rather be in cryptoland

[11-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Yeah I get what you mean people think they have access to a person because they have their number

[telegram] <icoexplorer> Especially with the double tick thing. You there? You seen my message? What's up? You ignoring me? Answer your phone!.... Most younger people don't know the world without  constant contact.
You go to see a friend you haven't seen for a while and if your both on Facebook lots you already know what eachother have to say.. I went on holiday last month..  yea I saw the pics..
I have no social media anymore, except twitter for crypto.
People are just trying to outdo eachother all the time and desperately hunting for likes to get their dopamine hit.

[telegram] <Bushybro> I have a question/rant.....why the hell are these coins created with so many decimal places but you are never allowed to withdraw your total amounts from these damn CEXs.  This pisses me off to no end

[11-Jul-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bushybro> Why are the 8 to 16 decimal places not supported when it comes to withdrawals?  You end up with all these small amounts everywhere that you can't do anything with

[telegram] <Bushybro> Forwarded from PTYTrader: If you have 500 or more KMD yes. However, you will need to export the privatekey of that particular address using an offline tool

[telegram] <Dolladollaiv> Thank you. I have been trying to export from my ledger to my agama on my laptop thats running windows 7. Have had some problems syncing. Waiting for the blockchain to load to try again.

[11-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bushybro> Good luck, I had my KMD on a ledger and when I saw how complicated it was I just moved it to agama....😅 (re @Dolladollaiv: Thank you.
