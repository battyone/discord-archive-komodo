[telegram] <Crypto> If i have my coins in agama, can i claim my rewards everyday?

[18-Jul-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> Sure. You can claim them anytime you want, as often as you want

[18-Jul-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> Every 5 minutes if you wanted

[18-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> That would not help you collect more interest tho, the only thing it would do is add the coins to your actual wallet balance

[telegram] <Crypto> Ah okey

[18-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
