[16-May-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Why do you think they are worthy of a response

[16-May-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
they call us not decentralized. with that level of silliness how to take it seriously?

[16-May-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
especially when they have masternodes that could be majority controlled

[16-May-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Then let it be known, it not that hard if given the level of inaccuracies, the truth is users wont be able to tell the difference at this point, why not help them understand yes technical individuals can deduce differences but not the average user who wants a Dex

[16-May-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> When that average user sees that chart they are not thinking masternode is controlled by majority, also isn't that why you have writers/PR in the team?let them do their job especially if they are paid to do so

[16-May-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> KMD is not focused on marketing, they are focused on development - this has been said many times over

[16-May-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if we had to spend time to correct all the lies out there... what would we have time left for? also, engaging with them would elevate them to our level. let them try to stand behind their fancy chart that says we are not decentralized, among all the other nonsense

[16-May-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
remember any press is good, so their goal is to get us to respond, so they get free press

[16-May-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-May-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Just my thoughts on things

[16-May-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
officially responding just gives them free press

[16-May-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you feel so strong about it, you can personally make fun of them

[16-May-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> I don't I am diversified don't know which is which so il play safe was hoping a writing about it will bring clarity

[16-May-19 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> I‚Äôd be more than happy to write an article about KMD, the only thing is that I‚Äôm not technically savoy in the ways of blockchain..but maybe that‚Äôs a good thing because I will break it down in layman‚Äôs terms? Or if I write a piece someone from the team could proofread it?

[16-May-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly feedback can be provided if you write something up!

[16-May-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Because you see this one chart this one time and think we should write an article or press release correcting it, we see this tactic all the time. Other projects will write something about us to egg us on to write about their projects and post it to our site or official Twitter. We don't have enough time in the world for the team to officially respond to everything any project says, the best we can do is build up our reputation and image so that when people see stuff like that they know it's silly. That means focusing on what we do best and writing about that. (re @Ra: Then let it be known, it not that hard if given the level of inaccuracies, the truth is users wont be able to tell the difference at this point, why not help them understand yes technical individuals can deduce differences but not the average user who wants a Dex)

[16-May-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-May-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes however there are only two known acknowledged DEX kmd and BLOCK, KMD has a multilateral focus BLOCK focus is singular, dont think you can ignore that , "most"companies that have won always have a singular focus then dominate other market , Google, Microsoft, even Binance  etc. it nothing to do with me or my opinion it just empirical observations, however I appreciate something is been done about it,

[16-May-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
