[05-Jul-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It isn't anywhere based. It's a DEX, decentralized exchange. Just as Bitcoin isn't based anywhere, it has nodes and miners everywhere, AtomicDEX has nodes everywhere. A true test of a DEX is if someone can block an IP address or User, or is "based" somewhere, it's probably not a DEX (re @Cryppto: Still. Under what jurisdiction AtomicDEX is? It is a US-based DEX?)

[telegram] <Cryppto> Some legal entity must operate the website, right? That legal entity must be under some jurisdiction, right? (re @TensaZangetsu2: Dex mean Decentralized. No have home so its not in US)

atomicDEX does not work via a website

[05-Jul-19 06:34 PM] jl777c#5810
just like a decentralized coin does not work via a website

[05-Jul-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> From my understanding, AtomicDEX runs from the AtomicAPI which is protocol for the Nodes and market maker. So you having AtomicDEX app on your phone will use the AtomicAPI, just as me writing a python script on my computer, or another wallet app or program that makes API requests and posts, can interact with a node or make a node using the AtomicAPI.
Even the orderbook is decentralized using a torrent protocol. So anyone using the protocol, no matter the app, program, or website, can interact with it (re @Cryppto: Some legal entity must operate the website, right? That legal entity must be under some jurisdiction, right?)

[telegram] <Cryppto> I need help. On June 10, 2019 I deposited some KMD to my Magnum Wallet. (More than 10 KMD). When I tried to claim the reward today, I got a message showing zero claimable reward. What I am doing wrong? I thought Magnum Wallet set the locktime field automatically. This is not true? How do I set in Magnum? Should I claim a zero reward for a fee of 0.0001 KMD just to have the locktime field set? How do I know it is set?

[telegram] <Regnar> Depends on the sending wallet to set locktime (re @Cryppto: I need help. On June 10, 2019 I deposited some KMD to my Magnum Wallet. (More than 10 KMD).

[05-Jul-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Magnum should set locktime on "send" transactions, but if you sent to Magnum from a wallet that doesnt set it (binance, Bittrex, coinomi etc) you will need to send to yourself to set it

[05-Jul-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> OK, I see. The exchange I bought KMD did not set the locktime. So, what now? Can I send my KMD coins to the same KMD address in my Magnum Wallet? (re @Regnar: Depends on the sending wallet to set locktime)

[05-Jul-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yup! 
"Generally, transactions from an exchange do not set nLockTime, so if you received funds from an exchange, with nLockTime not set, awards will not accrue. To overcome this, the easiest method is to send the funds to yourself from within Agama. When we say "send the funds to yourself", it means from your address in Agama, to that same address"
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024428-komodo-5-active-user-reward-all-you-need-to-know (re @Cryppto: OK, I see. The exchange I bought KMD did not set the locktime. So, what now? Can I send my KMD coins to the same KMD address in my Magnum Wallet?)

[05-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> When you "claim" all it's really doing is sending a transaction to yourself

[05-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> So I lost one month and now have to pay 0.0001 KMD transaction fee just to have the locktime set. OK.

[05-Jul-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Substitute "Agama" with any wallet that DOES set locktime, Magnum included

[05-Jul-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Unfortunately yes. There is always a TX fee for claiming, but coins also must have locktime set, otherwise there is no way to tell how long the transaction has been accruing. We've been trying very hard to get all wallets and exchanges to implement it by default, but because it's unique to KMD, most opt for the simplest solution that requires the least work. (re @Cryppto: So I lost one month and now have to pay 0.0001 KMD transaction fee just to have the locktime set. OK.)

[05-Jul-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So the next best thing is to try and educate users of the parameters that must be set. And always recommend using supported wallets

[05-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Understood. I'll survive this financial loss... üòÇ (re @Regnar: Unfortunately yes.

[05-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> So I sent it to myself in Magnum. Got it confirmed. How do I know for sure locktime is set? Can I see it somewhere in the explorer?
