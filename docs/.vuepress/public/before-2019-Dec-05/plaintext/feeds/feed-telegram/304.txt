[24-May-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Currently there appears to be SPV server problems, which could affect your wallet seeing your coins, and may appear as 0. You should use your seed and check that your address is the same as it normally is (if your address is different then you have made a typo in your seed) if it is the same and coin balance and transaction history isn't showing up, check your address in a block explorer.
