[telegram] <Regnar> I'll try and keep the non discord users updated with information.

[05-Jun-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Verus mobile is good too. Don't import your seed into Verus Mobile or Verus Agama. You should generate a new seed with those wallets and send funds to them. Remember to backup your new seed as well

[05-Jun-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> What is up with with this verus version of agama. I literally made a seed almost twice the length as my old seed and it still says my seed is weak

[05-Jun-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> I’m close to writing a book for my seed now

[05-Jun-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DanielSulMiners> safu!

[05-Jun-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> For your seed? Or password? (re @changemymindk: What is up with with this verus version of agama. I literally made a seed almost twice the length as my old seed and it still says my seed is weak)

[05-Jun-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Seeds should be randomly generated to be strong.

[05-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Seeds are generally 24 words long, and are comprised of specific words according to specific BIP standards.

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> I didn’t in my last two wallets that I made like 2 years ago and they had over 24 words. It won’t let me with this one.

[05-Jun-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> Keeps saying too weak so I guess I’ll randomly generate one

[05-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> This seed doesn’t make any sense it’s like a bunch of random words with spaces. I wanted to make my own

[05-Jun-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That is how a seed is supposed to be. Non random seeds are MUCH less safe (re @changemymindk: This seed doesn’t make any sense it’s like a bunch of random words with spaces. I wanted to make my own)

[05-Jun-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out
Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> This is from discord ^^^

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> I suggest sending your funds to a ledger

[05-Jun-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Use the web wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Think of it this way, seed phrases are directly tied to your public and private keys. If you make up your own seed phrase you're building private keys that someone else could make up, or stumble upon, because we don't think randomly, especially when we try to make a seed "make sense". Passages from books, addresses, birthdates, sentences, are all guess able. Which severely weakens your private keys to known attack strategies. 
Stick with randomly generated, write them down

[05-Jun-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> What about Chameleon pay app (re @Regnar: Verus mobile is good too. Don't import your seed into Verus Mobile or Verus Agama. You should generate a new seed with those wallets and send funds to them. Remember to backup your new seed as well)

[05-Jun-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think Chameleon is good. I'll reach out to Chainzilla and confirm. (re @BrokenBank: What about Chameleon pay app)

[05-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kolobus> If you used freshy Agama wallet with that wallet - it's not safe (re @CryptomanXX: What is going on with Agama? I have my wallet for over a year am I effected?)

[05-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Might just transfer to binance until I get confirmation on situation

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> That's what I did for now

[05-Jun-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Already ordered a ledger nano so waiting on that to arrive

[05-Jun-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kapscedric> verus agama lite mode don t reach the server and it s impossible to connect spv server

[05-Jun-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Done too. 120 transaction confirmation needed for binance deposit. So takes awhile (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: Already ordered a ledger nano so waiting on that to arrive)

[05-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> It's not a permanent solution (re @kapscedric: verus agama lite mode don t reach the server and it s impossible to connect spv server)

[05-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kapscedric> ok

[05-Jun-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Better idea is to send it to a ledger nano
