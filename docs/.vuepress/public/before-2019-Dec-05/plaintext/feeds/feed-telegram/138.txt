[telegram] <Cryptocries> what if i keep accumulating regularly, how to calculate then ? my question is, if i have 100kmd in day one, but on day 3 i buy another 100kmd, and again buy 100 kmd on day 5,then if i claim reward once a month, when should i start calculating ? from day 5 or still day 1? (re @Regnar: To put it simply. With 100 KMD, if you claim once a month, you'll get 99.9968% my theoretical max. If you claim once a week, its 99.6130%, if you claim daily though, its only 95.3702% the theoretical max! 
Not to say dont claim daily, because you may have to if you make transactions or receive some, buy more etc and they aren't over 10kmd utxo or dont have nlocktime set then you should claim them to set the rewards etc. But yea looks like monthly is best, weekly is a close second, daily is lagging.)

[21-Sep-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FilippoE> Its calculating second per second from hold

[21-Sep-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You can do it, I think you'd just want to do compounded interest for the initial amount, plus the future value of a series. 
I dont think itll change what the optimal claim rate is though, just a hunch (re @Cryptocries: what if i keep accumulating regularly, how to calculate then ? my question is, if i have 100kmd in day one, but on day 3 i buy another 100kmd, and again buy 100 kmd on day 5,then if i claim reward once a month, when should i start calculating ? from day 5 or still day 1?)

[21-Sep-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So I'm thinking, if you make scheduled deposits of 10 KMD a month (120 a year) ending balance would be 122.78 ending balance (5% rewards). This is less than 120 up front and claiming once a month (126.13)
So it should just be the compound interest for intial amount + Future value of a series (which is compounding itself at the same rate) (re @Cryptocries: what if i keep accumulating regularly, how to calculate then ? my question is, if i have 100kmd in day one, but on day 3 i buy another 100kmd, and again buy 100 kmd on day 5,then if i claim reward once a month, when should i start calculating ? from day 5 or still day 1?)

[21-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryptocries> make sense. anyway ill just keep claim 3 times a month (re @Regnar: So I'm thinking, if you make scheduled deposits of 10 KMD a month (120 a year) ending balance would be 122.78 ending balance (5% rewards). This is less than 120 up front and claiming once a month (126.13)

Like for 100 kmd, 105.109 monthly, youd get 105.101 (re @Cryptocries: make sense. anyway ill just keep claim 3 times a month)

[telegram] <OriginalBitcoin> Heads up to the KMD community.  I decided to try the CRED app after hearing on this chat that they were offering buy $10 KMD get $10 of KMD for free.  It has been a nightmare so far.  I made a purchase for $20 and they debited my bank account on the same day. However, that initial purchase took over 10 business days to complete and that was after I got on their case about why the transaction was still pending. Then I found out that you cannot move your Komodo to your KMD wallet.  You can only move USD which means you have to sell your coins.   So I submitted a sell request 12 days ago which is still pending and no money has been deposited back to my account.  On top of this there is a $5 monthly fee.   Disappointed in the KMD team for recommending such garbage.  For others out there, don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. Stay clear of Cred

[telegram] <Regnar> I cant speak for CRED, I'm not a rep for them or anything but from what I see their payment processor is Plaid which is pretty standard in banking and fintech apps. So Plaid authenticates account data which makes ACH transfers easier/faster but pulls from your account (not plaid or CRED) are still processed by ACH. Which does take days (kinda why we're all in crypto) so no surprise on the wait time there, companies like Coinbase have insane amounts of USD and Crypto which they basically front you the amount for the days while the backend transactions are actually happening. CRED probably doesn't have that money yet.
I'm not sure what you mean move Komodo to KMD wallet, but I dont have the app. I dont know what they do with sell requests though. But 12 days seems like a lot. (re @OriginalBitcoin: Heads up to the KMD community.  I decided to try the CRED app after hearing on this chat that they were offering buy $10 KMD get $10 of KMD for free.  It has been a nightmare so far.  I made a purchase for $20 and they debited my bank account on the same day. However, that initial purchase took over 10 business days to complete and that was after I got on their case about why the transaction was still pending. Then I found out that you cannot move your Komodo to your KMD wallet.  You can only move USD which means you have to sell your coins.   So I submitted a sell request 12 days ago which is still pending and no money has been deposited back to my account.  On top of this there is a $5 monthly fee.   Disappointed in the KMD team for recommending such garbage.  For others out there, don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. Stay clear of Cred)

Focus Fire: Komodo (part 2)
Security is, and has to be, the top of the list for any blockchain technology that hopes to last for any amount of time. Without security, no bells and whistles will compensate for rampant double-spending via 51% attacks and compromises in the integrity of data.
