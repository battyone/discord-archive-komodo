[telegram] <mo7881> Here is a question - would it be technically possible to do an atomic swap on a z-  transaction with 2 Komoco asset chains. Also What happens if you get a Merkle Tree of all z-only assets are they interoperable?

[10-Mar-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I believe the answer to both of your questions is yes. But the real experts hang out in Discord, you can ask there. (re @mo7881: Here is a question - would it be technically possible to do an atomic swap on a z-  transaction with 2 Komoco asset chains.

[telegram] <Sergio> KOMODO ECOSYSTEM AIRDROP / GIVEAWAY 
Not spam
Hey guys! For those of you who know, OPay/OCryptoUnion has recently onboarded on to the Komodo platform. 
Utilizing Komodos existing contracts as well as blockchain, they have developed a platform for crypto loans (Similar to Salt/Nexus) and by doing so, also have introduced a very important aspect to Komodo.
KSB (komodo debt backed stable coin) No more shitty tether with their unredeemable tokens, or printing like banks.
KSB will be powering ZADDEX, a DEX which will list komodos ecosystems coins. KSB allows any coins (komodo ecosystem or not) to be traded and be used as a fiat gateway. Ultra low fees, KSB is redeemable for FIAT instantly by bank.
OCU is also working on a launchpad, with a partnership with Africas biggest Stock market exchange, they aim to help fund start up companies in Ivory coast, start a VC, and a whole lot more.
Think of O crypto Union as the head, with many branches like their launchpad, dex, stable coin, loans, vc 
I know a lot of posts get buried under the constant talks here (and I love it) but for those of you who are looking into a coin, this is one to keep an eye on.
Total supply of around 130m, trading at 1c, it is currently at around 1m marketcap, tiny considering what they have already achieved, and with @Fabien_√ò  CryptoUnion $KSB $OUR_  leading the project (formerly worked at goldman sachs), 
his vision is to create something amazing with the tech komodo is providing.
I would like to help spread the love to my fellow komodians. Some of you got my KMD airdrops in the past cough @Caglio 
I would like to further donate to the amazing community that komodo is
I am giving away multiple lots of 15,000 OUR simply message me, leave a comment, or engage in some talk and I will send them to your komodo address smiley OUR is accessible on Agama.
