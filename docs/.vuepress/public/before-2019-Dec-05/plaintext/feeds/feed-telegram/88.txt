[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Yea if anything it will be the next ETH but better (re @smokinhot: Who thinks komodo is the next btc)

[04-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo never had the intent to replace Bitcoin, that's why we notarize to it ;) Komodo offers different solutions than Bitcoin and while some overlap (currency) we have a lot of unique capabilities that complement the whole ecosystem.

Many users have asked us how to get to know when to sell positions at stop loss signal.
Here is our solution: 
Always try to adjust your stop losses manually and subject to stabilization below the indicated level.
Some traders use trading bots which are good solutions to this issue as these bots wait for the bigger candles to close under the stop loss level and if stabilized, they try to sell at best prices possible.
There has been many cases that only the wick of the candle has touched the stop loss and bounced back and even reached our sell targets, but for our signal accuracy we count them as losses in this report for our new traders not to get confused.
Trade safe with Cryp2Club!

still a few dice specific bugs, but the rest appear to be pretty solid from the testing results. it is still at cli level, but the contracts are native contracts and run at full speed and have full access to the entire blockchain history
