about 12 years is about 12 years

[28-May-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> Sorry i thought you said it had to reach block somethingsomething, and THEN goes to 0 in about 12 years (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> about 12 years is about 12 years)

[28-May-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kracken> So between now and 12 years, the roi continues to decrease. Is that decrease fixed?

[28-May-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it does NOT change

[28-May-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it stops in about 12 years

[28-May-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not complicated, it is very simple

[28-May-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
5% per year until it stops

[28-May-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to claim monthly to maximize it, i guess it ends up at about 5.1%

@S2bbb make sure you have the seed backedup
then, can you clear cache/local data and try again?

[28-May-19 03:19 PM] SHossain#0007
Clearing cache should help

no need to clear data first time
