[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Not even a theory. Binance disabled the kmd wallet, price proceeded to go up from that point. Thats a fact.

[09-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Well a lot of things happened. It also coincides with the start of the marketing efforts in China and the launch of Komodo‚Äôs WeChat (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Not even a theory. Binance disabled the kmd wallet, price proceeded to go up from that point. Thats a fact.)

[09-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I never disputed that (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Not even a theory. Binance disabled the kmd wallet, price proceeded to go up from that point. Thats a fact.)

[09-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Not you Regnar

[09-Nov-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Also the publication of KMD as the top5 pick by an influencer w 75k followers

[09-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo didn't disable wallets, or even ask that they be disabled (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Not you Regnar)

[09-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Also with the AtomicDEX test

[09-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Exactly. In fact, we did not know Binance will disable it this early (re @Regnar: Komodo didn't disable wallets, or even ask that they be disabled)

[09-Nov-19 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That isn't our job, that is the exchanges job. Some are disabled now for the update later, some aren't. That is what the exchange does to prepare for updates.

[09-Nov-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Just in the last 2 weeks: AtomicDEX test, start of marketing in China, influencer endorsement, Dune (a Tezos spin-off) licenses AtomicDEX for their securities token product

[09-Nov-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> But yea 1 out of the 10 exchanges disabled the wallets too

[09-Nov-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> All this on a very favorable market

[09-Nov-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Kinda common sense, nothing shady about it. If you give a bunch of people coins on an exchange, and they don't want to hold them, they will sell them. They took reward funds Binance was sitting on and gave it back to traders. Literally EVERYONE expected price to drop because of it. And now deposits and withdrawals are disabled in preparation of an update and price goes up, and you think something shady is happening? Both cases are simple supply and demand (re @EPIDEMIC_media: First Binance does a staking airdrop where the price tanks 50% and now the price is up nearly 40% on the week with deposits and withdrawls suspended. Definitely some shady shit. You can play it off as buyer interest all you want.)

[09-Nov-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Didnt say you were. But to act as if a tweet is the cause more than binance disabling wallets is just shillboy talk

[09-Nov-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay now I have zero idea what you are referring to (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Didnt say you were. But to act as if a tweet is the cause more than binance disabling wallets is just shillboy talk)

[09-Nov-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> My view is that the China marketing has a huge role

[09-Nov-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Komodo never did any marketing in China, now we are on WeChat and we have all the latest articles translated and circulated

[09-Nov-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Lennart> nice effort please continue üòéüëç (re @torsten1: My view is that the China marketing has a huge role)

[09-Nov-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I just explained how this is common sense and not some conspiracy. If wallets are enabled and price is significantly higher than it is now, we will likely see some more sellers. If it's lower, probably nothing will happen. 
This isn't a conspiracy, it is common sense. Stop making it out to be something else (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Lets see what happens when wallets are enabled. If the price tanks convienently before wallets are restored then may the conspiracy theories fly)

[09-Nov-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Btw Korean and Japanese are coming too, the AtomicDEX site is already translated

[09-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> also kmd tanked considerably more, dropped from around 50th CMC to almost 80th spot..? we're now just around where we used to be

[09-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> I said right before tho, but ok (re @Regnar: I just explained how this is common sense and not some conspiracy. If wallets are enabled and price is significantly higher than it is now, we will likely see some more sellers. If it's lower, probably nothing will happen.

[09-Nov-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> It's not exactly a secret either that Komodo, unlike many projects (not all, but many) does not use market making services. That means KMD is usually more volatile than some other assets. Dumps more and pumps more.

[09-Nov-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Looking at all these fractional coin orders in the trade history, if KMD doesnt pay first party for market making services, someone else is doing it on their behalf. (re @torsten1: It's not exactly a secret either that Komodo, unlike many projects (not all, but many) does not use market making services.

[09-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> People use bots for sure. But Komodo itself doesn't employ market makers (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Looking at all these fractional coin orders in the trade history, if KMD doesnt pay first party for market making services, someone else is doing it on their behalf.)

[09-Nov-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Stockwinner> just only  a first stage for big increase as ETH was done before .

[09-Nov-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Yeepp (re @Stockwinner: just only  a first stage for big increase as ETH was done before .)

[09-Nov-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Bots are a part of pretty much every exchange, and usually aren't exclusive to a single coin pair. Just check out the POST API documents of each exchange, API keys are available to every trader. Though they usually stick to certain volume coins to avoid liquidity issues (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Looking at all these fractional coin orders in the trade history, if KMD doesnt pay first party for market making services, someone else is doing it on their behalf.)

[09-Nov-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Which is also what makes the Atomicapi so important. It not only allows anyone to integrate atomicdex into wallets and apps, it also let's people like me and others write bots for trading

First AtomicDEX Stress Test Successfully Completed - Komodo
Komodo held a community stress test of AtomicDEX Beta on 31 October from 12pm to 6pm GMT. The test provided the Komodo Development Team with an enormous amount of valuable data about potential bottlenecks in the networking layer, and will help the Komodo team perfect AtomicDE...

[09-Nov-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mixic> Komodo will announce the next phase of stress testing as soon as the DEX is ready for a full-scale scenario, in which multiple trading pairs will be tested while automatic spam clients bloat the network. Such a test would have different objectives than the previous test. The test next will focus on the overall trading experience, as opposed to the load-test of the recent test.

[telegram] <Regnar> Anytime exchanges disable deposits and withdraws it will mess with prices and arbitrage opportunities, meaning you'll see bigger price differences between exchanges because traders can't move to the higher price exchange and sell. This is expected and naturally going to happen as exchanges work on wallets.

[09-Nov-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Yes, Binance is trading with a premium compared to Bittrex and Huobi

[09-Nov-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
