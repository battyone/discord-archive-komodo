[telegram] <Regnar> haha yea well I have a membership to Piktochart which definitely helps with them but still have the learning curve. Not sure it's worth the money I pay for it though :/ (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <Meyse> i really like this one though. i still think my own stuff is shit alot of the times:D)

[30-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Meyse#0952
i would just buy a copy of affinity designer. you can make those blocks etc yourself pretty easily and just keep looking how other people do it.

[30-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Meyse#0952
keep copying styles and eventually you will get your own;)

[30-Jul-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> haha yea maybe. I'm definitely NOT passionate about building these. But I figure as an individual I need to step my game up and help Komodo in any way I can and noticed no one shared a graphic of any kind yet, also throw my reference link in there ;) (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <Meyse> keep copying styles and eventually you will get your own;))

[30-Jul-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> which has shown me there's 27 link clicks and two sign ups, so 7%. Not terrible, not great. idk wtf an OODL is though haha

[30-Jul-18 12:27 PM] Meyse#0952
7% is actually pretty good imo

[30-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea not too bad. on Twitter its got 940ish impressions which is good so far, through link clicks are about 2% of impressions, which I think is on par for other times. Not too bad.

[30-Jul-18 12:32 PM] Meyse#0952
maybe those 2 sign ups are big whales xD

[30-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> haha yea maybe. I'm hoping my tracking method is just not as reliable. hopefully there are people seeing my post and going around my link and the actual sign up rate is higher. I get that it's a reference link and people don't like that, but there's no good way for me to track if 900+ impressions are translating to anything tangible.

[30-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> and from what I've learned of marketing, if you can't measure the results of a marketing plan or promotion, it's pretty much useless.

[30-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> for example, I asked people to comment below when they voted, and only one comment... no idea if it's the person who voted either haha

[30-Jul-18 12:38 PM] Meyse#0952
if people click on your ref link and they sign up whenever, it will count as a signup for you

[30-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea that's what I mean, I can see the sign ups from the clickthrough, but I was trying to track the effectiveness of the tweet by other means too (comment below) which hasn't been accurate at all haha

[30-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Meyse#0952
ah right gotcha, you cant track everything when its not under your control

[30-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nope, but it's good to see the number climbing for votes anyway, so there's others seeing other posts and going to vote.

[30-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ostalakar> @regnar has far I know, ref link are not allowed. You ned to say it clearly

[telegram] <Michael> Question: what is KMDs end goal with atomic swaps? 
The problem I think of is a store that accepts crypto. Well there's 1000s. So will atomic swaps be used for making this easier...example, store has BTC wallet. I have KMD. Thus during the transaction an atomic swap occurs so the store gets the payment in BTC...

[30-Jul-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo notaries actually build a natural resistance to ASICS if I remember right. The use of ASICS will strengthen the 
mining network without the threat of centralization of mining power.
