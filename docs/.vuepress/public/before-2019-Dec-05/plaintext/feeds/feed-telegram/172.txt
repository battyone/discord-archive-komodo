[telegram] <BrokenBank> There used to be a mobile version...I can't find it anymore. Is it only the web version now? (re @Regnar: In case someone was looking for a wallet as a browser extension, this link is to Guarda, a 3rd party wallet who has integrated KMD. Their web wallet and desktop also allow KMD rewards to be claimed, I think rewards in the extension are coming later.)

This includes having both transparent and private transactions that are protected by zero knowledge proofs. We will also use the same trusted setup as they do.

[telegram] <coinsmash> Hey Guys, I wrote an article about recent updates on the Komodo platform. Thought I would share with this group. Let me know for any feedback you may have: https://coinrivet.com/komodo-platform-is-in-the-final-phase-of-its-re-launch/

[14-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Not that I know of. Komodo does have forms of "governance" when we have notary node elections which has voting taking place on chain through the casting of VOTE coins which are KMD asset chains airdropped to everyone before elections. Notary nodes will campaign for positions and try to show how they will bring community benefits if elected etc. Notary nodes do not control the mining of blocks (though they do mine) there are mining pools and individuals as well, notaries perform notarizations to BTC, which the Komodo network can survive just on our own PoW if we needed. 
As for chain changes, these are generally done by mining power. Pushing a hard fork doesn't have to be accepted but the updates have been safety ones and not political. Komodo and jl777 have a history of not liking when Dev teams push mandatory updates that break stuff for community members like what happened with NXT. It's also probably worth mentioning that if you were deciding on a fork decisions, it's best to stick with the notary nodes as they are the ones performing dPoW functions which make KMD extra resilient to 51% attacks. 
Komodo development is open source and available on github, and discussions about topics are in public channels in Discord. There are also Komodo "employees" who are paid by community members, jl777 and other lead Devs to perform more focused roles for Komodo like chief marketing officer etc but these roles are also volunteer based too (I'm a volunteer :D )
So as for governance in official capacity, I dont think we'll see one that can force changes, freeze stuff, reverse, or other wise do centralized type actions. (re @BrokenBank: Thanks for the info.... Any info on a governance model in the pipeline for KMD?)
