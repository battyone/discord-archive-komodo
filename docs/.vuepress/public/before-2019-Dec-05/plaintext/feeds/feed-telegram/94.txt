not sure I would call it amazing user friendliness if people are confronted with source code, and this explains how there are contracts that are just braindead as when youhave non-programmers essentially making code changes... well, it ends up badly at times

sure, no disagreement. but code snippets doesnt seem very user friendly. unless you mean having cartoon characters along side the code snippets makes it user friendly?

[09-Aug-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
having non-coders doing code is dangerous

but important , easy to start

with the CC contracts, it is a matter to issue rpc calls to start a contract. so it doesnt require coding

[09-Aug-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but if your usecase isnt covered by an existing CC contract, then a custom CC contract needs to be written

[09-Aug-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is similar to ASIC mining vs CPU mining. more work to make the ASIC, but once created it can do all the related things much more efficiently

[09-Aug-18 09:47 AM] firedragon#9195
ok , can wait for the CC contracts . once out , hope x 200 in a year

if only combine the two

[09-Aug-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes KMD solves the cryptokitties scalability issue, but someone has to write the cryptokitties CC contract

[09-Aug-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
which is mostly independent of the blockchain as it has the kitties DNA logic that seems to be most of it

future KMD price depends on overall crypto marketcap

[09-Aug-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can predict that, then I can predict a future KMD price. Historically KMD is a bit under 0.1% of overall crypto marketcap. Assuming KMD price rises in CMC to top 10 level, then it would be closer to 1% of overall crypto marketcap

[09-Aug-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
