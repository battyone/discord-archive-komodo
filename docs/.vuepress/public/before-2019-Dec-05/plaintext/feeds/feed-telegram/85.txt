[telegram] <Regnar> roughly yes, the BTC that was raised is actually almost completely dedicated to dPoW notarization costs. Since we notarize to Bitcoin blockchain, those funds are so we can notarize loooooong into the future without having to worry about buying BTC at market prices. 
Komodo "ICO" was actually mostly a token swap from BTCD, in which BTCD holders were able to swap to KMD at a set rate. This is because JL777 and many of the BTCD developers wanted to move to a Zcash fork for better privacy for users. (re @razvan07: ico raise 2 mil usd)
