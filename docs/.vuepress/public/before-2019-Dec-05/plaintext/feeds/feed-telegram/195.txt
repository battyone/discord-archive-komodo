[telegram] <Seko> That is the comment from JL777 himself:
‚Äûwe havent done ERC20 on lightning. years ago i did what I call subatomic swaps, which were incrementally transferring value 1/777th at a time. It was really no big deal, so I didnt make any press release out of it. I didnt like the performance aspect as it required 777*2 small offchain transactions to complete and anything goes wrong during the process and things are left in an inbetween state. with a normal atomic swap, it either happens or unwinds so that it is as if it didnt happen. so any claim of atomicity when using lightning would need to have caveats, like it isnt actually atomic if the channel fails, or is closed, etc.‚Äú

Please update your Agama to latest version 0.3.1d from our website. If you have been using version 0.3.0, it is recommended to update to this version which comes with some bug fixes and latest Komodo binary. Download Agama version 0.3.1d from here - https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/
There are Installer version as default now and portable versions at alternative download page.
Keep using this version as this is sapling ready. Please don't use any version older than 0.3.0 as those are not sapling ready and send any tx using those version will not confirm on mainnet from 15th December.
If you have funds on any z address, please wait for further announement after 20th December. You need to migrate your private funds to a sapling address. We will announce guides to do so and the required zmigrate dAPP.
Please keep your wallet.dat and private keys safely backed up to ensure your funds are safe. With the hardfork there is not going to be any chainsplit, only one mainchain. If you keep using this version you will be on the main chain and your funds are safe as long as you are in control of your private key or wallet.dat file.
If you are a Ledger user please checkout Ledger's announement regarding our Sapling upgrade https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013635173
If you can't send your funds or don't want to send your funds to Agama, don't worry, your funds are safe. Anytime you can use those funds to send or claim reward securely using an offline computer. Read our guide here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026860-komodo-sapling-upgrade-important-info-for-ledger-users
Please report any critical bugs if you find and any suggestions to make things better. Thanks for using Agama.
