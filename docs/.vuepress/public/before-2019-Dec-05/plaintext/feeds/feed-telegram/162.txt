[27-Oct-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bushybro> My advice to anyone have issues with their wallet, first and foremost please verify you are using the latest wallet version.  If you dont check on your balance often it's more than likely you are a few versions behind.  When you copy/paste your seed, verify there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end.  You can do this by deleting the first letter and putting it back in and do this also with the very last letter in the seed.  Third, know which mode you are in.  Either it's native or spv.  Native mode dowloads the whole blockchain and you have to backup the wallet.dat file.  Spv mode only requires that you enter the same seed each time which brings you to the same address every time.  I have been using agama since January and have been been able to fix any issue with these 3 steps.  Good luck and HODL hard.

[27-Oct-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bushybro> Just always remember, if you are the only one having the issue, more than likely the issue is on your end.  The admins Are the first to let us know if there is a bug.  And even with that, there has never been a bug where your coins disappear.
