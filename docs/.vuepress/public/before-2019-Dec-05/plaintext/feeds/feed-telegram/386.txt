[telegram] <Cryppto> Screenshot from Coinexchange. DEX/BTC market. Something is wrong here. The available supply is 191542290.51000000 DEX. I think there is a mishmash in tickers. There is some other coin that uses DEX. Meaning, CoinMarketCap data are wrong, applying to some other coin/token.

[telegram] <yorklab> Something to keep in mind: The volume/price increase has happened without any whales getting involved to push up the price. So Komodo's potential is now getting out in the crypto space.
