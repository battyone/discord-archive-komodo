First public beta will be soon.  Personally have demonstrated it this past week at a blockchain week private event and to several projects.  On a side note , if you think it appears that blocknet may be ahead of us it‚Äôs only because we are coming up from behind after lapping them. üòâ)

[telegram] <TropicalMiner> u mean my public address right? (re @TropicalMiner: ye am waiting for the sync to finish - hoping for the best but given those where my addresses before I dont understand what gone where etc)

[17-May-19 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you had always used lite mode then I don't think native mode will do anything. You need to be 100% sure your seed is right, case sensitive and space sensitive. (re @TropicalMiner: ye am waiting for the sync to finish - hoping for the best but given those where my addresses before I dont understand what gone where etc)

[17-May-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It helps if you remember your original address and can see if the address in your wallet is the same. If you have a single mistake in the seed (like an extra space, or a capital letter) the address will be different. 
If you sent funds from somewhere else like Binance, go to binance and see what address you sent them to, and look up that address in the block explorer. If it has the balance and is a different address than what you're seeing in your wallet, you made a mistake putting your seed in.

On $USD pair: Still within the range. Breakout upwards is 100%+ possible run towards next resistance.

On $BTC pair: Do you really want to sell at 2 year lows? Best one is when we break downtrend and make a HL.
