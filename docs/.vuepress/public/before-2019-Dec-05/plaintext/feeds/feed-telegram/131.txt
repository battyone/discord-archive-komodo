[telegram] <Crypt0kin> Can someone give an overview of what is happening in the komodo community (here is my attempt): Hyperdex is being finished up (not sure of release date), coincollect will be using barterdex as a backend (seems they will be accepting fiat), chainzilla is developing an awesome exodus alternative (using agama backend), komodo will surpass other projects on TPS, etomic allows for ethereum tokens on barterdex. What am I missing? Too much is going on with this project (which is a good thing).

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Other chains are reaching out to use DPoW to protect against attacks,  first batch of smart contracts released( dice, token, reward )MoMoM / CC will eventually allow for cross chain contracts.  More integrations with cryptoproducts like ATMs and voucher systems.

[telegram] <ca232> Anyone keeping an eye on network hashrate? I switched from mining KMD for a few months, fancied a gamble on some shitcoin moon missions. I came back to KMD yesterday- was surprised to find my returns are right down, but I can't find historic hashrates. If the hashrate has spiked, this is bullish- right?

hashrate is approx double historical levels, due to ASIC

[14-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ca232> Got it, thanks. So not necessarily greater grassroots bullish sentiment from a large population of miners, which was my assumption. If small miners like me (one rig of 1070s) get pushed into being unprofitable and switch off, leaving transaction verification in the hands of fewer farms with higher hashes, what's the impact on security? Would be less decentralised, no? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> hashrate is approx double historical levels, due to ASIC)
