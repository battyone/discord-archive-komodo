You can stake Komodo and get rewards in your wallet and get around 5.1% per year

[06-Dec-18 07:43 PM] Hermes#6934
Here is a quick overview guide of how this is done https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000026742-claiming-reward-overview/en

[06-Dec-18 07:44 PM] Hermes#6934
that one is for mobile users.

[06-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> you don't need to stake, the reward is automatic. Just claim once a month or it stops accruing

[06-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> If you want to claim the reward you should keep the KMD in a wallet that gives you access to your private keys and supports the software ...keeping your KMD in an exchange or a wallet that doesn't support this feature ...easiest way is using Agama to hold your KMD ,

[06-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> I think that what Komodo World is trying to clarify is that you don't need to keep your wallet online to get the reward..that's the difference between staking and the reward claiming that happens in Komodo  automatically...they are similar but for new users...it's a way to see the similarity.

[06-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Also guys ...the team is making  new guides that are Interactive for new users specifically...it shows how the user can use our applications before downloading them.
