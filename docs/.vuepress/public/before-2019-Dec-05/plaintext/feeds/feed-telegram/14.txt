[telegram] <Hermes08> the official release

[15-Jun-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boot_Leg> Thanks Ben (re @benohanlon: Best wishes to everyone celebrating Eid al-Fitr and the end of Ramadan. Eid Mubarak!)

[15-Jun-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <and1> if the fees were cheaper than at binance would certainly come many traders

[15-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <and1> 0.1% fees with bnb coin 50% disscount (0.05% )

[15-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Binance charges both sides most likely and also not so many users have the bnb coin , I haven't used it

[15-Jun-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Also I wouldn't trust much centralized exchanges because they don't give you the private keys of your address.

[telegram] <CryptoVitamins> Everyone complaining about marketing.. Retweeted this from regnar or comment on it. When you've got a decent group talking about us, we need to amplify it. Use our network effect. For fks sake 1 million tx/s.. No wonder we don't move, there's so few likes people think it's just vapor ware and move on (re @Regnar: CALLING TWITTER USERS!!
Getting some more outside KMD publicity. This isn't an advertisement for Cryptocollective, but a way for us to have a show of force in social media to drive outside content providers to check out KMD and display it to their followers. These guys have about 3600 followers on their Twitter and are about diverse coin content which means their followers are likely looking to them for additional coin info. They have an additional 7K followers on instagram, presence on LinkedIn and have ICO reviews and research stuff. So if we show support for KMD on their tweets ABOUT KMD then it's likely they'll tweet more about it and share on more of their social media platforms and potentially pitch it to their clients.
So go like this tweet, comment on it about what you love about KMD, what you think of the project, what type of content you want to see more of (KMD ;) ) tag your friends and other crypto pages and retweet to your followers.

[16-Jun-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes confirms its a wallet

[16-Jun-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just like any wallet, it needs to confirm

BTG is 10minutes like BTC?

[16-Jun-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so maybe up to half an hour

[16-Jun-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JakeWorc> Yeah, i have 18 confirmations on chain now but still nothing.

[16-Jun-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
are you using electrum?

[16-Jun-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe try to restart barterdex. you wont lose any funds as long as you have the passphrase, you can get the privatekey.

[16-Jun-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JakeWorc> electrum mode in barterDex yes

[16-Jun-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763

at 1 to 3 confirmations, with the new ASICS coming, an exchange will be guaranteed to lose money to double spends. Why such a big deal to wait 2 hours for deposit. Just plan for it instead of waiting till the last minute. If the actual notarization lag is used for exchange confirmation, then it could be reduced to about 20, but that requires changing the exchange deposit processing to be based on more than just number of confirmations.

there  is no need to fight. barterDEX is just one part of KMD ecosystem and by its nature there will be many DEX and room for all of them. barterDEX supports BLOCK and hopefully BLOCK supports KMD

[16-Jun-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
I think BLOCK uses the PIVX microservices support and is offering meaningful things other than DEX and compared to many projects it is far more real. of course I am not aware of any scaling or security or cross chain contracts support from BLOCK, but that is not the area they are doing
