[telegram] <Shena> New logo or will  same?

[30-Jun-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
new logo, same name

[30-Jun-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> This is HUGE! Will this work for other blockchains that are secured by KMD DPOW ? (re @yorklab: Some interesting posts from JL777 about the impact to Komodo (and KMD) from his new discovery today:
"getting notarized SPV security at API wallet speeds
basically the best of both worlds
both speed and security can be achieved. essentially nSPV node would be very very close security model as a full node would be"
"you tell me. it applies only to komodo based chains that are dPoW notarized
it wont work with non-dPoW chains"
"yes, 1000 chains wanting dPoW is not so crazy and if each buys 10k KMD so they cover annual notarization costs via the rewards...
it is a big if, but at least in the realm of possible, if we can get a lot of ecosystem projects")

[30-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> For example if GameCredits wanted a new lite wallet could they use they use the nSPV?

[30-Jun-19 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
additional work would be needed to add nSPV extensions into the daemon

[30-Jun-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
having dPoW makes it just a matter to add the required extensions. also addressindex would need to be supported in the daemon

[30-Jun-19 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so possible, but would require more work on the daemon

[30-Jun-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Nice, so we can now run atomicDex on a smart watch :P

[30-Jun-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet

[30-Jun-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but theoretically, it seems it is indeed possible

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> Next year you'll just need to say "KMDBTC 100" snap your fingers and the swap is done

[30-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zeehenk> Does this new technique also give value to kmd or is it a separate thing?

[30-Jun-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be able to scale to millions of users

[30-Jun-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
using superlite wallets, no blockchain sync, not even headers sync

[30-Jun-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just a few seconds to be ready to submit tx to the mainchain

[30-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zeehenk> That's really a great step towards mass adoption!

[30-Jun-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Zeehenk> Not just for kmd but crypto as a whole

yes, it is a good problem to solve

[30-Jun-19 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
now we need to implement it

[30-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Spookedcook> Hmmm what will the new logo be

[30-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <serenetictrance> Yeah, wallet was a bad one..But in my head I don't categorize / associate the wallet with the coding of the coin, KMD itself..Completely different languages / groups (re @jcooperman: Unless you forget to security audit walletsüòÇüòÇ)

[30-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <serenetictrance> And the group that saved it was the group behind the coin itself, which makes an even stronger case for KMD imo lol

[30-Jun-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> 100% agree

[30-Jun-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763

i recommended to buy PIRATE with the 5% rewards, a few months ago when it was 0.03 KMD

my prediction was that all privacy coins will be removed from all the major exchanges

[01-Jul-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it was too big a risk for KMD, with such small zaddr usage

pirate parties are existing in many countries

[01-Jul-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
pirate gains far more attention with its name than it loses

[01-Jul-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
name recognition. name 3 privacy coins that you know about

[01-Jul-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if PIRATE (or ARRR) makes the list of three, then that is most of the battle as far as mindshare goes

[01-Jul-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
use the meme to get remembered, use the tech to get a new pirate

[01-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Spookedcook> Dont worry, im not upset, I also know you can't be right always. Just find the whole komodo losing privacy odd. But its fine, I still think komodo is the best and you are the reason. nSpv sounds cool

[01-Jul-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
since truly decentralized cross chain atomic swaps cant be stopped (short of stopping all users), the latest regulation guidelines specifically say that non-custodial DEX is not subject to money transmittor licenses. the proxy based DEX does not appear to have the same status

[01-Jul-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
when we add support for PIRATE to atomicDEX...

[01-Jul-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> what would be the way to anonymize funds using Pirate? Is it enough to do just a z-z transaction? Or should multiple z-addresses be generated and smaller chunks sent to each address?

[01-Jul-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> Pirate in Atomic Dex would be very, very powerful indeed

[01-Jul-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
necessarily the PIRATE swap will be via z -> t (swap p2sh) and t (swap p2sh) -> z, so the party you trade with will know the zaddress and amounts. that by itself wont do much good as zaddr are not onchain. however if you make exchange deposits or purchases via the same zaddress, then it become possible to correlate. so, swap only from a special zaddr that you use only for atomic swaps, then do a z -> z for all proceeds. that makes all the funds part of the giant anon set that is 20x more than ZEC anon set
