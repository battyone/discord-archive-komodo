[telegram] <Regnar> But considering Komodo (including its community, developers, etc) is a decentralized project, I'm sure if people WANTED to pay for KMD listings on a specific exchange, they could certainly raise donations independently to do so! But Komodo funds that were initially raised won't be used that way.
I'm personally not against listing fees (assuming they are reasonable) (re @klimenko85: Thanks. I thought so. I just need this information for further distribution.)

[29-Nov-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> For example if you know of a really good small exchange that caters to a certain region you want KMD to grow in, or you think would be a good fit, it might make sense to try and raise money to list there.
But the ICO funds are allocated almost entirely to paying dPoW costs.

[29-Nov-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <klimenko85> Of course, the fee for placement on low-liquid exchanges for Komodo is unreasonable.

[29-Nov-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea though if that exchange dominates a specific country's crypto trading market, it might be worth it. But not out of the Komodo dPoW funds. dPoW is far more important (re @klimenko85: Of course, the fee for placement on low-liquid exchanges for Komodo is unreasonable.)

[telegram] <unknown_star> guys  staking on my trezor starting Sunday. Is it natural to have zero rewards on Friday?

[29-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> its not just staking. You need claim your coins. From hardware need connect to KMD wallet and make it. I saw atomiclabs on github but dont know it works with trezor too

[29-Nov-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <unknown_star> i have zero coins to claim from Sunday. does that sound right ? (re @TensaZangetsu2: its not just staking. You need claim your coins. From hardware need connect to KMD wallet and make it. I saw atomiclabs on github but dont know it works with trezor too)

[29-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <unknown_star> I did connect it

[29-Nov-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> depends how many KMD you have on trezor. Its 5% year so its small number from small amount coins and I heard is minimal limits to  take coins I think hm something like 10 KMD ? you have 10 kmd? I guessing number not remember for 100% sure

[29-Nov-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <unknown_star> yeah... i got zero KMD since Sunday.. so something has to be going wrong. @t_dan check pm when you have a min pls (re @TensaZangetsu2: depends how many KMD you have on trezor.

[telegram] <Regnar> Check your address here
https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards
I would also use the link about to check your address to make sure rewards are accruing. Locktime (the method of measuring how long rewards are accruing) is set on outgoing transactions, by the sending wallet. Some wallets just don't set this so the coins don't accrue rewards.
If this happens you can send your balance to yourself to set the locktime.

[telegram] <Him_Vichiet> I am not sure if it's locked or not

[30-Nov-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TensaZangetsu2> few days ago they allow deposit and withrawal. Its dont matter anyway soon all exchanges should make update and all works. No need hurry or strange panic sometimes; )

[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Bittrex is the only one thats open Im aware of, but its trading at a lower price than Binance. (re @Raja_MBZ: Guys where can I trade KMD right now? Most exchanges have their deposits and withdrawals locked for KMD.)

[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: Pretty sure it was said the update will be released by end of Nov. The update is available and it's still November. "Can we expect to trade freely within..." I assume you mean on a specific exchange that hasn't updated yet? Did you ask that exchange yet?

[30-Nov-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> ^^ but go off (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Originally the admins said by Nov. 30th or earlier the wallets would be enabled. But if you ask them now they will deflect to the exchanges and get angry for holding them accountable for their previous statement)

[30-Nov-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: To anyone reading, this is me kidding with Acura, we do not control exchanges, their wallets, or how quickly they update. The code is available for them to update with. They are notified. Yes, the update was released on schedule (by end of November).

[30-Nov-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> EPIDEMIC is just always mad that admins in a Telegram channel don't have the ability to make Binance use the code available to update their wallets and enable deposits and withdrawals

[30-Nov-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Seriously dude. The code is out. The exchanges CAN update, and are notified. It is still "End of November". Deadline met. Go bug the exchange to hurry up

[30-Nov-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I and every other admin here has no ability to make Binance update their code or open deposits (they could have already done it, just haven't opened deposits)

[30-Nov-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Dude, you can be technical and try to spin it all you want. People just want a basic crypto functionality to be available. It isnt that much to ask. I will go bother binance although I doubt I'll get a concrete answer from them either.

[telegram] <Regnar> "Basic crypto functionality to be available" 
You do know the entire Komodo network is up and running right? All our wallets work. We are testing new things everyday. We are notarizing to Bitcoin every block. Thousands and thousands of addresses are claiming rewards without issue.

[30-Nov-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> Just a question if I stored kmd on paper wallet... Can I still get reward

[30-Nov-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes. You have to claim it monthly though if you want to maximize rewards (re @efmartinez: Just a question if I stored kmd on paper wallet... Can I still get reward)

[30-Nov-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> Alright thanks

[30-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Rewards are more based on the sending wallet. The sending wallet sets locktime on the transaction, so it will accrue no matter the type of wallet it is in. However some wallets do not set locktime on their transactions by default. I think Coinomi doesn't. But MOST wallets do, and EVERY komodo ecosystem wallet does

[30-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> What I mean is paper wallet

[30-Nov-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So even if you get a transaction that isn't accruing rewards, you can send the transaction to yourself.

[30-Nov-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Do you mean sending from paper wallet? (re @efmartinez: What I mean is paper wallet)

[30-Nov-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> Yes

[30-Nov-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> Sending to paper wallet n keep it there for a while

[30-Nov-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes this is what I mean, if you send FROM a wallet besides Coinomi, to a paper wallet, it will accrue rewards (re @efmartinez: Sending to paper wallet n keep it there for a while)

[30-Nov-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> Thanks clear

[30-Nov-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> And then when you claim monthly, it all depends how you send from the paper. You likely import the key into some wallet to spend the coins.

[30-Nov-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So importing into Agama, Chameleon, Magnum, atomicdex, pungo etc would be your best bet, then send it to a new paper wallet

[30-Nov-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> OK.

[30-Nov-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But yea, paper wallet will accrue rewards, but claim it monthly to maximize rewards, and when you claim, use a Komodo ecosystem wallet so it will keep locktime set (re @efmartinez: OK.)

[30-Nov-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efmartinez> OK sir.  Clear

[30-Nov-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
