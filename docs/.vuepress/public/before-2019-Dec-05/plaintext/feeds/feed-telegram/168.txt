[08-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> sorry if it's been answered before, just trying to wrap my head around the creation of Arr

[08-Nov-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> ARR

[08-Nov-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Say for example you send 212.34 KMD from transparent address to shielded address, then send that to another transparent address. Someone could write a script to check recent blocks/Transparent transactions to look for 212.34 KMD (minus some for fees), or a script that will look for N number of inputs to transparent addresses that equal 212.34 kmd. And if it finds them at around the same time, can determine where that original 212.34 kmd went. If you use Jumblr, itll batch these in common sizes 1000, 100, 10 kmd and make randomly timed transactions that will blend with other peoples randomly timed transactions of same amounts, and make this analysis difficult, and if more use it makes it borderline impossible (re @encrypted: i dont see the point of a mixer for  kmd  because you can send all  your coins to a  shielded address)

[08-Nov-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So Jumblr automates the process, check out the white paper, page 79. It performs actions randomly to optimize anonymity, and will cluster all jumblr users transactions of same amounts (standard size transactions) around the same blocks as well (multiples of 10) this protects against timing attacks (analysis of transaction outputs and input times to follow transactions) because user blend the timing of their transactions together with jumblr. Also because they are equal sized lots (you jumblr 120kmd is lots 100, 10, 10) you prevent analysis by TX size (like I mentioned earlier) 
Jumblr will also use multiple secret addresses to further obfuscate these transactions, and still time the movements randomly but grouped with others.
So this whole process is automatic and is more secure than just moving through a secret address. (re @encrypted: real scenario   you kill a person and steal his/her 100kmd     everybody know his kmd address ... you will instal agama wallet and from there you send those  100kmd to a  shield address ..    from that    addresd you  send  50kmd to another  shield address   and after 2 days you   send  25kmd to a  transparent address  ..and after 3 days  another 20kmd  to a transparent address ... so why to  use a mixer ? pls explain)

[08-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea but even then, knapsack and timing attacks can be used to find those transactions and addresses, just using z transactions isnt enough, it may very well work and make it hard to follow with certainty,  but not impossible. The best way is to group same sized transactions with one another all from z addresses, at the same time. (re @encrypted: that s why i say    today you send kmd   tomorrow another 25 ...and so one)
