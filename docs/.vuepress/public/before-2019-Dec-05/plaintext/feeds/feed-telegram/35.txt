[telegram] <Hermes08> Hi there please send us a support ticket at support@komodoplatform.com and we will review this soon (re @LAP: I have put a 10.1KMD deposit in Barterdex's speedmode.
Its expiration date is June 7th. The expiration date was reached, but the deposit did not automatically return.
How can I return 10.01 KMD?)

[telegram] <icoexplorer> All working on pc now,  just had a look around.
What does it mean by you change your address from one wallet to another on the barter dex?

[25-Jun-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Not sure what is the context?

[25-Jun-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> your address in barterdex and in Agama is the same is you use the same seed

[25-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> So both addresses are accessed from the same key?

[25-Jun-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Hmmm I don't exactly know  which type of service you are using over there. Be careful with using your seed or private key on unknown services or webpages. In regards to your question you can use the same seed of Agama in Barterdex and you will have access to your same funds because your seed in essence contains your private keys.

[telegram] <icoexplorer> I am careful that's why I am asking questions first

[25-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> ok yeah well that's our official site , yeah no problem using it

[25-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> if you want to have Hush on Agama you will need to enable experimental features

[25-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> and you will see the coin added in the drop down menu

[25-Jun-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> Maybe the English wording is confusing (re @icoexplorer: )

[25-Jun-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> I mean you can't actually covert an address to another address right?

[25-Jun-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> Is their a video or article explaining this you can share?

[25-Jun-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> What the app is basically is giving you is the option of getting the private keys for instance of Hush in this case with your KMD private keys ...

[25-Jun-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Lets say you are in Barterdex and you would like to export your hush private keys from the smart address you are using

[25-Jun-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> this app gives you the option of doing this by using your kmd private keys to get the correct private keys for your hush wallet in Barterdex

[25-Jun-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> OK so it is the wording. It should say "to access another wallets private key you can enter your kmd private key and export the other" ?

[25-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> maybe a little need in the wording being more clear is needed but essentially you are not accessing another wallet because you should have access with your seed to the same hush address...

[25-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> so yeah I get your point

[25-Jun-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> OK cheers. 
Are you going to update the barter dex to be accessed using a nano?
I'm sure many people won't be comfortable putting their keys into the dex

dont put your main passphrase into dex, just make a new one for trading

[25-Jun-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryzon> curious myself

[25-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <dmdque> I'm working on Bskt which is a smart contract that allows anyone to tokenize a set of tokens, similar to an index fund. Right now we're limited to ERC20 tokens and can't do other coins that are native to some other blockchain. Being able to include a BTC token that tracks the price of bitcoin would be a big deal.

[25-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <dmdque> I heard about Komodo's "etomic swaps" and am wondering if it would help solve this problem

[25-Jun-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <dmdque> I'm happy to jump on the phone to go more in depth

[25-Jun-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Most likely is something our devs can solve If you send us an email to support@komodoplatform.com and a copy to  developer@komodoplatform.com I will make sure for it to get to the right person so that they can  contact you shortly. Also you can come to our discord https://discord.gg/WgXSm4 and you can ask JL777 the main developer himself and he would be happy to point you into the right direction.

[25-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> no I don't think so. The seed is everything. you said you checked the seed before you sent funds right? (re @rr621801: there is no other way to retrieve it huh?)

[25-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> that the seed you were typing in was giving the same address?

[25-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I hate to keep saying it, but there is probably a single mistake you're making in the seed. so try putting a space at the beginning, if that doesn't work, try a space at the end, etc

[25-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> i only set my wallet 2 days ago

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> yeah if for instance when you created the seed you had 3 spaces between two words or 2 I have seen users resolve this issue by trying different scenarios

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rr621801> like what? (re @Hermes08: What I will do and I have seen cases like this before is trying different scenarios of errors that could have happened...)

[25-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> you have 24 words in your seed...there are 48 scenarios possible of having 2 or 3 spaces between one the words
