[telegram] <CockEyedOptimist> So komodo didn't build tech in the right places? (re @Keytothegate: You are not thinking objectively.
• Once the vulnerability was detected it was race against time
•If simple warning had been sent out there would have been serious losses
•Instead the team used the same vulnerability and rescued about 90% of kmd/btc at risk
•Other approaches would probably have resulted in much more serious losses for the holders
•The problem was in the agama wallet, so if your coins have been moved your address was already compromised!! 
•Kindly try to understand this, they were already open for the attacker to take and your funds have been rescued by using the very same vulnerability
•...and it has nothing to do with blockchain but our wallets that had malware
•Because of the actions taken things are not too bad
•You should try realize this and
•Be thankful.)

[telegram] <sayanseb> i have my kmd in my ledger with an address generate by ledger live. is it safe for me?

[05-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <d33zn4tz> what if you keep your kmd on ledger nano?

[05-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763

if you had used ledger, guarda, magnum, komodo-cli, oceanQT, we had no access to your funds

only agama was impacted

[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> So I guess if your house was on fire and you were stuck inside you wouldn't want the fire fighters to pull you out because it is an intrusion of privacy.

[05-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> They would not have been able to do this unless your address was already compromised. So basically you had already lost them because of the malware in your agama. Now would you actually prefer that your coins had been stolen by the attacker or rescued by the team and refunded back????

[05-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CockEyedOptimist> Hello - sorry to interrupt but just want to know if Coinomi is safe for KMD and if it stakes?

[05-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> I think moving forward KMD will need much improved security measures , a seed for another attack may be laying dormant , and over haul of team meembers is sooo important ,

[05-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> but the developers started responding promptly to my messages - this is a big plus!

[telegram] <xarux> At this rate, you and Bitcoins will soon be recalled back motivating it with anything - from not paying taxes and parking fines - so where is the crypto-anarchy without a report to centralized bodies?

[05-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> I would prefer that, according to the loud and pathetic statement about the unbreakable security of their network, my funds were inaccessible neither to a hacker outside the team nor to hackers inside the commanders - today they do it to save and you can understand what may happen - at the peak of cost - once the precedent was !

[05-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> It’s like saying Bitcoin isn’t secure because one of the wallets had a vulnerability

[05-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> It has nothing to do with network or blockchain. It has everything to do with you, me and a lot of guys losing the keys.

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Pablo_cbs> Something I don't understand.  Agama by kmd is vulnerable but agama by Verus is not. How this can be?

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> So which wallet is safe moving forward, the webwallet is down so some coins are stuck

[05-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Verus forked agama and made changes, some of those changes were to apparently where the exploit came from upstream (re @Pablo_cbs: Something I don't understand.  Agama by kmd is vulnerable but agama by Verus is not. How this can be?)

[05-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you used your seed in agama, move your funds. If you used agama at all and have coins in any address that is in agama, native, lite, or mobile, move your funds. All coins (re @Russell: Seeds created from the ICO process will be fine?.... I use Agama but I didn't create the seed there I think.)

[telegram] <Russell> Is Bitrex accepting incoming KMD?

[05-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Seifert> I think ledger is safest since it ask for confirmation while transactions. The other wallets we never know upon new version if it has bugs or not until it happens. But most of us use other wallets for rewards. (re @Ra: So which wallet is safe moving forward, the webwallet is down so some coins are stuck)

[05-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> I did not lose my keys! they are hidden more reliably than anything! Here was the place to be a write-off of funds by THE DEVELOPERS! YES - today in the name of salvation - as we were told! But the tools that allow a couple of anonymous developers to move your tools should not be! So before you start the wallet, you need to debug security and not make a release race! (re @Keytothegate: It has nothing to do with network or blockchain.

Yes - the first thief "after some time will return to you perhaps" - but even if it is for good, it is still theft, even for good! Ethereum in its time hardfok grasped on such incidents! and what will we get now? Is the network infrastructure safe? Ok, the blockchain itself is good - but its infrastructure is well-known! It means that agama was badly tested - competing in the speed of releases instead of focusing on the security of the wallet! You have a dissonance that such a cool project happened? Me too! This is my favorite project - but now the big questions! (re @torsten1: It is, and we will take responsibility. The hack was not in Agama itself, but in an upstream npm module.
