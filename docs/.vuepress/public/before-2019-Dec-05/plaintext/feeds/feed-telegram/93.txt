[telegram] <Cabey> GAS is passive I guess, easier to claim

[08-Aug-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Not saying they shouldn't.

[08-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Its interesting but definitely a cool idea. Though Binance would have to make transactions from its wallet to itself each month to claim it. Which could be a pain with thousands of wallets, but it might be worth their effort. (re @ostalakar: Binance is giving rewards for NEO (GAS))

[08-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ostalakar> I think it will create some volume on the Komodo pair too

[08-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ostalakar> Do you know who I can contact for this?

[08-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Also I always thought it's funny that Neo got pairings on exchanges considering its non divisible

[08-Aug-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jasper> cool

[08-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Hmm I think it might be Ben Fairbank (re @ostalakar: Do you know who I can contact for this?)

[telegram] <tobiasnunes> Some people here said, that for the participation of the Chainzilla Airdrop it is needed to do something on discord. But what?

[08-Aug-18 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cees> It was me asking if it would be necessary to sign up at discord, although I haven't done it yet either (re @tobiasnunes: Some people here said, that for the participation of the Chainzilla Airdrop it is needed to do something on discord. But what?)

[08-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> I asked in the chainzilla channel yesterday .. they told me its not even necessary to join their discord. 500kmd in agama is all you need for the snapshot

[08-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cees> Thanks for asking and sharingüëäüèª (re @R.: I asked in the chainzilla channel yesterday .. they told me its not even necessary to join their discord. 500kmd in agama is all you need for the snapshot)

[08-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> and make sure your 500 KMD is NOT in an exchange wallet! Exchanges may not allow you to access a ZILLA wallet, so make sure you have it in Agama to be safe! (re @Cees: Thanks for asking and sharingüëäüèª)

[08-Aug-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Michael> When does that airdrop occur?

[08-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> What if it's in another wallet? (re @R.: I asked in the chainzilla channel yesterday .. they told me its not even necessary to join their discord. 500kmd in agama is all you need for the snapshot)

[08-Aug-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> 30th August (re @Michael: When does that airdrop occur?)

[08-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <tutupa> Or 15th?

[08-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Do you have clicked on the image 3 lines above you ? (re @tutupa: 30th?)

[08-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tutupa> ok

[08-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> It has to be in agama! (re @CryptoBlockchain38: What if it's in another wallet?)

[08-Aug-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> 4.7 ZILLA airdrop for 500 kmd? Not worth sending to Agama web wallet (re @whiteco: For every 500KMD you get 4.7)

[08-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> Agama is a must .. already you're missing the rewards (re @CryptoBlockchain38: 4.7 ZILLA airdrop for 500 kmd? Not worth sending to Agama web wallet)

[08-Aug-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> Agama isn t a web wallet

[08-Aug-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> Yes for android

[08-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763

Decentralized exchanges are about to become a reality. I believe the first truly functional decentralized exchange will come from Luxcore.

[08-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Its a skill realy.
Been trading since 2007.
Just did 1 year of mining .. was fun.

[08-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Well.. stockmarket is much more higher in volume and not so volatile in price.

[08-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Im trading indexes to be precise.. 
When i started in 2007 there was this thing that there is no entree level into this.. you play right away against professionals.

[08-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> But Crypto markets are even more brutal. As trading is realy 80% psychological..

[08-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> I advise to start trading with stable non volatile major stocks.

[08-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> Then move on to more risky assets.

[08-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mlr94> I can agree on that. Funny how the etf is impacting, yet bitcoin's vision was looking to be away from that kind of decision centralization (re @Matt: But Crypto markets are even more brutal. As trading is realy 80% psychological..)

[08-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mlr94> Oh I see. Thanks Matt (re @Matt: Then move on to more risky assets.)

[08-Aug-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bdouble> It's crazy.  It's all panic selling at this point.  No doubt a correction was going to happen but btc is down what, 70%?  And most alts 80 to 90%.  That's a big over correction to me. (re @Matt: But Crypto markets are even more brutal. As trading is realy 80% psychological..)

[08-Aug-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
