[telegram] <Wil> He wrote this in Bitcoin Benny Signals 30 minutes ago;
It was supposed to be an equity only company but a few things have happened for the good, which was a pleasant shock and as a result they will soon be announcing an  IEO. This is massive for Komodo too as we will build out large businesses on Komodo tech. Very thrilled to announce this to you. It will all happen very fast so hold on tight, with this all coming together I think it is going to be something very special

[13-Mar-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> how do IEOs work

[telegram] <borntobe4live> I think yes

[13-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> IEO = Initial Exchange Offering (re @McAttack77: wtf is an IEO?)

[13-Mar-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> From coincentrals website they have described it as - “The initial exchange offering is a fundraising event that is administered by a cryptocurrency exchange on behalf of a token issuer. A token issuer is typically a new venture that is creating a cryptocurrency as an asset class to raise much-needed capital. This token issuer usually pays the cryptocurrency exchange a listing fee and percentage of the tokens sold on the exchange through the IEO.”

[13-Mar-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> the rise in huobi was without volume, these techniques have been used by the team itself in different projects... It is a mousetrap in addition to having a difference of $ 3 over other exchanges... once the gazelles are selling and they can leave us waiting for weeks

[14-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <vali777> i still think it will reach the high in the pump in a short period of time

[14-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <vali777> meaning a month

[14-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <vali777> and i mean the binance high, not huobi

[14-Mar-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> its pretty insidious

[14-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> I knew what was coming, i just couldnt get my coins off my wallet into an exchange fast enough before the pump was over

[14-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <vali777> seeing anything in the coming weeks?

[14-Mar-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> especially huobi with the 100 confirms

[14-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> not sure, i dont follow the news

[14-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> coins are just pnd one by one

[14-Mar-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> i just hope to sell one of the coins i am hodling when the pump peaks then buy back at original prepump levels

[14-Mar-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> total marketcap stuck in the 130 b range

[14-Mar-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Mar-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Mar-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> incredible that it wasnt today with futures contracts expiring

[14-Mar-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <David> we need the grandfather btc to push the car so kmd also replies. So the rise of yesterday would be the entry of the ready to end up selling higher
