Just gotta wait for the big early adopters to sell their coins and refresh them to a higher valuation.)

each chain can do about 100 tps

Focus Fire: Komodo (part 2)
Security is, and has to be, the top of the list for any blockchain technology that hopes to last for any amount of time. Without security, no bells and whistles will compensate for rampant double-spending via 51% attacks and compromises in the integrity of data.

[telegram] <Yous> Hi, I'm new and trying to understand more Komodo. If I undestand well komodo is building a network of parallel blockchains so each projects can have its own blockchain and consensus?
