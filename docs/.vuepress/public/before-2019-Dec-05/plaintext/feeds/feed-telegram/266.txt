[telegram] <Regnar> There are plenty of private tools. However going from fiat to crypto is likely always going to be restricted by govs, even if the provider is in a friendly country that doesn't care, they can be embargoed, or frozen out of international banking markets. 
Fiat money isn't permission-less, the receivers have to trust the senders and vice versa. Very easy for a US bank to refuse transfers to/from Bank A of another country.
Private entry into crypto from fiat is basically 1. Use cash P2P like local bitcoins. 2. Use privacy focused companies in other countries and hope they don't get frozen out of the banking system for being private. 3. Use a method that doesn't LOOK like you're buying crypto so you don't get caught in a bank's crypto filter. Ie. Buy gift cards, purchase through companies that don't only do crypto etc. (re @TonyStarkBR: We need something more private in the provider side! 
It doesn't matter if the user can hide if Big Gov can still use the stick on the providers...)

[27-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Probably best bet is to find a bigger bank that is pro crypto and big enough that it wont get iced out of markets. Credit unions can get iced fairly easily though have the benefit of being small enough that it's hard to track all of the one's that are crypto friendly in order to ice them out.
