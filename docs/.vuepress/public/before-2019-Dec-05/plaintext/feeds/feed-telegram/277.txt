[17-Apr-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
can you believe that the larger the komodo ecosystem, the better for KMD?

[17-Apr-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if so, then each new coin in the komodo ecosystem, helps KMD, without paying any "KMD tax"

[17-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
this idea that a coin only has value if it is taxing all the projects that use it, it seems to ignore the elasticity of demand based on price

[17-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if something is more expensive, less people will use it

[17-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is free, then the most people will use it

[17-Apr-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo is a tax free zone

[17-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it will become one of the largest ecosystems in crypto

[17-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be at the center of this

[17-Apr-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it is a long term thing and wont be apparent in a day, week, month or even year. but as the ecosystem gets to 1000+ projects, then the effect will indeed become a powerful one

[telegram] <Dwydco> @Thomas : not in first version, the goal was back then to have a secure solution for pirates. The app was released on beta in december and already worked well. I was sidetracked by investors research and financial issues, and wanted to have a solid company secured by lawyers to begin operate.
Back then MMv2 was still not finished, but it always has been my goal, I just prefered the layered approach building a system on a centralisef infra to get the logic and core going, to progressively migrate to other tech like MMv2. 
The devtime estimated between the 2 being so different, I prefered the choice of a slow start with something reliable, and tend to go to DEX tech on next iterations.

[18-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> the goal is double : migrate to decentralized solution while maintaining a good service, and switch progressively. But to be efficient I can t stay alone, and have to find people to make this happen faster, this needs funding so I have to start somewhere :)

[18-Apr-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Dwydco> I assume that building and refining will bring more knowledge and understanding to shape better ideas using the tech as it has to be used than forcing the use directly.
The problem with current dexes is GUI, so refining a good one and just replacing the backend with dex tech makes it possible to obtain experience in both UI and core and develop ton of featured instead of being blocked on technical subjects
