here sorry for the long silence people. The last few weeks have been crazy. Really crazy. A lot of secrecy and a lot of work. Some things got behind but great things are coming. Why, what, how, where, who - well, I can't really tell a lot yet. Official press releases and so on. But Komodore64 just entered the rocket to the moon. We were doing already great, but we are going beyond the madness. So since a week we have been in deep negotiations, filed some crazy paperwork. The result is that we got some serious backing. And we are talking about 78M funding for this year. So if you got KMD, RFOX or K64, hodl hodl, because great things are coming. If you have followed our Twitter, you'd know that we had Ben Fairbank as our guest to discuss the future; and the future is here. Blockchain games will go beyond anything you'd ever imagined.

[telegram] <Sam> Just so you guys know, that this was possible thanks to Ben Fairbank and RedFOX Labs who helped to seal this deal. Of course we had a lot of support from a lot of people from inside and outside the Komodo community. I am very happy when I think about the future. The future of Komodo, but also in blockchain gaming. Even though it has been crazy how fast we were able to this, and it might have been the Universe being moving in our favor. If you have been reading JL's blog, Mr.KomodoWorlds articles and following the DailyChain, KomodoPioneers, it should empower you, invigorate you, energize you to develop, invest and trade in Komodo. Soon we will release proper information through press releases, interviews and articles. We are still a small team working our butts off. But we are making some crazy moves. If you not have started working in Komodo, with Komodo or considered Komodo... the time is now. (re @yorklab: TwilightPunksterToday at 3:46 PM

[telegram] <Regnar> Make sure you don't have any Z funds like Pirate

[20-May-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's a bit more involved than a simple password to unlock the wallet "Once encrypted, a¬†password and timeoutvalue is required to perform certain actions, such as sending funds or exporting the private keys,¬†preventing unauthorized access¬†to your Komodo (and Komodo asset chain) funds."

[20-May-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So this encryption is definitely useful for if your laptop is stolen, or if someone uses it while you're away. They will be able to open the native wallet but any meaningful actions like sending a transaction or exporting the private keys won't work without the password

[telegram] <TheoHx> Hello,
Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time. 
There are three main conditions that the token has to meet, for us to integrate it:
It should be listed on at least one of the largest exchanges;
Market cap has to be over 5 million USD;
The daily trading volume has to be over 100 000 USD.
Since KMD coin has its own blockchain, the integration would be far more complicated than a standard ERC20 integration to implement and maintain. Therefore, it would carry an integration fee in the range of ‚Ç¨50-100k. If you are open to discussing this, please let me know.

for mm2, integrating a coin costs a bit less than $50k. just add a single JSON object:
  {
    "coin": "KMD",
    "name": "komodo",
    "fname": "Komodo",
    "rpcport": 7771,
    "pubtype": 60,
    "p2shtype": 85,
    "wiftype": 188,
    "txfee": 1000,
    "mm2": 1

[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> Why Coingate?
It's irrelevant (re @TheoHx: ^that was the response i got from CoinGate)

[20-May-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is indicative of the crypto scene

[20-May-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
obscene prices for trivial amounts of work

[telegram] <Werxadler> Agree, i wouldn't even pay 1 kmd for listing (re @CryptoBlockchain38: Why Coingate?

[telegram] <JSterk> I don't think this would be sufficient to implement a new blockchain to your exchange. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> for mm2, integrating a coin costs a bit less than $50k. just add a single JSON object:

[20-May-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JSterk> I do agree 50-100k might be a bit high

if you code things in a modular way, there is virtually no difference at the rpc level between bitcoin protocol coins. they are forked from bitcoin after all

[20-May-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so the JSON has the required differences to autoconfigure for a new coin

Pretty much crypto today. If you want to charge a high fee, that's perfectly fine and within your right, just don't pretend there's a good reason for it. Support your DEXs.

[telegram] <Regnar> Btw I edited your name from my tweet because the format I grabbed it from on discord made it look like you were saying it, not quoting it. I didn't want people to spam you with hate mail or requests for listings üòÇ (re @TheoHx: Hello,
Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time. 
There are three main conditions that the token has to meet, for us to integrate it:
It should be listed on at least one of the largest exchanges;
Market cap has to be over 5 million USD;
The daily trading volume has to be over 100 000 USD.
Since KMD coin has its own blockchain, the integration would be far more complicated than a standard ERC20 integration to implement and maintain. Therefore, it would carry an integration fee in the range of ‚Ç¨50-100k. If you are open to discussing this, please let me know.
Please note that the integration of the new coin requires a lot of efforts, resources and time, therefore, it would carry an integration fee. Let us know If you are open to discussing this.

[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> I might be the only one, but although coingate is not big or fancy it seems legit and like one of the other fintech companies! I don't see how bashing companies bring kmd to mass market! Little less arrogance might help to bring kmd to upper levels on cmc. Because right now it's stepping down üòã

[telegram] <Werxadler> Komodo is listed on all important exchanges, why pay for a smaller one?

[telegram] <TheoHx> Coingate is a payments gateway and helps the  adoption of eCommerce sites to accept crypto as payment.

[telegram] <rainbowpiez> Is K64 actually noteworthy? How is it possible that they are getting 78 mill in funding and allowed to talk about it... I've been around enough to know you shouldn't talk about funding till it is set in stone.
