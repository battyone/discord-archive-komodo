[07-Mar-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> You have $5,000. You go all in KMD or you split it 50/50 with another crypto?

[07-Mar-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> Tbh just go all in. If crypto strives kmd will too (re @emmettttt: You have $5,000. You go all in KMD or you split it 50/50 with another crypto?)

[07-Mar-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> Very true. I like it. Agama is almost fully downloaded now. Excited to be apart of this 🙏 (re @changemymindk: Tbh just go all in. If crypto strives kmd will too)

[07-Mar-19 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> I’m building my BAG little by little.

[07-Mar-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> I’ll cost average as time goes on. Just this seems like a good time to be entering. Not saying btc might not drop again.. but 5k now gets me a lot farther today than it would have a year ago in crypto. If it drops more, I’ll continue to add to it.

[07-Mar-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You know you can use lite mode and it's instant? (re @emmettttt: Very true. I like it. Agama is almost fully downloaded now. Excited to be apart of this 🙏)

[07-Mar-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RB_Freedom> Or ledger live

[telegram] <RB_Freedom> 😉

[07-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> 😅😅😅 well uh I do now. I’m at 97.8% now.. so I guess I’ll just let it finish 😂 320GB internet usage the last 3 days. With lite mode is there any difference compared to native mode as far as my receive address and such? (re @PTYX11: You know you can use lite mode and it's instant?)

[07-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> SPV or Lite mode does not generate change addresses. So there is no need to store a wallet.dat with multiple privatekeys. With litemode you get a mnemonic seed which allows you to restore your funds in any Komodo compatible wallet (re @emmettttt: 😅😅😅 well uh I do now. I’m at 97.8% now.. so I guess I’ll just let it finish 😂 320GB internet usage the last 3 days. With lite mode is there any difference compared to native mode as far as my receive address and such?)

[07-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I saw your messages about the download but i assumed you knew (re @emmettttt: 😅😅😅 well uh I do now. I’m at 97.8% now.. so I guess I’ll just let it finish 😂 320GB internet usage the last 3 days. With lite mode is there any difference compared to native mode as far as my receive address and such?)

[07-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> I should have read more. That’s on me.

[07-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> appreciate the help. Would you recommend lite mode?

[07-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> in any case, so you understand the difference. You have installed the native version which downloads the full blockchain.

[07-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> it requires you to syncronize everytime you use the wallet and to backup your wallet.dat

[07-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> it's not convenient but that's how full nodes are setup

[07-Mar-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> Thank you for the help. I almost like the sound of the lite mode and the seed more than a wallet.dat

[07-Mar-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Definitely, you can use the seed on the mobile wallets like Chameleon as well so for everyday use it's more convenient (re @emmettttt: Thank you for the help. I almost like the sound of the lite mode and the seed more than a wallet.dat)

[07-Mar-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> Can you claim rewards with lite mode?

[07-Mar-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> yes

[07-Mar-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> It’s Komodo’s open source wallet

[07-Mar-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Ledger?

[07-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You can use the ledger live software for KMD (re @doge721: Ledger?)

[07-Mar-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <DrgnAngel> I still don’t know how to claim interest using the ledger live.

[07-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Help please

[07-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> By the way it takes for ever to send KMD from Binance to Ledger live.

[07-Mar-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I think Binance takes 120 confirmations.

[07-Mar-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> So yes, takes a while.

[07-Mar-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> How about claiming interest with ledger? Is anybody here doing it?

[07-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> PTYX can help when he's around. I don't use ledger.

[07-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> I also updated my ledger to latest firmware and downloaded the latest KMD app from ledger live.

[telegram] <yorklab> https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024442-komodo-5-active-user-reward-on-ledger-hardware-wallets

[07-Mar-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> From what I understand is that ledger made the update and now you can get rewards from transactions using Ledger. You won't lose the reward anymore (re @DrgnAngel: I also updated my ledger to latest firmware and downloaded the latest KMD app from ledger live.)

[07-Mar-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> There are two wallets that have claim buttons. One of them is app.magnumwallet.co and https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

[07-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> You might need to make a transaction to set the nlocktime so your 10 kmd begins getting interest

[07-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> It's possible that your utxo didn't have the nlocktime set and therefore was not gaining rewards

[07-Mar-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> All you need to do is copy your kmd address, send the total balance from your wallet (Magnum or ledger live) to the same address and it should set the nlocktime now

[07-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Binance is still showing the transition as Processing.

[07-Mar-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Also the send total balance from me to me is that a one time thing or I have to do this all the time?

[07-Mar-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> You must do once a month (re @DrgnAngel: Also the send total balance from me to me is that a one time thing or I have to do this all the time?)

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> This is what "claiming" reward means. It is a transaction with the full balance to yourself. It resets the utxo and you begin making rewards again. Before you had to do once a year. Komodo changed it to once a month.

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Oh you can claim reward on ledger now?

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> That is what I read (re @doge721: Oh you can claim reward on ledger now?)

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> Or at least that you will not lose rewards anymore

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> You have to do it every month?

[07-Mar-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> Yes

[07-Mar-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Or you lose? Or it fills?

[07-Mar-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Same with agama?

[07-Mar-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> It stop gaining after one month

[07-Mar-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> If you want 5% year then you need to claim every month

[07-Mar-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> After sending the test 10 KMD frm me to me. Now the lock time is X red

[07-Mar-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Before it had a green check

[07-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> Good then

[07-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> On agama or ledger or both?! (re @zillamonster: If you want 5% year then you need to claim every month)

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> It does not matter which wallet

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Wow didn’t know that

[07-Mar-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> @PTYX11 can you confirm? (re @zillamonster: It does not matter which wallet)

[07-Mar-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <doge721> Or @polycryptoblog (re @zillamonster: If you want 5% year then you need to claim every month)

[07-Mar-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Someone should write a tutorial

[07-Mar-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> Hahahahahah

[07-Mar-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> There is many tutorials

[07-Mar-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <zillamonster> Google claim komodo 5%

[07-Mar-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The KMD rewards are not dependent on the wallet. The wallet facilitates the claiming function but in reality it's just a transaction to yourself with the right data set. (re @doge721: @PTYX11 can you confirm?)

[07-Mar-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DrgnAngel> I don’t understand why my locktime now has a red X

[07-Mar-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> What's the txid?

[07-Mar-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Yes you have to send once a month or it stops accruing (re @doge721: Or @polycryptoblog)

[07-Mar-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
