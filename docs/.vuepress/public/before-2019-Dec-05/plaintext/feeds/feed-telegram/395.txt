I was so scared of losing that huge amount of money. Within short period of 3 trading days, I received an email that my trade has been completed. I was sent the sum of $2130 to my wallet address.

One for mobility and one to put in your safe as a backup besides your handwritten piece of paper with your private key written on it. (re @Ring_of_light: With one the best ? Ledger nano.
