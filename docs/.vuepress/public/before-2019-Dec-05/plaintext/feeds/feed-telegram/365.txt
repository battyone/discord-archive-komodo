It doesn’t look gorgeous but at least it is still in the range that can have bullish character. 
It either lagging behind all the other altcoins or it is having an extra strength that keeps Komodo above the others. 
Let’s see, if we start nearing resistance, we can start looking for potential breakout and entry point. 
Not that bad at all until support holds. If it gets broken, welcome to the club.

[telegram] <OriginalBitcoin> Does anyone know when the kmd team is going to finish crediting wallets that were swept as a result of the potential hack?
 I’ve been a Komodo supporter since the beginning and luckily had moved 95% of my kmd out of Agama before the sweep.  
However, I’m still very disappointed that this happened and it’s made me lose confidence almost entirely in the project.  The fact that their was a vulnerability and kmd team was able to gain access and sweep my kmd even though everything was offline.

[20-Jun-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the hacker stole the passphrases, we took it from him

[20-Jun-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
over 90% of the funds have been returned, alternative was to just let the hacker take it permanently

[20-Jun-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jun-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if it werent for the hacker stealing the passphrases, we wouldnt have any access. unfortunately, hacks happen across this space on a regular basis and we were specifically targeted with a long term attack. At least we will make everyone 100% refunded. how many other projects have done that?

[20-Jun-19 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the blockchain was not hacked. it was an upstream library (npm) for one of the half dozen wallets that was. we are definitely tightening our security review process and this was a big wakeup call. not just for us, but all wallet providers that use node.js

[20-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <OriginalBitcoin> I understand hacks happen a lot in this but kmd had my full confidence then this happened.  Also doesn’t matter that the blockchain wasn’t hacked, when the coins go missing.

[20-Jun-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is frustrating that we work for years and there is an upstream exploit for some GUI feature that ended up being vulnerable

[20-Jun-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810

[telegram] <KHALEW2MOHAMEDZIANI> Tunesien (arabisch تونس, DMG Tūnis; amtlich Tunesische Republik, arabisch الجمهورية التونسية, DMG al-ǧumhūriyya at-tūnisiyya) ist ein Staat in Nordafrika. Er besteht aus 24 Gouvernements. Tunesien hat über 11 Millionen Einwohner und zählt mit 70 Einwohnern pro km² zu den weniger dicht besiedelten Staaten.
Tunesien grenzt im Norden und Osten an das Mittelmeer (1.146 km Küstenlinie), im Westen an Algerien und im Süd-Osten an Libyen. Sein Name ist von dem Namen seiner Hauptstadt Tunis abgeleitet. Tunesien gehört zu den Maghreb-Ländern. Die größte vorgelagerte Insel ist Djerba (514 km²). Das Land ist mit einer Fläche von 163.610 km² ungefähr doppelt so groß wie Österreich.
Das Land unterlag im Laufe seiner Geschichte dem Einfluss mehrerer Völker. Ursprünglich war es von den Berbern besiedelt. Um 800 v. Chr. gründeten die Phönizier erste Niederlassungen im tunesischen Küstenstreifen. Die Römer gliederten es in ihre Provinz Africa ein. Das Christentum herrschte in der Folge bis zur Arabisierung ab dem 7. Jahrhundert vor. Eine kulturelle Blütezeit erlebte die Region im 12. Jahrhundert. Im 16. Jahrhundert begann die Herrschaft des Osmanischen Reiches, die bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts andauerte, als das Land französisches Protektorat wurde. Seine Unabhängigkeit erlangte Tunesien im Jahre 1956. Von 1956 bis 2011 wurde es durchgängig autoritär von der Einheitspartei Neo Destour/RCD regiert. Im Zuge der Revolution wurde eine Verfassunggebende Versammlung gewählt, die 2014 eine neue Verfassung verabschiedet hat.
