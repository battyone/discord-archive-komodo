[telegram] <Digital> That it is great.. awesome community effort üëè‚úä (re @yorklab: From Steve Lee in marketing:
"Due to the positive momentum and participation of our community in the CryptroMurmur vote, they have decided to do a feature on Komodo following DGB. Thanks again for everyone who helped vote and spread the word!")

[06-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> definitely! People completely underestimate community action (re @Digital: That it is great.. awesome community effort üëè‚úä)

[06-Aug-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There's something to say about having hundreds of likes, retweets, or votes that show a true user demand

[06-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Especially when the results were so close, and they have nearly double to Twitter presence as we do, it shows we do have a strong community

[06-Aug-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> also why I post my targeted tweets here. I don't post every tweet I make, but the ones I believe will affect real change, adoption, or awareness, I post here in hopes the community will jump in and like bomb it

[06-Aug-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Which reminds me. GO LIKE AND RETWEET THIS!!!! One of the exchange sites I targeted liked the post and followed me, I'm trying to reach out to them now to get Komodo integrated for easy swaps from other coins.

[telegram] <Cabey> It will vary depending on the number of wallets, but I believe the current estimate is 500 KMD = 4.7 zilla (re @G√∂khan: Whats the airdrop rate for chainzilla)

[06-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Ledger has no plans to support Zilla that I know of, but technically you could probably claim your Zilla by doing the same steps as claiming rewards for KMD. (re @Constantini21: My kmd's are in the nano S, some problem to receive airdrop?)

Past weekend, spent some time digging around the projects that are doing some serious work under the rug, & Komodo ( $KMD) caught my eye. If you're interested in the technical advancements of crypto space, do follow their blog.

@KomodoPlatform would love to do an AMA some...
