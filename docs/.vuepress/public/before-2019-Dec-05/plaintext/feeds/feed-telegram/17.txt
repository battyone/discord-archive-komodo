[telegram] <MeiMeiU> I know I have 427 KMD, but I can't see them in my wallet and can't access to them. Why don't they show up in my wallet? (re @emmanux: You got 427 KMD)

[17-Jun-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> No. In USA. (re @emmanux: Are you in Russia?)

[17-Jun-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Then connectivity shouldn't be an issue.

[17-Jun-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> That address is the same that you see on BarterDEX?

[telegram] <emmanux> Same address on BarterDEX and explorer?

[17-Jun-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MeiMeiU> Yes. Same wallet address. (re @emmanux: Same address on BarterDEX and explorer?)

[telegram] <Hermes08> Yep spv issues I am making a note it‚Äôs very strange I will do a last shot in a VPS or Vm or last try using the web wallet of www.atomicexplorer.com
