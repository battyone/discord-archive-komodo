[08-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Same seed should be same address. Maybe you have a space where there shouldn't be one. (re @J: Does anyone know why when using Verus Agama 0.5.7, I type in old Kmd seed I‚Äôd use with Agama, and it gives me a different account? I‚Äôve tried retyping in multiple times.)

[08-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Maybe. This isn‚Äôt my first time entering the seed.

[08-Jun-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JoeCpt> what`s weird is that my adress shows a much higher amount of KMD sent and received than I ever had on there. do you guys know the reason why?

[08-Jun-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I must be doing something wrong though.

[08-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> @yorklab I see what‚Äôs happening. The Agama 0.5.7 text entry field limits my entry length. It truncates the last character of my entry.

[08-Jun-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Ok, this is weird. It lets me put in any character than the one I need. If I put in another character in its place, the following character can be the one I couldn‚Äôt enter. Definitely seems like a ui issue here

[08-Jun-19 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I can even make the character that it won‚Äôt accept capitalized and it‚Äôll take that, of course then it results in wrong seed.

[08-Jun-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> OK, can you type your seed on notepad, then copy/paste to Agama?

[08-Jun-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Nope, it won‚Äôt accept it. If I change the character befor pasting, it‚Äôll accept

[08-Jun-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Once I get funds transferred out of this account, I‚Äôll send the seed for review by the team. Really weird

[08-Jun-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> OK

[08-Jun-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Actually it truncates even the Agama 0.5.7 seeds

[08-Jun-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
