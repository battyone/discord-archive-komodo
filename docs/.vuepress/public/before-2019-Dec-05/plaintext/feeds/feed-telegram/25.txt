[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> i have no problem, with giving up that "status". it wont change my opinion about "guaranteed money back" being a thing you shouldnt say

[telegram] <PTYTrader> If you are an admin for a project then you represent them even in your off time. If you have an issue with Pearlpay and the wording they are using please direct it to them.

[21-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> its just like "investing" - something you dont say - its contribution or participating. and yes, its playing with words, but thats how laws work

><HMod_STULLE> sure thing, komodo only
There's a difference between "komodo only" and you starting off the conversation with:

[21-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I thought we went over the criteria in the white paper. seems like they can easily do it with the restrictions on the funds they said they have. Whether people invest or not is besides the point. the point is according to those rules and requirements the money back guarantee seems much less unbelievable. (re @HMod_STULLE: i have no problem, with giving up that "status". it wont change my opinion about "guaranteed money back" being a thing you shouldnt say)

[21-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> sorry, that i am not up to date about the projects of komodo. the advertisement from "intelligent crypto investor" - who i had by the way around 6-8 channels in common with and in which he linked stuff that he got atleast restricted for (by me) sounded kind of fishy, given the fact that the moderation in this channel is sometimes a bit delayed. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <ComputerGenie> ><HMod_STULLE> sure thing, komodo only
There's a difference between "komodo only" and you starting off the conversation with:

[21-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> yeah, sure thing that the mechanism works - no doubt about that, never had. its just the wording.

Since your English is better than my German, I'll say that "sounded kind of fishy" and "nice scam" aren't interchangeable phrases, and leave it there

I'll give my unsolicited opinion too. 
Everybody's free to comply or not to regulations. Learn that no government is the owner of human free will. Read the terms of service, and that's it. It's up to you investing or not.

That being said, I understand your concern, it's valid, but maybe it just does not apply to Pearlpay.

[21-Jun-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe a proper response from ComputerGenie would have been "hey, mate, you're wrong, read their whitepaper", and a civilized discussion would have followed.

[telegram] <Regnar> #KMD Komodo is one of the most undervalued coins in all of crypto at the moment. Let us give you an easy-to-understand-analogy:
-Most platform projects offer a box of scrap metal and blueprints for how to build your "car." That's helpful. But...
-KMD gives you the keys to an already built super car that has a lifetime warranty and is insured. 
In our opinion, they've got:
-better dICO platform than ETH
-are far more decentralized than EOS
-have better privacy than XMR
-is faster and more secure than BTC (approaching 1,000,000 tx/sec)
No brainer at these prices. Don't say we didn't tell you so. üöÄüíØ
