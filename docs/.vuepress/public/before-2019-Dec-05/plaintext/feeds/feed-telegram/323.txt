[telegram] <Andy> Some Admins here for a statement ?

[05-Jun-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andy> I use agama v03.6b in lite mode  and had generate a password.

[05-Jun-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andy> This means i can still send coins...but which wallet is safe ?

[05-Jun-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Which wallet? (re @changemymindk: It looks like it‚Äôs going to the new wallet I made. Just wish I could see it üòî)

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> No stop using agama (re @Andy: I use agama v03.6b in lite mode  and had generate a password.)

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> Its not safe even if you make a new wallet

[05-Jun-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> If you have already used Agama in the last 2 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. If you have not used it for more than 4 months then you can leave them just on the seed. We recommend moving all funds (all coins) out
Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  Keed the seed safely backedup (make a note of that address)
2. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

[telegram] <Werxadler> I have no Chance to move funds in the next hours, kmdexplorer shows correct balance at least, any KMDs stolen so far?

[05-Jun-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <changemymindk> so the wallet I moved to is 0.5.6a is that good?

[05-Jun-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <ManuGarc> @PTYX11 is Chamaleon secure?

[05-Jun-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> @ManuGarc there are no signs Chameleon is affected. I will have an update in the morning with more information.

[05-Jun-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It seems there hasn't been any reports of missing kmd funds on any wallet which is good.

[05-Jun-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <PTYX11> Selling or withdrawing/deposit (re @Andy: Bittres also disabled selling kmd)

[05-Jun-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tutupa> why is not Agama safe? are we talking about hacking or what?

[05-Jun-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Andy> Thanks. I cant move my funds right now. But if i move them i should use chameleon wallet ? (re @PTYX11: Selling or withdrawing/deposit)

[05-Jun-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I never recommend keeping more than a few thousand on a mobile wallet. Since it's a hot wallet, by default it's less secure than a Ledger or cold storage key (re @Andy: Thanks. I cant move my funds right now. But if i move them i should use chameleon wallet ?)

[05-Jun-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> If you have a considerable amount of funds I suggest a cold wallet

[05-Jun-19 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <il_pagliaccio> Hi i alway use password, problem?

[05-Jun-19 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if you used agama, be safe, move the funds to a secure address

[05-Jun-19 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You originally used a seed, so you should still move your coins. (re @il_pagliaccio: Hi i alway use password, problem?)

[05-Jun-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jun-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Yes that's correct. I've reached out to rfox to list so maybe it will become available in the near future. (re @FtrSaroth: Hi @PTYX11 ! A question if i send another coin not supported by cham pay, for example rfox, they are gonna stored and safe on that cham pay address even if not supported yet?)

[05-Jun-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You can use your privatekeys in multiple wallets.

[05-Jun-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Rfox and kmd use the same address scheme

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> Chainzilla on mobile is ok? (re @Regnar: Verus mobile is good too. Don't import your seed into Verus Mobile or Verus Agama. You should generate a new seed with those wallets and send funds to them. Remember to backup your new seed as well)

[05-Jun-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <R.> that would be a nightmare for me üòû

[05-Jun-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
