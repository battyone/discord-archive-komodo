[telegram] <Sam> Its a retro effect. Old DOS games like Indiana Jones and The Crusaders of the lost Ark used "sweater bitmaps" to fake lighting and shadows. (re @CaptainButters: Guess I’m a little naive to this but not trolling at all. What’s up with the resolution? Or is this a MVP concept? Minimal Viable Product?)

[10-Apr-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sam> Three reasons. Komodore64 is creating game concepts that work with Komodo's CC. Retro games are easy to make and these are single level games to find audience and seek out which games should be prioritized upcoming year. (re @Regnar: This is very much the way the game was made. He was intentionally making it like the retro click and move games.)

[telegram] <Regnar> Nope. Also if you have multiple addresses where you are holding KMD I wouldn't consolidate vote tokens before voting (meaning sending vote to a single address to actually vote from). You can consolidate KMD before the airdrop to get all your vote tokens in the same address. 
I dont think vote tokens that have been sent more than once will be counted as a vote. I'm not 100% on that, but it would make sense if they don't want people selling vote tokens. (re @Debodebeli: Can i sell my voting tokens?)

[13-Apr-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So wherever you get your vote tokens dropped to, you should cast your votes from that address

[13-Apr-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
