[telegram] <PTYX11> they had access to the seed, which means they can generate the privatekey for any coin they want (re @AireeZahari: Did the hacker just target or had access to kmd and btc?i wonder coz they did took my kmd but not dgb or any other coins)

[06-Jun-19 05:09 PM] gcharang#6833
AireeZahari
that means you have to definitely move the remaining different coins
if it was the team that swept your address, we left other types of coins because of our limited resources
but if they have been moved with out your control, you r other funds are at risk right now
please move themASAP

[06-Jun-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <AireeZahari> Yes i already moved my other coins to another wallet but my kmd have already been transferred to 2 unknown addresses.

[06-Jun-19 05:15 PM] gcharang#6833
thats great
check the explorer to see if your KMD reached the safe address then fill the form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBsNQJ8P-9O-dXPw_sU1Nhia0J9eJhyvW3CROq87H_Olpflg/viewform

Plot to steal cryptocurrency foiled by the npm security team
Yesterday, the npm, Inc. security team, in collaboration with Komodo, helped protect over $13 million USD in cryptocurrency assets as we found and responded to a malware threat targeting the users of...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6Guadww8CnU/hqdefault.jpg

[06-Jun-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
The attack was carried out by using a pattern that is becoming more and more popular; publishing a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù package (electron-native-notify) to npm, waiting until it was in use by the target, and then updating it to include a malicious payload.

The GitHub user sawlysawly published this commit on Mar 8th which added electron-native-notify ^1.1.5 as a dependency to the EasyDEX-GUI application (which is used as part of the Agama wallet).

The next version of electron-native-notify was published 15 days later and was the first version to include a malicious payload. Following that Agama version v0.3.5 was released on Apr 13.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Not yet , as soon as our security team has concluded investigations we will announce more information on the claim process.  In the mean time if you have been affected by the recent breach fill out a claim form with all the required information ASAP,  also we recommend all users rotate their seeds regardless if affected by the breach as the address may be compromised.  Make sure to generate your new keys securely.

If you had a few wallets swept to the safe address, and will get one transaction with total number of kmd back, it is essentially same as a coin mixer? Right? More anonymity for everyone ;)
