[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Not to say both can‚Äôt succeed but KMD is far much better. EOS is the girl you marry who bugs you all the time, doesn‚Äôt know how to cook, and always nagging you while suspecting you of cheating.  KMD will cook, clean, let yo hang out with the boys, & doesn‚Äôt expect you to spend all your money on Valentine‚Äôs Day when everything is going to be on sale the next day. (re @IlyaPlug: Lol, you think KMD is better?)

[telegram] <N21_0> Do you think that JL777 can't pay Kucoin fee and get listed without any help from anyone ?
the answer is yes he can do that and more
But Komodo need a strong community, JL777 vision it's crystal clear for US, we need build stong community after i will pump your kmd to 30$ if you want this is a simple game bro (re @jwiz168: How about at kucoin voting ... I was so surprise about that.)

[22-Jul-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Kucoin was flooded with bots,  unfortunately I do not know how to make telegram bots.   Future of Komodo will be based on usage.  For the next two years it's time to build the base,  after the next btc halving the real game begins.

[23-Jul-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <njappboy> But it will probably will with block producers running side chains.
Block.one is doing a great marketing job. If BarterDEX had some PR and more liquidity KMD could really rise. The community is really ready to leave the centralized exchanges.. I am huobi for example has a 100 EOS min withdrawal. They are trying to hold user tokens hostage (re @Sasha: EOS isnt doing 50k lol)

[23-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ruediger_von_der_Hohenlohe> As I mentioned earlier... Think about a non programming IT Consultant. The EOS Website has fine grained and good documentation, getting started guides etc. It doesn't matter to a semi good programmer wether the tech behind it scales, or is superior in some ways if it's simpler to use or to reason about than he will choose that project. Even if kmd is better. ü§î I think a reference implementation of a very simple dApp and a documentation which is as good as EOS would get us to the moon.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> The stuff that's being built is mind blowing.  To break it down for people:   What's being built is a way that anyone can build their own blockchain with an asset exchange and single chain smart contracts. ( which are required to get cross chain smart contracts going. ). Additionally other people are working on features ,  I even heard about the possibility of assetchains with masternodes.  It is my personal belief that the Expansion of assetchain customizability and utility will be a game changer.  Why?  Because pretty much every chain/project/platform can now be recreated in the Komodo ecosystem at a lot lower barrier to entry than these billion dollar fundraisers would like you to believe.   Within the next several years we will see the capability of hundreds of actionable contracts.  Loans,savings, a near endless variety of financial instruments.  Betting / Games.  Service contracts.
