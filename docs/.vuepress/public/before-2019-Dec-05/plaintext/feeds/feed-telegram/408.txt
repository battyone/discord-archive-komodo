[telegram] <deepblock> You and Regnar - it seems you guys are fans of atomic swap just like meüòÅ

[07-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Today I'm planning to test as many Atomic Swap providers as I could

[07-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Atomic Wallet, altcoin io, Swap Online, Liquality and of course Atomic DEX

[07-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Are you with me?

[07-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> On which wallet? (re @Cabey: Can anyone point me in the direction of how to move wallet.dat between computers?)

[07-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> @deepblock AtomicDEX is is beta therefore you won't find much liquidity. We plan to do a scaling test in the upcoming weeks where we will provide liquidity for testing

[07-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> You can still test it with our test coins RICK and MORTY or just create orders and take your own orders :)

[07-Oct-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Maybe you can swap with me? üòâ Let's set up a small deal? I will create an order and you will execute it or vice-versa (re @torsten1: @deepblock AtomicDEX is is beta therefore you won't find much liquidity. We plan to do a scaling test in the upcoming weeks where we will provide liquidity for testing)

[07-Oct-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> my day is quite packed but if you go to the Komodo Discord the QA team itself will be very happy to help you out and help in testing

[07-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Well in any case I need some time for that (re @torsten1: my day is quite packed but if you go to the Komodo Discord the QA team itself will be very happy to help you out and help in testing)

[07-Oct-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> I will get back with results in an hour or two

[07-Oct-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Well, I don't use discord cause I'm aware about my anonymity

[07-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> And by the way, I have managed to do Atomic Swap BTC-ETH in Swap Online today. You have told me on Friday that it requires KYC - but I have managed to do it, no KYC. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> @deepblock
backup your seed words and reinstall)

[07-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> That is what admin from their chat told me

[07-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Oh, I see. It is an info from privacy policy and it has no connection with our Atomic Swap exchange. We post it a year ago - cause we had plans to run an token sale in 2018, but we have manged to launch exchange in mainnet without token sale. So don't affraid - nobody will force you to pass KYC here üòÅ

[07-Oct-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Any chance Atomic DEX will run without reinstall?

[07-Oct-19 03:40 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, it is good if there is no need for KYC

[07-Oct-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> But also problems with low liquidity (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> ok, it is good if there is no need for KYC)

[07-Oct-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> There will be an WebVersion of AtomicDex (re @deepblock: Any chance Atomic DEX will run without reinstall?)

[07-Oct-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Werxadler> I had the same issue, reinstall works fine, hope you saved your seed (re @deepblock: I cannot launch it at all. Just a black screen. But no worries, I have only deposited 15$ in BTC)

[07-Oct-19 03:41 PM] gcharang#6833
> Any chance Atomic DEX will run without reinstall?

I don't think so, there were some backwards incompatible upgrades in the gui
didn't you write down the seed words when you created the wallet?

[07-Oct-19 03:42 PM] gcharang#6833
> low liquidity

we are creating antara-makerbot <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/antara-makerbot>
which should help in getting liquidity

[07-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> I've managed to swap very small amount of ETH. But it works fine with external wallets - I have used Atomic Wallet for such purpose - it was funny

[07-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Will try the same with Atomic DEX next time

[07-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MattLaurin> Can an Admin pm me please. Let's discuss.

[07-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <MattLaurin> Hi there

[07-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Ask Swap Online team for that, they already have a web version (re @Acura360: There will be an WebVersion of AtomicDex)

[07-Oct-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Also, tried to do that on liquidity, but it was to hard

[07-Oct-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> No chance on altcoin io. And just as somebody told me here, Atomic Wallet do not use Atomic swaps anymore

[07-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Altcoin*io is no real Dex

[07-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Guess you guys and Swap Online are the only players on Atomic Swap market üòÑ you both have pro and contra

[07-Oct-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Well, because it is impossible to use itüòÇ (re @Acura360: Altcoin*io is no real Dex)

[07-Oct-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> I had already noticed this when I read their Terms & Conditions.

[07-Oct-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Section 1.6 of Swap Online privacy policy is one of several reasons why SwapOnline is not a true DEX

[07-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Forwarded from deepblock: Oh, I see. It is an info from privacy policy and it has no connection with our Atomic Swap exchange.

[07-Oct-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> So there is no KYC so far. At least I have managed to run BTC - ETH Atomic Swap(even with funny amount) without any KYC.

[07-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Maybe he can explain how to trade BTC within 3 minutes by AtomicSwap?

[07-Oct-19 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Oct-19 04:11 PM] phm87#7395
Replace by fee transactions works. If you playing with 0 conf or 1 conf, there is a risk

Ok but there are other knows attack vectors: <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Irreversible_Transactions>
If attacker colludes with a miner (as explained in the example at the end of the link), it can get worst.
About your system, attacker can broadcast the tx to few nodes but not to you

[07-Oct-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> As far as I understand, the procedure of Atomic Swap happens in 3 minutes, but BTC will be received in 10 minutes, am I right?

[07-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> if they are on-chain atomic swaps, that's impossible. 1 confirmation is one full block. (re @deepblock: As far as I understand, the procedure of Atomic Swap happens in 3 minutes, but BTC will be received in 10 minutes, am I right?)

[07-Oct-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <deepblock> That is quite simple also - their is a Swap Online wallet and Swap Online exchange - I have no intension to use Swap Online wallet, I have used my own. I have just sent BTC from my Bitcoin wallet directly on Atomic Swap smart contract, without transfering it to Swap Online wallet (re @Acura360: Next Question will be - Why i have to deposit to an Extra Wallet? Who is holding the priv Key of this Wallet? Swap online ??)

[07-Oct-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
Be careful with 0 conf on bitcoin, it is known to be breakable. Many academic papers exists on it. Each person capable to create a replace by fee tx have the power to attack you

[07-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
