[telegram] <Regnar> For example these are all individual traders placing orders.

[13-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> This also means prices on AtomicDEX may be different than elsewhere, just like prices on Binance can be different than Coinbase. Prices also account for things like non KYC and lower barriers to entry. It's also a good way to arbitrage by siphoning liquidity from centralized exchanges to Atomicdex, which some Komodo Devs are working on building an automated tool to do this

[telegram] <DRGNorDIE> Any plans for atomic to support nano?

[telegram] <Seko1900> There are currently no dates and no roadmap to the coins. Is NANO supported by BarterDEX? Then it won't take long. (re @DRGNorDIE: Any plans for atomic to support nano?)

[telegram] <Seko1900> Nano is not included. Certainly has technical reasons, but Tony and Co. can certainly answer that.

[telegram] <Werxadler> You think all these coins will be integrated in atomicdex? üò≥... Hope for MAN at least, still they don't have a proper wallet after mainnet swap (re @Seko1900: https://dexstats.info/coins.php)

[telegram] <Seko1900> I‚Äòm sure...and many more...but it needs time... (re @Werxadler: You think all these coins will be integrated in atomicdex? üò≥... Hope for MAN at least, still they don't have a proper wallet after mainnet swap)
