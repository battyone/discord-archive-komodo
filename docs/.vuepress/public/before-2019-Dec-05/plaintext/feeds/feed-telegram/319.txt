[telegram] <sayanseb> do you know if its planned to add komodo stacking in ledger live?

[03-Jun-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo stacking? Do you mean Komodo rewards? I don't think that will be available in Ledger Live. You can use one of the 3rd party apps to claim rewards for the KMD on your ledger. Magnum or Atomic Labs made tools to do this (re @sayanseb: do you know if its planned to add komodo stacking in ledger live?)

[03-Jun-19 11:30 PM] SHossain#0007
Komodo already has 5% Active user reward which doesn't require user to keep wallet open with internet connection. If you even keep KMD in a paper wallet, it will accrue reward.

[03-Jun-19 11:48 PM] SHossain#0007
Verus is 50% PoW and 50% PoS. with PoS you still need computer to keep your wallet which consumes electricity. KMD in a paper wallet or stone wallet give you 5% reward without using electricity and without keeping wallet open 24/7.  How KMD is not already more green?
