You can look for transaction id in binance then, then check the explorer
or just search your address in the explorer and look at the last transaction

[telegram] <RealBitcoinBenny> The gaming side of things has been getting quite a bit of traction and with recent talks by myself in Asia and the one last week in Europe, the word is spreading. The developments during the bear market have been significant and the fact the team has continued to work so hard throughout the down market is testimony to how focused we all are on getting to where we need to go. As you would have noticed the media interviews and exposure has increased due to the maketing team working hard on messaging and CA333 and others lending their time to being interviewed. We are spending a lot more time talking to businesses and trying to work out how we can educate people to the full offerings available on the platform. The gaming developments are just the start, and the hard work by the team will soon be on full display.
