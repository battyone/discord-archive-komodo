[telegram] <Sarevok> üëÜüëç (re @Young: Komodo, KMD is one of the most undervalued coins on the market right now. Ultimately KMD's selling point is that it allows people & companies to create and develop their own blockchain solutions to fit their needs. People can create their own blockchains on the Komodo platform easily and with freedom, they are not limited by Komodos parent chain and can customise the features to their needs. KMD's platform also provides a secure and simple platform to develop off. 
I am Bullish on KMD because as blockchain continues to become more well known and more widely accepted, we will no doubt see a correlation with an increase of the price of KMD. Komodo is also continuously expanding its operations to support icos and more.
We can expect a steady increase of price in KMD as time continues.)

[telegram] <Regnar> Its bs that poloniex left BTCD trading that long after the project was permanently migrated, they should have told users to withdraw funds if they wanted to keep btcd (which shouldn't have been anyone) and converted all remaining balances to KMD, idk why they didn't do that. But the BTCD exchange window has been closed since Jan 2018, and was open for over a year before then (2017) so buying in Sept 2018 is far too late, BTCD doesnt even have a progressing blockchain. I'm sorry to say man but Polo let you buy a coin that didn't exist. (re @Muhammad: But i didn't know about this shit i have bought btcd in sep 2018)

If any new coin wants to launch their coin with VerusHash algo, they can. So, launching a coin on Komodo Platform allows the coin team to decide between Equihash and VerusHash. Komodo itself is not changing algo.
