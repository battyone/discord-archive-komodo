the element of trust is about future work, for work already completed, trust is not involved as it is already there

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you understand the concept of open source...

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the source code is all published

[18-Aug-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
public known devs use this source code to make the products

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can continue to try to make fud based on this meaningless issue

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> as long as it is peer reviewed... i agree with you

[18-Aug-18 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Aug-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
well if my code was no good, it would seem komodoplatform wouldnt be using it

[telegram] <Rubinho> even more so when i invest money in things

scaling team is also

[18-Aug-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
GUI people write GUI to the core api

[18-Aug-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
for all things, my code is utlized by some other devs, who in turn are usually publicly known

[18-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> most people are not technical... im no dev, i think i have a good grasp on how this work or suppose to work

[18-Aug-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
demanding to know my identity might feel like it removes some risk factor as an investor, but really my role has become to create the proof of concept and then other devs productize it. which is what is happened with the DEX, smart contracts, notarizations, scaling and I was never doing any GUI. I cant think of any area where I alone have some critical knowledge, other than I can probabably fix bugs faster than others as I was probably the one to write the code with the bugs

[18-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> it is scary in a field riddled with scams

[18-Aug-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are still thinking there is some chance that KMD is a scam, then nothing will convince you otherwise.

[18-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> i hold kmd

[18-Aug-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly the chinese rankings, dopal report, blocktivity, coinfairvalue, etc. have all assessed KMD with more than a casual depth and in all cases we rank much higher than the CMC ranking

[18-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Crypto_mark81> Rubinho, have you heard how linux got started? It is one of most successful open source stories. Those tools that linus and others were building are today in base cores of every linux distro. Nobody viewed their code at start. They founded bugs along the way and fixed them. They builded foundation where everybody came after that and started to build up from their code.

[18-Aug-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
in a bear market, we are not geting new people and existing people are become cheerleaders who push whatever their project does, paid placements dominate the crypto press. it will likely take some years for KMD to be properly understood and valued by the masses at large

[18-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> i think a bear market is a great opportunity for education

[18-Aug-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810

[telegram] <Dmanx> Whole point crypto is that you can be anonymous (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> this whole push to make anon founders dox themselves is a result of some clever propaganda. if you think about the actual effect of it, you will realize there are more negatives than positives, even to investors, for a project that has many public figures who are running the project. which KMD has.)

[18-Aug-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Crypto_mark81> Its so that you cannot be sure. This have showed us all recent reports of facebook and Google cooperating with  us government. Afterwards we know.

just read about people who post that they have X amount of crypto. soon enough, they are likely to have less, maybe a lot less due to being a victim to some crime or official "investigation"

[18-Aug-18 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rubinho> the government probably knows who you are... what if they put some sort of pressure on you?

[telegram] <Rubinho> Norway i think is one..

[18-Aug-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
mostly avoid the very large "advanced" countries, which are pretty much police states nowadays. the smaller ones have no budgets to be tracking everything all the people inside their borders are doing

[telegram] <Seppe> Vitalik received good job offers from major tech companies (google). Nobody he would have offered him a job if he had been anonymous.

[18-Aug-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that's the entire point of police states. yes with cameras everywhere, your every movement can be tracked, with satellites filling in the gaps if they really get interested in you

[18-Aug-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there are many businesses building on KMD already, just look at the ecosystem. many of them are official business, but not all. we dont force people to do things in any specific way

[18-Aug-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
who ends up using the technology, likely will eventually include traditional corporations

[18-Aug-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is hard to predict any specific percentages. if all goes as planned, we will get some nationstates experimenting with scaling solution

[18-Aug-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and once they see the real throughputs that are dwarfing any realistic usage, then they can consider test deployments

[18-Aug-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
of course that is a very slow process

[18-Aug-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Rubinho> that dont serve us now

[18-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why it will be some small country that does it first

[18-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and when they do, their economy will get a giant crypto activity and economic gains

[18-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
which will entice larget countries to follow

[18-Aug-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this is pretty clearly written in the cards

[18-Aug-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810

just imagine if there was just one small country that had a seamless nationstate crypto that atomic swaps with KMD, BTC, etc

[18-Aug-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and this nationstate crypto is equivalent to fiat, which can then be sold via forex

[18-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Aug-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it will create a large demand for that currency, granted in both directions, but not 100% will be immediately converted to other fiat, and if there is a low cost entry into crypto, we could see forex -> small country fiat as a significant cashflow also
