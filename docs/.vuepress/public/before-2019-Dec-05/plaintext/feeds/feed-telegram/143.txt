[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Why would a person prefer to buy pirate over buying more KMD?

[26-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> The 5% is part of the total funds that will ever be created for Komodo. When the maximum cap is reached of 200 million coins there will be no more 5%. (re @Andreeees: No matter how kmd performance is?)

they might well ban it, but whether they can enforce it is a totally different amtter

[26-Sep-18 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
matter

[26-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> This is how native mode works , you need to load the full blockchain in order to be able to manage your funds...next year when Pirate has SPV servers you can use Lite mode (re @pumba2988: Once you close agama wallet after activating pirates coin it disappears and you have to activate it everytime to open it.)

[26-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Ok I definitely see the whole enforcing it part. But just for shits & giggles, say they are able to enforce it. Wouldn‚Äôt that then shut down agama, barterdex, etc. & mess up KMD ecosystem?

KMD and the assetchains use zk-snarks from Zcash

[26-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> ok thanks! and it's an optional feature (to use jumblr) - and one has to download the entire KMD blockchain, and also pay 0.3% to be 100% private

[26-Sep-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hifonz> in the future, will KMD be 100% private by default? or will always have the option for transparent or private
