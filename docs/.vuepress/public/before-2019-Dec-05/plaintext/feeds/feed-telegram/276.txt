even if every usage by everything in the ecosystem isnt having to pay a KMD tax

[telegram] <Boidcom> Hi!

[17-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boidcom> Coming from EOS Space, always thought KMD looks cool though

[17-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boidcom> how would you compare the KMD Dex vs Blocknet or Waves Dex?

[17-Apr-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Currently kmd Dex is being refactored , initial public testing just started.   It is Atomic Swap based like blocknet however order matching is done locally instead of through masternodes .  Also new engine will make it a lot faster . It is mobile ready as well which blocknet isn‚Äôt

[17-Apr-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <JM5667> Done locally does that mean centralized? (re @polycryptoblog: Currently kmd Dex is being refactored , initial public testing just started.

[17-Apr-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> The opposite

[17-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <chmex> Matching on masternodes is centralized to masternodes Bdex does not do that

[17-Apr-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Every person who uses the protocol generates their own orderbook,  can‚Äôt get any more decentralized than that

[17-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boidcom> Usability is more important than decentralization. Right now I can't use KomodoDex

[17-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boidcom> huge problem if the Dex is the primary selling point of the tech

[17-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Boidcom> on EOS we have dozens of Dexes running for nearly a year

[17-Apr-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> Try HyperDEX?

[17-Apr-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cabey> KMD also have mobile based DEX soon, currently in alpha, that's usability

[17-Apr-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
onchain dex is just a GUI on top of single blockchain rpc calls

[17-Apr-19 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
cross chain atomic swap DEX is totally different level of tech, there are no token issuers you need to trust

[telegram] <hotkiss666> The price of TEZOS quickly surpassed KMD, I am very sad, because I gave up TEZOS and chose KOMODO

[17-Apr-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Things you cannot control should not control your feelings, well at least if you become "very sad" (happy i get). Depending on what is your planned hodling / trading time i would say you did the right thing in a long run. Took also profits from Tezos too early and happy about it, don't like it much. But KMD is a different beast and for eternal hodling üëç. (re @hotkiss666: The price of TEZOS quickly surpassed KMD, I am very sad, because I gave up TEZOS and chose KOMODO)

[17-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kirikou> Could be an explanation

[17-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
being very sad indicates an emotional state

[17-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
trading on emotions or having trades affect emotions, leads to bad results

[17-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
be logical. set specific entry/exit. stay with it

[17-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
dont get emotional
