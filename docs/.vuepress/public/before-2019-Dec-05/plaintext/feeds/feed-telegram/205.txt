[telegram] <sreinhardt> I know the guy who does Blocktivity and he‚Äôs a good guy. It might be interesting to list KMD but then also have a second listing of KMD with all of its sidechains. That would make it more apples to apples with Ethereum. It would certainly be an interesting metric.

[telegram] <icoexplorer> Can private transaction be made from ledger wallet?

[07-Feb-19 11:04 PM] SHossain#0007
no

[07-Feb-19 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> That sucks. Why not?

[07-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Because Ledger only supports transparent adress / transactions (re @icoexplorer: That sucks. Why not?)

[07-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icoexplorer> So to do a private transaction I would have to send from my wallet on ledger to an address then send again? And again?

[telegram] <icoexplorer> OK so it will come back

[08-Feb-19 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It won't "come back" per se. the zero knowledge transactions will  be bestowed on a 1-1 blockchain that was created with cryptoconditions to assure it's peg. (re @icoexplorer: OK so it will come back)

[08-Feb-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It's a parrallel chain that you can move your transparent KMD to use the zero knowledge proofs. Once you're done, you get back on the Mainchain

[08-Feb-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> It won't be as complicated as it sounds once it's polished though.

[08-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sreinhardt> Hey there Steve, 
Well, this wouldnt really be a new exchange listing, it's a popular blockchain metric site that shows how much use chains really get. It's easy to hype your chain, but if nobody is using it then what's the point? This side shows how much a given chain is actually used. Komodo is doing really well on it but is being hampered because of the parallel design of the Komodo ecosystem. I'm talking about seeing if the metric reporting site would show Komodo in a more accurate light, taking all the sidechains to Komodo into account, which would make us look even more impressive against other chains out there. (re @guildleader: listing would be really cool. New exchange more opportunities.)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> You do realize that coins are stored on the blockchain and not in an individual device or wallet program .  As long as you have a randomly generated private key  for the address that you are storing your coins, that you keep safe .  You will be able to access them.
