[telegram] <Hermes08> The soft logout in Lite mode will let you load the same coins you had in the previous session without having to add them again... And the complete logout will need all the coins that you want to view in Lite to be added (re @Kpprabhu: What is the difference between soft logout and complete logout in agama ?)

[09-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> Thanks. Also I don't find backup wallet option.
If I have the private keys to my address is it enough or should I take backup and have the back file too ? (re @Hermes08: The soft logout in Lite mode will let you load the same coins you had in the previous session without having to add them again... And the complete logout will need all the coins that you want to view in Lite to be added)

[09-Nov-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> If you are using lite mode your seed is your way of accessing your wallet. You should take a copy of the private keys of the addresses that you have.... if you want to have the private key of each one of them individually...that gives you double security.

[09-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> For instance if by any reason you loose your seed you could enter an specific address in a wallet with your private key only

[09-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> But there are different types of addresses in your wallet..your Bitcoin address is not the same as the one for Komodo

[09-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> so if you wish you can backup the keys of each individual public address by writing down  the private key.

[09-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> The Komodo assetchains addresses share the same public address so having the private key for one Assetchain that you possess in lite mode gives you control of all the addresses that are KMD assetchains with that specific seed

As for the Enigma machine, the first rotor machines were created in 1915, and the Enigma was created and then patented from those designs in 1918 by Arthur Scherbius, it went to production throughout the 1920s.

[telegram] <Regnar> That's great to hear! It is certainly a bargain deal ;) currently Komodo is overhauling its brand and message and has brought on Ideas By Nature to facilitate this. You can check out their previous work on projects like Salt, Shapeshift, bitcoin,com, Coindesk, coincap,io and others. So we're very confident the new image will be great. 
Additionally jl777 and other devs have been developing crypto conditions contracts that can work cross chains and are language agnostic. The creation of them is the initial steps to show what can be done, and bring projects on board to build with them. 
Komodo is a decentralized project so most funds for things are crowdsourced or contributed from the lead developers own pockets, and I know there is a partnership announcement coming up, though I dont know how much marketing team is letting on before hand so I wont go beyond saying that (check out the discord channel for more info too).
There is also a lot of resources being built to help developers learn how to build on Komodo, and in various languages. It's pretty split apart right now (as is the nature of decentralized projects) but we are consolidating them for ease of use for developers. 
Here's the discord link, definitely can get lost in all the channels of cool stuff and 3rd party projects building on Komodo. You can also ask to have your project there too if youd like.

[telegram] <shaun98> I've been trying to install the agama wallet but I keep getting a "Not found" notification when I click on the download link

[telegram] <shaun98> Anyone knows why?

[telegram] <Regnar> Hmm seems I'll pass this along thanks. What OS are you using? (re @shaun98: Anyone knows why?)

[telegram] <Regnar> Under assets you'll see the windows installer (re @shaun98: I had it previously but I uninstalled it to download the latest version)

[telegram] <Regnar> Looks like the website download links are pointing at an older build that isnt there anymore. I passed it along so hopefully it's fixed shortly (re @shaun98: Anyone knows why?)

The website download links are already fixed.
