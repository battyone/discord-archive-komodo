[telegram] <Sergio> How can I set a pin or a password into my imported Seed in agama?

[06-Oct-18 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> You should be able to creatwe a wallet using the backup function. When you are asked for the seed it will ask it you want to encrypt it and name it.

[telegram] <Hermes08> Here is a guide to encrypt the seed using the lite version of the wallet https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024492-create-new-wallet-and-encrypt-seed-spv- (re @Sergio: How can I set a pin or a password into my imported Seed in agama?)

[06-Oct-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> T transactions are normal transactions that appear on blockchain. You can see the wallets they were sent from and to, the amount sent etc. They are just like regular KMD or BTC transactions and addresses. Z transactions use zk-SNARKS, a form of zero knowledge proofs, to hide all the information in a transaction and address. No idea who sent what amount to what address, and you cant see the balances of z addresses either (re @Cryptocries: z transaction ?)

[06-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So z are private

[06-Oct-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <njappboy> Can someone from the Agama team give me a hand. When I first used Agama I provided my wallet seed and Agama generate 95 KMD public addresses. How do generate more addresses from the same seed but past the 95 address range? I'm trying to solve an issue where Agama has sent a my UTXO from an interest claim to an address that Agama does not hold the public/private key pair for. I'm not sure how Agama generated the public key or why it used it.

[07-Oct-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <njappboy> but listaddressgroupings address groups shows 3 groups. I only remember having 1 group. It shows that original group twice, in the first and third position and then a recent address in a single group by itself. It would seem this address group with the single address has the interest balance which was sent after installing 0.2.42c a few days ago.

[telegram] <njappboy> Son of a $#$%. I had not tried again since restarting Agama. It had failed to produce the key. This time it produced a private key. Hopefully it is the correct key. Agama not syncing currently. Is there a cli command to test the private key locally to sign a valid message

[07-Oct-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Use validateaddress "your addresshere" it should state true if it's inside your wallet.dat

[07-Oct-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> other way of finding out is to login with that private key into the lite version of the wallet the same way as you do with your seed ..you should be able to enter it
