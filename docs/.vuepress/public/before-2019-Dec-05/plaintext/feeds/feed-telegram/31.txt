more chains, more capacity

[24-Jun-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need double the capacity, double the number of chains

[24-Jun-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
if you need 100x, then 100x the chains

[24-Jun-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is now leading in dPoW security, JUMBLR privacy, scaling and atomic swaps

[24-Jun-18 01:24 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
nice, so this will theoretically tell us the exact number of chains to hit 60K/second

[24-Jun-18 01:26 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
is a chain defined as a full node?

[24-Jun-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
a chain is defined as a blockchain

[24-Jun-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
you know, like bitcoin

[24-Jun-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin seems to work pretty well, so we just replicate chains over and over

[24-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
right, but what do you mean when you say 64...

[24-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
ah gotcha

[24-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
that‚Äôs what I was asking

[24-Jun-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
64 different chains means 64 chains that are all different

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems about 6400 chains will hit 1 mil tx/sec

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
Jeez

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
nobody ever said it was easy to do

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
haha

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
but it can be done by replicating working tech, ie. the basic bitcoin protocol blockchain

[24-Jun-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
no magic needed

[24-Jun-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
and unlike other scaling proposals, we secure each of these chains with dPoW

[24-Jun-18 01:29 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
That would be 64000 instances running, correct? so 64K VMs could handle this?

[24-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
right. so they are bitcoin-level secure out of the box

[24-Jun-18 01:31 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
i want to write an article on this, thus my questions, gotta wrap my little mind around and see how it can easily be communicated to people who glaze over when they hear the word ‚Äúchain‚Äù

[24-Jun-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem with having many chains is that there are many chains, so how does one chain interact with te other, let alone all 6400 of them

[24-Jun-18 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that is where our MoMoM tech comes in

[24-Jun-18 01:32 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
ah right

[24-Jun-18 01:33 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
I was reading up on that yesterday

[24-Jun-18 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
audo has good materials on that, but the essence is that we add to the notarization data, additional levels of merkle data tha tallows any chain to validate any other chain's tx, as long as KMD is around to create the proofs

this ability allows to create a burn protocol, so that coins can be burned on one chain and recreated on another

[24-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
Could mpich be used to run multiple instances of a daemon and essentially individual chains?

[24-Jun-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
what is mpich

[24-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
quick and dirty super computer

[24-Jun-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
no user has to run all the chains, they would just run the ones they care about

[24-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
allows you to tie together cpu threads from many servers on a network to run a process multiple times

[24-Jun-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so however the usage is localized, users would use the few chains they need

[24-Jun-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
we use komodo assetchains, so you launch a new komodod for each chain

[24-Jun-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming a geographic allocation of chains, you would have citywide chains, countywide, statewide, nationwide

[24-Jun-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so most people just have their city's chain locally

[24-Jun-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are travelling to a different city, they convert to the new city's chain

[24-Jun-18 01:37 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
right was just thinking that through, so where is the bottleneck then...

[24-Jun-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
a bit of prep work but at least it is possible and it can all be automated

[24-Jun-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the burn protocol takes 2 to 3 notarizations, which automatically builds in security to the process, but it does take half hour or so

[24-Jun-18 01:39 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
so in a sense the user experience is massive tx capacity and the notarization can continue on without impacting the performance users experience?

[24-Jun-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization only impacts a user when they are transferring coins from one chain to another

[24-Jun-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
then they need to wait 2 or 3 notarizations

[24-Jun-18 01:40 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
okay, i see

[24-Jun-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
all the rest of the time, the notizations just happen, securing the chain

[24-Jun-18 01:41 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
very nice.

[24-Jun-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no need to break things into unsecured shards, when the blockchains are already independent
