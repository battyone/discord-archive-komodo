[19-Feb-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> Are new projects / tokens built on KMD forced to hold a certain amount?

[19-Feb-19 06:39 PM] Regnar#6164
^ no, but it makes economic sense for them to. KMD gains 5.1% rewards per year, so if you were to hold 5,882 KMD, you would earn 300 KMD a year, the amount necessary to pay for dPoW and secure your project with Bitcoin's hashrate

[19-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Regnar#6164
that's just my thoughts on it. To me it makes sense to make the investment early on, and not risk having to buy 300 KMD if the price went up significantly.

We listened and you will be happy to know that buying and selling of some coins directly from Agama desktop (Lite mode) is now possible. Thanks to our talented Agama developer @pbca26 for bringing us this exciting feature.  Please don't get confused with DEX. This is purely CEX (coinswitch.co API) integration into Agama. If you are interested and determined to try it out, please ask in #deleted-channel channel in Komodo Discord.
Currently, these coins are available to trade using coinswitch API
