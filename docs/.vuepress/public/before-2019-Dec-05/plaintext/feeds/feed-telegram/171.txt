Magnum announced support of Komodo
It‚Äôs a light web wallet supporting several currencies, including Komodo now! Magnum got approval of ANON, Aion and Tezos already and is striving to become a part of Komodo community
Most probably, you will ask about its safety. So, let‚Äôs see how it works: every wallet gets generated in your browser while Magnum does not store backup files or passwords thus the holder is the only one controlling access
Try Magnum, it‚Äôs free, safe and easy to use >:3

[telegram] <Regnar> In case someone was looking for a wallet as a browser extension, this link is to Guarda, a 3rd party wallet who has integrated KMD. Their web wallet and desktop also allow KMD rewards to be claimed, I think rewards in the extension are coming later. (re @Acura360: https://twitter.com/Regnar__/status/1061117582613331968?s=20)

Just checked out @GuardaWallet web wallet and noticed they support @KomodoPlatform rewards! They offer web wallets, desktop wallets, mobile, as well as browser extensions. Nice work guys!

Just know that while I am still in the learning stages of all of this that my intentions are to be inclusive of all crypto. I don‚Äôt know if that has come across in all my tweets.  I feel like a dish sponge üßΩ in an ocean at times. üòâüëçüèª
