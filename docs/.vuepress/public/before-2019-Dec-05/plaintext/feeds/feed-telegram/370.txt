[telegram] <Edward_CM> Seeing the convo above. This has been a concern of mine too. Not enough demand for KMD because there aren't enough needs for it like ETH or BNB. JL777 article is great, but in my mind I just don't see 5k KMD or trading pairs on low volume exchanges as creating enough of a network effect. Even the dex won't require KMD for swaps if I recall. I appreciate the philosophy and am still bullish, just not as bullish as I would be with slightly more use of the coin. Doesn't have to be a tax, but maybe creating some more services people can voluntarily utilize if they want and make them use KMD. It's just not right to see so many lesser projects above Komodo on the cmc rankings and it's mainly due to market making and other stuff we could improve on I guess.

[24-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DigitalNinjaa> We have not seen anything like komodo in the market place to date. We do not know what will happen if 1000 projects build on the kmd platform. We do however know what happens with the gas model / tax. The best analogy ive seen was bitcoinbennys and that is kmd is like linux. If you make it restrictive people will look for a less restrictive way to get whats needs to be done done. Every successful project built on kmd promotes kmd. I understand the "theres no buying pressure" argument but i think JL is right when it comes to longterm outlook. When i first used eth i was gobsmacked i needed another coin just to use it. Thats a barrier right there.

[24-Jun-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
an ecosystem needs a currency and we see that within the komodo ecosystem, people from all the various projects use and accept KMD for services, products, etc.

[24-Jun-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
for a revshare token, then of course it needs some source of revenues, but that is not what KMD is. KMD is not a revshare token

maybe dPoW fees are not so big a usage, but being the main trading pair in atomicDEX, that creates a lot of unregulated DEX activity, denominated in KMD
