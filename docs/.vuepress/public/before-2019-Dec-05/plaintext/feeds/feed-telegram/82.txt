[telegram] <Regnar> The friendliest version is definitely HyperDEX. I've used BarterDEX for a while and it gives you more capabilities and features, but simplicity wise, HyperDEX (re @rene27: all im saying is i cannot use this tech man)

[02-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> Well I’m a developer so if I can’t get it working in a bit then something is wrong (re @rene27: maybe im stupid but its dissapointing)

[02-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> I’ll try them both

[02-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> Is there some configuration that needs to be done before launching to get past the starting screen with spinner? (re @Regnar: The friendliest version is definitely HyperDEX.

[02-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> @Acura360 BarterDEX can often be blocked by firewall right?

[02-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It may be getting blocked by your firewall, I tagged an Admin to see what he thinks. (re @jsolman: Is there some configuration that needs to be done before launching to get past the starting screen with spinner?)

[02-Aug-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> @Acura360 does BarterDEX need an incoming port open? I don’t have any outgoing ports blocked

[02-Aug-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> Thanks (re @Regnar: It may be getting blocked by your firewall, I tagged an Admin to see what he thinks.)

[02-Aug-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think I remember someone having a similar problem a while back. but lets see what the admin thinks

[02-Aug-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jsolman> It says hyperdex is alpha, what has been your experience with it? (re @Regnar: It may be getting blocked by your firewall, I tagged an Admin to see what he thinks.)

[02-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I really like it so far. It is in alpha but I've done plenty of trades through it (though being alpha it's recommended you use BEER or PIZZA coins) (re @jsolman: It says hyperdex is alpha, what has been your experience with it?)

[02-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> for BarterDEX though, market maker should ask you for a port I think when you run it. I just tried the new download for barterDEX, pressed allow, and logged right in

.@KomodoPlatform is definitely true king of #crypto. As we smash more tx/s records, perform 100k more atomic swaps than everyone, launch #dICOs, develop crypto conditions, & secure more blockchains w/ #dPoW. The whole world will know the Lizard King!
