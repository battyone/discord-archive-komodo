[telegram] <tese22> Ive invested in kmd bfore the first failed super announcement  and we had a lot of good news since then but I think that is easy for JL777 and many others take profits from us. Yes, theyre hardworkers, but they can have everything while I cant buy a new phone because of my investment (for example). Sorry for my bad grammar

[22-Jun-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Sagarmatha> anyway congratuations n 21. Somebody who invest 100k in experimental tech like cryptos are has to be very rich, at least 50M$

[22-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> i know a lot of people that shorted the top of btc and they still short every bounce, no the whole thing is if you're still in it do not sell because this market has still alot of space to fall. we need to test 4-5k for btc first and only then we will know what the outcome will look like

[22-Jun-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> thank you bro i hope we can all win and reinvest more and more (re @Sagarmatha: anyway congratuations n 21. Somebody who invest 100k in experimental tech like cryptos are has to be very rich, at least 50M$)

[22-Jun-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> been around for a few good years, I've seen the same happening in 2014 and trust me, capitulation and fear is not here yet, only when we hit that level of depression is where the bottom is (re @N21_0: thank you bro i hope we can all win and reinvest more and more)

[22-Jun-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> dunno about that, btc will always be the kind at least for the next 5-10 years to come, you just need to trade alts based on btc charts (re @N21_0: i hope one day Komodo will be not affected with Bitcoin movments)

[22-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> So... we still need to crash to deeper levels and not recovering for many years to get a bottom here?

[22-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> but kmd for me is the only project besides btc that I believe in

[22-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> same for me i meta believe in Komodo (re @NoManSky: but kmd for me is the only project besides btc that I believe in)

[telegram] <N21_0> i hope not üò¢üò¢üòÇüòÇ (re @Matt: So... we still need to crash to deeper levels and not recovering for many years to get a bottom here?)

[22-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> it might be a slow crash or a fast one, i hope it's a fast one since the faster we go down , the faster we get back up. but in my opinion, the next 4-6 months at least wont be beautiful (re @Matt: So... we still need to crash to deeper levels and not recovering for many years to get a bottom here?)

[22-Jun-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> I've been buying since it was Btcd. the equivalent of 2 cents, then all the way to last week. I will buy more when this market finds a bottom

[22-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> I don't think the bear will last 2 years like the previous time, much less

[22-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> thank you so much bro You look very wise (re @NoManSky: it might be a slow crash or a fast one, i hope it's a fast one since the faster we go down , the faster we get back up. but in my opinion, the next 4-6 months at least wont be beautiful)

[22-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> one of the few project I don't worry about, if crypto is not a fad thenKomodo is here to stay and find its place

[22-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Supppppppppp> I feel physically sick looking at my Blockfolio to the point I need to delete it and probably this telegram for awhile

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> I need to sell my mininghardware then... almost breakeven operation to elec costs

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> how about rebranding of komodo  ? (re @barbierir: I don't think the bear will last 2 years like the previous time, much less)

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <NoManSky> crypto right now is f@cked, there is no volume, too many people shilling shitcoins, there is no new money incoming, this is just an opportunity of getting rid of all the bad projects and have a fresh start

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> this is for marketing team, I don't care for the name

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> you want upgrade your mining rigs ? (re @Matt: I need to sell my mininghardware then... almost breakeven operation to elec costs)

[22-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> eality, but the Komodo team is actively building viable actual projects, and the marketing team is in fact ramping up behind the scenes. The community front (i'm not a team member, just active community member) we still need more help in, and would love more members to step up and do things like talk about Komodo on Social media, share and like pro KMD posts. tag their favorite influencers etc. 
Hope this provides some more insight for you. (re @N21_0: yup it's common fact but i still angry from aminsoft that group or i dont know 
they make market run to -53% till now üò¢)

[22-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> You tell the truth and i see you right (re @NoManSky: crypto right now is f@cked, there is no volume, too many people shilling shitcoins, there is no new money incoming, this is just an opportunity of getting rid of all the bad projects and have a fresh start)

Awesome work coming out of the the @KomodoPlatform team. Always look for working tech before hype when investing, base any decision in reality. if a coin says it can do X what have they accomplished to make this claim? or is it all white paper BS. W/ KMD you can verify the...

@Rabatown if you keep coinage on one of those exchanges, then the exchange owns the coinage and you get only whatever they choose to give you

[22-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Rabatown> OK, so it's not like say you keep Neo, you still earn monthly or daily exactly what you could get using an approved wallet (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <ComputerGenie> @Rabatown if you keep coinage on one of those exchanges, then the exchange owns the coinage and you get only whatever they choose to give you)

you never have coinage on a CEX, you give them your coinage in exchange for a promise of a ledger balance; it's then theirs, not yours

Some exchanges give out GAS to NEO holders only because it's in their long-term economic interest to do so (because some already did/do), there's nothing that actually compels them to do so other than competition
