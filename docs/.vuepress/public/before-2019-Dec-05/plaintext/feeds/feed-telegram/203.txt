[telegram] <RiceNPea> I have KMD in paper wallet from a year ago. Should I move to Agama? Is this how I claim interest? (re @sreinhardt: This is hard without a crystal ball. I think this year 51% attacks are going to be big and more and more projects are going to look to KMD for solutions. I think our atomic swap work and DEX work could also bring in good attention (it should, we haven't gotten nearly the credit for it). That being said I think with the way our chart is looking we'll ATH against BTC this year but I have no idea what BTC will do. It should also ATH but these cycles are typically 18 to 24 month cycles and there are so many other variables involved outside of the tech. I have no idea what the USD price will be this year but if BTC does it's thing and we do our thing I see no reason we couldn't hit $25. If BTC bellyflops going into 2020... man... I could still see us hitting ATH in SATs and being at $2. Too many unknowns but guessing is fun. Either way, I'm in... it's all a matter of time. If not 2019 then 2020. No big deal. The tech is real and the world needs it.)

[telegram] <sreinhardt> Hi Dee,
Yes, Agama is a great choice for claiming interest. Download the most recent version. From here on out you will have to claim once a month for interest to continue building. This change just happened very recently so you will not have lost more than a month or so of gains I‚Äôd guess. (re @RiceNPea: I have KMD in paper wallet from a year ago. Should I move to Agama? Is this how I claim interest?)

[telegram] <loremipsumdolors> what crash are you talking about? (re @TheoHx: KMD hacked? is that why its crashing)

[telegram] <sreinhardt> Just looks to me like some person decided to dump when the price hit 19k.... No big deal... no bad news has been posted anywhere I've seen. Actually it's been mostly great news, hence the spike to 19k. At least on Trex it's just one monster red volume spike followed by a bunch of little stuff... It looks like Binance followed the pricing without the volume...

[telegram] <guildleader> Crashing or dumping? Komodo is currently dumping. (re @TheoHx: KMD hacked? is that why its crashing)

[06-Feb-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sreinhardt> Yeah, if you look at the Trex chart, every time we spike high there is probably a single person/group who quickly dumps on it. Four big volume dumps that line up nicely with what would have been nice tall green candles...

[telegram] <Yobhgareb> Probably a silly question, but my kmd has been on my nano ledger s for about 8 months now and ive not moved it. Is it still up to date or have i messed up by missing all the moves?

[telegram] <yorklab> I don't own Ledger but I do believe you have to update the software. (re @Yobhgareb: Probably a silly question, but my kmd has been on my nano ledger s for about 8 months now and ive not moved it. Is it still up to date or have i messed up by missing all the moves?)

[06-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You're likely going to have to update ledger firmware and all that to get ledger itself up to date. If you were accruing rewards it stopped accruing after month one. You'll still have the rewards from the first month, but you need to claim once a month minimum otherwise it stops accruing further.
