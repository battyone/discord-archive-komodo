And in ARRR we only use zaddr. That i know. It is Zorro Anime Ding Dong Roarrrr.

It would be wise for binance to list arrr.

[telegram] <Regnar> Remember everyone, if someone offers you a deal here through escrow, it's a scam. Admin here will NOT escrow trades, so if they say they are getting me, or any other admin here to escrow the trade, it is a lie. They likely made another account and named it and use the same profile icon like one of the admins to trick you.
Do NOT trade with people here. They will say "Crypto is illegal in my country" etc, Do NOT trade with them. They are lying to you to steal your money.

[telegram] <RSR_sfc> guys, could you confirm something? As far as I am aware Agama was discontinued. My questions is: If I want to build a branded wallet with over 200 assets for any OS via Komodo today, can I ? (I know that there is Agama still on github, but I would be looking for a more ready to go solution)

[09-Sep-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Atomicdex will be available for whitelabeling in a few months.  Chainzilla is offering a whitelabel of its Chameleon for a reasonable price .  Verus Agama is available open source if you have the developers available.
