[telegram] <Louisbap> Which rewards? Do I have rewards if I leave in the wallet or binance? (re @Hermes08: For now we stopped giving the tutorial on how to this with Agama because some users complained that they risk of exposing their ledger private keys by doing so...so what we recommend for users for now is wait for ledger to make this update. One of our devs made an announcement previously this month saying that ledger was beginning to work in this matter and the update should come shortly. The other way around is to create a new seed with Agama as showed in the previous guide and send your KMD to this new address and then send it back to your ledger when you finish claiming the reward.)

[30-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mdoubleu> No. He is talking about the return you get for placing your KMD in the Agama wallet (re @Louisbap: Which rewards? Do I have rewards if I leave in the wallet or binance?)
