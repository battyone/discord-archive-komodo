[telegram] <Ra> Now that binanace is closing to US customers that means  (over 10 million )millions of users are up for grabs, Now , Kmd ATOMICdex has the chance to benefit from this, let me elaborate,   It will take around 3 months before the actuall  changes occur, humans in general behave like FROGS in boling water, it not till when the actuall month of eviction takes place that the panic kicks in and alternatives will be searched for, therefore the team has 3 month to build a strong working product with active users that is scalable , this will then allow the Atomicdex/mm2 to capture the evicted users (10 million or so ) who are looking for an alternative, even if you capture 1% that is over 100 000 users , 50 % it actually the most realstic of 5 000 000 users who use DEX and CEX in tandem depending of the occasion, and once they experience freedom no KYC, regulatory exemption so peace of mind, no transactional limit,  at least for now ,they will never go back. it like going back from at working at  GOOGLE to working in a factory in china. , ...  however if binance manage to lanch it Binance.US exchange they may recapture a majority of their users back. this is a ripe oppotunity for DEX in many reasons and marketing to take note and take advantage , launch should also happen earlier for proper user feed back which can force a virtious evolution of UI experience and wide is security issues if any.

[telegram] <Regnar> OTC aren't high frequency or fast trades at market price, there aren't stop orders or market buys. They are individual deals P2P. So a set deal of 100 kmd for 1000 arrr, no partial fills or multiple people fulfilling it. 
It's very specific, but because of this the fee is pretty standard. Think of when you see someone in here offering a trade, they could go to an exchange but it's a pain, especially if the volume doesn't support the trade (youd have to coordinate you and your trading partner putting the orders up at the same time, and even still you may buy at higher or lower than agreed)
So instead they go to Barterlly, make the trade, send a message with the trade link to whomever, or broadcast it. And it just gets done (re @kremer (n k): I've never used an OTC market before, only Central exchanges. Wasn't aware the rates on OTC were such)
