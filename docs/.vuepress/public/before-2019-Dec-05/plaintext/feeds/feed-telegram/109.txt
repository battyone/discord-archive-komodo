[telegram] <Xap99> Not bad. Thx (re @polycryptoblog: Well you could purchase with cash from local bitcoins. You could mine Komodo directly or mine a coin and use BarterDEX to swap into Komodo)

[19-Aug-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> This is exactly WHY you purchase privacy coins though... Because ALL other currencies leave trails. If they didn't leave trails they would be privacy coins ;) (re @Xap99: Why would I purchase a privacy coin, if I couldn't get to the point of purchase, without revealing who I was?)

[19-Aug-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> with a privacy coin you break those trails. If you are trying to go from a visible currency to a privacy currency, it only makes sense that the transactions with the visible currency have trails, up to the point of buying the privacy coin. But from that point on you can hide any transaction.

[19-Aug-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But I think your question is how do you get a privacy coin like KMD WITHOUT the trail?

[19-Aug-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Xap99> Yes (re @Regnar: But I think your question is how do you get a privacy coin like KMD WITHOUT the trail?)

[19-Aug-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I'll bite and give it a shot, one minute.

[19-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Use a new vpn or IP address you've never used before and create a new one time username to put out KMD buy orders on a Tor based forum in a city on the other side of the country. Buy (with cash) or steal a burner smart phone from a store without cameras. pay a homeless man (with alcohol) to preload (with cash) a debit card from a store, again without cameras. Download an app that can spoof your GPS location on your phone, spoof your location to the major city on the other side of the country (at the location of your meetup to buy KMD) Download an app like Favor, or Fivrr, and use the debit card to link to the app. Generate a new Z address wallet from your computer (running a different VPN/IP address). Log into the app (at spoofed location) and request that a runner meets with your contact, gives them X amount in cash if they send KMD to your Z address. The app will charge your anon debit card, give your contact cash, and you will get KMD via Z address.

[19-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That's a really round about way to do it.

[19-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> But I think it proves a point at just how traceable non privacy currency is.

[19-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> My point still stands though, if you can buy KMD with visible currencies, the most anyone will be able to get from that is you bought N amount of KMD. use a z transaction to break the link from that point. and you can trade using the DEX, earn more KMD etc and no one will be able to know you have More KMD that the amount you originally purchased.

[19-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So depending on your accepted tolerance of tracing a transaction, I think a reasonably private use of NON privacy currency to buy privacy currency is to pay cash via something like craigslist after making contact with a burner email.

[19-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> haha yea that's the big problem is moving from a traceable, currency to a privacy coin. It's also difficult because the way digital fiat exists, it exists only if the sender and receiver both agree that it exists... Bank A and Bank B. so if you want to be Bank B, or a party that receives digital fiat, you need Bank A to agree that you can receive it, and then you need any other party you deal with to agree that transactions coming from you came from somewhere else and that you didn't just make it up... there's a lot of "trust" and "control" in that system (re @Kaichichow: I should start a komodo escrow :') prepaid debit cards for kmd üêß)

[19-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Maybe just mine coins. Kinda hard to tell where or who mined to get your reward. (re @Regnar: My point still stands though, if you can buy KMD with visible currencies, the most anyone will be able to get from that is you bought N amount of KMD. use a z transaction to break the link from that point. and you can trade using the DEX, earn more KMD etc and no one will be able to know you have More KMD that the amount you originally purchased.)

[19-Aug-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> I got a question with this now. If they saw you had say 100 KMD that was the tradable that is known, and you are able to acquire 50 more KMD through a DEX, then when you want to cash out can‚Äôt they be like oh we see he has acquired more KMD now add that to his history (re @Regnar: My point still stands though, if you can buy KMD with visible currencies, the most anyone will be able to get from that is you bought N amount of KMD. use a z transaction to break the link from that point. and you can trade using the DEX, earn more KMD etc and no one will be able to know you have More KMD that the amount you originally purchased.)

[19-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Step 1) move 100 kmd to z address and then to trading address step2) do your trading. Step 3) move profits to new address Step 4) move principal to z address ) step 5) move principal from z address back to original

[19-Aug-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Well technically they only know the address that is directly linked to your visible transactions. So make a Z transaction to a Z address. then use that address to trade or do whatever you want, and then just never send back to the original address. So if you started with 100 KMD and now have 1000 KMD, don't send the 1000 KMD back to your original address because then yes, they could see that. just make a new T address and send there to cash out from, or just hodl until you get a KMD debit card and store your funds in a T address to gain rewards, and the ones you want to spend you send to a Z address, then Z to Z, and then to the T address linked to your debit card... (re @DingDongSoLong: I got a question with this now. If they saw you had say 100 KMD that was the tradable that is known, and you are able to acquire 50 more KMD through a DEX, then when you want to cash out can‚Äôt they be like oh we see he has acquired more KMD now add that to his history)

[19-Aug-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I don't know where you're from, but I'm assuming you're from a place without income tax on investments so nbd about being private about the gains you make from investments. If you're in a country that taxes capital gains, legally I think you have to report the gains. I'm not sure though, I'm not familiar with that.

[19-Aug-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> I‚Äôm in the US

[19-Aug-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Then I think you are supposed to pay capital gains tax on income earned from investments. I'll leave reporting it up to you, as I won't tell you to break your laws lol

[19-Aug-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> but technically if you were to do as I said, anyone who were to look at your transaction history couldn't tell how much you've made, which can be useful if you are trying to keep your earnings private from snooping individuals or potential thieves. Reporting gains is up to you...

[19-Aug-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> komodo is cheap now because of the bear period and because there was no push in the marketing IMHO, more on is that komodo does many things ina very good and efficient way, they release and solve so fast that people do not believe it, used to the other projects always promising and almost never delivering komodo delivers too much i know it is funny to read this but i think it i strue, people think komodo is a joke because IT IS TOO GOOD!!!!
