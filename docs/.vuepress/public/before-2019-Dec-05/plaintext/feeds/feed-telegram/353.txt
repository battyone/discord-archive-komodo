[telegram] <Him_Vichiet> Komodo still in my top 3 coins because they show that they take care of their members and their coins .

[telegram] <yorklab> Ironically, the team is in the process of producing/releasing easy to use blockchain/wallets during the second half of this year. That hack was a setback, but it's a temporary one and a lesson learned.  We may look back and see this as a positive event that may have alerted many who previously didn't know about Komodo and their capabilities. I'm looking forward to some exciting times through the rest of the year......and many years thereafter. (re @Tron83: The team spent so much resources money and time on barterdex which is not at all being used. 0 volumes. Wallet is even bigger priority than something like barterdex. I hope you guys understand my point.)

[11-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> BarterDEX has been being reworked for  better part of the past year,  the reason why it has no volumes currently.  It was too difficult for normal users to use, the new version coming out this year is a 100x improvement and mobile ready.

[telegram] <mtv222> The refund Process
We will use a three-step process for processing claim:
1. A special transaction will be sent to your compromised address. It will be for a fraction of a KMD.
2. You need to send all the funds from the compromised address to the destination address you specified in the form.
3. IF and only IF, your address has no disputes, or contradictory claim info, and the proper destination address receives the special payment, a refund tx will be made to the destination address specified in the form. This does not happen automatically (we double-check every claim), so we kindly ask you to be patient. At this point, your claim is already under review and you will be refunded as soon as possible.
