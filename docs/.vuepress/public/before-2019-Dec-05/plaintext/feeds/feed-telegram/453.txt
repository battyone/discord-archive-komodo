[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> Never encountered something like this before.

[30-Nov-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> You know there's other markets to trade KMD. One exchange, a private, centralized company, has wallets disabled, but still allowing trades with the +10 million KMD on their exchange, and you say THAT is disrupting basic crypto functionality?
I forgot about section 13 in Satoshi's white paper: "speculative trading on centralized services as a core functionality of decentralized, trustless, P2P network". (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Some may argue that speculative trading from buying and selling on a free market is a major functionality of crypto. Especially at this present time. You guys are great but I really dont need Komodo to buy a giftcard.)

[telegram] <Acura360> What's your mission here? What do you want to achieve here? with the criticism? (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Thats cool bro. Theres plenty of other cryptos that offer that same option and... are able to freely trade on binance.)

I don‚Äôt think he knows

[30-Nov-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> Yes, this is truly it. There is no arguments left as everyone knows you have a brain damage. That can not be argued out of existence. They have answered your every argument and you should know by now that you had it wrong from the beginning. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: And here come the ad hominems. Always on time when somebody no longer has any more argument points.)

[30-Nov-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo says an update will be released to exchanges by end of Nov. Komodo releases update before end of Nov. Some exchanges update immediately and open wallets, some update immediately and keep wallets disabled for a few days to see if the update has any noticeable bugs.
And yet, somehow it is Acura's fault for telling everyone in a telegram channel that Komodo is releasing an update by end of Nov, which we did. (re @hansiharjunharja: I'm so sorry. üå∑)

[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> Maybe he is very new to crypto but wants people to think otherwise. This looks like arrogance, although it is just lack of knowledge. Would be easier if people just were honest.
I for example dont know any coding languages and it has taken time to understand how btc, dpow and atomic swaps work, and how something creates privacy and decentralization and how something destroys this. Also understanding the monetary system and its problems is a must for understanding why crypto, and why its important to have the kind of tech that komodo is providing.

[30-Nov-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Yup, I just randomly threw a dart and it landed on KMD. Thats how I decided this is the coin I wanted to speculatively trade. You are one smart fanboy.

[30-Nov-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> He said he and his team have done explainer videos for over 7 years. I'm not sure how many of those were in crypto, but there is definitely a disconnect about what exactly Komodo is doing and what Binance is doing. We aren't Binance and don't control Binance wallets. (re @hansiharjunharja: Maybe he is very new to crypto but wants people to think otherwise. This looks like arrogance, although it is just lack of knowledge.

[30-Nov-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you're going to randomly choose a coin for speculative trading, I'd suggest narrowing the pool to coins with a Beta of <0 or >1.

[30-Nov-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Guess the sense of sarcasm was missed. I trade to ultimately end up with more KMD. But you may very well have a point to venture around with current existing blockers in the market.

[30-Nov-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nah I kinda got it, but my point was a legit one. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Guess the sense of sarcasm was missed. I trade to ultimately end up with more KMD. But you may very well have a point to venture around with current existing blockers in the market.)

[telegram] <x22nnaru> you are sure? komod use dPOS... and you can stake your kmd for a 5% annualy... (re @polycryptoblog: Komodo isn‚Äôt a staking coin,  the user rewards are not the same as staking)

[30-Nov-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <erav3n> It's 5% reward, but it's not staking. Internally it used other tech. You even don't need running wallet to acquire rewards. So, it can't be call staking.
