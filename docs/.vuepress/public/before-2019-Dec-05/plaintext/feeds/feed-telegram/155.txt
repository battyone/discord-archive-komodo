[telegram] <PTYX11> The full sync usually takes 7-48 hours days depending on how fast your connection is.

[07-Oct-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> How long have you been syncing?

[telegram] <krisninakos> ok now starts it was stucked

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> question: why don't you use the light wallet if you are having such a hard time with the native mode?

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> because someone from the team yesterday here

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> you dont need to sync anything with the litewallet. create the seed, login, and vioala. you're good to go.

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> told me only the native

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> really

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> what the difference with native

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> if you dont have any funds in the wallet.dat I dont see the  point of using native unless you want to run a full node

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kingsking612> Can Komodo swap names with Pirate?

[07-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> he told me that he will give me his peers

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> full node how many kmd are

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kingsking612> ðŸ˜€

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> ?

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Full node means download the full blockchain

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> there is masternode in komodo?

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> it has nothing to do with masternodes

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> ok

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kingsking612> Komodo is the best name in Blockchain

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> better to download the full blockchain for more protection

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> that is a misconception (re @krisninakos: better to download the full blockchain for more protection)

[07-Oct-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> lokomodo (re @kingsking612: Komodo is the best name in Blockchain)

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> I see you are struggling with native. I suggest you use the light wallet.

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> ok i can also deposit and stake there

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> my komodo

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> ?or not

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kingsking612> Lokomodo better name for pirate (re @krisninakos: lokomodo)

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> yes, you will accrue rewards on light mode

[07-Oct-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kingsking612> The light wallet works like a charm kris (re @PTYX11: I see you are struggling with native. I suggest you use the light wallet.)

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> you have also the light (re @kingsking612: The light wallet works like a charm kris)

[07-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> but what the meaning having native if nobody can download it xoaxoa lol

[07-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> native depends on connections. it also depends on your system settings. you might have an antivirus blocking the daemon. This happens often on Windows (re @krisninakos: but what the meaning having native if nobody can download it xoaxoa lol)

[07-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> i dont use antivirus just the widnws defender nothing block the connection all the other wallets working perfectly

[07-Oct-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Native mode is made for those people who want to download the full bockchain. Some people choose native becuase they think it's more secure than electrumx (light mode) but that is not the case. You would help the network by running native and leaving it online forever. but most users only use the wallet for a few minutes and disconnect. hence, there is no reason for them to run a native wallet.

[07-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> i'll check native mode on windows today and check if i have any isues. i haven't tested the latest wallet on native yet. (re @krisninakos: i dont use antivirus just the widnws defender nothing block the connection all the other wallets working perfectly)

[07-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> ok if someone can give me peers file without hack inside please :P from the team so i can connect

[07-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You only really need native if using Z-Transactions, otherwise lite is the way to go.

[07-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> easier to use with no fuss.

[07-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> its the same amount of % staking native and light?

[07-Oct-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> yes, the same

[07-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> And you don't neet to leave it open.

[07-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> how much every month 0.5%?

[07-Oct-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <PTYX11> what would you prefer? 30% a year? lol (re @krisninakos: lol only?)

[07-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> It adds up. You claim, then accrue on the new amount.

[07-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Oct-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <krisninakos> nope 30 but 10% is enough good for such a coin with power (re @PTYX11: what would you prefer? 30% a year? lol)
