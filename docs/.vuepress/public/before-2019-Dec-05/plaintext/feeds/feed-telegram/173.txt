[telegram] <polycryptoblog> No,  Komodo is just a technology provider.   If you haven't noticed the handful of chains that have spawned recently all had rapid integration into wallets exchanges and other technological integrations,  while retaining full autonomy

[16-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I'm messing around with it right now, idk the team that made it though so definitely do your research on them before depositing funds. I put a few in to see how it works. It so far seems really nice tbh. You go to the site, create a wallet and they download the backup key to your computer (wherever you want, could do USB too) and then when you want to login, it either remembers where you keep it and you use a password, or if you use incognito browsers, you just click import from backup, and browse to the location you stored the backup, then use password. Seems to be working fine right now. (re @Braydean: What is the function of this wallet)

[16-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <avprust> Hey Magnum is web-based light wallet. You can create/restore/backup KMD wallet and claim the rewards there (re @Braydean: How does the magnum wallet works)

[16-Nov-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> you’re absolutely right, we are third party wallet, and doing the universal wallet. Komodo is just one brillialnt in the our portfolio. You have always backup with your keys locally. As far as we are light wallet, we nothing know about customers keys, so it’s very important to keep passhrase from the backup. There is no way to restore it at our side. (re @Regnar: I'm messing around with it right now, idk the team that made it though so definitely do your research on them before depositing funds.

[telegram] <Regnar> Thanks for coming in Andrey! Yea I sent some KMD to the wallet and really like the layout and feel. I was impressed by the knowledge base you incorporated into the claim rewards function and realized Chainzilla had consulted with you about the specifics. It's a great touch to see the rewards requirements, the tips on not claiming small amounts, and the monthly claiming requirement. PLUS I love watching the rewards grow by the second! Haha (re @avprust: We’ll apprecite for any feedback that Komodo community give us. Together we are able to deliver perfect tool for all Komodo lovers.)

[16-Nov-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> well, I'm Andrew and I'm Magnum CPO, past two years I'm doing projects in crypto. The previous one was also web wallet, it won the contest that was organized by ShapeShift and Blockstack (not sure that I can post the link here.. just don't want to be banned automatically)
Now I'm doing Magnum as the universal wallet that will help to get the passive earnings in crypto using airdrops and variations of PoS, PoI. Just because of this you can find in our wallet famous, matured coins and new ones (like Tezos, AION, ANON, BCH SV (sic!))
Magnum team has 7 members, we are experts in IT, fintech, mobile, math, UI, PR and marketing.

[16-Nov-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Nice! Yea I've noticed the theme in the wallet is very helpful in finding airdrops, forks, and such that belong to a user but may not be known, and even saw fork claiming information as far back as ETC. As I understand there's support for delegated proof of stake, tezos Baker fee, kmd rewards, and I assume others, are access to these coin unique features essentially the selling point for Magnum?

[16-Nov-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea ledger integration is a hot topic here in Komodo since we've been integrated since early 2017, but have gotten no support for the KMD rewards system since then.

[16-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So I'm curious as to the revenue strategy for Magnum, are there coin listing costs, or TX fees added? (re @avprust: it’s our initial product features, we’are goiing to add as more coins (matured and latest forks), as new amazing features next month. I hope that everybody will enjoy by integration with ledger e.g.)

[16-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> TX fee is defined by network, Magnum doesn’t change it

[16-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> we’ll add service feature a bit later, like buid-in exchnage and bying/selling crypto. These fetaure assumes that we can have some comission.

[16-Nov-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Right, makes sense. As for other coins that are built using Komodo, what's the process like for integration? (re @avprust: we’ll add service feature a bit later, like buid-in exchnage and bying/selling crypto. These fetaure assumes that we can have some comission.)

[16-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> We need to spent some time fot the research firstly.  Going to support Zilla first.

[16-Nov-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <avprust> Can you estimate amount of networks that based on Komodo?

[16-Nov-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I estimate about 40 live coins right now, and more projects in initial coin offering phase, as well as other projects starting out or performing airdrops to KMD holders. It's a bit different because each coin is it's own independent chain, unlike being a token on ETH chain. So I'd imagine integration would be somewhat selective. I'm more wondering how a KMD project can seek integration with Magnum wallet (re @avprust: Can you estimate amount of networks that based on Komodo?)

[telegram] <avprust> let me some time to go deeper in KMD issues, definetely we’ll try to find transparent and clear process for the integration. It should be clear also for the users. The exapmple of ETH is very representative in that terms. Now we can support ERC tokens as much as we want. I like this approach. But firstly we need to go through the docs, also Zilla integration will help us with this issue.

[telegram] <Braydean> How can i download agama wallet ? (re @Regnar: Agama is Komodo's official desktop wallet)

[17-Nov-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Magnum is a very new wallet and there aren't any guides. It's also web wallet so a bit different than Agama (re @Braydean: How about magnum wallet ?)

[telegram] <PTYX11> Agama is the only wallet officially supported by Komodo

[17-Nov-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> So I would suggest Agama

[17-Nov-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Braydean> Do you have mobile wallet og agama ?

[17-Nov-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Braydean> What is the benefits if i store kmd on agama wallet

[17-Nov-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> You can claim the transaction reward

[17-Nov-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> If Komodo blockchain is as strong as the team claims, why is there no public records of this?

[17-Nov-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cammofunk> Like a stress test like DASH just did

[17-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <alexgrowler> Hey there! I'm from Magnum team. The benefits are pretty clear: Magnum is a universal wallet, it means you can hold not only KMD, but also other coins there (re @Braydean: What is the benefits if i store kmd on agama wallet)

[17-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <alexgrowler> We will publish our guide how to claim KMD pretty soon

[17-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <alexgrowler> But till that time you can try to do it by yourself. It's pretty easy😊
