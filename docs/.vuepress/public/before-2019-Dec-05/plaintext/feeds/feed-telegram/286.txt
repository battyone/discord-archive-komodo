[telegram] <Acura360> There is an OP-ID if you make an withdraw on Pirate/Agama - (re @murphyintl: Ok but why no transaction history in agama after sending.  I can’t find tx id)

[02-May-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Everytime you send funds out, safe this OP-ID

[02-May-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <murphyintl> I cannot find it? (re @Acura360: Everytime you send funds out, safe this OP-ID)

[02-May-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> The OP-ID is cleared after you close Agama (re @murphyintl: I cannot find it?)

[02-May-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you should record the txid in the opid, once restart that is not available. very privacy
