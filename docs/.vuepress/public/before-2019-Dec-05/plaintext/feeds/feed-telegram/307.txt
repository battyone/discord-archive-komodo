[telegram] <Common_Cents_Crypto> I gave up trying... I ended up using Magnum wallet which actually has a pretty nice looking & easy to use interface. 
Kind of made me wonder why I ever started using the atomic labs site in the first place. (re @TensaZangetsu2: I have error too. failed to fetch.)

[telegram] <Acura360> You can also use the Lite Mode on Agama (re @Jesse: i am a first time KMD user, I downloaded Agama wallet, it says activating best chain, it has said this for two days)

[26-May-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
