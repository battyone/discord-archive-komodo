[telegram] <ERGOfanboy> Why has everyone been saying coinbase?

[07-Jul-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Such rumors are very normal during fomo. (re @ERGOfanboy: Why has everyone been saying coinbase?)

[07-Jul-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <omg_gawd> Lol if no coinbase now it gnna damp

[07-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ERGOfanboy> I think with 90% certainty, no coinbase.  Maybe after couple months of rebrand.

[07-Jul-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> but the team never even hinted about anything related to coinbase

[07-Jul-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> it came from literally nowhere lol

[07-Jul-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> We are on the 44th place and going to up. So, you say Coinbase is possible. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> i think coinbase displays all of the top 50 coins)

[07-Jul-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <vogelfreund> Everything is possible

[07-Jul-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
display vs list on the main coinbase are two totally different things

[07-Jul-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Displays, not lists ffs lol

[07-Jul-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <mo7881> Atomicdex could mean Coinbase will not be a fan of KMD. Its going to be huge

[07-Jul-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> Just read about OGO. Seems to be a copy of KMD. But a new project, so the price is up a lot. Just shows how Komodo will be valued even more than it shows today with the rank43 on cmc. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

[telegram] <John> Who will keep the fees from atomicDEX ?

[07-Jul-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> DEX receives 50% of all dex fees on AtomicDEX. The current holdings of all dex fees can be seen by visiting 
This shows all the dex fees collected for every coin. Before payout, these will be traded for KMD and then distributed according to the revenue sharing model. This is the distribution of the dex fees:
50% ‚Äì DEX
15% ‚Äì JUMBLR
15% ‚Äì BOTS
5% ‚Äì REVS
5% ‚Äì MGW
10% ‚Äì Claimed by the GUI developer

[07-Jul-19 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I'm assuming it's still accurate. Also notice that 'Before payout, these will be traded for KMD'

[07-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Fees will be collected in whatever coin you're trading in. Then all those fees will be used to purchase KMD, then distributed.

yes, that is correct

[07-Jul-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
