[29-Jul-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can send in one transaction payments to multiple addresses a script is used for that matter. In that way you save costs. (re @TheInterstellar: How come there are more payments than transactions on any given day?

[29-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> From 5836 transactions you are seeing 42k payments to addresses each transaction contains an amount of those payments if you divide 42k between 5k you get around 8 payments per transaction. You will have to look for the each tx id eo0031638bhgg that looks like this in the explorer to see which payments were made
