[telegram] <yorklab> I believe the wallet has always had that warning.

[04-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes the wallet has always had that warning. It is the stable version but is always being improved. (re @icantgiveyou: What‚Äôs stable version? This one was on komodoplatform website)

[04-Jun-19 04:59 PM] gcharang#6833
@icantgiveyou your seed will always be able to access the funds, the pin and file are tools for convenience
even if you forget pin, you can use the seed to restore the wallet again with a new name

[telegram] <BrokenBank> Great points. Makes a lot of sense. Build the brand and usability.
I guess a similar analogy is buying Apple stocks. You can just buy a phone to use one, but Apple stocks are sought after due to the success of the brand. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> or we could charge a big huge KMD tax and get little to no adoption, but maybe it looks good on paper for those that dont understand the elasticity of demand based on higher prices)
