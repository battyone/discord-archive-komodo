45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.
However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?)

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> people want moon but not to put on the space suit and train for it, nobody will know the good of komodo if we sit our asses waiting, whenever i talk with somebody interested in crypto i put komodo in there with all the great thing it achieved, internet is great but in person it is more powerful than any social, so do not be shy and spread the word about the goodness of komodo platform

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> komodo will be the best coin AND the most complete out there in the moment the smart contracts are ready, we invested in the most incredible project but if we do not believe in it it will be all in vain, people do not buy things that are the best they buy the best marketed in a way or in another so we have help the campaigns, we need to bring more real people and less bots in telegram,
