[telegram] <TheInterstellar> Anyone knows where to view the volume of atomic swaps performed on Komodo?

[14-Dec-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Dec-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> I‚Äôm in there now but I‚Äôm looking for total volume to date of all atomic swaps performed on Komodo, any idea how to look it up? (re @polycryptoblog: dexstats.info)

[14-Dec-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Don't think there is a way,  there is no central repository of trade data,  and what dexstats shows is only what is public on netid1

[14-Dec-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> There are 14000+ netid

[14-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> And one can make private their offers

[14-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Over 115000 Aromic Swaps actually

[14-Dec-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> He is looking for volume of those swaps

[14-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Only way I can think of to get a number for that is to go to all the Dex fee addresses and multiply by 777

[14-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> 14,000 different swaps of 14,000 KMD worth of swaps? (re @polycryptoblog: There are 14000+ netid)

[14-Dec-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> No

[14-Dec-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Think of it like an IRC,  each netid is a different chatroom

[14-Dec-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> So that‚Äôs 14k different atomic swaps, right? (re @polycryptoblog: Think of it like an IRC,  each netid is a different chatroom)

[14-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> How did you get that 115k number? (re @Acura360: Over 115000 Aromic Swaps actually)

[14-Dec-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <mikeg59274> Thank you

[14-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> No.  They are networks to do swaps on. Over 115k atomic swaps have been done (re @TheInterstellar: So that‚Äôs 14k different atomic swaps, right?)

[14-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Never was 10,  5% yearly if you claim every month

[14-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> Ok... so the KMD volume of those 115725 atomic swaps is 7.2m KMD or USD ? (re @polycryptoblog: Just in Komodo there has been 7.2million volume)

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Multiply by 777

[14-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheInterstellar> The fee has always been 777 since 2014 ? (re @polycryptoblog: Multiply by 777)

[14-Dec-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> 1/777 of the trade amount.  And no that's just what is in BarterDEX .  The first swaps  didn't have a fee for spam prevention.

[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <polycryptoblog> BarterDEX didn't come live til 2017

[14-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <ThePsycolive> What is the highline of this new update on Komodo?

[14-Dec-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> What is Sapling?
Sapling is a network upgrade that introduces significant efficiency improvements for shielded transactions that will pave the way for broad mobile, exchange and vendor adoption of Komodo shielded addresses.
Improvements
Performance for shielded addresses
    Payments involving the new Sapling z-addresses can be constructed in as little as a few seconds and with only 40 megabytes of memory.
Decoupled spend authority
    Allows the hardware that constructs the zero-knowledge proof to be independent from the hardware that signs for the transaction.
Improved keys
    Full viewing keys allow owners of shielded addresses the ability to view incoming and outgoing transaction details without exposing their private spending key. (re @ThePsycolive: What is the highline of this new update on Komodo?)
