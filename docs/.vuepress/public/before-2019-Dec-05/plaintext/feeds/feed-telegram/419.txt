[telegram] <Werxadler> Yes, atomicdex is a real dex, so you have to cover tx fees. (re @Stixex_support: so if I want to exchange DAI for BTC in atomicdex, then I also must have some ether in my wallet ? in order to cover gas fees for ERC20 coin ?)

[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> and are the in KMD???

[27-Oct-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> The DEX fees are 1/777, roughly 0.13% of the value of the transaction, and it is paid in the coin being swapped (not KMD). However the fees collected are used to buy KMD on the open market and sent to holders of the DEX coin. (re @Bar_Harbor: so how much are the fees gonna be on AtomicDex)

Frequently Asked Questions | Bittrex Global
The Bittrex Global platform offers a wide variety of token markets.
https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*39NJ_GB8x9P3eaPR3ptdGA.jpeg

[27-Oct-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> The reason for this is that every token listed on Bittrex Global must first obtain a legal opinion from qualified Liechtenstein counsel stating that it is not a financial instrument, e-money, nor deposit under EU and Liechtenstein law. This is important to us as it provides comfort to our users that a qualified attorney has reviewed each token that we offer and is in-line with our obligations under Liechtenstein law.
Until these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline. We are displaying these offline markets because they were previously offered through Bittrex International. If you are a former Bittrex International customer with tokens in these markets, you can keep them in your account or withdraw them. Your funds are safe and in your control.

[27-Oct-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Deadpool1001> Quick question. Why is the minimum limit 0.00777 btc when i try to swap btc to kmd?

[29-Oct-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees. (re @Deadpool1001: Quick question. Why is the minimum limit 0.00777 btc when i try to swap btc to kmd?)

[telegram] <Deadpool1001> Alright. Thanks for info. (re @Acura360: It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees.)

[29-Oct-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
without such a limit, the bug will be "why is the txfee 25% of the transaction"

[29-Oct-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is the better choice to require higher amount than let people be able to trade where the miner fee eats up most of the value. as it is, if BTC fees go crazy, i think it can easily reach 10%, which is on the very high side

[29-Oct-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Deadpool1001> Gotcha.

[29-Oct-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you could ask the legacy devs to increase blocksize so txfees can stay low
