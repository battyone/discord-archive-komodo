orders here: https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/

[27-Sep-19 04:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@Regnar are messages from discord not coming through?

[27-Sep-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Or I have to send BTC to Atomic DEX, swap it to ETH, then withdraw ETH to my WALLET?

[27-Sep-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Thanks, will check it out (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> orders here: https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/)

[27-Sep-19 04:44 PM] gcharang#6833
to trade ETH, you need to already have a little amount of ETH to cover tx fees that start the atomic swap process

[27-Sep-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay so quick explanation. AtomicDEX is a wallet that uses AtomicAPI to access and make trades on MM2. ANY Wallet can do this by using the AtomicAPIs, however being in beta, we aren't directly pushing for this yet. (re @deepblock: And I want to see orders without sending my funds. I'm not quite sure, if there are any orders on your Dex)

[27-Sep-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So people can build a website that calls just the orderbook API to see orderbooks for all coins

[27-Sep-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Or wallets can access the API to trade directly from their own apps, but right now AtomicDEX is the GUI we have for this

[27-Sep-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Well, in this case - what is your killer feature? I mean, there are other atomic swap services - the old ones

[27-Sep-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Okay, I will send some eth and btc for testing and get back to you (re @Regnar: Okay so quick explanation. AtomicDEX is a wallet that uses AtomicAPI to access and make trades on MM2. ANY Wallet can do this by using the AtomicAPIs, however being in beta, we aren't directly pushing for this yet.)

[27-Sep-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There are other ones that are working on it too, ChainSwap, HyperDEX are both using the APIs and therefore sharing liquidity

[27-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There aren't really any atomic swap services. Atomic swaps are trust less, p2p swaps, where you maintain control of your keys the whole time. Most rely on a 3rd party you send funds to and trust they will swap your coins (re @deepblock: Well, in this case - what is your killer feature? I mean, there are other atomic swap services - the old ones)

[27-Sep-19 04:50 PM] gcharang#6833
there is no other dex that supports as many coins, have a mobile gui, is fully decentralised(coins are always in the users' control)

[27-Sep-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> I also have tried atomic wallet (no success) and swaponline(works perfectly but low liquidity) (re @Regnar: There are other ones that are working on it too, ChainSwap, HyperDEX are both using the APIs and therefore sharing liquidity)

[27-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Atomicdex is a wallet first and foremost. It has an exchange feature (the AtomicAPI)

[27-Sep-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> That is not true, sir. I'm looking for atomic swap service far too long (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> there is no other dex that supports as many coins, have a mobile gui, is fully decentralised(coins are always in the users' control))

[27-Sep-19 04:53 PM] gcharang#6833
atomicDEX is the reiteration of our previous dex called barterDEX
you won't find a fully decentralised GUI dex before that

[27-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Try to do competitive analysis and check Liquality and Swap Online before saying such things (re @Regnar: There aren't really any atomic swap services. Atomic swaps are trust less, p2p swaps, where you maintain control of your keys the whole time. Most rely on a 3rd party you send funds to and trust they will swap your coins)

[27-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Anyway

[27-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Unfortunately many services claim to be atomic swaps, but do things like centralize swaps onto a side chain, in which you swap proxy tokens on a side chain. These are susceptible to gateway issues. 
Or they claim to be atomic swaps, but really just send your coins to a company like shapeshift and shapeshift buys your coins on an exchange and sends them back (re @deepblock: That is not true, sir. I'm looking for atomic swap service far too long)

[27-Sep-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> I will try to send some funds and try your wallet, then will get back to you with feedback

[27-Sep-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Please do. Remember it is beta so please only use amounts you are comfortable with (re @deepblock: I will try to send some funds and try your wallet, then will get back to you with feedback)

[27-Sep-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <deepblock> Testnet 💪
But funny thing - the Swap Online I've mentioned before has BCH in testnet version, but does not have BCH in mainnet
You should contact them for collaboration, I guess you both have something to share

[27-Sep-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
man, we have bch and btc on mainnet
the test coins is for people who are afraid to try

[27-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> ^ this.

[27-Sep-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea all the coins are Mainnet coins. Real BTC, ETH, KMD, DOGE, DASH, HUSH etc. They aren't the test nets of those coins. (re @deepblock: Testnet 💪
