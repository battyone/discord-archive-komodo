[telegram] <DD> It is 5% right? But this isnt 5% of my Komodo

[09-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <goldenman_kr> appr. 5% for 360 days (when you claim monthly) (re @DD: It is 5% right? But this isnt 5% of my Komodo)

[09-Feb-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sreinhardt> To add to what Goldenman said... the KMD has to be in your wallet the whole time and starting fairly recently (a month or two ago) you have to claim monthly to have it continue to build. You can't have it on an exchange for 6 months and then move it to your wallet to claim. In that case the exchange will be able to claim because they KMD have been in their wallet, not yours. (re @DD: It is 5% right? But this isnt 5% of my Komodo)

[09-Feb-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DD> Ah ok√© Thanks

[09-Feb-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DD> So its 5% For a whole year

[09-Feb-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DD> And After a year , Still 5% a year Or 5% a month ?

[09-Feb-19 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007
Total rate is ~5.1% per year if done monthly or more often

[09-Feb-19 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
it is 5% APR, when you claim the reward, you also accrue reward on the already claimed amount. in the end by compounding, you get ~5.1%

[09-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DD> Ah ok√© iT , i thought 5% monthly hehe

[09-Feb-19 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007
5% on any utxo that meets the requirements

When that is complete Komodo will be ahead of most other projects that are still trying to figure things out; I'm sure we'll hear a lot from marketing at that time also.

[telegram] <Glenn_CryptoPsychologist> I have been a hodler of Komodo for long time. Supporting would be a pleasure!! I have an idea to support. As a fan and believer I would love to support this way! ...As you guys may know, I work as a writer for Global Crypto News (GCN) , a new service of decentralized crypto news that we (the team of GCN) are building right now. During the month of February we might be able to publish an article written by Komodo team in our News WebSite (globalcryptonews.io). Also our GCN team may be able to promote the article during a couple of months. In this period, we are opening this special opportunity to publish for free, just for some weeks, during February. I promise I will recommend the publication to our GCN CEO, Stanford Saler and to our team. During this month I am almost sure we could publish and promote your article on various social media. In order to be able to get the article published, your team would only have to get in contact with our CEO and ask for the opportunity. Komodo deserves more and more exposure!! Once you write the article and we publish it, GCN will promote it, and of course it would be an honor for me to promote the article on my personal social media, specially in Twitter. I have some 1700 followers of our news. About 1k are Japanese (since I'm half Japanese, though I live in Costa Rica). It would be great if Komodo Team decided to publish now that we can get a free publication. I promise to try to help and to support as much as I can! For more information, I can DM of course!
