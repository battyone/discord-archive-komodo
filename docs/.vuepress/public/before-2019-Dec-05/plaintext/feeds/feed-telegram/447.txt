[telegram] <psyfont> Utxo means any amount I hold?

[24-Nov-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <psyfont> If yes, yes there are more than 10

[24-Nov-19 09:12 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
UTXO means the size of an unspent transaction such as 2 x 10 dollar bills = 2 UTXOs of $10

[24-Nov-19 09:13 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
total = $20 doesn't mean an UTXO of $20

[24-Nov-19 09:13 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the minimum UTXO to generate rewards = 10 kmd

[24-Nov-19 09:15 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the best way is to just send all amount to yourself

[24-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <psyfont> Ok, I‚Äôm not sure to understand at all...
So, I hold 500 kmd I sent to myself from coinomi in two times, some of these coins were also in chameleon were I claimed before transfer it to coinomi....

[24-Nov-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> maybe coinomi doesn't set locktime.. just send the complete amount of kmd inside chameleon to yourself (also chameleon)

[24-Nov-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> that combines utxo's and sets locktime

[24-Nov-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[24-Nov-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> Interesting dynamic is that BTC was falling during the last KMD rally

[24-Nov-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Good choice of words, "Rally" being the key one here. (re @EPIDEMIC_media: Interesting dynamic is that BTC was falling during the last KMD rally)

[24-Nov-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> BTC has a market beta of 1, like on the dot.

[24-Nov-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> KMD beta is 0.85.

[24-Nov-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So you should expect BTC to correlate well with the overall market, and KMD to correlate in similar direction but in lesser amount. BTC though is also the biggest on and off ramp for fiat, so it is usually the first mover.

[24-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There's also a very important, but hard to spot, difference in price decreasing or gains, either from change in demand for a coin, or simply BTC price swinging.
Most altcoins aren't trading against Fiat in any significant capacity, so when BTC price goes Up against USD, and altcoins stay stable to BTC, they also go up against USD.

[24-Nov-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If BTC goes down and alts stay stable against BTC, they also go down in USD. Without any selling off or anything like that. Simply because they are primarily priced in BTC

[24-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Or I should say, their USD equivalent is priced in the USD exchange rate to BTC

[24-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So some losses to BTC as expected, but most of the losses are in USD, because BTC was also losing to USD

[24-Nov-19 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
