[telegram] <Werxadler> I think dPOW fee is 300 kmd a year, but i think it will be raised the more projects will join... Maybe somebody can confirm (re @Greygoatz: I am curious how much coins have spent on protecting their chain with komodo.)

[05-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <LuckyBTC> You should update your firmware and Komodo app from Ledger live. (re @Brad: Not sure where that is.)

[05-Jul-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> I have simple question. How do KMD holders benefit from 0.15% transaction fees on AtomicDEX? Who exactly receives this transaction fee? Just Komodo Team? Or is there any mechanism in place that would see KMD holders actually receive anything from these transaction fees? If there is no benefit to KMD holders from these transaction fees, why hold KMD after all? http://decrypt.co/7749/komodo-releases-mobile-app

[telegram] <Brad> Ok I think I  did but not sure if I updated the komodo app separately .thx (re @LuckyBTC: You should update your firmware and Komodo app from Ledger live.)

[05-Jul-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
we are looking into making KMD work as BNB token does for the dexfees. so the more KMD you have, the lower the dexfees

[05-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
someone posted that idea and it seems a very good way

[05-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Please, make it possible for KMD holders to receive some direct/indirect benefits from transaction fees on AtomicDEX. Some kind of a mechanism. For instance, making it obligatory to pay that 0.15% transaction fee in KMD. All AtomicDEX users would then have to buy KMD and pay in KMD for their atomic swaps. This would bring indirect benefits to all KMD holders.

[05-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but that makes it so you need KMD to use it... i think better to give benefits if you have KMD, but not force people

[05-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> That would slow down the adoption then? (re @Cryppto: Please, make it possible for KMD holders to receive some direct/indirect benefits from transaction fees on AtomicDEX.

[05-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. if you have xyz coin and want to sell it for KMD, but you need KMD to be able to do it...

[05-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
you wouldnt be able to, over lack of 0.01 KMD

[05-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Him_Vichiet> Very good idea (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> someone posted that idea and it seems a very good way)

[05-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so just let people swap without restrictions. if they want 0.1% dexfee, they accumulate X amount of KMD, 0.09%, a bit more... maybe with enough KMD you can get a fixed 0.0001 dexfee

[05-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Him_Vichiet> Always give choice to user . But smart user will go for hold kmd

[05-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DigitalNinjaa> Thats a great idea and its not forced

[05-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Vollka_Racho> The ingenious thing is that if you start your project on komodo and want to be protected against 51% attacks (dPoW), you have to buy about 7000 kmd once and then pay the annual costs of the dPoW through the rewards (re @Werxadler: I think dPOW fee is 300 kmd a year, but i think it will be raised the more projects will join... Maybe somebody can confirm)

[05-Jul-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> All I am saying is that KMD holders should be somehow engaged in the financial results of Atomic DEX. Kind of shareholders of Atomic DEX, regularly participating in the income generated by Atomic DEX. The value of KMD would skyrocket if there was a direct/indirect mechanism of participating in the revenues coming from 0.15% fees. But it would mean KMD is a security. So there would be troubles in the USA.

[05-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so the security aspects are encapsulated in the DEX coin

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but i think giving a discount on dexfees would be ok, i guess it needs to be checked

[05-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Cryppto> Yep. It needs to be designed in a clever way. In the form of INDIRECT benefits for KMD holders that can not be exactly calculated. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> so the security aspects are encapsulated in the DEX coin)

[05-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Then buy Dex if you want to participate , holders took the risk held for years and should inherently benefit, this isn't central planning and income redistribution comrade (re @Cryppto: All I am saying is that KMD holders should be somehow engaged in the financial results of Atomic DEX. Kind of shareholders of Atomic DEX, regularly participating in the income generated by Atomic DEX.

[05-Jul-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Why not give such discount to dex holders , they placed money on the table to make dex possible and hodl with strong grip , (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> but i think giving a discount on dexfees would be ok, i guess it needs to be checked)

[05-Jul-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX benefits directly from dexfees

[05-Jul-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> yes and discount on top of that why not. Kmd should benefits only through pairing popularity and forced purchasing of earnings

[05-Jul-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Why negates Dex value for redistribution , like some commi

[05-Jul-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is tuned properly, it could increase atomicDEX usage

[05-Jul-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> It just seems like extracting from people who believed and watering it down to make everyone happy , fees will also be effected long run earnings will be reduced

[05-Jul-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Less capital to reinvest in community

[05-Jul-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> As long as it not 1000 kmd for 50%discount

[05-Jul-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the other idea was to give KMD trading pairs a bit of a discount

[05-Jul-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking 100,000 KMD for any big discounts

[05-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> There should be a cap at 30%at most

[05-Jul-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
let me think on this idea a bit, it is indeed a balancing between DEX hodlers and KMD

[05-Jul-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Yes but also know that short term price appraisal on kmd for such move will remove long term income which is much larger when taking reinvestment for new Devs ,projects etc

[05-Jul-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Also binance billion dollar valuation is based solely on just that nothing else

[05-Jul-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> So you cant compare to them , knd users are already have so much more benefits no need to waste more future resources

[05-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Just saw that seems much better idea lesser of two evils, I digress now (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> the other idea was to give KMD trading pairs a bit of a discount)

[05-Jul-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> That is more balanced

[05-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Although still it shouldn't be too generous no more than 30%

[05-Jul-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
balance based discounts do have some difficult to solve edge cases, much easier to make a KMD pair based discount. something like 10%, which isnt that much, but enough to motivate KMD based trades. BTC swapping will only make sense for large amounts anyway, due to txfees
