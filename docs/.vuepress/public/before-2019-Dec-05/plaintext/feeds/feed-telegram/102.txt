[telegram] <Daniel> ^ the stats from the test in May, which actually had bigger results

[14-Aug-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> Look at the tx/sec for 14:57 to about 15:12

[14-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> To my knowledge, we never hit 45,000 but I did see that figure posted on social media and in content created by community members. I"ll have to double check with the devs working on scaling stuff but I'm not sure if we ever got to 45K tps

[14-Aug-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Daniel> But we did have an incredible number of payments per second, over 800,000 payments/sec  for a minute or two

[telegram] <rene27> Uou said it

[14-Aug-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if 1 chain can do 100 tx/sec, 10,000 independent chains can do 1 million tx/sec. this is not so hard to believe

[14-Aug-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
just a matter of scale

[14-Aug-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is that using the notarized burn protocol, we can ensure the total coin supply across all chains stays constant, ie. they are fungible. it is sharding upside down. we combine independent chains at least enough to be able to prove any given txid was confirmed

[14-Aug-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be the actual blockchains with txids and all the usual data a blockchain has.

[14-Aug-18 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why there is any doubt whether this can be done or not

[telegram] <Regnar> Do yourself a favor and read the comments and you'll understand why it's an unfortunate FUD without any substance. Marc long abandoned responding to people asking for evidence because there is none. He simply slandered the project with lies and hid. I lost a lot of respect for him here. (re @LE: )

[14-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> the fact that Komodo is here is the very proof that what Marc wrote is false. jl777 has been working on this project since 2014, nothing has been abandoned

[14-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> Unfortunately he was fudded a lot because the overall project is composed of many parts and people fudded that each part was like a different project and that james was abandoning one for the other...
