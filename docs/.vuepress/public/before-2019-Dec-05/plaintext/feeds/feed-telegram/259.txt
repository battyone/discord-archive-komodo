[telegram] <PTYX11> that depends on the hashrate you generate on your hardware in proportion to the overall hashrate. You can also get KMD "staking" rewards by Holding KMD and claiming once a month.

[23-Mar-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Komodo has built a pretty unique way of driving value to KMD without locking people into KMD. Komodo believes locking people into a platform isn't a great idea long term, so locking into KMD isn't a thing. However, many of the value added like DEX coin mentioned pays out in KMD, it gets this KMD by collecting fees not in KMD, but in the currencies being traded (like BTC-LTC) then buys KMD on the open market with those fees and sends that KMD to DEX holders. 
This creates positive price pressure for KMD and drives value to it without forcing people who just want to trade non KMD coins, to buy KMD directly. This is counter to many platforms which force users to buy their coin in order to use a service, meaning the coin is a barrier to using a service. Komodo sees the service is the value, KMD shouldn't stand in the way, but gain afterwards (re @jojo: You need to own Kmd Dex to get the fees so it separate, will it add value  to kmd imo no but yes to ecosystem and users)
