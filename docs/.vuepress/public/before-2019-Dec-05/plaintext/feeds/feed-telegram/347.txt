Simple instructions to secure your funds: 
0) Search your address in https://kmdexplorer.io , if the funds are there, follow the next steps exactly. If not, follow the next steps to create a new wallet in Verus Agama and use it to submit a claim as described in the following post, if the funds have been swept to our team's address: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement
1) Download https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview 
2) It is safe
3) First, create a new wallet (new seed)
4) Note down the address
5) Then import the old seed (compromised), in the Verus Agama wallet and activate KMD lite mode. Then send all the funds to the new KMD address created previously
6) If you face "electrum error", "connection error" or "get_balance error", follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/ (re @Aircryptico: Thanks sir, do you suggest to create a new address and move founds to this?)

Doing that (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <gcharang> GLCNI01
