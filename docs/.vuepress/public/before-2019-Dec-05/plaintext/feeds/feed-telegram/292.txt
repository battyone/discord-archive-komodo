[telegram] <Instel7> Are you writing the seed correctly? If you're on a smartphone it's likely that your keyboard is capitalizing the first letter of each word (re @joejewson: hi there, could someone help me briefly with recovering a wallet using seed?

[09-May-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <joejewson> But a seed generates a key which creates an address as far as i understand right? So maybe the seed is making a new key and address instead of recovering an old one? I noticed before when i would login sometimes it would open a new wallet and i would have to log out again and then retry before it would load the right one... dont know if this is just me - its a little strange

[telegram] <Regnar> If you are copy and pasting from a word pad a lot of times it adds a space at the end. Try highlighting the seed and then hold shift and left arrow key. This should adjust the highlighted portion. If the full words are still covered the editor you put the seed in automatically added a space after you copy it (re @joejewson: I just found the wallet.dat files. Maybe putting them in the app data files in replacement of whatever is there will help?)

[09-May-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you generated the seed from lite mode, I dont think it will be in the wallet.dat. pretty sure that's native only. If you generated the seed in native it will be there. I would take a look at your seed and make sure you are typing it in perfectly, and that there are no extra spaces at the end of the seed (re @joejewson: But a seed generates a key which creates an address as far as i understand right?

[09-May-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
also they say 1 million tx/sec is our max, it isnt. the only limit is the number of chains you can launch

[09-May-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> You're actually limited by hardware, not by Komodo's code, right? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> also they say 1 million tx/sec is our max, it isnt. the only limit is the number of chains you can launch)

[09-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the limiting factor would be the amount of chains that can be notarized, but that is a matter to scaling up the NN or setting up a special cluster notarization. since 1 million tx/sec is way overkill for any usecase that we know of, there is plenty of time to ramp up the infrastructure. in any case, using AWS the scaleup can be done in a matter of days if absolutely needed

[09-May-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> When you say the limitation lies in the notarization structure, you mean a hardware limitation for the NN?

[09-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it would be hard to notarize 1 million chains on a single server

[09-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
would need a lot of servers to be notarizing that many chains
