[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> If you are feeling adventurous, you can also try out Atomic Dex

[03-Dec-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> There are a few others with deposits enabled but Bittrex is one of the biggest enabled right now.
You could try AtomicDEX as well, but only use small test amounts as the App is still in Beta. There are two test chains you can use (RICK and MORTY) that are valueless and have a Faucet if you don't want to your risk money. 
Or you can try other coins that are listed there, at your own risk. We really appreciate feedback especially if there were bugs or problems with a swap. That's why it's in Beta, so let us know. (re @unknown_star: so that means.... we can only transact on Bittrex until further notice ?)

Komodo $KMD dPoW is Pointless and Expensive

It provides 51% Attack Protection NO BETTER than the 10-Block Checkpointing system used by Bitcoin Cash (which is FREE)

Treasury holders should BUY BACK $KMD with whatever remains from the 2639 BTC ($18 Million)
