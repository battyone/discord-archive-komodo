[telegram] <Regnar> Yea it's pretty crazy we can't get more activity on twitter coming from telegram. (re @geeksri: Can't agree more with you regnar. We need to figure out how to get kmd Twitter and Telegram followers on board for word of mouth marketing)

[telegram] <Regnar> Pretty excited we have some Komodo Devs launching businesses that will help build upon the platform! providing new projects with exchange listings, payment processing, blockchain development, etc. Very cool!

KMD is already among the most under-valued things in the space, there's no real need to "increase the value"; we need to increase awareness
