[telegram] <Steingray> I want battle of the coins hosted by komodo. This is where many coins attempt to show solutions live in a hackathon like contest. Who could develop a working game using the blockchain first. Who can make a new chain. Who can make a secure contract quickest. Fastest atomic swaps.
