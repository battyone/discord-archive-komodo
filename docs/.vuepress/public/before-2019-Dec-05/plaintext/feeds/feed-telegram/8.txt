[13-Jun-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> nobody can bruteforce/guess words that are non existing

[13-Jun-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Hermes08> Remember that Agama creates for you a 24 word long seed passphrase  as default (re @BearTheTrader: i am creating a new wallet seed and i used 13 words invented by myself but when i click register it says “your seed is weak etc.” and does not let me use it)

[13-Jun-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763

i  created the wallet and i encrypted the seed using my original invented words and in 2/3 minutes i sent 5 kmd to test it all is ok

[13-Jun-18 06:30 AM] criptobear#6402
i tried before even with 24 words and did not work

[13-Jun-18 06:30 AM] criptobear#6402

[telegram] <BearTheTrader> why there is not a button to export wallet and or pin file?

[13-Jun-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> if you have your passphrase or private keys you will always have access to your wallet,  the wallet.dat file is located on your applications folder on MAC use shift + command and letter G  in your Finder and you will have access to the Komodo Folder where it is located.

[13-Jun-18 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> what about the pin?

[13-Jun-18 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Jun-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> well yes if you want' but the installation or uninstallation of Agama doesn't touches the Komodo folder... there are two different folders , uninstall and install only deals with Agama folder.

what other privacy coin has any annual awards? 5% was BTCD's rate, KMD inherited this. it seems a good rate, at 10% it is a high annual inflation rate
