[telegram] <Regnar> ALRIGHT EVERYONE!
Can I get a like and retweet please. Here's another of my targeted tweets in order to try and help a community push for Komodo.
I'm targeting Bruce Fenton. CEO and boardmember of many VC funds and blockchain groups including the Satoshi Roundtable. Bruce is a hardcore Atomic Swap fan and is part of the recent RavenCoin project. 
WanChain, AION network, and ICON for their interop teams trying to build Ops with multiple blockchain projects and help different chains communicate with each other. obviously this is a great fit with Komodo since we have MoMoM dPoW which helps Game Credits, Kreds, and other projects partnering with us.
 And of course, Good ole Charlie Lee, who needs no explanation or introduction.
So as Komodo community, I need you all to go out there click some buttons on twitter posts!!!

[telegram] <eMort667> In my opinion Komodo is the overall leader in tech (atomic swaps, scaling, security, etc.) and once cross chain smart contracts are in implemented Komodo will be out of reach of almost all other projects.
