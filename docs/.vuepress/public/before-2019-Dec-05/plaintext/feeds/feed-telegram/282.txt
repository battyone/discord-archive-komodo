[telegram] <Snail> Nice!! (re @Regnar: Check the Komodo year end report on the komodo website. There is marketing growth information in there (requested by community) 
It is a good time to start making people hungry, that's why Komodo is doing a rebrand. It's also why companies and projects building on Komodo are expanding their marketing too.)

[telegram] <efficientslacker> What is considered a healthy amount to hold for kmd?

[25-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <efficientslacker> Depends on ones financial situation but I‚Äôd like to know others opinions

[25-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Absolutely depends, as you said. Could always decide how many KMD you want to earn a day in rewards lol

[25-Apr-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> (Desired daily KMD * 365)/0.051 = KMD bag needed

[25-Apr-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> So (1 kmd a day * 365)/0.051 = 7,157 KMD
