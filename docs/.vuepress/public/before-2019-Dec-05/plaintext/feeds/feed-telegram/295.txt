[telegram] <Werxadler> Yes, all other coins did quite good while btc dominance went from 50 to 60% 🤦‍♂️ (re @TheoHx: In all honesty, worst performing coin I’ve ever bought. But I still love the project. Tough situation)

[telegram] <TheoHx> not all coins have had a 9 week depression, facts are facts (re @Werxadler: Yes, all other coins did quite good while btc dominance went from 50 to 60% 🤦‍♂️)

[telegram] <pungoio> Seems binance is afraid not to be able to cover user withdrawals and get even a bigger withdrawal pressure if they start delaying on payments, so seems they are buying btc like crazy xD

[telegram] <Werxadler> Ok, in 9 weeks we went from rank 53 to 54 on coinmarketcap,  and value raised over 20% in Dollar (re @TheoHx: not all coins have had a 9 week depression, facts are facts)

[13-May-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> dont know what chart you are looking at but i see a 0% gain against dollar within the past 9 weeks, but if you count that spike..we are sitting at 28% loss from 1.54

[telegram] <Werxadler> Snapshot march 10th 92 Cent, now 113 Cent (re @TheoHx: dont know what chart you are looking at but i see a 0% gain against dollar within the past 9 weeks, but if you count that spike..we are sitting at 28% loss from 1.54)

[telegram] <Werxadler> Bitcoin dominance was at 51,5 %, so for me komodo is doing not too bad, except you wanted the Quick gain and bought at the peak

[14-May-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you install the new version and had previously used a password with a saved seed, those will still work. If you previously had used your seed to login lite mode you can still do that but under the restore setting. This will let you use your seed and then save that seed and secure it with a password, so that you can login with that password alone.

[14-May-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
