[telegram] <Regnar> But generally that is why often it is slow to start channels specific to certain regions, we don't have enough available admins with the language skills.

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Thank you mate. I can open Turkish channel with a big pleasure but I am not patient person as you for stupid and repetition questions. So have no enough features to be admin. (re @Regnar: So these channels are all community run actually. Many of the Admins are also on the team or moderators, but the telegram channels are all community run. So if you wanted to lead the Turkish channel you are welcome to start it! I think we would need more admins who could speak the language to be helpful though, this is a 24 hour thing so it's nice to be geographically separated.)

[telegram] <EPIDEMIC_media> wallets were disabled about 3 weeks ago for an upgrade. Binance support says they do not have a time table on when service will be restored to normal. (re @unknown_star: guys ? did deposits stop on binance ? what hapenned exactly there)

[telegram] <Adriana39> Hello

[03-Dec-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <unknown_star> so that means.... we can only transact on Bittrex until further notice ? (re @EPIDEMIC_media: wallets were disabled about 3 weeks ago for an upgrade. Binance support says they do not have a time table on when service will be restored to normal.)
