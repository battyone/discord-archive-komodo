[telegram] <tetragraam> Does Komodo do peer to peer swaps?

[27-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FDRich> @zaher I think Komodo was the first to do an atomic swap and has been hitting it hard for a while. What‚Äôs your question

[27-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptoyusef> Do they do peer to peer swaps (re @FDRich: @zaher I think Komodo was the first to do an atomic swap and has been hitting it hard for a while. What‚Äôs your question)

[27-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptoyusef> I believe is his question

[27-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FDRich> Not sure anyone can right now. It took a team for Komodo to do theirs. I believe

[27-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jmpout> peer to peer swaps = atomic swaps = yes, komodo does (re @tetragraam: Does Komodo do peer to peer swaps?)

[27-Aug-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptoyusef> Do you have a user interface where one can preform an atomic swap? (re @jmpout: peer to peer swaps = atomic swaps = yes, komodo does)

[27-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FDRich> Zaher there has to be a ui you can just do one yourself. Maybe a link

[27-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FDRich> I‚Äôm sure Komodo has a ui peer to peer link. Just use it with a friend

[27-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptoyusef> I don‚Äôt see that anywhere

[27-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jmpout> i think barterdex or when hyperdex comes out (sorry, i'm not up2date) (re @cryptoyusef: Do you have a user interface where one can preform an atomic swap?)

[27-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptoyusef> So this isn‚Äôt really peer to peer (re @jmpout: i think barterdex or when hyperdex comes out (sorry, i'm not up2date))

[27-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tetragraam> I found the link from Lamden, but does Komodo have a web interface where I can do a peer to peer Swap?

[27-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tetragraam> Aah (re @cryptoyusef: So this isn‚Äôt really peer to peer)

[27-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jmpout> barterdex is a decentralized exchange, with direct atomic swaps between peers (re @cryptoyusef: So this isn‚Äôt really peer to peer)

[27-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FDRich> Well they‚Äôve done peer to peer dude. I mean everyone knows it. You and a friend can swap a coin without Komodo being involved. Maybe research it. Idk (re @cryptoyusef: I don‚Äôt see that anywhere)

[27-Aug-18 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tetragraam> Aah how can I explain, from what I have found and understood by Lamden swaps no one is involved except the peers but Komodo u must do it trough thier dex

[telegram] <tetragraam> I think it's a fork of btc for gambling (re @Gudneh: This coin CHIPS that's on the barterDEX. What will it's purpose be?)

[27-Aug-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Gudneh> I see

[27-Aug-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tetragraam> I am not sure if this blockchain will become the "real" CHIPS, but I would tend to guess that it would. Privatebet (BET komodo assetchain) is implementing a generic decentralized gaming platform and will be using CHIPS for the internal ledger of the in-game betting results. However, specific plans are subject to change until it is all finalized.
Since the casino games will have a relatively short lifetime, as long as the market price of CHIPS does not change very quickly, people can purchase CHIPS to use inside the games and them redeem them via barterDEX at close to the same price. Maybe even some time limited pricelocking can be implemented with CLTV.
This is really more of an internal component for the komodo ecosystem, but I announce in here so that it cannot be claimed that it was done in secret. Of course it is all in my github and fully public even during the development phase.
Oh, there wont be any ICO for CHIPS. Not looking for any funding, we have plenty of that. However, if you want to actively participate in the development or testing, then certainly we need as many people for that as possibl (re @Gudneh: I see)
