yes, all 1080 KMD that ASIC miners mine each day, 100% of this is sold and it turns into 1 million KMD worth of sell pressure every day. it is quite amazing

[13-Mar-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
back to reality. odds are less than half of what is mined is sold immediately, so that is approx 500 KMD of sell pressure. against what trading volume is the "damp it" happening? Please try to use math, it does help
