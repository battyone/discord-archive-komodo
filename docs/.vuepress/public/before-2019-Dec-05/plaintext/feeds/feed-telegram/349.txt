[telegram] <polycryptoblog> If you have been following developments closely why do you cite things from years ago, why ignoring the  dico have been done and completed like Utrum .  Prior to the brown sheet video Komodo did not have a marketing team and since efforts have demonstrably improved.    Can you even name any technology that Komodo has released in the past year?

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> I am not sure about about top 10 time but quite sure that kmd chart is looking awesome now. So according to me it gonna be minimum 3 usd in a few weeks. 
If there will be a real altparty then I will not be suprised to see kmd price on 60-80 usd level until 2021. That is why I am holding it and try to increase my kmd amount everyday. (re @Steven: I have been here for a long time 
And follow developments closely 
KMD talk a big game
I remember the massive sell off after the brown curtain announcement 
The failed dicos 
As an investor and long time holder the latest wallet issue 
Is worrisome 
I mean it‚Äôs such a competitive market out there 
I mean how far are we from getting to a point where we see 
Kmd in the top 10 ?)

[telegram] <yorklab> Everything is hackable; even Binance got hacked! What's important is how the team responds to such events. I don't think another project out there would have been capable of acting as swiftly as Komodo did. They have also started the refund process quickly. For me this instills even more confidence in Komodo, and looking at the price of KMD it seems the market agrees. (re @Steven: I have been here for a long time

i got the refund processor coded and it will be sending out the first 90 refunds over the next hour or so. about half the claims for less than 777 KMD have properly sent the special tx 2) to the secure refund address. this is approx 10% of the affected users, so not a bad start. assuming there are no issues, the rest can be processed as soon as the proper claims are made with a matching send from the old address to the new secure address.

by the way, the refund processor is 500 lines of C code

Update Regarding Vulnerability Discovered in Komodo's Agama Wallet
A vulnerability was recenly discovered in Komodo's version of Agama wallet. Read this post to learn more about the vulnerability and the coming solutions.
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/update-regarding-agama-vulnerability.jpg

[09-Jun-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
to speed up the reclaim process it's necessary that you follow the steps in this article:
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

once you do, then all claims for smaller amounts can be automatically processed on the blockchain, assuming there are no disputes

[09-Jun-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Mixic> I'm glad the Komodo team reacted very quickly to the problem. Now the coins have returned to the new address. I thank the whole team, you're the cool guys! üòäüëç

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to be clear, if your address had less than 777 KMD swept, and you didnt receive a refund, but you received the dust to the old address. the holdup for the refund is the transaction you need to send from the old address to the new address: 

https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

I will run the refund processor daily for a while, so if you dont get your tx done before i start the refund processor, you will need to wait another day. Also if you have a larger amount, we need to wait a bit more time to make sure there are no disputes. and if your funds were not swept, but stolen, you need to wait and additional week.

it does take a long time to run the refund processor as i didnt code it for efficiency. i will process progressively larger and larger amounts during the week and will post the most recent cutoff value. that way you dont have to keep asking when your refund will be processed. until you send in your dust tx from old address to new address and i process refunds bigger than your refund, your refund wont be processed.

[09-Jun-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
plz post in social media that you got your funds back!
