[telegram] <Kobra369> Lite mode, I don‚Äôt understand the instructions to update de wallet ü§ï (re @Hermes08: What do you mean you cannot update it? The new Mac version is a portable version . Are you trying to use native or lite mode?)

[15-Sep-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> As long as you have your seed written down you have possession of your private keys and for this reason of your coins

[15-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can download the new version and launch it in lite mode it won't make any type of difference if you do it

[15-Sep-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kobra369> One more question
If we keep the kmd in ledger we can get the airdrop and rewards?

[15-Sep-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> You can get airdrops , in regards to the rewards I will recommend using Agama for this matter is easier to use.

[15-Sep-18 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> Always just keep your seed and get your private keys for Agama in order to have a double security measure... Here are some guides from Agama for you to see https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/260177948/SPV+LITE+MODE

[telegram] <Matt> ETP is ethash .. sits closer to ETH .. but all coins based on ETP are on-chain. As with KMD every coin has it own independed blockchain.. wich is better for scalability (re @RektRick: cons and pros vs metaverse ETP please)

gee whiz, who woould have thought that people would have to generate revenue and have their own capital to attract outside investment. Most ICO's have been a scam since day one. And everyone involved in these scams needs to get the fuck on anyway
