[telegram] <TheoHx> You are correct, it would @Matterbridge_kmdbot it would be smart to hold off on advertising until the re-brand, at the same time it is a marathon, not a sprint. Im not talking about pay-per-click or personal spend. I was talking more about partnerships and working with media outlets to get things published on their channels. For instance, getting community champions to write competitive articles or paying someone in KMD could post an article highlighting differences between say Monero and KMD..Doing comparison articles expands the SEO beyond your scope because it captures both parties and you relay on the news outlets user base to spread the word

[25-Mar-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> every media outlet want free content, you just have to provide it

[25-Mar-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
what world are you living in? 90%+ of articles are pay for placement

[25-Mar-19 08:31 PM] jl777c#5810
why would they bother with free content when they can get paid for it??

[25-Mar-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are some small websites that are desperate for content, but how much would that help us?

[25-Mar-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that there are hundreds of projects with 10x to 100x our funding, that are in the same market for media coverage

[25-Mar-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <TheoHx> the world i live in...the journalist gets paid to write the story because the news company wants readers

[25-Mar-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810

[telegram] <TheoHx> i was not aware

[25-Mar-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and everybody thinks we are idiots for not getting the free press coverage

[25-Mar-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
now, komodo has so much newsworthy things, that we do occasionally get free placements

[25-Mar-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and we work hard to achieve this

[25-Mar-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
the pay for placement stuff is usually not that effective anyway.

[telegram] <Regnar> EVERYONE! You can help Komodo by sharing the content we put out. Every Tuesday we put out a tech article about what has been worked on the past week. We also have AMAs and 5 bullet Fridays. New content every week! 
If you feel like paying for advertising, feel free to raise funds and pay to promote some of these articles, but as it's been stated, it's a negative ROI.
Better would be to share them in relevant circles to the content. For example sharing Game centered articles in game dev channels, or supply chain stuff on LinkedIn with supply companies, etc. Word of mouth also is huge.
Here's where the new articles are posted:

why are you not with natasha and the daily 8%? guaranteed! giving away something is a bit different than paying for something else. you seem quite confused. usury is collecting very large interest rates, what does that have to do with anything??

BTCD was $1 or so, and got 50 KMD so that is 2 cents price for KMD. from that to $1 in 4 years is not bad, even after the bear

while it isnt 3% compounded everyday, from the 4yrs ago price, it is actually averaging about 3% per day for 4 years, assuming I am remembering prices correctly. but the market doesnt go in a straight line, it tends to go a bit like dampened harmonic oscillators for a while, then gets a jolt and starts oscillating again. about as far from a straight line as you can get
