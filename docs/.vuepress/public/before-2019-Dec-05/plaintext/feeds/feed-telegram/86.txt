[telegram] <Starcevic> are rewards autoclaimed?

[04-Aug-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to make a transaction at least once a month,  starting at block 1 million. If you do not make a transaction the rewards will stop accruing until you do.

[04-Aug-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <icantgiveyou> But basically claiming interest once a month should suffice correct? (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <blackjok3r> You need to make a transaction at least once a month,  starting at block 1 million. If you do not make a transaction the rewards will stop accruing until you do.)
