[16-Nov-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <hansiharjunharja> I have been reading a bit about mimblewimble as Litecoin is going to implement it. Charlie Lee said that it even helps with todays speed of Litecoinand returns fungibility to it.
I am no pro in mathematics, and I don't know if anyone can answer me, but wouldn't it be possible to add mimblewimble to KMD as a chain that works together with the mainchain and bring this option to Komodo, too IF Charlie Lee succeeds and if it looks like LTC may this way stay on all major exchanges.

[16-Nov-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
