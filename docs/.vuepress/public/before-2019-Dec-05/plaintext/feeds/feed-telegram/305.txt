[telegram] <jessecouch> Has it ever happened before that a coin got delisted from bittrex & then switched onto Komodo atomic swaps as the main trading pair?

[25-May-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <rainbowpiez> Even if Satoshi was a group of people, even if satoshi is actually dead, he was anonymous for a reason. It was an ideology that is satoshi. The komodo team and jl777 have stayed true that ideology.

[telegram] <Seko1900> This week at The HempCoin:
- Created Outline of grower data required for HempTRAC.
- The Komodo migration process will be simple. THC is entirely safe and secured. Although Bittrex is hosting the change there is no need to move ANY coins other the zTHC to THC in current wallets. The Atomic Komodo migration will include all private keys from the current chain to the new THC. All coins are fine exactly where they are currently. 
- The decision to halt wallets was NOT the exchanges but was our decision. We are overly cautious to maintain the highest security therefore all wallets on all exchanges are turned off. 
- t.me/HempCoinOfficial
- The date will be announced next week. This is a HUGE advantage for THC. Our new Smart Contract structured technology will allow for ‚ÄúSeed to Sale‚Äù HempTRAC. 
- This is the beginning of an EPIC payment/transaction platform to transform the way the Agriculture/farming/Cannabis industry operates. (re @I am Groot !!!: Thxzüëç)
