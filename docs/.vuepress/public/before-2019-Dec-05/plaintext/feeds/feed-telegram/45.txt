[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> okex is usually fine with 100-200k$, if also around 10-20,000 user join their exchange and deposit on average 2-3ETH (re @Regnar: yea that's not a bad idea, I think the dev funds should obviously be used for business reasons. but if the community wants to raise funds for exchange listings, why not. Just might be a bit difficult to raise a Million dollars lol)

[08-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> wait, as part of the stipulation? (re @HMod_STULLE: okex is usually fine with 100-200k$, if also around 10-20,000 user join their exchange and deposit on average 2-3ETH)

[08-Jul-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> yep

[08-Jul-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt 10,000 to 20,000 ETH quite a lot?

[08-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> 1 time fee is cool, but longterm trading fees are better

[08-Jul-18 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
they charge both

[08-Jul-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> yes, but nobody has to use that ETH to buy anything. it only needs to be deposited. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> isnt 10,000 to 20,000 ETH quite a lot?)

[08-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> also lets not forget how difficult it was for Verge to raise even $1MM (pretty sure they didn't get 1m from their own community) and Komodo has 1/4 of their telegram users and like 1/3rd their twitter followers

[08-Jul-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> therefor, yes its alot of money, but its easier to raise than 5m$ for binance or however much they charge currently

[08-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <HMod_STULLE> that being sad, i dont see a issue in terms of liquidity for KMD right now. binance, bittrex, upbit and cryptopia are pretty solid exchanges

[08-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yea just not sure we have 20K (non US) users who are willing to put that much money on a centralized exchange...

[08-Jul-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> agreed, and I did a rough calculation and see over half of KMD is not on any centralized exchanges (at least in that snapshot of time)

[08-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Matt> I mine ETH to bittrex.. tradingpair with KMD.. easy.. then sending to agame wallet.

[08-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <J> BarteDex still needs to smooth out the process:reliability of providing liquidity. I think when it works (like with Beer/Pizza) it’s amazing, but I’ve yet to see that type of reliability when paired with other coins. I think it’s close, but I’m still wary to get crypto noobs to try it and expect much more than frustration. (re @Cabey: BarterDEX is operational and does more than beer and pizza. HyperDEX is launching soon.)

[08-Jul-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> yea it's still in Beta and pretty sure hyper is still in alpha, but the atomic swap process moves smoothly when there is liquidity (abstract term, what is the right amount or too little liquidity depends on the trades wanting to be made I guess) (re @J: BarteDex still needs to smooth out the process:reliability of providing liquidity.

[telegram] <J> Atomic swap process works well, but let’s distinguish between atomic swaps and actually getting a match.  If you don’t get a marketmatch, you don’t get to experience the atomic swap.  I would also respectfully disagree that it isn’t just a matter of setting up LP and getting more bobs. That might average out to “more success” by sheer number of attempts, but I think beta more accurately describes where BarterDex presently is. It’s important not to delude ourselves with its performance and acknowledge its present status. Note the vast numbers of Assetchains being swapped, which is fantastic. However, barely a fraction of the atomic swaps are for any other coins. I don’t think that’s simply a matter of too few LPs, but some kinks that still need to be weeded out. I’m confident they will, but at the same time don’t want people to get the idea that it’s simply an LP numbers thing and then be disappointed when it doesn’t improve as much as expected. (re @Regnar: yea it's still in Beta and pretty sure hyper is still in alpha, but the atomic swap process moves smoothly when there is liquidity (abstract term, what is the right amount or too little liquidity depends on the trades wanting to be made I guess))

[09-Jul-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> The reason why there are no swaps outside of Komodo pairs is because Noone is providing Liquidity for them. I'm not saying LP nodes will solve the issue but it will guarantee order books are filled and increase usability of the Dex. Which is what we need. We already have the friendly ux/ui that appeals users. Marketmaker 2.0 will increase performance and add many functionalities but it's some time away.

[09-Jul-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> When you say kinks that need to be worked out. Which kinks are you referring to exactly that are hindering swaps of non-kmd pairs?

[09-Jul-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYTrader> It seems we are getting spammed

[09-Jul-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> I have LP nodes running, they have gotten a few swaps here and there running at market rate. I’m just saying it doesn’t land squarely on the fact that there are few LPs. The ones that are there aren’t being used much if at all.  I see that there are are a few possible reasons for this. 1. BarterDex is a little tricky to use. 2. No LPs (I’ve just explained this isn’t entirely true) 3. LPs and Clients have some issues preventing efficient market matching. 
I feel 3. Is likely the biggest issue right now and as you said, hopefully mm2.0 will be the main thing that will help with that. (re @PTYTrader: The reason why there are no swaps outside of Komodo pairs is because Noone is providing Liquidity for them.

[09-Jul-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Kinks, primarily having the right UTXOs, pricing etc but then match still won’t happen.

[09-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Having to use swapstatus to nudge trades forward. Why is this even necessary? Is it that resource intensive to just periodically (like once a minute?) call this automatically, or is it destructive in some way if called prematurely?
