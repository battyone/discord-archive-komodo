[telegram] <Regnar> "this will allow users to send funds to one another‚Äôs handles. Rather than entering an ordinary address of random numbers and letters, Dilithium users will simply enter handles into a GUI and click send. If James ‚Äòjl777‚Äô Lee chose to use the handle ‚Äújl777‚Äù and registered that to his Dilithium public key, then you could send funds to ‚Äújl777‚Äù and they would be transferred directly to his wallet in a quantum-secure fashion."

[telegram] <Mckinley> Good weekend! I found a group lately called @TheHouseOfChimera which was shared in this group a few days ago. I did join them and i made my first profit on BNB and QKC! I'm obviously quite happy with this, and that is why i spread the word as good gesture! They only give calls on Binance and Bitmex, no pump or dump scams.
