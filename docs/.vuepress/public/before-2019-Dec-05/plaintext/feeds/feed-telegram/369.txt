[22-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> If the government wants you to work 20 hours a day, and you don't they can ban your addresses

[22-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Control is important to governments. Key is to keep most of the population to a level where they can just support themselves, and bring in th emoney for the government. Having too many rich people makes the job carrousel stall, causing less income. (re @tobiasnunes: So it's a way to make sheep's out of people)

[22-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> They can enslave us, and we should think well how to prevent that to happen.

[22-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> Not everyone can be rich that's true. I think everyone can have a good life though. And we are not talking here about normal jobs. A bad government can decide that it is necessary to have a lot of soldiers that work 20 hours a day, or that clean a radio active city. Who does not do will get in trouble

[22-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> But it can also be a way to prevent opinions about politics and stuff. It's important to keep that in mind

[22-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> If I were rich I would leave my country and go live somewhere else. No more taxes for them. (re @tobiasnunes: Not everyone can be rich that's true.
