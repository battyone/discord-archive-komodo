@SatoshiLite When you're ready to check out @KomodoPlatform and @HyperDEXApp let us know. Cross chain atomic swaps from wallets with private keys that ONLY YOU ACTUALLY OWN. @VitalikButerin you know what's up too.

[telegram] <Regnar> then apparently Bancor was able to "freeze" the wallet from sending the BNT it stole...soooooo it's so decentralized that one wallet controls a bunch of smart contracts and can drain them at will, and the whole network can freeze peoples funds
