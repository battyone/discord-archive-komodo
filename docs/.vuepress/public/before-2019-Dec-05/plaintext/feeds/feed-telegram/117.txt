Komodo is PoW, you can mine it

[telegram] <KammerBrand> It's not impossible 😉 (re @Jamlite: Komodo will need to be the same market cap as bitcoin cash to be $100 a coin)

[25-Aug-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Jamlite> Only possible if Komodo becomes adopted as a dapp platform (re @KammerBrand: It's not impossible 😉)

[25-Aug-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> no, BTC is 115 billion (12 digits), KMD is 100 million roughly (9 digits).. so 100 dollars is 10 billion market cap, or 11 digits.. it could be closer to the market cap or Ripple or 30% of the current Eth market cap (re @KammerBrand: It's not impossible 😉)

[telegram] <mo7881> All crypto is about 200 billion - it will hopefully get to 2 trillion during the next bubble. KMD could easily hit 100 dollars

Too many coins!!!

[25-Aug-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <mo7881> All the big crypto moves are timed around the BTC halvenings.. im not expecting anything to move until mid 2020 during the next one. If we get another bubble like last year it will be good times for KMD holders

[26-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kaichichow> Dont forget that as whole marketcap grows so do individuals. Quite a few useless or undeserving projects have hit 10b marketcap. Tron verge qtum and a few others were there in the bullrun. A lot were in the 8 to 10b (re @Jamlite: Only possible if Komodo becomes adopted as a dapp platform)

[26-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kaichichow> So its definately not hard to see komodo hit those levels as people discover our tech, as we rebrand, and as we wait for next alt season

You will not receive any reward if you hold your Komodo in exchanges, pools and Ledger HW wallet. Keep 10 KMD or more in an address under your control, where you own the privkey for the address.

VRSC is basd on komodod and it had an estimated 10,000+ nodes recently. it uses the bitcoin protocol code that was in zcash, which got it from 0.11 bitcoin. so whatever node limits bitcoin has, which is unlimited

I just  came across an article that mentioned about ZK-STARKs (transparent zero knowledge) & just started reading , seems interesting, I'm wondering how  ZK-STARKs could benefit Komodo, as ZK-STARKs requires less computation time than ZK-SNARKs
