[04-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763

Smart contracts, based on "cryptocondition", are coming very soon to the Komodo platform. 

Combined with our #Bitcoin-level security, #Zcash-level privacy, and our already working interoperability (#atomicswaps & #MoMoM), $KMD is shaping up very well for developers.
