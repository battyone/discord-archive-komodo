what? you mean the price of Zcash and KMD are not in lockstep? they are actually independent? and you paint this as a negative. also +10% isnt exactly moon territory and what did zcash do the other week when KMD went up 30%? If they were in lockstep, KMD wouldnt be able to go up in price without ZEC going up

show the KMD chart over the same timeframe

let us see what your point really is

[20-Mar-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I see, KMD is almost double from the same start point, while ZEC is down over 50%. is that what you mean?
