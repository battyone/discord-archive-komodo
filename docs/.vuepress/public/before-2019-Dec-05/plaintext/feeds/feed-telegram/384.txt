Antara & Rebrand AMA
Antara Framework & Rebrand AMA July 2nd, 2019    Komodo is an open, modular multi-chain platform with blockchain development roots going back to 2014. Since Komodo is a fork of Zcash, it started its journey as a privacy-oriented project, but has since expanded far beyond that...

[telegram] <CryptoCouple17> KMD Update
FA: KMD is doing very well due to the spotlight the project is in at the moment. Being in the final stage of a rebranding process and having multiple product releases like the Antara framework with their Smart Chains on the 15th of July, Komodo aims to be ready for adoption. Being the top performer of the last couple of days the interest is still rising.
TA: From the technical perspective we can see that KMD performed ahead of our indicators. Target 1 & 2 have been hit with the nail on the head and showed some anticipated resistance. You should have locked-in an average profit of over 20% so far. While writing this we can see Bitcoin is moving upwards which lets the price slip a little bit. However, being ahead of time, you can decide to split the last portion aiming for Target 3 and let the rest ride towards the due date (15/07/19).  Being a very irrational market we might go higher, but expect a bumpy road as we're already in the green.

[telegram] <Ra> Much better KMD and DEX holders benefits a mutually beneficial relationship (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> balance based discounts do have some difficult to solve edge cases, much easier to make a KMD pair based discount. something like 10%, which isnt that much, but enough to motivate KMD based trades. BTC swapping will only make sense for large amounts anyway, due to txfees)

[telegram] <McAttack77> so just to make sure I'm understanding correctly.  If I have a verus wallet setup with my funds.  I can tap into atomic dex to trade my assets via atomic swap?  Or is the atomic dex a wallet in and of itself that I need to hold my assets in?

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> üëèüëèüëèüëè (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [discord] <jl777c> so just let people swap without restrictions. if they want 0.1% dexfee, they accumulate X amount of KMD, 0.09%, a bit more... maybe with enough KMD you can get a fixed 0.0001 dexfee)

[telegram] <TomKron> what will happen when KMD will hit Max Supply of 200.000.000 KMD ? 
If erveryone claim the 5% KMD REWARDs per Year then there will be around 5,6 Million KMD Tokens generated every Year and you will hit the MAX Supply theoretically in 8-12 Years
Ethereum Mining generates around 9,7 Million Eth every Year and has unlimited Max supply 
Bitcoin mining generates 657.000BTC every year and is decerasing after every 3 years or so to half, BTC Will Hit max supply in 100 Years.

KMD inflation currently is a bit under 5%

[05-Jul-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that is on the low side of most coins

however

[05-Jul-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
those that are actively claiming rewards, actually get a bit of negative inflation!
