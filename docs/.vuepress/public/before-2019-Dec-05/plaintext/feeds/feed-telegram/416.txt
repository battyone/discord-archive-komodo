[telegram] <torsten1> You make me confused

[24-Oct-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude  your excuses is it’s beta.... let’s get passed beta and talk about real numbers

[24-Oct-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Where is the volume gonna come from

[24-Oct-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> ?

[24-Oct-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Right now on the biggest exchange we have 23 btc volume

[24-Oct-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> How does KMD become top coin

[24-Oct-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We are working on a liquidity pool tool where anyone can become a liquidity provider and profit from the spreads. You bet we are 100% aware that the success of AtomicDEX — any DEX for that matter — depends on liquidity. There are many things in the background you don’t know about.

[24-Oct-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Will it be a roaring success? We will see. But rest assured you are not the smartest person in the room, literally EVERYONE knows liquidity HAS to be solved

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> We are not there yet. We are building, it’s an early beta.

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Lol who said I was the smartes (re @torsten1: Will it be a roaring success? We will see. But rest assured you are not the smartest person in the room, literally EVERYONE knows liquidity HAS to be solved)

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Well you certainly act like it ;)

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude don’t shove fucking words down anyone’s mouth

[24-Oct-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Never said you said that, chill down

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Rest assured your not the smartest In the room

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Like you insult

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> There are three ways to solve liquidity on a DEX:
1. Tapping into CEX order books
2. Creating liquidity pools (most of the ETH-based exchanges do this)
3. Hire market makers

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> To get a point proven

[24-Oct-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> we are exploring all of them

[24-Oct-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> When I answered the question at hand

[24-Oct-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Let me know when you finished your snowflake rant and let's discuss liquidity

[24-Oct-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Liquidity tools haven’t helped eth based exchanges with volume (re @torsten1: There are three ways to solve liquidity on a DEX:
1. Tapping into CEX order books
2. Creating liquidity pools (most of the ETH-based exchanges do this)
3. Hire market makers)

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Snowflake (re @torsten1: Let me know when you finished your snowflake rant and let's discuss liquidity)

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Lol not liberal

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> And don’t have to insult you

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I kinda disagree, Uniswap, Kyber, etc have decent volumes (re @Bar_Harbor: Liquidity tools haven’t helped eth based exchanges with volume)

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> To make a point

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Hahaha

[24-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Rest assured you are most def not the smartest person

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> bla bla

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Ahaha

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Can we continue?

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Yeah how much volume does kyber have

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> ...

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I think liquidity pools do work, but there are 2 other options as well

[24-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I can swap thousands of dollars worth of USDC to ETH for example any time on Kyber

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Obviously smaller coins have less liquidity

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> What is the volume

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Not what you can do with it

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> How many people use it

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> We can if you stop insulting

[24-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I guess you can google it?

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Lol (re @torsten1: I guess you can google it?)

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude really you can google it

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> The point is pools are very useful to create liquidity

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Jesus

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Really who uses them (re @torsten1: The point is pools are very useful to create liquidity)

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Amount of people

[24-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> ?

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> If no one uses them

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Are the useful

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I don't know, do you? Kyber has bigger volume than Binance DEX, you can look that up on Coingecko

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> But how good Kyber is it's not the point, the point is how to create liquidity on a DEX

[24-Oct-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I believe there are 3 ways to do that

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Happy to hear your thoughts

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Binance dex isn’t a dex

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Kyber has no volume dude no dex does

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Why is that

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> OK, I am listening

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Why if you control your keys control your security

[24-Oct-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> What do you think about DEXes and trading on DEXes?

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> I think dexes need better interface for ignorant people to use it (re @torsten1: What do you think about DEXes and trading on DEXes?)

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I agree 100%

[24-Oct-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> That would not solve liquidity, though, it's a chicken and egg problem

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Liquidity will come with volume

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> ??

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> We need marketing and amazing products out on social media and tv

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> And tele adds

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> well if there's no liquidity people won't trade there —> no volume —> no people

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Liquidity will come with volume

[24-Oct-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> OK so if I understand it right, you recommend for AtomicDEX to do TV ads

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> No lol

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> That's an interesting idea, will discuss with the team

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude binance got so big

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> It had no volume

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> When it started

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> But marketing no kyc

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> Do you remember why Binance got that big?

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <torsten1> I do

[24-Oct-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Yes because of marketing and less trading fees with more coins

[24-Oct-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bar_Harbor> Dude there were billboards in New York for eos
