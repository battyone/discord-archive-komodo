[telegram] <cloudyoncall> when i put an order in on hyperdex, it comes back unmatched. how do i get an order to just stay in the books? i don't understand... can you not sell something unless someone is actively buying in that moment? can you not put a sell in so that say, tomorrow, someone can go and buy it?

[13-Jun-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> If you're trying to be a Bob, selling something, then I think certain things have to be set up first.
