[telegram] <dark_carp> I would like to measure interest in getting a fiat off ramp for komodo via Blockcard which is a VISA debit card.  If you spend over 750 USD/ month it would be free to use in credit card type purchasing.  I use the card  (currently available in US, but adding 150 other nations in the next six months), and it has been without issues.  They currently accept 13 cryptos for deposit and convert it to Ternio (TERN)  while you wait to make your purchases.  I wanted to see if komodo could be the 14th option for funding the card.
