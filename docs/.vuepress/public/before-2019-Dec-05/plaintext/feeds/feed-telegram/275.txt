[telegram] <alexandre> I m buying... but for me it s not the best moment. Normally the bitcoin will go up to 5800 and then go down to 2500. The problem is that kmd doesnt follow the bitcoin in is upper movement.

[telegram] <Keytothegate> IMO Elliott waves are mostly speculation, of course you can draw some nice patterns afterwards but estimating future price movements based on this is quite speculative at best and there are better indicators ta-wise to be used..

[15-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> I am not against elliott waves, just it's endless swamp and if you are trading with longer time frame you need to ignore fundamental analysis even more than for example basic indicators with lower time frame. In case you use both i mean. But that's just me

[15-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
