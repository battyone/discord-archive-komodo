[telegram] <torsten1> You are entitled to your opinion and I respect that. If you think we shouldnt have done this, don't file a claim. Agama was badly tested, and we will inform the community re: the changes we will introduce in our process. (re @xarux: Would you prefer another thief to steal your money before it decided to make another thief? Yes - the first thief "after some time will return to you perhaps" - but even if it is for good, it is still theft, even for good! Ethereum in its time hardfok grasped on such incidents! and what will we get now? Is the network infrastructure safe? Ok, the blockchain itself is good - but its infrastructure is well-known! It means that agama was badly tested - competing in the speed of releases instead of focusing on the security of the wallet! You have a dissonance that such a cool project happened? Me too! This is my favorite project - but now the big questions!)

[telegram] <Ra> I think if your planning to steal millions youll probly have all the patience in the world (re @pungoio: will wait for official explanations at a later point but I don't get how malicious code waited several months accumulating mnemonic/wifs before moving funds valued in millions)

[05-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <LuckyBTC> I remember a guy in this chat was selling Komodo for half the price, He might be that thief?

[05-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <ionstar> Or send them through a "washer" which outputs to a lot of different addresses. (re @BearTheTrader: If I was the thief I would try to exchange them via OTC)

[05-Jun-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> I am now conducting a parallel dialogue with the developers on the discord. - nothing positive and specific - on-duty answers! The timing is not exactly known! Imagine when there are many thousands of tokens in your business and they have been withdrawn from you, even for good purposes - but you are insolvent today!

[05-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sayanseb> do you know if the kmd dev can access to the fund in other wallet than agama? (re @xarux: I understand the difference perfectly - not worse than you - I am the developer of multiple chain systems! I wanted to draw attention to the fact that before fixing ALL vulnerabilities, a purse focused on the inviolability of your funds was released - even by members of the developers! But that you apparently do not see the difference between a hacker and a developer - there is no such difference! There is only an open source code and a white paper where there is not a word that even in case of closing the vulnerability, my money can be moved by unauthorized people! And do not be cunning - you poimaet it yourself!)

[05-Jun-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ra> Kmd needs to make a new bullet proof wallet

[05-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <FtrSaroth> No, only on agama because vulnerability was in agama (re @sayanseb: do you know if the kmd dev can access to the fund in other wallet than agama?)

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> the uptrend is canceled - and after all so beautifully the Komodo in tandem with the dollar moved - great! Now we will again test the line of $ 0.5. Probably - at least it can be purchased on bottoms)

[05-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sayanseb> thanks God everyday lol (re @xarux: of God team)))))

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <xarux> The Komodo blockchen itself is flawless - the problem is in the raw wallet that the developers did to catch the crypto-start-up race and did not give priority to the security and vulnerability audit! (re @sayanseb: maybe komodo and agama need the help of callisto team for audit üëç  @yograterol)

[telegram] <xarux> and momentum was one of the best in the top 100! do you agree? Especially for a pair with a dollar, a stable uptrend - real money came in and capitalization imperceptibly but steadily grew for 6 months! Volumes increased - I bought on the bottoms - because I believed that this is the best and undervalued project after Bitcoin! And now look at how the price started to run down!

[telegram] <xarux> I!!!!!!!!!!!! wonder who conducted the tests agama and allowed the release of a leaky version with a vulnerability - to bring to the strictest responsibility! We believe in a chest of drawers but remove from the development team of deletants! It is better not to rush with releases but to release a super product than an unfinished wallet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
