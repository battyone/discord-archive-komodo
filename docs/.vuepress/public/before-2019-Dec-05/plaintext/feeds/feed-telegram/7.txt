[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Basically it's a change app.  Micro investing into crypto (re @emmanux: Never heard of this "Cred" partnership.)

[13-Jun-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> I don't think it's official. Because i can't find any reference to "Cred" in the announcements channel on Slack.

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Steves been working on it the past couple months . (re @emmanux: I don't think it's official. Because i can't find any reference to "Cred" in the announcements channel on Slack.)

[13-Jun-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Cool, looking forward to the official announcement.

[13-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <íš¨ë¯¼> But cred is crypto also?

[13-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kkekoa> Cred, a micro-investing platform for cryptocurrency:  https://www.getcred.io/
cred has my curiosity up due to the investor and partnerships it has (needs to be verified):  Science, Inc., Komodo, Neblio, CoinMarkets (re @íš¨ë¯¼: is Cred crypto?)

[13-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kkekoa> For it not being official, there are quite a few articles about Cred partnering with Komodo. (re @emmanux: I don't think it's official. Because i can't find any reference to "Cred" in the announcements channel on Slack.)

[13-Jun-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kkekoa> It doesn't look like Cred is offering a coin or token.  Their app is supposed to be out in July.

[telegram] <eMort667> So I accidentally used the short cut to set up native agama wallet and Idk how to get my wif or private keys? When I go to settings and hit wallet.dat then get keys, I see over 90 WIFs. Which one is for my wallet and why are there so many? Sorry if this is a stupid question Iâ€™m kind of new and want to figure this out before sending funds here

[13-Jun-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> they are all your wallet addresses. WIF key = private key. One rule to live by " your private keys your coin, not your private key not your coin". (re @eMort667: So I accidentally used the short cut to set up native agama wallet and Idk how to get my wif or private keys?

[telegram] <jamescheng25> You can use lite mode which should always be using only one address.

[13-Jun-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <eMort667> Thank you very much. That really explains a lot. Iâ€™ve got a few more questions if youâ€™ve got some time?? (re @jamescheng25: You can use lite mode which should always be using only one address.)

[13-Jun-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> yesterday i doubled my supply of kmd averaging down the price, hope the price will not slide much more or i will have to buy more

[13-Jun-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <eMort667> So how exactly do I make sure to not lose my funds? Just save a copy of my wallet.dat file?

[13-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> yes, save your wallet.dat periodically

[13-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <eMort667> So I take it the lite mode is easier to use but is it as secure?

[13-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> if don't want to, you can create a new address on lite mode , save the pass phrase

[13-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> is it not enough to have saved the seed?

[13-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> then send everything to that address, that way you only have to remember that pass phrase

[13-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> That's not a good advice.

[13-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> i used native and many times the lite mode so if i lose the mac where the wallet is on i lose all the funds even if i have the seed and the wif?

[13-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> My advice is: if you're newbie, and unless you know exactly what you're doing, ALWAYS USE LITE MODE.

[13-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <eMort667> Thanks, I think Iâ€™ll end up doing this just for simplicityâ€™s sake but what about security differences between lite and native mode (re @jamescheng25: then send everything to that address, that way you only have to remember that pass phrase)

[13-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> if you have the wif to all the addresses that have your fund, then you should be safe. But change address is always created everytime you have transaction on native mode. (re @BearTheTrader: i used native and many times the lite mode so if i lose the mac where the wallet is on i lose all the funds even if i have the seed and the wif?)

[13-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> not all of the, only some of them, because of change addresses. Yes, bitcoin protocol sucks monkey balls at that. (re @BearTheTrader: i used native and many times the lite mode so if i lose the mac where the wallet is on i lose all the funds even if i have the seed and the wif?)

[13-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Best advice ever: always use Lite mode, never use native mode. If you used native mode, login to native mode and send all of your funds to your lite mode address.

[13-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <jamescheng25> It is as secure as the security of your computer. The blockchain itself is extremely secure. (re @eMort667: Thanks, I think Iâ€™ll end up doing this just for simplicityâ€™s sake but what about security differences between lite and native mode)

[13-Jun-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> but humans are not secure... most people just forget about the change addresses.

[13-Jun-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmanux> Easier way: create a Lite Mode address. 
Keep that seed safe, 
send some coins to it, in order to verify the process, from Native, to Lite Mode address,
and send all of your coins to the Lite Mode address.
Never again use Native (it will re-create the problem). (re @BearTheTrader: how do i find the file?)
