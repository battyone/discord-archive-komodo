VRSC used KMD as a base and built a unique CPU only mining and its network is having thousands of nodes, hard to tell exactly how many and it could have close to the nodes BTC has.
using vanilla KMD params allows to create runtime forks and there is no code to write, anyway drunken complaining about bugs in code...
