KMD Bullish for BITTREX:KMDBTC by imBagsy

Falling wedge + clear bullish div on the 12H, I think we'll see a bounce here shortly, I'd look at R1, maybe R2 as potential targets/TP's.

I like KMD. I like its eco-system, and I like the token.

I've been waiting for KMD to retrace. 

The scale of the alt retrace has been stronger than many expected - but it offers up new opportunities.

I will keep watching for the Market Structure to hold for an entry, no po...

[telegram] <Spectrezenn> Hello,
May I ask how much($) the company invested in Komodo itself? 
And where is the company based at the momen? Thanks a lot!üôÇ

[06-May-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
$0

[06-May-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no company

[06-May-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not a corporate coin

[06-May-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is an open source project

[06-May-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Spectrezenn> ok thank you, and i was wondering how much money did the management team invest for starting Komodo?

[06-May-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a small ICO for about $2 mil, but most of that is reserved for paying BTC notarization txfees

[06-May-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Listings are less frequent, we're already on some of the biggest exchanges in the world (and Komodo never pays for listings) so there likely aren't listing bumps in price. Community members are definitely encouraged to reach out to their favorite exchanges to see if they will list KMD or Komodo asset chains, but Komodo won't pay for listings and many exchanges charge fees. Though KMD and Komodo asset chains have a far lower risk profile for exchanges as the asset chains and KMD are dPoW protected, which protects exchanges from 51% attacks. Basically when deposits get 2 confirmations it means the transaction was notarized and can't be reversed. (re @PersonalDep: really? well, are there any listings update that will be coming out sooner or later?)

[06-May-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Exchanges need to calculate the risk of adding altcoins, especially with low hash rates, because they could be the victims of 51% attacks. However dPoW helps reduce this risk so long as the exchange waits for at least 2 confirmations.

[telegram] <Komodo111> Any one had problems with chainzilla wallet back up phase

[06-May-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Do you mean Chameleon? Not on my end, what's the problem? (re @Komodo111: Any one had problems with chainzilla wallet back up phase)

[06-May-19 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you are restoring a wallet and typing the seed phrase in, make sure your keyboard isn't autocorrecting the first letter of the first word to a capital, this would change your entire seed and show a new address with empty balance and no transactions

[06-May-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Also be sure not to have any spaces before or after the seed if you are copy and pasting it in

[06-May-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Komodo111> Yeah sorry chameleon, I've log out of the mobile wallet, and when I've log back in with seed phase my kmd is no longer there. When I did  log out I did use the 3rd choice log out all data will be deleted from this device but I've have my phase keys and now when I'm loggin it showing transactions from 2018 Mar and Jan loads of the m, I don't no if this is what all wallet show but I've only downloaded the wallet 3 days ago (re @Regnar: Do you mean Chameleon? Not on my end, what's the problem?)

[06-May-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Ok make sure your keyboard isn't changing the seed as you input it, my Samsung keyboard likes to capitalize letters. Any capital or extra space will make the seed different. If you see the address is different or the transactions are different, it's likely the wrong seed. You can also test your seed in Agama to make sure you have it all correct (re @Komodo111: Yeah sorry chameleon, I've log out of the mobile wallet, and when I've log back in with seed phase my kmd is no longer there. When I did  log out I did use the 3rd choice log out all data will be deleted from this device but I've have my phase keys and now when I'm loggin it showing transactions from 2018 Mar and Jan loads of the m, I don't no if this is what all wallet show but I've only downloaded the wallet 3 days ago)

[06-May-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Are you typing or copy and pasting the seed in?

[06-May-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Komodo111> Typing

[06-May-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Okay and if the first letter of the first word is capitalized, go change it to lowercase and try that

[06-May-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Komodo111> All is lower case

[06-May-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Komodo111> Never seen an seed with capital

[06-May-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> They don't usually have capitals, it's just if you type them in keyboards try to change the first letter to capital for grammar reasons, which makes it a different seed.

[06-May-19 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> What wallet are you using? Chameleon allows you to import seed, and after that uses a password, not seed, to lock the app. (re @Komodo111: It a loss I no it, love komodo but it's not user friendly, in most other mobile apps in crypto if your phone off for 5 mins or so it logs you out. to loggin and to mess around with you pass phrase to get in and out is crazy that's what your pass words for init, just more words on the the screen to confuse but for people to have there own back to say I told you so, a loss is a loss it could of been more but hey, and just to say I've got seed phase which is right)

[06-May-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Also if your seed phrase is being inputted correctly it will work. Input seed, make sure there are no extra spaces, and no capital letters, and enter the wallet. Then press the + Add Coin button and add the coins you have balances with (KMD, BTC w.e)

[06-May-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If the addresses, balances, and transaction history aren't the ones associated with that seed, there was user error inputting the seed.

[06-May-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Restoring in Chameleon only needs to be done once (correctly) from that point on the app is unlocked with the password you set (not the seed)

[06-May-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Chameleon is very user friendly. Different seed, different address. A single type or capital letter, extra space etc in a seed changes the seed completely. This is universally true.

[06-May-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think you can enter the wallet without password but any transaction or adding coin within the app requires password

[06-May-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Komodo111> I'm new to dealing with crypto, so if I type my seed in right my balance should show up Right? Because my ate

[06-May-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yes. The seed is very picky. It must be EXACTLY the same as it was before. including case sensitive and looks at spaces
