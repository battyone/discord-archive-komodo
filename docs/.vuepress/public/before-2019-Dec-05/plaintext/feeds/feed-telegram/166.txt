[03-Nov-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> ........and for many other coins.

[03-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> Do we have to have some komodo default to transfer other assets. I want to transfer CHIPS  to the agama wallet.

[03-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Are you using Lite mode?

[03-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> As Acura said, you just need to activate Chips coin in Lite mode, it's the same address as KMD.

[03-Nov-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> I don't understand what lite mode is. I have never used a komodo wallet before. Can you clarify.  Thanks (re @yorklab: Are you using Lite mode?)

[03-Nov-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> How do you currently store Chips?

[03-Nov-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> download the Agama wallet, you may understand more by using it first. Follow the guides with the link I supplied above.

[03-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> It's on exchange. (re @yorklab: How do you currently store Chips?)

[03-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> So to transfer chips, I have to activate chips in LITE mode. (re @yorklab: As Acura said, you just need to activate Chips coin in Lite mode, it's the same address as KMD.)

[03-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Download wallet, follow guides. Create new KMD address. That same address is also used for Chips. Be sure to use "Lite" mode. Native downloads the entire blockchain.

[03-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> Okay. Thanks. So Chips is an asset chain on the Komodo blockchain. (re @yorklab: Download wallet, follow guides. Create new KMD address. That same address is also used for Chips. Be sure to use "Lite" mode. Native downloads the entire blockchain.)

[03-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes

[03-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> Thanks for the helpüòäüëç

[03-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> The first time you create the new wallet address, be sure to copy the address and your new key. Log out, then log back in and make sure it's the same address. If you mistype the key it will be a different address. Do this before any transfers.

[03-Nov-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> In fact do this a couple of times to be sure you have the correct address before transferring.

[03-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Kpprabhu> Okay. Thanks

[telegram] <polycryptoblog> You would have to change the wif format ,  but you could extrapolate one from another (re @Kpprabhu: The video says different private keys for different coins. Will chips and komodo have same private keys or different.)

[04-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No. That's just not how hardware wallets work. Hardware requires you to interact with it to use the private keys. Claiming rewards requires you sending your balance to yourself, which you can only do with the keys. Got to use the hardware once a month (after this is implemented) (re @Andreeees: If kmd is on ledger, will the rewards be claimed automatically?
