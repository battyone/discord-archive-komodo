[07-Mar-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kirikou> You are experiencing a trouble I mentioned on ledger reddit. Try to upgrade ledger live with the last version. To resume, ledger live doesn't set a nlocktime and so no reward can be claim. However it should be better now. (re @Memz01: )

[07-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <kirikou> And you don't have to send you any TX, the app in the link I gave you take care of everything. Try to perform the update and send all your fund on binance or agama. Then send it back to your ledger and the nlocktime will be ok

[07-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763

you dont' need to leave your wallet open for KMD reward. it's automatic as long as you have over 10 KMD in a wallet and locktime is set

[telegram] <kirikou> It does'nt matter. You can claim the reward every 3 days if you want. Just be dyre that the fees are lower than the reward (re @Louisbap: Now, what is the best time to claim again? 31/03 or in April?)
