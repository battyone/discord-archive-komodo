[telegram] <yorklab> Also by holding KD you get 5.1% rewards and,as we are starting to see lately, Airdrops from some of the new projects using Komodo.

[25-Oct-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Airdrops are not part of the normal process though, that's up to the new projects.

[25-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> This is a very relevant point. Although price isn't something I'm interested in. I'm more trying to find a coin that will be a force in the future in terms of adoption. Although I guess price automatically comes into affect with this (re @yorklab: The amount doesn't matter.  If coin X goes for $1 and coin B goes for $10; then later coint X goes for $1.5 but coin B goes for $20, then coin B was a better buy. Prices has no bearing.)

[25-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Exactly -you found the project; I think Komodo will be a force in the future.

[25-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> If I buy can you recommend the best mobile wallet to store KMD.... I've seen the AGAMA one in the playstore for Android?

[25-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Thanks for all your help today! Much appreciated! (re @yorklab: Exactly -you found the project; I think Komodo will be a force in the future.)

[25-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You can use the mobile wallet for Android but I don't recommend storing a large quantity there. I would download the Agama desktop to store most of your kmd.

[25-Oct-18 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> I don't have a desktop unfortunately (re @yorklab: You can use the mobile wallet for Android but I don't recommend storing a large quantity there. I would download the Agama desktop to store most of your kmd.)

[25-Oct-18 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tczbzb> I heard if we keep KMD in Wallet long time enough , there will be “dividends” - like pos, is it true ?

[25-Oct-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Much appreciated (re @Hermes08: Quick guide for mobile wallet https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000025621-a-guide-to-agama-mobile-android-)

[25-Oct-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> If you have more than 10 KMD, after one hour you start to accumulate rewards. (re @tczbzb: I heard if we keep KMD in Wallet long time enough , there will be “dividends” - like pos, is it true ?)

[25-Oct-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> The wallet does not have to be up and running to accumulate, though you do need to claim at least once a month.

[25-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Found a Guaruda wallet too??

[25-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Any good? Seems simpler

[25-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> To use and setup

[25-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Will KMD implement the lightning network once it's available?

[25-Oct-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> No, though I think the Chips asset chain may use it. Komodo is already pretty fast and has unlimited scalability, so don't believe LN will be a necessity.

[25-Oct-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> But there are others who may chime in that are more on top of that tech than myself.

[25-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <n2okpride> I believe that is still the case.

[25-Oct-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> I don't use the Guarda wallet, though last I heard they do support kmd and rewards. (re @BrokenBank: Found a Guaruda wallet too??)

[25-Oct-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Thanks. All setup with the mobile wallet. Now if one-day I get a desktop, can I use the seed from the mobile wallet and add it straight to the desktop, or should I start another account and then send it to that address from the mobile wallet?

[25-Oct-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Sorry for all the questions. Last one

[25-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> Yes, same seed, same address.

[25-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Brilliant (re @yorklab: Yes, same seed, same address.)

[25-Oct-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> You could create another account to be safe, but that's up to you.

[25-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BrokenBank> Yep great. Can you generate new addresses with each transaction with KMD?

[25-Oct-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <yorklab> In Lite mode you need a new seed for each new address. In Native mode (you have to download the blockchain) it creates a new address each time you claim rewards.

[25-Oct-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <WithConFi> Do KMD plan on increasing their staking rewards? Maybe with some incentives in participating in the ecosystem or network?

[25-Oct-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <WithConFi> Trying to decide with my budget which staking rewards i should go for. Dcr, xzc, kmd.

[25-Oct-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <WithConFi> Love the idea that you can start staking rewards with low as 10 kmd.

[25-Oct-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Youknowwhoz> Ok , but I can’t see the coins in the wallet 
Plus out of no where now my receiving address have changed!! (re @PTYX11: https://kmdexplorer.ru/tx/926e9cb0c19eddd9f9c3301bc1550cf5152496e396c273a16d1c7d63ba65e604)

[telegram] <Hermes08> and we will provide a possible solution for this matter.

[25-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> As long as you keep your seed safe and you don't compromise your computer or environment there shouldn't be any problem using the lite mode version of the wallet. (re @WithConFi: Also a little worried that kmd wallet holding my seed key could be compromised if i buy large amounts of kmd in the agama wallet.)

[26-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
