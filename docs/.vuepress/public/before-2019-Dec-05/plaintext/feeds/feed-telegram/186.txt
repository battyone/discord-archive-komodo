We're pitching an idea that will definitely help but there is obvious fear and misunderstandings of what dPoW is. It's best to be patient and answer questions as fully as possible so to clear up confusion and see if its something their community will support. There's definitely some unfounded assumptions being made but answering as fully as possible can help.

[telegram] <Zoe> hi guys, anyone knows how to check trading volume of BartDEX?

[04-Dec-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> One of the biggest selling points of dPoW is the ability for anyone to check that a transaction has been notarized. If it's notarized its beyond the reach of any block reorganization attempt, which means the main target of 51% attacks (exchanges) simply has to wait for the notary confirmation to know for sure the deposit will not be reversed. If you protect exchanges from 51% you destroy any economic incentive to attack a chain anyway.
