you do realize we are in a bear market that has made prices go down a lot over last year. KMD is now recovered the price to last June levels, while most of the cryptos (including ZEC) are still trying to get back to last november prices

[20-Mar-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
denominated in ETH it is even a stronger performance

[telegram] <reubster> Hey I got a quick question on komodo's scaling solution

[20-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> So I understand u can spawn tons of asset chains

[20-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> And each asset chain is independent of each other but also cross operable

[20-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> Meaning each chain can be aware of another chain

[20-Mar-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> Which also enables swaps and things like that

[20-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> So I can see how this allows almost limitless scaling

[20-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> But for a single chain, is it not still bound by the normal issues?

[20-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> I don't want a bunch of independent chains

[20-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> I just want one chain that scales very well

[20-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> Or are u proposing that a single chain is fragmented up into several independent chains

[20-Mar-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> Like let's say I have a bitcoin type of chain on Komodo and I find that crap my tx is too much to process in one chain, I then spawn another chain but how do I alter the supply?

[20-Mar-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <reubster> Or do I have to plan it before hand that I will fragment my coin into x amount of chains

[20-Mar-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Lennart> afaik it will work automatically. there is an automated burn protocol, always aware of the total supply. your multiple chains act just as one single chain.

[20-Mar-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It's all built to be fluid that you don't realize it's on different chains. The idea of putting everything on one chain has a lot of flaws, for example even if a single chain can scale transactions it also suffers from a massively growing blockchain size and needs increasingly faster bandwidth for all full nodes to stay current. You eventually have nodes running TB sized chains with GB/s speeds just to stay updated. Which leads to node centralization and smaller projects having to essentially load EVERYTHING from every other project just to run a node for themselves, they could end up just relying on these central nodes for validation. (re @reubster: I don't want a bunch of independent chains)

[20-Mar-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> It isn't a single chain fragmented up, its multiple chains joined together. They act as one including being fungible (constant supply) but if i remember right, if you wanted you could run a node for a single chain which you use for the bulk of your transactions that could communicate with other chains easily. So you dont have to run a node validating every chain, just the one you operate on most often. Each chain is then secured with dPoW (re @reubster: Or are u proposing that a single chain is fragmented up into several independent chains)

KMD price is recovered to last June prices

[20-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> That's not how value is derived, by any economic school of thought. First of all, you're confusing value with PRICE, in a ceteris paribus economic model an increase in supply with constant demand would lower price, but markets price in expected growth of supply, which is WHY predictable inflation of a currency is important, even Bitcoin supply is inflating. 
Secondly, bring your statement which you say isn't hard to understand, to its logical conclusion. IF value increases when Supply goes down, then any coin would be most VALUABLE as supply approaches zero. But value isn't derived this way, because a currency is considered valuable because of other attributes (fungibility, divisibility, store of value, MoE, network effect etc) a single coin (or really small amount of coins) isnt good at pretty much any of this (unless it is hugely divisible, then you are just changing the scale of the supply anyway) (re @David: if the supp increases the value goes down, if the supp goes down the value goes up. How hard it is to understand?)

[20-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> If you want to prove this theory, go make a Komodo asset chain with a supply of 1. And see how valuable it is.
