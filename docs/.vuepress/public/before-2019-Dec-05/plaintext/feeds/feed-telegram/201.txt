[02-Feb-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> No it is a big rebrand. There are of course going to be theme and color changes but it's also a significant shift in how Komodo positions itself in the market, who our target market is, what products and services we will offer them, solidifying how we offer them etc. It is NOT just a website redesign and color schemes, that could've been done in a few weeks. This is a much bigger change, that requires a lot of market research in not only the crypto market, but traditional markets too, the bridging of industries and how Komodo will play a part in that, how it will create and offer those products, and how those products will drive value for KMD. (re @Kiwi_crypt0: Cool so more a theme change then actual rebrand)

[telegram] <Crypto_duniya> which is most lite version to download?

[02-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> the desktop version has both lite or full mode, if you have a strong seed you can use that in lite mode and always access the same address

[02-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I would say it's drastic. The way Komodo has done things in the past was very fragmented. A lot of work has been done and creating really cool and innovative stuff, but it was difficult to make that stuff an offering for businesses, individuals etc. The rebrand is very much a way of combining our tech and capabilities into a much more streamlined, manageable, and effective way. There will be visual adjustments too in order to truly distinguish Komodo products and services from others. (re @Ole: No not that drastisk. But more then "just" new colors theme think of it like a iceberg and the tip is what we see. And what I underneath is all of the changes to apps dapps tec so it's coherent across the board)

[telegram] <Ole> Now that is a definition of what drastic means. In my book it's means switching the name or God forbid going to be a erc20 token. Now that would be drastic. My point was the rebrand is huge and not taken lightly. I was using a iseberg metaphor color scheme is obly what we see. And streamlining all of kmd product is not what you and I will notice that much but it's huge and vital for kmd. But not drastic. But the word could be lost in translation. Anyway so many good news lately is hard not to have a hard on for kmd (re @Regnar: I would say it's drastic. The way Komodo has done things in the past was very fragmented. A lot of work has been done and creating really cool and innovative stuff, but it was difficult to make that stuff an offering for businesses, individuals etc. The rebrand is very much a way of combining our tech and capabilities into a much more streamlined, manageable, and effective way.

[02-Feb-19 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Yea I think Komodo is a unique and catchy name. I wouldn't be surprised if they did away with "Platform" though and moved just to Komodo. This is all unofficial and just my opinion, but it seems Komodo isn't like other platforms, and to use the word platform makes us seem to be similar in structure and in limitations. That isn't true however, coins aren't built on top of Komodo like erc20 coins are to Eth. So I wouldn't be surprised to see platform removed from the name, plus shorter names are catchier ;)
