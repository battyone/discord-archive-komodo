[telegram] <sreinhardt> Sigh... with places like Bittrex banning trading for US based customers for more and more coins/tokens crypto users are really going to have to start getting comfortable with decentralized systems like barterdex. They've been slower to catch on with the typical user but that's going to have to change here pretty soon...

[15-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Jun-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <sreinhardt> It‚Äôs feeling more like that all the time. It‚Äôs good for kmd in the long term but bad for crypto in the short term. If Joe-Average really understood the importance of a dex then people would be rushing to them but instead they have flocked to the centralized exchanges. Those comfortable with crypto will move to a dex but it‚Äôll make it harder to on-ramp until things get easier and people have a better understanding of crypto I think. We‚Äôll see... just hate to see the clamping down... land of the free... right...
