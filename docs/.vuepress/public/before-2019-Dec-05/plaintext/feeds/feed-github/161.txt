[jl777/SuperNET] Pull request opened: #1113 Take coin\->active into account
Now, I think that the iguana calls stopcoin and startcoin works without creating curl errors into iguanaTV.

Before this change, if we call stopcoin on iguana then we stop chips daemon, these errors occurred in iguanaTV:

curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server CHIPS.(127.0.0.1:***** getbestblockhash), retries: 4

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #509: KMD\-USDC swap failed \(MakerPaymentSpendFailed\) \[funds stuck\]
@tonymorony Hi, thank you for report! Yes, seems like at the moment of transaction broadcast attempt gas price was 10 gwei so required ETH amount was 0.0015, but user address had less. As of now MM2 doesn't check the gas price upon order creation and swap start which should be added for sure.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #510: LTC\-KMD swap failed \(TakerPaymentRefundFailed\) \[funds stuck\]
@tonymorony Hi, thank you for report!
Seems like the app was interrupted for some time and then started again after few hours. Taker payment was already spent by this time. As MM2 version was too old it triggered the `TakerPaymentWaitForSpendFailed` event immediately (not searching for spend tx) and then attempted to refund the payment which wasn't possible as maker already spent it. The special API will be added for such case so users will be able to claim their funds locked by such swaps.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #504: DOGE\-KMD swap failed with MakerPaymentSpendFailed but TakerPaymentSpent success \[funds stuck\]
@tonymorony Hi, thanks for report!
The problem is MM2 makes single attempt to broadcast the tx and even if it fails due to transport error (like disconnected electrums) it doesn't retry. In some cases it can be solved automatically, but we will still need the API to unstuck the funds manually (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/406).

I think that this is an inevitability sometimes; otherwise, I would need to write strictly in a bottom-up fashion. This way, when someone comes along to write the DEX class, they know what what it's called and which methods need to be implemented.

The alternatives would be to either write the CEX and DEX first, or have half-empty implementations in the order manager functions.

[jl777/SuperNET] Pull request opened: #1114 Take coin\->active into account
As https://github.com/jl777/SuperNET/pull/1113 was done into blackjok3r branch, I think that I should perform the same change into beta_season3 branch. Warning: I didn't test this change on this branch.
