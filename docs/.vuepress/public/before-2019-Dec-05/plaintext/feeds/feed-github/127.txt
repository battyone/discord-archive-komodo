[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #424: MakerPaymentValidateFailed but Maker sent payment
Should work better now, MM2 will make 3 attempts in 30 seconds to get the tx data and abort swap only in case all 3 attempts failed.

[artemii235/SuperNET] Issue opened: #438 How to get rid of old prices after mm2 restart?
mm2 now saves prices set through `setprice` and if you disable a coin, the console output is full of such entries
```· 2019-06-23 12:15:37 +0000 [broadcast_my_maker_orders KMD DASH] ping request creation failed lp_ordermatch:697] Rel coin DASH is not found```
my personal oppinion is that this feature to memorize old prices, even after a restart of mm2, is not a good idea
Question: How can i get rid of such old prices?

i see, it works now, with

```
don't know what the benefit is, but ok, doesn't matter

[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #438: How to get rid of old prices after mm2 restart?
@cipig Hi, could you please clarify in more details why it's `not a good idea`? We got a conflicting requirements from you and GUI developers, I also find this pretty useful because you'll have your orders up after MM2 restart (but you need to enable the corresponding coins for this). We may add the special param to not do it, but if other users won't have any problems with such orders persistence I'd recommend you to stick with `temporary` solution, but not remove the entire `DB` directory a...

@cipig Hi, please check the docs update after you update the MM2, we're still actively developing so things might change pretty fast. It'll help you to understand what change was made and what's the benefit from it.
As you might see by new example from docs the new `protocol` and `disable_cert_verification` params were added after SSL support implementation for Electrums. So we need a way to tell MM2 to use the SSL protocol and it's convenient to keep all params in 1 object representing the ...

[artemii235/SuperNET] New comment on issue #438: How to get rid of old prices after mm2 restart?
The problem is that if you remove (don't enable) a coin the next time when you start mm2, you will get errors, because mm2 tries to broadcast prices for a coin that is not enabled. Restarting mm was a good option to get rid of all the old stuff from a previous run, which now isn't possible any more.
OK, i will remove `DB/ORDERS/MY` every time i start mm2.

I see another potential problem with `DB/ORDERS/MY`: mm2 generates a new file every time i call `setprice`... don't know what the limit is with the number of files in one directory on linux... after a short period of time (couple of minutes), i already have over 1000 files in this directory

`> don't know what the limit is with the number of files in one directory on linux...`

This depends on the filesystem, some have directories of unlimited size, though the performance of the large directories is known to deteriorate on ext2-4.

`>after a short period of time (couple of minutes), i already have over 1000 files in this directory`

Will it keep growing?
If yes, then this is certainly a problem.

We might have an opportunity to revisit our approach to storage soon.

If the error will resurface, maybe we could print a cURL example which can be simply copy-pasted to reproduce the problem. In my experience adding such samples into the error logs would often help to further triage the problem.

@tonymorony Hi, thanks for your report! The OMG `transferFrom` function doesn't conform to ERC20 standard: https://etherscan.io/address/0xd26114cd6ee289accf82350c8d8487fedb8a0c07#code, the function should return `bool` [according to standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#transferfrom).

It's a bug, previous orders for pair are being cancelled by default on `setprice` call, but are not removed from DB. I will push fix today.

Makes sense, if an order was placed then we'd want to know of it afterwards, even if the configuration makes it [temporarily] invalid. Thanks for your help explaining, Artem.

@artemii235 yes, by `disable` i meant not enabling a coin after restart
But it is not such a big problem, because it does not happen that often and removing the orders by deleting the `DB/ORDERS/MY` directory is a good workaround.

We still need seed IPs, also need to make sure current notaries do not update to this version, as they need to keep running for all 3rd party coins for a while.
