value of transferred tokens: $1.33
txfee: $0.37 (with 21 gwei)

in order to avoid such swaps, it would be nice if `setprice` would support `minvolume`, so people can't start such swaps
the only other solution to this is to set the margin to 50% and higher, or to remove all ERC20-orders from orderbook when gasprice > 5 gwei (currently > 20 gwei)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #473: add minvolume to setprice
@cipig Hi, thanks for your report!
Please ensure that you're setting `gas_station_url` on ETH/ERC20 `enable`: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#enable, MM2 uses ETH node RPC API to get gas price by default. It usually results into higher fees.

The `minvolume` is easy to implement from MM2 side, but we will also need to handle this in GUI apps.

The gasprice limitation is much harder and error prone:
1. 0.37$ is too much for 1$ trade but it will be ...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #472: show balances of all enabled coins
`get_enabled_coins` purpose is to display currently enabled tickers. Please note that `my_balance` always sends the request to coin RPC as of now. So imagine if you have 100+ coins and all balances are requested at same time, it might take long time and cause some other issues. We might cache the balance of coins for such cases, but cache invalidation will be not really feasible. I prefer to avoid caching such essential data as long as possible.

`approve` tx is created every time when `allowance` is lower than required. It will `approve` the entire balance of the token so it will be always sent for first swap of the coin and then might not happen for long time.
Thanks for swap statuses, checking.

You are right, i think it is better to "solve" this locally, without modification to mm2 code.

Swap was successfully finished on maker side, payment was spent so should be something different. Might be related to the most recent changes in `wait_for_taker_payment_spend`, I will recheck the taker side swap in native mode now and get back to you.

The error was caused by coinbase tx deserialization error. MM2 performs block scan when searching for tx spend. The coinbase tx failed to deserialize so MM2 kept retrying in endless loop, fixed now. Swap will be kickstarted and finished after you update your node, however I think that TUSD payment won't be unlocked to you. Etomic swap smart contract has a constraint that payment can be spent only when time lock is not expired yet: https://github.com/artemii235/etomic-swap/blob/master/contract...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #24: Long app startup on Android
@Kiruel It's not normal for user experience. IIRC I was told that GUI should parallelize the enable requests to speed up them. Is it happening in latest version? I'm going to perform a benchmark with same coins activated in parallel and check what time it will take. I will post results here.

[jl777/komodo] New comment on pull request #1622: createrawtransaction enchancement
@leto yep. it was based on beta, but as we should have following path of branches merge:
```
jl777 -> FSM -> dev -> beta -> master
```
i'm just guess that current FSM branch already had all commits that exists in beta. That's why i did PR in FSM from branch based on beta.

**p.s.** Btw, first real script that uses new `createrawtransaction` behaviour is here - https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/commit/addecc0db5c022360571c549391050168d604ca1 . This can be very useful for NN ops.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #26 Typo for "name" in the i10n file may save you searching for bug one day
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/blob/master/l10n.dart#L144


On that line, the "name" attribute is spelled incorrectly, i guess the IDE auto checks things, but just in case you wanted to catch this before it's a hair pulling moment down the track :)

`swapSucceful` should be `swapSuccessful` but any changes need correction where it's called.   If it ain't broke.....
