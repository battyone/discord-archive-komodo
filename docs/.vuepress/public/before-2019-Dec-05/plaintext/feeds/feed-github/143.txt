Seems like we have 2 issues here:
1. Android GUI doesn't capture `stderr` on `send logs`, but stack trace is printed to `stderr`.
1. At least on my phone MM2 doesn't print function names on backtraces. Investingating now.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #466: my\_balance and orderbook shows old address format for BCH
One more problem arised using BCH on AtomicDEX. I'm posting it here instead of opening another issue, I don't know if I'm acting correctly.
One user tried to withdrawal BCH fund from AtomicDEX to another BCH wallet. By default, atomicDEX uses a fix 1000 satoshis fees, but the tx was large (lots of inputs) so miner fee was finally ~0.7 sat/B.
The transaction is unconfirmed until Bitcoin.com mines it, is the only pool I know mining < 1sat/B txs.

AtomicDEX must be able to set a fee of 1 sat...

[jl777/SuperNET] Pull request opened: #1093 Add lukechilds node IPs
I've added the IPs for my AR and NA nodes, both the primary and secondary servers.

I've added the static IPs of the actual nodes, and also floating IPs that point to the static IPs. If I ever change IP address for any reason, the static IPs will fail but the floating IPs will still forward to the new nodes, so I'll still be able to improve connectivity to the network without people updating.

Let me know if this is ok.
