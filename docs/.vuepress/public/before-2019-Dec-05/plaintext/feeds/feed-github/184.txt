First noticed this in CLI, reproduced in mobile app. 
Steps to reproduce:
- create an order manually

I see, thanks. So this contracts don't follow the standard: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#transferfrom
I don't believe they will change their contract, so marking GNT as unsupported and closing the issue.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #103: \[OTH issues\] listing fee issue
Thanks @dudezmobi 

To sum it up.

Cost to a developer to list their cryptocurrency on the atomicDEX GUI = $6,500.00 USD

Funding paid to a developer to develop a real cryptocurrency without an ICO = $0 USD

Cost of setting up and maintaining an SPV electrumx server = Roughly $5-10 USD per month

Cost of setting up integration with atomicGUI with a cryptocurrency already operating on the underlying layer MM2 / jl777/COINS repo = Maybe a few hours if that of "work"

The price just ...

Japanese language is not added yet. I'm closing this issue since there is already one related to translations implementation: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/69
@ca333 fyi: there are multiple requests for Japanese language translaton ^^

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #102: Paste address on SEND field
Thank you for the report.
Pasting problems in some cases / to some fields is known issue at the moment (there are some glitches in Flutter framework as far as I know). It'll be fixed in future releases from our or framework side.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #101: Order persists in orderbook after withdrawing funds
Thank you for the issue.
However, it is not a directly GUI issue and it seems that it's better to resolve it on protocol side (if there is easy solution for sure). From other side it's possible to add handler to GUI if it's hard to implement in API. 
Moving this one to relevant repo for evaluation (sorry in advance if it's duplicate)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] Issue opened: #554 Order persists in orderbook after withdrawing funds
First noticed this in CLI, reproduced in mobile app. 
Steps to reproduce:
- create an order manually
- withdraw funds from wallet
- check orderbook. Order remains in book, though the funds required to complete the order are no longer in the wallet.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #554: Order persists in orderbook after withdrawing funds
Easy enough to add a "cancel order" via CLI (or GUI) when withdrawal amount exceeds order value, but would be nice to implement on protocol side to avoid zombie orders in the orderbook.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API] New comment on issue #555: Some orders receiving with corrupted price
@tonymorony Hi, thanks for the report!
Price is not corrupted here, it's decimal representation of corresponding rational number with maximum available precision, e.g. from the linked issue:
`"price_rat":[[1,[2431504384,46]],[1,[3600861933,17618]]]` - it's actually `200000000000/75672334682861`, that is ~ `0.002642973827068902744216955210886791832516153690411964494336800995627777720251367932848888234461954501`. So the number has infinite decimal representation, but as BigDecimal has limited...
