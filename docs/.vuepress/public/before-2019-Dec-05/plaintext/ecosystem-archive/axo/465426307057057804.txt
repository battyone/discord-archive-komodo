Introducing Mexico's  Feature Rich Crypto we call  AXO, running on the Komodo Ecosystem.  We will be announcing our dICO Pre-Sale on July 11, 2018.

[09-Jul-18 12:17 AM] axo777#1232
Over 50% of Mexico's population is unbanked because many Mexicans do not trust the banks.

[09-Jul-18 12:20 AM] axo777#1232
With AXO people can have their bank in their pocket.

[09-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Deleted User#0000

Yes, many real world applications

[09-Jul-18 06:40 PM] PTYX#6840
Do you have a website?

[09-Jul-18 11:33 PM] axo777#1232
Its supposed to be ready on Wednesday.  Our team is working frantically to meet that date.  We also have a gateway to Mexican pesos to follow on.

@axo777  ustedes estaran lanzando la crypto divisa basada en pesos mexicanos?

[11-Jul-18 03:43 AM] axo777#1232
@Hermes  yes in the early Phase I we will be exclusively Mexican pesos.  This all will be explained on our website when we get it ready.  Our core team members met today, in person,  and we decided that we need about 2 more weeks for the front end.  We are building a scalable backend on AWS that will facilitate future phases in other Latin countries.  We are solving a problem with the blockchain that is particularly severe in Mexico, but similar pediments exist in other countries as well.  We have to go country by country because our product is financial and needs to be sold in the local currency.

[11-Jul-18 04:48 AM] CHMEX#0686
Do you have a banking license in Mexico and or are you accredited by CNBV?

[11-Jul-18 05:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Cual es la legalidad de eso?

[11-Jul-18 05:15 AM] PTYX#6840
When you say you're solving a a severe problem in Mexico, what do you mean exactly? And how will blockchain solve it?

Nuestra licencia de transmisor de dinero est√° en proceso.  Una vez que el proceso est√© completo estaremos acreditados por la CNBV (Comisi√≥n Nacional Bancario y de Valores) as√≠ como el Banco de M√©xico.

Our money transmitter licence is in process.  When that process is complete we will be approved by the CNBV and the Bank of Mexico.

@PTYX 

Nuestro consejero legal viaj√≥ a la ciudad de M√©xico (estamos ubicados en Monterrey) la semana pasada para verse con las autoridades y revisar los requisitos y regulaciones y no hay complicaciones legales ya que cumplimos con todos los requisitos que pide la ley.  La estructura legal en M√©xico nos permite realizar lo que planteamos.

Our team lawyer just flew to Mexico City (we are based in Monterrey) last week to meet the competent authorities to review the current requirements and legal structure and there was no legal complication was found, because we meet all legal requirements.  The current legal structure in Mexico allows us to do what we are doing.

Nuestra plataforma se est√° viendo muy bien, pero un poco atrasado (Somos tortugas, lento pero seguro).  Basado en mejoras que se decidi√≥ implementar, nos tomar√° un poco m√°s de lo planeado para empezar la preventa (tal vez 2 semanas).  En relaci√≥n a todas las dem√°s preguntas, todas ser√°n respondidas en nuestra mejorada plataforma.

Our platform is developing nicely but a little bit behind our schedule (We are turtles, slow but sure).  Based on upgrades we decided to implement, it will take a little longer to start the presale (maybe 2 weeks).  As for all other pending questions, we will address each and everyone on our upgraded platform.

Our Mexican Legal entity has been in negotations with some Mexican Banks to open a Mexican Peso business account.  This will make our Mexican Peso Gateway possible.  It also is the stepping stone to our own AXO debit card that will exchange our stable 1:1 AXOMXN coin to Mexican pesos in ATM's world wide..  All of this is worth the wait.  Neverless we are anxious to get the show on the road.  More updates as we progress.

[30-Oct-18 08:14 PM] axo777#1232
Hello Everybody,

[30-Oct-18 08:15 PM] axo777#1232
Patience pays off.  Today we signed the papers for our Mexican Peso bank account

[30-Oct-18 08:16 PM] axo777#1232
Now we roll  up our sleeves and get to work on finishing the exchange coding and dICO prep.

[30-Oct-18 08:21 PM] axo777#1232
Soon there will be a Mexican Peso Gateway for AXO, KMD and all the other coins in the Agama wallet.

Axo777 what other type of services we can expect from AXO?

[01-Nov-18 05:45 AM] Hermes#6934
this is interesting

[01-Nov-18 05:45 AM] Hermes#6934
is it only in Mexico?

[02-Nov-18 07:09 PM] axo777#1232
@Hermes  We are building a centralized/decentralized exchange that has its own native currency -- AXO.  With our AXOCoin we can expand into many other markets in Mexico in the future.   Next year we will be getting our Mexican FINCEN license where we can issue our own debit card, among  other things.   Until Mexico liberalizes its foreign exchange regulations the exchange and its Peso Gateway has to operate exclusively within Mexico.  Today a Mexican resident can only have a bank account in Mexican Pesos.  That is why we set up AXOBIT SAPI DE CV as the Mexican legal entity to develop the cryptocurrency market in Mexico.   About half of Mexico's population lives without a bank account which makes for a very fertile market.  Also, those people do not trust banks very much.  There is a lot of interest in cryptocurrencies in Mexico, that is why we got about 8,000 followers on Facebook in just a couple of weeks.  AXOBIT SAPI will be able to expand into several Latin American markets with relative ease downstream.  However, since Mexico is a "silo" we have also set up AXO LLC, a legal entity in Wyoming to access the US Dollar market.  AXO LLC is currently developing a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) product to track things from origin  to kitchen in the food sector since it is a "low hanging fruit".  This will be done  with RFID and CC Smart Contract Oracle technology .  You may have heard about Walmarts experience where they were able to reduce the time it took them track where their avocados were in their supply chain from 6 days to just a few seconds.  This was done with IBM and HyperLedger Fabric which is a private distributed ledger integrated with a private blockchain that is very, very expensive.  AXO LLC is in negotiation with a NASDAQ company to provide location signals to our Oracle that will be orders of magnitude cheaper and better than the IBM product. HyperLedger recently added ETH with a wrapper to allow EC-20 contracts.

Supply chain managers will not use a public blockchain where their private data such as sources and prices are visible to the entire blockchain.  Our solution will be a wrapper that works with HyperLedger so we can have private channels that restrict who can see the information to just those parties that are entitled to see it.  Since ETH has limited scalability we will prevail.  Our NASDAQ partner is very impressed with the 30,000 tx per second capability we have now.üòÄ

@Audo   Our story is fully outlined above.  Unfortunately, the form is asking for things we do not have ready as yet.  Rather than submit a partial form we prefer to wait until we have "all of our ducks in a row" before we go public.  Thanks for your understanding.

[16-Nov-18 07:32 PM] axo777#1232
However, we do have one thing to mention.  After looking at Hyperledger Fabric we found that it is a partial clone of Etherium with all of the ETH drawbacks that we completely avoid here in the KMD ecosystem. Concurrently, we found Corda which provides private channels of communication where only those that have a need to know and are certified to know the private information in their own trading or financial group.  Others on the blockchain will be completely oblivious to the private information in other channels.  This capability opens the market to the commerce of the world.üòÄ

[16-Nov-18 08:04 PM] axo777#1232
Interestingly enough Corda does not have its own native currency.  It was designed to integrate with the currency of the developer's choice.  Naturally we choose our AXO to be the native currency together with the stable coins  we will issue for specific channels backed with 1:1 bank deposits  to transfer value from sellers to buyers.  Integration is supposed to be easy.  The documentation indicates that all we need to do is have the AXO notary and the Corda notary nodes mutually recognize the signatures of the other.  Not sure who can help us with this.  It might be something @jl777c wants to look at since the AXO notaries are also the Komodo notaries.  This will move to our front burner early next year.

[22-Dec-18 04:25 PM] axo777#1232
Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year from the AXO Team.

@bit_chipper at the moment pgsql database stores static data. dynamic data and things like GPS that need provenance are stored on a testnet oracle. It's a hybrid db/oracle system.
Things that are better off in a database, go in database. Things that need immutability and a record of updates over time are stored on oracle
