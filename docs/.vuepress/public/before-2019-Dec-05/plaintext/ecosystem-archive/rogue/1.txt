Hi üëã

[19-Feb-19 10:11 AM] CrisF#3405
```there are so many cases so more testers/testing needed```
Might be good to get some of the original players involved as testers?  They might be interested in promoting the revival of their game with modern tech. And possibly provided a base for the community?

**ROGUERS** 
Please update to latest version (jl777 and FSM are in sync). there are "hardforking" changes in gameplay interpretation and I will be enabling strict validation soon. When I do, if you are not running the latest, you will go on a fork

For multi-player:```be sure that you have latest daemon and update TUI
TUI have 3 new features: 
[6] Create new multiplayer game (you'll be asked for max players amount and buyin amount)
[7] Join (register) multiplayer game - it's scan chain for multiplayer game and asking for txid of game you want to join, then sending register
[8] Check my multiplayer games status / start - it's scanning for not finished multiplayer games you participating in, asking if you want to start any, if yes asking for game txid and starting rogue for this game
Then after you finish your rogue game it'll execute bailout if there is more than 1 player alive or highlander if you're last player alive
Amulet cases I'm not tracking yet```

sorry, noob question here: if I already have komodo (from running agama wallet), can I just start the chain? Or do I have to clone and compile from jl777's github?

[20-Feb-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to compile from latest source locally. daemon from Agama will not work

[20-Feb-19 03:47 PM] wookie#7663
ok. thanks.

[20-Feb-19 04:07 PM] wookie#7663
I got this error after running build.sh each time: 
configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO

[20-Feb-19 04:07 PM] wookie#7663
is this expected?

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
you are using macOS?

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] wookie#7663
yes

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
use `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] wookie#7663
oh, I only used -j4

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] wookie#7663
would that make a difference?

[20-Feb-19 04:10 PM] SHossain#0007
j4 is ok

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
i believe you used `./zcutil/build.sh -j4`

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to use `build-mac.sh`

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] wookie#7663
yes

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] wookie#7663
oh ok

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] wookie#7663
you mean ./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j4

[20-Feb-19 04:11 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[20-Feb-19 04:13 PM] SHossain#0007
```build.sh = Linux
build-mac.sh = macOS (OSX)
build-win.sh = Windows cross-compile```

[20-Feb-19 04:13 PM] wookie#7663
oops, yes, I see where I did not read the instructions...my bad

[20-Feb-19 04:40 PM] wookie#7663
not sure what I did wrong this time, but when I copy and paste the cmd to start the chain,
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon

 I get: 
-bash: ./komodod: No such file or directory

[20-Feb-19 04:43 PM] SHossain#0007
what were the last few lines after compile finished?

[20-Feb-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
doesn't look like compile was finished

[20-Feb-19 04:45 PM] wookie#7663
last 5 lines: 
ld: library not found for -lidn2

[20-Feb-19 04:50 PM] SHossain#0007
so, it ended up on error. means komodod bins weren't created

[20-Feb-19 04:52 PM] wookie#7663

:Komodo:  **Hello Everyone!** 
I would really like to sort out some branding for The Rogue project.  I feel like we should really lock in a well chosen title for the project. I ended up putting "Rogue Chain" on twitter to get some accounts started, but i'm not happy with it.  I have a list put together for possible names to choose from and am open to more. I think selecting one banner to fly under is one of the most important things we can all decide on as it brings brand recognition, sets us apart from the other projects and shows strength as a community. 
 
I would like pretty much anyone's opinion so please feel free to tell what you like/do not like and WHY. 

Outside of my personal ideas I have seen Roguelike and Roguelander used alongside my current "Rogue Chain" . 

SO here is the list along with some comments from me. 
1 *Roguelander*  - what JL777c has named the multpilayer  game play(aka highlander can only be one.)
2 *Roguelike*  - Is a genre and technically... this game we have is ACTUALLY Rogue ..... so Roguelike as a title doesn't sit well for me.  
3 *RogueCC* - This grew on me over time, it showcases Crypto Conditions as the base of technology, it is short, simple and clear. It even has a nice ring to it and has this subconscious implication of being fast (500CC etc)  
4 *Rogue by Komodo*
5 *Komodo Rogue*
6 *KMD Rogue*
7 *Roguechain*
8 *Rogue Chain* (I'm personally burnt on the chain crypto names)
9 *Rogue Reinvented*
10(A) *Rogue Legacy*  - I really dig this one.
11 (B)*Chain Rogue*
12(C) *Crypto Rogue* 
13(D) *Rogue+*
14(E) *Rogue++*
Any other ideas?
