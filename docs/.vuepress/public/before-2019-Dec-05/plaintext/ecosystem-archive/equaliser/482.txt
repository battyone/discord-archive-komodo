[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> WIth market conditions being the way they have been it has been as useful as pissing in the wind trying to do anything recently.

[15-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Light weight/high reps should do it

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here lets start looking for podcasts and vloggers that we can introduce to our project here. PLease put it all in #suggestionsüì´  and we can start getting this kicked off. We need all of your help to get this done. I will be focused primarily on building the first house so any ideas/suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  My time on social media will be heavily reduced as I wont have much time to talk when building and i doubt I will want to when the day is done.

[16-Oct-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ok

[16-Oct-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've added a couple suggestions to #suggestionsüì´

[16-Oct-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think the Equaliser meme competition would be good idea to get the brand out there.

[16-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> nvm no one is active anymore

[16-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> All crypto discord is quiet, the 2018 bear market been putting on the squeeze

[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> nite too dude, üòÉ

[16-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> using soak maybe runing fine

[16-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @MassimoStyle just wait until you're old enough to try and buy a house, not easy especially with costs of living rising, wages stagnating, competition of property hoarders with multiple properties reducing the housing stock among many other factors. Maybe then you will be here not just for the rains and advocate for affordable housing üëç ‚úå

[16-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Buying a house in Australia is so expensive...

[16-Oct-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't know how my kids well ever do it when they grow up

[16-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The global debt is so extreme, our future generations will be forever trying to pay it off with higher taxes unfortunately. The current monetary system is a fraud

[16-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> a ponzi

[16-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've had a gutfull of it

[16-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The so called government that didn't want a banking royal commission, the ones that don't want an anti corruption body setup when approx 85% of Aussies think we do. Our politicians that own large investment property portfolios collectively to the tune of aud$370million and utilising negative gearing themselves to reduce their tax burden. Meanwhile Aussies tune into "reality" tv and listen to garbage spewed from the project tv and mainstream programming have no clue what's going on.

[16-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I do @‚úåJellysmash‚úå

[16-Oct-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto lol

[16-Oct-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, that's right

[16-Oct-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[16-Oct-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think a big problem is people want to live close to their job, and most jobs are in the major cities, which means greater demand which pushes housing prices up in cities

[16-Oct-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't know how far Equaliser can penetrate into change in housing into major cities, but still the other 99% of the country to house

[16-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will create a commuting community with savings so great the drive won‚Äôt matter

[16-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Idk the financial stats of Aus but I imagine if we can introduce a housing system that saves > 40% over current market conditions, people will flock to it.

[16-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, true

[16-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The key to getting a client to compromise is to offer true benefits for doing so

[16-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Owning their own home is a big motivator

[16-Oct-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This leads to the ‚Äú if I could, would you?‚Äù Closing technique

[16-Oct-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And honestly our building system  is high end that way because it‚Äôs a specialty concrete product

[16-Oct-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In Sydney, people have had to move to regional locations for affordable living but to the detriment of family time. Train commutes can be a couple hours and forget about driving because of traffic jams. The rapid increase of population has rendered Sydney trains inefficient, crowded and constant failures. Communities with self sustainable living and food is the best option where bartering is a means of progression for what one wants above necessity

[16-Oct-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Personally I‚Äôm trying to stick to housing. That‚Äôs where our part lies.

[16-Oct-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> When you get into the other stuff, you open yourself up to liability

[16-Oct-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Self sustained communities would be a hard sell....most people are moving away from regional areas. People don't want to live in the middle of nowhere. A lot of regional areas have been shrinking.

[16-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There are many angles to play here but I‚Äôd rather stay focused on the current build and keep progressing from there

[16-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Agreed, need to have smaller achievable goals

[16-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And maybe one day there may be extra goals, or goals that have a larger scope.

[16-Oct-18 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah ambition is amazing to have but it can be costly when pursued
