[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good night  @SwimedDragon

[08-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Get some good zzzzzzzz

[dscrdeql] <BeethovenAndMozart> It's just absolutely unbelievable to me how many people are in this Discord and want EQLI to do well, yet not a single one will facilitate trading on Exrates market. Nor will anyone from here even attempt to simply talk in the chat there to prompt other traders to invest in EQLI. I seriously how anyone can expect the price to go anywhere. I put a crap load of $ in buy support on Exrates and every time I did, the price was dumped right back down. Seriously... this entire scenario boggles my mind. I've been in other investments/communities such as this and have never seen so little effort put into the promotion of "the price" of the asset. I debated on coming in here many times, I debated on dumping my 1.2 million EQLI a few times. My end solution came to this, come in here and hope saying something will turn things for the better for all of us. I understand if this post gets deleted.... just make sure the right people see it before it does please. Been raining at my house all day long... so I'm going share some HEAVY rain with the community.

[08-Sep-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I have my buy orders in, and actually bought some a few days ago at 19 sats.

[08-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm not sure if you are aware  @BeethovenAndMozart but a lot of guys have been buying OTC

[08-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> which has caused very low trade volume

[08-Sep-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Simply put, most buys are going through direct with the founders.

[08-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The founders decided to offer this, due to the excessive withdrawal fees Exrates are charging

[08-Sep-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> They wanted to give the chance for new buyers to get in and buy EQLI without getting ripped off when withdrawing

[08-Sep-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Personally I don't have a lot of btc to create a wall on the exchange.

[08-Sep-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> As much as I'd like to

[09-Sep-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Realistically though, when ever ppl have bought at a low price, there will be some profit talking when that price has doubled our tripled. That's what happens on all exchanges with all stocks as well as crypto..

[09-Sep-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I understand your frustration  @BeethovenAndMozart

[09-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I too would like to see more buy action on Exrates

[09-Sep-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think the best strategy is to put your buy orders in and of someone dumps them at least you can benefit from it.

[09-Sep-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Also I've noticed the sell orders above 21 sats  are very low in volume so the price will jump quickly once it gets past around that 20 Sat mark.

[09-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think the buying otc is hindering this slightly atm.

[09-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Why would we delete it for your speaking your mind?

[09-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it is relevant and abotu what we are doing?

[09-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> There are big things in the pipeline and those that didn't buy below 20sats will be kicking themselves

[09-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> exactly haha also as you know we know how you are feeling we feel it to, we are working on getting more places for you guys to trade on 😉

[09-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I agree with you, but I can not do all things. We are all working on this from a different angle to make sure it goes through regardless.

[09-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> This is a really exiting project and we are all lucky to be part of it, so early on.

[09-Sep-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> :EQLI:

[09-Sep-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you have any suggestions, feel free to dm any of us with them. I am currently building the formula for the blocks.

[09-Sep-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but i am always thinking of ways to make this project better.

[09-Sep-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> also everyone  OTC deals are now closed.

[09-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> hi

[09-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its been a little quiet @beastMode - but i think the founders are working on the product instead of trying to artificially prop up the price. i agree that its frustrating but this project is at its infancy and in order for others to get behind it and believe in it the founders have to show people what their vision is.

[09-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> initially telling people their vision and outlining in in the whitepaper was great...but now theyre working on proving their concept and i believe we have to give them the benefit of the doubt for a little longer.

[09-Sep-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> each time we ask questions and inquire the general time frame is within the next few months so i think we will see some strong progress by the end of the year. that is my beliefe and my opinion from what i can see and hear

[09-Sep-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i too have a ton of EQLI , more than what you stated, and believe in the project. but like so many of us we want short term results and 1000 sats today! but realisitically we need to give them more time to accomplish their vision.

[09-Sep-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats my opinion anyway. and i hope you will remain on board to see it thru

[09-Sep-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It feels good to help others

[09-Sep-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's a win win for all involved

[09-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> As I have previously stated a few times in the past, many crypto projects hype up and spend a lot on marketing but turn out to be coins claiming to be the next Bitcoin. We haven't hyped up because of a real world solution to a real world problem of housing affordability. We want to get this right and do it well.

[09-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, do it right

[09-Sep-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> From the very beginning

[09-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> We aren't about pump and dump

[09-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But real organic growth

[09-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 🔸Equaliser won't contribute to already inflated established property market prices and a fraction of profits are used for helping those in natural disasters and also subsidies for some that need assistance owning a home.

[09-Sep-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Some people are just not used to DYOR and think a coin is a coin just to trade. There are people that dont see the reason and the benefits of coins so lack of education will trip people up and particularly in the bear market in crypto, always important to see long term.

[09-Sep-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 🔸Equaliser provides access to a great store of value in real estate. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.

[09-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's a long term project

[09-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wont even say that its a long term project.

[09-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you want fast results you will see them soon enough.

[09-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Organic growth for quality project. The hype will be huge organically when the first build is on the ground 👌

[09-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once I finish up block recipe, then it will be time to mass produce blocks.

[09-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once we have a supply then houses go up. thats how this works in its simplest of terms.

[09-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> great. looking forward to seeing this progress. and especially since its a "physical" product, for getting some press about it

[09-Sep-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Organic growth baby!! 😃 Current market conditions is a weak hands economy at the moment so quite often people are set in their ways unfortunately. I always appreciate the compliments about founders being active as alot of projects, the founders are rarely online or at all.

[09-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Will the blocks be mass produced on site, or will you need to transport them?

[09-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anyone looking to buy some cheap EQLI this is the chance. i have my bids in!

[09-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thanks 👌 :tipsy:

[09-Sep-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Aircrete blocks can easily be produced on site. Also depending on build locations we can build offsite and transport

[09-Sep-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they'd be easy to transport because they're so light

[09-Sep-18 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> hey, nice level up @c2k

[09-Sep-18 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> well done

[09-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Looks like I just bought 400k+ more EQLI with the bids I had in. My support wasn’t enough haha

[09-Sep-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The equipment and materials are light to transport to build sight. When I was building brick houses, several loads of bricks on pallets on a truck with a forklift or built in Craine are needed. Logistically expensive so our logistics will save several thousand dollars.

[09-Sep-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I really do hope EQLI turns out the way I think it will, I am decently heavily invested in it now, around 2.4 M. Keep up the good work guys 👍🏻

[09-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> niiiiiice!

[09-Sep-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we can build the blocks on site to save further, depending on how far we need to ship

[09-Sep-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the equipment to build the blocks is small, I think from memory it's just the foaming agent and the foaming machine. so not much in the way of equipment is required.  just the framework for the blocks and a few bags of conrete to mix with the foaming agent.

[09-Sep-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 2nd ☕  slow to start this Sunday morning 😇
