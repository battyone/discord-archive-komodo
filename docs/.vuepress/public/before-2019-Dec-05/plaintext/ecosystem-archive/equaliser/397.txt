[02-Sep-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> coffee for all those just waking up on sunday morning

[02-Sep-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> looks like a bug in EXRATES

[02-Sep-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the last price is 0.0012 BTC per EQLI

[02-Sep-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> couldn't happen unless someone bought every sell order all the way up to that price

[02-Sep-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> which it didn't

[02-Sep-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so don't know how the price of 0.0012 btc was reached...

[02-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> weird right?

[02-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's back to 0.00000018 now

[02-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> must be a bug in the exrate software perhaps

[02-Sep-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> back to 'normal'
