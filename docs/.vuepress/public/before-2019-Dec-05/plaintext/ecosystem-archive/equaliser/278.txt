[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Looking bloody on CMC, damn market bear tearing shreds

[09-Aug-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> yeah

[09-Aug-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hi guys, this market is rough to say the least.

[09-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> I deleted the Blockfolio from my phone
Destroyed the link to CMC

[09-Aug-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I believe the market will be completely different by next year though.

[09-Aug-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> The ETF will be approved, all the institutional investors are getting their ducks in a row. Once approved the money will pour in and btc will ath again taking alts with it shortly after.

[09-Aug-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, Im long. Believe in blockchain tech completely

[09-Aug-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I'm too busy to trade on a regular basis. I can't watch charts all the time so I'm very long on my positions with a few that I'll dump if they recover more in a bull.

[09-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> hmmm

[09-Aug-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> hey guys 😃

[09-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> hey @CombatWombat-Mod

[09-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> 😃

[09-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> @!👽 Thorth 👽 Yeah we will get past this obstacle.. I think at the moment its people taking profits. At the start people were picking up eql single sats so some people on the site would be taking profits

[09-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> lol @CombatWombat-Mod   .... that's not the point... i'm just curious... where they get those eql 😃  i know eqli will 🆙   soon enough 😃

[09-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> really??????

[09-Aug-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> @!👽 Thorth 👽 Yeah I get you.. I am assuming these are the eql that the whale dumped early on... there was a fair bit dumped.

[09-Aug-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> Once the devs explain to us which wallets contain their funds we will get a better picture

[09-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Where did the whale gets his funds??

[09-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> the team beleives it was some one who bought in on the dICO

[09-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> doesn't make sense though

[09-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> but at least the dumps have been smaller which means they have run out or running out

[09-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That price was $0.5...why would anyone buy at 0.5and sell at 0.001?

[09-Aug-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah thats what doesn't make sense

[09-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> even with 500 percent bonus still doesn't make sense

[09-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> that amount are all EQL for sale 😃  not just 1 sell 😃

[09-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah i think now we are dealing with people taking profits.. people who got their low orders filled

[09-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> there was heaps dumped at single sats

[09-Aug-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> @!👽 Thorth 👽  Good thanks.

[09-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> lmao

[09-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I just woke up... 4 million is a nice number to see, actually, and the dumper(s) seem to be getting desperate. During the first week, it was closer to 9 million total on the exchange. The smart buyers caught it low, I'd guess a few are taking profit, but most of the coins (over half) are simply not for sale right now. I'll call that a good sign 😄

[09-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> that's one excited bird to get a coffee

[09-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> clearly the second cup.

[09-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> haha...

[09-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yes, that dumper created a incredible opportunity for us to buy at a cheap price

[09-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm glad he was there a week or so ago....now it's time for the price to rise

[09-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> come on EQLI

[09-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽 Thorth 👽> for u... hyperdex  work ? start ?

[09-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
