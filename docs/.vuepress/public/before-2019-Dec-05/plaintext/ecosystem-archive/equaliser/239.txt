[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here are any of you running Agama on a mac? If so, is it working correctly and in synch with the block explorer?

[30-Jul-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> same here

[30-Jul-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well, so far the issue is narrowing down. It appears to be Windows specific. But we don't know if anyone is running OSX 😛 Agama works under Ubuntu, so does komodod. Haven't tried Komodo Ocean yet.

[30-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
