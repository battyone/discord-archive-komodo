[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here OK here is the announcement, I apologize if it is vague but here it is. Our exchange listing was scheduled for the end of the month. As of today, we have been told it will be done in 24-48 hours!!!!!!! I will announce which exchange just as soon as they ok it on their end. We will also have a referral link if you dont have an account there already so that we can help recoup some of our funds spent. Thank you all for your support, it means alot to each and every one of us.
