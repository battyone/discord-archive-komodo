[09-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> short day for me so just an hour and a half left haha

[09-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I have been unable to make any swaps since sale end.

[09-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its a decentralised exchange, so you put the order in and wait

[09-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Yes but its frustrate when you must always keep open the system to keep order active.

[09-Jul-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> even with limit sell seems to close down

[09-Jul-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Seem not many people use this barterdex system yet

[09-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Can you imagine how many people that kicked themselves when they sold btc in 2009 thinking it would never catch on?

[09-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> can explain on Buyer side  there are 2 buy orders but they have no UTXO size or amount ?

[09-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What about blockbuster video that had the opportunity to buy netflix and declined

[09-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

1 - VIX is showing complacency in the stock markets which is often one of many tell tale signs of a market correction around the corner. "Be fearful when others are greedy" Also the average cycle of U.S recessions is due about now or I though in 2016.

[09-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> If they have no UTXO they cannot buy?

[09-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> as when selecting target price on buyer side with sell to match price never closes order or matches.

[09-Jul-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> to up the utxo, just transfer 1 unit to that address

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> tickle the utxo

[09-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Yes I see this make UTXO's with splitting in barterdex. But me as seller I see order on Buy side that I cannot fill?

[09-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> How can they make offer to buy with 0 UTXO size and 0 UTXO Sum?
