[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> when i was reading the article from jellysmash , icould understand where building puerto rico was a really good idea, lots of poorly built homes and no paper records as to who owns them and to top it of they seem to get really bad weather conditions that can destroy lives as well as homes,  then i got to the bit where it was talking about next maybe starting in uk, this at first got me thinking , i live in the uk and i dont know of many exremely poorly built homes and i couldnt think why starting in the uk would be a good idea, we dont get tornados or really extreme weather like other places in the world , but when i thought about it more i can see what your reasoning is, in my local area the avarage price of a house is between £90,000 - £500,000 , and to try and save up for just the deposit for a nice home for my family i would need somewhere between £5,000 - £10,000 + , this might not sound like a lot to some people but most people i know just carnt save that sort of cash when they are running a family household , so buying a decent house where i am in my life now is unrealistic, maybe when my kids are grown up and flew the coup , we will be able to save more money alot faster to buy our own house, but by then i will probably be in my late 40's early 50's and entering in to a 25 year mortgage  at that late a stage in life seems a bit silly, for me anyway,for now im currently renting from my local council and i can see this being my life for the rest of my time on this green and blue earth,

[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> ill have a wach now

[19-Sep-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> another reason we are targeting more developed areas early on is to perfect our process. The places we'll be addressing later don't necessarily have the high structural standards of the UK or the US, so we can work out the process of building them at low cost in high cost areas, and then build comparatively fantastic structures in other areas, using local materials, and have a vastly superior product at low cost. Starting off in those areas would create a temptation to cut corners. I doubt any of this crew would succumb to it, but we are human 😄 But primarily, if you learn to build cheap on cost and expensive on quality where it DOES cost a lot, you can more readily cut costs without cutting quality in other areas.

[19-Sep-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> All of our structures will be compliant or exceed the most stringent building standards we can find. We intend to be the best.

[19-Sep-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> i can see where your coming from now @Biomech-Founder , you and the comedian make some very good points

[19-Sep-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <K00l1> hi

[19-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Unfortunately, politicians can only continue to increase population, thats all they can do without letting economic cycles take their natural course. Property prices will continue to increase.

[19-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @K00l1 what do you think?

[19-Sep-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Buying other crypto is not traitorous, blockchain, and decentralisation is good. there are just different flavours. 👍 😉

[19-Sep-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i must be off for some overdue sleep. Back soon when the highrise construction next door starts the noise at 6am 😂

[dscrdeql] <Zach> They still sell cryptocurrencies other than EQLI?

[19-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> 😂

[19-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :tipsy: :EQLI:

[19-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> helllo all

[19-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> There seems to be a chat option on exrates right now, suddenly popped up for me @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[19-Sep-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I have seen it

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> tradingview charts as well

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> iv been waching videos on youtube about people making things with aircreete , its interesting stuff,

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I asked a little about withdraw fee and the ticker, but they say an official representive needs to contact them

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its an amazing material to build with.

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> looks it, light weight, but strong,

[19-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> very surprised that it has not been bigger here in the states, but steel and lumber are big industry so I kind of do understand.

[19-Sep-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> im still not sure what the foam stuff they use is, all iv got so far is its soapy foam

[19-Sep-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> thats all it is.

[19-Sep-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the foam creates cellulation that create small air pockets in the concrete, allowing it to trap cold and heat, acting as an amazing insulator.

[19-Sep-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> so , the vids iv seen one fella was making things in his back garden, he was making shed/garage panels ,he was using metal frames and filling them with his aircreete mix he made himself,he seemed to have been making lots more things other than sheds .

[19-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> another vifd i seen was in a tropical climate and they was making a dome type building sort of like an igloo but with aircreete blocks instead of ice or snow blocks

[19-Sep-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> he made a large and thick slab of aircreete in a wooden form frame, after its set propperly he just cuts it in to smaller more manageble blocks for building houses, nice and easy to cut he said and weighs very little, its cool stuff

[19-Sep-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> then he coverd the whole dome with some type of roofing cloth, and then plasterd some other product like liquid aircreete over the top of the cloth on the dome and this sort of makes the whole house one solid building,

[19-Sep-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> no metal spikes/pegs holding it down incase of extreeme weather,

[19-Sep-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> nice one tipsy ,

[19-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Rockbot4> @AndronicusBass Steve Hughes is always great. This project and the team are probably one the most sincere and we wish the team great success

[19-Sep-18 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> im looking for more vids, hopefully i can find some to show how strong the buildings are in real storm situations,

[19-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> just checking before i do but is it ok for me to maybe post 1 or 2 vids every now and then from you tube about these  aircreete building projects, only if they are good vids , no boring stuff.

[19-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I can’t see why that would be a problem, just don’t spam us with videos hah

[19-Sep-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> cool, i wont  spam!

[19-Sep-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> promise 👍

[19-Sep-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Aircrete really is a cool substance though, I agree with you

[19-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> our market cap is already 2 mil euros I just noticed that in coingecko 😄

[19-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I only use coingecko because of eqli tbh ahah

[19-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would cryptopia be good to list EQLI on?

[19-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i really think between the dumper being done and most of the remaining supply being tightly held that people are going to have to start paying up to buy some. happened yesterday.
its just a matter of getting more peoople to find out about this project because its so unknown!

[19-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yes def , when I talked with my friends last saturday I told them exactly that and each one of them as eqli enough to run a masternode which if they wanted now they would have to pay 3x the price they paid last week.
