[30-Oct-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[30-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hi  @Jonathan

[30-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> What country are you in  @Jonathan

[30-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Hey @✌Jellysmash✌ - I'm in the US (Virginia)

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That's right

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I forgot

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> 😃

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's your autumn now

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Yep - getting chilly out

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's warmer here now

[30-Oct-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> My favorite season though

[30-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's meant to be 35celcius here on the weekend

[30-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Autumn leaves are nice

[30-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Had aspecial feel about it..autumn

[30-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Are you mining crypto?

[30-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> A lot of miners find the colder weather a godsend

[30-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm not mining

[30-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Power too expensive

[30-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Don't have the equipment to be productive - eventually though

[30-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> How much does it spike it?

[30-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> My power bill was an extra $250 for one quarter

[30-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I probably got $20 worth of coin mined

[30-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Not worth it

[30-Oct-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Damn, that's crazy

[30-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Looks like Friday I will be able to pour the first block for testing.

[30-Oct-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I spent a few days working for my friend pouring concrete to get my back used to it again.

[30-Oct-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've got things ready to roll on this end just gotta get the ok from the county and the engineer.

[30-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So as soon as the blocks are approved, I am mass producing them and getting this ready to go.

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hi there guys

[31-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Great progress  @CowboyCrypto

[31-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm super busy at work now on a new project. Already slapped on the wrist a couple of times for overstepping my "authority" of which I seem to have none.

[31-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lol.

[31-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Corporate madness...

[31-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That's why ppl like Dilbert cartoons so much

[31-Oct-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[31-Oct-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Unfortunately corporate usually dont like free thinking people with good ideas that can benefit the organisation. I have experienced this in many places

[31-Oct-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I have been mentioning eqli in the channels. Any newbs show up lately?

[31-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I haven’t noticed buddy

[31-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just keep at it though!

[31-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice one  @NWhiskeyTango

[31-Oct-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, keep it up, always good to get the Equaliser brand out there

[31-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ya i am not here much but eqli is still on my radar. Just loads going on atm

[31-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice one

[31-Oct-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think the whole bear market has killed a lot of interest and enthusiasm for crypto projects

[31-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Crypto interest has dwindled in the last several months. Global markets are looking dicey and only a matter of time before everyone piles into crypto again

[31-Oct-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> bit more 'tangy' then regular gravy style

[31-Oct-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
