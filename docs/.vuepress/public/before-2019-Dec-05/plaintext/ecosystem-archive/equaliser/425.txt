[13-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I forgot to seal the sides lol

[13-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not an issue though

[13-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s a test block so as long as I can test it I’m a few weeks I’ll be happy

[13-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> thanks for the update picture @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[13-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they said 2-4 weeks on it

[13-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so it will take a bit.

[13-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am ordering 1 for now just as they are crazy expensive

[13-Sep-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm up super early from a weird bird noises from across the road. Havent heard that kind of cackle before, every 20-30 seconds haha

[13-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> birds around here are starting earlier and earlier as it's getting lighter in the morning

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> my place backs onto the bush so there are birds everywhere

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Wish I had a BB gun lol

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> which is good

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> but noisy

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> JK

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the cockatoos are the loudest

[13-Sep-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> kookaburras as well

[13-Sep-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I love waking up early. Can't remember the last time I heard a kookaburra

[13-Sep-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When camping at the river in the past, the Galahs are loud af, big screeches

[13-Sep-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> this is going to be awesome

[13-Sep-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wish you guy's had a prototype . As much as the hurricane coming is bad, it would have been a perfect test to see how it acts in hurricane weather

[13-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its hurricane season now I believe

[13-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've never been in a hurricane before. I don't even think we have those here in Europe. At least not where I live

[13-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> When I see it on the news I can't imagine how it is to leave your home behind to go to a safe place. Your home should be the place where you can be safe, alway's.

[13-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I couldnt fathom the idea of being in one.

[13-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I will have to get used to the idea when I'm building in areas that are susceptible to them.

[13-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i htink it'd be one of those things that you wonder how amazing it would be to be there and see it....but when it happens you'd be scared af

[13-Sep-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I'll be on the edge of one in a few days, it got knocked down to category 2 though

[13-Sep-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the concrete gains strength over time, but we would be strapping it in with hurricane straps to secure it to a foundation, ,making it much more stable.

[13-Sep-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Domes are amazing for high winds as the wind just goes around them.

[13-Sep-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> good night

[13-Sep-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> pity have to wear a motorcycle helmet, I know it's a safety thing, so gotta do it

[13-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i think in other countries it's not mandatory, but probably should be

[13-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> still be nice to be able to ride without it on small trips occassionally

[13-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Vinsmoke🌹🍤> Thats huge. Level 16 😱

[14-Sep-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice. I've been observing global markets and economics for the past half decade, there are excessive bubbles everywhere and the fact that BTC had a healthy correction only set's it up for the bull run of all bull runs when people exit other markets before they crash from debt.
