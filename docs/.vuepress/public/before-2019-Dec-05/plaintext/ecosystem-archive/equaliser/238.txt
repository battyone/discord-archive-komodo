[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> just be patient ppl.

[30-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I know, I helped you install it üòÑ

[30-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> these things happen and we   will get through this.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exrates is in the process of updating as well

[30-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ill wait till tomorrow and try again.. the thing im concerned about is my withdrawal from exrates which I received isn't showing up on the block chain

[30-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, we'll nail this. Everybody hang tight.

[30-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> im still scratching my head about that

[30-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> yes I think they are doing bad things at this exchange

[30-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no worries wombat, either way you will be just fine

[30-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @CombatWombat, do you have a transaction ID?

[30-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> what about me? I miss coins too now

[30-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @Biomech-Founder  please let me know if there has to be done something with komodo ocean. I might not be around for some hours üòÉ Thank you

[30-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @MagicByt3 same deal. Do you have a transaction ID? DM 'em to me if you do, I'll see what I can find.

[30-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder yeah i posted it in support ... it came into my wallet before all this happened.. confirmed but after what ever happened its not showing up

[30-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I do @Biomech-Founder   exrates confs are still 3 i wait see if arrives and balance is correct if issue i DM you.

[30-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will show up once the sync is complete then

[30-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no worries

[30-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ok, I'll check it out. We'll follow up with exrates if they have gotten off chain, but I think they're ok. We'll know shortly.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here we're getting the issues resolved, and will keep you regularly updated. I'm primarily in charge of maintaining the chain, and I should have announced the problem earlier than I did. No malice on my part, I was busy trying to fix it and failed to think about the social aspect. Won't happen again. Hopefully, no chain issues will happen again, but of course we can't guarantee that.

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you compile komodod from source and start with just wallet.dat and EQL.conf, it will sync up correct. With Agama and Komodo Ocean, this doesn't seem to work. We're in talks with Chainmakers, we'll get this sorted.
