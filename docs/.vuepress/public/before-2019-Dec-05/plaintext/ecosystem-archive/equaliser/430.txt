[15-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Guys do we have any plans or have we contacted CMC to be listed there or are we waiting to be ranked higher in order to get more visibility??

[15-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> just wondering

[15-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> More visibility

[15-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I see

[15-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> makes totally sense.

[15-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> even if we get listed in CMC we would be ranked in the 1000's what goood would that do for us

[15-Sep-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> since nobody would care anyway

[15-Sep-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, if we get other news, new exchanges or the first build, it will probably go up a lot. Plus there's not that much sell orders. And we still don't have many people in here. It probably takes time but I must say it's looking good so far

[15-Sep-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye I know the price that we see today is a steal thats for sure

[15-Sep-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> even when I bought yesterday I felt that seeing what price we used to have in the ICO

[15-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> 😄

[15-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> @✌Jellysmash✌ yeah i hope so my brotherhood

[15-Sep-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And it's funny, it's even been under 1 sat I think

[15-Sep-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Really

[15-Sep-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> never saw that low

[15-Sep-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> the lowest I saw was 10 sats or so

[15-Sep-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I did bought some at 4 sats I think

[15-Sep-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure at what prices I did buy on exrates

[15-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I wished and thinking when I bought yesterday was an amazing deal

[15-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 😄

[15-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> bought at 15 sats or so
