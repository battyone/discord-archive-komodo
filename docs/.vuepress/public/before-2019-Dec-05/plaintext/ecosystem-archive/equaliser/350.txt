[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> It means there are more secret rooms lol

[20-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The more active and leveling up, opens up more rooms.

[20-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> 😄

[dscrdeql] <adriana> you guys overreacted about that

[20-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> there's probably about a hundred rooms here that I've never even seen

[20-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> or even dreamt of

[20-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Sounds good

[20-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> no point deleting my msg

[20-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> kinda rude

[20-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> when i was referencing our role

[20-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm rarely in #off-topic

[20-Aug-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> We have notice that

[20-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Its been a while since we last saw your 777 magic numbers

[20-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> 😄

[20-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lots of the new people are in #off-topic

[20-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Probably because the rains happen there

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I'm really struggling with their support right now, can't do a BTC/EQL trade

[20-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Can you trade it at other pairs?

[20-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Apparently they were planning to implement some updates and to withdrawl system, not sure where they're at with it but I wonder if something like that is going on right now.

[20-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> 👋🏻

[20-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> yeah their support said they'd have a fix in 24 hour 36 hours ago, I know they know what the problem is and I gave them very low level details on how to reproduce the issue.....It's ok I'm sure they're working on it

[20-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> How is everyone

[20-Aug-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> I ready for a beer

[20-Aug-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Great, about to crash for a few hours - how are you? @🚀📈edsky📉🤯

[20-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Are you still awake lol definitely part owl 🦉

[20-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> It must be daybreak now lol

[20-Aug-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Yep 👍

[20-Aug-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Left new york when i was 9

[20-Aug-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Nice

[20-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Jonathan-Mod  i think exrates have changed  their support people

[20-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 2 weeks ago it was really good and the people there coudl comprehend english well.

[20-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> On Friday last week when I tried to 'talk' to support there it was virtually useless

[20-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the person either didn't know basic english or was too dumbwitted to comprehend the most simple thing

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I just gave up in frustration

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> that doesn't sound good

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> after wasting an hour of my time

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> was hoping they would improve not get worse

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think they must have started off with a good crew and maybe swapped them out with retards

[20-Aug-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> or maybe I just happen to get the dud that day
