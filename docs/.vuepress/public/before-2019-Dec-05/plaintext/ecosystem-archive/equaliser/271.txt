[03-Aug-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> just a tip

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> to get the prices up

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> put buy order higher

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think at the current price is underpriced so much

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> ppl cant dump if no one will buy lol

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> it is

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> lmao

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> so grab it while it lasts

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I want to buy more, and want to make the absolute most of this opportunity to buy cheap

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> you could prob gut a house atm for a few thousand USD

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> just dont have all the funds I'd like

[03-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I'll do the best I can

[03-Aug-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Just trying to accumulate as much as possible

[03-Aug-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think Equaliser is a fantastic project

[03-Aug-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> looking forward to seeing it grow over time

[03-Aug-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's going to be awesome

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> hell yeah i cant wait xD

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> just need the price to start going up

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> we all can't wait

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> and we in and

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> building homes

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> xDDD

[03-Aug-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yes, I was wondering how the houses would be built wiht the price of EQL so low.

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> kinda need the price to go up a fair bit in order for it to be the basis of building a house of value

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> indeed

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but it will happen

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> or we have to say 1 trillion EQL per house

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> lmao

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> ðŸ˜„

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if prospective house buyers know of the new Equaliser scheme then they may start buying now in preparation and whilst the price is cheap

[03-Aug-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I would if I was thinking of building a house

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> yeah

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> at the phase we are in we need to bring awareness of what we are doing

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> in Puerto Rico

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> and the community is key to that

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> there is only soo much we can put into marketing

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gm all

[03-Aug-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> however word of mouth is the best

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> The project building companies in Australia build display homes so ppl can get an idea of the quality and designs of the houses they could buy

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> mornite c2k

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> the first home we intend to build is a proof of concept

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> to show people

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if you build a couple of display homes and have them open as a type of head office then ppl can come and see for themselves what they're like

[03-Aug-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> sounds good

[03-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> well if any of you guys a crypto PR gurus message me xDDD

[03-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> haha...no not a PR person...just talk a lot

[03-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think in this day and age social media is king

[03-Aug-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> if you can conquer the social media then you will get the aweness out there

[03-Aug-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> things like competitions also helps

[03-Aug-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think the whole rain thing is good to get people hooked a bit, then they'll want more and start buying

[03-Aug-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's what got me in and then I saw the community and the project and what it meant and stood for and i though that this is something thats great and i want to be part of

[03-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think the way you do the levels is smart

[03-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> once again it gets people wanting to move up and ahead

[03-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> gets them in that mindset

[03-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> smart thinking

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> If I was going to develop a discord channel I'd do all that

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> you guys are doing well

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> there are so many shitcoins out there

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> to stand out from them you need to be different and stand for something different and meaningful

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> .....like you're doing

[03-Aug-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> keep it up

[03-Aug-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> get the concept out there like jelly said

[03-Aug-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> in nyc years ago someone had a concept home near or on the property of a museum ( i think it was the met but cant remember)

[03-Aug-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anyway, so many tourists and visitors who came to the museum also saw the concept home

[03-Aug-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> not sure if they had to pay to show the home or if it was revolutionary and artistic enough that the museum just showed it but maybe thats a thoughts also.

[03-Aug-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just thinking out loud

[03-Aug-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Aug-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> cheers my dude we think on a similar wavelength there is a lot more coming to the discord soon which the team is working on ðŸ˜‰

[03-Aug-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> I do not speak English very well.
But I'll try

1. A fantastic project with great potential.
2. Do a weekly review
Done...
In the plans...
To-do sheet.

And release it every week. So that everyone will see the success of the project.

Twitter and Facebook are rubbish, with bounty hunters. For a penny, they will promote your project. But this is not the main thing.

Â  - The main thing is the articles in serious publications. - - Analytical materials.
StÐµÐµmit, Medium.

And methodically do their work.
As soon as there is the first house - you do not learn them price EQLI ðŸ˜ƒ
