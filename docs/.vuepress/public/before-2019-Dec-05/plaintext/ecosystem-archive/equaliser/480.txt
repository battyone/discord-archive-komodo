[14-Oct-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> just because of our name ticker

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Even renting in australia is expensive on minimum wage. I wonder if we should explore the option of affordable rent as I too am a renter and notice rent prices up in my state. What do we think? https://youtu.be/F0jUVW5q6ZU

[14-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 😂

[14-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @c2k i was searching something for camping tent

[14-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> something small and powerbank usage

[14-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i hear you. just kidding

[14-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont camp so cant help you with a heater. sorry

[14-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> i should carry my miner to camp

[14-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :EQLI:

[14-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> how do you camp Javadtth

[14-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> in a camper or in a tent?

[14-Oct-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> tent

[14-Oct-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> It'd  be cheaper to just buy those hot hand pouches for when your fire dies

[14-Oct-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ok,  if you have an old pot or something then what you should do is put that in your tent then put a few large rocks in the fire.

[14-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> then put those rocks in the pot before you want to go to sleep.

[14-Oct-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they'll put off heat for hours.

[14-Oct-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> @CowboyCrypto- Founder smoke can kill me

[14-Oct-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> im looking for  some thing that can work with powerbank

[14-Oct-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh then just get a small heater like you put on there

[14-Oct-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but that rock trick works well..

[14-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I was in scouts as a kid.

[14-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus I spend half my time in the woods

[14-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> tent is bit diffrent

[14-Oct-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> because there is no way for air

[14-Oct-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> those tents breathe.

[14-Oct-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no worries man get a  heater, sounds much easier

[14-Oct-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> yeah , searching for a heater
