[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'd actually like it to drop tremendously, because that would show a confidence in the dollar an Euro that is misplaced and I don't share. I'd be buying it by the wheelbarrow load, cuz every time the dollar gets hyped up, it crashes... and that's always good for BTC and Gold.

[11-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I think it would be bad for the market dipping below but thats just my opinion

[11-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I totally accepted the fact a long time ago that i will miss about 98% of the contests out there on the "must be present to win" factor. I am ok with it lol

[11-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And if you do, tell me how you done it. I need to learn, dammit.

[11-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Hi @Catalyst

[11-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> morning to you...

[11-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> I agree with that idea of what tango is proposing

[11-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> although it's probably your nighttime there

[11-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> but watch out for the good guys :p

[11-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yo Jelly man man

[11-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I won't qualifiy for the twitter bounty because I don't have 100 followers but I'm still going to do all I can and retweet adn liek and all the rest of it....

[11-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so guys even though you don't have 100 followers please if you can do it anyway then we can really givce good publicity for Equaliser

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> thing is I'd do it anyway whether I get the bounty or not...prefer to get it but if I don't then I'm still sending it

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> It's no big deal to do a few clicks anyway

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And further, let us know. If you don't qualify for the bounty, but you're helping us out, we'll do something to recognize.

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and Equaliser is for a great cause to help others

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We don't have a plan for that, but you do have my word on it.

[11-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> ok, thanks

[11-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I think the bounty program is good...really need to push the social media aspect for Equaliser to gain traction

[11-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> as well as getting listed on Coin Market Cap

[11-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'll see if I can write another Medium article as well....always good to push the articles

[11-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> as people give more credibility if they read it from others rather than just a whitepaper

[11-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> well am on the same boat as Jelly not many followers either but as he said will do what ever i deem fit for the betterment of EQLI in my own capacity.

[11-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> If people can say why they like Equaliser and why it's good in their own words then that makes a big difference in convincing people that Equaliser is great and to follow it

[11-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Iâ€™m doing the same everyday

[11-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> I have an account facebook - 5000 friends
Twitter - 3000.

I do not want to write on the forum.
Ready to retweet and publish new information on facebook

[11-Aug-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> wow...awesome @ghost

[11-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> you have a big following

[11-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @Biomech-Founder  it would be good to finalise the whole masternode thing now before this bounty starts so that people can send those details out about it

[11-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> things like how it'll work and how many coins required, etc

[11-Aug-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> there seems to be a big push the last 6 months on coins that have masternodes
