[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> The plan is to still be listed on a new exchange

[11-Oct-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I would say its "safe" but know that with everything there is a risk

[11-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'd trade on there again if I wanted to buy some, I'd just withdraw afterwards that's all

[11-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye I rather go via OTC still

[11-Oct-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> for now.

[11-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Equaliser is too important to let that issue affect it....don't let it.

[11-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> since the lowest sell order its 21 sats might aswell buy via OTC and get the 20 sats rate and its quicker.

[11-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> OTC is good

[11-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Plus founders are going to use funds they get from OTC to help list on other exchanges

[11-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yes I know

[11-Oct-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> guys where did the trivia channel go

[11-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not sure

[11-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe founders moved out

[11-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I deleted it to get rid of clutter

[12-Oct-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Update on our progress: we redesigned the foam machine to handle multiple barrels of mixing continuously without need for refill, waiting on materials to start pouring what we hope are our final blocks to send to engineer for testing

[12-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Killin it!! Nice work @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[12-Oct-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> New foam generator is f‚Äôn awesome

[12-Oct-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Puts out amazingly thick foam. Now I wait for some stuff to come in and we get two blocks tested

[12-Oct-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Wow, great work  @CowboyCrypto

[12-Oct-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice to hear that progress

[12-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto just wondering if it's worth shaping the blocks so that they can slot in prefab door frames and window frames for quicker assembly of house.

[dscrdeql] <GlorymanRTS> my friend told me that people got free coin, just for chatting on this discord

[12-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Many other discords do it too

[12-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> just to name a couple

[12-Oct-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> don't know what to say @GlorymanRTS some get some rains coin when chatting or contributing

[12-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's rather just a by product of contributing and being part of the community.

[12-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> rather than leeching

[12-Oct-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Benohanlon-Mod> I'd like to make a special request of the Equaliser community, which is to please actively share the finalists post for Komodo's Infographic Contest in the groups you're active in on facebook, reddit, bitcoin talk and elsewhere (at least three would be enormously helpful). It's super important to us to get as many eyeballs on this as possible and as much feedback as we can. https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/9n4an7/announcing_5_komodo_infographic_finalists_for_a/. All help and support in sharing would be greatly appreciated by my team.

[12-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not leeching per se, it can be easy to be active in discord and not engage with a server much at all because there are many one is connected to, it more a case of incentivising getting involved and active in the community üëç

[12-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
