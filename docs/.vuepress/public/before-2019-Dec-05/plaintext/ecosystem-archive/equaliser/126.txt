[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> What do you mean by long?

[19-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏> This exchange is shit, its taken me 20 mins to log in, everytime i clicked the recaptcha box to type it in it takes me to a page that explains what a recaptcha is... finally get in and nothing works, cant choose trading pairs, cant click anything and then it takes me all the way back to explaining what a recaptcha is

[19-Jul-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You mean going long as opposed to short?

[19-Jul-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏ at exrates? I had no problems so far other than slow page loads.

[19-Jul-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏> Yer exrates

[dscrdeql] <üá¶üá∫ millsyüêòüí®üí∏> Im just going in circles, after getting out of the recaptcha explanation page it wants me to log in and then says email verification failed even tho i have confirmed it and been beyond the log in but now im back there again
