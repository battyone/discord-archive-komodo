[16-Sep-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I assume without internet for 3 months on purpose? What would you do that to yourself? Haha

[16-Sep-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Complicated. had 2 wait 2x the average time to comission ADSL and took ages for an electrician to get here and work out the old skool wiring haha

[16-Sep-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> sounds like my Dad's place up in the mountains in Tasmania

[16-Sep-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Telstra won't put cable in

[16-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they tried years ago but didn't take it all the way up the mountain

[16-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and what they did put in never worked properly

[16-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so now they have to get an internet from satellite

[16-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> isn't all that reliable though

[16-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The classics are the best.Even pop music back then was art, these days pop is soulless, bland and sounds the same as any other pop performer. (notice I didnt say pop artist) lol

[16-Sep-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> true

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'd rather listen to a dentist drill. atleast you can sample it and vary the pitch and notes to make a new song lol

[16-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> they are the actual artist

[16-Sep-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Sep-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Can you hear a dentist drill if you live above the dentist location?

[16-Sep-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've thought about that as a joke with my wife after we visitted there for a check up

[16-Sep-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Haha, good question. would drive you crazy hearing it all the time in your own domicile
