[29-Jul-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> which makes you see things from a different perspective

[29-Jul-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> well there are more and more ERC20s being made daily

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> give it year and we will prob see almost 3k coins

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> geez

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> most of those ERC20 are scams...

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Quite a few are dead.

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> blockchain as a service is going to become a factor

[29-Jul-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> so why do they still appear in the market?

[29-Jul-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
