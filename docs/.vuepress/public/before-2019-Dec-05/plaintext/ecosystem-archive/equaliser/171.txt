[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> anyone feel free to mod telegram. the attacks begin

[24-Jul-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We  are at stage three - First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win

[24-Jul-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i wish i could...sry

[24-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder I really dislike telegram

[24-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agreed

[24-Jul-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> everytime im on a telegram channel i feel like i need a shower

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> LOL.

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Sounds like Twitter, to me.

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ya that too. more bots than people

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> worse then twitter in my opinion

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep exactly c2k bots everywhere

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and then you have people impersonating others

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well yeah a bit like twitter actually

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[24-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Uhhg, dentist sucks

[24-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its not fun however, it is a line of communication when people need it.

[24-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We will answer

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> on twitter at least you have these cool giveaways

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well its still pretty quiet on telegram if it gets busier i will do my best to pop in every now and then

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Where you send 1 eth and get 20 eth back

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> You dont have those in telegram 😦

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> LOL

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> there are people that don't know about discord

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but I don't think I would be qualified to answer the fudders when they come around

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lolol

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Cryptoon thats a good deal how do I sign up? 😂

[24-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Just be aware that FUD is a tactic, not a legitimate concern.

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well has there been any fud yet biomech?

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah just follow some big crypto twitter accounts, they pop up from time to time

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not a whole lot, honestly. That will come.

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But as I do not have 1 eth I am unable to participate 😦

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Maybe sell some kmd for ETH

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But not sure

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> As kmd is the new eth for sure ;p

[24-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I have 1 ETH. Homie ain't signing up 😄

[24-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @Biomech-Founder Yeah it does then once we pass that stage people will start trying to do scams with the EQLI name

[24-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I always notice fake accounts in twitter that scam eth. best and most effective thing to do is report accounts.

[24-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
