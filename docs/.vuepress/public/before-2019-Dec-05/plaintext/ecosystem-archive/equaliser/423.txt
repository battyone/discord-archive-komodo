[dscrdeql] <c2k> you mean what scammer

[12-Sep-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I saw one yesterday, not sure now of name...I just laughed at it and closed that discord invite.

[12-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Don't touch anything that claims that sort of ROI, it's not real
..

[12-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I was gullible and bought a coin like that and it went almost to zero.

[12-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Once bitten twice shy

[12-Sep-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I believed it because I wanted it to be true....that's not reality

[12-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nothing is "as safe as houses", other than houses....lucky for Equaliser...in a very unique, special place.

[12-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's why Equaliser will do so well.

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Man, glad they're catching it early instead of what happened here in the states

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> First video is 3 mins about bank fraud irresponsible lending and housing

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 1 million estimated Aussies are in mortgage stress

[12-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've been following Australia's housing market for several years and have been warning people about it only to be laughed at. The common response is that Australia is different. We haven't had a recession in nearly 30 years

[12-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Mike maloney predicted the gfc and sub prime crisis a few years before

[12-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Craziness, people don't care until shit hits the fan

[12-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> True. I often say the warning signs are written on the wall but everyone is looking up (or down at their phones)

[12-Sep-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Very true, especially the latter
