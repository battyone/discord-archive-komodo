[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Pretty good, waiting for family to come over, my sister. She's known to come late, every single time haha. This time we were too late with grocery shopping but we figured she wouldn't be here by the time we came back. And that's about an hour ago haha. How's your morning going?

[19-Aug-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you only sell cars or also other things?

[19-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> My grandfather had a store where he sold mainly second hand items, but he already died when I was very young. I wish he would have lived longer because even though I suck at selling things right now, I still seem to have a certain feel for it. I would have loved to see him at work. I was only 5 when he died, but I still remember where he had his shop

[19-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Bric a brac stores or antiques stores I think? They are great to find weird and wonderful things

[19-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Mostly antiques, but I was too young to remember anything else. I only know I was inside it once and where it was

[19-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They build new houses on that spot now, so couldn't look it up on google streetview üò¶

[19-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Streetview from a pc has a dropdown of timeline of when pics were taken and can date back to about 2008ish

[19-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Thanks, didn't even know that. Hmmm, they started building those houses in 2008

[19-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Makes me remember that I'm on street view somewhere with my girlfriend and my little brother

[19-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can't believe I looked so skinny way back.

[19-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, sometimes lots of things change, but some places just stay the same like forever

[19-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> The house I lived in as a little kid is still there, looking all the same. Only the field of grass changed a little over time, but that's it

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Pfff, my sister is still not here. I said she's known to be late but it's 2 hours now üò±

[19-Aug-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you need to be somewhere at 3 pm, she's the kind of person you need to say she needs to be there at 1 pm (normally)

[19-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> It's normal with most women lol. You dont have to tell them the right time
