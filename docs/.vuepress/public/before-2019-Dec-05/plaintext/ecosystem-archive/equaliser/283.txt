[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> lol

[10-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Guess I'll just have to stick around for a while, eh? üòâ

[10-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anyway @RyanInSiam the more you chat in this room the more you level up and the more EQL you get with the "rains"

[10-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if you send a pm to @Tipsy (EQL) with the command "?level" or "?bal" without quotes you can see where you are

[10-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> A lot more to go, I fear.

[10-Aug-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it goes fast

[10-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's to deter multiple accounts that are not active and are trying to soak up rain. What level does it say you're at?

[10-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Still Level 1.

[10-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> 156 points to go, last I checked.

[10-Aug-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> get to level 2 as soon as you can ryan. talk to you soon. i need some rest

[10-Aug-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> gn all üí§ üí§ üí§

[10-Aug-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @RyanInSiam check your level now?

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You're now showing active in tipsy so will from now on receive rain

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Let me take a look. One moment. üòâ

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Woohoo! Level 2! üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> üëç üòâ

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Good night, @c2k !

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> seems like @AndronicusBass-Founder has some magic up his sleeve

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Thanks again for the invitation!

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> night night c2k

[10-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> np at all. hope you enjoy the ride

[10-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> So, does most of the general chatting here or in #off-topic ?

[10-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> happen here*

[10-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Around this time is usually the less active part of the day across discord in general, its the wee hours of the morning in u.k/europe and getting late at night in u.s.

[10-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This is the main channel

[10-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I understand. Shame as I'm awake here in Asia, but that's okay.

[10-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Sooner or later though, I do need to return to work so can't stay on forever. Hehehe.

[10-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> offtopic is for tipsy rain and general buffoonery lol

[10-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, it will be low activity at the moment because of timezones, although this is my day time in Australia, it is the night shift elsewhere üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Ah, writing from Oz, eh? üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Indeed, lunch time at the moment

[10-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I haven't had breakfast yet, and it's almost 10AM.

[10-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Actually, if you'll pardon me for a moment, I'll go grab some instant noodles. (So healthy, eh?)

[10-Aug-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Brunch is always good, I get queasy if I eat after waking up. Love noodles but too often is not good

[10-Aug-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> True enough.

[10-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> My lunchtime in Sydney

[10-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've just been buying some more EQLI...looks like there's more buying pressure now

[10-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @c2k good night

[10-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Where are you buying, Jelly?

[10-Aug-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> on Exrates

[10-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm trying to make sure I get enough Equaliser for a masternode or three

[10-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It hasn't been decided entirely yet what the number of coins needed for a mn will be...but rumor has its sound 100k

[10-Aug-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Price on Exrates at the moment is less than 1c

[10-Aug-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If it goes up too much then it'll cost a lot more to buy enough for a mn, so I'm trying to get in early and get enough

[10-Aug-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Not familiar with that exchange. Will have to take a look. üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode - Head of Security> @Founders like my new name?!?!?! lol

[10-Aug-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> As for a master node, I always wanted of those. Hehe.

[10-Aug-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Nice, beast!

[10-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Big HoS lol

[10-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What's that in reference to?

[10-Aug-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Morning peeps and have a nice day :)

[10-Aug-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Faisal morning

[10-Aug-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> What's going on, @Catalyst ? You in Asia too? üòâ

[10-Aug-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> :) thanks. Yeap Pakistan to be precise :)

[10-Aug-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @RyanInSiam same but I've always missed out elsewhere on getting one cheaply...so this time I'm making sure I don't miss out.

[10-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode - Head of Security> @AndronicusBass-Founder well i wouldnt get away with a - founder and i wanted a cool name too!

[10-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode - Head of Security> so if anyone gets rowdy, let me know and ill drag them out back

[10-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol

[10-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Nice, @Catalyst ! Have a good number of Pakistani friends here in Thailand

[10-Aug-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Haha, i thought it was in reference to something. Unfortunately there is no self appointed titles here üôÇ

[10-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> it is earned üëç üëå

[10-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> We can earn the "Founder" title? Nice. :p

[10-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha

[10-Aug-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well, almost no self appointed titles üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> lol. Mod or admin, and its a collective, no heads or single bosses of anything. That is the old paradigm of workplaces üòú

[10-Aug-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I worked corporate for years and there were many managers and bosses that let the power get to them, staff morale in those work environments have often been poor, Ive noticed throughout the years üò¶

[10-Aug-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'll be back and forth, just cooking a chicken stew to last me a few days and for lunch, yum

[10-Aug-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Tell me about it. I'm working through 3 jobs within, more or less, the same corporate structure. It's...soul crushing.

[10-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I"m self employed. Which means all the stress of a regular job, without the regular pay...

[10-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But I got no dipshit 'boss' breathing down my neck.

[10-Aug-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I left a well paying Job in I.T to focus on doing this, just getting by and doing odd mining jobs here and there but morale is great with the best team I have ever worked with and working towards helping change in the world

[10-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> On that note...

[10-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Seems a bit dry in here.

[10-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ?rain 20

[10-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Tipsy (EQL)> @jellysmash, @c2k, @Faisal, @Llama, @NWhiskeyTango, @webworker01, @justincawa, @MySoulisNotForSale, @ganjie, @Podmaster, @RyanInSiam, @beastMode, @auscoine

[10-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 13 people? Nobody here tonight üò¶

[10-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ganjie> Gracia's  @Biomech

[10-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Yay!

[10-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Often a lull in activity this time across all discord given the early hours of the morning in u.k and europe and late night in u.s

[10-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Naturally, yeah.

[10-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont think people in china use discord, either its blocked or they use wechat and other chinese apps or justt both

[10-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> thanks biomech üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Likely so, @AndronicusBass-Founder

[10-Aug-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Makes sense. We should probably get WeChat going. I got no idea how üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We have 10 people in wechat üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> lol

[10-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> working on more outreach

[10-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We do?

[10-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Tomorrow, show me how to get there üòõ

[10-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can use google translate. I don't mind sounding like an idiot as long as the idea gets through.

[10-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I don't know what the APIs would look like but have seen another crypto discord use a bot to merge the conversations between various platforms.

[10-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Found this on the web, good to share with Chinese native speakers https://www.newcoins168.com/detail_coinX.xhtml?id=1844572

[10-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> So, for example, discord messages would be relayed by the bot to Telegram, and the reverse would be true too.

[10-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> That way, you have a single conversation across multiple platforms.

[10-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> We have a telegram bridge :)
