[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Man this market üò¢

[10-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> It's so boring

[10-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Money is made in boring markets.

[10-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> posititions are taken in boring markets, money is made on the back end

[10-Aug-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> you just gotta know what you are putting money into and what it will be in the future

[10-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Like when KMD hits $400

[10-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> YES! thats when i bypass the lambo and go for the biggest dome home EQL has üòÉ

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yo yo

[10-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahah kmd has a bright future as eqli will have

[10-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Both are doomed to great success

[10-Aug-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I might pick up some more KMD soon. How much, though, is the question.

[10-Aug-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahah I picked a few when we touched 19 k sats and now we are probably lly gonna go lower üò±

[10-Aug-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Let‚Äôs wait and see

[10-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I still see 10$ eoy call me crazy but I visualize that :p

[10-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning all

[10-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï

[10-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i think KMD buying under 10 dollars is a good call

[10-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> it is a super awesome project with lots of potential really really under valued

[10-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just checked price of EQLI...been all over

[10-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Up and down

[10-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I had bought some at the lowest price and some at the highest price

[10-Aug-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> just for a reference, last price it sold at dICO was roughly 5000 satoshis..

[10-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> when was that initial coin offering?

[10-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> What's perfectly round and fits into round holes perfectly well?

[10-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> A square peg in denial. ü§£

[10-Aug-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah jelly

[10-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 5 k satoshiis that would be like a dream impossible to happen in real life

[10-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I had a dream that Kmd and eqli would be worth together 5% of the total crypto market

[10-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Can it happen ?ü§û

[10-Aug-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> last year, too, was the bottom
then rise
this year close to the bottom
but in 2018 the bottom is higher
and the rise will be higher

The only question is, how long will this happen?

[10-Aug-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep

[10-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I think we can see mass adoption to be fair late 2019

[10-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Or 2020

[10-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 2018 will be the transition year

[10-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 2017 hype year for sure

[10-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> I'm ready to wait
and buy cheap komodo üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye been accumulating the best I can so far

[10-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Not even selling a penny

[10-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> This is a no brainer too good so stay cheap for a long time

[10-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> To *

[10-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Anything can happen i would say with enough exposure

[10-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye but the overall market is maturing which is a good thing

[10-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yes üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Remember when everyone could launch a crappy ico and earn millions with it

[10-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Now things don‚Äôt work like that anymore

[10-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> At least is not as easy

[10-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> People are more ceptic about new projects

[10-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Agreed.. the more crypto mainstreams the harder the scammers find it

[10-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and investing is not as irrational as it was few years back

[10-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I think the best is yet to be seen

[10-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> At the forum, I talked to the bounty hunter.
He says that out of the last 30 ICO
29 is a scam

[10-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> bitcointalk?

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And how many of them survived ??

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> yes BTCT

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 10%

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> None ?

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> üòÆ noice

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> 3%

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> obviously

[10-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> hehe

[10-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> until and unless crypto shows real life usage it will remain a geek thing..

[10-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> that's why i am so excited about EQLI

[10-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> because it is actually a real life project with benefits

[10-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Exactly

[10-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Same as me

[10-Aug-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> I mean yeah Ethereum is good blah blah but i think non of their projects that are untop of that platform exisits in real life

[10-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> ^ my knowlege is limited and i am open to learn more

[10-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> That‚Äôs scary 80% is a lot ..

[10-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ethereum was the first one

[10-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And developed smart contracts which was a innovation

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> But now it‚Äôs just outdated and there‚Äôs at least one project much superior in all aspects than eth

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Well yes but wtf was the kitten war üòÜ

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I don‚Äôt know if you guys know which project I‚Äôm talking about xD

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> KMD

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> The smart kittens was a really failure

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> lol yeah

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> exactly

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Komodo had to help them

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> :p

[10-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Solve their kitties problems

[10-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> that's why i said their usage is yet to be seen

[10-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep

[10-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Still very early stages

[10-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> so most of the shit that went with eth are all but on papers on on magnetic tape or in clouds üòõ

[10-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed

[10-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> that's why i think the dev should should try and bring those projects which can be used by non geeks and we as community should support them

[10-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> but alas.. the big guns are only heere to dump and pump shit üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> I believe that KMD is the all but future thinking..

[10-Aug-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i mean who ever thought of Notary nodes
