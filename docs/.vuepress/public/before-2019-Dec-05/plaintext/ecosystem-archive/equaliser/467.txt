[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Looks like someone dumped some more EQL last night, down to 13 sats

[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Peddy> The buy order book is a joke ... I could destroy it with 1 trade

[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Peddy> Zero 😅

[06-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> It would take over 2 million to clear the buy orders

[06-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> 2 million EQL

[06-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Then sell if that’s what you want to do peddy.

[06-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> let me add some low orders first though haha

[06-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok I’m gonna chill for a second lol.

[06-Oct-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just woke up don’t want to wake up n be mad first thing

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Most of us aren't using the exchange anymore so there are no buy walls

[06-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Until we are on an exchange that people are willing to trust we can't really do anything

[06-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> So how is everyone? 😬
