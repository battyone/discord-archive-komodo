I didn't realise this channel was here until a couple days ago

[04-Oct-18 06:52 AM] jellysmash#6680
Nice

[05-Oct-18 04:52 AM] Dr Debt#0891
I should definitely update here. We have acquired our first property and are now working to finalize recipe, along with all legal paperwork before we take our core sample to test in a lab. Once we have engineer approval, we will the mass produce our blocks and prepare to start our build. 

On another note: you can still buy/sell Equaliser on exrates.me but I recommend transferring coins immediately after purchase or sales
