[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> dang, just a little stress. Caffeine never affected me but B12 does wonders for energy

[15-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Im into herbal tea, I will have to look into jiaogulan, I havent heard of it 😃

[15-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I won't live without coffee 😄

[15-Aug-18 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Don't get me wrong, love the taste of coffee.....just the wake up part doesn't work lol

[15-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode -> monsoon in here today!

[15-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Jiaogulan is a Chinese herb, an adaptogen.

[15-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I went to Italy a couple months ago and got spolied off capachinos n expresso. This US coffe is blah now

[15-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> One small piece of advice: buy the loose leaves, not the tea bags.

[15-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> espresso...made by the gods

[15-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 👍

[15-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I have yet to figure it out, but the jiaogulan leaves have a slight sweetness, but the tea bags are quite bitter.

[15-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> while the tea bags*

[15-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Pardon my English. 😛

[15-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thanks for the tip on that. I often get loose leaf, very rarely teabags. I enjoy dandelion root, jasmine, chai, passion vine among others

[15-Aug-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Are these mainly for flavor or caffeine or relaxing?

[15-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Jiaogulan is for good health.

[15-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> As an adaptogen, it helps to regulate a lot of different things in the body.

[15-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Ahhhh ok

[15-Aug-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Also, as I'm weaning myself off of tons of caffeine, I still like to enjoy something hot.

[15-Aug-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> B12 vitamins are good for waking up, no crash later also

[15-Aug-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Noted. 😉

[15-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Krisen> now what?

[15-Aug-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, I will have to check it out, b12.
