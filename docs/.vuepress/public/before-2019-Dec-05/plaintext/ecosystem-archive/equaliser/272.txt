[dscrdeql] <ghost> Many Russians are not rich.
And the distribution of coins helps them live.
But there are a lot of bounty hunters who immediately sell coins.

[03-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> that is very true

[03-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> there is always work to be done

[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> yes we cannot wait to getto that stage

[03-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> however we need the price to start going up

[03-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> Why do you need a stock exchange? If there is not a single house.
Build the first and the exchange itself will come to you üòÉ

[03-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> building cost money üòâ

[03-Aug-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> higher price also allows for us to more easily acquire partnerships

[03-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> Even the foundation of the first house will affect the price.
Demand - Offer.

Give a picture to people üòÉ
