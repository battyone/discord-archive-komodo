[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> when miners mine they get transaction rewards

[02-Aug-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> so no new coins are created

[02-Aug-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> the above reward is set

[02-Aug-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> There are definitely being coins created according to the current supply http://explore-equaliser.io/ext/getmoneysupply . But alright thank you for the clarification

[02-Aug-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good morning guys

[02-Aug-18 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Morning @x2maano üòÉ

[dscrdeql] <x2maano> üëãüèΩ

[02-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There is a small fraction created in new blocks. This wasn't part of our original plan, but it's part of the way KMD asset chains work, apparently. We'll figure a way to deal with them as we go forward. I have several ideas.

[02-Aug-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And no worries, Smedley, the question will get asked whether it's you or not üòÑ

[02-Aug-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Small fraction?

[02-Aug-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I believe @Biomech-Founder is gonna go Hulk on someone üí™

[02-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> is there any other type of smash? üòâ

[02-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If I have my way, the dumper can have the block reward.

[02-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "you don't lead em' so much" was the quote

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôd like a mounted 50 on my helicopter

[02-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hell I‚Äôd use to to chop trees

[02-Aug-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> and btw, Kubrick was responsible for the NASA "moon" footage

[02-Aug-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Makes sense lol

[02-Aug-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> hope that wasn't too negative.

[02-Aug-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> sorry for my ignorance but who's Kubrick?

[02-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Someboday say moon?

[02-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Stanley Kubrick.

[02-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Director of Full Metal Jacket, 2001 A space Oddysey, A clockwork Orange...

[02-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> like that one that got him killed

[02-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> with Tom Cruze and nicole kidman

[02-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> can't expose the "elite" too much , no matter how "good" you're in with em'

[02-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> for some reason the name of that movie escapes me

[02-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "Eyes wide shut" was the movie

[02-Aug-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> never seen it, they were swingers weren't they?

[02-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I remember that movie...eyes wide shut

[02-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Great movie

[02-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> He gets involved in some illuminati rituals by accident

[02-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Interesting

[02-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Biomech that dumper...holy shit..burn his address

[02-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I didn't know there was a theory about Kubrick filming the moon landing

[02-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Does anyone really believe the USA got people onto the moon and back?

[02-Aug-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't believe it

[02-Aug-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think from what I've seen in docos that the shadows are all wrong on that moon landing footage.

[02-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> not for a second

[02-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> the moon landing was all faked

[02-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> now the question remains, what reasons did "they" have to fake it . . those questions are the ones that lead you to some serious inquiries

[02-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, so it's not just me that thinks it was faked

[02-Aug-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> after years of pondering the question I have come to realize this

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> USA was in a race against Russia to see who could get a man on the moon...lots of pride at stake

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> the reason they fakes it is to make the population of earth believe we live on a spinning ball in a godless universe to go along with their monkey man evolution theory

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> US faked it to win the space race

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> there is no space

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "space maybe the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement"

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe

[02-Aug-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> not maybe

[02-Aug-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Time and space are all illusions if you believe in that spirituality

[02-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[02-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> you said earlier

[02-Aug-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "US faked it to win the space race"

[02-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> but it they never went to the moon, wtf makes you think they even made it to "space" ?

[02-Aug-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> True

[02-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm walking now in illusion

[02-Aug-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Back to work

[02-Aug-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> conspiracy theorists about space?

[02-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> And the opposite

[02-Aug-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Space may be the final frontier but it‚Äôs made in a Hollywood basement

[02-Aug-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ^^^ yup

[02-Aug-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I said that earlier

[02-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> sad part is they throw it in our face.  sadly most of us have our heads up our anal holes to even notice.

[02-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> This is why it was so easy to infiltrate this once great nation I took a vow to protect.

[02-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> *oath

[02-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> They throw the space landing in our face?

[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Foreigner, they did final countdown right?

[02-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I wasn't alive then so i can't say faked or not.

[02-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I can say it is possible today

[02-Aug-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I can't either but I can say that I would be harder to fake than actually go there, not to mention in a time when humans found out how to split an atom

[02-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> You guys watch that redbull dude free dive from the stratasphere?
