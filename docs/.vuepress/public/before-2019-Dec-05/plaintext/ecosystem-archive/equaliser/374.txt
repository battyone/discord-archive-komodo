[25-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> i mean a donut around the middle

[25-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think I'll have to try to shred about 1 - 2kg

[25-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I nomrally put on a little bit over winter

[25-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just feel more hungry

[25-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think it's the cold

[25-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> makes my appetite higher

[25-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> maybe bodies way of say it wants fuel to try to warm the body

[25-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm having issues with my body weight. Everybody is different on that but I alway's have these moments where I want to eat and drink

[25-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only moments when that's not is if I'm busy playing games. It often gives enough distraction for me to forget about wanting to eat something

[26-Aug-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I read somewhere that if someone had been overwieght and/or obese then even if they dropped their weight back to normal, they would never be able to eat the same amount as someone who had never been overweight.

[26-Aug-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so it's important to make sure you don't get to that point

[26-Aug-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> also, I read that once fat cells are created from overeating then they never leave the body.

[26-Aug-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they may shrink but never go away

[26-Aug-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, it's hard to live with 😦

[26-Aug-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I'm heading to bed for now, good night and sleep well everyone 😃

[26-Aug-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Imma fatty

[26-Aug-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[26-Aug-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> The second bowl of cereal is never as good as you thought it would be.
True 😄

[26-Aug-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Morning. The second bowl of cereal is not bad if it's sugary and you utilise the leftover milk that retains the sweetness from the first round haha

[26-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I made pancakes this morning

[26-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I made bacon and put that on top

[26-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> oh and then poured maple syrup on top of it all

[26-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and with coffee

[26-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> soooo good

[26-Aug-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The flavour combo coffee and pancakes with maple syrup, top-notch 👌
