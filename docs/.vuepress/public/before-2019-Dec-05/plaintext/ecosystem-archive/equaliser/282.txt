[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Hey, everyone! Just heard about this project from @c2k !

[10-Aug-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> First positive interaction I've had from unsolicited advertising. Heard some great things about your project and can't wait to learn more. üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @AndronicusBass-Founder maybe you or one of the mod's can help ryan a bit getting aquainted with the discord and project

[10-Aug-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nice. yeah, I used to have an 'about-equaliser' channel but its been deleted but I can advise to get the premise and rundown, I have since updated the website front page with key details under the video which is worthwhile having a look at too and only goes for a bit over a minute. https://www.equaliser.org üëç üëå

[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Founder...of this project? Wow! üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> co-founder indeed, We try to have at least one of us available all the time here in discord. Service and support is important especially since part of our mission is to help people from a portion of profits from building going to people in need.

[10-Aug-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> oh, and if you go to the channel #tipsy-begin and have a read and activate by typing ?begin you will activate the tip bot perks. you may have to be active a bit to level up to be eligible for tips and rains üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Cool. Will definitely take a look.

[10-Aug-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> @c2k started out by explaining that the project will be helping those in need. I heard mention of Puerto Rico?

[10-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i need to do some family stuff. chat in a bit

[10-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> welcome aboard

[10-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Thanks! üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> @AndronicusBass-Founder I asked what other locales are on the potential list for assistance. I myself am located in Southeast Asia (as my name should indicate). Here in Thailand, our late king was a huge proponent of sustainability and self-sufficiency. Providing people with the knowledge and resources to build their local economy, so as to help themselves and one another was huge on his priority list. So, finding out about this project really caught my eye. üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, we went there in May at our own expenses to meet people in the crypto community and we met suppliers and local businesses as well as scouting for land. We saw some of the devastation caused by hurricane maria and people lost their homes and its estimated 4500 lost their lives. if at least we can build private storm shelters for people to escape to so we can help save lives is our dream. We will build homes for people for profit as we are a blockchain business, but a portion of profits go toward getting people into affordable, strong and energy efficient homes

[10-Aug-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> We have a partner in Thailand called Domegaia.

[10-Aug-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> @Llama-Admin tell me more üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Very interesting. üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> And EQL is partnered with this group?

[10-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Yeah, with the founder.

[10-Aug-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> EQLI, that is

[10-Aug-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> "needy" people can't exactly afford their own home though, that's what I don't understand. I mean how is a homeless dude going to afford any kind of shelter? it seems that any potential clients either have to have their own land (like me) or have some kind of nestegg to throw down on housing, weather or not it's cheaper than a "regular" home build. .

[10-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> First off, Welcome @RyanInSiam ! Glad to have you.

[10-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Needy people can't afford it. That's the problem. So we have a two pronged business model.

[10-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Thanks, @Biomech-Founder !

[10-Aug-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> First we sell to those who can afford it, then we take a portion of that to a fund to help or sometimes (depending on circumstance) outright give those in the most need some shelter.

[10-Aug-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> This will be done on a sliding scale, and because of our low cost construction methods (which we will have a hand in developing as well), we can have pretty good profit margins, making more and more housing affordable to the poorest segments of society.

[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> When I first talked to cowboy I was under the assumption that you guys were going to build a bunch of communes, which is why I put up my 2 acres on the table. All I wanted was a "promise" that I can go live there if I ever needed to . .

[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well...

[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I kind of want to do that üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But it's not going to be right out of the gate.

[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> that's all I've  been dreaming of ..

[10-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I very much want to expand to building self sustaining communities.

[10-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> a bunch of like minded people .. loving in an area, doing as we please. . growing our own food n $hit

[10-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Communes, eh? üòõ

[10-Aug-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I should write some articles about how I think that would look and let you guys poke holes in it üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> I‚Äôm sure that we will have communities in the future. Just not right off the bat. 

If communities are what people want then we can definitely arrange that.

[10-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, that. Gotta start somewhere, and a bit small. Prove the concept, then go large üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> of course in the mix will be renewable energy and self sustaining growing techniques, its part of the grand master plan and things come in steps

[10-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> And teslas

[10-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Don‚Äôt forget the teslas

[10-Aug-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I like human powered vehicles, I used to race them years ago.

[10-Aug-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> If I may return to the previous topic...

[10-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Do carry on üòÑ We get a little tangential here.

[10-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> What kind of partnership exists with the DomeGaia folks here in Thailand?

[10-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't have all of the details of the DomeGaia agreement. Ask @CowboyCrypto- Founder , he brokered the deal. I know that some of it is still very NDA, but he may be ready to share more, depending on his recent meeting with them.

[10-Aug-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> However, I was saying just today that we need to talk to people in Thailand. Coincidence? Or are you reading my mind?

[10-Aug-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> üòÑ

[10-Aug-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> You caught me at a bad time, unfortunately, but ask away, I'll be in and out over the next couple hours. Plus, we've discussed rather a lot in here, and @AndronicusBass-Founder is very knowledgeable. I'm primarily the block chain guy, but all of us had the same vision, with some nuances.

[10-Aug-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Thailand seems to be really embracing crypto lately, so we want to encourage that, and help alleviate housing issues. Pretty much everywhere, given time.

[10-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> No worries. Thanks for stopping in, and wonderful to meet you. üòÉ

[10-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Another part of our mission is to set aside funds for disaster relief, so that in events where people find themselves without shelter after various 'acts of god', we can come in and get people into better shelter than squad tents very quickly.

[10-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We're ambitious üòÑ Andy, take it away, I gotta be AFK for a while.
