[31-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did it

[31-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Is there a minimum for OTC? I ended up here from an invite and think this has a lot more potential than I have coin. Don't even have a wallet, just what's here in Discord from tips and rains.

[31-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> time for u to get some then

[31-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i doubt there is a min

[31-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but you can DM a founder and ask

[31-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @spydr

[31-Aug-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> thanks @c2k

[31-Aug-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You can message me if you want @spydr but i really recommend you getting agama and our wallet.

[31-Aug-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once we reach our goal we will close them out. just a disclaimer here on otc deals: these are coins that I purchased with my own funds on exrates, donated back into this project.

[31-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> cool thanks for the info

[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I've been MIA for the past few days, did I miss any major announcements that I need to research?

[31-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> cowboy is pouring and testing some building materials

[31-Aug-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> "cowboy is pouring and testing some building materials"@c2k  that's good to hear

[31-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Although I would like to believe the founders and hate to be a skeptic, I think telling us the public address to the wallet used for the over the counter sale should be given. I think transparency is pretty important especially in the blockchain industries considering it is one of the beauties of it.

[31-Aug-18 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good evening guys

[31-Aug-18 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> curious @Smedley , why is that important?

[31-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no one HAS to do otc trades. you can go to exrates and buy there just as easily

[31-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> besides, i believe (someone correct me if im wrong) if you choose to do otc trade with them, you will send BTC , they give you EQLI, and if they send it to your agama wallet you will see their address in the transaction history. no?

[31-Aug-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CX-9> What the buying price for the org?? Is it running with the last trade price or?

[31-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> @c2k I just think it is important because it was claimed that the EQL being sold otc is from previous buys on exrates.me. The current circulating supply of EQL is pretty low considering the amount sold during DICO. If the funds for the otc trades were coming from EQL not sold during DICO I think it should be known. I personally do not have an issue with EQL not sold during DICO being allocated toward otc trades to gain funding however transparency is important.

[31-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CX-9> What is the buying price for the otc haha

[31-Aug-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok, fair enough

[31-Aug-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> not sure what the buying price is @CX-9 . if youre interested in buying otc i htink u can DM cowboy founder

[31-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CX-9> ok thanks

[31-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> @c2k Additionally it was said that the EQL not sold would be allocated into certain wallets that were labeled with labels detailing what the funds are used for. The team is busy but I am still waiting for this. The blockchain allows for this level of transparency and it should be utilized to protect investors.

[31-Aug-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> sorry I was  mixing concrete lol

[31-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will get done smedley, just have a lot going on right now that is more important than moving coins around.

[31-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> you can look at the rich list and see what's what for the most part.

[31-Aug-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we havent gotten them categorized and public yet but we will at some point. Im much more focused on the mission than the administration currently.

[31-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But I totally see where you are coming from

[31-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> @CowboyCrypto- Founder Its all good I appreciate the response and hard work. You have a small team so I completely understand. Just waiting for these things to invest more to make sure I know the percentage of the whole that I am buying.

[31-Aug-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> understand that as well.

[31-Aug-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I will do my best to make some time for it in the next week.

[31-Aug-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Biomech-Founder if you could start that when you get a free moment.

[31-Aug-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <c2k> regardless of the small step back

[31-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it happens, if you go into something like this thinking it will all go according to plan with no flaws, you are incredibly gullible.

[31-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[31-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have set November as a time because I know we are going to hit snags but I am 98% sure that we have allocated enough time that we will have those worked out and fixed when the time comes.
