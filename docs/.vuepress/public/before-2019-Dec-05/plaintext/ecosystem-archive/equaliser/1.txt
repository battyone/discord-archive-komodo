It is going! We had a bit of a rough start with ppl not being able to swap but now we are running smooth on hyperdex

[15-Jun-18 02:14 PM] RAE#3178
Great to hear - keep up the good work.

The utility of Equaliser has excellent prospect, with adoption it will create prosperity for many people.
All the best moving forward.

Definitely will take a lot of hard work, but I think once the world sees our work and the affordability aspect of our homes, we should have a good future in this space
