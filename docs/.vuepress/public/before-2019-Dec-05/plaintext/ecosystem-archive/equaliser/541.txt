[21-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah the crypto market isn't the most exciting place right now lol

[21-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs turning

[21-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think we will have a similar run to 2017

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i dunno im expecting a slow year

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but who knows

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go as crazy as it did then but we should see significant gains mid summer

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> all the "experts" got it wrong a million times

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but im waiting to see what happens

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> waiting for this magical bottom

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> where ever the hell that is

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hope it comes in a few weeks at the end of a 50k run for me in the car game lol

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> haha that would be nice

[21-Jan-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Bottom of 2800

[21-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will have liquidity then

[21-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ive heard so many numbers

[21-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im guessing anywhere from 1k-3k lol üòÑ

[21-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hope it goes 1k

[21-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> depends on what the big players want to happen

[21-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think the recent bitcoin movement is manipulated hard

[21-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They aren‚Äôt gonna give us an entry that low

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They will pump with etf hype around mid feb

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah if it dips that low ill end up buying back in

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> until then im out got to much shit i need to buy and pay for

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and then dump when the etf gets rejected again?

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Maybe. But it‚Äôll be a higher low

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if it does pump around that time

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ill be tethering

[21-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but we just gonna have to wait and see what happens

[21-Jan-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I‚Äôd tethered at my peak I could have over 100 btc right now

[21-Jan-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üò±

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm not mad. Btc could go to 0 and I am still ahead

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im down

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but im willing to lose everything i put in

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> so not too fussed

[21-Jan-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I reduced my risk

[21-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I got up to 10k and pulled out 2k so at that point I had made 650% profit

[21-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The rest was a free play

[21-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah i should of done that but i didn't

[21-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> got attached early on

[21-Jan-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Which I paid off my house with a few months later

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and since then everything shit it self

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs been rough

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> its been shit

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> buy the dip

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no more dip

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think what we are doing will build a lot of excitement

[21-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah lets hope so

[21-Jan-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no one i know is interested in cryptos anymore

[21-Jan-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Even if it doesn‚Äôt, we will make money on this project

[21-Jan-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> First house sells and I‚Äôll be putting at least half straight back into the books

[21-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ü§ë üè†

[21-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once our first one is done, I have a client who wants a custom home

[21-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 500k usd budget

[21-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yep just need that first house build and sold and from there it should be good times

[21-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yup

[21-Jan-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs so close but still a little ways off

[21-Jan-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Probably turned out good that the market had been crap giving you time to concentrate on building

[21-Jan-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Plus even if you built and sold I don't think the current market gives a shit lol

[21-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[21-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Well I‚Äôve seen 5 projects claiming they are building something in real life.

[21-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> None have

[21-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Yeah too many empty promises

[21-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Most projects are a joke

[21-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> Can't wait for most coins to die

[21-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exactly. Which is why I try hard to keep all of you in the loop about what I‚Äôm doing

[21-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm enjoying the journey

[21-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'll wait then until the contracts are signed on the 4acres before tweeting anything about it.

[21-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto thanks for keeping us in the loop

[21-Jan-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Appreciated

[21-Jan-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah once I get the ink dry we can start talking about it

[21-Jan-19 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
