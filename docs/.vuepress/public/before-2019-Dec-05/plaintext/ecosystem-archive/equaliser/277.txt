[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Whats the problem with your land? Is it heritage listed of some sort?

[09-Aug-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i like seeing the EQL quote tighten up on exrates...more people getting involved

[09-Aug-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i put in a bid an hour ago thinking i would get hit with BTC tanking...but other bids started to creep in there. the offers havent really moved but at least buyers showing up. and no big offers to speak of until 35sats

[09-Aug-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @AndronicusBass-Founder other than it's out in the sticks? I don't know

[09-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @AndronicusBass-Founder also there are really no restrictions out there. .I sent cowboy all the "regs" that were given to me by the county

[09-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hmm, lets see how it goes later down the track. Want to be able to provide service for as many as humanly possible.

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> well, damn, there's a bunch of cheap land that where my land is

[09-Aug-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> woah, that's cheap. I would love to live on remote rural land and be self sufficient. I've had an interest in permaculture for a few years, its intriguing and can grow food much faster and efficiently.

[09-Aug-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I was impatient . . . I paid $1500 for my 2 acres ..  but yes. . . you can go through the county and get them for $300 per 2 acre plot

[09-Aug-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its crazy, when you buy land you should be able to do what ever you like. I know in australia, heritage listed land is cheaper because you really cant do anything on it, to protect the native landscape.

[09-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> 1500 is still damn cheap ðŸ˜ƒ
