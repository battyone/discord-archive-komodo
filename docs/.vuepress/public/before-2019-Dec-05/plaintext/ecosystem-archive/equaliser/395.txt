[dscrdeql] <spydr> The first ones I saw (tv) I thought were a joke. Like prank or pretend. Then I started looking at some that serious people built and was amazed.

[01-Sep-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> you can be like in that southpark adaptation

[01-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People collecting free rain and not HODLing dont realise that when we are trading above $5 or $10 in the next couple years, the amount of EQLI required to build a house will be much less so a lot of savings and a chance to own a home pennies to the dollar

[01-Sep-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thats my opinion, Banks are having to look at raising interest rates and tightening mortgage lending. its been too easy to get a mortgage and people are feeling the strain and unable to refinance, being turned away from banks

In the areas youve planned whats the process to getting citizenship

Pricing can vary from a number of factors ranging from location, build size and type, build design, materials etc.

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, that's right @AndronicusBass-Founder

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> time to HODL

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> people if they get rains should hold on to that

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> selling would be idiotic, especially when they got it for free

[01-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they've got nothing to lose in keeping it for the long term, since they didn't outlay anything for it.

[01-Sep-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so HODL my good people

[01-Sep-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Same as always. Saturday night behind the keyboard üòÉ how are you?

[01-Sep-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm just up for about an hour, stayed in bed for too long haha, but all doing good üòÉ

[01-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yay for the weekend üôå

[01-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's strange to have weekends again, since the whole summer vacation felt like a very long weekend. Now it's only 2 day's in a week.

[01-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But that makes us even enjoy it more üòÉ

[01-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> weekends are awesome

[01-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but 2 days is not enough

[01-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> too much to do on weekends

[01-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> imagine a 3 or 4 day weekend

[01-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that'd be soooo good

[01-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe 4 days of work, and then 4 days of weekend

[01-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just the way nature intended it to be

[01-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> lol

[01-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> for no apparent reason

[01-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
