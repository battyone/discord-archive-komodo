[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i shot up with the storm yesterday lol

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Nice

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> was like bam

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> kapow

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> How much did you make it rain then?

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I missed it completely üò¶

[24-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah. Also, once we start getting well known, it will ruffle some feathers whether we want to or not. So they'll whisper things in the ears of useful idiots, who will shout them on Twitter/Telegram/Facebook and Bitcointalk.

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Just keep plowing away

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> keep doing your thing

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep biomech it happens we will shut them up though the right way üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> step by step

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and congrats on your new rank cryptoon

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> let actions speak louder than words etc

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Thanks @CombatWombat !

[24-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That's the beauty of FUD from a tactical standpoint. Most of the people srpeading it have NO CLUE that they're being useful idiots. They'd pass a polygraph üòõ

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That's because 90% of the population are really stupid

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> and believe anything they hear

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> you are correct both of you

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its sad üò¶

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Probably 95% even

[24-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Every new project, that is for sure. Me having a deadset opinion against federal politicians in Australia utilising tax benefits of property investment, gets my goat, even though I cant afford a goat haha

[24-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The current system is flawed

[24-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I disagree.

[24-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> that's putting it nicely

[24-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The current system works exactly as intended. You're just not the beneficiary.

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's evil, but it's not flawed greatly.

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its flawed for majority of people

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not flawed for a select few

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i call that flawed

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòÇ

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's not FOR the majority. Systems of rulership never are.

[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nah i get what you are saying though Biomech... the system works for what it is intended to do

[24-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We are cattle to them. Our concerns only concern them to the limit of revolution.

[24-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Which is why I'm more interested in building better, more independent humans, not different systems of rulership. Strong humans don't need rulers, and if there's enough of them, then the rulers become irrelevant and powerless.

[24-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Biomech-Founder i never explained to you how federal politicians in australia take advatage of a tax benefit that was brought in to action in the 80's to stimulate property investment when interest rates were above 10%. The negative gearing benefit is still used when interest rates are at historic lows currently

[24-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the problem is majority of humans want to be ruled

[24-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and some need to be ruled

[24-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No need, Andy. Same here, differnt title.

[24-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> hey everyone! on my lunch break right now!

[24-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yes, the majority do 'want' to be ruled. Because they are carefully conditioned from birth to be that way.

[24-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's not an easy process üòÑ

[24-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Which is why we are Equaliser.

[24-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There will always be leaders. But a true leader is not a ruler. People follow of their own free will.

[24-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> A true leader needs to know how to be a servant

[24-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Absolutely.

[24-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üíØ

[24-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And common phrases like "you can't fight City Hall" and it's ilk need to be rooted out, exposed to the light like the bloodsucking memes they are, and ridiculed openly.

[24-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> A build is commissioned with the purchase in our coin, there is no competition between those with wealth and those that struggle to save for a deposit on a mortgage. Equaliser is non-discriminative which is how we planned Equaliser to be, just that, an Equaliser to be able to buy a home to live.

[24-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> btw, im sure this is helping the crypto space today...

[dscrdeql] <c2k> new crypto ETF to be listed

[24-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Thought the decision wasnt until august 10th?

[24-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its all speculation still

[24-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Can't hurt too bad üòÑ The problem that most anarchists have is that we don't work to subvert the existing system, we just rail against it.That's ineffective üòÑ

[24-Jul-18 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm about subverting it, outcompeting it, and NOT replacing it when it falls.

[24-Jul-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Governments have no say in my preference to trade my personal cordless drill for a grass cutter. human to human

[24-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> "Strong humans don't need rulers" I'm keeping that quote @Biomech-Founder üòÉ

[24-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I value the cordless drill as personal property to trade like I value digital personal property to trade whenever I want.

[24-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the powers that be want to define what we as humans want to use

[24-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I think we need rulers.. humans have had them since the beginning but my idea of a ruler differs to what we have now. A true ruler/rulers that is actually there to benefit the people not just a select few

[24-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> look at the magna carta. no human is above another. we are all equal

[24-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep but who follows that reasoning?

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> context? explanation?

[24-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That story illustrates the system I think would actually work. But it has to start small and grow organically.

[24-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> doubt i will have the time to read that lol

[24-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
