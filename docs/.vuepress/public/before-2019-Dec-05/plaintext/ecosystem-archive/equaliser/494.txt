Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Satoshi Nakamoto
satoshin@gmx.com
www.bitcoin.org
Abstract.
   A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online
payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a
financial institution.   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The   network   timestamps   transactions   by   hashing   them   into   an   ongoing   chain   of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work.   The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The
network itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> ahhh what a day!

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> woooooooooooooooooooooo

[31-Oct-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well done cowboy 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im getting there.

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> just have been cursed with limited funds and even less time.

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We will manage though!

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> stex is a great start

[31-Oct-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I think stex is a great exchange.

[31-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and yeah hopefully the market can pick up and boost those funds

[31-Oct-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Nice job Cowboy 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it took me 20 days of grinding hard to get the money to list there lol.

[31-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And it payed off 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> now we just gotta maintain a decent trading volume and see where this leads us. If everyone stays active on it, then we will be fine as I can build houses while others trade.

[31-Oct-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So awsome that this comes pretty much combined with the raisex listing too, feels so awsome to see EQLI going to be listed on two exchanges. That must get some attention from people if they check the twitter accounts

[31-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'll announce it on twitter once we are listed and live.

[31-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but I always try to keep all of you here in discord in the loop when I recieve info

[31-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Did anyone else hear that?

[31-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think I hear thunder

[31-Oct-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lovely thunder 😄

[31-Oct-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Morning all

[31-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[31-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Kids did trick or treating yesterday..

[31-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The youngest ones

[31-Oct-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Came home with a heap of lollies

[31-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I wish they didn't get so much,

[31-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> There's a few streets around us that do it

[31-Oct-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But not that many in sydney

[31-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The thing about volume...I've berm thinking about it..is that we need enough sellers...ppl can't buy if ppl don't sell. So to get volume we sellers as well as buyers....I don't want to sell though, or maybe I could a small amount but not too much. We need that dumper again to get the ball rolling...maybe...not sure how we can maintain consistent volume.

[31-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @c2k I had never read that abstract of btc..interesting

[31-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I don't want to sell some but I can sell my discord balance. Most of it was leftover from exrates anyway

[31-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> About 10k, not sure if that's enough to putt up some orders, but I'd like to hold on to the rest I have

[31-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Maybe once build starts and some more good news of progress is released them New ppl may join and buy in top equaliser.

[31-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I have no doubt news on the build will create lots off demand to buy EQLI

[31-Oct-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i never read the bitcoin whitepaper either. it was like opening a brand new Beatles Abby Road LP. 😂
