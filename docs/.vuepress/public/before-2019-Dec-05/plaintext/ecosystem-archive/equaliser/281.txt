[dscrdeql] <c2k> is there a way to see when new peoople join discord

[09-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ?

[09-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <FishyGuts> Some bots can be setup to do this.

[09-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hi @FishyGuts

[dscrdeql] <FishyGuts> Hi @c2k

[09-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> your real estate expertise will be welcomed with open arms here. although i think all the founders are currently busy

[09-Aug-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Sup @FishyGuts

[09-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <FishyGuts> International law is far different than US law for real estate but I am glad to help if I can.
Cowboy also seems to be well versed in what he is doing.   
Excited about what you guys can provide!

[09-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just up a bit to check prices

[09-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> don't want to become too obsessed by them

[09-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> oh well there are worse things in life

[09-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when price gets to where it should be this room is going to light up like a christmas tree

[09-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...yes very true

[09-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Hopefully we don't have to wait for Santa Clause though

[09-Aug-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good point

[09-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> What do you expect the price to go to, realistically, once we start coming out of this bear  @c2k

[09-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I figure 1000-1500 sats but I could be way off

[09-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> personally, once the team gets some things done that makes the vision clearer as well as implement their MN strategy and get on at least one more exchange, i can see price moving to 1000 quite easily.

[09-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> hey peeps!

[09-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Steve10 and i think that can all be done by end of yr

[09-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> hey there  @c2k

[09-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Steve10 and we should all be doing out part to make it happen. like retweeting what founders tweet, creating our own EQL content via posts and tweets, and inviting people into this discord

[09-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ...our part

[09-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I don't like to speculate on prices but I agree we should hit those ranges

[09-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> all I know is EQLI is extremely undervalued

[09-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Sounds good!

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really need to get a twitter account up and starting, I don't have any social media besides 1 twitter account with zero activity/followers haha. Never been into it so far, only discord

[09-Aug-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and a great source of information for KMD and EQL (etc) related news

[09-Aug-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah that's why I think I should start to actively use a twitter account, but I just hate all that social media stuff so I never used it before
