[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And it will probably get buy orders up a lot

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> begin from scratch

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> level up all over

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> new skin

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> new feeling

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> new EQLI

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> new skin?

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> what new skin?

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> new kick ass

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> metaphorically

[13-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> new skin ...like shedding old skin

[13-Aug-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and growing new improved skin

[13-Aug-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> like some animals do

[13-Aug-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are we using EQL or EQLI? It's hard to say which one because on exrates it's still EQL

[13-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> EQLI

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Just look at Tipsy's name

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> constant reminder

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Going forward, it will be EQLI. It was supposed to be at exrates, too, but they screwed it up ðŸ˜›

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are they planning on changing it?

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or will they keep it as EQL?

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> isnt something like that done on a chain level?

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No idea. We asked.

[13-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, it's just a label.

[13-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> For barterdex, yes, but that's because of the atomic swaps. On an exchange, they could call it 'bob' as long as it taks to the right daemon.

[13-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Would be funny if that happened for a day

[13-Aug-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or is there already a bob coin out there?ðŸ˜‚

[13-Aug-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No idea. But there really should be ðŸ˜„ Maybe I'll make it for shits and giggles.

[13-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Cryptopia has WC listed, made me laugh

[13-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And of course...

[13-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That would be the coin symbol ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Be good to get EQLI code on coin market cap....just to help resolve any confusion

[13-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Hehehe

[13-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Haha ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yeah, Jelly, we're on it.

[13-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Fake patience, I am ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> First place I go to when I see a potential coin is cmc

[13-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Good to know you're on the case

[13-Aug-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> CMC dropped vol requirements I think its a great time to get EQLI on there

[13-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I believe, but cannot prove, that some projects have a back door to CMC.

[13-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Agree about cmc

[13-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The requirements don't make sense to the coins listed.

[13-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> I know for a fact one small coin I've been messing with has been trying forever to get on there and always rejected due to volume but recently got on after reapplying now that restrictions are lowered

[13-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> and vol is still low lol

[13-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hope you're right. Not my department. I'd probably piss 'em off ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But Evan and Cypher are on it, we heard ya ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> cool cool

[13-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Soon as CMC is connected, Tipsy has auto convert features for seeing your balances in both BTC and USD

[13-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> ðŸ˜›

[13-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> totally cool!

[13-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> So we need trading volume to get on cmc

[13-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Didn't realize

[13-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> We probably don't have enough just yet

[13-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Hopefully soon though

[13-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Let's see how this bounty campaign runs.

[13-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But if the volume has been lowered to something reasonable for small projects, we'll get there ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok so im just reading this now

[dscrdeql] <c2k> its definitely a party in the other room. im getting dizzy trying to follow the action

[13-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <justincawa> do you get level points by talking in #off-topic or just in here?

[13-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> @c2k been working a lot

[13-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> working on an acquisition of my company and its daughter company

[13-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So yeah stressful and long days

[13-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Not that much time for crypto fooling around :p

[13-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> also can't say that I liked seeing my level 50 rank get stripped away

[13-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> probably rained over 3k or so in here so yea

[13-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That's no fun

[13-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> @justincawa anywhere you see Tipsy in member list you get XP

[13-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Good job man

[13-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Cryptoon there is a plan to reward higher level holders with EQLI

[13-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Itâ€™s because of the bounty no ??

[13-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> We still have that data ðŸ˜‰

[13-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye I guess so

[13-Aug-18 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I was only@level 5 before this happened

[13-Aug-18 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And now Iâ€™m back to level 1 but with more xp xD

[13-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> Lol start chatting folks

[13-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blademaster> Oh man back to square one ðŸ”²

[13-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yup, all of us starting from zero again

[13-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> we've been zeroed

[13-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> only to be reborn

[13-Aug-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Yea it feels good to be reborn or born again I should say lol

[13-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> What does it mean to reward higher level holders with EQLI? Is that the past or current levels? Or is it about people that have a lot of EQLI?

[13-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Thats for the current level update

[13-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Let's hope it gets a lot of activity from new people

[13-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Most of us obviously have enough bought on exrates ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> I agree ðŸ˜„

[13-Aug-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'll probably send some more over to discord for future rains if I buy more on exrates

[13-Aug-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Will be nice to rain once new people get in

[13-Aug-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Yeah and thats will keep them on and also have them invite friends to join

[13-Aug-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸŒŸKQweciâ˜„-Mod> Hmmm the new update is full of surprises when you level up and they will really enjoy it
