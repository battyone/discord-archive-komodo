[14-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> be interesting to see how it goes tomorrow

[14-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> another trade

[14-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha..also maybe another new level

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hopefully the next level again

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> the current market isn't helping

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> no, that's true

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> alts are getting destroyed

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> all markets have dropped big time

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> everything so cheap

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, so cheap...

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> KMD below a dollar

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i wish I had fiat to buy more

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> üò±

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I have to wait until payday in another week and a half

[14-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> alts will be back up somewhat by then

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah i think so

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for me the only coin im thiniking of buying more of in this crypto slaughter is eqli

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I bought KMD yesterday.....and then within 10 hours....boom down it goes

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have a feeling kmd is destined for $1

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> unfort

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> im waiting for my withdrawal üçø

[14-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've had to wait up to a day for my withdrawal of eqli to go through

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they say on their website that it can take up to 48 hours

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah haha

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's a manual process for them

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> at the moment

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i know

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but at these single digit eqli prices your downside is so little it makes sense to load up

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it will get there eventually though

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i feel good when they arrive üòÑ

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> usually by the time I wake up, the funds have been transferred

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> my first one was the longest

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Best to keep price discussions in cryptotalk, not everyone wants to chat about the current markets lol.

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> last withdrawal came within 30 mins

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've done about 4 withdraws now

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> shortest was around a couple of hours

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @AndronicusBass-Founder üëç

[14-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> longest was about a day

[14-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> @AndronicusBass-Founder ‚¨á  ‚¨á  ‚¨á  ‚¨á  ‚¨á

[14-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> lol

[14-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> lol...no one wants to talk about the carnage of those other coins

[14-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> EQLI is pretty good

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> well looks like that guy is trying ultra hard to have 'fun'

[14-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe if he says it with more conviction....he'll convince himself that's what he's feeling

[14-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like most crypto investors....lol

[14-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> when you're buying because it has meaning like with Equaliser then yes, can be fun

[14-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> looks a bit like he's saying some other F word

[14-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> sooo looks like the bounty starts tomorrow

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> be interesting to see what comes out of it

[14-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> wish I new more people to tell Equaliser about
