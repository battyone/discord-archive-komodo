[27-Jul-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i havent traded much off barterdex recently. is 1% is more than other exchanges?

[27-Jul-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Having these traditional companies try to get in on this feels like when facebook went from cool to an ad driven wasteland
