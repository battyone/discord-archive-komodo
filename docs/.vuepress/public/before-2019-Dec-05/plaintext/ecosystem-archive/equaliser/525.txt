[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hi there @Mommesh

[29-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Any plans to publish a reworked roadmap as there have many changes to the roadmap included in the whitepaper? Also any plans to have AMA's again?

[29-Nov-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not sure

[29-Nov-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Working on it, given the setbacks we published about, we are still pushing forward with building and growing.

[29-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Unfortunately when it comes to building there's a bit of planning and getting materials ready and certified. I believe that is the current stage of development @peddycb

[29-Nov-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> If a mod or admin gets a chance it would probably help to get listed on another coin listing website like coinpaprika so its easier to find information and also update https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/equaliser with the current supply so potential investors can see the marketcap

[29-Nov-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's  @Smedley, good idea

[29-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> One of the founders will probably have to look at that

[29-Nov-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I've tried a few times at getting Equaliser listed on various exchanges and they all say the application has to be done by one of the devs/founders

[29-Nov-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> If someone knows how to query the blockexplorer to get the total supply and also the address holding the rewards funds so I can get the circulating supply I could fill out the forms

@gordonkomodo 100k EQLI 4x 90days = 360days = 40%
100k EQL 1x 365days = 30%
or I have a misconception ?
Twitter

[29-Nov-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> is it on purpose that locking 90 days for 4 times to be more profitable than locking 365 days ?

[29-Nov-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to revise it. I suppose

[29-Nov-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I thought the percentages where per annum....meaning that 10% pa for 90 days means 10% for the whole year if you repeatedly invested for 90 days.

[29-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You need a per annum percentage to get a good comparison of ROI.

[29-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Correct

[29-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> it is not clear if the rate is per Annum

[29-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Gordon Komodo> so it is per annum?

[29-Nov-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is per annum

[29-Nov-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think it has pa after the percentage which means per annum

[29-Nov-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm brain dead today

[29-Nov-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But maybe worth saying per annum just to be absolutely clear

[29-Nov-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's ok  @CowboyCrypto

[29-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve got a toothache and I‚Äôve been at it for 12 hrs straight

[29-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And pouring blocks

[29-Nov-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm hoping that we have data back by Christmas on our compressive strength and tensile strength

[29-Nov-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Then I‚Äôve got to kick it up a notch on production.

[29-Nov-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My goal, after we get results, is to be producing around 100 blocks a day. This translates to a 2500 sq ft home every 10 days

[29-Nov-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So, in theory, I should be able to build about 3 homes per month once we have blocks with pipelined circulation

[29-Nov-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If we can raise enough funds, I‚Äôll be producing 1000 blocks a day and building neighborhoods in months, but that‚Äôs a little way away

[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> So will you be transporting the blocks or pouring them on site?  @CowboyCrypto

[30-Nov-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pouring in a warehouse

[30-Nov-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They have to cure before using

[30-Nov-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So basically I will pour everyday then place them on a pallet and put them in a separate storage area.

[30-Nov-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So to answer your question transport

[30-Nov-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> When we go to PR, we will be shipping our forms and renting a warehouse where we can pour and build
