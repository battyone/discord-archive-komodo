[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> 🌚🌑

[21-Jan-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think another exchange is needed maybe crex24?  but the KMD wallet has been down for ever on crex

[21-Jan-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s been in maintenance on all exchanges

[21-Jan-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think once we get momentum stex will pick up

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Due to sapling implementation

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah but KMD has been in maintenance for ages on crex

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> way before this

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> a few times I was gonna buy some kmd but wallets were down

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m thinking cryptobridge and yobit

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no yobit

[21-Jan-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> dont do it

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ve dealt with them soooooo many times.

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i would never trust an exchange that advertises pump and dumps

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> sends email for them as well

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats pathetic

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s got a massive user base though

[21-Jan-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well up to you

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but when wallets go down

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and they never come back up again

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> then you will say its not worth it

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im a few discord groups

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it happened to them

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know exactly what you speak of

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> they spent months trying to get yobit to update wallets

[21-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah cryptobridge is where I originally wanted to be

[21-Jan-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i honestly like crex24 and cryptobridge is good but i don't like how you need that coin to trade

[21-Jan-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i also think once a house is built and sold bigger exchanges will start looking at eqli

[21-Jan-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lots of users on cb

[21-Jan-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> especially when volume starts to increase

[21-Jan-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Liquidity is what we need more

[21-Jan-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Most

[21-Jan-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep i agree

[21-Jan-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Support in the exchange will entice buyers when they know it’s not going to Hell if one person decides to dump

[21-Jan-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> haha yeah thats true

[21-Jan-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> doesn't look too good right now but hopefully that changes

[21-Jan-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’ll be aight

[21-Jan-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m making 0.1 every 5 days mining

[21-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ve been buying eqli with it

[21-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.01*

[21-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not bad

[21-Jan-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m about to switch to create a separate portfolio and see if I can catch a few 30% swings

[21-Jan-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> goodluck

[21-Jan-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Thx lol I’m looking at a few coins

[21-Jan-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i need cryptopia back

[21-Jan-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> few coins i got main volume was on cryptopia

[21-Jan-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> which stuffed me up

[21-Jan-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I knew when Alan quit topia was goin down

[21-Jan-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> wallet guy?

[21-Jan-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No ceo

[21-Jan-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> oh

[21-Jan-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> apparently wallet team changed a week before this hack

[21-Jan-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> anyways i think i will be watching equalizer 2 tonight lol

[21-Jan-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s awesome!

[21-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Speaking of wallets. I moved my 130 kmd to ledger wallet before the fork, now they're stuck there. Have to wait eventually for ledger to update their kmd wallet. Should have just kept using agama. Once I can get them out, I'll move them back to agama

[21-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I lost my Trezor

[21-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Faaarrrk!

[21-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Is it around home or you may have lost it out of home?

[21-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day all

[21-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Howdy @nille

[21-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> @AndronicusBass-Founder  hello

[21-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> hope you backed up the pass phrase for your trezor @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[21-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[21-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Think all I had on it was some dragon and some sirin

[21-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Xhv exit scammed

[21-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People bailing in crypto because their projects are only focused on being alternative currency and nothing more. The status quo system is too far gone, rather than expelling energy fighting it and trying to change it, I believe the rewards will be greater in building the foundations of the new paradigm that broader society will eventually realise is the better way.

[21-Jan-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> This is the ground level and a lot of work to do however, the tables are tilted and not in the average joe or jills favour. We are building a weight to counter the disadvantage.

[21-Jan-19 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Morning all

[21-Jan-19 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[21-Jan-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Morning, yeah I need me one or two of those

[21-Jan-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pretty cool stuff

[22-Jan-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Great functionality

[22-Jan-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Woah, I guess the time frame can be custom, trust fund almost/inheritance

[22-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah so if god forbid I died my funds could be recovered to an heir acct

[22-Jan-19 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day all

[22-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> Are Crytpo conditions rewards contracts still to be implemented (as was stated) at or before block 205,000?

[22-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <digital bullion> Not being impatient. Statement was made. We are at 204,854.

[22-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> once cc activated at 205000, after that we can implement 😉

[22-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> great, nearly there
