1 - VIX is showing complacency in the stock markets which is often one of many tell tale signs of a market correction around the corner. "Be fearful when others are greedy" Also the average cycle of U.S recessions is due about now or I though in 2016.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That equates at this moment to AUD47,078

[09-Sep-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That put's it in perspective. exorbitant down payments for motgages in developed countries I believe is the result of lending tightening from the banks, as there is too much credit and equity in the system.

[09-Sep-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> :EQLI: Equaliser provides access to a great store of value in real estate. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.

[09-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> :EQLI: Equaliser won't contribute to already inflated established property market prices and a fraction of profits are used for helping those in natural disasters and also subsidies for some that need assistance owning a home.
