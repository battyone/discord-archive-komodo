[10-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @MassimoStyle yea, got the workout in

[10-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Killed it in less time than normal

[10-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just ploughed through it

[10-Oct-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @FishyGuts what tipbot? Tip bots dont need to be setup locally in my experience.

[10-Oct-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Be cautious of anything if you need to setup on your local pc, I haven't seen any tip bots that do that, they are always on a server somewhere and connected to discord like a user

[10-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> 🏋️‍♂️ 🏋️‍♂️ lift those weights

[10-Oct-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 💪

[10-Oct-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I, misread that. You mean if someone has their own discord server. At first glance I thought you meant discord program on PC. Damn I need some sleep

[10-Oct-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We blew up the foam machine 😂😂😂

[11-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Did it actually blow up? Is that why there is white stuff strewn about?

[11-Oct-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well I almost crapped in my own pants when it happened because it was a loud boom.

[11-Oct-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Thanks, I'm not quite sure about it, so will see how it goes..it's an internal project.

[11-Oct-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good to let red wine air a bit

[11-Oct-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> and migrate what ?  what kind of data ?

[11-Oct-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Sometimes the wine is better a couple of days after Opening it

[11-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Sql is source and some proprietary system the destination (IBM)

[11-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> so SQL to db2 😄

[11-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've been told just export data from sql into file of a certain format and IBM import into their System

[11-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> sql -  mssql, mysql... :?

[11-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Doesn't sound too hard

[11-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Not sure of the destination format...might just be xml file

[11-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> yeap 😃

[11-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> and agree doesn't sound to hard 😄

[11-Oct-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I opened bottle red wine last night...should be good tonight

[11-Oct-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Gotta love server migrations. Best one I did was SAP business one 2007a to 8.81 and at the same time from windows server 2003 SQL 2000 to Windows server 2012 and SQL 2008 r2 from memory. Experts we paid for advice missed out 1 step of the upgrade roadmap of SAP B1 that I happened to notice before implementing and I wasn't an SAP B1 expert 😂

[11-Oct-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> lol 😃  and eveything was ok 😄

[11-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Once it was done, was all good.

[11-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> even documented the B1UP customisation and reimplemented it successfully

[11-Oct-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm done with I.T though, too much stress. I'm all for both workplace safety jobs and EQLI house construction

[11-Oct-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, lots of stress

[11-Oct-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'd rather be doing my own thing, but gotta pay the bills

[11-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> gotta agree with u both 😄
