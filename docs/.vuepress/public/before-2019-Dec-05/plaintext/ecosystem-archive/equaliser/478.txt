[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> If you want a good coin to go for now before it gets more exposure, check out verus coin, chris the fella that keeps releasing new miners for it ,just doubled the mining speed for cpu‚Äôs to mine it , i was getting 34mh/s on an old amd cpu from like 5-7 years ago , its now getting 94-100 mh/s on 3/4 cores

[12-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am focused on the task at hand: getting what we need to build.

[12-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Sorry for advertising another coin in here, its just very exiting at the moment

[12-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the fastest way i can do that is to hustle lol

[12-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and that stays in the ol crypto bank until its worth 0.003 btc

[12-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> I tend to come across a lot of Bitcoin MAXIMALISTS in my travels and they just dismiss all altcoins off as sh*t coins not worth the effort to mine or talk about, it can be very depressing listening to them some times, then other times i just laugh my head off with some of the bs they come out with

[12-Oct-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> You carnt win them all i have to keep reminding myself üòÇ

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[12-Oct-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I plan on having that entire area lined with forms for blocks.

[12-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> How long does it usually take for 1 block to cure ?

[12-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> should be making around 20 blocks a day

[12-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im waiting on the fiber to come in to really test that

[12-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 28 days without fiber.

[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have read that it significantly reduces cure time to like 18 days or something like that.

[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> by the end of november I will be building unless its just frigid out.

[12-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> I wish you all the luck in the world you get no hicups along the way, nice work so far @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[12-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have a good team and good friends that are going to help me.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> everyone here likes the idea of spending winter in Puerto Rico üòÑ

[12-Oct-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am going to make radius inserts as well to build the domes with.

[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so that I can still butt them up making curvature without sacrificing on integrity

[12-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Nice!

[12-Oct-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> I know we all will be looking forward to seeing your progress in due time,

[12-Oct-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto good one...radius inserts will be a must.

[12-Oct-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I‚Äôve got an insert for your radius

[12-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Whatever that means ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[12-Oct-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <criptovanadium> Im back to channel

[12-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lmfao

[12-Oct-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> radius inserts make the blocks form a circle. @PigBenis

[12-Oct-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Oh I could guess what a radius insert was, but I was just playing up my sexual innuendo

[12-Oct-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Lol

[12-Oct-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's the concrete supports that are dug in Amd embedded into the ground around the radius of the dome. The steel supports that go up and across to meet at the top center of the dome are connected to these radial inserts. So these radial inserts give lateral support to the dome, otherwise the base would start slipping outwards and crack the dome.

[12-Oct-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What a sentence to finish on on ü§£

[12-Oct-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha...growing up I hope means you don't have to say that in the first place

[13-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Very wise words. You know those times walking along a foot path and a group of people or even just 2 or 3 take up the whole width and dont move? They expect you to go around them probably because their logic is based on numbers however, if they drive on the road like that they would have a head on collision. Thats the times you want to tell them straight up but something way better is to pretend to trip up in front of them like you are going to fall into them and watch their faces, Gold!! and turns the negative thoughts into a good ol laugh üòÇ

[13-Oct-18 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
