[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Sure, we can put building on hold and consolidate our recourses into making a faucet and giving away coins lol. We are currently working hard towards working product which will boost awareness and value of equaliser üòâ üëå ‚úå

[12-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> also btc-alpha has low listing fees

[12-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> this raining and faucets can encourage users to participate in listing vote contest

[12-Oct-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> we already have the rains which have helped tons of people check the amount of rain dropped you will be amazed why do we need a faucet for? :D¬¥

[12-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> some people dont use discord

[12-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> encourage them to use it  then üòÉ

[12-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> theres rains for so many asset chains on kmd now

[12-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> even on kmd.. and the only thing you have to do is owning a komodo address which can be valid for all the assets chains that can be run on the lite mode agama wallet

[12-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> which all of them do expect pirate which you have to run native..

[12-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Kmd has a tipbot that rains kmd for all the people on discord , chainzilla now has one also and equaliser has the rain bot

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Ive already had 3 double espressos, did an all nighter. glad i did because the plce next door is getting demolished and It would have got my blood boiling getting woken up to it on a sat morning. Property development. Smaller dwellings, higher prices

[12-Oct-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Love that picture of the dome surrounded by destroyed buildings , not that destroyed buildings are a nice sight , but that dome actually looks pretty darn good , would make an excellent advertising billboard ,if not for the devastated population of people that went through that catastrophe

[12-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I know what you mean.

[12-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It kind of looks like its made from adobe

[12-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> It would make a good conversation starter that though

[12-Oct-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> I will show this to all that i try to explain the Equaliser project to , it might help them understand better what its all about

[12-Oct-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Thanks for sharing this with us

[12-Oct-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Cheers. Yeah I've found that it takes different wording for different people to picture what Equaliser is all about

[12-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've condensed the key points into dot points in #welcome-invite its the last post which is from me

[12-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> After all the info out there, i saw a question on bitcointalk which blew me away. let me find it, 2 secs

[12-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Ok , thanks for that aswell @AndronicusBass-Founder

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> "Who pays to build the low cost houses, and do the builders need to accept your token? I want to understand the economics of your idea, it is a noble goal, but where is the wealth coming from to build the houses, from the ico?"

[12-Oct-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> üòÅ i must admit, i too had similar questions when i first heard about this project, i mean im still fairly new here but iv learnt some things along the way that helped me understand better

[12-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> i have been wondering where did the trivia and stuff go?

[12-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> A lot of people just dont want to read things , they just want to be told or shown the answers, iv found doing your own research first and then if you have got questions afterwards its ok to ask , but a bit more effort on the research side helps understand the full picture so much better, ( everyone absorbs information in there own little ways , so taking the time to find out the facts and then come to your own conclusions works best ) in my opinion anyway

[12-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Exactly. Im lucky enough that research has been a past time or hobby if you will, Over half a decade of learning economic fundamentals and some Australian law as well as a number of other things. I just know the global economy cant continue to sustain the amount of debt it's in and only a matter of time when credit cycles deleverage.

[12-Oct-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just saw that dome pic with destroyed houses around it....lol....it's actually so small it reminds me of one of those wood fire pizza ovens...

[12-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @stretcher83 yes interesting point that people read different things into what they hear and read.

[12-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's why it's important to get the Equaliser name out through different type media, and different interest groups

[12-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I want to build a wood fire oven, in high school i had a part time job as a wood oven pizza chef, cooked heaps of things in it for food prep too, roasted capsicum, marinated chicken for the pastas, baguettes, calzones

[12-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not just crypto

[12-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You can buy them for home from Bunnings I believe

[12-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Theyre small. Looks good though.

[12-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Never tried making pizza in one before though

[12-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They do add a great taste tip the pizza

[12-Oct-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have a great aircrete recipe you can build one with andy.
