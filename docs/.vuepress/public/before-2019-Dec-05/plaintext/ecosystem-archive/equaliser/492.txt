[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> everyone We will soon be listed on a new exchange. Thank you all for your continued patience and support. I know we may not always look to be doing alot, but we are always working toward our goal. A few of the founders are doing what they need to do to get through in the real world, further proving to me that our mission is one of necessity. I'll be around but I will be mostly working here at my shop this week to get everything ready to start producing blocks for the first build. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to voice them in #suggestionsüì´

[29-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I gave no intentions of stopping

[29-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> have*

[29-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> great

[29-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've been messaging raisex everyday for 2 weeks lol

[29-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> hey there are a lot of new exchanges like mnd sharedax aiodex etc

[29-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> kalkul

[29-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> what they charge? i think they shall charge a very low fee for listing as they are new

[29-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah but I am very cautious of new exchanges.

[29-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Maple is a prime example of why

[29-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> old is gold

[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> plus I havent had an exchange yet than our promotional team trades on regularly.

[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol You'll see when it all starts coming together.

[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My advice? get as much as you can as cheap as you can.

[29-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> i am not trader

[29-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> but i shall promote

[29-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We appreciate all of the help we can get.

[29-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good work

[29-Oct-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus i have another announcement to make later on once we get rolling that will be pretty awesome in my opinion.

[29-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ankushferozepur> best of luck

[29-Oct-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah I think newer exchanges are risky

[29-Oct-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Since exrates, the next listing(s) are important and need to be considered carefully

[29-Oct-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wanted to share this with you guys, I did this last year when I worked as a core member for B3. The community turned toxic as inflation drove people to dump in mass quantities, but I am good at what I do. I know how to make a coin a legitimate currency.

[29-Oct-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol and I was tired AF because I had worked almost 30 hrs straight and then drove 5 hours to get the car.

[29-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Deadtorights> Thanks

[29-Oct-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Yo!!

[29-Oct-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> hi

[29-Oct-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Amazing things keep happening when I work on this! Was just reunited with an old friend that is also an alternative building enthusiast! Mr Green helped me make my first blocks when I was building a concrete block home here locally and I just ran into him and he invited me out to his how to show me a groundbreaking discovery he made with Shotcrete!  If this man says he figured something new out, you can take that to the bank, he's the hardest worker i've ever met and super knowledgable on building. We worked on some ICF  building at his house before ICF was a thing!

[29-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Morning all

[29-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ‚òï

[29-Oct-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Sounds like you've got a good plan there @CowboyCrypto

[29-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Thanks for the hard work and effort

[29-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it wasnt planned.

[29-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well the previous part was but running into jeff was not

[29-Oct-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I went to get parts to fix one of the cars i have and he was there, buying a pump for his concrete sprayer.

[29-Oct-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Idc if your are religious or whatnot, but I find way too many things that happen to  be a coincidence at this point

[29-Oct-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Amazing how that synchronicity works..yes I do believe in it..it's the universe supporting you

[29-Oct-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the little things just keep coming to me the harder I work

[29-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> love to hear that cowboy

[29-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thanks for the update

[29-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I don't view things as a coincidence anymore like I used to. I fully believe everything happens for a reason and lines up how it does for a reason

[29-Oct-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, I think that's true. there's an underlying reason

[29-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there's a common saying in my circle, the harder I try, the luckier I get.

[29-Oct-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Haha...I like that

[29-Oct-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Some people can just make things happen

[29-Oct-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes it's not a coincidence that were all here

[29-Oct-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> We all have something to learn and do here.

[29-Oct-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
