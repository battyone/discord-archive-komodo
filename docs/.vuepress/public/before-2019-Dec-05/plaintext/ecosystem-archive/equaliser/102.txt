@Cryptoon are you thinking that the outside area may be inefficient or some interior space that may be un useable?

[17-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Thinking mostly interior/exterior, as in the height the space can't be used optimally given the arches?

[17-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But don't get me wrong, domes are great for nature resistant homes
