[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 😃

[10-Aug-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> yeah i should have plugged kmd

[10-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> hehe i was checking a few days back and i mean they really are thinking ahead

[10-Aug-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> if all the hashrate of zec+kmd+equihash (all) combines and attacks the network of KMD i.e. more than 51% of the network..

[10-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> they would just be doing a thing other than taking control of the network and that would be making the difficulty go through the roof

[10-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> and what they be getting 3 KMD per block 😛

[10-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i mean seriously.. a network this strong is still underrated and still invisible to most of the crypto world

[10-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> give me a break!!

[10-Aug-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Really the biggest use of ethereum has been tokens. And they clog it up. Komodos asset chains are a little harder to make, but they actually add to the security of the chain rather than the subtracting from it. Because they have a separate blockchain and the notary nodes kind of work both ways. The data from the notary nodes relates to the asset chains and both gets recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain. Ethereum on the other hand, can be stolen by thinking bad thoughts. Yeah I'm biased. But I'm not wrong.

[10-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Hello Biased 😛

[10-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
