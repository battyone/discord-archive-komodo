[dscrdeql] <Cypher> stuff like this getting annoying

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> we could use a hand getting our platforms busy again

[07-Jun-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> we will explain our ideas fairly soon

[07-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hey cypher 👋

[07-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hey wombat 😃

[07-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> you good?

[07-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yea all good here how about you

[07-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> not too bad thanks

[07-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I see the announcement but there is no vote link there

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> button to push, under the pinned announcement. One for a new direction, one for a community takeover. So far the vote has been for the new direction, rather overwhelmingly, except for the fact that there ain't many votes 😛

[07-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Тамара> 🚀Hello! Good news!
❗️Вinаncе-team  opened Margin Trading!

[08-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> after a week of voting with the ratio of 25:1 you would like for Cypher and Bio to run the project, we would like to restructure the team and open it up much more as we develop our main focus will be tech for the meantime and anything real world in terms of building etc will be down the line, if you are interested in joining the reformed team please dm me with you skills and how you feel you can help steer us in the correct direction, if you have any ideas for a rebrand please also let me know this is a long road but we are glad that you have our backs and we aim to deliver with your support. along side this we aim to do more regular updates, if you feel that we miss something please just say and we will endeavour to sort it

[08-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Adding to the above: Both of us have to work for wages at this point, so the progress will NOT be rapid. Our first order of business, starting tomorrow, will be to come up with a rough schedule and a few initial goals. The more people we can get involved with the goals, the faster they will go, but we are going to lay out a tentative roadmap that's based on a realistic timeframe with only the two of us in overall charge of the project. This likely means weekly meetings and weekly goals. We will be using the Agile framework to measure, evaluate, and meet these goals.

[08-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And lastly, thank you for the vote of confidence! I honestly thought the vote would have looked about like it does, but the other direction 😄

[08-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> We trust you guys at least I do , anything I could do to help I will  keep spreading the word about this project!

[08-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> we know you will do better than before for sure

[08-Jun-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, first things first. We gotta get organized. Cypher and I are meeting tomorrow to come up  with when we can work and a tentative set of goals. When we get that far, we'll be inviting some of you to a separate server for a bit more in depth meeting. This isn't secret, it's just about team building. Some of you will want in, some of you won't, and that's cool either way.

[08-Jun-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As far as spreading the word, let's be a little low key about that until a plan is in place. Creating hype right now is probably counterproductive. I'm guessing, as we haven't got details yet, but I'd suspect about a 60 day timeline to the point where we'll get aggressive again.

[08-Jun-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Don't take that as a 'gag order' 😄 I'm just saying keep it low key. Something like Equaliser is being reorganized 😄

[08-Jun-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Sounds fair to anyone and I completly aggree with that approach

[08-Jun-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> everyone I look forward to contributing to the new direction. My schedule at my new job is not very consistent but it's alot of hours. When I'm not there I can put any time needed to help make this work. I would like to see a project statement regarding cowboy.  In the long run it will save alot of people in the future. Don't want to see that bastard near another coin management wise

[09-Jun-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day everyone

[09-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hello everyone! As Hannibal would say, I like it when a plan comes together

[09-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I'm not a dev, just an investor, but will be quietly watching and when the time is right I'll gladly help spread the news

[09-Jun-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Hey guys I hear you , indeed we will set our goals again and achieve them for sure at this time you guys will be successful

[09-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Are you guys in charge of Equalizer twitter?

[09-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> to do the project statement via there?

[09-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, we're not. We will set up new social media.

[09-Jun-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Bonged> I see , good plan

[09-Jun-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> we are laying them out

[09-Jun-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> it will take some time to ramp back up but we will get there 😃

[09-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> So this equalizer twitter will be shut down then?

[09-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Maybe. It has officially ceased to be relevant. We don't have control over it.

[09-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ok

[10-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <GoldMine> Good morning guys 😃

[10-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> hello all

[10-Jun-19 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hey

[10-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Hey guys 😃 so lots of work today ?

[10-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> every day 😛

[10-Jun-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We're working out the tentative plan. One expectation I can set right out the gate: Cypher and I both work full time and what went before left no funds. So, we're going to be working on this primarily on our day off, which for me is Sunday. We'll lay out projects and time frames, but until things get turned around, it's going to be a long process. If we can get ahead of schedule at any time, you best believe we will, but the new direction will be "Slow and steady wins the race". 
I'm not a patient man, so that's not easy for me. But that's the way it has to be for the immediate future.

[10-Jun-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also, for any of you using/contemplating using KomodoOcean, here's the official guide. I'm also gonna put this in announcements and pin it.

[10-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day peoples

[12-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hey hows your day going ?

[12-Jun-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @Cypher He's just a bot or someone for the rains only

[12-Jun-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I doubt he's even checking if there's rains or not

[12-Jun-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> See his chat history:facepalm:

[12-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hahaha

[12-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> makes sense now i still need some coffee at least it keeps the chat going LMAO

[12-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> how did he get apprentice rank ? ahh right the rains haha

[12-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I suggest some sort of cleanup is needed when we move on, unless we plan to keep the rain system

[12-Jun-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But the obvious rain sellers are still here checking their balance at times

[12-Jun-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> there will be a cleanup for fresh blood

[12-Jun-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> well he cant get nay more rain now haha

[12-Jun-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I do have to say that for a good coin, a rain system can bring in more people, as some of us (me included lol) came for the rain but stayed and bought, but there's lots of other coins out there without any rain bots

[12-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> tipsy is pretty amazing there are ideas to improve it, but its up to aus what he wants to do with it 😃 i feel she will be about in the new iteration of the project

[12-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> to help with getting people in and im sure we will grow better in the future 😃

[dscrdeql] <Cypher> renewables are amazing recently read a paper on how an island is storing their power in electric car batteries, so they can drive during the day and over night the cars are put into reverse power mode and put the power back into the grid

[15-Jun-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> pretty smart way to store and use it more efficiently
