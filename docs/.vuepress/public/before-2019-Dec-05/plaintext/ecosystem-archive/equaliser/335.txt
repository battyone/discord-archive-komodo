[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's alway's bad news üò¶

[17-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Last week there was a car accident and some woman started to film it, didn't move for ambulance and stuff like that

[17-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yeah stupid people filming everything

[17-Aug-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sometimes I'm afraid that if I ever need help, someone will grab his phone and no, not to call 911, but to video everything

[17-Aug-18 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> üòÑ may be may be

[17-Aug-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If it were 'good' news, most people wouldn't read it. Sensationalism rules.

[17-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As for the videoing of everything... I have very mixed emotions on that. It is exposing what everybody outside of the suburbs already knew, that the cops are the most violent gang out there, and they can't get out of it so easily any more. Despite more and more 'laws' restricting any investigation of their malfeasance.

[17-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> On the other hand, I can see the scenario That @SwimedDragon is saying being a reality.

[17-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> So hopefully, there'd be two people. The asshole looking for news, and a human with ethics üòÑ

[17-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> @SwimedDragon that‚Äôs so true.. very sad tho

[17-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't even have a mobile that can video haha

[17-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I have to say my next phone will be 1 of those

[17-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> @SwimedDragon when xxxtentacion died people just videoed everything.,

[17-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> I have a iPhone 6s getting a iPhone 8plus soon

[17-Aug-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> there's mobiles without cameras that still function?

[17-Aug-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Wouldn't have thought you could find a network for a 15 year old phone.

[17-Aug-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Maybe flip phones

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, it was only 10 euro's. It does what I want. Phone and text üòÑ

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They still make these types

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nah, got two. Both have a camera üòõ

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> I have a iPhone 6s

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Getting a iPhone 8plus

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They been in my junk drawer for nearly two decades, but they have cameras.

[17-Aug-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Both have working camaras

[17-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Why would anyone want an iPhone? You can get ten android phones with the same or better specs, and they aren't slow as god like the apples.

[17-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ...this should probably be in #off-topic

[17-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Yeah

[17-Aug-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Still need to get used to move things to off topic üòÉ

[17-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just another level of security

[17-Aug-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Yep

[17-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> EQLI didn't really move on exrates, not even since we have lots of new people

[17-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think they're only sponging the rain now

[17-Aug-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> nice to have a command for the links

[17-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I have in the past had trouble finding them

[17-Aug-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <rjmahan> Who owns legal title to the property while built ? How is this linked to the crypto itself?

[17-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> title ownership and registration using smart contracts

[17-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> required to 'purchase' the dwelling using EQLI crypto as well

[17-Aug-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <rjmahan> Legally ?

[17-Aug-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> all of our transactions will be 100% legally compliant.

[17-Aug-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> one of our attorneys specializes in real estate law in PR, so we will be within the parameters they need to be compliant on all levels.

[17-Aug-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't forget to add this info in off-topic too since most of the new people go to there

[17-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, it's a great point to know

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Goodnight @SwimedDragon

[17-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> how to use exrates? lol

[17-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> exrates: 1 create an account, 2. transfer btc or Eth to your wallet on exrates. 3. place some buy orders by setting a limit or click on a item from teh 'sell' list and click the 'accept' button..

[17-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> 4. withdraw EQLI from exrates to your own wallet.

[17-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's pretty much same steps for any exchange

[17-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> unless you're using fiat

[17-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haven't used fiat on exrates

[17-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> imagine i't s probably the same though as buying with btc....send fiat to your account on exrates and place a buy order

[17-Aug-18 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> good night
