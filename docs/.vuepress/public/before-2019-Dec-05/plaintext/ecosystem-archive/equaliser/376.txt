[26-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jester21> @SquireAu what is it?

[26-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> @AndronicusBass-Founder  So another PM has been shown the door. I really don't understand politics anymore. In fact when Gough Whitlam was sacked I didn't vote again until Bob Hawke  landed the job

[26-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> hi @jester21 just passing by

[26-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> @AndronicusBass-Founder perhaps your too young to remember?

[26-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I never registered to vote, I dont believe in party politics. Its all a puppet show

[26-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Corruption and rotating doors

[26-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Malcom and ScoMo didnt want a banking royal commission and look at all the fraud and malpractice it's already turned over in Australian banking and financial industry

[26-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've unsubscribed to the status quo and this dream world paradigm we are currently in because its unjust and too many people are slipping under the poverty line and struggle with making ends meet. Well I plan to help change the world and hope it becomes a snowball effect. i want to make affordable housing and donate some to those worse off

[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> good on you, you heart is in the right place. good luck I hope you achieve your target. yes I have been following the banking rc on tv, as I used to work for westpac and I personally was not in a position to rip off customers I was aware that it could be happening and that management encouraged it

[26-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, its been found managers where aware but their responses were as if they didnt know. It was their job to know so their justifications often dont hold water haha

[26-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> it was interesting to see them squirm under questioning

[26-Aug-18 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
