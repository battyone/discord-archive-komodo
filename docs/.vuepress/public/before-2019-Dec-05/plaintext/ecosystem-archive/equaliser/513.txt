[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> People dumping this at this sats range

[18-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> It‚Äôs just ridiculous

[18-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> True

[18-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I have nearly 1 mil coins and I‚Äôm not selling one until we trade at a decent sat range .

[18-Nov-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Some ppl are in fear....

[18-Nov-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @Buddz1993 nice one

[18-Nov-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> At least 1000 sats its achievable

[18-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Agree....easily

[18-Nov-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> When cc are implemented we should see those sats

[18-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yes, for sure

[18-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Can't wait...the rewards will be awesome

[18-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I mean I don‚Äôt know why people sell at 30-50 sats or even less

[18-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Blows my mind

[18-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> A lot of ppl will be scrambling to get enough for a masternode or three or four our more

[18-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye 4 masternodes means you need 400 k

[18-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Or so

[18-Nov-18 07:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> At this price it‚Äôs still cheap to get .

[18-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Might be a stupid question but can it be possible to have those masternode contracts be able to be used on discord in some sort of way. Maybe lots of people don't want to buy a masternode, but if the discord bot can have some sort of rewards, similiar like the masternode contracts, it might get lots of people to buy some smaller amounts as it will be easy to earn passive rewards, even if they only have a wallet on exchange and discord.

[18-Nov-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @SwimedDragon no, I don't think so

[18-Nov-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The whole point of the rewards is a "reward " for HODL ing

[18-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No

[18-Nov-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Imagine trying top get 20 - 30% return anywhere else

[18-Nov-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> That's why the rewards are so cool

[18-Nov-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You need a minimum amount for kmd rewards as well

[18-Nov-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> HODL reward

[18-Nov-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once we start pumping our houses and content out, 10k sats is my projected stabilization

[18-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 12 months from now I‚Äôm hoping we are closer to 100k

[18-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is it possible to lock coins up if multiple people donate to one adress, for example a bot account on discord?

[18-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No

[18-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At those prices I don't see a lot of people buying 100k coins, but it would get small spenders interested

[18-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> At that point they won‚Äôt be able to

[18-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Rewards are just that.

[18-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Now back to what you said dragon, yes users could pool their coins for rewards contracts but I advise against it unless you really trust the person running the wallet

[18-Nov-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah I know it's about trusting someone else with coins, but that's why I would say to use a discord bot that one of the team sets up. Or simply something set up by the team.

[18-Nov-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At 10k sats per EQLI I can see a lot of people holding small amounts

[18-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Even if it's just from rains, if they're on discord, they want to add it to something that gives extra rewards. And when the rewards are good, they feel like buying more, and read more about EQLI

[18-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No. We have a large enough workload as it is.

[18-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They're are some shared masternode services around......one got hacked about 2 weeks ago, or the owner did a runner...can you trust them?

[18-Nov-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Sorry man I‚Äôm spread thin as it is.

[18-Nov-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok, just trying to think of ideas to get people in üòÉ

[18-Nov-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I work 18-20 hrs a day as it is

[18-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå That's why I would say that some system hosted by the team would be great, but I understand it's a lot of work to do and keep it up and running

[18-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it is a lot of work man

[18-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Plus add another 40hrs a week I have to allocate to building houses

[18-Nov-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some other coins use a discord/rain bot and let those coins stake on discord, which makes it very interesting for people to join in if they barely have to do anything. On some coins, rewards are great and it makes people buy and read up more about a coin.

[18-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> That's why I thought it might be something to use since it could get a lot of people in if the crypto discords get more activity again

[18-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Didn't know that  @SwimedDragon

[18-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Interesting

[18-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think the best example I have seen is with that Vitae token coin

[18-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice

[18-Nov-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Someone invited me to there once, and I think price was about 1-2k sats each

[18-Nov-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And they do a lot of small rains, a lot of them over the day, but that coin stakes on their discord bot, and you can even putt your coins in a masternode system on their discord bot. Rewards are great, and it makes people buy more

[18-Nov-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I didn't had any money to buy Vitae, but in the end I ended up selling some Vitae coins

[18-Nov-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But the thing is, they had a lot of people in, and it only takes a few people to read up more or just buy more because rewards are good

[18-Nov-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some of us had a similiar experience here, we joined for the rain and end up buying

[18-Nov-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> To be real though, nearly all the discord users we have now, have been here for a while, when masternode rewards where first mentioned...they've had a lot of opportunity to buy cheap.

[18-Nov-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah but essentially you‚Äôre asking us to rain to give you free coin then you want us to also stake it for you and buy it from you when you go to sell em

[18-Nov-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs a terrible business model. I don‚Äôt like the rains honestly as it devalues our project

[18-Nov-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But you guys like them so we keep them here

[18-Nov-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, I think some coins just allocate an amount to do that, and sometimes it does seem to work, but yeah I would have mixed feelings to use it on a coin like EQLI

[18-Nov-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It does get some ppl in through the door

[18-Nov-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Chalk it up tip marketing costs..like a free sample

[18-Nov-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It got me in actually

[18-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But look at what Vitae's price was/is on cryptopia. Like I said, it's just an example and obviously wouldn't work on any coin if you'd try it out randomly, but their discord has lots of people in and that's what they want to achieve

[18-Nov-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Just hope they convert to be a true believer

[18-Nov-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some coins had thousands when discord was more populated, and a few hundred online at times. You only need a small amount of people to actually buy, and even if people sell coins they get from rains, it would create some volume. But I get that it's easier said then done

[18-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But as for now, I have to say the rain bot isn't of any great use
