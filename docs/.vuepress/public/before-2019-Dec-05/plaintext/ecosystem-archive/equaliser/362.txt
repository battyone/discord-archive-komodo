[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[22-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if you look at some projects when they first started

[22-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> like KMD for instance, they take a while to get traction

[22-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont thin EQLI is any different

[22-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its a viable product, solves a problem, and can be mass adapted for both personal and commercial uses

[22-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there are plenty of things to keep peopole interested in the project

[22-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its just a matter of getting them here or getting the exposure

[22-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have to run for now...chat later

[22-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, it takes time, but we have time üòÉ

[22-Aug-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Grats on the level up and see you later

[22-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> nice one leveling up @c2k

[22-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> taking longer to get through these levels

[22-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> now, after about level 6

[22-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> takes a little longer

[22-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but just means more chatting

[22-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> not a bad thing

[22-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I've noticed the same. I usually chat a lot and even I find it hard to level up now

[22-Aug-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And I don't think rain would help a lot to get up

[22-Aug-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It might do at the early levels but once higher up, you need to rain very much if you want to do it purely for levels

[22-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Writing this here because I think my chat can get flooded away in off topic fast. But what is/are the bounties for reaching milestone levels or secret room(s)?

[22-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I thought I read the first 100 will get it, but do we get it once 100 people make it to there?

[22-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think that will take a long while for now haha

[22-Aug-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I expected lots of new people to chat and chat to level up but we seem to be here with almost the same group again

[22-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> hey everyone!

[22-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i hope you all are doing well!

[22-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i start work in about 15 minutes here

[22-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good luck on that üòÉ Since that talk we had yesterday, I keep thinking that you have a hard drive home sometimes when tired

[22-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Drive safely when you're done with work

[22-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you still having those 12 hour day's?

[22-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good night

[22-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, going to sleep for real now, haha

[22-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good night sleep well everyone üòÉ

[22-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hey there.

[22-Aug-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> good night @SwimedDragon

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's hard to move away from discord

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I know been there

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and I end up getting to work late

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> almost every day since I started using discord

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I always think...just one more....just one more

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and it goes on and on and on

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and then I'm late

[22-Aug-18 10:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> makes me ride like an idiot on my motorscooter to try to make up some time

[22-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...not the safest rider out there

[22-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but you can't go that fast on a 125cc

[22-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> or even accelerate for that matter

[22-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> accelleration is pretty crappy

[22-Aug-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but ok, just for commuting

[22-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> be interesting to have something like a 500cc or a 1000cc

[22-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just to see what's it's like

[22-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> on a small bike would be awesome

[22-Aug-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> small enough to get through traffic between cars, but fast acceleration to get out in front safely

[22-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> anyways, time for me to go to work now....i hope.

[22-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> going, going......gone

[22-Aug-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Time to make that coffee machine work hard

[22-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Numerous times

[22-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå I've owned several motorcycles in my time . .

[23-Aug-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I will never ride a bike again

[23-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> they'e way too dangerous

[23-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> some dude on a bike today right in front of my truck. . cuts me off in the middle lane and his back wheel almost slid out from under him

[23-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I would have run right over him .. he would have had no chance to survive
