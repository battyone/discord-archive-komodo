[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @MySoulisNotForSale you got most of them look again

[24-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Well my ones anyway

[24-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Rains are good but this project is better

[24-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Rocky start with the exchange but the goals of this project are üíØ

[24-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> We should be much more excited about that

[24-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Hello

[24-Jul-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> good convo

[24-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone heard of the Australian bank commission investigation?

[24-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> us Aussies get shit done. Investigate the banks. üëå

[24-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Lol

[24-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Nope, that's good though they should. Here in the states we just bailed the banks out with little to no stipulations

[24-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> in reality the system isn't bad the problem is the system is corrupt and and people don't see how the system is actually going against what the system is supposed to do

[24-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> from what I know pretty much every American president has broken the american constitution

[24-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> hard to have a good system if the fail point is always people

[24-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> true @CombatWombat

[24-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the system is far from perfect but the bigger problem is the people in power don't really follow it if that makes sense

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> ABC is state funded but gives you an idea that it is true. http://www.abc.net.au/news/story-streams/banking-royal-commission/

[24-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> it does and it's the main problem with all hierachy systems, top rarely cares about what's below. It's why I really believe in decentralization (KMD, EQL, etc)

[24-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yup üëå

[24-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It is possible to decentralise a government.

[24-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Governments are good for country infrastructure (roads, bridges, parks, etc) and defense from the crazies but I don't think they should touch monetary policy. Here wallstreet wants capitalism when things are going well and socialism when things are going not so well

[24-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agreed, it certainly is possible. but eventough its possicle, there needs to be a desire to do it...or a revolution. and it takes tiiiiimmmmmeeee. davinci knew it was possible to fly but it didnt come to fruition for quiet a while

[dscrdeql] <c2k> from the 1400's! lol

[24-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> the people should have more power over the government

[24-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> :EQLI:

[24-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha

[24-Jul-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> one of my favorite movie quotes "People should not be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people"

[24-Jul-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Jonathan Governments are perceived by people that infrastructure is a product of taxes. Taxes pay the interest that governments owe to central banks. You're not aware of that?

[24-Jul-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I am but they don't spend that money on those things, at least here they don't

[24-Jul-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> True that bro. all gov is the same.

[24-Jul-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Listened to that banking commission video @AndronicusBass-Founder - crazy but sounds very familiar

[24-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> no it's not my voice if that's what you may think.

[24-Jul-18 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its a similar position for everyone

[24-Jul-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> sounds familiar meaning that the greed mentality happens here and appearently everywhere

[24-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In developed countries we pay taxes to service the debt that governments increase consistently.

[24-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> loans and mortgages increase the broad money supply which is why groceries are damn expensive.

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> fact! bank of England defined, and parliament debated it officially.

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how much does a house cost were you are bass?

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> how many rooms?

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> what land size?

[24-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> damn that's crazy

[24-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> just a normal basic house nothing small nothing too big

[24-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Liveable and no need for aircon or heater? or you want sub surface heating or your choice of colour exterior? Questions you need to have answered if you plan on building with equaliser. We got your back.
