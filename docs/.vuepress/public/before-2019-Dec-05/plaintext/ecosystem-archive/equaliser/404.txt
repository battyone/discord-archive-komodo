[04-Sep-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> they do dICO's, have 2 DEX's, and a growing ecosystem

[04-Sep-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Is it platform?

[04-Sep-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Ahh ok

[04-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> like eth but much better

[04-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> they can do many many more transactions per second

[04-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> K

[04-Sep-18 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> took me a few months to learn about everythig because they have so much goin on

[04-Sep-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> No. Not yet

[04-Sep-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no not a dev. but been involved  with kmd since last yr

[04-Sep-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Send invite please?

[04-Sep-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sent

[04-Sep-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> spend a little time reading the whitepaper. thats the "easy" part i guess

[04-Sep-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> their DEX is very forward although can be a little clunkuy to use. its not that intuitive yet but 100% anonymous

[04-Sep-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and if you hold KMD in their Agama wallet you often get airdrops

[04-Sep-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its a growing ecosystem. if you re looking for a very forward thinking and visionary ecosystem i think u will like it a lot

[04-Sep-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I was in here this morning. And bought about 125 kmd

[04-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> The price looked good to me

[04-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when you want to see your level you can check in off-topic or DM the Tipsy(eqli) bot.
bype "?level" to check your level and "?bal" to check your balance
both without """"

[04-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 125 kmd is a good start

[04-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> did u put it in the agama wallet?

[04-Sep-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Yes

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> So you say it have airdrop?

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good. you get the 5% rewards there

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> 5%? Like staking?

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the latest airdrop was for Chainzilla

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes 5% rewards for staking

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Hmmmm

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> claim maybe 1x per week and it compounds

[04-Sep-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> When was airdrop

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> And how to claim?

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> aug 15th record date and aug 30th airdrop date

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no more claim for them.

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> BUT, you can still get in on bounties

[04-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> they do one every day or 2

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sent you invite if you want to look into it

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> You confused me

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sry.

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> I have to claim 5% komodo?

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no

[04-Sep-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once in agama it accrues the reward automatically

[04-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you will see what youre "earning" in a green box

[04-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> How often

[04-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> whenever you log in you can see it accumulating

[04-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Let me check in a few minutes..

[04-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Be right back

[04-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you will see a green box below your balance

[04-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it says "claim now"

[04-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Sweet..

[04-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[04-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> today was actually a big day for kmd

[04-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> apparently there is a big wall buyer around of 100btc

[04-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so it looks like u got in at a good time

[04-Sep-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agama is a multi-wallet

[04-Sep-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if you have other coins you can put them in there also...all with the same key

[04-Sep-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> some of the other kmd ecosystem coins actuallyhave the same address. but if you send or buy chainzilla for instance and use the same address they hit the appropriate wallet...

[04-Sep-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just so u know

[04-Sep-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
