[17-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Only mode to be in

[17-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Go hard or go home

[17-Jul-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> true saying

[17-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Go hard...or she'll find someone who will

[17-Jul-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Freezing here now the sun's gone down

[17-Jul-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good morning

[17-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Morning  @SwimedDragon

[17-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Wake up fresh

[17-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Nah, I was sweating because my son turned the air fan off

[17-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I need to take a shower

[17-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Probably gonna set it on cold üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Better hot than cold I reckon

[17-Jul-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I rather have it the other way around. Cold has less annoying spiders, flies, mosquitos and other annoying flying beasts, and it's easier to keep warm then to stay cold.

[17-Jul-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not the winter cold, but just around 10 celcius

[17-Jul-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> 10dgrees in cold

[17-Jul-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'd prefer 30 degrees Celsius

[17-Jul-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Where do you live?

[17-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Max tempature here is mostly around 32, so it's obvious that I don't prefer that haha

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> It's winter now and cold...like 10 degrees

[17-Jul-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> 32 sounds pretty good

[17-Jul-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Thanks @!!!üëæ üëΩ Thorth üëΩ üëæ!!!  üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, 10 degrees is as cold as it gets on avarage there?

[17-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Because here it can go between -1 to -8 in winters during the night and sometimes day

[17-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jul-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Max should be around 23-24 so it's a nice day within these warmer ones

[17-Jul-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I like your winter, you like my summer üòÉ

[17-Jul-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Haha...I'd like to follow summer around the world if I could

[17-Jul-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> So I'd never have to be in winter

[17-Jul-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> The girls would always be wearing less

[17-Jul-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> The scenery always more appealing

[17-Jul-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jul-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In fact, almost all music is grand. One of the most versatile instruments in any genre is the piano I think

[17-Jul-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Hey, how is the land hunting coming along in PR?

[17-Jul-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Do you know Siu from KMD? He lives in PR as well I think

[17-Jul-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its interesting because the same for me however, I'm sure that anyone thathasnt heard it before just see's it as a powerful statement

[17-Jul-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, siu is a top bloke. Rode in the car with him to see dome beach in rincon

[17-Jul-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Not a scratch on the dome building, still stands after many years. was a nuclear facility.

[17-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When we were in PR in May we scouted land to have an idea, we are still looking for the right spot to begin the first project. The first project will be a major milestone for blockchain and helping change the status quo, we want to make sure we do this right.

[17-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Interesting ü§î

[17-Jul-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If you have a nuclear facility (decommissioned I believe) you want to ensure it's protected from the elements. What better way than a dome?

[17-Jul-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
