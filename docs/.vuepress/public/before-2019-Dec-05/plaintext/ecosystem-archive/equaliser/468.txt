[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hey hey. Uneventful day here but a lot is coming soon!

[06-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> sounds good

[06-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> lots in the pipeline

[06-Oct-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s getting there. I’ve made enough this week to do some stuff, but still have a long way to go.

[06-Oct-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> do you mean made enough blocks? or $

[06-Oct-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> $$$

[06-Oct-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Blocks will have to cure 3 weeks minimum

[06-Oct-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Waiting on fibers to get in so I can compare notes against blocks without

[06-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> will it need an engineers 'rating'?

[06-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> like a core sample which they run tests on

[06-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah. Even if it didn’t, I want one. They’ll test a core sample for compression and tensile strength

[06-Oct-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But once we have engineer approval, we are green light go on production

[06-Oct-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Cool, that'll be a day to celebrate

[06-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s just a step by step process

[06-Oct-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Good thing we have such a hustler leading EQLI, @CowboyCrypto- Founder makes things happen 👍

[07-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s a constant grind.

[07-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But one day it’ll be assignment of jobs instead of having to do them all myself

[07-Oct-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m stoked though.

[dscrdeql] <javadth> komodo wallet supports eqli ?

[07-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @javadth yes I use Agama very nice

[07-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> the wallet address is same as KMD address ?

[07-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> whats the sending fees in agma wallet ?

[07-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> if i wanna to send eqli what should i pay ? kmd or eqli ?

[07-Oct-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Fees are quite low

[07-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> if i wanna to send eqli what should i pay ? kmd or eqli ?
what do you mean?

[07-Oct-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <javadth> what coins are using for fee in eqli send ?

[07-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> to buy eqli you need to have btc  and the only exchange that you can do that atm is exrates.com

[07-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> or you have otc channel where you can trade  kmd or btc and buy eqli.

[07-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I think those are the only options available atm

[07-Oct-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @javadth when withdrawing a very small fee of eqli is paid you don't need kmd for fees it's not like Ethereum if that was what you were asking

[07-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adhy1305_CG> night all..

[07-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
