[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Morning link!

[09-Jul-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> How goes it

[09-Jul-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Anyone can use EQLI to purchase a home to build, we dont discriminate. Just some background info, in Australia, the deposit just to get a mortgage is between 10-20% and house prices vary up to almost $1M depending on hosehold income such as 2 adult incomes that pass the test to be loaned that amount. For a half decent home 2-3 bedroom about 400k to 600k. It is difficult to find one for less than 300k. That being said, i have for the past half decade have been insisting that house prices are becoming extremely inflated and mortgage stress and household debt will become too much for the economy to bear and will have a negative effect for everyone. The banks have also been lending out more in mortgages than people are able to service. Politicians own collectively $370M in investment property and people are allowed to hoard multiple properties using an interest only mortgage and a tax benefit that was brought in during the 80's when interest rates were above 10% The tax benefit was to stimulate housing investment to in turn stimulate building and jobs in construction. Now that many countries and Australia have the lowest rates in history, the tax benefit is out dated and is detrimental to the broader economy. The tax benefit allows property investors to claim losses against an investment property to pay less income tax and also reduces government income to put towards the economy, infrastructure, job incentives schemes, etc and with the ratio of  first home buyers dropping, not just in australia, but developed countries too. And I havent even mentioned the increasing number of people falling below the poverty line. In the 21st century, the middle class is shrinking.

[09-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We are very passionate about this and know that results will speak for themsleves after our first project, our customer base will grow so we can expand and start being part of change of decentralised housing markets

[09-Jul-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Boosting jobs in local communities, creating more jobs for designers because skills shortages in construction are increasing, everyone wants to work with technology and not many want to do hard work any more in my view

[09-Jul-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> All sounds interesting

[09-Jul-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I know houses are expensive, I only earn about 10% yearly from what a house here costs

[09-Jul-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Also Australian banks are under investigation for fraud, collusion, malpractice and bad conduct

[09-Jul-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there a reason why you start overseas?

[09-Jul-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is the ground to expensive?

[09-Jul-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ??

[09-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The houses we will build are suited for many climates and regions, Puerto Rico is still recovering from hurricane Marina from september last year so if you know what our mission is, is to build strong, affordable, beautiful homes that are also hurricane resistant and wild fire resistant with different designs sizes and techniques. Like I metioned above, people like results, not hype.

[09-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It takes a while to type, sorry lol

[09-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> hmmmm

[09-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Nice

[09-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i encourage you to read the conversations above üëç

[09-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Who gets first in line for these houses in Puerto Rico?

[09-Jul-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, obviously the poor people need them, but how can they afford it at this stage?

[09-Jul-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Who ever wants to buy them, There has been interest. Also the roadmap will explain https://equaliser.org/index.php/roadmap

Roadmap

[09-Jul-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Let's say you have a rich family, and a poor family that both want the only house that's been build. How can the poor family buy the house?

[09-Jul-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or is it build seperate? Like 10 houses for who-ever wants it and 10 houses for who needs it.

[09-Jul-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not sure if I completely understand what I read (English is my 2nd language) so sorry if that's on my side.

[09-Jul-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Mattycoz> Sounds really interesting

[09-Jul-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> may god help them

[09-Jul-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the house is commissioned to be built by the purchase in EQLI which contains the smart contract and proof of purchase title. there is no competition between rich and poor. its not like an auction where clearly the rich person is going to win. like i said, it's non-discriminative   üëå

[09-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> @AndronicusBass-Founder  its good

[09-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We planned Equaliser to be just that. Equaliser of the field üòâ üëå

[09-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I love the plan

[09-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Roadmap!

[09-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> But poor can't afford to buy crypto

[09-Jul-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But how is a poor familiy going to be able to afford a cheap house?

[09-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Or home

[09-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> People on low incomes that are still able to get a mortgage have scrimped and saved and reduced quality of living to save enough for a deposit for a mortgage, As I mentioned above, a deposit for a mortgage is 10-20% so rather than entering into a mortgage, they can own an equaliser home. We also will cater to people that can afford to buy but still want to save money and a percentage of profits will go towards helping less fortunate and assisting people in times of natural disasters.

[09-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> of course we cant help every single person in the world but hope that we can stimulate change as we show another reason blockchain can help human necessity instead of many other blockchain projects that cater for human desire and want, i hope you understand what i mean?

[09-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I'm starting to get it better now, thanks for answering those questions üòÉ

[09-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i think biggest problem for many of us would be land

[09-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> land is so expensive in aus üò¶

[09-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and it's interesting because @MySoulisNotForSale showed me a video the other day about how we could fit the worlds population in a small area if we really wanted too lol

[09-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> so all this "running out of land" is just a load of bs

[09-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and another problem is everyone wants to live in certain areas... and all this land goes to waste

[09-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Someone mentioned to me recently you could fit the earths population in 1 particular U.S state, i forgot which one.
