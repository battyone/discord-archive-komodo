[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, I would enjoy the peace and serenity, still nice to have a change of scenery

[14-Aug-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> around here, it's been hot, then really hot, then hotter than that.

[14-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 62.6 f is 17 c. That's not cold 😛

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> specially when it's cold

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, it's a bit below what I like, but it's hoody weather, Not real gear.

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> domes look like boobs

[14-Aug-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lmao

[14-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Only if there's two close together

[14-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> especially if one's your house and the other your shop... side by side...

[14-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> jelly beat me to the enter key...

[14-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Maybe silicon domes would be resilient

[14-Aug-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Just bend with the weather

[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Oy 😛

[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> so... converted to C for you guys, this is the typical temp in midwinter here: -12.2222

[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Should patent that

[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That is cold.

[14-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Wouldn't hurt a silicon dome

[14-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It might 😛

[14-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> it does ugly things to steel, but not really concrete. Have no idea about silicon.

[14-Aug-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> most of the 'users' in exrates chat box fail the turing test.
