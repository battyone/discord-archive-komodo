[15-Aug-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> not much action on the price

[15-Aug-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> but that's good in this day

[15-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, lots of other coins are down, but I expect EQLI to rise when lots of people join in and invite others
