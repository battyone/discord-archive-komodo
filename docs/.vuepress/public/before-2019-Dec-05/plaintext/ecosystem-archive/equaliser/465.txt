[23-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm going to see if I can work out a deal with some of my old contacts

[23-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> sickening they charge so much just to screw everyone over for their own greed as it seems

[23-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I paid almost 26k for that listing lol

[23-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Top 30 seemed to follow nicely

[23-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> wow 26k

[23-Sep-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Sep-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> We can get o twitter and tweet asking people to wthdraw from exrates

[23-Sep-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Wtf

[23-Sep-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> nuts right?

[23-Sep-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> That's more than i make a year

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> way more than i make a year lol

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Lol

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yup. Hitbtc starts at 40btc but I‚Äôve talked them down as low as 10 before

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> dont use them either

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> did you see what happened to APR?

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hell no lol

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lool its nearly half of what I make which is ridiuculous.

[23-Sep-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> hitbtc is a better exchange than exrates but well

[23-Sep-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I never liked exrates in the first place since they froze my account with no reasons lol.

[23-Sep-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> hitBTC took APR Coin's deposit and the 10k coins and then dumped those and the rewards from staking almost immediately upon listing them because they "didn't stake as many coins as they expected" so they dumped them to get the BTC they wanted out of it

[23-Sep-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> and APR hasn't recovered since still

[23-Sep-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm looking way down at the other end of the spectrum

[23-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Crex24, litebit, trade satoshi, stocks exchange,

[23-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> love crex24

[23-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> a little slow to load for me sometimes, but is a good newer exchange for sure

[23-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ya TS runs on raspberry pi not quite safe but the others they seem a good option for sure xD

[23-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Cryptopia seems for me, a descent exchange to buy coins. I've been using it for a while now, never had any problems

[23-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Is it unreasonable to assume all these exchanges are incohutes with eachother?

[23-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nah they aren‚Äôt

[23-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> problem with cryptopia is it is hella expensive to list

[23-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Each exchange does their own thing

[23-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I messaged Alan booth last night, he‚Äôs the ceo

[23-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If cryptopia

[23-Sep-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If there‚Äôs a shot to get us there that‚Äôs the way on

[23-Sep-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smoky Satoshi> Never had issue with cryptopia

[23-Sep-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> cryptopia seems like a fair exchange to be listed I woul say so,

[23-Sep-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did but it was because of our teams actions

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Cryptopia is gonna cost us around 8-13 btc

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> whats that üòÑ

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Or 5 million DoT coin

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> tbh I would prefer you spend that money in the project funding..

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> rather that ec

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> How much is 5m DoT coin?

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> exchange listing*

[23-Sep-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm focused on building

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But I need somewhere for you all to trade as well

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> obviously and exrates isn't an option right now.

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> or ever

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lol

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Honestly these are living changing funds just for listing. It's amazing  how they charge such huge amounts and late dump on you again

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> @SwimedDragon people can sell the DOT however much they want, so really depends on market price

[23-Sep-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think a descent exchange will be good to also get new people involved. But yeah those listing fee's are annoying to handle with

[23-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> but like cowboy said, easily 8-13 BTC or more depending

[23-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm about to go to my desk. I‚Äôll figure something out

[23-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I agree altough those fees are ridiculous.

[23-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> yup they are

[23-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> they take so much advatange thats the problem.

[23-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm going to get creative and hopefully rock out a decent listing or two

[23-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I trust you!
You do know that

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> You must be a very creative dude.. haha üëçüèª

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If the prototype gets build, ask people for a small donation to stay the night in there üòÇ

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> we got your back cowboy!

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ahahah üòÑ

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I do trust him too

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just making a joke haha üòÉ

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve done more with much less lol

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> The fact that you are as straightforward about everything instead of covering it up makes all the difference!

[23-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm here for the ride with you lol

[23-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye you are not shady and are open foward that makes the difference.

[23-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Truth be told I know of one person who has more invested in this than I do

[23-Sep-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> well hes a big bag holder thats fore sure üòÑ

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> quite a heavy bag I would say

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I put 10s of 1000s in this to get it going

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Of my own money

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i believe it man

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I must say I think that a new exchange will be good for people to buy and sell, and can get more people in, but I have no doubt that most of us will not sell anyway

[23-Sep-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep thats a lot of money

[23-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I don‚Äôt even have $2k in üòï

[23-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea neither do I

[23-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> this thing at ICO price was about 50 cents

[23-Sep-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> so you go figure üòÉ

[23-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That‚Äôs ok it doesn‚Äôt matter who has how much in it. We are all here

[23-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm gonna get down to my office in a min

[23-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> you could buy a lot more coins now that at ICO price even if it was much less.

[23-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but we are all here for the long run..

[23-Sep-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You guys hit me with some ideas

[23-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> who cares about ICO prices.

[23-Sep-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> I missed the DoT coins thing... Could someone tldr it for me?
