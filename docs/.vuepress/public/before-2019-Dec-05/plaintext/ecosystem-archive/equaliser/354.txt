[20-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's damn near free now, man!

[20-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I thought I was greedy...

[20-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> nice morning for a nice coffee

[20-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I gotta go to work soon though

[20-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> boohoo

[20-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'll be stuck with just my mobile

[20-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> which is excrutiating sometimes to 'chat' with

[20-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> autocorrect does an abissimal job

[20-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> and probably an abysmal one too ðŸ˜„

[20-Aug-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Good morning @ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯

[20-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I turned off autocorrect. I went to the nationals in the 84 spelling bee, I got this ðŸ˜„

[20-Aug-18 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> i think autocorrect is for when you press the wrong letter

[20-Aug-18 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it changes my words completely lots of times

[20-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I think that might have something to do with the swype 'keyboard' on the android phone

[20-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'll swipe for a word and then see later that a completely different word is showing

[20-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it can be very frustrating

[20-Aug-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> especially when wanting to givec a quick response

[20-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> to havce to go adn fix it up all the time

[20-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> autocorrect exists to have a scapegoat. It has no other purpose.

[20-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> haha.....maybe

[20-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm off ot work now

[20-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I base this on the number of times it's correct. In my experience, you'd get more accurate results with dice.

[21-Aug-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> froa dumper to work there is also the dumpee

[21-Aug-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> She was trying to tell one of her friends something about her friends deceased husband and it came out to "how is Steven doing?"
And her friend was like....uhhhh...dead Luanne, he's still dead ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> â˜•

[21-Aug-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> More caffeine required

[21-Aug-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Must...have....more

[21-Aug-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> B12 @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ

[21-Aug-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> works wonder for me ðŸ˜ƒ

[21-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Yea..maybe vitamin s as well

[21-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Vitamins only give a boost if you're deficient in that area

[21-Aug-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> But maybe most ppl are deficient in B12 which is why it works

[21-Aug-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> My gf is but I'm not, it's one of the few vitamins the body doesn't produce naturally

[21-Aug-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> How can the body get it, other than vitamin s?

[21-Aug-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Our you're saying it can't

[21-Aug-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Food

[21-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> It's created when the body processes food, hence the energy ðŸ˜ƒ

[21-Aug-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> So eating enough food will give it to the body

[21-Aug-18 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Through normal diet yet but the supplements wake you up without the caffeine crash

[21-Aug-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> i'm confused by that doge question lol

[21-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Other than you can buy 2.7 mil doge for one btc? lol

[21-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> not as confused as you will be if you head over to #trivia . first person to get the right answer gets 5 EQLI

[21-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Doge is my savings account

[21-Aug-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I always buy a million doge below 20 sats

[21-Aug-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Then sell when it pops. Makes me a great living
