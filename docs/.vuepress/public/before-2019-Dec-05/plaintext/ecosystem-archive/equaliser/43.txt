[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Hi

[07-Jul-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> I am trying to buy btc from coinbase with BofA credit but its not going through. Any suggestions where I can  have access to buy btc with bofA credit card

[07-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I don’t think they take CC anymore

[07-Jul-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Ok russia didn't lose lol

[07-Jul-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Bank of America banned purchase of Cryptos a few months back.

[07-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Bad. So I can issue bofa card for cryptos anymore

[07-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Probably not.

[07-Jul-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They may have reversed themselves on that, but I would think not. They made headlines in February for being one of several major banks to (again) tell their 'customers' what they may or may not spend their money on.

[07-Jul-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Reason why crypto is here to stay forever

[07-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Thank you for the info

[07-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That’s why I love crypto

[07-Jul-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> USA didn’t even qualify

[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> If that helps you

[07-Jul-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ArthurSk12> I know

[07-Jul-18 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ArthurSk12> To be fair, USA isn't too much into football are you guys?

[07-Jul-18 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Not really

[07-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I’m into video games and music lol I don’t watch sports I play them

[07-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Play them on computer?

[07-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> No

[07-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> computer games are easiest way to play games

[07-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> In real life

[07-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jul-18 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> only sold in Australia I believe

[07-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> my son bought it

[07-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> he like it much though..too easy

[07-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> he plays real AFL though so maybe there correlation between real and computer game wasnt there

[07-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> for him anyway
