[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You are free to offer yours for sale at whatever price you wish on barterdex

[10-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We removed ours for sale.

[10-Jul-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You can still trade it however you wish.

[10-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <DaylightHours> Why

[10-Jul-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jul-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs a free market

[10-Jul-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I certainly hope so, but price is one thing I try to stay away from.

[10-Jul-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh I couldn‚Äôt tell you. I pay very little attention to it because all I see is crazy bs designed to divide ppl. F that. I‚Äôm trying to make life easier not harder.

[10-Jul-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Yep..politics can be a deep black hole

[10-Jul-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Best to just avoid it altogether

[10-Jul-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[10-Jul-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I think most governments want housing for their population, so wouldn't expect you'd come across too many roadblocks

[10-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I liked the house designs
