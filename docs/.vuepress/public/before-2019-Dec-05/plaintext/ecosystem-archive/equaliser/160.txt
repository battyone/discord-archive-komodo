[23-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah

[23-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> most were saying they are just very slow and poor layout to website others were saying they couldn't withdraw at all

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If I dont respond, I'll have probably fallen asleep, had about 2 hours in the last 36 or so hours. Mind has been too active havent been tired lol. bad sleeping habbits all round haha

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its not a very good exchange.. but the positives are they been around for a while and respond to people very quickly but i would not suggest sending large sums there

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @AndronicusBass-Founder  get some sleep üòÉ

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> make sure you check announcements, new one in there

[23-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> the problem with taking those reviews seriously is a lot of people make the negative review while waiting on a withdrawal and probably never go back and correct it

[23-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @linkara6669 yhe

[23-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Many exchanges do have mixed reviews and more bad than good however, majority of people seem to be fine. Its pot luck sometimes with experiences with exchanges unfortunately
