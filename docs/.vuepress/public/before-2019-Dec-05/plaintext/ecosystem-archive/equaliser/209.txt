[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Still managed to build it up decent

[27-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and charlie lee liquidates at the highs

[27-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But they went to shit when we all left

[27-Jul-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I actually offered them this idea first as a use case

[27-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They declined so we moved on it

[27-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I love komodo

[27-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wrote that in September

[27-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 💯

[27-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> 🤟

[27-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I truly believe kmd is better than ethereum

[27-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Etherium couldn't handle mass adoption

[27-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> howd u derive the final tgt?

[27-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I based it on the announcement of tech (bdex, monaize, atomic swaps, overtaking eth and watching that money flow into kmd)

[27-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Kmd and eth are very close in supply

[27-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> fair enuf

[27-Jul-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> good evening

[27-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> I buy Komodo, there is a very good price 😃

[27-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> Evening  @cypherzero

[27-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Komodo ahead of the development for several years

[27-Jul-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah but not user friendly

[27-Jul-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> they need to concentrate on being more user friendly

[27-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I used to say that about them too.

[27-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> For convenience, users pay something else

[27-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and it is not for a newb at all...

[27-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats why it hasn't taken off yet

[27-Jul-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but I think once, they finalize the technology end of it, then they can simplify it on the front end to make it more user friendly.

[27-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and then you will see it take off

[27-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> from the tech side i have only heard good things

[27-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and to quote my buddy mocho, I have a bag!

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ever last seems to have gone down hill especially in australia

[27-Jul-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> One year ago I posted that.

[27-Jul-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that was when I created homecoin on waves

[27-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[27-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> which essentially is what became this project

[27-Jul-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> lol Nice

[27-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Ok, bought a small bit on exrates

[27-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Lets hope the withdraw doesnt take too long 😄

[27-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> total fee is not nice though 😢

[27-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Total fee to withdraw almost as much as the amount of EQL I had first hahaha

[27-Jul-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> .5 exchange fee and .5 merchant fee

[27-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Entering that into my blockfolio is going to fux it up though 😄

[27-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah withdrawals are way too high

[27-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> What should be a correct price for eql actually?

[27-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> I mean buying it on exrates now even is a 10x with a price of 0,01$

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 1000 sats at the lowest dump was my thought

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 3000 sats if we were goin on the last sold price of the sale

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 3,5M EQL left under 1000 sats?

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> not sure

[27-Jul-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i havent looked

[27-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That's what I see at a glance

[27-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> +4000% with the price on barterdex according to blockfolio 😄

[27-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 4.7 m

[27-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I'm gonna download blockfolio now just wanna dream a little lol

[27-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exrates uses 9 spots instead of 8

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So the price of 89

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Which is lowest left

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 8.9 sats

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> is 89 sats?

[27-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Ahaaa
