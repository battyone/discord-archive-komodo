[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> True that

[20-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's a warm spring day today in Sydney

[20-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I mowed the lawn this morning...hadn't done it in about 2 months

[20-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Today is the first day we haven't had rain in 2-3 weeks

[20-Oct-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm sitting in a stifling hot dojo as my son does his jujitsu grading

[20-Oct-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> dang, must be humid as. Hopefully the water supply is topped up

[20-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Humid af

[20-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> What belt is he jelly?

[20-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Brazilian jiu jitsu?

[20-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hot gyms are where champions are made

[20-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Air conditioned gyms make ppl dependent on comfort lol

[20-Oct-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it's called Quantum Martial Arts

[20-Oct-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> they teach the Northstar Ju Jitsu system

[20-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> he got his Blue belt... he's been doing it for a year now. so not half way yet to black.  He'll have another few years to go

[20-Oct-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> but he's very light on his feet and quick.  Although he's only 11 years old

[20-Oct-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea I agree about the hot gyms. So many gymns are airconditioned and ppl whine like little bitches if they raise too much of a sweat.

[20-Oct-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> When I work out it's downstairs from the house so it's outside, it's cold as in winter and hot af in summer. I have to wear full length pants and shirt because there are mingies....like little mosquitoes that bite me and I seem to be allergic to and come up in big welts. So I wear full length tracksuit pants and long sleeve tshirt even on hottest days in summer. I sweat a bucket load.

[20-Oct-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> anyways, good to get home.... make myself some tea..

[20-Oct-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I just put a roast pork leg in the oven.  fully salted for the crunchiest crackle in the world.  it'll take 2.5 hours to cook.

[20-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'd like steak and lobster for 4 people as well.  I reckon I could eat most of it myself as well.

[20-Oct-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Love steak and lobster so why not have them in the same meal....sounds like a good idea.

[20-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763

Last year January 2017 if u invested $1000 in #bitcoin you would have made $15,000 
And if you invested at the same $1000 in $ltc you would have made $50,000
My question is:
Which project/s will make you more profits?

[21-Oct-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just a fast update here from me: Im currently working on getting more funds raised us so that we can do a few things to improve our situation. Everything I've done the past few weeks has worked well and I will continue to grind everyday to make this work out.

[21-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> L @CowboyCrypto hey there

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[21-Oct-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm on my third...at work now

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol Im grinding away trying to put us in a better position.

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Doing AML training

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> hoping I can accomplish a few things this week and get rocking.

[21-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @CowboyCrypto I'm glad you're on the case

[21-Oct-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think it'll help when building is being done. Ppl will see the results, and see progress..

[21-Oct-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But like most building processes, they start off slow as there's a lot of groundwork to do before construction starts

[21-Oct-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there's a ton of work for sure

[21-Oct-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The thing is that you almost need one person concentrating on raising funds. Another concentrating purely on PR and marketing. Another on building and materials and design. And a 4th on the blockchain and changes required.

[22-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <K00l1> Good morning
