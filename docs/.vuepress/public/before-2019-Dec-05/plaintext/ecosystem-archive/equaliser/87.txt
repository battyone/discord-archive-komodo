[11-Jul-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> @jellysmash  you made your own crypto trading bot?

[11-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I wrote a buy bot once

[11-Jul-18 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> To keep the order on top

[11-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> There was a good difference in the price of the coin compared to other exchanges

[11-Jul-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> So, my bot kept the order on top to buy at least a 1000 sats lower than other exchanges

[11-Jul-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I used to sell manually on other exchanges later

[11-Jul-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Made some $500 in a month doing that

[11-Jul-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> The volume was pretty low though

[11-Jul-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
