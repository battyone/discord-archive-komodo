[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, Spydr, it is.

[19-Aug-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Just a little frustrating when things take forever üòÑ

[19-Aug-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i like the sound of all tihs...moving faster, KMD enhancements, etc

[dscrdeql] <spydr> Wow. The response. Really y'all?

[19-Aug-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But that's the nature of things. If life kicks you in the teeth, punch it! üòÑ

[19-Aug-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> @Biomech Yes, and trying to keep up with the tech changes is a complete other project. We know how devs love to hear "that's great, but since you took so long we need to integrate xyz to keep competitive"

[19-Aug-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Hell yeah @Biomech-Founder üëç

[19-Aug-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Aug-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> a spydr, yes, but not a spider üòÑ

[19-Aug-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <adriana> I smashed it a bit but just to hold it

[19-Aug-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yer a bit late to our lore here. Old timers know I once shot a black widow with a beretta üòÑ

[19-Aug-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And I'd do it again.

[dscrdeql] <spydr> Wow. Taking overkill literally. Hope it wasn't in the house

[19-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> no, only about 4 feet.

[19-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It was in North Highlands, California. And no, it was not overkill.

[19-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> You could still identify the body.

[19-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Fuckin' monster was about the size of a softball.

[19-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Aug-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No it wasn't in the house. A workshop that hadn't been used in a while. My dad rented it, we were cleaning up. That monster dropped out of the rafters and reflexes and training took over.

[19-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> training...military @Biomech-Founder ?

[19-Aug-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If we go to the stars and Meet a race of intelligent spiders, I am the wrong man to make first contact.

[19-Aug-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, not military. IPSCA.
