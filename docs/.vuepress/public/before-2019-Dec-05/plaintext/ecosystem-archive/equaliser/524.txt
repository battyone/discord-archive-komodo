[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Luckily today I got stuck behind a very slow driver.  luckily because the 90 degree corner I normally go around at 40 km per hour had rain water on the road up to axle level. If I had of been going my normal speed I would have come off for sure.  Luckily I had some patience this morning.

[dscrdeql] <c2k> if BTC can get a lil more mojo i have a feeling those small EQLI sellers will either disappear or get bought. then EQLI price is going to explode

[dscrdeql] <Tio Obi-Juan Kenobiüññ> @c2k but i need more information than btc rising. What is the overall goal of this project? Is it realistic? Why should i buy alot and hold?

[28-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> have u read the whitepaper or been to the website?

[28-Nov-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> their vision is explained well there

[28-Nov-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> plus rewards contracts are coming soon. that will be huge

[28-Nov-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the rewards contract will be similar to masternodes but without havving to run a node

[28-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> The beauty of this structure is you don‚Äôt have to worry about running multiple nodes on a server, as you would traditionally. 
The rewards will pay out in specified percentages based on the amount of time you choose for your Reward contract. 
There has been talk of APR Rates of 10% - 35% depending on the terms which should be around 90 - 700 day terms . And these rewards will come from a designated wallet which has already funded with EQLI.

[28-Nov-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Tio Obi-Juan Kenobiüññ

[28-Nov-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> Thats the monetary side. then there is the humanitarian side...building structurally sound and durable homes in areas that are adversely affected by weather. the EQLI homes bad weather resistant (hurricane, fire, etc) for different reasons.

[28-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> Homes can be purchased with EQLI 
But if purchased with BTC (for example) the proceeds will be reinvested in EQLI...ie purchasing EQLI on an exchange using the  BTC.
