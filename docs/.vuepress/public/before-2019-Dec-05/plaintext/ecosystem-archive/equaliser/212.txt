[dscrdeql] <Llama> Does anyone have any recommendations for what I should major in?

[27-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I'm on moderators. Thnks so much

[27-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> my 2c

[27-Jul-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Yup agree

[27-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> figure out what your passion is. Learn how to monetize it. Get the paper that makes that work, but don't put too much weight to it.

[27-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @c2k  - stress reducer - my withdrawal today took 8hrs including maintenance window where they tools the site down  !!

[27-Jul-18 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> eek

[27-Jul-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> mine says "on posting" under the status column

[27-Jul-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> from there it's just till they get to it.

[27-Jul-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Yeah - don‚Äôt look at it!!! and go enjoy the weekend starting !! It will be there tomorrow

[27-Jul-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ok good. wsa tempted to buy the 1mm offered at 0.00000009 üòú

[27-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but opted to buy less so if they mess it up i dont get pissed

[27-Jul-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Yep - test small first

[27-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> To withdraw from exrates, you hit the red output button?

[27-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes

[27-Jul-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but u have to create a finance password if u didnt already create one. otherwise you wont be able to send out

[27-Jul-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've had no issues other than time with withdraw, and I've moved a LOT of coins.

[27-Jul-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Hmmm...ok

[27-Jul-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @Llama with your thought process, i would say major in marketing. Social Media.

[27-Jul-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You could do some awesome things in that space

[27-Jul-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and make a ton of money along with it

[27-Jul-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @Biomech-Founder  re  xrates.me - The  screens and language is odd and didn‚Äôt find it easy to use but got there in the end and it all worked !! Thanks for pointing me there yesterday.  üëçüèæ

[27-Jul-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> I was thinking finance or economics.

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Hi, is the team going to publish a summary of how the ICO went? Details about how much money was raised and how many were sold?

[27-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We announced total sold on twitter, just north of 49 million coins.

[27-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that was private sales and dICO

[27-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Wow

[27-Jul-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> value has since dropped dramatically

[27-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Makes my 250 look like chump change

[27-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Ive noticed just picked up a good amount. Thanks for the information. Where did the other coins allocated towards the ICO go?

[27-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> in the money we raised.

[27-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that will be announced soon

[27-Jul-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but a direct answer is they will be used to fund our masternode rewards.

[27-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
