[08-Jul-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @CombatWombat fish and chips rock. When chips are cooked in animal fat is the tastiest

[08-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah tastiest but not very healthy lol

[08-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ðŸ˜¬

[08-Jul-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The way I see it is that chips are not healthy in general regardless what they say about the oil type but If i have them in moderation, I want them to taste damn good lol.

[08-Jul-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> chips are healthy they are from the ground it's like the only vegetable i eat don't ruin it for me please

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> seriously lets get out twitter presence up we can do it ðŸ’ª

[08-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @jellysmash nice. I have had it since 2014 but never used it until this year.

[08-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> twitter is good to spread crypto info

[08-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> as long as they don't flag you as a bot

[08-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[08-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> same with mine, I've had it for about 6 years and only just cranked it up this year for crypto

[08-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'm not a 'Shane Warne' kind of guy

[08-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Organic marketing is respectful albeit slightly slower, there is more quality.

[08-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it's all about quality

[08-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> quality will last through time

[08-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> as will the homes and buildings we build

[08-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i honestly don't even know how i got 200 followers

[08-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[08-Jul-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> In Russian threads, there are instructions on increasing the number of subscribers to Twitter and Facebook.

[08-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Possible they talk about bots or fake accounts, we dont want any of that. When we have our first project built, that will be the ultimate marketing and talk of the town ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't have any twitter, if needed I use my gf's twitter

[08-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I don't spam the account publicly

[08-Jul-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> good call, otherwise you might be sleeping on the couch if you do lol

[08-Jul-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> My dad taught himself to speak russian so I will probably go with him

[08-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> interesting choice of language to learn

[08-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'm not really into learning languages

[08-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> in fact I'm pretty terrible at them

[08-Jul-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I just don't seem to hear the nuances of them

[08-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ‘½ Thorth ðŸ‘½ ðŸ‘¾!!!> ???

[08-Jul-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i speak 2 languages would love to learn Russian but I find languages hard to learn now

[08-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Russian is much harder than English

[08-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> There is an application of Duolingo on Android

[08-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> But the most difficult thing is grammar

[08-Jul-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't think I've got the patience to learn a new language

[08-Jul-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only languages I know are Dutch and English

[08-Jul-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I could understand bits and parts if people speak German, but that's it

[08-Jul-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Arabic and English only here

[08-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> learning another language is hard, lots of patience. Also we still offer bounties for white paper translations in other languages

[08-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i can only speak Arabic can't read or write it unfortunately

[08-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> ahh, writing and phonetic sounding is different. yeah i get ya
