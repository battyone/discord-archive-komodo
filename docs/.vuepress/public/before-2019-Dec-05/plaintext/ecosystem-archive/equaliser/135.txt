[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> so, I still am unable to get exrates to send me 2 factor auth

[20-Jul-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> some phone number fields require the country code and you have to omit the very first number of your number

[20-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> why does this exchange have . digits instead of 8?

[20-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> 9

[20-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm working on stuff, Its mundane but has to be done

[20-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I mean, how can that be the price? I thought iwas around 20 -50 cents

[20-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Something isnt right. Just waiting for wallet's to be available for withdraw. Like I said, Im not a trader so I dont know prices and satoshis.

[20-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> where the hell is cowboy

[20-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I mean, I wanna pick up $200 worth but the price seems off to me

[20-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Still no withdraw of EQLI from exrates?

[20-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Something is not right so we are waiting for withdraw to become available. this could be affecting the price.

[20-Jul-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think they do things manually so could be a delay. Thought I read that somewhere
