[12-Nov-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @NWhiskeyTango hi there

[12-Nov-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yep some good stuff

[12-Nov-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'm so glad we got in early on equaliser

[12-Nov-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ya im sorry about your exrates experience. Wish i could have grabbed more

[12-Nov-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Well, that's behind us now...moving forward well be listed on stex

[12-Nov-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> And raisex?

[12-Nov-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I'd still use Exrates as well, I'd just withdraw after buying

[12-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Haven't heard yet about raisex

[12-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Still waiting

[12-Nov-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I hope it goes ahead, and wasn't just a ploy for raisex to get a few more ppl onto their exchange.

[12-Nov-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I sent them a message on twitter and they said it is planned. I dunno when though

[12-Nov-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, hope it goes ahead soonish.

[12-Nov-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Cool. I'll be on the lookout for stex too. I never realized how long these exchange listings took. At least a quality exchange lol

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't like Raisex

[12-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They had a register promo that you would get 0.02 ETH

[12-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They didn't pay out because my account was considered ''new'', but other people that have accounts over a year old plus a descent amount of followers, also didn't got any payment.

[12-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> When I asked Raisex they told me to wait and stop asking, else they wouldn't pay me out.
I went on and asked again because in the meantime, they were ''paying out'' other people for newer promo's. I accused them of not paying out and they blocked me on twitter :facepalm:

[12-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So if you're going to use Raisex, I advice to be carefull. If they fake or don't even pay out their promo's, I wouldn't trust my funds on there

[12-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Doesn't Tipsy block invite links on discord? Maybe that can be done on tg too?
