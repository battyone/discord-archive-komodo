[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've only sold enough to get my investment back

[15-Nov-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Oh well.

[15-Nov-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah I know, and I do feel bad on it if I have to be honest, but I just wanted to be sure to get this investment back, isn't really that much but still. I've lost money on holding other coins, lost coins on staking website hack, so I hope people understand it also.

[15-Nov-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No worries

[15-Nov-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto can you please check DM

[15-Nov-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did

[15-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> here the best play currently is to let me do what I do and hold on to what you have in terms of coins. We‚Äôve not even officially launched so dumping the coins into the walls I built only hurts our progress. In terms of where I feel we should be, I think 1500 sat range is where we should be at minimum. Do what you will with this info

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Hi

[15-Nov-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <blackstone1> Unfortunately there are always people who have no vision. Some, not all,  want quick return and will sell off no matter what. Just keep pushing forward is all you can do.  Just my opinion of course

[15-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> How long do deposits typically take?

[15-Nov-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <vErtex2012> morning

[15-Nov-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Congrats on the listing definitely a much better trading platform than exrates. I think if you would publish a blog article outlining the circulating supply as well as where funds from ico are allocated it would help get investors on board. Obviously priority is on building but the blog post would also help promote its scarcity and without a coinmarketcap page it is difficult to find this information.

[15-Nov-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Thank you for the input. I will do that this weekend when I get a few hours

[16-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i still believe in it cowboy.
on exrates i bought all the 49sat EQLI and am bidding fo rmore

[16-Nov-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anyone wants to sell some im there

[16-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I just bought a lot at 79 sats and 86 sats

[16-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i bot some too jells

[16-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once listing announced should run nicely on stex

[16-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yep

[16-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Also, once masternode/crypto conditions are implemented then that will make a difference

[16-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Ppl will need at least 100,000 to participate

[16-Nov-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> 20%-30% is a great reward

[16-Nov-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there are some great projects in komodo ecosystem...and this one is comparable to all of them

[16-Nov-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> most are trading 0.10c - 0.20c range 
so there is no reason this project should be any different, espcially given that there is a real world use for EQLI

[16-Nov-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> anything below 100sats is a steal

[16-Nov-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
