[03-Aug-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There's a gif of a dog in a shop behind the counter that cracks me up every time

[03-Aug-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> interesting about the possibility that smart contract coins like eos and eth will be too slow

[03-Aug-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> our blockchain was made in P.R so we straight off the bat created some work in P.R üòÉ

[03-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> P.R? Have a feeling I'm gonna feel dumb when you tell me lol

[03-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Puerto Rico, you're not the first person to ask what the acronym means, all good.

[03-Aug-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> That was my first guess üòÉ

[03-Aug-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Hmm pr

[03-Aug-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> That can have many meanings lol

[03-Aug-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Puerto Rico. Cool

[03-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> public relations is the first guess

[03-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Yup that's one

[03-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> First guess was Puerto Rico, second was public relations lol

[03-Aug-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Per rectal :D

[03-Aug-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Mainly thought Puerto Rico because of the upcoming work

[03-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Ah cool cool

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> You too @üåüKQweci‚òÑ - nope @Podmaster üòÜ

[03-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Hmm... If eos and ethereum too slow already, will they find ways to speed up?

[03-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Lol coffee to keep you going through the Friday

[03-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ> Most project have realized and are moving away from  the ether blockchain

[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Yeah it's a shame

[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Why was it so slow to begin with? It was interesting how one project like Crypto kitties brought it to a stand still

[03-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> just driving from one venue to the next and back again to pick them up

[03-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> at least I'm glad they get to play lots of sport

[03-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and it's good for them

[03-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and playing team sports is a good experience as well

[03-Aug-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
