[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats amazing.

[24-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I was in reichtag dome a few days ago

[24-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and I was impressed byt the construction.

[24-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> by*

[24-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> honestly if the market would take off and I could stop spending money on the market and rather make money to put into this, then it will go alot faster. But regardless I am going to push this as far as my body will allow me to go.

[24-Nov-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I 100 % agree

[24-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and I think stopping the rains channel was the right thing to do also

[24-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> like @c2k  those selling are way too low and it seems like people are dumping from what they got from the rains.

[24-Nov-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Be sure to take a few good moments of rest in between @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[24-Nov-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is there still volume on exrates?

[24-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> 20 to 60 there, but i was sold 😄 since i can not widraw, the minum wd to higer there, bettwr on the Stex

[24-Nov-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> every day I collect buy cheap but when I want to go to widraw it's not enough lol so i sold out there

[24-Nov-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i think the minimum for withdrawal is 25,000...but not sure

[24-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exrates is a scam.

[24-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> straight up.

[24-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I hate to say it because it was my idea to list there, but they are a bunch of thieves.

[24-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> where did the rain channel go?

[24-Nov-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> yes not yet scam but higer wd there 😄

[24-Nov-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Ok guys I was planning on withdraw the EQLI that I've racked up in rains ect so I have control in my agama wallet but I tried yesterday and today with no luck. The bot command is ? withdraw address amount right?

[24-Nov-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> I tried withdrawing the full amount, full amount minus 1, rounding down to a whole number... nothing would process

[25-Nov-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Nov-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im sure your EQLI are safe somewhere steve

[25-Nov-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @c2k I'm not questioning their safety just confused why it won't withdraw. I'm acquiring more and just like having everything in my control as much as possible.
