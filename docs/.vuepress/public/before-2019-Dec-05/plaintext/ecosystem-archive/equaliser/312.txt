[14-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure if that counts since recently or since you've first joined. I think it's since you joined the channel

[14-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I was alway's referring people to the official website and said the discord link was on there, should use my own now instead haha
