[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I just hope they come out with a solution quickly

[05-Jun-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> atm DP STEX COINEAL bittrex

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> all the exchanges I have my funds

[05-Jun-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> COINEAL? Don't know that one. Should we be aiming for it? Obviously a ways to go before we start worrying about that, but the more the better, I'd think.

[05-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea its where RFOX did their IEO

[05-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll add it to the 'todo' list, once we start getting things squared away.

[05-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Clearly, we have a long ways to go to get there, but I want to get us on at least one of the majors.

[05-Jun-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea I understand it

[05-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> people say theres alot of washtrading there

[05-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but well thats waht happens at most exchanges so

[05-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lol

[05-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> New direction, likely, will be a strong focus on making a UI system for smart contracts. Exact details, we'll work out. We've been talking to some people and amongst ourselves, and this seems the best way to build value in the short term. Right now, smart contracts are a programmers nightmare, and just plain unusable by the general public. If we can make a strong solution for that, we're in business. 
That, in turn, will drive the price, and that will get funding to get back to the basic goals we started this train with ðŸ˜„

[05-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats really true , if that happens adoption will eventually come.

[05-Jun-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The good thing about that is that Crypto Conditions is already part of our chain. We don't have to start from the back end, just the front. The bad thing is neither Cypher or I are great programmers. He's a lot better than me. I'm an old school cracker. Got a lot to learn for modern languages. So, assuming the vote continues the way it is, we need some solid UI programmers.   Particularly, people who are good with Java and/or C++ would be quite helpful. We'll likely make it a bounty project. We will also be using the Agile method to do sprints, so we don't have the mass confusion of the past.

[05-Jun-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm kind of 'on hold' at work right now. Annoying, but it gave me time to grab this ðŸ˜„

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you're familiar with Bitcoin Core, it's easy. If you're not, it's still not terribly hard ðŸ˜„ I THINK you can configure it for HD and use a seed, but I have not tried. When I have some time to experiment, I'll get back to y'all on that.

[05-Jun-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> in it's basic configuration, it's a full node, so the more people running it, the better. Increases network security. The downside, of course, is that you have to have room for the blockchain ðŸ˜›

[05-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Nice from now Im refraining from using anything related to Komodo untl further notice.

[05-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im even using STEX which is not good either but well

[05-Jun-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> if TipBot was online and working could it store 1 million coins plus?

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yes. It's running komodod.

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Withdraw is limited to 1k each right?

[05-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> To clarify, the exploit they discovered only applies to seeds generted in Agama. If you used native mode, or komodod directly, or komodo ocean, it don't apply. I don't know, yet, if it applies to Utrum or BarterDEX, but it might.

[05-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> <that looked like a continuation, this was for @SwimedDragon >I think so. Talk to Auscoin. If you used it as an emergency shelter, I'm sure he would work with you for larger withdraws. Probably would have to be done manually.

[05-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I see

[05-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Anyway... Moving along...

[05-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If you have anything in a 'lite' wallet, I would send it to a full node, or at least generate a new seed and move it that way.

[05-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> people will be skeptical from now suing everytime they use agama

[05-Jun-19 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> its like "cursed "now

[05-Jun-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Easiest way to do it in Agama, if you're using it, is to launch in native mode, generate a new address, close it out, then load the seed, then send it to the new address.

[05-Jun-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Me, I'd just load up Ocean and send it there ðŸ˜› Same deal, though. Just get it off of any old seeds.

[05-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea that way is easy , but you know with a situation like this happening it will be kinda difficult to people to use agama as a "main wallet "

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least Im talking about myself

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ocean seems like a better option

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but involves programming

[05-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, Ocean is complete and ready to go. It's a full GUI client for the Komodo ecosystem. It took them a bit to get it up to date after the update a few months back, but now it works perfectly. I just don't know how to use the HD functions yet. They're there.

[05-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The Utrum wallet has a rewards system, that's what we were (and will be) trying to adapt for EQLI.

[05-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But it is seed/HD based, so it might be affected. I doubt it, it wasn't related to the Agama codebase, but better to wait and find out ðŸ˜›

[05-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Work is really slow today ðŸ˜„ Don't expect me to be so chatty on weekdays as a regular thing...

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea indeed , you know people donâ€™t appear here that much

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> This channels def needs new blood ðŸ˜ƒ

[05-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> My coins are being so slow they havenâ€™t arrived to stex

[05-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I guess itâ€™s a lot of them they are having a hard time ahah

[05-Jun-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They do like 100 confirmations or something like. You can check the transaction in the block explorer.

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> still 11

[05-Jun-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lol

[05-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> maybe tomorrow its thereðŸ˜‚

[05-Jun-19 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Took me about three hours last time. But 11 confirms, the money's safe ðŸ˜„

[05-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I appologize, i do not vote

[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I trust in the masses

[06-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hey all hows it going

[06-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> haha @NWhiskeyTango its always worth voicing your opinion otherwise you are not represented ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> What he said ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> We are not getting delisted in stex are we so I just know

[06-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Bc I have 1million coins plus there ðŸ˜‚

[06-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Because the price is actually now 0,0000000 sats

[06-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> haha you could trade with your self to make some volume ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> hahaha

[06-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> thanks for pointing that out didnt know

[06-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahah yea I could but I would need to deposit some btc there ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I don't think it will allow you to trade for free, but you never know. To the best of my knowledge, we're still good. They warn about delisting, and it did trade some yesterday.

[06-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahhh so itâ€™s still good ?

[06-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I hope we get a heads up for the delisting if it happens so I can get my funds out ðŸ˜‚

[06-Jun-19 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> itâ€™s just 1 millions plus coins

[06-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> dw its still at 1 sat ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> your reading the 24hrs

[06-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> should be fine for now

[06-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahhh cool

[06-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep letâ€™s hope so we need to be at DP

[06-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> that way I can have more of the Komodo assetschains in the same exchange

[06-Jun-19 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ðŸ˜‚

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> we need monkey for that

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Letâ€™s make a petition

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> and to get onto cmc we need 100k volume

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> How much is required

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 100 k usd

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> How much for DP exchange fee

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> i think listing on another exchange should come after

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> They should give us 50% of discount

[06-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> for now we need to focus on the rebuild of the project

[06-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea I know I was just joking because I know I just want us to keep trading in stex

[06-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> things are in the planning stage atm me bio and a few others have been working on it

[06-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> So I can keep my coins there for a few weeks until Komodo sorts this out

[06-Jun-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll be talking to them over the next few days, let them know we're rebuilding. They aren't known for being real quick on the delist hammer.

[06-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea hopefully ðŸ¤ž

[06-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I still have trust in you guys

[06-Jun-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I know you will make it happen

[06-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But yeah, the price is still at 1 sat. I personally recommend getting KomodoOcean and holding your own coins. It's safe, it's only Agama that has the problem. That's just my personal take. I don't keep coins on exchanges for long timeframes. Cryptopia taught me the hard way ðŸ˜›

[06-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yes exactly I know

[06-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well, not the first time, but it's the first time that one got my whole bag. Cryptsy wasn't any fun either, but I only had a fraction of my holdings on it at the time.

[06-Jun-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Those low volume exchanges are always a risk but craptopia I was personally surprised when that happened

[06-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, me too.

[06-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hex and Adam were always pretty straight. It went to hell when they left.

[06-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher> craptopia screwed too many ppl inc myself

[06-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I hope the liquidators at least seriously entertain the buyout offers...

[06-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> the amount I lost wasn't huge, but it was most of my crypto.

[06-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed

[06-Jun-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Gonna get dinner see you guys
