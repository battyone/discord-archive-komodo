[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> For those that are missing rain, maybe try restarting discord

[26-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Ok

[26-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Reminder: We have two live markets right now
https://exrates.me and Barterdex or Hyperdex.  
On Exrates you can trade against BTC, ETH, and USD. Note, that's NOT Tether, it's actual dollars.

[26-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> What about KMD?

[26-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Barterdex üòÑ

[26-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> My shit got rescheduled. I'm back, briefly.

[26-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i see you back as "green" @MassimoStyle

[26-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if you restarted like NWhiskey said i guess it worked

[26-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Why is the rate for btc eql so low on ex rates.me

[26-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Because some idiot is dumping. Get it while it lasts...

[26-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Because someone is dumping at a loss to bring the price down

[26-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It wont be this low for long

[26-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> That's make no sense. I got 2500 for around 100 kmd and now it's under 2 kmd.

[26-Jul-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My advise is to hodl, but that is your choice to make.

[26-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Someone is dumping at ridiculous rates, or it is manipulation. either option cant be sustained for long.

[26-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> It doesn't make sense. Thus why I termed 'em an idiot.

[26-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Break their back :D

[26-Jul-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Lol ofc it's 100 kmd worth it's nothing just wanted to support the project a little :)

[26-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> :D

[26-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Most people are HODLing while it's like this. If you got some small change to spare, scoop it up is my advise. I have been :D

[26-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> How long is there to the first house I sold?

[26-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Is

[26-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> And build?

[26-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Not sure. We're getting everything in order with the legal side, and scouting land. As soon as we have solid information, we'll be letting everyone know. We're also planning some interesting changes to the blockchain involving masternodes and title contracts. Stay tuned!

[26-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Cool thx

[26-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Anytime :D Also, a lot more conversation takes place on the Discord than TG, feel free to join at any time. We'd all be glad to have you.

[26-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> too right, join us there :)

[26-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> How many years can you go before you need new capital? Whitout income? Did you rise enough :)

[26-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <KevinBiomech> Not sure I understand the question. We've raised enough to get things started, but the idea has always been a full economic ecosystem. It will circulate, and we'll continue to build up as we go.

[26-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> We also have interest in our homes as they too will bring in profit which a fraction will go towards helping people too

[26-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> We met with suppliers and people in Puerto Rico as ground work for the mission when we were there in May

[26-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Lets assume your first house is sold In 3 years so the first income you get is there. Can you hold it to there before ico money run out?

[26-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> After 3 years, we will have many built and sold and accomodations as well as storm shelters for those that are struggling which we hope to help save as many lives as possible.

[26-Jul-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> howdy!!

[26-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> hey beast. good seeing you again.

[26-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Ole> Let's say all goes wrong "I don't think it will do" how long can you go before ico money run out. In my mind it will take around 2 years to build such a project.

[26-Jul-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> As we made softcap, we are working on what needs to be done with wallets, contracts and that requires little funding it this stage to have it all in place before we start to build

[26-Jul-18 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
