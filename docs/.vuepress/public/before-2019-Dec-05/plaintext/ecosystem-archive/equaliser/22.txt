[06-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Yep...sung to words of desperado by the eagles...replacing deperado with coffeerardo.

[06-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I love that song

[06-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Love the eagles greatest hits

[06-Jul-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I like the eagles but terrible with song names, just gonna youtube it ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> You know it e when you hear it

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Desperado

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Ah, the start of that song is totally a 'waking in the morning' kind of sound

[06-Jul-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> That's the name of smog

[06-Jul-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Yea it is

[06-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> I've heard that one

[06-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> it is old

[06-Jul-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Cant beat the classics. I hate the droning of the same old recycled pop music songs these days. All the damn same lol

[06-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Although Australia Triple J and Double J is alternative pop which I dont mind

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> yea triple J

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> is pretty good

[06-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> if you don't like that repetitive stuff over and over

[06-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I only just got back into it after a few years. I like liquid DnB kind of euphoric/ambient DnB with female vocals. I work well when listening

[06-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> cool

[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Morning @x2maano

[06-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> there's still a warm feel to the air here

[06-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> even though it's winter

[06-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> winter sux

[06-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It does. i dont use my heater, energy cost is high in SA. just 5 or 6 layers is ok.

[06-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> as long as you walk around in a thermal sleeping bag you'll be ok

[06-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i wish I had solar panels but I rent. i was thinking of getting one to put on the west side facing window

[06-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> charge a battery or something lol

[06-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> charge up a heater would be good

[06-Jul-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> oh hell yeah. That gives me an idea. I have a spare car battery I could charge and maybe get a camp inverter or something. I can heat the room for a bit I spend most of my time to take the edge off.

[06-Jul-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> A couple winters ago I lost 10 kg by not using the heater, I think body was working to keep warm which burned energy

[06-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> haha...part of a good weight loss regime

[06-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I read an article last year on ABC about a study that cold can help with weightloss

[06-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> â˜• here's one a made specially for you

[06-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I would have thought cold would have the opposite effect

[06-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> but it makes sense

[06-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> because your body has to generate heat to heat you up

[06-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> that burns calories

[06-Jul-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> like some ppl that jump in a bath full of ice
