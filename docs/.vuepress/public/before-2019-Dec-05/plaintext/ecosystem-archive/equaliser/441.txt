[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it depends though.. if the gains come like last years bull run most things will have a correction

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> never to these levels

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no way

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> this thing started to be sold fo 33 cents

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If one investor walks in with 1 btc, and market buys this coin, then we are sitting over 1000sats.

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> so you can make the math..

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah relax i don't think dragon meant it would come back to these prices lol

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I know right

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think he is talking about bull run season where things go bananas and then correct

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I sold several million coins at 10 cents during dICO

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> No I didn't meant the prices we have now, lol ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We're ready to leave these prices behind forever

[18-Sep-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It wonâ€™t take much honestly

[18-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I could do that with 0,5 btc now if I wanted

[18-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> xD

[18-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least pushing it to 50-70 sats

[18-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ðŸ˜„

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yep

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im not gonna try tho

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'd expect it will go back down after that unless other people putt in buy orders

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but the question is would you send that much to exrates?

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep def not to exrates

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's hard to keep money for buy orders if you just wanna buy and don't miss out

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I have my acc locked so you see

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah i hope they unlock it soon

[18-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> how long has it been?

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 1 week and half so far

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> damn

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> they said they are gonna unlock it this week

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> lets hope so.

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well at least you heard from them

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats a good sign ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Alright, I am game to buy it all the way up to 34 sats, which will leave the lowest sale order at 48

[18-Sep-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep they are quite dodgy tho

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> do it :d

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> :d

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> the thing is we would need to build a buy wall after that

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so are we organizing a pump here? lolol @Zach

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ahahah

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> or else prices wont stay at those prices lol

[18-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> no pump needed

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> im friends with bill gates ill give him a call one sec

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ðŸ˜¬

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hahaha

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Jeff bezos would be better

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, maybe if you buy it up it creates some fomo

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Probably not enough people on exrates to create real fomo haha

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> I owe jeff money can't call him Zach

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[18-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> nah eqli doesn't need that... it will do it naturally

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but yeah if a whale does come along i wouldn't mind that

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> when we get listed on different exchanges that will happen eventually

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and then we will also be target of pump team signals

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Maybe I should talk in the chat a little about EQL mooning  and then buy it up haha

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> you know the drill..

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If we can go up naturally on this exchange, then we can do anything on other exchanges

[18-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah true Buddz

[18-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> because we are a coin with low market cap and not so high circualting supply

[18-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> low volume

[18-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> is what they will love..

[18-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> it wont take much to drive this price exponencially up

[18-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least for now we are safe from those people

[18-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> not just results from the project but a pure a lack of sellers will also drive price.
think about who owns the coins...has to be 60% or more owned by the founders, major devs, and the wallet to pay out masternode holders.
the rest of the top 20-30 holders are people like us.
so in terms of numbers buyers will outweigh sellers by a wide margin...supply and demand economics

[18-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yes true but i don't see volume staying like this much longer

[18-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> true c2k

[18-Sep-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can see all of us want to keep an hundred thousand or so to buy a dome eventually

[18-Sep-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> its a job hazard for me but i look at everything like a stock. 
how widely is it held
who are the major holders
how thin is the float
etc

[18-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> this project has all the makings of a >10x very very soon. and beyond that who knows

[18-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> for us who got in so cheap this is one of those coins that every person in crypto dreams to find

[18-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> not only that but its for a good cause as well

[18-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> win win ðŸ˜ƒ

[18-Sep-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep this has true purpose its a matter of time untill we start seeing big movement.

[18-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Honestly, we should enjoy the chat the way it is right now

[18-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Within a few months, the whole chat will be different if we get a lot more people

[18-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure. we just have to figure out a better way to attract people to this discord

[18-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
