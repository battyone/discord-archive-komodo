[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to get more coin so I can add to the support on here.

[21-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Coin as in BTC to support the wall?

[21-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Or Komodo could just go parabolic for the next 3 months and run up to 250 usd and make me look like a god on twitter lol

[21-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[21-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Then we have no worries either way.

[21-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> lol hell yeah @CowboyCrypto- Founder - that proof of concept vid will make us all sitting pretty üëç :vote_up:

[21-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I agree, media like a completed house will jump the price

[21-Sep-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will take more than that though. We will need people to basically become fanatics about it, much like ripple supporters.

[21-Sep-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have a shitload of work to get done from all angles of this project, but I am doing as much as I can with what i have.

[21-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Patience is truly a virtue, and I have plenty üòÉ

[21-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> my plan is to keep trading up the rest of my BTC in other stuff so that I can continue to support EQLI all the way up

[21-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Unfortunately I havent had a ton of luck lately..

[21-Sep-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You guys ever have one of those moments where things just click for ya? Thats what happened when I originally thought this idea up. I thought, " This is what I want to define my work existance."

[21-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I can help get homeless people back in the game, then we got ourselves a real shot at changing the world for a great number of people. If one of those people goes on to do something amazing, then we will have played a small part in facilitating that event.

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> And that is why I support this project

[21-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That is an awesome  vision, rather than most of the altcoin projects that are seemingly just there for the money

[21-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Honestly I have gone broke with launching this.

[21-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> put all of my crypto into getting it going.

[21-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Hopefully you have enough to keep yourself afloat for alittle while longer until you can start cashing a little out

[21-Sep-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Im sure that fiasco with David? and the pumps didnt help anything either

[21-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
