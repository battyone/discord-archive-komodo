[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> memory association

[16-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> thats another good trick to help remember

[16-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> could be more of an audio learner

[16-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> possibly, people have different ways of retaining info and learning.

[16-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, it doesn't work with everything. But I do like a lot of songs. Even after hearing them 100 times I can't sing along besides one part.

[16-Jul-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only after I read and sing along the song both together, so seeing the lines, and singing it, I remember the song very easely

[16-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Interesting

[16-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Imagine my family's reaction if I'm going to sing the whitepaper üòÇ

[16-Jul-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm the same, i can never remember lyrics either, I focus on melody. cant remeber song names or band names mostly

[16-Jul-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Sing the white paper...lol

[16-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> @AndronicusBass yea I focus on the rhythm more than lyrics as well

[16-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Audio book whitepapers

[16-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Mantra to music

[16-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I lost interest in it 10 years ago but only recently started to listen to it and dnb it makes me work faster and typing on the keyboard quicker

[16-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
