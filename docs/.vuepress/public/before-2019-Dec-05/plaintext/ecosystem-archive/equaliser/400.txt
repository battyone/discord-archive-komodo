[03-Sep-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> I'm on porridge this morning. It's going to be a crazy day for me. Concrete mixture broke down last Friday and we have to do 12 bags by hand this morning😬 😁

[03-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> mixing concrete by shovel in a wheelbarrow is tiring

[03-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> very tiring

[03-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Damn. but look at the positive, mixing concrete by hand with a shovel really is a good workout

[03-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, just don't breath in all the dust

[03-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I find protein shakes after helps reduce pain the next day

[03-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> until it gets moist enough

[03-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Yeah that's about to happen it's crazy

[03-Sep-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, I cant stress enough for people to use a respirator or face mask

[03-Sep-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Haha its but you do get tired and feel beating

[03-Sep-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Im a safety hound on the construction site, always looking for potential hazards and mitigation strategies

[03-Sep-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> or if anything is laying around i move it to a safe place so its not a trip hazard lol

[03-Sep-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> Good

[03-Sep-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟KQweci☄-Mod> My boss kind of piss me off sometimes as he doesn't like spending much in work materials

[03-Sep-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've applied for an atmospheric gas testing class, fingers crossed it I get accepted

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> PPE is important. Most countries will allow you to claim back in tax for money spent on materials for work purposes

[03-Sep-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yes, good luck

[03-Sep-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
