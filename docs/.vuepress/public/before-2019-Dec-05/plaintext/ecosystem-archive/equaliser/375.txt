[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Oh sunshine has been awesome this weekend, damn the winter darkness, almost over.

[26-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> @AndronicusBass-Founder hi, where about's are you. I am in the Philippines

[26-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Australia

[26-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I am from Rosehill NSW but I have now retired to live in the Philippines

[26-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I can't stand the cold in my old age

[26-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Small world, I used to live in Harris Park over 10 years ago.

[26-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I bet it is warm and humid over in the Phillipines

[26-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> It is but you get used to it. Harris Park & Parramatta have changed so much over the last 16 years

[26-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> Are you still in NSW?

[26-Aug-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> They have changed indeed, before that I lived in burwood and accidentally got the express train to parramatta which was the first time I saw it when it was dingy and dangerous looking, houses were relatively cheap back then compared to today. No, I'm in Adelaide, Sydney got too expensive and crowded so I left in 2007. Now the same thing is happening in Adelaide, houses are a ripoff and unaffordable to many without sacrificing quality of life just to get a mortgage. I'm done with that paradigm and ready to kick mortgage ass with affordable homes üòÅ üòé ‚úå

[26-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I agree, I left it too late in life to tie ourselves up in a mortgage. We cannot afford the lifestyle that we like in Australia but with the assistance of my wife's family we can get by here on just a little income.

[26-Aug-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I did look at other parts of the country when we sold but as you say affordability is going through the roof. We love Australia but we just do not want to live there if its below the poverty line

[26-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Real happiness family and freedom especially freedom from the clutter of useless consumer products many of us dont need. living comfortably on a small income is the illusive dream you are living üòÉ Shows that anything is possible üëå

[26-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> thanks my friend

[26-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I see from the header that we are supposed to be talking about the coin, maybe I should go to another room?

[26-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's no worries, this channel used to be called general, I still chat generally here

[26-Aug-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont use off-topic much, its not a channel I like to chat in

[26-Aug-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> ok your the boss, will it help me gain experience/level in here?

[26-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah it will üòÉ

[26-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And I agree, I prefer to chat here because in off-topic, comments can get lost between rains at times

[26-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> too right.

[26-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> hi @SwimedDragon welcome to our chat

[26-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sorry, didn't mean to interupt

[26-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> I see my friend @jester21 is an apprentice here

[26-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SquireAu> @SwimedDragon no problem, we were just passing time of day & reminiscing
