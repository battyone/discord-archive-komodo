[07-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I don't care if it's the latest and greatest

[07-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> as long as it can do phone ok and browse internet and do discord

[07-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> THATS WHAT IM SAYING.............LOL

[07-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> jellysmash - gold words

[07-Jul-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you have the kind of phone that does only text and calls?

[07-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Yes. I have two phones. The second is Nokia 8800 for calls only

[07-Jul-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> chinese phones are good and cheap

[07-Jul-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Huwai....that's what I have

[07-Jul-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> cheap and still good enough specification

[07-Jul-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> old phones only do text and calls...like the one before I got

[07-Jul-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> when I got a huwai smart phone

[07-Jul-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I'm going to get a smart phone whenever my old text/call phone needs replacement.

[07-Jul-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> be hard not to get a smart phone now-a-days

[07-Jul-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> 99% of phones in shops are smart phones

[07-Jul-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> might be able to get a $20 button phone, old style

[07-Jul-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> i thought they shipped all those to 3rd world countries

[07-Jul-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> that only have 2 G networks

[07-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> get a smart phone

[07-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> even a small Samsung can be cheap

[07-Jul-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> small screen though

[07-Jul-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i unfortunately need a big screen, big hands. Always like a good screen to read news and information. I like to also make sure im on social media and on here when Im AFK

[07-Jul-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> well a good screen needs to how porn well

[07-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> whoops did I just think aloud then??

[07-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> oh well

[07-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @jellysmash no what you said :P

[07-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> hahaha

[07-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> well, we're kinda all thinking it

[07-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Well I have been using my phone since 2012 still works like a charm

[07-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> I'm just saying

[07-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it's the batteries that seem to be the problem these days

[07-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> they just don't last

[07-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> I have the flagship oneplus one

[07-Jul-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> It was my first phone hehe bought with my own monies and hardworking

[07-Jul-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In the past, it used to be cheaper to pay off a phone as part of a phone plan, I would end up paying about 1/3 to 1/2 of the phone retail price over 24 months instead of buying outright

[07-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> i've always paid outright and got prepaid plan

[07-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> still adding money to buy a phone new one........

[07-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> always found those monthly plans were very expensive

[07-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> well....more than I'm willing to pay..

[07-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> i'm a bit of a tight arse when it comes to paying for mobile

[07-Jul-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AdventureCrypto> same i like prepaid

[07-Jul-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
