[31-Jul-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Okay I'm way behind. But to answer an earlier question. Exrates is lowering their fees. It's on their Twitter. Unfortunately that's all the detail I've got. EQL is also on barterdex. We are working with other exchanges, but no solid timeline yet.

[31-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Can we have a chat about other coins or is that against the rules? Just wondering others opinions on some other alt coins
