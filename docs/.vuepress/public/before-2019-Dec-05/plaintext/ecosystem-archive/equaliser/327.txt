[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Someone bought on marketmaker during the dICO for atleast 10c and has been dumping for a fraction of that. It doesn't make sense

[16-Aug-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> I think this will remain a mystery lol

[16-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But I mean how much has been able to buy? Can't be an infinite supply? I have bought some myself, I know a couple otheres here done the same

[16-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Or they are selling secretly at 2x profit again on exrates, also possible

[16-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> yes has to be running out... but they also could of picked some up cheap when people panic sold

[16-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> and then you also have people on the exchange who will dump for quick profits

[16-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> pretty straight forward process: We will acquire land, We will build houses, Title homes and register them within our blockchain, Then we will place them up for sale on the EMP, where we will then add  new ownership notation within our blockchain to act as a secondary registry.
