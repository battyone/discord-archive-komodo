[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> and when the guitar player (ex US navy) would ask me what was happening in Syria I would tell him the truth. . He didn't appreciate that much

[23-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> not did they appreciate my feelings for Israel

[23-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I've read assad is loved and is doing good things

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> is that correct?

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> i have a different view to most people on this

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @AndronicusBass-Founder let's put it this way. . if it were not for the Syrian army, my whole family would be dead right now

[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah that i agree with

[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I'd also like to mention that HEzbollah, Iran, and Russia helped us out

[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I just know alot of western media put alot of spin or out right bs villifying countries and leaders that are not as bad as they seem

[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> my mums in Lebanon right now.. a couple of her Syrian friends actually were on the same flight to Lebanon... they are heading over to Syria but need to go threw Lebanon

[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> If it wasn't for Russia ISIS would be controlling Syria right now

[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> and most likely would of spilled over into Lebanon

[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> At the same time I don't look at Assad or the Syria Army as good guys

[23-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> my cousins mate was actually in the Syrian Army

[23-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> oh yeah we are going to do this at our 3d printed built house from EQLI

[23-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> (trying to keep the convo eqli related)

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> @MySoulisNotForSale have you told them about EQLI yet?

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> then let's go to off topic

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> they don't need eql

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> so what

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont have any issue with off topic in here for now, discord is quiet everywhere and the off-topic channel gets interupted with rain and bot commands

[23-Aug-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ok boss

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yeah personally i don't think off topic/rain channel is a good idea

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> sometimes people actually trying to have a convo then the rain interrupts it

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> but im still on a rain strike

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> why

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> rain strike until we hit 1000 followers on twitter

[23-Aug-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Plus in here, anyone from telegram and komodo discord can join in with the bridge

[23-Aug-18 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> nah im not watching any conspiracy videos now

[23-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> why did you tip me

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> i been meaning to tip you for a while

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> because you never on when i rain

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I used to watch conspiracy videos and decided its a waste of time for me I could be focusing my energy on things I can change

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yep i am about the same bass

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> but i do like to know what is going on

[23-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> i just dont dig too deep anymore

[23-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, good to be across whats happening, just not too far into it.

[23-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> it's not really a conspiracy. . it's more like "real news" instead of Zionist spew (made in hollywood script)

[23-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> i've already seen most of those videos

[23-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I know there are too many questions and inconsistencies

[23-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> I tell you what though ..

[23-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> it's refreshing to be able to mention the Z word here

[23-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lets just say my official view is there is truth to almost all of them but some of the people making the videos go a little too far

[23-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The Z is about supremacy

[23-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> control and supremacy yep

[23-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> wooooooooooooooooooo

[23-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> finished work for the day

[23-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> im thinking i should buy some more kmd?

[23-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Our prime minister owns about $50m in investment property, used to be a banker for HSBC and still doesnt want to admit there is a housing affordability crisis. he also didnt want to have an investigation into australian banks and financial institutions.

[23-Aug-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> of course not

[23-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> how much is kmd?

[23-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> @AndronicusBass-Founder well there isn't a housing affordability crisis.... not for him and his friends anyway

[23-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> lol

[23-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
