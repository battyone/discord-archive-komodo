[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hope it goes really well though

[27-Aug-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No worries I am going to start trials on aircrete stability

[27-Aug-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôll take a while to dial this in perfectly but once the recipe is established, it‚Äôs on and crackin

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Awesome  @CowboyCrypto

[27-Aug-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Really looking forward To seeing / hearing the results

[27-Aug-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Apparently is like mixing up a cake mixture

[27-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> A cake mixture of awesome üòâ

[27-Aug-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Create a template of what shape you want....and then mass produce them....just mix and pour.....mix and pour

[27-Aug-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Very light as well

[27-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exactly

[27-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If your consistency isn‚Äôt right the concrete will collapse

[27-Aug-18 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We are taking every step to create the strongest blend we can

[27-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> The more concrete powder you put in to the ratio and mix....the stronger it is

[27-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But also more expensive and heavier

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> How's your day?

[27-Aug-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> Monday is a quiet day

[27-Aug-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> much of discord is in the crypto world lately

[27-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> pump eeet...those twitter followers

[27-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> lol

[27-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> much of crypto is in the discord  world lately. ....as well

[27-Aug-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @gh√∏st  mondays are hard

[27-Aug-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> quiet ...yea...but very busy

[27-Aug-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and tiring

[27-Aug-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm trying to do some other stuff now it's more quiet on discord

[27-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Easier to cut discord time when it's quiet

[27-Aug-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I just make sure Im around as much as possible

[27-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's nice to have notifications, but I have turned the sound off because it alway's interupts in the music I listen

[27-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not many new people these day's, and even the folks that came for the rains seem to have left

[27-Aug-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Sound notifications are pointless if you are on may servers lol. constant dinging

[27-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not sure if you can turn them off for each server, but I just did for all

[27-Aug-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah in discord settings

[27-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ah I see, thanks üòÉ Can even turn off the @ here/everyone messages

[27-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not doing that, but I have to say those taggs are overused in many servers

[27-Aug-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only reason I'm not turning those taggs off is because you can miss important messages, but most are voting and bounty reminders

[27-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And some servers even post it 2 or even 3 times in different rooms, same message

[27-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Like they have a twitter room for twitter stuff, and an announcement room. They will post twitter announcements in both, really annoying at times

[27-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I did some cleaning up on discord servers, left the most annoying ones

[27-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you often watching discord while it has no chats?

[27-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I check in and try to not leave any one hanging üòÉ yeah there is abuse of the here and everyone tags, I personally dont like to use it at all

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> i;ve tunred off notifications on most of my discord channels...

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yep way too annoying

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I could hardly type without the notification box popping up constantly

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I turned notifications off to 'only mentioned' for most discord

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ...except Equaliser

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I want ot make sure I get al the Equalise 'chat'

[27-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and know what's going on
