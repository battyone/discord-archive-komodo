[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm gonna smoke a cig, then I'm gonna try on Windows.

[01-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> no orders on yperdex eiter

[01-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yeah cool your mind 😄

[01-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, there should, SHOULD, be an order up at .02697303 KMD per EQL.

[01-Aug-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> actually hyperdex orders expire after sometime unlike bdex which stays for quite some time

[01-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah. That's why I am trying to use bdex.

[01-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> With good til cancelled.

[01-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> let's hope it et's there

[01-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nothing showing, I take it?

[01-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I am outside right now. Getting my temper under lock.

[01-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> why is your temper flaring up?

[01-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Did someone do something to you nasty?

[01-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> nope nothing

[01-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Barterdex pissing me off 😄

[01-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yes bdex is ducking with him 😛

[01-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I project a calm exterior pretty well. But I am Cherokee, Sioux, German, Norwegian, and Scot. You can imagine what my REAL temper is like 😛

[01-Aug-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> The Scot/Irish thing scared me.. i understand what gibberish they speak 😛

[01-Aug-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yay!!

[01-Aug-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> 😛

[01-Aug-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm American. Don't understand half the gibberish my own speak.

[01-Aug-18 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> ahahaha

[01-Aug-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> they are on a total ne work when speaking

[01-Aug-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, I'm back, gonna set up Bdex on my home system under Windows and see if I have any better luck.

[01-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good luck

[01-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Downloading the new version 😛

[01-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Might take a while.

[01-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> HDD is filling up fast.

[01-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 👍

[01-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, can someone have a look at Bdex? I have an order up, let's see if it's visible. EQL/KMD pair.

[01-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ...and do any of you have any experience with the "Enable auto-price market maker mode" box?

[01-Aug-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Or a good reference for it?

[01-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ... it seems to be showing up on my remote that I was previously trying to run it on... I guess the 1.1 version just doesn't like me.

[01-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> i'll load it back up

[01-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Thanks.

[01-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also.. does placing a new order cancel the old one?

[01-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> i don't think so, but not 100% sure

[01-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Cuz it just did 😄 Was trying to build a few for a book.

[01-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yep, that's me.

[01-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> nice

[01-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> maybe it's a firewall issue on ubuntu

[01-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Guess it don't like Linux. Also is the 2 hour old release.

[01-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> May be, but I wouldn't think so.

[01-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> my understanding is that the bdex devs mainly dev on linux 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'll look in to it. Ubuntu usually ain't that picky.

[01-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> so i'm pleasantly surprised  when things work smoothly on windows, not the other way around :squee:

[01-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Right?

[01-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> if it wasn't for directx i would switch completely 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, gonna put up orders on BTC, LTC, USDT and BCH as well. Hopefully goes smooth.

[01-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> also my mining setup is very easy on windoze

[01-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> LOL. I'm not a gamer. DX is meaningless to me.

[01-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Really? You got a mining rig to actually talk to Windows? That's half of why I got into linux 😛

[01-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> gpu mining i thought was easier on windows from reading people's reddit posts 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> May be now.

[01-Aug-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I haven't done serious mining since '15

[01-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> glad it works for you now anyways

[01-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's a start. Would really prefer to run it on the Droplet. But I'll take what I can get 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> one thing i need to dive into is just manipulating marketmaker without a gui

[01-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> that would be the ideal way to add a bit of permanence

[01-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That would be cool. I know it's doable 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And would probably work on Linux 😛

[01-Aug-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, I now have EQL paired against BCH, BTC, LTC, KMD, and USDT. Anything else y'all would like it paired against? (Say Ethereum and I'll strangle you...)

[01-Aug-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> The moon:facebook: :facebook: :Celebration:

[01-Aug-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <beastMode> lol

[01-Aug-18 07:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Don't think Mooncoin is there... but I'll look.

[01-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well I'll be damned 😛

[01-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <skyfyre> Night guys

[01-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It is there.

[01-Aug-18 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Night @skyfyre

[01-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ain't doin' it, Tango 😄 MOON is worthless right now. 3 1/1000ths of a penny...

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> sounds like a plan.

[01-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I made soooo much on mooncoin last year

[01-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Bought .4 btc at 1 sat and sold it at 5

[01-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's a cyclical bastard. I had forgotten it existed 😛

[01-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I just put up a trade at 160 ROI for 1 EQL... 😄

[01-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I like ROI, but it ain't worth much yet.

[01-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[01-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> lol that's a pretty damn good return there

[01-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> 1 to 5 lol

[01-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah nova exchange was my gem hunter playground

[01-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> It's nice when your plans work out right?

[01-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> 🐕

[01-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Coffee is not good for dogs

[01-Aug-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[01-Aug-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> dogs are not good for coffee, either.

[01-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Absolutely correct @Biomech-Founder

[01-Aug-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> And eithers are not good dogs for coffee
