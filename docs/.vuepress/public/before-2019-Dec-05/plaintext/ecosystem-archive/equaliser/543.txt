[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Not bad here

[23-Jan-19 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Been fighting sickness but otherwise fine

[23-Jan-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think this week will let us test single pour wall slabs

[23-Jan-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice one. Single pour wall slabs will make assembly much quicker than traditional construction, and cheaper

[23-Jan-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> how's work going?

[23-Jan-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hope it's not super busy again

[23-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> you need a bit more of a break first

[23-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> my work is very busy straight away after the break

[23-Jan-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå single poured wall panels will allow us to assemble 8x8 walls with 2 pieces

[23-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So if it‚Äôs successful we will get weight on them and assess the best way to proceed

[23-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ok, cool

[23-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Hi @linkara6669 I hope you get something soon. Hope other than that, everything else is going good?

[23-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> @AndronicusBass besides not having a job still, and my gma passing, I've been alright, stressed though

[23-Jan-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> how about you?

[23-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, I remember when my pop passed and he told me to remember the good times and celebrate his life not to worry about death. Easier said than done but It helped. I just managed to find a job in time before I had to leave where I live for being behind on rent and bills. Took a few months unfortunately, grinding to catch up. Equaliser is a labour of love, not paying ourselves

[dscrdeql] <nille> good morning all

[dscrdeql] <Adrian üëΩ> Happy birthday to all romanian!

[24-Jan-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The party still going? That is one proud country my friend. I feel embarrassed to be Australian because what I warned people about years ago was found to be fact through official investigation. No one listened to me and I co-founded Equaliser as an alternative means to speak out and change the status quo/paradigm. No one can afford to buy a house in Australia now renting a house is getting expensive and homelessness is increasing I see with my own eyes when I go through the city on my way to work

[24-Jan-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> doesnt stop most from having the latest gadgets and tech plus nice cars

[24-Jan-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[24-Jan-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> still 33 degrees here

[24-Jan-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no air con gonna be hard to sleep tonight üòÆ

[24-Jan-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Combat Wombat Do you not have a fan? Those cheap ones to stir the air do ok. It's almost impossible to sleep when air is still when it's hot

[24-Jan-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder yeah of course got fans its better then nothing makes it bearable lol

[24-Jan-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> gotta move out of this house soon anyway so next place will have air coin ü§û

[24-Jan-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's a balancing act of opening the windows at the right time to allow air flow when the wind picks up  and also closing them when the wind subsides to prevent stagnant heat. It's an art after a while. The place I rent has no insulation or ventilation in the ceiling. Yeah for sure, find a place to rent within your means however, down under, rent's are increasing rapidly.

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> wont be dropping below 30 tonight

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> so probably pointless to be opening windows

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and there isn't much wind

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> its just a crappy night

[24-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> tomorrow will drop from 40's to mid 20s in 15 mins üòÑ

[24-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm sick of it. Those of us that rent, cant afford buying a house, while wage growth has stagnated for several years, I see prices rising at food places. What I thought would happen is happening now.

[24-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yeah rent sucks but i just quit smoking so i can throw that money onto rent

[24-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> things will probably get worse dude

[24-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> our politicians keep selling us out to china

[24-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> yay

[24-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[24-Jan-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I believe china's estimates of growth have been grossly over estimated. The figures from a communist country might be pretty accurate, not. ozzy land relies heavily on china, plus a buch of other stuff but we are screwed as a country. I wont be part of it because I saw it when i learned the basics of economics. our poly's are not economists, its all business

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> china is taking over the world

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thats all i know

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> china buy everything

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> china take over

[24-Jan-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> our politicians are crooks and sells outs

[24-Jan-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i might vote for clive palmer

[24-Jan-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> anytthing would be better then labor or liberal

[24-Jan-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> üí©

[24-Jan-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No they're not. They just saw the opportunity to leverage to the max when the rest of the world was using debt to grow. china mines the most gold in the world and export's 0% and is the largest buyer of australian mined gold.

[24-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i think they are crooks and sell outs

[24-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> and i dislike china

[24-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> communism, what do you expect? lol

[24-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well these days  the left thinks communism is good

[24-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i just want cryptos to hurry up and do something so i can go buy a little farm

[24-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> lol

[24-Jan-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> boooooooooooooooooom!

[24-Jan-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> even tipsy likes that idea üòÑ

[24-Jan-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> the media is brainwashing our younger generations that communism is the way. they should travel and experience the world and visit communist countries instead of telling us older people what to do when they have not experienced the basic struggles of life themselves. Not everyone has been to university, I hope they wake up but university is professional indoctrination

[24-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i agree with ya

[24-Jan-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> well lets hope people wake up üôå

[24-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Common sense is experience, not education

[24-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> in this day and age

[24-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> but common sense isn't that common or sensible üòÑ i love that saying haha

[24-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Common sense ain't that common lol

[24-Jan-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Well, if you think about it, there is no more comedy shows like fast forward and totally full frontal, PC culture is real life comedy LMFAO!
