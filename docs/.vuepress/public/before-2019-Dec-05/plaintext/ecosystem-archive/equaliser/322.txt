[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> probably...I'm hoping so

[15-Aug-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> New people still get a chance to buy cheaply üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> When EQLI goes way up, I wonder if we ever gonna see these low prices again

[15-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't think so üòÑ

[15-Aug-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> doubt it

[15-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> its way way way way way way below dICO price

[15-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> when market recovers plus new exchanges watch eql sky rocket

[15-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> how many coins sold at dICO?

[15-Aug-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> um i think it was 49 mil?

[15-Aug-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> wow

[15-Aug-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> you would have to fact check with one of the founders though

[15-Aug-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> what kind of idiot would buy at that dICO price and dump now?

[15-Aug-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> thats the million dollar question haha

[15-Aug-18 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Myke500> Or $0 question if your that guy

[15-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes

[15-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm really curious if that guy is in here

[15-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> same probably is

[15-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> HEY! I think I fixed downvotes... need a ... volunteer üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> hehe @Combot Wombot you're the one

[15-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> üòÇ

[15-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> nice name btw

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> im still here

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> i didn't change my name

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> one of you guys did lol

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Console shows...
```
*** ADDED DOWNVOTE ***
*** Combot Wombot has been docked -250 XP ***
--> XP AWARD --> -250
*** MESSAGE STRIKE 1 of 40 ***
```

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> perfect

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> üëå

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> removing it shows:

```
*** REMOVED DOWNVOTE ***
*** Combot Wombot has been awarded 250 XP ***
--> XP AWARD --> 250
```

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> removing them undoes the adding btw

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> and no message strikes

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> nps is there any chance we can get a lucky feature?

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> hm?

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> like ?lucky 5

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> and it randomly picks one active user

[15-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> oh haha already working on it

[15-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> hhaha you thought of it all üëå :EQLI:

[15-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Another server had a similar function called "Lightning" where it "strikes" a single user

[15-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> And "Thunder" which picks like 3-5 randoms

[15-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> yep ive seen that one

[15-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> pretty cool as well

[15-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Wanted to incorporate something similar

[15-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> i wont complain üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> I also have a few other ideas I'm working on to really make EQLI playtime fun

[15-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> haha nice üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Myke500> Ive also seen DRIZZLE for the last 5 users to speak in chat

[15-Aug-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Those ideas are cool üòé

[15-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> I love most of the commands some are very cool like

[15-Aug-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> ?wuoted

[15-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combot Wombot> keep commands in #off-topic or #bot-commands but im pretty sure what you typed isn't a command lol

[15-Aug-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> wuoted?

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> @Myke500 not a bad idea either!

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I didn't realise you could get down voted

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> knew upvoted but didnt' realise down vote

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe for nasty stuff

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> or toxic comments

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> makes sense to have a down vote

[15-Aug-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> if you have an upvote

[15-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Yeah man, decentralized community crowd control

[15-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Troll trap üòÉ

[15-Aug-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> ?explain votes

[15-Aug-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> ok

[15-Aug-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...troll trap

[15-Aug-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> dont' want no trolls around here

[15-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev == (auscoi)> Anyway all I gotta run for a while... AFK for a few hours at least

[dscrdeql] <blademaster> Closest i find is panda

[15-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Good idea Steve

[15-Aug-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> How about tipping at level advancements? Or at least some significant levels?

[15-Aug-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Like, read level 5, get 5, reach level 99 get 99

[15-Aug-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> For reaching every significat level total earned tips like 500.

[15-Aug-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> If someone already stated that, im sorry...just busy and behind on a lot of stuff
