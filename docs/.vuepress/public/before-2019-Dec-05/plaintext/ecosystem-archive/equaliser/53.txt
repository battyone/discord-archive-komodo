[dscrdeql] <Llama> what are the chances that you can make a dome yacht?

[08-Jul-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I took a nap and I feel worse then before

[08-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I hate that it's just a 50/50 chance to me to feel better or worse after a nap.

[08-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> how long was it for

[08-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Bout to shower and get the salt water off me

[08-Jul-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tanya> i try not to go past 30 min naps

[08-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It was 45-60 minutes I think

[08-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That‚Äôs a good nap

[08-Jul-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Llama anything is possible

[08-Jul-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> A dome would be somewhat difficult. A slightly assymentrical sphere, egg shaped actually, would be a fairly good design for a seastead.

[08-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Bottom of it would be ballast, which could easily be partially fresh water storage üòÑ

[08-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> giant floating sphere

[08-Jul-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama> that just rolls around
