[19-Aug-18 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We may be changing a few plans for concept. With markets being down we are thinking of building here in the states

[19-Aug-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> To be clear, if we do, we're still going to Puerto Rico. Just might do proof of concept in the US.

[19-Aug-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Noice!

[19-Aug-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Local POC is always a great way to go

[19-Aug-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also, a lot of technical advances and changes are taking place in the Komodo project, and we may end up redirecting to meet with that as well. Some of it's pretty exciting.

[19-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will allow us to get our first home built much faster

[19-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Give the consumer/investors something to touch

[19-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yep, exactly. Grand plans are marvelous, but you have to start with what you can reasonably achieve. 2018 Bear Season hit at exactly the wrong moment.

[19-Aug-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And we'll get there on the grand plans üòÑ

[19-Aug-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
