[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> @Biomech i am a pretty wide range actually. i can sing pop, have a middle to high end voice, was a Tenor 1 when I was in choir in high school. Always been good at the high range. But I can do metal also. I like to sing the song Bodies by Drowning Pool. People tell me they think i nail it every time i sing it.Some have said they like my version better

[29-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Sweet!

[29-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> So most rock styles i like to sing

[29-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can hit about 5 octaves. Full range is E1 to about F5, but there are some notes in the mid range I just can't hit 😛

[29-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> Can almost pull off some Steven Tyler type stuff lol

[29-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As to the wallets... fully synched, Block explorer and seed nodes back online and fully up to snuff. Electrum (spv) servers, I'm still working on it. ElectrumX is giving me an issue, the node itself is good. Probably just a config thing. I literally got up ten minutes ago, not gonna attempt it before some serious caffeine.

[29-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @linkara6669 I can't do the scream in Dream On anymore 😄 But I could when I was young.

[29-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> haha i hear that man, me too

[29-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can still hit the note, but a 50 year old throat... I cough 😄

[29-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> I'm 31, totally agreeabout the throat thing. I have done a lot of the scream singing, which has made it a lot tougher for me to do stuff like that lol

[29-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Strangely enough, since I have a very low speaking voice, high is much easier than low, and that's easier than midrange 😛

[29-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> lol

[29-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> always interesting that way

[29-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> hardest for me is low notes. i have a bit higher speaking voice

[29-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <linkara6669> when i was working drive thrus as the order taker, other guys would think i was a female at times, and I'd be like, ya, no haha

[29-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's an effort, but I can hit into the bass register consistently. In about the third octave, I choke if I don't put some serious roughness in it 😛

[29-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Then again, so do two of my heroes.

[29-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I sound a lot like Bruce Dickinson on the middle and high register. This will never be a shame to me 😄
