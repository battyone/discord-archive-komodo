[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> 🤗

[18-Sep-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, ok, I'm at work

[18-Sep-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> In a meeting

[18-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Oh so really it’s give you like 3% return after 90 days?

[18-Sep-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> 2.5 more like it

[18-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Guess any guaranteed return is a good one though. 1 year is 25% apr, so that’s pretty decent

[18-Sep-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, very good return

[18-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 25k on a 100k lock up is pretty decent

[18-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you bought at these prices in a year you’ll be happy about your investment more than likely

[18-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Do you mean 25k on a 100k lock up?

[18-Sep-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah sorry it must’ve autocorrect

[18-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It gets locked in a contract wallet

[18-Sep-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> As I understand

[18-Sep-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Looking forward to getting some more details, sounds like it's gonna be an great return on investment

[18-Sep-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> That's an awesome GUARANTEED return of 25%....wow

[18-Sep-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> EQLI rocks🤘

[18-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Great progress

[18-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> So much going on

[18-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Especially when we are just reinvesting all profits from the house we sell.

[18-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’d really love to build an Equaliser community in PR.

[18-Sep-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Maybe just create our own small city there lol

[18-Sep-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> You guys are doing awesome things here! New houses and such. Any return is better then no return i just wish the value was a little higher and it shpuld be based off the humanity of things. People cray cray

[18-Sep-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Where is the other dev?

[18-Sep-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Lol....create an Equaliser city town in PR

[18-Sep-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> What did i miss?

[18-Sep-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s doable

[18-Sep-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @CowboyCrypto- Founder About that 10% for 90 day's, If you set aside 400k, you would get 10k after 90 day's, right?

[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> good morning!

[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good morning @ghøst 😃

[18-Sep-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hey there  @ghøst

[18-Sep-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> 👀

[18-Sep-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I saw a ghost

[18-Sep-18 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Nothing like running errands all day, good times

[18-Sep-18 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @SwimedDragon 9863 and some dust by my calculations

[18-Sep-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Ok, yeah I was using the 90 day's to 360 to make a simple estimated calculation

[18-Sep-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But you would get it paid out every day, if I understand it correctly

[18-Sep-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Can we also set aside different amounts of 100k for different timeframes?

[18-Sep-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You should be able to

[18-Sep-18 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> That would be very nice 😃

[18-Sep-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> At the end of your contract, then rewards will drop off and your original coins will be returned

[18-Sep-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think I'm obviously going to putt some amount on different times

[18-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't think it would be wise to lock everything up for 700 day's, although the rewards would be nice that way

[18-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Longer the term the better the payout

[18-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, that payout is very nice

[18-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> 3.5 times as much as locking up for 90 day's. I think I'm going to splitt it up, so using 3 timeframes to lock up

[18-Sep-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I need to do some math tomorrow to figure rewards amounts

[18-Sep-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think lots of us will be using the 365 or 700 day's option haha

[18-Sep-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I'll make sure to splitt it out

[18-Sep-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't want to miss a bull run sell chance on everything we got haha

[18-Sep-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But imagine setting aside 1m for 700 day's if you got those numbers 😮

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> For the first year, wouldn't that mean like near 1k EQLI a day as reward?

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You’ll still be getting pay out

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yup

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’ll be locking mine up and I bought all I could

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, imagine if EQLI gets up to like 10 cents

[18-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s been .33 usd

[18-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 😉

[18-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> You can sell or use the payout as you like right?

[18-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[18-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Is that the rate used for new exchanges, the 0.33 price?

[18-Sep-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No sadly they’ll go off current market

[18-Sep-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Whatever market decision is

[18-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> good morning

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[18-Sep-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> More EQLI price action, went up to 26 sats....just as well I bought some at 20 in the morning

[18-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really think and hope this is the last chance to pick EQLI up this cheap

[18-Sep-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I had a couple low orders in but gave up on them and just bought at market rate which was 20. Didn't want to miss out

[18-Sep-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Maybe last chance

[18-Sep-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Especially with masternode changes to give a good guaranteed reward.

[18-Sep-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, those rewards are very nice 😃
