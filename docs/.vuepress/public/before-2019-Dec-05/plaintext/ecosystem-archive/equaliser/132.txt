[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> this exchange is confusing me ðŸ˜¬

[20-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I think there is no minimum amount, just user minimum level

[20-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Like must be level 3 to withdraw or something

[20-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> gotta be very careful placing orders because of the extra decimal

[20-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how do kmd rewards work?

[20-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hold at least 10 in agama for at least an hour. Then it starts accruing interest.

[20-Jul-18 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> how much interest?

[20-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Dunno if it works in komodod, but you can load the keys in agama. 5 percent apr.

[20-Jul-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats alright

[20-Jul-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah. I claim mine daily so it compounds ðŸ˜Ž

[20-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
