[18-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If it was Australia it'd take about 6 months before building

[18-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there are ways around everything üòÑ

[18-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Every country and council is different

Focus Fire: Komodo (Part 1)
Think of Komodo as the crypto multiverse. Within Komodo, there can be an infinite number of ‚Äúuniverses‚Äù, each with their own laws and conventions -- interdependent, yet very much independent at the same time.

[18-Sep-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> That article is def spot on !

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've been a komodo supporter for a while now. there's a reason we took majority of our dICO in KMD.

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We need to get out and get more people in here.

[18-Sep-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> any ideas?

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> buddz and i had a conversation about EQLI in the komodo discord earlier.
not an optimal way to get people interested but there certainly are a lot of people over there that SHOULD be interested in this project

[18-Sep-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just a matter of how we get their attention

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> any of you active on Bitcointalk?

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Not that active anymore there üòí

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> im not personally, no

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> We can keep on going with the community bounties

[18-Sep-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> It‚Äôs helps

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Like saying everyone we have this bounty to upvote and retweet the same as chainzilla is doing

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe we can get jl777 into a discussion about EQLI in the komodo discord

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> We have def to be more active in Reddit

[18-Sep-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> nah I will leave James alone

[18-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> honestly thats a big part of Komodo as well, as OG's all say the same thing: he leaves stuff unfinished. I think this stigma will fade with rebranding and marketing push.

[18-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> all of the signs are there.

[18-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Dolladollaiv> Someone could ask if equaliser is using crypto conditions in the #cc channel of the kmd discord?
