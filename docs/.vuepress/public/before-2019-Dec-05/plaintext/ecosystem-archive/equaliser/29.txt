[06-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm of no faith but I have noticed an attack on christianity across the world

[06-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah I dont attack anyone for a belief. because the only way to tell who is right and wrong comes at a time where we cant tell the living.

[06-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> at the end of my life I want no excuses for what I have done.

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I respect Buddhist values, 'Live and Let live'

[06-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> all we can do is live the way we believe is right ... as long as you are not harming people of course

[06-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, and in the crypto world there are alot of fanboys that attack anything for no reason

[06-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> The band Thrice. They aren't a Christian band but some of the songs come from a "Christian mindset" it's hard to recommend anything because of how much they've changed over the years but hella talented. They use different time signatures in many songs...first three albums are (Artist in the ambulance, the illusion of safety, and first impression) are the hardest and are my favorites.

[06-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Buddha wasnt a buddhist. Jesus wasnt a christian, they all preached love......

[06-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats all over the place not just crypto world people don't have a mind of their own anymore

[06-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> dont go tearing down someone because they choose to believe in something bigger than themselves.

[06-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Atheists can believe in me lol

[06-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah I have friends from all backgrounds.. as long as they respect me I respect them.. I have had to distant myself from people before but that's just a part of life

[06-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> andy you are the Australian Jesus...

[06-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not an attack on atheists but why do they spend so much time attacking something they don't believe in?

[06-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it makes you think

[06-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist.

[06-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> or maybe it's just internet atheists lol

[06-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @CombatWombat not all of em, but yeah mostly because a lot of them have science backgrounds and a sense of superiority lol

[06-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I made a volcano once for the science fair

[06-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @CombatWombat the ignorant ones, there are many people who are able to marry science and religion

Personally, I don't know what's out there. I think something is, but who really knows. All I can do is treat people with respect

[06-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I always planned that If i visited america it would be rural. none of the tourist cities

[06-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I love the country life, which is why my town is so awesome. its small < 20k people but its a tourist town so we get millions of people here every year, but leave the city limits and it is quiet

[06-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Andy you're comin to the house and we are getting drunk and riding 4 wheelers and shooting guns.
