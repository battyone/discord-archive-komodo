[15-Sep-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <! ariewayq ! The Real Human> yeah yesterday look 15-14

[15-Sep-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Still those prices are ridiculously low so its only uphill from here

[15-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive bot a bunch down here too.

[15-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once the project gets more visibility it will go up a lot

[15-Sep-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> the founders are doing their thing...that we can see

[15-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> this is a brand new project so needs a little time to get noticed.

[15-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> imo

[15-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep completely agreed it takes time for things to get perfected and developed and even more for adoption but if things are done correctly those things will be achieved anyway

[15-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> This is a project with real utility so that‚Äôs already a huge start .

[15-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> The rest will be eventually accomplished with time .

[15-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i always have decent bids in lower also

[15-Sep-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just in case someone does somehting stupid and i can pick up more 10sats or below

[15-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> just the way i like to approach unknown things
too many years of trading stocks i guess

[15-Sep-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[15-Sep-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Bonged> Ye that‚Äôs a plus if it falls under 10 sats definitely picking up some more too :D

[15-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> That was me talking üòÑ

[15-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> oh

[15-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> was wondering where that came from

[15-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I was in telegram I didn‚Äôt realize  that I was typing in there

[15-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[15-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Too many apps open at the same time ahah

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I don‚Äôt like using exrates tho

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> me neither

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but until we have more options thats all we have

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> But well more exchanges to come in a not so distant near future I hope

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> best feature about exrates is no kyc

[15-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> lol

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> They already locked one account of mine with 100 usd on it

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> really? why

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I had to make a new one because I was logging in to many different networks they said

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And looked it because they found it suspicious

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Locked *

[15-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you using a vpn?

[15-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> still waiting for my funds to be released hopefully  by next week they said

[15-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Not always just when needed

[15-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I just access sometimes from different places but trusted ones

[15-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ah i see

[15-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> That‚Äôs why im glad I didn‚Äôt. Deposit that much in there ..

[15-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hear ya.
i see some very good size bids today 10sats and below. i know im at those levels for a bunch too but certainly some new buyers around it seems

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye we are still at 15 sats right ?

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice level up

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i see 13sats  bid- 17sats offer

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least we can get some support around those levels for now

[15-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Thanks man

[15-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agree

[15-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once cowboy make more molds ang they get some media exposure for building then things will start to move quickly. i believe

[15-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm Seeing it happen also

[15-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And that‚Äôs when we get more exposure too

[15-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üëç

[15-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> looking forward to a master node announcemnt

[15-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> people gonna be kicking themselves when that happens if they dont have enough

[15-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Someone said the minimum amount for a master ode but I don‚Äôt seem to remember

[15-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Is it 100k ?

[15-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> yes thats what they hinted at

[15-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> although it wasnt official so i guess could change

[15-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> plus they havent worked out the details yet

[15-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> prob need to get the komodo devs involved

[15-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye I see that‚Äôs really not much  seeing that you can get 100 k for so little right now

[15-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I can see already people crying for not having it that‚Äôs for sure .

[15-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right. but im guessing between the project getting more exposure and a MN announcement that we could move to 100sats very very quickly

[15-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and from what they said both are coming before the end of the yr

[15-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep  exactly and that‚Äôs nearly 10x from atm‚Äôs price which is nothing still üòÉ

[15-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> üëç

[15-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats why i personally dont mind buying a bunch of bags at these levels

[15-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> When I get my 100 usd back I look foward to be able to buy more at least under 14-15 sats üòÑ

[15-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Exactly so ..

[15-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good luck. hope u get it soon

[15-Sep-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye they said once they can verify those were secured networks they can reopen my account

[15-Sep-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And then I can get 100 k more which will make me  a happier person üòÉ

[15-Sep-18 06:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im still waiting to find out what collateral will be

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but think of it this way, when dash came out it was stupid cheap.

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> now go try to buy a dash masternode... lol

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahaha exactly

[15-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> who makes the decisions about collateral?

[15-Sep-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I do essentially.

[15-Sep-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> but I am talking with JL777 about best methods

[15-Sep-18 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> understood

[15-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so many things going on in the ecosystem im sure hes getting pulled in many directions

[15-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And we will have it implemented before the end of q4 2018?

[15-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> It‚Äôs crazy how JL777 is working in some many times at the same time and he manages to complete every single task with ease

[15-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> He/She/Them are definitely brilliant minds .

[15-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> James is a brilliant fella.

[15-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
