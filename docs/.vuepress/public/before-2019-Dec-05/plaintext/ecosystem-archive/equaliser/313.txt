[14-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm not raining all I have now, gonna save some of for the newer people that will join later on

[14-Aug-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Richard Gomez❤CG❤CFC> Thats good

[14-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think once the bounty program starts, there will be a lot more people joining. I don't want people to miss out that join later

[14-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> People that join now still have a good chance to buy EQLI on exrates too for a very cheap price

[14-Aug-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> wiil it be high again???????

[14-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> yes really HIGH

[14-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> 😛

[14-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, I think it will. There's someone, or multiple people dumping EQLI to buy back lower. But a lot of people bought it up for a low amount and will hold is. So I think we'll go up when those whales dry up

[14-Aug-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Scraping some BTC from my barrel to buy a bit more for hodl and occasional rain 😂

[14-Aug-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> Long game

[14-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> At these prices it's not hard to get even a little bit

[14-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And looking back at the sale price (50 cents I think it was) It's smart to hold 😄

[14-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, seems like he already left, I didn't even saw what he tried to post

[14-Aug-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> @Intern 1 .

Heavy persistent rain and strong winds are likely at times,  in northern, central and western areas, with the southeast probably staying dry dry for now however powerful showers are forecast in the next few hours. Next week will tend to stay windy in the north and west with a fair amount of rain here but also a few brighter and drier interludes. Following this a strong cold front is bringing heavy gale force winds and torrent of wet weather in the north, thunder will ensue and an amber warning has already been issued with a high probability of being upgraded to red. The environment agency has rated a severe warning and the army are on standby. please post gifs to help deal with this and save lives.
