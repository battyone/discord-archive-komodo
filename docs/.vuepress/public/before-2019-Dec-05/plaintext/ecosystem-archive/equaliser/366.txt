[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Go easy on me hehe

[23-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hey hey 😃 Welcome 😄

[23-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Did you type ?begin in #tipsy-begin ?

[23-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> @SwimedDragon thank you friend. Yeah just did that what level do you need for the rains lol

[23-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Once you did that, you can get xp by chatting in rooms where Tipsy bot is, and you'll eventually level up

[23-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Need to check on that

[23-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Surely i can't be that hard right?

[23-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Level 2

[23-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Nah that's not hard 😃

[23-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> How long will it take ?

[23-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't think it will take that long if you keep on chatting

[23-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Lucky i have a sweet samsung phone my hubby bought me hehehhe

[23-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think you can get 1000-1500 xp per minute if you keep chatting some

[23-Aug-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> S8 plus so donother channels have different reward structure?

[23-Aug-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure but I think the xp reward is the same for all rooms

[23-Aug-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @tipsy_dev | 2much wark Is that correct?

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Ohhh i see. Hmm should not take too long.

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> @Nashlie type `?level`

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> oh wait, sorry do that in #bot-commands

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> 😄

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Oh sorry

[23-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> So you're 31% to lvl 2

[23-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Sorry still getting the hang of these channels too

[23-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Be sure to check out the website for more info on EQLI 😃 There's also a #ama-mondays-1700-utc room where you can ask the team questions. One or more of them are online at that time in the voice channel

[23-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Oh you can check my level. Thats cool

[23-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> No worries! Just keep chatting anywhere you see Tipsy in the member list on the right you are earning XP

[23-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> I saw your command output in #bot-commands 😃

[23-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> You can do commands in #off-topic as well

[23-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you want total privacy you can also pm the bot 😃

[23-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> I have seen this panda thingy on other channels is it a little like that?

[23-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Kinda, but better 😄

[23-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Hehe cool i like it

[23-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> Bots are common in Discord. They let us extend the features however we like. Tipsy is all about levels and crypto playtime 😃

[23-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Nashlie> Playtime huh?!

[23-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | 2much wark> oh  yeah
