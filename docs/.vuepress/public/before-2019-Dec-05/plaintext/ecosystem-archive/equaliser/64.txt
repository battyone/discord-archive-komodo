[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> i try to sell to buy ... 😐

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Is it possible to deduce EQL in agama?

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> even my own 😐

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> but nothing 😐

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> 😦

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> ps somebody give me a manual ... 😐

[09-Jul-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> no succes with that

[09-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The dICO ended so there isnt any for sale at the moment. Unless someone has a sale order of their own EQL ready for atomic swap, you cant get any until we are on other exchanges.

[09-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Have you tried Hyperdex?

[09-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> on HyperDEX nothing 😐

[09-Jul-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And your coin has to be activated in native mode.

[09-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> I have a number of equalizers on the balance in the discord
Can I bring them to my agama?

[09-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> only time you need to use param for example if the coin you are activating doesnt sync the entire chain to latest block, rescan is helpful.

[09-Jul-18 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yes you can.

[09-Jul-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> go to tipsy in DM and type command ?withdraw she will explain

[09-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> yeap @cypherzero

[09-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!!!👾 👽 Thorth 👽 👾!!!> u can 😃

[09-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @tanya when people say they will do something tomorrow or will do something later, that saying correlates to that. "tomorrow never comes" because as humans, we are good at procrastinating and putting things off lol. sorry I thing I am distracting you. I challenge you to close discord for 1 hour and I will tip you 1
