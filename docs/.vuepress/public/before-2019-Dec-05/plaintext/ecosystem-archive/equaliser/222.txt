[dscrdeql] <hanson24> woooot

[29-Jul-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Working on it. There was a fork earlier after all. It's resolved, but not everything is put back together yet. For some reason, the servers decided they didn't want to go past block 61611.

[29-Jul-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> That reason turns out to be that there's been one more update to komodod than I thought.. I'm on the right one now 😛 Komodo team works faster than I can keep up with some times. All will be resolved and working within a few hours.

[29-Jul-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ah ok cool thanks @Biomech-Founder let me know when its done please thanks 😄

[29-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> If I'm still awake when it syncs up, I'll post in here. But it'll come live on it's own when it's reindexed 😄

[29-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hopefully pretty quickly. Been at this all day. Kind of tired of looking at it.

[29-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ok sweet will check it a bit later then thanks

[29-Jul-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Good night 💤 everybody

[29-Jul-18 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Wanna shout out, once again, to the KMD team. I would never have figured this mess out without their able and friendly assistance.

[29-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> so far, the seed node is fully fixed, the explorer is resynching, and the SPV servers are still compiling the new daemon. All will be well by morning, and the 'fork' affected very little aside from my sanity. It pretty much just froze, and the notary system worked as intended and banned the misbehaving nodes. Unfortunately, they were our official nodes. Keep this as a lesson. Don't be like me. If you're running something on the KMD platform, keep up with the updates. They literally happen daily, but weekly is usually good enough 😄
