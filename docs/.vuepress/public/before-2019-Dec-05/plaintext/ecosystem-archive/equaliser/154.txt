[23-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But the idea of someone paying 0.000015 btc for a coin and selling for 0.00000002 btc just 3 days on market do not add up at all

[23-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> Yeah something's off

[23-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Acura> Does anybody know if Exrates have Withdraw Problems of EQL ??

[23-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have orders to withdraw in but no confirmed withdraws

[23-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They seem to have withdraw issues all the way around

[23-Jul-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Acura> Thanks for Feedback. I get:  Unfortunately, the operation is not available at the moment

[23-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I can only go by what they are telling us. Also it was the weekend and they dont work weekends apparently

[23-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> seeing as you guys are in contact with them I thought maybe you might have an idea

[23-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no need to be a smart ass about it mate

[23-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Sorry if thats what you think however, i am just repeating what they told us and others that have contacted support.

[23-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> you posted a message to everyone suggesting they take coins off exrates till everything is sorted

[23-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> my withdrawal got processed but it was only a small amount.. I always test it out first.. I tried withdrawing wallet is off line so I asked you if you know why

[23-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I don't think I asked anything wrong

[23-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Cowboy crypto posted the message, I just woke up so Im getting up to speed üëç

[23-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> jeez, I'm gonna hope they get working on it when the weekend is finished.

[23-Jul-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> oh i missed out on an interesting conversation earlier üòÆ

[23-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, numbers dont add up. I have no idea what the hell is going on

[23-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I should of withdrew all but I always do a small test first

[23-Jul-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i got a fair bit on there now but hey if they weren't going to let me withdraw they wouldn't of done the first one

[23-Jul-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üòÑ

[23-Jul-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think it will come good eventually. exchange has been around 2 years I think I saw mentioned at one stage.

[23-Jul-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep that was me

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> thats the positive about the exchange.... it's been around since 2016

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i was talking about the other convo though üòÇ

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i was here for most of the exrates talk

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> what food convo? lol

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no the one about religion

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> few foodies in here

[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> was only a short convo

[23-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I would debate Biomech üí™ ü§ì LOL

[23-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> He's great to converse with

[23-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah he does seem good to converse with

[23-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> reasonable

[23-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There was a bit of bacon talk too after haha, it's the greatest. I believe the most consumed meat in the world. I once invested in a company that makes a medicine to substitute antibiotics and it's made from the pineapple root.

[23-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[23-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I'm not a fan of bacon üò¨

[23-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> made about 500%

[23-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> no way, bacon is the greatest. It can get greasy but short cut without fat is still good

[23-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> moderation is best though,

[23-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i don't mind it but i don't go out of my way to eat it

[23-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i don't eat MacDonalds either

[23-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah mcdonalds is quite tasteless to me.
