[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> thanks. I am almost back to a point where I can get to the public end of things with this

[14-Sep-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Nice one  @CowboyCrypto

[14-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I may have to hire some help

[14-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 2 hours a day is all I need them for the rest is waiting for the blocks to cure lol

[14-Sep-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> How many blocks will you be making

[14-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Currently I am pouring 1 a day with different blends.

[14-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> once i get it down to a science, I hope to be pouring 5-6 a day.

[14-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> this will basically be a wall a day lol

[14-Sep-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If it takes off, I will set up a warehouse capable of making 100 a day or more

[14-Sep-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> edit if to WHEN :EQLI:

[14-Sep-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Whoa, that'd be awesome

[14-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Hello everyone!! Back from a trip!

[14-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> could even end up producing them and selling them to other builders

[14-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hi there @MassimoStyle

[14-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hope the trip was good

[14-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's sat morning here

[14-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> 6am

[14-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> gonna be a sunny nice day

[14-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Hello! @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ

[14-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> The trip was good

[14-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @CowboyCrypto- Founder  be interesitng to know the weight of the bricks and size

[14-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Jelly thats one part of the plan.

[14-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> from the photo they look about 700ml long and 40 ml wide

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> probably weigh around 5kg

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> i'm guessing

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Block size when we produce them will be 24x24x60

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> These are all just test blocks to get data

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> thats in inches

[14-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yes, understand

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> inches....they're going to be very big then

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so 5 ft x 2ft x 2 ft

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> huge...

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> makes it easier to create a wall quickly

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exactly ðŸ˜„

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so easily put up a number of walls in a day

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> means other builders can buy less blocks, saving money.

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> should be able to build a 1500 sq ft home in a day

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> dried in

[14-Sep-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> create the "Equaliser Block"

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> buy from you local Equaliser warehouse

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If i end up having to do it myself, then it will take me roughly a week.

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> or shipped to bguilding site

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I image foundations will have to be very good

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im looking at warehouses in Puerto Rico and here locally to where I am in Missouri.

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> any movement in the foundations or 'settling' of them could easy cause cracks

[14-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Here;s the kicker on foundations

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but then if they're so light, then maybe not

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'll use regular concrete to pour those but use the same forms.

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so that we have no issues with code or engineering approval.

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yes, i thought you'd have to use regular concrete for the foundations

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> then they all just kind of stack together like legos

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> gotta get it inspected as well by local authorities before pour to check steel, etc

[14-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but they have to be storng

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hahahaha.....yes aircrete lego

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh I am well aware of the process lol its a pain in the ass to be honest.

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> you could even shape them like lego

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they will be

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> make it easier

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> have you not seen the forms we are getting?

[14-Sep-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> no,  where can I see them?

[14-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> blocks will come out something like this

[14-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> with two matching slots on bottom to lay them straight everytime.

[14-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if they are too heavy then I will get a small loading crane rented to hoist them in and call a friend to guide me.

[14-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> OMG, they're awesome

[14-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> hahaha...just like huge lego blocks

[14-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> love the side surface as well.

[14-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> looks like a sandstone surface

[14-Sep-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> well done

[14-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they will be like that but much larger

[14-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will take a while unless the markets bounce back nicely, as I am doing the building with help from those around me here. Luckily I am blessed in that department.

[14-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> the forms ordered are 350lbs each

[14-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I was just thinking, are those shapes for the blocks 'copyright' or something like that so you have to be careful creating your own ones? or don't have to worry about that?
