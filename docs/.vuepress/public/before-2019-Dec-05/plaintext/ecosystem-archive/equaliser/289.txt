[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> good morning

[11-Aug-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Is there a chance that Equaliser will get listed on CMC (coin market cap)?

[11-Aug-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont see why not

[11-Aug-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When? it's at their discretion unfortunately.

[11-Aug-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Us *

[11-Aug-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I thought maybe Equaliser would have to pay CMC to list it

[11-Aug-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Has EQualiser put a submission into CMC?

[11-Aug-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> CowboyCrypto handles that stuff.

[11-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I don‚Äôt know if you need to pay them to be exact or you need to be some specific requirements

[11-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> yeah a certain amount of volume is required and obviously exchanges that are listed on cmc

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm hoping market drops to about 5k for Btc and runs that for a month

[11-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If that happens we are going to be set up nicely

[11-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> Let it fall.
I placed orders, even lower.
And forgot about the exchange

[11-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> probably a good strategy.

[11-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> would rather see btc hold support at 5.8-6k at least then we know what the bottom is üòÉ

[11-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The bottom is zero. But the dollar will get there first üòÑ

[11-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> would rather see btc hold support at 5.8-6k at least then we know we have really strong support there üòÉ
