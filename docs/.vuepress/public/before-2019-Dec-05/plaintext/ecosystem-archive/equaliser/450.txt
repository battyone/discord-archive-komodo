[19-Sep-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> right

[19-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thing is for people intersted in a MN even paying todays prices its SOOO cheap

[19-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep it is just stating a fact that now its getting more and more expensive and its gonna get even more.

[19-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> when we reach 100 sats. 1 k sats it wont be as cheap 😉

[19-Sep-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 📈 :EQLI:

[19-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> you would only need to spend 500 euros now to have  enough eqli to run a MN..

[19-Sep-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so appealing to any newcomer i would think

[19-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i have big plans for my MN's :vote_up: 💯

[19-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed when people get awareness about this , people wil rush for those MN'S

[19-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> you are a whale @c2k 😄

[19-Sep-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> whale of EQLI

[19-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nah, just a top 20 guy
i think there has been an increased attempt to spread the word recently...which is encouraging

[19-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it will benefit all of us to help get this project awareness

[19-Sep-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> as Myself

[19-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep I spread the word to close friends I have to start talking about this at work

[19-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> xD

[19-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I even conviced my gf to invest she just need to give me the money and will take care of rest ahah

[19-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> that sounds dangerous. lolol

[19-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> lol

[19-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I'm an accountant part time

[19-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> she has nothing to worry about

[19-Sep-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Im only 25 tho

[19-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> plenty of time to cook the books 😂 😜

[19-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> jk

[19-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> My gf is going to school for that, any advice for her? @Buddz1993

[19-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> well I would say its intense work and the first year of university you can really waste a lot of time if you dont focus on the important topics , thats what happened to me and then I had to compensate studying 2x times because of the 1st semester I wasted going to parties and stuff

[19-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> altough I only did 3 years of university didint finish my masters thats why I only work part time here and then

[19-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I had to go and pay nearly 100k in a loan to get a pilot's license xD

[19-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats why I found crypto to pay off for this big loan I had to take.

[19-Sep-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> still waiting for it ofc

[19-Sep-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> sorry for extending myself but its the truth lol

[19-Sep-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> lol No worries. You'll get there, first year of my BS was a waste too until I actually got into my actual computer science courses - I was fortunate enough to go to a cheap school with a great program.

[19-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yep I think we all have that stage where everything is new and we just want to fit in and have fun, but then we realize that we dont need to do those things in order for us to be sucessful and achieve what we want .. , that's why as soon as I finished my uni degree I had to change my life and start doing the ATPL which gave a completly different perspective of life and I dont regret a single thing of it

[19-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> ATPL?

[19-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> altough 100k loan to be paid in 10 years time its  tough

[19-Sep-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> airline transport pilot license

[19-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Ah ok

[19-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Yeah 100k is a freakin house lol

[19-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye LOL

[19-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> thats waht my parents said when i did that

[19-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> My total was about 13k for school

[19-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> But I know that I wil pay it in less than 10 years so I'm cool with it

[19-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Good deal

[19-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ye my uni degree was about 3-5 k

[19-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> relatively cheap I would say

[19-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but I studied in a public university so

[19-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> and why pay a 100 k for a house when I can pay in the future with EQLI?

[19-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I should have said that to my parents

[19-Sep-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763

Kids knocked it over and it busted it. but at 2 days in of 28 total and you can see how this Mix takes a 5lb sledge. When I’m done with the final mix these blocks will be tougher than a Detroit hooker. https://t.co/nmxaM9u1uC

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if you guys are interested to see how the stress testing goes.

[19-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it cracked on about the 8th swing but it hasnt been drying that long at all...

[19-Sep-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol Im going to break a lot of blocks in the coming month

[19-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Hell yeah @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[19-Sep-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That had only been curing for 2 days? No wonder the sledge sunk in haha

[19-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> sinks in regardless. its mostly air

[19-Sep-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I can do one on some cured stuff too it does the same thing

[19-Sep-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> aggregate mix will just crumble under a swing.

[19-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im enjoying working with it.

[19-Sep-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wont be testing the impact strength again for a while but this one already got busted so I figured i would mess around.

[19-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Seems like it would be fun, testing different formulas and doing some destructive testing

[19-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah it is therapy honestly lol

[19-Sep-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> waiting my my fiber to get in so i can do some real testing on this and get these blocks cookin up.

[19-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> in theory I can make 2 blocks a day per from.

[19-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> form

[19-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> so with 10 forms, 20 blocks a day, thats a house produced in a week with 28 days to cure.

[19-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Fiber to mix with the concrete?

[19-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah

[19-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> reduces cracking, increases tensile strength

[19-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I had a driveway poured with that stuff, the builder said it removed the need of rebar. I was a little skeptical

[19-Sep-18 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if you have the right mix then it does.

[19-Sep-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Screw a brick house - this is the future

[19-Sep-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im trying to get a meeting wiht the pensmores as they have helix.

[19-Sep-18 08:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pensmore Mansion is the largest house in the US and is able to withstand a direct nuclear blast they say.

[19-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and its about 15 minutes from where I am sitting.

[19-Sep-18 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> A direct nuclear blast? Sounds impressive
