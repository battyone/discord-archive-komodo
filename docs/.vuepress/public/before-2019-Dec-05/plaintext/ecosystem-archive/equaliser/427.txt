[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> interesting quote

[14-Sep-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @✌Jellysmash✌ re your employer - you could show them the MNZ whitepaper and see what they say - they will not be surviving long in the payments industry without understanding where it is headed - also look at Revolut (as an example of how not to do things) but as a real world payments platform marketing to the next generations...

[14-Sep-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yes, that's probably true

[14-Sep-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I"ve already tried a number of times

[14-Sep-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> It's quite nice out today 😃

[14-Sep-18 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> good to hear

[14-Sep-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> stay safe regardless

[14-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Looks like exrates had a bit of action

[14-Sep-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 1586627.053528567 Total coins for sale on exrates... That is all that there is for sale on there. this is a great sign honestly as most people are hodling as we push forward.

[14-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pretty awesome honestly.

[14-Sep-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Very nice

[14-Sep-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> agreed @CowboyCrypto- Founder and the sizes of the bids are much larger than the sizes of the offers. good stuff

[14-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> id' be expecting the sale books on exrate would be getting smaller as more people decide to hodl

[14-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it is a good sign

[14-Sep-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> sign of confidence in the project

[14-Sep-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> once some serious fomo sets in, it's gonna go crazy

[14-Sep-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Let's hope we get an extra exchange for that too

[14-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> @CowboyCrypto- Founder The exchanges you are in talks with, do they ask btc to be listed or an EQLI amount?

[14-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> almost all ask for btc

[14-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> unless htey have a coin of their own like cryptopia

[14-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> or binance

[14-Sep-18 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, btc is king with the exchanges

[14-Sep-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wish I could still buy more

[14-Sep-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
