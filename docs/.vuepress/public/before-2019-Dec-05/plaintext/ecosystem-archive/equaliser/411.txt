[07-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It was a super competitive tough game

[07-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Great to watch

[07-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Did you watch any of it  @AndronicusBass

[07-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont have a tv antenna LOL

[07-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> If i get time to watch anything it's often on the state of economies and housing around the world. One of my go to websites for economic news is macrobusiness.com.au it's quite objective and excellent narrative

[07-Sep-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Noice

[07-Sep-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Friday arvo here as well

[07-Sep-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> End of work week

[07-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Also, going for my atmospheric gas testing certification. This is handy in the event if we ever have to work with septic systems on any builds, I can ensure the environment is safe and no air quality issues around the build 👍

[07-Sep-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> As well as ensuring the air quality inside domes while finishing the interior, wont cause any issues. There will be places we build that will have legislation around safety in the workplace

[07-Sep-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Good certification to get

[07-Sep-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Hope you get out easily enough

[07-Sep-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I have a strong interest in OH&S, I'll soak it up like a sponge. I've had gas testing experience as well 🙂

[07-Sep-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It would be cool to educate people in workplace safety and mitigation techniques in developing countries that have accidents quite often

[07-Sep-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yes, I've seen some pretty shoddy and dangerous work practices overseas

[07-Sep-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> eg like in indonesia

[07-Sep-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> BTW, I contacted coingecko to correct our ticker https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/equaliser

[07-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just need to persuade exrates to do the same

[07-Sep-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah, its strict here however, there were some deaths from building the adelaide hospital. It seems you can learn important information but without common sense, its useless

[dscrdeql] <c2k> i dont know the laws where you live but if you cant afford a lawyer some lawyers will do "pro-bono" work or offer to take a % of your settlement.

[07-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> Have contacted plenty and its too big for them too teake and its very few in sweden that do pro-bono
