[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not the song, maybe...

[19-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Sounds Marilyn Manson to me

[19-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> He was a kid.

[19-Aug-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I know, he's my age 😄

[19-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, he'd have been 21.

Judas Priest- All Guns Blazing with lyrics
Twisting the strangle grip Won't give no mercy Feeling those tendons rip Torn up and mean Blastmaster racks the ground Bent on survival Full throttle hammers...

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Rob Halford is an amazing singer. He has such a weird voice, people don't realize how fucking good he really is.

[19-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <spydr> Nope, wouldn't have known that one.

[19-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And he can still do that scream 😄

[19-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Rob Halford May be an amazing singer but Evan Holford is a beast beyond measure! 😂😂

[19-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> Here comes a creepy 😂

[19-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The beast from the east vs. the beast from the south....

[19-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 😂😂😂😂

[19-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <akomismo> 👋

[19-Aug-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Never bet against a southern fella with a good heart.

[19-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Damn straight @CowboyCrypto- Founder 👍

[19-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can't pick no sides... My mom's from Tennesee and my Dad's from oregon 😛

[19-Aug-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Let’s pray for sideways action the next few days and a dip down to 5300 on btc lol

[19-Aug-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Gives me a few days to flip some cars and buy back cheap lol

[19-Aug-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> True capitulation

[19-Aug-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> I for one am ready to scoop up some cheap crypto

[19-Aug-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I have casual work in mining, cant wait for my next assignment to get more fiat, buy the lows

[19-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> A lot of people scared off crypto at the moment I see it as a great opportunity to buy at discounted prices

[19-Aug-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful

[19-Aug-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think its a bait and switch by big money, stock markets propped up like a weekend at burnie's and precious metal down as well as crypto.

[19-Aug-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
