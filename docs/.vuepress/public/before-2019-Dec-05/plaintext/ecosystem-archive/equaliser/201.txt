[27-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> apparently 40 drivers at my company didn't know what  a cubit was either .

[27-Jul-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> it's no wonder someone with no experience like me got done with the 4 week training program in 2 weeks .. While others who have been driving for years took 4 weeks to complete. .

[27-Jul-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan> I don't know what that is, I know what a qbit (quantum bit) is though
