[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> now I can

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> worth installing the latest

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it did an uninstall first though

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I always get a bit nervous during the uninstall

[29-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but no problems

[29-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> was able to reinstall fine

[29-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I thought I'd move my KMD from ledger to agama

[29-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> just so I could get the rewards

[29-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and it couldn't link up to the blockchain

[29-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so I was stuck

[29-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I couldn't sync so I didn't want to risk sending kmd to the agama wallet

[29-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> what I thought is different to other coins is that the agama generated the same key for eqli as for kmd

[29-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so they must be at the exact same address

[29-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> coexisting

[29-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I tried 5 kmd first just to make sure it went through smoothly

[29-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> then it seemed to work to sent the rest

[29-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I checked that both eqli and kmd are in there

[29-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> at the same address

[29-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but agama seems to be able to sort it out and keep track of both

[29-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so, anyone else that may be wondering if it's normal to have the same address for eqli as well as kmd...yes it's normal

[29-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and just works that way

[29-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> the ledger didn't give the kmd rewards i found out

[29-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> don't know when the ledger will offer that support either

[29-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so if you want the 5% rewards you have to move to a 'recognised' by komodo wallet

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you have to let the Agama wallet open for that 5%?

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's a bit like staking the coin

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> not that I know of

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or can you just keep it close and get rewards in a month?

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> just move you kmd to the wallet and it happens automatically

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> no you don't need to have teh wallet open

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> For some other coins I prefer a staking pool because I can't keep my pc on all the time and I have not enough coins for a descent stake

[29-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's a bit different to other staking coins

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Nice ðŸ˜ƒ

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's like a reward just for having kmd at that address

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yea, it's nice

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> dont know of any other coins that do it like that

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and so people accumulate kmd

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> good way to get people to buy kmd and hodl it

[29-Aug-18 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, I came across a coin today while reading something, not sure what the name was. Could have been something like fieldcoin

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> yea, so many weird coins around

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> seems like everyday I'm spammed on discord with an invite to some other coin

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im always getting them lol

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> there literlally must be thousands of them

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm finding them so annoying there's so man

[29-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> y

[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's surprising how many new coins with no purpose are being created

[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have been on a few coins teams so its nothing new to me

[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's what i like about eqli

[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it has a purpose

[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm glad you're backing a winner here @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> noice

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> gotta back the right horse

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> liek the melbourne cup

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> like

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol it better be, I spent a long time bringing this to reality and picking a good team

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I haven't read anything much about that fieldcoin but it has to do something with owning land and stuff like that

[29-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> i think there's a beercoin, sexcoin, hashcoin, adultcoin,,etc,etc

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> a coin for everyname but with only one 'purpose'

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> as a store of value

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Homecoin was the original name of this one.

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and the likelyhood of it ever being used as a payment system is remote

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I like Homecoin

[29-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's a great name

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Equaliser is also good, as it's non-discriminative

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's how the white-paper terms it

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> which makes sense

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> being the great equaliser

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> means anyone can get a home

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> equaliser is more branded

[29-Aug-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> affordable

[29-Aug-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and will be availabe to everyone

[29-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> looks liek tipsy might be down

[29-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Fieldcoin's slogan say's ''Creating the first blockchain based land marketplace''
Like I said, I haven't read anything more about it but the website page at the moment, but can that coin be a potential partner if it is a good one? Not even sure if I should post this here or somewhere else

[29-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> the bot commands aren't working

[29-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> @SwimedDragon so based on land title maybe

[29-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> !restart

[29-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> !restart

[29-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I'm now getting an error on the agama wallet for EQLI - Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server...

[29-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> both don't seem to be able to connect

[29-Aug-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> probably just a connection issue

[29-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> the coins are still at that address according to the http://explore-equaliser.io

[29-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> same for kmd

[29-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it was working just a few minutes ago

[29-Aug-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> yep i just withdrew from exrates

[29-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> the  withdrawal  process is manual

[29-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so exrates won't do it for a while

[29-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so should be ok by then

[29-Aug-18 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> got it earlier

[29-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> was quick this time within 30 mins ðŸ˜„

[29-Aug-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Server issue cleared up for me in agama

[29-Aug-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
