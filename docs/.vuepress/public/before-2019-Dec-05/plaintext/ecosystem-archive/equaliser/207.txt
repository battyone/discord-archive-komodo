[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Most masternodes (that i have used) tanked after the release of masternodes. The projects seem to just live off the old "dont let your coins sit there, build a masternode". Kind of... let your money make money scheme ... and the think people will keep buying into that and the price will moon. But actually the more masternodes online, the less they receive for reward....

[27-Jul-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> In turn, MN holders start selling of the coins they earned at whatever, until the price drops so low they end up selling the masternode staked coins....any thoughts on how to overcome this trend?

[27-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Without going into too many details, we understand our supply and we offer something no one else does.

[27-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> With homes going up, we can essentially lock the vast majority of our coins.

[27-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And a lot of the scenario you just spoke of comes from coins with nothing more to offer than a masternode

[27-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ya

[27-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> So of course ppl are going to continuously dump as they get rewarded

[27-Jul-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If they have nothing else to hold for

[27-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> But some have been masternodes of exchanges that also receive a portion of the exchange fees. So, double incentive (stakes and fees)

[27-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Just trying to give as close to an apples to apples exsmple

[27-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I can give a counter example. DASH.

[27-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But here‚Äôs the thing, we essentially are all investors, right?  We are all trying to make money to buy things

[27-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I was leading up to that lol

[27-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> LOL

[27-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> unless i missed it, i didnt see mention of MN's on roadmap. when do u guys plan on offering MN's and what will be the EQL requirement?

[27-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ^known unkown

[27-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm pretty sure the original Mastercoin is dead as the dodo, but the concept worked.

[27-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We didn‚Äôt put it on there because it was unknown at the time we were writing the wp

[27-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It wasn't on the original roadmap. We always were discussing it, but hadn't decided whether to do it.

[27-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If it could be done

[27-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We had mixed thoughts on it

[27-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Komodo platform is rapidly evolving, so we tabled it and kept bringing it up. I think every time it got 'tabled', it came up again about a week later. So we came to the agreement that we were interested.

[27-Jul-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But back to my explanation. Most investors take profits and reinvest into other coins, cars, jewelry or real estate.

[dscrdeql] <c2k> ty

[27-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We have the ability to provide the last one without need of fiat conversion

[27-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> interesting MN conversation
although a little over my head

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you will eventually understand it @MassimoStyle

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> üëç

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once you get into crypto more. we all started somewhere

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Well that was well put  @CowboyCrypto

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> üëç

[27-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Masternodes are basically where users lock up a predetermined amount of coins in exchange for rewards massimo

[27-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Ok

[27-Jul-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> And the only time you will ever see "locked up" and "rewards" in the same sentence

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> when you regret going home from work

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Because at work there is aircon

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Thanks üôè  EQL is actually the first coin ive looked at after KMD

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> And at home its 30¬∞ inside

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Aircon = A/C...i get it lol

[27-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok just throwing numbers out there so don‚Äôt put anything into this: our circulating supply is around 50 million. Say a masternode is 50k eql and we max it at 1000 masternodes

[27-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> That blows  @Cryptoon

[27-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ...1000 seems like a good #....

[27-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Well then 100% of our circulating supply is locked and it‚Äôs essentially up to the holders of what they want to set price at

[27-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Dash is the best example

[27-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats not efficient is it

[27-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Nope

[27-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 2400 usd  when they launched for a masternode. Now a dash masternode is around 250k usd

[27-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> wouldnt you only want a certain %age of coins available for lockup inMN?

[27-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I was just using it as an example

[27-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I didn't know there could be a set amount of max masternodes on a coin

[27-Jul-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it can be limited. Just has to be written into the code

[27-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Hmm

[27-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ive seen it on other coins unless I dreamed that up lol

[27-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> whats a solid MN number for security?

[27-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs all relevant to the coins stats

[27-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> What will be the usecase for MN?

[27-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> For other coins it's security and decision making I think

[27-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> 500 MNs at 50k would be 50% of circulation?

[27-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But for EQL you already have DPOW?

[27-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> So security meh

[27-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Further securing and decentralization of the network

[27-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <akomismo0> Sup

[27-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Sup

[27-Jul-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <akomismo0> Cowboy hey

[27-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <akomismo0> üëç

[27-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Like I said I can‚Äôt go too deep into it, but I‚Äôm excited to be honest

[27-Jul-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> and the reward structure for mn?

[27-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I can‚Äôt say yet lol

[27-Jul-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> id be in a MN ...although 50k may be a bit much for me

[27-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.002 btc right now at the 50k number lol

[27-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> On exrates

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but exrates is not accurate becaue of the puking whale

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The coins come back to your wallet

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and no one can log into buy them lol

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> you can I think?

[27-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I myself have bought millions from whoever is dumping

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> you guys know who the whale must be no?

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> No clue

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They must‚Äôve bought on bdex

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 50M supply, and you know who bought in private sale

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> so you can check the addy's?

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôve cross referenced my sales logs

[27-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Everyone still has coins sitting in their wallets

[27-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It makes no sense financially

[27-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> My girlfriend scooped up 250k coins for 20 bucks

[27-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I found out by accident

[27-Jul-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> She got to asking questions

[27-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> is it possible someone created a shitload of coins?

[27-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've bought back close to a million.

[27-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That was our first thought

[27-Jul-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But the coins are coming back to the wallet and no new chain.

[27-Jul-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No, it's not. check the block explorer. If they did, it would have caused a fork or showed a higher total balance. There's a variance of around 13 coins, 10 of which are real, but that's a known flaw of the calculation method that's generic to all block explorers with the possible exception of Insight.

[27-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.01 coin are created at every block so our coin supply will go up some but not much

[27-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> 0.001

[27-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And yeah, that was our first thought. The other was that the exchange was creating them on a balance sheet. But to cover withdraws they would have had to buy at market if that was the case, and they haven't.

[27-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Oh, I had forgotten that part üòÑ

[27-Jul-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Part of our ongoing masternode plans. We put it in place to be possible from day one.
