[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hey I finally got some btc into exrates. See that the lowest buy is 16 SATs and sells are at 168. Does exrates penalize you if you cancel an order? Want to get a low ball order in but if it never fills I want to cancel w/o penalties

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Good night fellows

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no they dont penalize you

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> In staying asleep

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you just need to go to the "orders" tab and cxl it

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> no penalty

[13-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Steve10

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there are plenty of bids lower.

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> we were talking a lot about it a few hrs ago

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> how people are looking to scoop up 6-7figs 10sats or below

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Ok thanks. What's the chances of those 16 and under being filled? Seems hard to imagine them being filled

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so my guess is it doesnt get there

[13-Aug-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> can leeave it in for a few hours and see what happens

[13-Aug-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> cant imagine if you dont buy them you would have to pay more than 20sats to get filled

[13-Aug-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> üëç

[13-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Aug-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Top 100 will to achieve level 5 get flooded with rain for 24 hours I think

[14-Aug-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> now that buddz is at level 5

[14-Aug-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <c2k> somwhow this new setup caused a rainstorm

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> people cant stop raining

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I need to get to level 15

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> üòÑ

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i was just kidding buddz

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üöÄüìàedskyüìâü§Ø> Its good yah

[14-Aug-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> for sure...and fast üëå

[14-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> But this system has improved things

[14-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> In my opinion

[14-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> What kind of changes did we get?

[14-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> if it gets more people involved then yes

[14-Aug-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @RyanInSiam the founders moved everyone back to level 1

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and started over

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and are giving "rain" incentives

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> once you reach level 5

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Yeah, that much I saw.

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> so some of us still have "titles"

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Was just curious what other changes to the system there were?

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> but we all start over on level 1

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep exactly like she said

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think it's a very interesting way

[14-Aug-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[14-Aug-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
