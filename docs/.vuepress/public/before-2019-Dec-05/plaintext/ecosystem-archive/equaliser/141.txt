[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> 👋 👋

[21-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> withdrawals not working on exrates yet? 😮

[21-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> as of ten minutes ago, no.

[21-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I hope their tech team works weekends 😛

[21-Jul-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As of late last night (which was early morning in Istanbul), they said they were fixing it.

[21-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ah ok well i got some cheap equaliser but i dont like leaving on exchanges 😦

[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> morning @NWhiskeyTango  ☕

[21-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I fully understand @CombatWombat . I'm of the mind to wait myself. There's a pretty severe time zone gap between the team and Exrates 😄 But they've been responsive to everything we've asked of them. Not necessarily fast, but they're at least talking to us.

[21-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> OTOH, when it does open, the cheap stuff is going to go away fast. We'll keep abreast of it as best we are able, and when it's open, we'll announce it here and on our other social media.

[21-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They listed us earlier than they had guaranteed, so I kind of expected a few speed bumps.

[21-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' @!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽

[dscrdeql] <cypherzero> Beer in the fridge.
Difficult days without football 😃

[21-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not I. I like my coffee thick. Black coffee is like raw chocolate to me. Unfinished.

[21-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> football doesn't interest me much. Used to, but I'm too small to play, and if I'm gonna watch guys beat the shit out of each other, I'd rather watch UFC 😄

[21-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> UFC ?

[21-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[21-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Where skill matters more than size 😄

[21-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @CombatWombat your screen name wouldn't be related to a certain nasty little critter in Magic: The Gathering, would it?

[21-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> My third cup of joe is finally revving up the brain cells 😄 La Cafe es La Vida.

[21-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha nope

[21-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Withdraws open yet kev?

[21-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m still in bed lol

[21-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> lookin' like it, as of now. I'm testing, will report back in minutes 😄

[21-Jul-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, just initiated a withdrawal. It has confirmed on their site as being in process. I'll let y'all know when it arrives 😄

[21-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’ll be a while more than likely

[21-Jul-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In the meantime, the confirmation settings are a little odd. You have to have a "financial password" set under your settings.

[21-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok I am gonna hop on that in a bit

[21-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> The one complaint I consistently saw about exrates was slow withdrawals, so I'm gonna go do some housework and fake patience. It's in process, which is progress 😄

[21-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hello alll

[21-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> hi maano

[21-Jul-18 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 👋🏽

[21-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> So far it's just saying "reserved on withdraw", but it gave no hassle. I think it's all good.

[21-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' 'mano

[21-Jul-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> should be all good though

[21-Jul-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If I were designing an exchange I’d make sure money got in and out fast

[21-Jul-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> @CowboyCrypto agreed. My pet peeve is slow deposits and withdraw

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s annoying for sure

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> if only there was an exchange

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Where funds went directly to and from your wallet

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That would be nice

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> 😜

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> lol, thats barterdex

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That exchange is not ready for mainstream

[21-Jul-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Lol if only hahaha

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Hey I'm moving up in the world...

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Hehe I'm using barterdex to pick me up some stuff as we speak :p

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> DEX's are a great idea. Current implementations range from meh to awful. That day will come...

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Level 3!!

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Yeah sure

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Slight learning curve but legit af

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> high fees to withdraw

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 😱

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Once the new marketmaker will be released for barterdex and hyper

[21-Jul-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Shit should be ready for mainstream adoption tbh

[21-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> We ran into a lot of issues along our journey with bdex

[21-Jul-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I hope so. I'm totally behind the project, but as a trader, I can't say it's good.

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In its current state.

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @CombatWombat where the fees at to withdraw?

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> For the dICO's I've invested in I've always used barterdex

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Once the dApp for a smaller amount

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> If you know the utxo sizes etc it's easy

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> But I understand why a lot of people struggle

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @AndronicusBass-Founder to withdraw 1000 they take 22

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> not sure the exact fees

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> That's steep

[21-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> On exrates?

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Jeeeesus lol

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> You withdraw 1000.00000000 EQL through the payment system EQL

Exchange Fee will be : 5.00000000 EQL (0.5%)

Merchant Fee will be : 17.0 EQL (0.5%, but not less than 17 EQL)

Amount to be enrolled : 978 EQL

Total Fee : 22 EQL

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> Cant be to cover tx fees lol

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> What is a merchant fee?

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no idea lol

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Idk

[21-Jul-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> A fee to be able to charge fees probably :p

[21-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Well I’m gonna hate to see how many they get off me 😂😂

[21-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Oh, thought you meant barterdex haha. That is solid af

[21-Jul-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yeah, exrates withdraw is a bit steep. I hope they're using it to improve their infrastructure.

[21-Jul-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> not as bad as livecoin though

[21-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> There is that 😛 Those guys are expensive.

[21-Jul-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ah well. sooner or later we'll be on multiple exchanges. You have to start somewhere.

[21-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Top 40 is a good start I think lol

[21-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> For sure

[21-Jul-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They are very responsive to requests

[21-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cryptoon> have you contacted Ronnie Moas about EQL yet?

[21-Jul-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Who is that?
