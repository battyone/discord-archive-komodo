[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> The past few days have been a bore...I need to live vicariously through others...

[dscrdeql] <aFastHero> Though that seems to happen a lot when one returns from a vacation. There isnt much that can compete with a nice vacay.

[11-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Brown rice takes a while to cook

[11-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> 3-4X more time than white rice

[11-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jul-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jul-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Didn't like the white ones

[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I love shrimp

[11-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Nice grilled prawns

[11-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> It's very easy to cook

[11-Jul-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Just add couple of spoons of plain Greek yougurt and salt, pepper and turmeric powder. A spoon of olive oil on top. Mix it all together and keep for 10-15 minutes, then 10 minutes in the oven

[11-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Tossed once and ready

[11-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Sounds phenomenal

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Ready in 30-40 minutes

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> What is everyones opinion on the most healthy oil to use for cooking?

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Olive oil canola oil coconut oil

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Maybe no oil

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I've been using olive oil

[11-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> For years now

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That‚Äôs a little fatty tho

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I use very little anyways

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> And I‚Äôm not talking about my joint

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> ü§óü§ü

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I use olive oil or regular vegetable oil

[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> What's your preference?

[11-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I was going to try coconut oil but there‚Äôs a lot of fat in it

[11-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> All oils have fats lol

[11-Jul-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> I'm kind of used to the flavour of olive oil

[11-Jul-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> If I switch to some other, I can immediately notice the difference

[11-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @donaldmathers good fats. body still needs fats

[11-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> just not the processed ones

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> anyone ever tried rice bran oil?

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Well polysaturated and monosaturated are good fats

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Not sure if the body needs fats

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Saturated and trans fats are bad

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Yes the body does need fats

[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Just not the bad ones I mentioned

[11-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Imagine just eating raw fruits and veggies

[11-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> I use Sunflower oil

[11-Jul-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do @CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]
