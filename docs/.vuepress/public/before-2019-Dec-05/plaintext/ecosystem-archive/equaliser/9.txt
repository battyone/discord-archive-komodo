[04-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thats the benefits for working for big corp. It doesnt make working for one self enticing especially the sacrifices that may need to be made to get an idea up and running so you can have the freedom to work doing what you love.

[04-Jul-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> They want slaves..

[04-Jul-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Debt slaves

[04-Jul-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The middle class is diminishing fast

[04-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> True. Either you go up and join the upper class with THEIR means of die in dust

[04-Jul-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It was the industrial revolution across the globe that helped create prosperity and shape the middle class however, it seems that to be middle class you have to service debt to own a place just to live and when property investors hoard supply it reduces housing stock for purchase, thus inflating property prices

[04-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Totally.. Here too the same is happening. I am from a middle class and I know how difficult it is.

[04-Jul-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> #gif-ted or #tipsy-rain are good for gifs however, no xp is given in #tipsy-rain

[04-Jul-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Why not make yuki stop from showing gifs in #tipsy-rain

[04-Jul-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Well nothing is wrong with it, what I meant was if it is for rain and stuff

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> exactly üòÑ and stuff

[04-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> So better restrict it to gif-ted and general

[04-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> üòâ

[04-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> no gifs in general. I like to use memory association or rhymes for remembering things. general is professional, the rest is the best
