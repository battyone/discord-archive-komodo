[13-Oct-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are they looking good, easy to use, stuff like that?

[13-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think you guy's should test it out a little, just to see how deposits/withdraws go

[13-Oct-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hopefully they don't have insane withdraw fees like exrates

[13-Oct-18 09:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> @digital bullion #tipsy-begin  check that room

[13-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @SwimedDragon I joined stakecube for a competition...never won anything

[13-Oct-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like a lot of discord channels I'm on....trying to win some coins

[13-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They do have airdrops and a lottery sometimes if you're staking coins there

[13-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't think the minimum to have is even high

[13-Oct-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> You only need $5 dollar value on there to get a share of the airdrops, and with all the free tipping and bots stuff around, isn't that hard to get if you don't plan on buying any, and the lottery requires you to get 10 stakes

[13-Oct-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Also not hard and some coins produce a lot more stakes a day

[13-Oct-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> don't know if I can be bothered really.

[13-Oct-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> like with a lot of comps...if it's easy enough to enter I might otherwise I couldn't be bothered

[13-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> It's been pretty quiet in the crypto discord land. Was buzzing at the start of the year, it will change, at the next bull cycle. Always good to have a good discord setup üëå üòÅ

[14-Oct-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Smoky Satoshi Indeed, wood ovens have been used throughout human history, one of the finer ways to cook and damn delicious for breads and pizza
