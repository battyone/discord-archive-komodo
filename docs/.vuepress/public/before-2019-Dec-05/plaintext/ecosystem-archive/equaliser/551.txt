[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, pricing is still down on EQLI. Someone's going to regret that soon. I hope this means the whale guy is getting tired and tries to dump his remaining stash (finally)

[18-Feb-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> 7 sats is quite disappointed hopefully that changes soon

[18-Feb-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> at least if ppl want they can get cheap EQLI if they are interested in investing

[18-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I hope to get some funds available soon but I'm afraid it's going to be too late, but I've got enough so either way I think all off us are happy enough when price goes up

[18-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just want to see the whales face if he sells so much and loses out on it

[18-Feb-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> ive been buying today...a LOT
11sats down to 7 sats
feels like hes done but not sure.
i would buy 2-3mm down here...just fyi

[18-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> silly prices NOT to be buying

[18-Feb-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye my average was between 15-20 sats

[18-Feb-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> So lucky you

[18-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I have already have  what I want sitting on a very large decent bag .

[18-Feb-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I wouldn't expect he's done. I've told a few people not to suddenly buy up at higher prices until we get a lot of new volume from new people. But if I can get some funds available next week and prices are still like this, I'm getting some more to be sure I can set some aside for reward contracts

[18-Feb-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Its disappointing, but nevertheless part of the game. I hate to see anyone dumpiing at these prices but hopefully we can sell them back to them at a much higher rate

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, we've been talking about how the dumper has almost run out and suddenly, next day there's 1.8m  more EQLI for sale than yesterday

[19-Feb-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But obviously shows there's plenty enough for sale for new people, hope they take this chance to get enough for reward contracts

[19-Feb-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye 1.8 m it‚Äôs still quite cheap at 9 sats lol

[19-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I saw that apex legends on a twitch stream, looks ok, I'm not big on multiplayer games. I often play couch co-op with my dad when I have the time.

[19-Feb-19 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Will the EQLI coin still be a way to purchase houses or will there be an alternate use for the coin?

[20-Feb-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will still be used for buying homes and more

[20-Feb-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
