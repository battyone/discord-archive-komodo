[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Take a look at this if you are interested in geothermal heating. Looks like pile foundations are used

World's Largest Geodesic Dome House Runs On Renewable Power (Photos)
Thanks to being sturdy and ultra-efficient with space, energy and materials, geodesic domes have been used as greenhouses, treehouses and also as homes. Located in Long Island, New York and measuring 70-feet in diameter and 44-feet

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @linkara6669 hi there

[11-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> geodesics were my first fascination.

[11-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> then monolithic, now i am completely consumed by aircrete lol

[11-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Yeah aircrete seems to have the most options as to what you can build with it

[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> how's it going today  @jellysmash?

[11-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> oh I have studied geothermal heating for a while now.

[11-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Thats great to hear.

[11-Sep-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <dolladollaiv> Have a favorite design?

[11-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> love geothermal heating

[11-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> when i have the money to do so, i really want to build a new house completely free of the grid, geothermal heating/cooling for the house, a greenhouse that is partially underground that is also heated /cooled that way, attached to the house, solar and wind to run miners and any electrical needs, the geothermal could assist there as well if needed, and would like to still do more in addition, but that is my basics xD

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> im sure i will be asking yall to help me make that dream happen haha  @CowboyCrypto

[11-Sep-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Then came the geodesic dome homes

[12-Sep-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If we build them.....dem buyers will come

[12-Sep-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Geodesics are a pain in the ass to keep from leaking

[12-Sep-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm working to create an aircrete monolithic lol

[12-Sep-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Interesting

[12-Sep-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea when I researched geodesic domes I read that leaking is a main concern

[12-Sep-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Could potentially coat the upper portion of the dome with a waterproof membrane like they coat the floor in a bathroom and shower recess before laying the tiles.

[12-Sep-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Elastomeric paint

[12-Sep-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But if not applied evenly it will crack

[12-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> What about a coating of tar?

[12-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Can paint it on

[12-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That would make for a good looking dome haha

[12-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You can paint over the top of the tar

[12-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> It's just an undercoat

[12-Sep-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Maybe another option could be a half cylinder style shape with  tin or colorbond shaped and added on top to be fully waterproof.

[12-Sep-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Similar in shape to those old 1940s style army barracks

[12-Sep-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> They'd have the curved shape on 2 sides that could be high wind resistant

[12-Sep-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Anyways just lots of different ideas to play with

[12-Sep-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> DomeGaia has a Hoophouse, which is low cost and could be a good option for widespread rollout.
