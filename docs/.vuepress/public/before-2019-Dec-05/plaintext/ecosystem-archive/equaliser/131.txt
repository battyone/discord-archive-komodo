[20-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> richmond won 111 to 57

[20-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> easy win for them

[20-Jul-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> no one expected St Kilda to win though

[20-Jul-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @AndronicusBass-Founder yesterday the guy who's been training me said "you're shifting better than people who have been here for 5 years"  . .. I don't think he's bullshitting me

[20-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> cause his name is pinned to my training now, you know? he had to sign off on my ass, so he wouldn't be saying that if he thought I would make his training look bad to the boss
