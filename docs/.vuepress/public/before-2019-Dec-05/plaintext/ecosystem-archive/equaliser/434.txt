[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I alway's hate how construction stuff alway's starts early in the morning

[16-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, they often start at 7 am already and are gone by 3 pm

[16-Sep-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I just wish they moved it an hour, or 2 hours in weekends

[16-Sep-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Zach> I will be able to read the article shortly, look forward to it

[17-Sep-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice going @Llama-Admin

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You guys are kicking ass!

[17-Sep-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have a lot to do tonight but there will be plenty that’s coming

[17-Sep-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> we hear you

[17-Sep-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :vote_up:

[17-Sep-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I’m starting to get excited lol

[17-Sep-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And worried lol I’m gonna be dog tired after I start building these houses

[17-Sep-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But luckily we will get the super hard stuff out of the way fast. Rebar, foundation, plumbing and electric will be designed into the blocks and foundation. Then when we build it to the stage of dried in, we can put it all in really quickly

[17-Sep-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Howdy y'all. Just poppin' my head in to say hi. As y'all have seen, things didn't go as planned. Where we should have been going forward and most likely would have already had at least one prototype up and available for people to look at, things went sideways. First rule of warfare.

[17-Sep-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Because of this, and other factors that had nothing to do with the project, I've had to take on full time employment outside the project, which is why I've been pretty much absent. Rest assured, I'm still here and doing what I can during this tough time. Cowboy has done the lion's share of the project work, followed closely by Andronicusbass . Cypher and I are dealing with our personal issues, and will be back to it full time as soon as possible. Life goes on, and so does Equaliser!

[17-Sep-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh I told y’all in the beginning it I will make it happen regardless.

[17-Sep-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im hooking the foam machine up to the big boy compressor tomorrow and making a block that’s 12 inches thick

[17-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nice 😄

[17-Sep-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Well, boys and girls, I'm going to try to be a little more active. I have secure employment now that takes a great deal of my time, but not as much as looking for work does 😄

[17-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Make sure you seal the sides

[17-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Good to see you around again Biomech 👍🏻

[17-Sep-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I never left 😛 Just didn't have time to talk.

[17-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thanks for checking in Biomech

[17-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Tomato tomato

[17-Sep-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Please pronounce those differently

[17-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's the finest of the fruits regardless of how you say it 😄

[17-Sep-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The benefits of decentralised collaboration and a a good team of top blokes 😃 A fantastic group of mods and admins too with a close community is a wonderful thing I'm certain we are all proud of, I know I am

[17-Sep-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> g'night y'all. I'm gonna try to be more active now that I have a solid schedule. One way or the other, this project is GOING to succeed. We have an amazing community, and things are starting to move in the proper direction. With that, I'm hungry and so's my family. Gonna go fix that.

[17-Sep-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Good night brother. The fort is manned and we will continue to charge forward helping to change the world. In the mean time you get that food on the table for your family and looking forward to having you back in here when you are able. 😉 ✌

[17-Sep-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol I just call him

[17-Sep-18 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I honestly get excited thinking about where EQLI could be in 6 months to a year. If there is anything I can do to help let me know, I have a full time job but it’s fairly flexible at times.

[17-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Thank you @Zach even the smallest contributions are extremely regarded and appreciated because when it comes to human peer to peer networking and community collaboration, every little bit adds to a beautiful picture like every brush stroke or piece of a picture puzzle 😊

[17-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Andy you’re so philosophical

[17-Sep-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Guess I should sign up for a Twitter then.. I’m a pretty anti social guy though so won’t do much good sharing tweets if I don’t have any friends/followers

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Engineer some man

[17-Sep-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> You can amass a following quick by posting positive things about crypto

[17-Sep-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Few hundred or so

[17-Sep-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I will think about it, not too big on the social media thing. Haven’t posted to Facebook in over 2 years probably

[17-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Up to you buddy

[17-Sep-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @Zach I only had couple of followers when I started using Twitter a bit since I got in with the equaliser project...I now have over 70.

[17-Sep-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Give me your Twitter userid and I will follow you

[17-Sep-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> The more you start to use Twitter and follow people, the more followers you will get..

[17-Sep-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's just a natural organic growth

[17-Sep-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> It’s late and I have a morning flight home. I will do that sometime this week 👍🏻

[17-Sep-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Ok

[17-Sep-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's fun actually

[17-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> And you'll see other people you know and follow tweeting some cool stuff

[17-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Which you can also comment on

[17-Sep-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Pick a cartoon character for your presence

[17-Sep-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Zach  I got off social media about 6 or 7 years ago but only stayed on linked in because of professional networking and real debating. Websites on economic discussions have also been one of my interests.  I have this year signed up on facebook only to use our page and actively using twitter now as it's all part of networking. I wouldn't recommend using social media if you don't have to, unless you have family overseas or truly believe in something you want to share, growth comes organically. Most of social media is a echo chamber of narcissism, food pics and trolling lol Safe travels. Chat you soon 😃

[17-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> That tends to be my thought process on social media as well. I even get tired of seeing pictures of my own kids that are posted on there haha

[17-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass Haha...food pics
