[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> been dropping pretty much all year

[25-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> time for it to rise

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 🤞

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I'm a bot trader 😄 Those rises and falls are profitable.

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But I think you're right. The correction is over or near too it. Time to rise up again.

[25-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> haha yeah well its bitcoin who knows

[25-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> tether knows.  synthetic pump. don't hodl..

[25-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hopefully the disconnect between BTC and the alts went away. we need alts to get some mojo

[25-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> print 100 mil T    wash it top 20 exchange.. price jumps everyone sell hodlers cry..

[25-Jul-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> everyone is an expert on btc ill just wait and see what happens lol

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> is not btc is tether that prop up price..

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> wasn't that tether printing a while ago?

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> yes

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> 1 day before pump

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> actually no

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> dyor 😃

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> when it happened btc didn't do much

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> if this rise in btc was due to tether the rise would of happened earlier

[25-Jul-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> 100,000,000  printed days before jump

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> unless of course its all a big conspiracy and whales are manipulating everything which is possible

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> its on explorer

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> and on charts

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> then btc jumped

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> why?

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> cool well ill hodl while btc crashes 😃

[25-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> 😃

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there are increasing numbers of big players all the time. not only big shady governments, but i think some legit governments are starting to get involved too. add hedge funds into the mix and there will be more and bigger events like this in the future

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> imo

[25-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i am 100 percent sure

[25-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> btc will either go up or down.. or it could go side ways

[25-Jul-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ive heard the arguments for it i just don't agree

[25-Jul-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> makes no sense to me but im only a wombat so who knows

[25-Jul-18 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> ok view this.  BTC futures and Long Short traders they must have way to close out the positions and wash the value  they wait for the futures martket to settle which it did then the  pump start for the next round of futures which will be a short

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe later ill read it

[25-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I was there 😄

[25-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> price   4k next 40 days..    3k next 70 days      sub 1k  next 120 days

[25-Jul-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Anyway, I don't buy the thing with futures and shorts, because the amount of BTC tied up in them is a fraction of what trades. Not a big fraction. It's very good for headlines, and I'm sure it does have some effect, but not that much.

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> More likely, it ran up on hype before adoption was big enough to sustain the price. Brought a LOT of new stupid people into the game.

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> problem I have with the view you hold is the people who think BTC is going to die have been around for a while

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> everytime BTC has crashed they have come out and said its going to 0

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They're the majority, so they go "I gotz to git me sum bitcoinz" and didn't care about the price.

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and everytime it rises they have made up some reason for the rise

[25-Jul-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> they must manipulate it some big firms put lots money into the future markets since they open we saw manipulation  is fact

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> and checkable

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> oh it only went back up because of this

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🚀📈edsky📉🤯> Everyone has an opinion

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it went back down it means its dead

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> oh it went back up.. it went up because it was manipulated

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> it honestly sounds childish to me

[25-Jul-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
