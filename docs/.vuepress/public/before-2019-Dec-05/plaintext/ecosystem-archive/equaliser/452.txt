[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good night

[19-Sep-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Whoever is dumping this is an idiot

[19-Sep-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> That‚Äôs not shaming that‚Äôs being real lol

[19-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yes, agreed

[19-Sep-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> doesn't make a lot of sense

[19-Sep-18 10:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> anyways I've finished weights, checked prices, checked discord...so now time to get to work

[19-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> it's raining in sydney this morning which was a bit of a surprise waking up to

[19-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> that, and also the the price

[19-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> EQLI is such a solid project, it's gonna be massive

[19-Sep-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> we'll look back in a couple months time and wish we bought more EQLI

[19-Sep-18 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I bought a lot in the first days

[19-Sep-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Just bought some for about a 10th that I bought it in the early days lol

[19-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I have only purchased in the 1-30 sats range

[19-Sep-18 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Actually I might have purchased some for under 1 sat when exrates let you go to 9 decimal places

[19-Sep-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Lol

[19-Sep-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I bought around 6 million once we got on exrates

[dscrdeql] <scabboy (Australia)> ok. what happens with the coins that are generated each block atm

[20-Sep-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'm a bit disjointed tonight

[20-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, there's been a horrible accident in my country where 4 kids died on a train track üò¢

[20-Sep-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's been said that 3 of those children came from one family

[20-Sep-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Some sort of electric cargo bike thing those kids were sitting in went nuts and drove on the track. Probably trouble with the brakes.

[20-Sep-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <stretcher83> Its heart breaking when you read stories like that in the news, especially 3 siblings from the same family, üò≥, i feel for the parents

[20-Sep-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I haven't seen it happen, but lots of people have. I've once seen an old woman got hit by a car so I know how it is to witness an accident. But I can't imagine how it must feel like to see this happen to multiple children

[20-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> It's a sad reality of life that things like that happen all the time üò¶
