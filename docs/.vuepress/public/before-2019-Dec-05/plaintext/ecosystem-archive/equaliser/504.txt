Exchange: Bitstamp
Amount: $5,100,000 (19,000 BTC)
Hackers sent a malicious file to exchange employees. One of the system administrators has neglected security rule #1: "Don't open files from strangers" and opened the file on the machine that had access to the exchange's BTC wallet. 19,000 BTC were stolen.
