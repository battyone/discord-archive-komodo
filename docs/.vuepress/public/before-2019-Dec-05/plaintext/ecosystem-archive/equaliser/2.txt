[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Especially using a mobile

[04-Jul-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That's why BarterDEX and HyperDEX are awesome, no accounts needed and you trade directly from your wallet üëå

[04-Jul-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I wonder if binance DEX will require you to send funds to a wallet on their system?

[04-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> Be interesting what changes binance will make...if any

[04-Jul-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
