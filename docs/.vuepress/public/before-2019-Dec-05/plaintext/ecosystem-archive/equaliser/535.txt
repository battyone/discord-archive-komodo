[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Homeless people everywhere around the world. That's why the world needs Equaliser.

[03-Jan-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Agreed!

[03-Jan-19 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <AndronicusBass> I've noticed a big increase of homeless in Australia, I'm so angry that it's happening.

[dscrdeql] <squintz> Oppsy looks like I bought a dead coin. Enjoy my BTC

[04-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> @squintz not dead buddy just low volume at the moment the team will begin building this year

[04-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> hold onto what you got you will not be disappointed this coin is still under the radar

[04-Jan-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> although no one will blame you for thinking the way you just did.. it is very quiet around here

[04-Jan-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> reward contracts should begin soon and cowboy is working on the engineering approval for the blocks so building can begin

[04-Jan-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> with the bear market things have just taken a little longer

[04-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @squintz not even close to dead. Also welcome! We have a lot of work being done to get our first build underway.

[04-Jan-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Wait a few weeks and we will see some progress on the charts I believe

[04-Jan-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If it makes you feel better I’ve bought more Equaliser than anyone I know.

[04-Jan-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Birth and death are closely similar as each generally requires care and attention. We are just getting started
