[28-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I put all my 1000 coins in. Utxo splits to like 43, 155, 400,...

[28-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> It let me post a sell for 200, but nothing else

[28-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> No wonder i never used it

[28-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> When new investors come in they will be asking questions about the top 100.. i think maybe write something up explaining the locked funds and wallets they are in, team funds, charity, marketing etc what you think?

[28-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It's on the "to do" list üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> top 25 wallets holds 80.75% need to explain that

[28-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> No shit? That's quick üòÑ Like even for a top tier exchange üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah not sure if they have improved or i just got lucky and its that time of the day they process things haha

[28-Jul-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but that was really nice i was expecting to get it tomorrow

[28-Jul-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Those wallets are mostly controlled by the Equaliser team. We split it up for safety üòÑ We'll detail it all out as we have time.

[28-Jul-18 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Where is the list of wallets?

[28-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yes I figured that... I would like to know in detail but its more for new investors if they don't know they might hesitate to get in

[28-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> http://explore-equaliser.io/richlist

[28-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @NWhiskeyTango

[28-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Also, I am doing maintenance on the explorer right now, so you might get bum data. I'll let you all know when it's fully operational again.

[28-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> though that richlist shouldn't be affected üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Ty

[28-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah transparency is important. you can tell with us as we aren't an anonymous team lol

[28-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yup.

[28-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep i only invest in transparent teams now

[28-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We ain't gonna babble ALL of our business, because that gives competitors a lead sometimes, but we don't keep much from the public üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah when the team is transparent you feel like you get to know them

[28-Jul-18 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> And we always try to have someone from the team active 24/7.

[28-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> You are doing a great job guys can't wait for the next steps

[28-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Which makes a tired team ...

[28-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> You guys are doing great with staying update to 24/7 to take care of everyone

[28-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> For sure, its important that we have gotten to know people before we promote.

[28-Jul-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will only improve as we go forward.

[28-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep üòÉ

[28-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> my vision always played out something like this: We create a coin, we create a community- A tight knit community, we build homes, people from community buy homes-- some for vacation some for permanent residency, we have a true crypto community

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> and slowly take over the world... oh, wait, that was a different script...

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Getting on to cmc does not seem too difficult anymore for example this coin was listed https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gold-bits-coin/ . Will you contact them soon or wait for more volume?

[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We've been in contact with them. We need to hit USD 100K in sales, once, and we're listed.

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Alright great

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i don't know how that coin got on lol

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> We came close  during the dICO, but now things must grow as they will.

[28-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Smart plan @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[28-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I contacted them last week, they said we needed to become a bit more established before they will list us

[28-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I am going to contact coincodex this week as well to get listed there

[28-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there is alot of administrative work to finish up along with preparing for the coming months.

[28-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Going to try hyperdex and try to get some movement

[28-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[tlgrm] <Cypherthegreat> Hey how's it going

[28-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> exrates just got me my coins out in 15 min

[dscrdeql] <x2maano> how????????

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> about 4 mins for me cowboy

[28-Jul-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Hyperdex..."could not connect to electrum server" on every coin on startup

[28-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Think i need to go to the KMD community

[28-Jul-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> EQL price chart in hyperdex haven't been active in days for me now

[28-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I think they have to recheck

[28-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> no volume

[28-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> ^trying to create volume.

[28-Jul-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> ahhh

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah maybe ask the kmd user support

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Maybe i go stir the pot...would be nice if i can get a couple trades post 1st though

[28-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah give it a shot

[28-Jul-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just letting you all know that exrates is in the middle of an upgrade session.

[28-Jul-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they will be spotty until the 2nd as I understand but they are fixing all the major flaws I have seen: withdraw times, high fees, 2fa and layout

[28-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> honestly if they do that, then they are definitely a competitor to big exchanges.

[28-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> where are they based?

[28-Jul-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im sure their volume is mostly wash trading but with those fixes and some appropriate shilling they could become a competitor

[28-Jul-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Indonesia

[28-Jul-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> üëç

[28-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> I see most of these exchanges are based in Aisa

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> loose regulation on them when compared to the US

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Everything said here and on tg is posted in the kmd equaliser channel lol

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
See?

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yup

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[28-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it keeps us all connected üòÑ

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I guess nobody monitors it there

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> komodo has its own stuff to worry about honestly.

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> when both discord and telegram get busy might have to turn it off though

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they are much larger than we are

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> or else it will be hard to keep a conversation

[28-Jul-18 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> telegram is not the most fun

[28-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> i need to check my tg lol

[28-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Does the hyperdex swap, the full order, have to be filled for it to be completed?

[28-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> no

[28-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it can fill a partial order i beleive

[28-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
