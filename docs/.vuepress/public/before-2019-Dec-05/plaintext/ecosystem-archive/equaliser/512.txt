[dscrdeql] <zuzana> good day

[18-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah I'm gonna miss the 15-20C day's, no need to produce any heat, with this cold it will cost a lot of power/gas to warm up homes

[18-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> here right now are... -2 / -3 degree 😐  and no snow

[18-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> \yet

[18-Nov-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you happy to get snow there?

[18-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Offcourse nobody likes long periods of snow here because traffic will suffer on it badly, but some few day's, hopefully around Christmass period, will be most welcome to get some snow over here

[18-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But some years there's no snow at all

[18-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> well i love some snow 😄

[18-Nov-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I plan to see snow one day, I have never seen it. Someone told me the novelty wears off very quickly when you get wet socks lol

[18-Nov-18 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
