[22-Oct-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Massimo wasnt included in your soak either

[22-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> @Jonathan-Admin @Llama-Admin do you guys know that that message for massimostyle could mean? says frozen by an admin

[22-Oct-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> I haven't seen it before, @tipsy_dev | auscoi ?

[22-Oct-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> 😮 Tipsy has gone rogue!

[22-Oct-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> hahaha wow

[22-Oct-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> ok here's what happened

[22-Oct-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> It's been so long I forgot myself

[22-Oct-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> So there's some special roles that can be applied by admins to limit user activity. Not sure who put it on you but you had the "No Rain" limiter on you which takes you off the active list and keeps you from being able to even make it rain yourself.

[22-Oct-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> I took that off @MassimoStyle for now, maybe someone accidentally clicked it on there? It IS possible to do that with these menu systems.

[22-Oct-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Or maybe someone was punishing you haha! Either way, you're free and clear to rain now.

[22-Oct-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 👍

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> ~hello guys how are we ?progress so far on the latest exchange?

[22-Oct-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> They're listing all coins for free I think, so I really wonder why it's taking them so long. Some other coins that had a free chance already got listed. Maybe they're very busy and still talking about the wallet? It's important that all goes well, so if it's needed it's good that they take the time. But I do not know any update, so hope someone of the team can help

[22-Oct-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yea It should have been listed by now

[22-Oct-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> did you bbq them?
