[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I've been so busy at work today

[28-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice to check in though

[28-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But gotta bounce again

[28-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Have fun @✌Jellysmash✌ - be careful

[28-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Just catching up on the conversation since I was sleeping 😃

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice

[28-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Great and thanks @AndronicusBass-Founder - what are the vulnerabilities?

[28-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Quick question folks. Wanted to share info about this project with a few friends but didn't see the token on coinmarketcap nor livecoinwatch. Are we listed anywhere?

[28-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> (Besides our own site?)

[28-Aug-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AJ Kaiser> Hey guys how r u

[28-Aug-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Aug-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ☕

[28-Aug-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Andy promote jelly to mod pls

[28-Aug-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @RyanInSiam  we have applied several times we need to get a bit more established is what we were told

[28-Aug-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You have to remember we aren't just another crypto like most that claim to be the next bitcoin. Most coins rely on hype and large community, houses is what makes equaliser strong. CMC is considering however after a few houses and particlarly the first house being news, they will probably list us in a split second. They have many projects contacting them all the time so communication with them isnt the best.

[28-Aug-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Understood, folks. Just curious.

[28-Aug-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @✌Jellysmash✌ Yeah boi, you mod now bro 👌

[28-Aug-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Wow. Congrats, @✌Jellysmash✌ !

[28-Aug-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @RyanInSiam sure not a problem. If you take a look at the dot points I posted in #welcome-invite channel, I think point 4 helps explain part of what strengthens the value 😃

[28-Aug-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Not everyone I know is on Discord, but I'll keep in mind for discussions. 😃 Can always share info by word-of-mouth.

[28-Aug-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Yeah, I only knew of discord in feb. It is underutilised even for non blockchain companies and businesses

[28-Aug-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> When i was working in I.T I wish I knew about it to pitch as a solution to my superiors, great team collaboration and community engagement tool

[28-Aug-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> My IT department wants to get everyone on Slack, but many of our staff don't even know how to use e-mail.

[28-Aug-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Getting them to sign up for a new site and actually use it would be nigh impossible.

[28-Aug-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Though, we desperately need such a tool for better collaboration and cooperation between departments, branches, and so on.

[28-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @RyanInSiam I've heard slack is very good

[28-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> There are many tools out there, I would advise against slack, it is basically a enterprise discord and I found it had quite a learning curve. Sharepoint 365 is pretty cool. Ive used various versions of sharepoint throughout the years. On premises  you will probably need SQL server database but i believe 365 has a cloud solution

[28-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> We might start using it where I work

[28-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> I used Slack some time ago for PIVX and other projects.

[28-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <RyanInSiam> Then, one-by-one, a lot of projects migrated here to Discord.

[28-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @AndronicusBass whoa...just saw

[28-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I scrolled up

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice

[28-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Thanks

[28-Aug-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
