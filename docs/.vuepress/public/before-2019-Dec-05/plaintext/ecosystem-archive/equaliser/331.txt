[17-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> it's up and down . how are you ? ðŸ˜ƒ

[17-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Gold down to almost 2 year lows, crypto down hard, feels like a play in action with stock markets climbing, corporate money is probably exiting at the peak and into crypto just before the next recession any time soon. Thoughts?

[17-Aug-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> not atm i just stand by and watch and pick up a few when it's is low-

[17-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> What's your thoughts on global markets?

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> interesting

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> wondering if all that money will flow into Crypto

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> or not

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> whales seem to be dumping on crypto

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> everything loooks crap at the moment

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> there are spikes when crypto looks good

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and just when we think it's finally going again..

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> whamo

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's dumped hard and fast

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it will pick up evcentually

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> just maybe not that quickly

[17-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> glad to be wrong though

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but reallly....in hindsight

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it just keepso going lower

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> adn when I think it can't go lower.....

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it does

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's why it's important to back meaningful projects

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> projects that will help others

[17-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> liek Equaliser

[17-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <slipersty> @AndronicusBass-Founder i think that we soon will se a crach in global markets

[17-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> ðŸ”¸ Equaliser provides access to a great store of value in real estate. Buying Equaliser gives no one claims or rights to already established property however, rather the opportunity to purchase property we build by paying with our coin which also strengthens Equaliser's value.

[17-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> Hmm hmm wonder how it would be possible to buy a house with equi

[17-Aug-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> The register of titles is an interesting idea, how would the data and documents for that be kept?

[17-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <shah1305> Hi everyone

[17-Aug-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think that there need to be a lot of new people joining into crypto to break the circle we're in now

[17-Aug-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Enough to keep up if the whales dump again

[17-Aug-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @Podmaster data on the blockchain, title registry, proof of ownership and smart contracts.
