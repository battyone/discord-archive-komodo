[01-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> soon i'll meet with some friends for some boilded wine 😄

[01-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> but still have to rain 20 EQLI 😄

[01-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice one

[01-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Boilded sounds unusual

[01-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Need everyone to throw a few sats at this support line please.

[01-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Wow, damn, my order got filled 😮

[01-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Was talking about it with someone yesterday that there wasn't much EQLI buy support if it would get filled, not fun to see it go to here 😦

[01-Dec-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sell orders are pretty thin too up until certain amounts

[01-Dec-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can move some around and set up some buy support but I need to wait for it to be sold

[01-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think it's good if the whale dumps at this price because at this price range we can buy more EQLI compared to sell orders on let's say, 50 sats

[01-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think it's been proven also on exrates that we keep falling down till 20 sats

[01-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have a solution but I need a few days

[01-Dec-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Might be a tai bo black belt in disguise

[01-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Don't set buy orders too high

[01-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Who knows lol

[01-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've been watching now and then and I think the dumper is waiting for higher buy orders but eventually dumps something if it takes too long

[01-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[01-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But mostly after day's without volume

[01-Dec-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It’s all good either way

[01-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once I have the first house up, we are golden.

[01-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just have to keep us above water until then

[01-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We'll get there, we should be happy he is dumping coins now at this low price

[01-Dec-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Exactly

[01-Dec-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There’s always a silver lining

[01-Dec-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Only thing I'm curious about is how many coins he has lol. When we hit that 20 sats for the first time on exrates I hoped he'd ran out on coins, but seems like he didn't

[01-Dec-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Once I recover from this abscess, I should be able to get everything going smoothly again

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> A few day's break from crypto world can be very nice

[01-Dec-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Sometimes I'm so busy that on some day's I can't even check crypto besides before I go to sleep, it's like an addiction. But if I barely check it feels good, but I still end up checking prices all the time

[01-Dec-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Probably because it's easy to acces and check

[01-Dec-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, it's easy to check prices these days

[01-Dec-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Funny thing is that even lots of ''poor'' people in my country have phones

[01-Dec-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I've even saw an article not long ago about some sort of clothing for homeless people that can collect sunlight to charge their phones. It's hard to imagine some random homeless guy having a phone of a couple hundred dollars worth

[01-Dec-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the poorest people here have the best phones.  They have latest iphones...maybe that's why they don't have much money...they can't budget

[01-Dec-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> There are also a lot of food banks around here, and sometimes the phones you see people have who go to there, it's just insane lol

[01-Dec-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I sometimes feel like beeing poor but that's because we keep track of all that we get and spend
