[dscrdeql] <Chacho-KC> It was just an idea and I think it is too much work, especially once the building starts, it would need someone else to look at those things if it would be even possible to do.

[20-Nov-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Chacho-KC> Yes yes yes

[20-Nov-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763

[20-Nov-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> last year bad news = market rise

[20-Nov-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> $3k

[20-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Do you really think xrp is gonna make number 1?

[20-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> it seems like the main stream is with xrp

[20-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> It's above ETH now

[20-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> i just think that if the bankers want xrp at the top it will get there

[20-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> if the people at the top don't want something to succeed 99 percent chance it won't succeed
