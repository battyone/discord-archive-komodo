[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> It hurts seen my order not fill. Maybe I have to change from eth to btc instead

[30-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If you already have a nice amount, don't rush into buying as there's still a chance that a whale might dump

[30-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But do what you feel like is best

[30-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I'm hoping. I did a 55 and hoping it get fill

[30-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Might be force to jump on buy order cuz I need it bad

[30-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Didn't you buy earlier when it was lower?

[30-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> nope

[30-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> üò±

[30-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Well, looking at the buy orders I don't think the whale has a good chance to dump it all

[30-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So I'm not sure on this but this might be a last chance to get in cheaply

[30-Aug-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Hopefully. You'll never know hopes he dumpers soon

[30-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> To be honest I had hoped he'd dump some more too, but we had a lot of chances to buy it cheaply. I do hope your order gets filled, but after that I hope the dumper is done

[30-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Me too

[30-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But I can understand it's hard to decide, if you have a buy order at 5 sats for let's say 300k, if you set it at 15 sats it's only for 100k EQLI

[30-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> morning @SwimedDragon

[30-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And the thing is, if I would do that, you'll alway's see it goes down after you bought higher

[30-Aug-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But sell orders seem to look smaller too now

[30-Aug-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> Yep we got mainly holders now üëç

[30-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Might just buy direct from sell orders cuz i need it

[30-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> No matter the cost on sats

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's long term hold, and once those houses get build I can see it going up only

[30-Aug-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> So don't panic sell if the whale dumps again

[30-Aug-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wom-mod> Don't panic sell will regret it if you do

[30-Aug-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Morning everyone

[30-Aug-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hi @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[30-Aug-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> How‚Äôs it goin

[30-Aug-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> slow summer day...nothing happening

[30-Aug-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> you doing more tests today?

[30-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I ended up having to work more than I cared to yesterday lol

[30-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Today I‚Äôll finish up the foam generator and get a pour in I‚Äôm hoping

[30-Aug-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sounds good üëç

[30-Aug-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Mornin' peeps. Trying to not be so absent üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Things are a little rough in the Biomech household. Anyway, it's nice to see the dumper finally slowing down. I have spoken with a few of the traders there (you guys know who you are), and they are working diligently to acquire and hold üòÑ Given the past history of the dumper, I'm hesitant to say it's over, but it's definitely looking up.

[30-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> And with @CowboyCrypto- Founder moving things forward quickly on the building front despite all our obstacles, things are looking good on the project again.

[30-Aug-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs all coming together.

[30-Aug-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <gh√∏st> good news

[30-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> nice to hear üìà

[30-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ok guess I‚Äôm gonna get my ass out of bed and get to the shop so I can start working

[30-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I really hope that dumper is gone now

[30-Aug-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they cant have much left honestly.

[30-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I've bought close to 6 million coins from them

[30-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Very nice at these prices!

[30-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and I dont have a coin on the exchange for under 1000 sats

[30-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> under 1000 sats or under the 9 digits 1000 sats?

[30-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> under 1000 sats.

[30-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I know better than to play into that game.

[30-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think most of us bought everything at least below 20 sats since it was sitting there for a long time

[30-Aug-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> super cheap considering the ico price was like 30 cents usd

[30-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I think we're very lucky with that. I do feel bad for people that paid 30 cents per EQLI for it

[30-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, it's an incredible loss if you look at today's price. Offcourse I hope most of them are smart enough to hold

[30-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> that'd be a super long hold

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, how much is current price in cents?

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> they should just buy more to make up for it

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Like 0.01 or less.

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah true

[30-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But still, if you paid a few hundred or even a thousand, I can imagine it must suck to see the price down at this

[30-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> our early investors are ok with where we are at right now because they know what is coming.

[30-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> Am I considered an early investor?

[30-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> this current situation is easilly turned. one person walking in and market buying 1 btc worth sends this project into orbit.

[30-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I bought an ish ton 0.00000009 BTC so i think i'm good still, haven't check prices lately

[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> 7 zeroes ^ lol

[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I guess you were an early one llama... but I was referring to the ones who bought in before we ever announced anything

[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> The supply that isn't sold at Ico, is there already some news on what's going to happen with that?

[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I cant say anything on that one yet üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> it will all come out soon.

[30-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> between cowboy founder and the rest of us i would think we bot at least 10mm

[30-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> you can see part of the allocation on our site, its the team allocation, advisor allocation, etc etc. but the remaining unsold coins will be put to good use

[30-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think you all will be happy with what we have planned

[30-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm too curious now haha

[30-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I looks low still just checked, wish i had some more BTC to play with :/

[30-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe the unsold supply gets burned :tipsy:

[30-Aug-18 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I'm loser I guess

[30-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> why you say that?

[30-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hopefully a part of it can be hold for exchange payments in the future
