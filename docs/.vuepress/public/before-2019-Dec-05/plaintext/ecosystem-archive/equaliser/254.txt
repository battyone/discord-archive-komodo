[01-Aug-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Might try it. I have 1.1.0-rc

[01-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> But I'm pretty sure I'm just screwing up 😛 Bdex is odd.

[01-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> ;D

[01-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> i'll put up an offer

[01-Aug-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> upgrading to 1.1.1

[01-Aug-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> i much prefer bdex over hyperdex

[01-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> mainly because i can get it to fill my orders 😄

[01-Aug-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> i see a KMD/EQL pair 0.111

[01-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> ^ did you place it @Biomech-Founder

[01-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> double checking, I don't think that's me.

[01-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> lol no that's me

[01-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> buy it

[01-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> HEY FROG MAN

[01-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> nope, not mine.

[01-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> What did I do wrong 😄 I see yours, and it shows ME mine...

[01-Aug-18 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> hmm

[01-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> any special router firewall settings?

[01-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Nope. It's a droplet running Ubuntu.

[01-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Just default.

[01-Aug-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ok, I think I know. It's checked as limit order, immediate. The good to cancel slider is on, but I think I chose the wrong check box. Does that sound reasonable?

[01-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> @webworker01  how much are you selling? for .1111 i can't see the eql amount

[01-Aug-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> click on the order, it'll show you on the side, I think.

[01-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> yeah it does say utxo 0 😕

[01-Aug-18 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <webworker01> something like that

[01-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> ok... how do I cancel trades? I thought it was the red button, but it's not doing anything.

[01-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> under my offers there's a red stop button it should work

[01-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <webworker01> might take a bit to refresh

[01-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> what seems to the problem with you guys?

[01-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Maybe I should 😛 Linux isn't being nice. Or Bdex isn't.

[01-Aug-18 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Ok, there it goes. Just being slow.

[01-Aug-18 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
