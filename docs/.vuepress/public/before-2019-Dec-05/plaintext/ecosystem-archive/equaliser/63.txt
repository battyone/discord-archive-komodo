[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @MagicByt3 You can copy a picture and paste it in discord directly

[09-Jul-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Yeaa

[09-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Most of the time, discord resolves a URL and shows a preview or the object itself

[09-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> for me is not working to copy&paste just link is shown.

[09-Jul-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> if you go to #tipsy-begin and type ?begin

[09-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Make it rain!!

[09-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> I love the rain

[09-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> For the first time lll

[09-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> However you will need to level up to level 2 to be able to receive rain and to level up is chatting and gaining XP.

[09-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I buy from sale,  I see giveaway of coins is EQL now airdrop??

[09-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Giveaway was a competition to share and like our twitter and join discord. What do you mean by airdrop sorry?

[09-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I no see in whitepaper about this airdrop.  If EQL is now airdrop? What about investors? If can get free EQL here is hard on investing party.  Airdrop if you have free coins.  and someone buy coins.  who will sell first?  person who get's free?  or person who invested?

[09-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> or is bounty still active?  coins?

[09-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> I see on btc talk there is bounty coins

[09-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> s

[09-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> No air drop. we are not ERC20 token

[09-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Airdrop??

[09-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> some team say airdrop some do not?

[09-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> confusing

[09-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Oh right, that was only a few hundred divided across all users

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Cypher uses that term when he's doing a giveaway. There's no systemic airdrop, just some prizes from time to time.

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> Is like bounty coins?

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Yeah, or events.

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> understand üòÉ

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> when airdrop comes people panic...

[09-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> so to recive tips from rains here from tipsy bot, you have to be here a long time. Its nice to accumulate a few free coins but we have made it so it doesnt disparage investors. It is fun and a game to gain a little amount of coins

[09-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> such as when we reach certain growth levels, he will 'airdrop' a few coins to the new people and those who invited them. It's not a significant number, just a way of saying thank you to the community.

[09-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Exactly

[09-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its a fun thing

[09-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Before you chat more, so you dont miss experience points, can you click this >> #tipsy-begin and then type:  ?begin

[09-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I would be more eloquent, but the ‚òï is still brewing.

[09-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MagicByt3> + TY understand now as did not see in whitepaper about this
