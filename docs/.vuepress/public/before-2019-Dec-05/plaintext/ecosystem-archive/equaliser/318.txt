[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> where I work in Chatswood it's become very chinese oriented now...and it's pushed the price up to insane levels.

[15-Aug-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> Quite a few real estate agencies there as well that don't have any signs in English...all in chinese

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Good afternoon ðŸ˜ƒ Ah that price seems to be the same right?

[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's a pretty stable price for EQLI today

[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> not much change

[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> dumper didn't strike today @Steve10

[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Maybe he will again tomorrow ðŸ˜±

[15-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Yeah it didn't fluctuate as much as it has

[15-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Still no clue to who it is? Or his wallet adress?

[15-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> no...don't know

[15-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> they must of had a very big bag to begin with

[15-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> nice of them to airdrop on us

[15-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, but I'm still curious who it is. Maybe he's even in here looking at us haha

[15-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hmmm, where is this secret room? ðŸ˜„

[15-Aug-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I can't find it ðŸ˜¦

[15-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> hi guys, how do I add EQLI to agama native mode please?

[15-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> why naitive?

[15-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> any @Moderators have ze answer

[15-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> cause that where I manage all my KMD

[15-Aug-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> I have a few different addresses

[15-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> I thought would be easier

[15-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I still use litemode @ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯

[15-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> but if lite is easier to setup i'll go with that

[15-Aug-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghost> I go to light mod through KMD
in agama - activate coin
add an equalizer

[15-Aug-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> with native mode I could not figure out how to add my key

[15-Aug-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I think one of the founders should be able to help you with this though.. they are much better with agama

[15-Aug-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> i'll use the lite for the interim I'm going to buy some EQLI

[15-Aug-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> with litemode i just put in my pass phrase and im set .. i tried native mode (when we were having wallet issues) but could not figure out how to put in my passphrase

[15-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> native mode is weird in agama no seed

[15-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆedskyðŸ“‰ðŸ¤¯> all stored in wallet.dat file

[15-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Aug-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
