Time to set sail Pirates. 
We've built the new discord and we want to get all of us migrated over there. We have radio, and tip bots and will get a bridge to the one remaining Pirate channel in KMD discord once everyone sets sail.
TODAY THE INVITE BOUNTY STARTS!!!!
So get your ref link and lets annoy everyone on social media platforms from Instagram to Twitter, FB to Gab, Reddit to Steemit!
