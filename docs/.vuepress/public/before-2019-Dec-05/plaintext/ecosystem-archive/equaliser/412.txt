[07-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> phone died

[07-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> you mean you've been using discord on your mobile

[07-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I find the whole keyboard aspect of discord on the mobile hard to use

[07-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> too slow

[07-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> A proper keyboard is so good

[07-Sep-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> especially when able to type  quickly

[07-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> â˜•

[07-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> time to do some weights soon

[07-Sep-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> good way to start of saturday morning

[07-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I woke up this morning and thought how great Equaliser is

[07-Sep-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> i feel lucky to be in on this project so early on

[07-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Someone dumped a bit again ðŸ˜¦

[07-Sep-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Not sure what the person is trying to do

[07-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But since it didn't get dumped lower seems like the one doing is running out of supply

[07-Sep-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghÃ¸st> good night

[07-Sep-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> It's worth spending a bit of time to get it right

[07-Sep-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> a bit of  a rainy weekend starting up

[08-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> that's ok

[08-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> it's been very dry for a long time

[08-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> time to drink more coffee

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I finished weights earlier

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> tomorrow is an off day

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> and good to just relax for rest of weekend

[08-Sep-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> Sup @âœŒJellysmashâœŒ

[08-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> Still Fri nite in the USA

[08-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> I'm a budtender

[08-Sep-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> And work was insane today

[08-Sep-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> sounds good @cryptic1

[08-Sep-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> bar tender would be a good job

[08-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> get to do lots of talking ....i presume

[08-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but if you're crazy busy then you probably don't

[08-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I work in an office

[08-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> so I like to go to the tea room and chat all the time

[08-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> drink lots of coffee and tea

[08-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> I've wondered what it'd be like working in the restaurant type business

[08-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> where you get to deal with customers

[08-Sep-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> maybe it'd be a shit of a job if you get irate customers
