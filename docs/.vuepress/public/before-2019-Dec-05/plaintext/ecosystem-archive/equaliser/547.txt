[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Is that a side wall panel in tweet? How high will the ceiling be? Be good to have height that a lot of older houses have. New houses seem to have lower ceilings (2.7m) I think.

[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, seems like there was some bigger volume movement üòÆ Very nice buy price üëç

[02-Feb-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm still waiting for btc to go down before buying more

[02-Feb-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think a lot of us have this thing, but if I would decide to buy now, you'll see it goes down after that moment üòÇ

[02-Feb-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I would start scaling in buddy

[02-Feb-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> There are a lot of 10x potential bags right now

[02-Feb-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, I still have some coins I want to buy, I even got some lower buy orders in because I really think we'll be seeing a dip again and lots of those coins often dip with btc. In the past I set a low order, and was afraid missing out if it didn't got filled, but I know I just gotta stick to the lower buy order and have patience. Sometimes it takes months for it to fill, but it will be worth it. But as for getting more btc, I'm waiting it out. If it goes up, I've got enough spend already to be happy with the results anyway, so there's no feeling of missing out on coins now

[02-Feb-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just started rebuilding my folio with btc I mine

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, another hot one for sydney today around mid 30s

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> interesting article...btc thriving in real estate in australia

[03-Feb-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Even with property correction of 40% in Australia if you watch aussie 60 minutes tonight, Martin north is going to be on, what we will build will outlast the current cookie cutter single layer brick veneer style home and be more efficient in heating and cooling.

[03-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Martin north is digital finance analytics pretty good yt show and John Adams is on there alot to, he's good, used to be a government economic policy advisor, he tells the truth

[03-Feb-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> a property correction of 40% would put a lot of australian home owners in trouble. their loans would be more than the worth of the property.  recipe for economic disaser

[03-Feb-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> That is true unfortunately. I dont think there is a way around it unless bank lending is loosened again but too much credit in an economy can be a disaster. Although banks have created the money for loans out of nothing, best thing they can do is discount mortgages but we know that aint happening in a million years üò¶

[03-Feb-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> you going to watch 60 minutes?

[dscrdeql] <Smedley> Any updates on the rewards contract?

[04-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> We have started and testing needed but I think about a few weeks to a month. I mistook cc activation for rewards contracts. At 205000 cc was enabled and now crypto conditions contracts can be created and used on the chain. We will be coding more and be able to push forward creating our registry. Damn I love Komodo and the team behind it. We will be updating community more in the future, holiday season was busy for many and 2018 was a very difficult year. 2019 I believe will be much better for crypto now other global markets get increasingly shakey

[04-Feb-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
