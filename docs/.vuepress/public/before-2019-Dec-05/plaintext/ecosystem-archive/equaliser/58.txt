[09-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> EQL is only available at the momnet on Barterdex

[09-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> can't remember which one

[09-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Cool

[09-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> the Ticker tape is EQLI

[09-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> it used to be EQL but another community ended up getting in a week earlier and got that code

[09-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <jellysmash> so Equisiler change their ticker code to EQLI

[09-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]> Hmmm interesting

[09-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
