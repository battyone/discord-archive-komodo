[20-Jul-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> @üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ you can take you seed phrase from coinomi and put it in agama. That way you will get the accumulated interest.

[20-Jul-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Ehmjhay98> @NWhiskeyTango yes, Thanks I have done it already.

[20-Jul-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> there is a green "claim" button. when u click on it agama sends your entire balance with rewards to yourself

[20-Jul-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüüåü‚òÑKQweciüåüüåü‚òÑ> Ook

[20-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> and the komodo team officially changed them from interest to rewards for religious reasons.

[20-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> earlier this yr

[20-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> Lol @ religious reasons

[20-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> sounds funny. but i was speaking to one of the devs and he said bc muslims arent allowed to collect interest they decided to change the wording

[20-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Steve10> Lol I didn't know that.

[20-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> interesting

[20-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> More like tax reasons...the difficulties of "staked" earnings and taxation is tough

[20-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well i know they don't compromise

[20-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> I know many muslims who have money in banks and 401ks and whatever, not one has said cliaming interest is against their religion

[20-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe they are trying to get the gulf countries on board üëå

[20-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[20-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> My experiences are much different and I have grown up with them lol interest is haram

[20-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> There will be a lot of changes in staking because the taxes this year

[20-Jul-18 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
