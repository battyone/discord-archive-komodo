[25-Jul-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> that doesn't reflect the real value

[25-Jul-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> good for everyone who bought but these prices are ridiculously cheap ico price was .50 cents

[25-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> i dont understand

[25-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 1 EQL = .50 CENTS

[25-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> thats u mean @CombatWombat

[25-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> howdy, sorry was afk. It seems someone with money to burn is dumping at a loss, very cheap right now

[25-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> its crazy

[25-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> @x2maano yeah that what the ico price was you can ask bass any questions

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> more then crazy

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> we had bonuses the first few weeks when purchased with KMD

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah but how big were these bounties?

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> how can i bought or sell it

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> ???

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> a fair bit has been dumped for dirt dirt dirt cheap

[25-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> tiny in comparison

[25-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> roughly how much bounties were given out?

[25-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> 😃

[25-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I dont have the numbers but roughly I could say off the top of my head, less than 50k

[25-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah that doesn't explain the dump on exrates

[25-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> maybe less than 20 but

[25-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> yeah exactly

[25-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> still counting 😦

[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> almost 4 hours 😦

[25-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i thought maybe exrates was doing something shifty but we have all withdrawn our coins

[25-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Our mission might upset some people who make money from expensive houses

[25-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> makes no sense

[25-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> doubt its that

[25-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> @CombatWombat  probably withdraw is manual accepted 😄

[25-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> well someone is dumping at a massive loss to their own wallet

[25-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> that make sense 😄

[25-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah they are @!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽 they manually do it

[25-Jul-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> I've been bitten by a brown recluse twice and a hobo spider once. None of them survived the encounter, but my biggest tatoo is covering one of the scars.

[25-Jul-18 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> thank you

[25-Jul-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i know it was a white tail because they are common and the only ones Ive ever seen inside besides huntsman spiders

[25-Jul-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
