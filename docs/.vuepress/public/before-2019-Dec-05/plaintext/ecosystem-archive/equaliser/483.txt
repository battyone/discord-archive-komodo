[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> I guess maybe it's back to school time

[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> haha

[16-Oct-18 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> target markets

[16-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> I wonder if it actually works on some people lol

[16-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <tipsy_dev | auscoi> Actually it does, just like those Nigerian prince emails worked. Smart folks who can immediately spot the difference are not the target of those campaigns, but those who WOULD be duped by such things specifically are. Therefore it's a bit genius in its design where the only people who would actually fall for it would also be heavily in the range of a successful score.

[16-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Makes sense, they probably tell the person to pay them first before they "write the essay"

[16-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> maybe we ask her to write an essay on how to make money with fake bots

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Very hard waking up this morning

[16-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> At least it's not too cold when it's raining here now, being spring

[16-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Nice, it's fall here now. My favorite season üòÉ

[16-Oct-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I think a lot of people's favorite season is fall, it is mine

[16-Oct-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I love being able to leave windows of my house open overnight and sometimes during the day. Not only does it save on power but you get fresh air

[16-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Agreed

[16-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> would be nice to have cross ventilation in our domes!

[16-Oct-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> :EQLI:

[16-Oct-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> what do you mean by that @c2k

[16-Oct-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> pigbenis mentioned loving autumn because of the fresh air in his home.
just saying id like to own an eqli dome home and do the same

[16-Oct-18 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> currently city living = no house for me

[16-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> If there arent windows in the dome my wife would never let us live there haha

[16-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> yeah that would make for a depressing situation after a while

[16-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> wish this exchange would hit me back lol

[16-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Not a good start..

[16-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im not complaining

[16-Oct-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> its a free listing.

[16-Oct-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> what we need to do is get the price up a bit

[16-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> From what I read about domes..ventilation can be a challenge

[16-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> nah its not.. ventilation is easily accomplished with good ducting for the central heat and air system.

[16-Oct-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> FAE is always important but its easily accomplished.

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Can be fun dodging all the cars, but not in the rain

[16-Oct-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice

[16-Oct-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[16-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> n Australia, the average detached home now takes eight months to build; this is up from four-and-a-half months in 2000, according to the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. You might be wondering why this has increased and the answer is, in large part, due to larger and more complicated designs that take longer to build as well as overworked builders.

[16-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just read this

[16-Oct-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> interesting stuff

[16-Oct-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Eight months dang

[16-Oct-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> wow that is a long time lol

[16-Oct-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol what are they going to think when we come over and can throw up a cheaper, safer home in much less time? lol

[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Stress induced heart attacks I assume lol

[17-Oct-18 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Gonna shake it up everywhere hopefully

[17-Oct-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> True that

[17-Oct-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> that is the plan!

[17-Oct-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol once we get going, I want to get a show on tv.

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> im picking up some classes on coding, going to teach myself as much as I can so that i can contribute more to the EMP

[17-Oct-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Nice, javascript?

[17-Oct-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> What's EMP?  Electro magnetic pulse?

[17-Oct-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Electronic monitoring program?

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Equaliser Market Place

[17-Oct-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> Ahhh makes much more sense

[17-Oct-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> gonna start with javascript then move into C

[17-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> C#

[17-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I bought C# classes earlier this year

[17-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> and Python classes as well

[17-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Cool, I'm in between there with C++

[17-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Admin> Python is fun

[17-Oct-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Im going to try to learn all I can

[17-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <PigBenis> I started teaching myself python earlier this year and life happened and never got back to it

[17-Oct-18 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It is interesting

[17-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @CowboyCrypto I do c#

[17-Oct-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think any of the .Net languages are easier than most and visual studio is easy to use

[17-Oct-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> C is hard because you have to worry about memory management. I'd do and choose c# over c any day

[17-Oct-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If what type looking at is a whole sale system linked to the Equaliser chain them that's huge....UI, server side components plus back-end database..

[17-Oct-18 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Be easier to "buy" a point of sale system that already does that

[17-Oct-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Something similar to a "shop" on eBay, but where ppl pay with EQLI instead of $

[17-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> You can't build all that functionality from scratch...unless you have a team of devs

[17-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I just want to learn lol

[17-Oct-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I used to use qbasic in 2001 and I was pretty efficient with it. I know that‚Äôs nothing compared to other languages but I‚Äôm one of those ppl that can generally learn fast
