[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hey, y'all. We got a possible solution to anyone who is still getting stuck in native mode. It's a bit involved, and still being tested. But if it works, I'll be posting up a guide in short order.

[29-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As near as I can tell, SPV and new wallets are all fine now, but wallets with a balance might need some work.

[29-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> if you go back in time and see thetop 20 coins of 2014 or 2015 most of them if they  dont exist or are left forgotten 😒

[29-Jul-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> thats very true

[29-Jul-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but ofc they had like 25-50 coins in total
