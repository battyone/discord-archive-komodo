[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea

[13-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I was in Vienna last new years eve

[13-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> such a beautiful place.

[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> with the apfelstrudel

[13-Aug-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't have the money to travel around to a lot of places, but if I'm ever gonna be rich, I will probably visit a lot of places and I sure want to see the world out there

[13-Aug-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Very expensive to go any where from australia, Ive hardly travelled. Italy would be nice and a roadtrip around europe

[13-Aug-18 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I haven't really been out of country for holiday since I was like 10 or 11

[13-Aug-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But if I have a lot of money, I'm not going to have vacation trips like the typical tourist. I don't like the hot summer vacations that 90% of the people have

[13-Aug-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> well it depends which places you choose as a vacation

[13-Aug-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> global warming is already having and  impact making most of the places with ridiculous hot temperatures

[13-Aug-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> but yes I get your points

[13-Aug-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I alway's like those areas in movies where people go to the woods and there's a beatifull lake, not even alway's a lake, but just the forest and hills are so nice to see

[13-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> yea we sure need to preserve those parts of our world..

[13-Aug-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> they are very important

[13-Aug-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> you know if the price of eqli appears in agama wallet??

[13-Aug-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
