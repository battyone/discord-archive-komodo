[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Jeeez

[19-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Doing what?

[19-Aug-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I work at the Minnesota State Fair. I will be working overnights 5pm to 5am getting everything cleaned up around the fair

[19-Aug-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> so i will probably be a bit of a ghost for the next 2 weeks

[19-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I would love a job like that just to be around the atmosphere üòÉ you enjoying it or meh?

[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> most of the time it is a lot of fun

[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> overnights drag though

[19-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> after about 9 or 10pm it starts to drag a bit. plus side to overnights, you are guaranteed the full 12 hours, so i work till "5am", or whenever the work is finished, which could be 3am some nights

[19-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Gotta love the night shifts. I'm a casual safety inspector on mining sites, 6pm to 6am. I prefer nights personally

[19-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> that sounds interesting

[19-Aug-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I'm fine with overnights. just gets hard going from days to then even longer night shifts, and then back to days 2 weeks later lol

[19-Aug-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Constantly it wears you out for sure. I hope pay is worth it for you üòÉ

[19-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i could be getting paid more, but the hours are great right now. probably switching to a different job soon here, after this 2 weeks is done

[19-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> well, i will be back later! last 2 hours for today!

[19-Aug-18 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> enjoy it üëç have fun üòÉ

[19-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> This kaypad sometimes goes crazy on me lol

[19-Aug-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @AndronicusBass how's working at the mine treat you? There's a mine near me that pays well but I don't really think I'd fit well as a miner lol

[19-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> as long as it's a bitcoin mine

[19-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Haha I am sure it's a bitcoin mine

[19-Aug-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> It will be a gold mining site

[19-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Yeah they mine gold and copper near me I think

[19-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Oh I see

[19-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> I've done illegal mining here in the past. It's very common here where I come from. There are millions of chinses here doing illegal mining

[19-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Probably made bank lol

[19-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Not really cuz we got catch in the progress

[19-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> üòÇ

[19-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> That sucks lol

[19-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> It's a high risk thing to do here. It's either the bad police will come in and arrest you and take all your gold away

[19-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Or you get robber

[19-Aug-18 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> If I have the $$ I could get a bigger land pay off the chiefs, get some security to guard and pay the police then I am good to go

[19-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I like mines, cities make me anxious. Country boy at heart I be

[19-Aug-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üåüKQweci‚òÑ-Mod> Like a cali country boy style
