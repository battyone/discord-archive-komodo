[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Nice...Good to try a few

[27-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think the first will be the strongest as I‚Äôm gonna lay fiber mesh

[27-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I didn't know you could add stuff but if you could add steel then why not

[27-Aug-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I'm not an experienced builder but when I here fiber mesh and steel I think badass lol

[27-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> not going to add rebar as it is traditionally done, we are going to try some micro rebar, some fiber and other things of the sort to test strength and all that good stuff.

[27-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I think I may make up 3 blocks and shoot them lol

[27-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> they usually test different types of concrete for their strenght with pressure

[27-Aug-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> not bullets

[27-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Bullets are a form of pressure right? üòâ

[27-Aug-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[27-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> they use friggin hydraulic rams for that $hit

[27-Aug-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I just wanna shoot somethin

[27-Aug-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Nice quote for the level @CowboyCrypto- Founder üëç

[27-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> How many shootin ranges are in your neck of the woods?

[27-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol I live in missouri

[27-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> walk outside and shoot, lol noone will bat an eye.

[27-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> know why mass shootings dont happen here? we all have guns.

[27-Aug-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Congrats on ur level up @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[27-Aug-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> lol So I guess it's more lax than VA/TN

[27-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I can technically just gotta go to the sticks (not far) to do it

[27-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <üîÖmicaine10üîÖ> Good day

[27-Aug-18 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Good day @üîÖmicaine10üîÖ

[27-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> we have open carry here which is basically stating you need no permit to carry a firearm openly

[27-Aug-18 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> constitutional carry as well which says in this state you can conceal your firearm without recourse

[27-Aug-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Nice, maybe that would solve all these shootings we've had the past few years if all states followed suit

[27-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[27-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I wish... but people are all in a frenzy about it, not realizing the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is if a good guy has one there as well.

[27-Aug-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> even then it isnt guaranteed but its your best chance

[27-Aug-18 09:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> our rights to carry guns were not put in place for "bad guys" they were put in place for tyrannical government "bad guys"

[27-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> True to both of you

[27-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> speaking of gun laws. . do you know what they are in arkansas?

[27-Aug-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Our founding father didn't imagine automatic weapons either

[27-Aug-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @Jonathan-Mod so what . . if the government can have them to use against us, then we can have them to use against them

[27-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> arkansas is more expensive than MIssouri

[27-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'd rather not talk about tryin to fight the government

[27-Aug-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> just sayin

[27-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Was going to say that it doesn't really matter though, the right to protect yourself anywhere at anytime is paramount

[27-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I understand where you are coming from but some things we just leave out of conversation due to everyone having an opinion

[27-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Yep @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[27-Aug-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> ok, then stopping a bad guy that doesn't work for the government is "safe conversation" . . . got it

[27-Aug-18 10:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol .. love it

[27-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Anyone wanna talk about whose religion is better? üòÜ

[27-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> lol

[27-Aug-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Freaking love it here, just gotta say

[27-Aug-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just ordered some bad ass clamps for these forms. Im hella stoked to start dialing in the block recipe

[27-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Speak English @CowboyCrypto- Founder

[27-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol

[27-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I'll be pouring the first blocks to test this week

[27-Aug-18 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> I know what clamps are but not how it relates to that

[27-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> if you dont create a seal on the forms, then the aircrete will leak out, causing a collapse in the brick. kind of like a cake that isnt coojked thoroughly when the center collapses

[27-Aug-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Ahhhh ok

[27-Aug-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Andy mentioned earlier that there is a fire resistant form but would need approval, how's that work?

[27-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> is it possible to create moulds for every piece that will make up the home. The moulds are reusable and  can be poured whilst they're laying on the ground. pour...dry...then assemble upright into the shape of the home.

[27-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> can then mass produce standard homes

[27-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> customizable ones will be more expensive and ok as long as the buyer is willing to pay for the custom job

[27-Aug-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> so much potential

[27-Aug-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> could even pour different ratio of concrete mixes depending on what part of the home it is

[27-Aug-18 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> eg, if it's the bottom bits or support bits then mix the ratio so that they're stronger.

[27-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> and the 'roofing' type bits a bit lighter mix as they don't need the same level of strength

[27-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I'd have to refer to an engineer in regards to the dome structure...

[27-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> maybe in a dome strucutre all parts need to be of equal strenght to give lateral support as well as vertical support.

[27-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Also may required a slab with some steel uprights that the dome will cement into as the base, so that the bottom of the dome doesn't 'slip' wider from vertical pressure.

[27-Aug-18 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Llama-Admin> what's the ETA on my home?

[27-Aug-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> oh well time for me to go to work noow

[27-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> @CowboyCrypto- Founder you said homes are cheaper in missouri than arkansas ?

[28-Aug-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Eh it depends on where you‚Äôre at

[28-Aug-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> If you‚Äôre lookin northwest ar it can get pricey

[28-Aug-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Northeast is  a war zone

[28-Aug-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> But if you get a bit east of Rogers, it‚Äôs rural and inexpensive

[28-Aug-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå  to answer your question buddy, the best way to do it is to make a few different sized blocks

[28-Aug-18 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MySoulisNotForSale> what warzone

[28-Aug-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
