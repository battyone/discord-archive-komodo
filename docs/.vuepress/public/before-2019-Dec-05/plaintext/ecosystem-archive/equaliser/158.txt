[23-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> well I will assume most of us don't want to trade on exrates at the moment

[23-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol and barterdex is complicated plus has low volume

[23-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> that is true

[23-Jul-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[23-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> give it a bit. We have some things in mind, but want to be sure Exrates is sorted before we go too crazy 😄

[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> exrates site keeps going down, normally I would say that's bad but this time it's good hopefully it means they are working on upgrades
