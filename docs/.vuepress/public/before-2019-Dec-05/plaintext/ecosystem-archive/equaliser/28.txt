[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> very interesting to know some of your background cowboy

[06-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Yeah

[06-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Transparency is respected in this space. Not a lot of it these days.

[06-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I no longer invest in coins unless I can see the dev team.. and I no longer use exchanges that don't have a transparent team. Been scammed twice I think that's enough lol

[06-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Alot of exchanges are dodgy. The worst one I have heard of is Yobit

[06-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> I agree. I have been a victim and have most $$$

[06-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> Yeah I hear that is real dodgy but I used it a couple of times for a crap coin but had no problems. I lost btc on exvo exchange

[06-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> its gone now

[06-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <🌟🌟☄KQweci🌟🌟☄> Sometimes they open up communication and get lost later

[06-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Novaexchange is weird too

[06-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> So trading from the safety of your wallet with barterdex and hyperdex is amazing.

[06-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> that coin I bought on yobit had a wallet update but they would not reply to the devs and they tried for over a month

[06-Jul-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i have heard that has happened a fair bit with yobit yet for some reason people still use it and it has decent volume

[06-Jul-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> makes no sense

[06-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Its important to DYOR. I learned fundamental analysis as I enjoy research as a hobby too

[06-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I researched economics and monetary history

[06-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yep always DYOR because everyone is an expert on cryptos lol

[06-Jul-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> i'm just concentrating on cryptos at the moment

[06-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> 😂

[06-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> i would advise learning economic fundamentals and the current state of the global economy if you are into crypto 😃

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> You dont have to but just my advice

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I'm am expert in crypto

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I love everything about crypto so far. it is sooooo early.

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> You guys are informative

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <donaldmathers> Thank you

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I do exactly 15 second lf research on,reddit before investing in,anything 😂

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> haha super scanner!!!

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> scan reddit and boom!

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> I know the basics but I see cryptos as doing it's own thing.. not following basic principles which is why I don't bother with ta

[06-Jul-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but that's just me

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> some people swear by ta

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I base my investments much more on FA than TA

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Ahaha no but seriously I do hours of research loo

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> you can only use TA short term in my experience

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah fa is good

[06-Jul-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe a mix of fa and ta

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> but so far the "ta experts" don't do the best job lol

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> @CowboyCrypto same here TA is for day trading for me...but I don't even do that anymore, now I do pure TA, invest, and wait

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> In Australia we have an outdated tax benefit people use to claim a loss on investment property to pay less income tax. That benefit was brought in the 80's to stimulate property investment when interest rates were above 10%. It is outdated now that interest rates are lowest ever and property investment is a non productive form of investment as less spending in the economy and less tax income for the government to put towards job creation and infrastructure of increasing populations

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> maybe when we have much higher volume and things stabilize ta could be more useful... i dunno

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> heaps of things are outdated in Australia lol

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> honestly one of the best TA guys i saw on twitter was Kazonomics, he blocked me cuz he's went mental I think, but the guy is a beast at calling trades.

[06-Jul-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> I've found that long term investments outpay short plays 95% of,the time

[06-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> nbn 🤦

[06-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Politicians use it too so they have a conflict of interest to not let property prices deflate to their average mean
