[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> no way essendon can come back from so far behind now

[dscrdeql] <boaler> @‚úåJellysmash‚úå hi, i do not understand.

[17-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> are you a supporter of Essendon

[17-Aug-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> looks like Essendon have come back again a bit towards end of 3rd quarter

[17-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they might still have a chance to win

[17-Aug-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> But Richmond just seem to be all over them

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Not much happening with the EQLI price today on exrates

[17-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> fairly static movement

[17-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> vaguely remember @Biomech-Founder saying a while back that there was some discussions with xrates for them to reduce the withdrawal fee for EQLI - or was i imaging that ?

[17-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I did

[17-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> haha...never gets tired

[17-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> @miles the withdrawal fee from exrates is very high

[17-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I thought there must have been some mistake on my first withdrawal cause it was so high

[17-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> they do withdrawals manually though

[17-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I think I read somewhere that theywill automate it eventually

[17-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> but since it's manual, it can take them a while to do it

[17-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> hence I've had to wait up to a day a couple of times now for withdrawal to reach my wallet

[17-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I didn't realise that one of the founders was going to have a word to them about that fee being so high

[17-Aug-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> If it's an automated system then there'd be no reason for it to be high at all

[17-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> @miles are you a story book writer? üòÇ

[17-Aug-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Aug-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yea, they're pretty hgih

[17-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> its the only way!!

[17-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> yep, since only exchange at the momment you can trade EQLI

[17-Aug-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Hopefully that'll change over time

[17-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I saw that Tweet about binance and who they list or do not list

[17-Aug-18 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <boaler> congrats for level up

[17-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> may i have time to do that also faster.

[17-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <boaler> but iam not sure if i should do that. if iam again level 10 ...reset again?

[17-Aug-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I don't think they 'd keep resetting all the time

[17-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> did i see something about rains when so many people reach level 5 and level 15?\

[17-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> assume that means there wont be a reset anytime soon again!!

[17-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> @AndronicusBass-Founder question about buying houses with EQLI when you get to that point - how will the price be set in terms pegging amount of EQLI to local equivalent FIAT ? Or is tor is that not the way it will work?

[17-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> just curious to know how you can deal with mad crypto and fiat currency fluctuations going on in the world at the moment

[17-Aug-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Eqli won't be pegged to anything

[17-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> how would determine the price of a house ?

[17-Aug-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> sorry, how would you

[17-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Price of a home is where you want it built and price of local materials. Size of build and options required.

[17-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> ok - so if i understand, so  - although not pegged - it will be aligned to local FIAT costs at the time ? And the amount of EQLI set accoddingly?

[17-Aug-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Both parties agree on the same amount of eqli to build.

[17-Aug-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> understood - and can that house only ever be sold via EQLI because the title is on the chain?
