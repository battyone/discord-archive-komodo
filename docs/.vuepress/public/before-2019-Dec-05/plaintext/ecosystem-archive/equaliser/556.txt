[09-Jul-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not much. Cypher and I both had family issues to deal with. Sorry for the late reply. We will be back in the saddle shortly. here

[dscrdeql] <nille> good afternoon all

[12-Jul-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day everyone

[13-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> here Mornin' y'all. Cypher is more or less back on track, we'll restart planning over this weekend. The team apologizes for the delay, but life intervened and there's only so many ways to split your life ðŸ˜„ At any rate, here's a little teaser, if not exactly new information. The new direction is going to be focused on smart contracts, both CC and basic blockchain API commands being manipulated. This means that we'll be developing software that will be of beneifit to ALL crypto projects, which will hopefully get enough interest and revenue moving to get back to our main goal of affordable housing for people who desperately need it. This will be a long term project, expect slow growth. The mechanics are still being planned. Y'all have a great day!

[13-Jul-19 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> thanks for the update biomech ðŸ‘Œ

[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto> I hate to be the bearer of bad news ladies and gents, but I just got this email. 

Hello,



Hope you doing well!

I am contacting to let you know that minimum required daily volume for each trading pair is $500.

Please, pay attention on it. If nothing will change in next few days we will start delisting process.



Kind regards,

Sancho
