[09-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> ill aim for once a week

[09-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> until i get more

[09-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> then maybe twice a week

[09-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> how much is the trans fee?

[09-Aug-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> does it differ or fixed fee?

[09-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <NWhiskeyTango> If you like i think 1200 KMD you get 1 a week from interest. Don't know how much the fee is

[09-Aug-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> i wish i had that much haha

[09-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> fee is .0001 per kb.

[09-Aug-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> so if it's all in one address, .0001 😄

[09-Aug-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> Ah OK cool I might wait a bit more because I got two separate transactions

[09-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> if you click on the claim button, it shows you the detail and gives you the chance to back out.

[09-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> Ah OK sweet thanks didn't know that

[09-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I'll have a look

[09-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> Oh and lite mode didn't work again I just closed agama then opened it and it worked

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Not sure what's up with that. Been having the same issue, but the servers are up.

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> So if anyone had the problem just shut the wallet down and should be good to go after that

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> in lite mode it may take a min or so to update...so have a lil p;atience

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> Nah it wouldn't connect to eql

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> My electicity cut off so had to restart all wallets lol

[09-Aug-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> First world problems 😬

[09-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> also, on the claiming interest, you can automate it with the command line pinned in this channel.

[09-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> In windows, you can do it with a scheduled batch file 😄

[09-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat-Mod> I'll just do things manually

[09-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
