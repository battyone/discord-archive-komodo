[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Kind of a pain to make the change, but they did have it first. Granted, by maybe a day or two, but still. Fair's fair.

[05-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <luisalexandermg> ok then it will be called EQLI yes? I was going to ask that because in coinmarketcap there is a currency already called EQL thanks for the information, please, please inform in which exchanges EQLI could be listed?
@Cypher - Founder

[05-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> At this time, we are in negotiation with several exchanges. We can't publicly disclose which ones yet, due to their policies and a desire to not poison the talks.

[05-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> As soon as we have something solid AND permission to announce it, we'll shout it from the rooftops üòÑ

[05-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Cypher - Founder> haha he  beat me to it xD üòÉ

[05-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Jul-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
