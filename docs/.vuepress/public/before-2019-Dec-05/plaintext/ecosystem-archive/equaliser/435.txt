[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Poutine

[17-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> The occasional food pic is ok but when everyone is posting them, it gets tiring after a while and makes one hungry all the time LOL

[17-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Poutine is da bomb.

[17-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> You in Canada?

[17-Sep-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nah I‚Äôm in the Ozarks

[17-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Laundering money with Jason Bateman?

[17-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nah that‚Äôs a bit north of me

[17-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Pretty sure that show is actually filmed in Georgia anyway

[17-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it‚Äôs not here

[17-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> The ozarks have a very distinctive look

[17-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> It‚Äôs a decent show though

[17-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> And that lake is so ridiculously busy they‚Äôd never get a solid shot

[17-Sep-18 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm in Branson

[17-Sep-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I am currently in Chicago but headed back to Augusta tomorrow

[17-Sep-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I like to look at tip 100 EQLI richlist....

[17-Sep-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Looks like something has happened

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Within about 12 hours my address has gone up from the 50s to the 20s

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Ord is a pain lol

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Someone has withdrawn a lot of EQLI from multiple addresses

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Yeah I have TSA precheck so hopefully that helps me

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs me

[17-Sep-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Oh, ok

[17-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I‚Äôm consolidating a few for some things lol

[17-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Good eye though

[17-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I did that at noon

[17-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> that richlist doesn‚Äôt show the EQLI that I have stored in exrates either right?

[17-Sep-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah it should

[17-Sep-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It‚Äôs a wallet address

[17-Sep-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Interesting, I will have to take a look to see where i stand

[17-Sep-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> They just own the keys

[17-Sep-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I withdraw almost all I buy on there

[17-Sep-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I probably should, I just hate wasting that 0.5%

[17-Sep-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Yeah

[17-Sep-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I get it

[17-Sep-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Doesn‚Äôt seem like mine shows up, at least not all in one address

[17-Sep-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I would be between 14 and 15 if it was all in one

[17-Sep-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Nice

[17-Sep-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Your a whale  @Zach

[17-Sep-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Actually I don‚Äôt see my address from here on there either

[17-Sep-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Look it up on explore-Equaliser.io

[17-Sep-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just put your wallet address in

[17-Sep-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Unless they are splitting all of them

[17-Sep-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just a heads up, you‚Äôre going to want them in your own wallet

[17-Sep-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Yea, not good top leave on the exchange

[17-Sep-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> I still have a few hundred k left on exchange I need to move to my agama wallet

[17-Sep-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I am too tired to figure this out right now, I will take another look tomorrow

[17-Sep-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <‚úåJellysmash‚úå> Cool

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Supposedly a cold suppressant, not so much.

[17-Sep-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Ahh ok

[17-Sep-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Personally I just ride them out. On a cold night though, a whisky mac with the correct measurements helps a good sleep when you have a cold üëç

[17-Sep-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Jonathan-Mod> Yeah think I'll do that tomorrow, beer helped with sleep but not the cough.....gonna load up on B12 in the morning, much work to be done
