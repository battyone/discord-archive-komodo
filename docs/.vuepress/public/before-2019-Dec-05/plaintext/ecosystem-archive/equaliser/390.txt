[30-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> How come exrates has a high withdraw fee?

[30-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Podmaster> To get your monies?

[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they have a high withdraw fee for reasons unknown, but we are seeking other exchanges that are more used. their numbers seem to be purely wash trading

[30-Aug-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Are you allowed to tell which exchanges ask how much to be listed?

[30-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> cryptopia is used a lot.  they seem ok...i've used them a bit

[30-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> don't know how much it costs to list on it

[30-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> crypto-bridge is a new-ish exchange...costs around 1btc to list I think

[30-Aug-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <âœŒJellysmashâœŒ> but I hate having to use their special coin to put a buy or sell order in and if you cancel it you still have to pay a fee.  that sucks, but it does force people to keep orders and not chop and change too much.  maybe slightly more stable in maintaining coin price

[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think anything that's anti user friendly should be avoided if possible, but I still think it would be best to be listed where possible

[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But yeah, using a special coin to pay for the fee sucks

[30-Aug-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I don't mind paying a fee or stuff like that, it's just bs to let users use their coin to pay for the fee. No need for that at all

[30-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Like on binance, I know the fee is a bit lower if you use their coin, but I'd rather pay the little more to buy, then to buy their coin first and use that

[30-Aug-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I'm using cryptopia a lot. Sometimes I hear someone about it now and then, but overall they seem pretty good

[30-Aug-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I gotta go sleep for now so I won't be reading up until tomorrow, unless the room is somehow flooded with hours of stuff to read haha
