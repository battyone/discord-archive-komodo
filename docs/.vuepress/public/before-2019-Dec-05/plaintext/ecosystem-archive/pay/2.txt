Topic: 칒Pay is an Android and IOS app from 칒 Crypto Union that will allow users to collateralise their Komodo to receive a line of credit in the fiat currency of their choice*. In recent months, 칒 has worked closely with Indenodes to bring 칒Pay and the other financial services that 칒 provides to the Komodo ecosystem. Beginning with Kmd integration within the app, 칒 also plans to release a stable coin backed by secured debt through an asset-chain as well as the migration of our security token unto the Komodo platform and much more. https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

no worry mate

[15-Jan-19 11:20 AM] Fab칒#8941
we will swap your GXE

[15-Jan-19 11:20 AM] Fab칒#8941
even if it takes a little bite of time

[16-Jan-19 07:35 AM] Ludom#5832
I continue to give this advise: use your own address when you need to swap, participate to ICO or buy things.

Thanks Guys

[16-Jan-19 04:24 PM] Fab칒#8941
talking to Anton and CLaudio of  Digitalprice

[16-Jan-19 04:25 PM] Fab칒#8941
they could list all the tokens against KSB (usd) for a 5btc listing price

[16-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Fab칒#8941
could be done if we find a way to all the project  can contribute partially for it

[16-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Fab칒#8941
as it will create a fiat gateway

[16-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Fab칒#8941
KSB is a stable coin

[16-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Fab칒#8941
so we dont keep any supply for ourselves

[16-Jan-19 04:26 PM] Fab칒#8941
and the peg is 1/1

[16-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Fab칒#8941
so we can't do this alone

I'm very confused about the fiat gate way into digital price

[16-Jan-19 05:48 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
for 5 btc I would also require to list again Hush

[16-Jan-19 05:48 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Berg what do you say?

[16-Jan-19 05:49 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
this requires a coordinated crowdfuning

[16-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Fab칒#8941
agreed @KomodoWorld

[16-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Fab칒#8941
Digital Price, Anton and CLaudio said that they will list all the existing tokens present on digitaprice against KSB

[16-Jan-19 05:57 PM] Fab칒#8941
so all of them will be pair with a stable coin and offer a way in and out in Fiat (gbp/aud/euro/usd)

[16-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Fab칒#8941
I agreed a Pooling will resolve the question of the 5btc

[16-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Fab칒#8941
pooling versus crowdfunding whatever is best for all the parties

[16-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Fab칒#8941
who could be escrow?

[16-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Fab칒#8941
this is also very attractive to display that all the assetchain being listed in digitalprice could also access fiat gateway

[16-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Fab칒#8941
and a stablecoin

[16-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Fab칒#8941

[16-Jan-19 06:14 PM] Fab칒#8941
So from what I gathered this stablecoin FIat gateway solution on DP exchange could be an interesting feature for #pirate #verus #lumber #hush #coincollect and #coqui

Whitepaper:
https://ksb.money/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/KSB-Whitepaper-v0.1.pdf

IMO the interesting are: #1 no conflict of interest (no supply kept), #2 totally atomize
the underlying assets are T-bills and secured promissory notes (basically debtors and creditors) so banks can disappear
OCU can disappear does not kill it

@Fab칒 i still dont understand if i have 춲100, how can i get it on to digitial price without fee or minimal fee. At the moment the only way is though coin base and they charge 4% to deposit and it cost a lot to withdraw bitcoin from digital price.

[16-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Fab칒#8941
we charge 1% for most money including the pound

[16-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Fab칒#8941
you get your KSB right away

[16-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Fab칒#8941
(max few hours)

[16-Jan-19 06:28 PM] Fab칒#8941
you transfer your ksb to DP and you can buy anything you want

[16-Jan-19 06:29 PM] Fab칒#8941
KSB is acting here as a gateway

[16-Jan-19 06:29 PM] Fab칒#8941
we just need to proceed with the listing of all the coins with DP

[16-Jan-19 06:30 PM] Fab칒#8941
my thinking is that we need outside money to all growth

[16-Jan-19 06:30 PM] Fab칒#8941
we need to all X doors and bridges

[16-Jan-19 06:31 PM] Fab칒#8941
people want know that they can go in and out fairly easily, store in a safe way without having to withdraw and go through their banks

[16-Jan-19 06:49 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
this is a good idea

[16-Jan-19 06:49 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
i will try it out when it becomes available on digital price.

[16-Jan-19 06:54 PM] Fab칒#8941

[16-Jan-19 06:56 PM] Ludom#5832
And you didn't mention the possibility of KSB+ when the Lombard credits will be open

[16-Jan-19 07:02 PM] Ludom#5832
KSB is a financial tool

[16-Jan-19 07:03 PM] Ludom#5832
It's a stable coin but it'll open possibility to buy dept and receive the interest.

[16-Jan-19 07:13 PM] Fab칒#8941

Does any of that 1% ksb fee go to our holders 游땵

[17-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Ludom#5832
First the 1% KSB fee are used to pay expenses of the company and further development. But if there is benefit,  it would be dividends to OUR hollders

[17-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Ludom#5832
OUR are normal company shares

[17-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Ludom#5832
And the income from Bank Services benefits to the company, owned by OUR holders

[17-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Ludom#5832
Nothing tricky

[17-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Fab칒#8941
Thanks @Ludom yep as a Credit Union all profit will be equally redistribute among our member and tokens holders

May be good to propagate the fix to at least beta (for notarizing)
Better to master
Of course I say that I have no idea of the  difficulty to do this
