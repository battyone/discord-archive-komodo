@MagnaDev  you chain is stalled 😂

[29-Nov-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
difficulty is massive ... and no blocks happening

[29-Nov-18 02:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you might want to get a pool up... so that it can be unstuck with hash power from time to time maybe ?

[29-Nov-18 02:41 AM] bishop#9773
@blackjok3r you sure, looks like blocks are flowing

[29-Nov-18 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my transaction was unconfirmed for liek 15 mins

maybe i was just impatient

[29-Nov-18 02:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats a LONG time wihtout blocks though

[29-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
PoS is meant to be max 384s

[29-Nov-18 02:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe there is a bug with it ...

[29-Nov-18 02:44 AM] bishop#9773
I'm too lazy to do the math but it looks like it is at that extreme

[29-Nov-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
not max 384 seconds, just a new method starts after a delay. depending on chain diff, utxo details, it can still take 10 minutes or more

[29-Nov-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
time just passed by as N*N instead of N

[29-Nov-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh, I hav ejust never seen it be more than 384s ... mayeb the difficulty wasnt high enough.

[29-Nov-18 01:19 PM] gef#9796
for me it seems everything looks ok http://mgnx.explorer.dexstats.info/blocks

Does this mean I need to do anything for my wallet? Just load and rescan?

[11-Jan-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```bash
Via command line:

komodo-cli -ac_name=MGNX getblockhash 178455

via Agama "cli" in options section:

getblockhash 178455

should be the return or you're on the wrong fork```

[12-Jan-19 04:36 PM] jasonabis#8549
Oy. I got:

Error code: -8
Block height out of range

[12-Jan-19 04:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
You might have a forked chain

[12-Jan-19 04:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
Resync or bootstrap

[12-Jan-19 04:38 PM] jasonabis#8549
Don't know how to bootstrap. When I loaded the wallet, I did the resync with disk option.
