Keep getting a -1, check rpc error even though nothing has changed on my setup. Restarted the daemon w/ params, try to query getinfo and stops as it is activating chain.

[13-Oct-18 12:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`-1, check rpc error` ?
can you copy/paste what you mean?

[13-Oct-18 12:55 AM] bishop#9773
`error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)
`

[13-Oct-18 12:56 AM] bishop#9773
and I have tried rerunning the daemon w/ params over and over again and see it loading blocks but stalls out on activating chain. I guess I could resync it if no one has any suggestions

[13-Oct-18 01:03 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by "stalls" do you mean you're looking at a tail of debug.log and it just sits there, or are you going by daemon print alone?

any last minute ideas before I purge the chain and start fresh?

[13-Oct-18 01:11 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if it's truly stalling, dump the chain and the peers.dat and try again, maybe

[13-Oct-18 01:12 AM] bishop#9773
Wasn't sure if something happened at 48977 that caused this

@Mark81 If a pool gets made, one thing to keep in mind is that PoW is only 10% of the chain

Right now how you can else acquire coins if not mining mgnx? There is no exchange for that has liquidity.

any idea why chain got stuck at block 48977? just resynced and did same again.

[15-Oct-18 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's possible that some new ruleset of dPoW isn't working with MGNX, @MagnaDev

[15-Oct-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, given the date of the 12th for that block, I wouldn't think so...

[15-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Mark81#4505
basically komodod stopped syncing and returned to cli. Last information was: KOMODO_CONNECTING.48978 mempool.1

That I don't know, I never mess with those builds; you may need a more updated one
Have you tried the one packaged with the latest Agama?

[15-Oct-18 03:34 PM] Mark81#4505
no. its even shitty slow sync with windows when comparing linux sync

[15-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Mark81#4505
windows 10 hyper-v ubuntu virtual pc syncs faster than directly from host windows  runned komodod

[15-Oct-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`its even shitty slow sync with windows when comparing linux sync` That's a given with how Win "handles" sockets

[15-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Mark81#4505
well i dont know how hyper-v can sync faster when it goes through windows?

[15-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Mark81#4505
it uses windows resources.

[15-Oct-18 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because it mostly goes *around* win and not through it - in the shortest of answers

[15-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Mark81#4505
yeah but meant it creates for that instance its own  network connection? i would assume that windows handles that traffic.

[15-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If it does, then the vm engine is screwed

[15-Oct-18 03:42 PM] Mark81#4505
well i just assume without better knowledge... anyway hyper-v is nice feature and is able to un solid ubuntu with all  features. also any other OS when needed.

[15-Oct-18 03:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not without issues, but it's better than Win alone

With Alright possibly the highest block producer, maybe he updated to a really new version and forked it ?

Last I heard before he went on vacation his node wouldnt stake any more so ... maybe not.

[16-Oct-18 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
turns out without some kind of method, if you wa whale ..  the wallet will break if you dont tend to it 😂

[16-Oct-18 01:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r It can't be that, I'm running same as the explorer
something in the ruleset is the only thing I can think of

hmmm... never had or ran MGNX here... weird

[16-Oct-18 01:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
need to see what TXs are in that block, and what its rejecting.

@MagnaDev I just read your whitepaper. Interesting idea. I like your governance proposal methodologies. About your n^2 voting method to prevent whale manipulation, couldn't the whales just create 100 wallets, register them, then buy 1 vote from each wallet?

[16-Oct-18 02:58 AM] wookie#7663
I have a question: is your business idea to build a front end that looks like a DEX, but in the backend is based on BarterDEX? with MGNX as the intermdediate exchange token?

the build included in agama likely has different rules in it's contracts than latest dev branch?

🤷

[16-Oct-18 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
what contract made the tx I posted above?

[16-Oct-18 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
trying to figure that out

[16-Oct-18 03:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, the last bits (4d61676e61) of the 0.000 part decodes to 'Magna`

[16-Oct-18 03:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
beyond that, I'm too close to 🛏 to tell much

[16-Oct-18 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
likewise, don't feel like looking through each contract's vins and vouts to figure out what that is

[16-Oct-18 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c is it possible to determine what contract made that tx based on its OP_RETURN?

[16-Oct-18 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
`ec444d36c49e1d2bf548682e94d8908a5b445792d94ae9cba7fa5c4c4b6dfe7c2a5f550d9b1542c7687a2ab959475c2ce1c4965dbd1b2348d368603b23801f9760112102c8d20b20744be990f39f884b973609ea2539293c47c1f844b9ceecb982a90e2806054d61676e61`

[16-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
I believe the build included with agama is rejecting that tx in particular

[16-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
just not sure why

[16-Oct-18 03:43 AM] Alright#0419
although this `KOMODO_CONNECTING.48978 mempool.1` indicates that it spent an input that other nodes don't see as valid? I think?

[16-Oct-18 03:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
simple solution would be for Magna to have an Agama fork to ensure daemon is always updated with any PoS updates

[16-Oct-18 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't have to deal with POS stuff, they have contracts activated that are still in testing

[16-Oct-18 03:45 AM] Alright#0419
changing, even hard forking occasionally

[16-Oct-18 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, but what I mean is that since Agama (proper) is usually a build of master, it's not always a good idea to rely on it being what MGNX "needs"

[16-Oct-18 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
hierarchy and all that

[16-Oct-18 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i think dev branch would have the matched set of CC rules

[16-Oct-18 10:56 AM] MagnaDev#7112
@wookie 

The backend is based on the token DEX CC, where anyone can create, trade and exchange using the colored token system setup by KMD.  

In regards to the voting system, checks would have to be put in place to prevent clear abuse and multi-voting. Some steps that could be taken: 
1) Take steps to monitor and mitigate multi-voting from the actual platform . We could ban VPNs and detect for any suspicious activity coming from the same IP. 
2) Add voting requirements, which can then be included when signing for an address. For example, we could add a Discord alias, a link to a social media account that must tweet out MGN / MGNX at least once. We could add requirements that the accounts are at least a certain age, before being used as another form of authentication. The message signing  is flexible and not solely limited to verifying a single piece of information.

[16-Oct-18 04:20 PM] wookie#7663
@MagnaDev Thanks for extensive reply explaining your voting system. I'm still curious about the front end business idea of MGNX. This is an interesting model (if I'm understanding it correctly), is the project going to be running a DEX? But instead of hosting and building one, just have MGNX as the intermediary exchange token that's being atomic-swapped between customer orders on the front end and on the kmd DEX on the backend? If that's so, that is quite clever imho.

[17-Oct-18 05:18 AM] AncientHodler™#9706
hello people, didnt knew a mgnx chanell exists on the komodo discord

[17-Oct-18 06:11 PM] MagnaDev#7112
Yes, it's taking advantage of the DEX already built into the MGNX asset chain with CC.  

See these RPC commands for reference:
```tokenaddress [pubkey]
tokenask numtokens tokenid price
tokenbalance tokenid [pubkey]
tokenbid numtokens tokenid price
tokencancelask tokenid asktxid
tokencancelbid tokenid bidtxid
tokenconvert evalcode tokenid pubkey amount
tokencreate name supply description
tokenfillask tokenid asktxid fillunits
tokenfillbid tokenid bidtxid fillamount
tokeninfo tokenid
tokenlist
tokenorders [tokenid]
tokentransfer tokenid destpubkey amount```

We would create the front end to simplify the token creation process. MGNX would be the currency that each token is pegged to when trading.
