we already tested this on RKT test chain and it works

[07-Dec-18 05:05 PM] SHossain#0007
more details and guides will be coming soon after the upgrade is done

@Deleted User Beautiful GUI (I know you made everything but the GUI 😂 )

[07-Dec-18 07:21 PM] zatJUM#9924
It shouldn't be "(PIRATE)" but "(ARRR)", as it's "OOT"

[07-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah on this version few typo should be changed

A bit of news here, this was a pretty big week, not much coding, but I had the opportunity to speak with crypto people / investors / devs at a meetup in belgium.

Backend part is ready for first testing phase, expected for next week.

First wave of invites will be sent mainly on this channel.

@Deleted User awesome, excited to test it out

Here we are, time for me to build on clean servers, now the testing phase approaches. New servers ordered

[20-Dec-18 08:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Managed to migrate the 6 servers overnight on brand new servers. As I pushed older ones to the limit, and damaged one of em running tests, I didn t want to take risks so just reinstalled and splitted everything.

The good point is now I have a strong howto for install and don t need to rely on billions of textfiles everywhere :p

[20-Dec-18 08:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Some coins are still in sync but it should be okay.

[20-Dec-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe I ll have to skip some to get a very secure setup : last servers were pushed up to 90% hdd use with manual forcing for raid 0 xD

[20-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
As most chain have sapling activated, the bottleneck for z is mostly gone. That will also require some tweaking to get the correct address gen (sprout vs sapling)

[21-Dec-18 06:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Finished syncing xsg rvn ltc dash and pivx. 
Eth also.

Only operation remaining before private launch is tweaking the Z addys and retest eth. Will end everything in 1h

Hello there, most information sits on Barterlly s discord. A bridge will be made with this chan in the coming weeks. 

we re finishing the orderbook and am also finishing the whole infra. the bank account is opened and we can fully operate.

Those last months were pretty hard and here again... am candidating for a NN to fund barterlly for servers and such, so have to be some sort of octopus. Don t worry, the objective is still April ;)

Hello everyone :).
As some of you may already know, this year, I'm candidating for a node in **SH region**.
The past year has been very nice : I learned so much thanks to you all who supported me, it was really amazing.
So amazing that I try to contribute more and more, and to find ideas that could help the community. This led me to the creation of a project called **Barterlly**, and here's the true reason behind my proposal : 
I believe this app, and its future versions can be the starting point of something very useful for the community and help spread the word and attract users and devs into KMD ecosystem : Any dpowed assetchain / coin will automatically be listed on the platform (and all "derivative" ones yet to come ;) )

I won't go into tech details on this post, and will just wish you a good election time, but don't forget ! 

**Support Barterlly, Vote for dwy !** :

The call with the lawyer will tell me what I can / can not do, and give me the full path to get something non intrusive, yet secure for everyone

[14-May-19 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd love to know both options 🙂

[14-May-19 06:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
those informations are vital and sensitive to users, atm, we gather some personal data, like email, and are GDPR compliant, but the first or last name are even more sensitive and far more important than an email address. I know there are options where you can find a trusted partner that validates your accounts, and return results via API. But that type of solution, to be compliant by law, need to be checked, and notified in ToS and other legal disclaimers.

[14-May-19 06:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
I need to compare everything to find the most secure way

[14-May-19 06:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
a Jumio style would fit, but tbh not knowing the election results, I had to handle the infra costs... at all costs. Most important thing to me was to be able to launch asap being compliant.

[14-May-19 06:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now we know that the whole infrastructure will be funded for a year we can begin to work on additionnal levels.

[14-May-19 06:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I could just handle those data myself, but i REALLY want to avoid to handle the storage of ID cards etc... That's not the core of Barterlly, and I want to find the best solution for user privacy and keep everything completely compliant.

Asking the community about their experience on different KYC partners could also be a good option.

[14-May-19 06:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not registered everywhere (I mean personally, I passed KYC on Bittrex, and Kraken, but not other exchanges), and process differs depending on platforms. I will rush into anything related to technical stuff, but when it comes to compliance, I want to go step by step even if it needs more time.

[14-May-19 05:40 PM] Llama#1330
Is there a cap on volume if you don’t kyc, or does it force you to KYC if you get past it?

[14-May-19 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
the cap per day without KYC is 10€k a day

we opened back few days ago

[28-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So you put up an offer

[28-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then it's publicised

[28-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
once someone accepts the offer you deposit the funds you put up for sale in an adress

[28-May-19 08:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and not before?

[28-May-19 08:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so barterlly doesnt act as an escrow?

[28-May-19 08:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
arent you afraid you will get a lot of fake offers like that?

[28-May-19 08:45 AM] Oszy#5734
pre-deposit, before offer is accepted, that could speed up the process, and could be a feature, where offer is marked as "transaction is ready to complete" or something.
and if you want to withdraw the offer you could get a refund of your deposit (minus tx fee ofc)

if you have a look 95% of the current offers are insanely stupid, but because there are no deposits in place, no one can make a "bad" trade by accident, unlike you could in hyperdex.

[28-May-19 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[29-May-19 03:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
there are 2 things to consider

[29-May-19 03:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
1) we re still in beta so yeah people test with crazy offers but those offzrs will tend to be drown on the masses of real offers when we will reach more users. Because people seeing it works will just want their offers to be fulfilled.

[29-May-19 03:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
a simple example is... a CEX : you can try to buy KMD for 0.0001 cent or sell at 4 btc each. Noone will answer

[29-May-19 03:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Barterlly isn t different and we can t enforce rates or max spread

[29-May-19 03:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
this would defeat the OTC concept
What is possible, is an option to autocalculate the target coin price when placing the order, on the user side it s just a checkbox, but internally this requires having a pricefeed for every coin listed

[29-May-19 03:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
2) Prefilling, I know it can be done in less than a day, on tech side of things
