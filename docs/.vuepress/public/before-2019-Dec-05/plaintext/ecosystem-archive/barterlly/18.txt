to allow any 3rd party to interact with us and make swaps even via CLI

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
after this, optimizing, and adding coins

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
we have a lot of ideas for next steps

[28-Nov-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
and maybe side projects

FYI BTC addresses also have checksum'ing but it's not commonly checked by applications: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding

Base58Check encoding

[28-Nov-18 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
```(Beware of bignumber implementations that clip leading 0x00 bytes, or prepend extra 0x00 bytes to indicate sign - your code must handle these cases properly or else you may generate valid-looking addresses which can be sent to, but cannot be spent from - which would lead to the permanent loss of coins.)```

[28-Nov-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
seems that even btc core allows sending to invalid checksum addresses but they can't be spent from. ouch.

[28-Nov-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
addresses dont exist on the blockchain

[28-Nov-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it issue is if the rmd160 hash has leading base58 nulls and they are suppressed, it ends up being a different hash value that is encoded in the address

[28-Nov-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
all address checksums are validated in the bitcoin code that sends to addresses (that I have seen)

[28-Nov-18 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
that wiki may be quite old and wrong, i believe James and yes, addresses don't exist on the blockchain. Still learning that lesson....

[28-Nov-18 10:59 PM] dukeleto#7326

Thing I learned today: Sapling addresses are actually bech32 format, not base58, which made me realize how to make the last failing tests pass üòÉ

[29-Nov-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
in practice, this means that Sapling zaddrs contain only a-z0-9 chars, while taddrs also contain uppercase (except for O, I), and don't include "l" or zero

[29-Nov-18 08:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's invalid for them to have mixed case

[29-Nov-18 05:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Managed to get the new version of sending working with the db. It made me fix some things I couldn t see before. Am at the point the sending goes and I only need to make db moves to reflect the sending.

The status codes for sending part have been implemented more precisely and will be explained in an updated flowchart

[29-Nov-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will manage to rewrite the eth and Z part this evening. Fortunately the T one is one of the most complex as it contatenate txes dynamically

[29-Nov-18 05:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
I believe my address-validator does 90% or more of what you need it to do, i can add specific coins pretty easily

[29-Nov-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am going to work on some other pressing concerns, let me know what I can do to help us get things running in prod üòÉ

[30-Nov-18 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
latest news from here : I got it finally working for T and Z using the db, made a lot of swaps, still need to make sure every specific Z case is handled but as 100% passed it will be ok

[30-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
latest part it about eth stuff, I had to adapt it too, the only missing part is the rebranding of the eth specific part that handles the sending. As it will consist to change source of info it won't take long, so I'll be ready for the next... steps üòÑ

[30-Nov-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you can also test with sapling activated chain like RKT

[30-Nov-18 09:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
would test with verus act the same? (I have some VRSC)

@Deleted User can we do some kind of "soft launch" where we allow trusted people to do swaps? What needs to happen to get there?

[30-Nov-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
We will invite trusted people to test

[30-Nov-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
First wave will mostly be people from this chan some notary and some people we want to "help" I mean I have a few contacts with some kmd assetchain creators like people from pirate  to oot that know it is coming. 
I managed to contact a few of em 1 by 1 to give em some infos and ask em if we can include their icon on our front page.

[30-Nov-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
We ll want it to be very closed at start and when we ll have fixed some stuff and seen how it goes we ll manage to begin spreading the word and inviting more people but using each involved coin to gather testers

[30-Nov-18 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
(For interested people I think I ll make videos to show how internal stuff works.)

[30-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the date : I can only speak about my part : I began revamping Coinsservers code to get stuff rely on db calls instead of file handling. Every type of trade works : that means my next phase (in a few min) will be to clean everything. Fix latest db calls and start making more and more swaps.

When we ll have the confirmation on gui side we ll begin connecting everything and shaping the api (that may not be ready for first tests)

[30-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it should be done pretty fast : ok to test at the end of next week

[30-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw for an update about gui : I think most stuff has been done but I can t confirm it myself but so far it looked very good

i just verified my address-validator code is correct. XSG does not have sapling yet, sprout zaddrs only

[01-Dec-18 05:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sri can you clarify for me, is OOT going to stay on sprout zaddrs, and not upgrade to Sapling? I heard something about that

We dint see any value with this hard fork for our blockchain.

[01-Dec-18 05:04 PM] Sri#6686

that s also a reason for the app... get a listing on a CEX costs either a lot of money, or a lot of troubles hadling it

trying to get as much automated stuff as I can, the only problem I face now is I added a lot of coins, and didn t update the register part to get em working as soon as they re synced. Will fix this this evening and test a OOT/ RVN // OOT / XSG
