if that s the case, as the sourcecode will be public, it will allow even more improvement, and maybe another step and project will emerge

[01-Nov-18 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
all the experience gained running / operating it will definetly help shaping future releases / projects

[01-Nov-18 11:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
agreed

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the (very) long term goal is to make it completely p2p

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
exactly

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
for now it's great starting in this way

[01-Nov-18 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
the only problem with this is how to handle offers, but maybe we already have the solution in our hands and we don t see it

[01-Nov-18 11:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, I believe even if it s not the best and top tech, at least it will offer something that don't exist yet.

[01-Nov-18 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
dragging customers / investors may also drag devs and tech people, I m really happy to see designers join the journey.

[01-Nov-18 11:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
💯

[01-Nov-18 11:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
as it s opensource, I think I'll spend a few time afterwards to build a graphical howto, and have well designed graphics that explain the whole system. That could also be useful for marketing it

[01-Nov-18 11:14 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, this will be very useful

[01-Nov-18 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
pretty busy right now ^.^ but as the community has very good designers... I see very good things on marketing, it will help

[01-Nov-18 11:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
(and we also have very good ones, so that may not be a problem 😃 )

[01-Nov-18 11:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I have a simple heuristic that says a project is good when it's something I'd use myself

[01-Nov-18 11:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so far this has served me very well for 5 years

[01-Nov-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
😃

[01-Nov-18 11:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and Barterlly is definitely in the list

[01-Nov-18 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
project like this were originally a need ^^

[01-Nov-18 11:17 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

Will have very light official working time next week. Will also negociate to work max 2 days (with one of those 2 being done remotely) up to 31 dec.

[02-Nov-18 12:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
@adstrakt maybe there will be some minor change as the privacy option, opting for a Z tx instead of a T one on compatible chains will require 2 checkboxes instead of one, instead of "I want it private", I believe each side should have : I want to pay in Z AND I want to be paid in Z checkboxes.

For the behaviour, the :"I want to pay in Z" will only be a checkbox that will activate a db flag to let scripts know they have to gen a Z, no ui work, just the checkbox.
the : "I want to be paid in Z" will have just a slight modification : src_deal must be checked accordingly, as the receiving address won't be a T anymore

Use dpowconfs ... so that all KMD trades are fast, then force or reccomend anything witout dpow takes 3x longer

[02-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[02-Nov-18 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol

[02-Nov-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Eth probably dones need that, but its tx fees are so high anyway its already at disadvantage

[02-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
tbh I will add more config possible, conf time will be part of it, but as james did something wonderful, I should use it ^^

[02-Nov-18 01:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its there and it works, just confirms > 1 is notarised... brilliant

[02-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[02-Nov-18 01:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lag also seems less than 10 on most coins for a while now 😄

[02-Nov-18 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s the reason I didn t refine this part yet, cause just also relying on this will make deals protected

[02-Nov-18 01:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
for compatible coins

[02-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
had a little weird stuff on my node, adapted lazynode in a rush to get KMDICE back and working, but as I make a lot of changes for the lite version on multiple servers, it s starting to be hard to keep everything uniform

[02-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
as that s one of my next project... I'll definetly have to rewrite lazynode too to get a very clean version for stats and node info gathering.

[02-Nov-18 01:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
(this would also  be useful for jawarrr as I ll just deliver this lite version for lazy node management :D)

[02-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
hopefully bringing your on the edge wallet stuff 😄

[02-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, too bad there was no testnet, for me to try that out 😦 Guess I will just work on porting all staked automation to KMD notary for next years elections 😄

[02-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
would make automated maintenance far more easier to handle

[02-Nov-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have the tx detection working

[02-Nov-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just a matter of instructing the wallet DB what to do.

[02-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
didn t actually think about the cleaning routine, I believe it should be integrated to the whole system to add automated maintenance time and auto disabling swaps for coins on maintenance

[02-Nov-18 02:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
already implemented at each single setp : heartbeet : alive : let s go

[02-Nov-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We dont need to clean the walllet if its not counting pointless bloat in the first place 😄

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
I will need to clean it if I reach 1K trades a day 😄

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For notary, we need, a list of utxos

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing else

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
different issue here

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once selected

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
remove them from list

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
man

[02-Nov-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
just thought of another crazy way

[02-Nov-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think for this thing of yours the load/unload wallet RPC's would be the best.

[02-Nov-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[02-Nov-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
hell yeah

[02-Nov-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
would make it so easy

[02-Nov-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once address used trade complete ... unload wallet

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
initialise new

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
exactly

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
safter for users too ...

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
prove somehow they are destroyed after notariation on each side happened

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
but risky

[02-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
if triggered directly after the trade

[02-Nov-18 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
as the priv will disappear

[02-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
some delay likely would be needed yes ...

[02-Nov-18 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
not a problem with my db design btw

[02-Nov-18 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
found a way to have a backup even if coinserver crashes

[02-Nov-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice

[02-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, but it has its drawbacks, this is the main reason noone should be able to query directly the database at all

[02-Nov-18 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
every single query should be transmitted via the API : only valid calls will be processed

[02-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
the db server is even more important than coinservers

[02-Nov-18 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I really hope attacks will flow... had a few pentest sessions few years ago, was amazing...

[02-Nov-18 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
took control of the managed switch, and just made classmates server disconnect... objective complete, you have every single protection... but you can't handle this XD. They took 5 minutes to figure out I cutted every single webserver, only mine was still alive.

[02-Nov-18 02:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s the only attack that passed XD, as we were all protected against ddoss and injection...

while I code the sending part... I just realised a little drawback of implementing fees, that will force me to rewrite most of sent commands, as I assume the amounts will be received as 1 single utxo, chaining deal / different fees will have to be done via sendmany or z_sendmany. Not a big deal, just a bit of time to spend on this.

[02-Nov-18 04:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
will just need to reverse things internally and it should be okay 😃

[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll have to make a few tests with different blockchains btw, like eth / game etc... to see if they all have sendmany (I just realised this part may be obvious, but not to me atm :D) if that s not the case I'll just handle it differently 😃

announcing, and having it live are 2 different thing 😄

[02-Nov-18 05:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw, little update, had to rethink most of the senddeal stuff. Have to create manually tx  via raw method. Everything should be okay, but I feel hurting a wall with CLI

[02-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
current setup uses too low amounts, so dust threshold is triggered... brain exploding as I only handle it via db, and no gui atm, so... I have to dig more

[02-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
once it s done... fees will work

[02-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw I could have chosen an easiest path... but would have been far less secure...

[02-Nov-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
I really want to be able to point out at the buffered address to send, and not allow any crosscommunication between keys... so it has to be all "manualraw"

[02-Nov-18 05:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
if in doubt always choose the most secure way

[02-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
yup

[02-Nov-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
think I found one blocking thing, testing

[02-Nov-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just continue generating OOT blocks with my tests 😄

[02-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
dust not a problem anymore, but I need to figure out a last thing... seems if there is even a minimal delta bw the rawtx and the utxo it s just ignored

[02-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
3 hours nonstop creating raw tx, little break, or if I continue I will end up eating my balls @Deleted Usercafee style
