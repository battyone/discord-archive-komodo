and I believe as we ll handle it in the coming weeks very differently that the checksum part will even be invisible

[28-Nov-18 02:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
only the validity "boolean" is needed on GUI

[28-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
James solution about giving specific timestamp instead of block is cool, because it won't rely on any query

[28-Nov-18 02:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
as timestamp can be generated on js with no harm

[28-Nov-18 02:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
the only thing we ll need is some sort of data for integrated coins with activation timestamps

Little bit of spacing after my recent flood

[28-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
so, I decided last night to change how I handle sending, cause it currently requires some calls that are very slow, like executing a script on the coinserver to get status + executing remotely scripts that will generate every single bit of needed info to put the params in files to get it automatically processed independently by the coinserver

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
the limitation about this is pretty simple : 

Imagine we got a version very fast of the backend that runs, let s say we re on status 6 : All green, trade will happen,  On status 6 it will basically send the raw info to the specified and chosen coinserver to just give him the info about the TX we need to send

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Works for SRC -> status 7, and do the same for DST

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if sending the raw info for dst is ok : status 10 : begin sending

[28-Nov-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
BUT

[28-Nov-18 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is with this strategy, if we achieve to run scripts concurrently with minimal sleeptime... Things can get delayed, or a server / coin can crash

[28-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
that mean we would for example stay stuck on status 7 : src has been sent to the server that will process it, but dst failed.

[28-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
in that specific case, it s a problem

[28-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause the coinserver won t care about the specific status of the trade, it will only process what we give and feed him

[28-Nov-18 02:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I decided to replace the calls that create the files on Coinserver by a DB version

[28-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
it will basically have the same information

[28-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
but just with a minimal change of the query we can add requirements like : go if status=10

[28-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
and make sure both side are completed at same time

[28-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause it also could have broken things with current implementation

[28-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
we could call this an edge case... but it can happen :

[28-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
imagine a trade went good and only the DST raw sending fails

[28-Nov-18 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
we re stuck at status 7, infos are already sent to coinserver, and he will process the TX

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
but what if any user seeing there is downtime asks for a cancellation

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
1st user will have received his share

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
and other not, still on buffered address of opposite side

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
so a refund would just act as : One user got both funds

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously, that is not possible atm, already protected

[28-Nov-18 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Pinned a message.

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems I talk too much, messages refused üòÑ

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User understood about checksum, makes my life much easier üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
we want to be able to have a simple life on any aspect of the app

[28-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
and the most important side of grandmaness will definetly need to be on the UI

[28-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s why I don t think blocking users for this is a good idea

[28-Nov-18 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
so... after all this speech about optimizing and migrating to db

[28-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
every send call has been changed to use that db, and it s working

[28-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now I have to change every single base script that based itself on file, and just point out the db fields

[28-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
"just" üòÑ

[28-Nov-18 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
where is all the code for barterlly? private github repos?

[28-Nov-18 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
3 days ago it was mainly on my servers with splitted versions

[28-Nov-18 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wrapped everything changed all the vars and put everything on a clean private repo

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
what if your server is run over by a bus? üëº

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
so on any server just a git pull will be enough to start playing

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, good to hear

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
private repo working

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
it was really a pain

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause each type of coin was installed on diff servers

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
so every single call / link had to be changed

[28-Nov-18 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
bech32 addresses are even weirder than ETH addresses

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t know em

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
which coin uses it ?

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
segwit BTC addresses

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
lulz

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
hahaha

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
`bc1....`

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
variable length, various rules about valid lengths and other ETH-like checksumming

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
on my side this is transparent

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause after all, I ll generate basing myself on cli

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
but on GUI side

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
for input checks

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
it is indeed... a pain

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's still interesting code, and it's self-contained, so that is nice

[28-Nov-18 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought i knew about BTC addresses, but bech32 is a very different thing, i read the BIP last night

[28-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
thank you for dedicating time on this, really appreciated... And I don't know yet how I'll manage it, but I will make sure contributors will get rewarded for their work

[28-Nov-18 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
does anybody use multi-sig KMD addresses? do we want to consider multisig valid? I assumed yes

[28-Nov-18 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i need to get the multisig prefix for a few coins still

[28-Nov-18 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have it for btc/zec/hush, because i know it by ‚ù§ üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User it's nice to be part of a new project, is barterlly planned to be an actual incorporated business/etc ? or non-profit?

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i might have missed some details

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
it will have to be ran by a business

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, i really want Hush to be on Barterlly, we have no liquidity right now

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
you already are

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, I mean "working in production" üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
all our exchanges are down

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
so I would use the Barterlly service myself, for various coins

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, as soo as barterlly wil be in prod, Hush will be too ^^

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I really don t know how to estimate volumes

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause we ll have unlimited pairs

[28-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
but if each coins community try it

[28-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
and are happy with it

[28-Nov-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
it can bring volume to all KMD ecosystem chains

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think it has real promise as a business, it's a really useful service

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
there will be a huge work adding as many coin as possible, cause every coin added, in my process, is added to lazycoin and is handled on autopilot mode

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I revamped my NN scripts

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
to work with eth

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
LTC dash pivx vericoin zcash

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
is there a goal for when to launch with the "first set of supported coins" ?

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
about the schedule

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i have all those address formats supported except vericoin, because I wasn't sure if you meant Vertcoin üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
we plan to connect the GUI this week

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
and start beta next week if possible

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
wow!

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
BUT

[28-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just broke everything to have a better handled solution

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
so maximum pressure to be ready on thurday / friday eve

[28-Nov-18 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think next steps will be to shape the API
