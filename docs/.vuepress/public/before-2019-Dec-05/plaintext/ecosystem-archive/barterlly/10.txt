hi @barv

[30-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
just finished the rewriting of the addressgen part. It now will take information for each coin on different servers, this will be done via a params table that will know which user/host the command need to execute remotely the requests, for some this will be done via RPC(mostly eth)
This will allow to add any number of coin as it is now possible to spread them across multiple servers.

added encryption on mysqlDB too, even with access to DB, can't extract sensitive information

[30-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
next step is to rewrite the other parts, next will be the txsearch one, used in multiple status, so will have to be done to be able to query it via specific args

[30-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
as my main goal is to be able to run every single script concurrently on different status types of trades, I need to make sure nothing can overlap, new splitting (on latest document posted here) will allow this as every single query will be run on the same time.

[30-Oct-18 12:24 PM] Meyse#0952
nice work guys! whats the UI gonna look like?

[30-Oct-18 12:24 PM] barv#0867
Cool, thx @Deleted User for the heads up.

will continue posting updates and stuff done here

[30-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
so afterwards it will be a full backlog of what happened, and how it was done

[30-Oct-18 12:29 PM] barv#0867
Very good.  Scolling ack I see you expect a delay of 1 month on UX.  Maye @Meyse  can contribute on this

[30-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Meyse#0952
yes im available

[30-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Meyse#0952
just the exact workings of the system are still unclear to me

[30-Oct-18 12:34 PM] barv#0867
It would be cool if there can be a test version online with few  (two) coins

[30-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can already

[30-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
with my old interface

[30-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I stopped payment processor but I can resume when you want

[30-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
as I use the machine to dev atm, better testing 1 by one and shut down all the rest

[30-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
will order new ones today

[30-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
very little for the webserver, db, and even coins processor... only the coins servers will have to be quite strong, but now It can be configured to poll multiple servers, I think it can be very cost effective

[30-Oct-18 01:56 PM] adstrakt#8509
@KomodoWorld & @barv - if there are any guidelines for how you want the branding to be let me know. For the moment i have started working with colours that are related to the new Komodo brand.

I am running around like crazy preparing for winter right now, once it hits, I will have more time to hack on things. Oh, and also to think about coding while shoveling snow üòÉ

[30-Oct-18 05:56 PM] barv#0867
Cool @adstrakt. Most important is that you and @Meyse think of the UX. & customer journey /flow. and the right templates  Colours and branding  can best be made easy applicable, as you are probably do already.  That way we can decide on exact branding(s) later.

[30-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
My PoV on this is that we ll want the most neutral and intuitive ui as possible. Customization and templates if this is predicted, can be done afterwards

[30-Oct-18 07:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the flow @barv it s already partially done (check the document I posted few days ago)

[30-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
The main logic will be implemented on the PP server. Obviously the ui of all the differents possibilities to interact with the api will use this base as a standard one. That will allow easy integration of 3rd party apps

[30-Oct-18 07:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the first external app (webserver excluded) that will bridge on it will be the discord swapbot if @sclear still interested

[30-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Separating the ui logic from the PP one will make it possible to have a lot of possibilities for future development.

[30-Oct-18 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Mainly via api for security reasons, by default only the PP server will have the possibility to have a direct access to the db)

[30-Oct-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Everything else will rely on api to get stuff done

[30-Oct-18 11:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
about handling specific case, made minor changes to status, in case of an addy gen problem, depending on the side that didn't have its address generated, there will be a different status code : 

# BOTH EMPTY : 210
# SRC MISSING : 200
# DST MISSING : 205
# BOTH OK : 3

A specific script will then loop on  200 210 and 205 to check availability on a 5 min timeframe, as soon as the coin is back, it will try only the coin that is missing. if succeed : go to status 3 (BOTH OK) and back to the main path

[30-Oct-18 11:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
as coin servers will be automated, the cron timebase will have to be greater than the autocheck/relaunch to avoid unnecessary calls

[31-Oct-18 08:33 AM] adstrakt#8509
@barv & @KomodoWorld so end of today i will present the first drafts. From which we will have something to discuss and a starting point to move forward from. Maybe tomorrow we could meet up for an audio chat @Meyse and give me your feedback and ideas if it works for you. Otherwise let me know.

So we had a look with @Deleted User on the first draft design. Some things came up so i will solve them first before presenting to the channel.

[31-Oct-18 08:50 PM] adstrakt#8509
I'll place the link update first thing in the morning.

[31-Oct-18 08:50 PM] adstrakt#8509
Just better to get those things fixed first.

As the api won t be able to communicate with any coinserver, i ll make a little cronscript that will generate a json for the ui to be able to know if a coin is available for a swap or not.

[01-Nov-18 01:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
(For the ui or the swapbot it will be useful too)

[01-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Txsearch mostly rewritten, only eth stuff missing.

[01-Nov-18 02:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll try to have it done for tomorrow :)

[01-Nov-18 10:23 AM] adstrakt#8509
Hi everyone so here is the prototype so far. Still needs fixing on some things. There are also other screens/tabs missing such as history, help, public offer list. But I'm focusing now on the flow of the main swaps which are the core of the product.

[01-Nov-18 10:25 AM] adstrakt#8509
On the prototype you will be able to leave comments also click pointers you can find it on the bottom right menu

Logo is still vary basic idea, but i do kind of like it.

[01-Nov-18 10:27 AM] adstrakt#8509
Oh yeah forgot to say - you can click around the prototype - if you click anywhere you will see blue boxes where you can click through.

[01-Nov-18 10:28 AM] adstrakt#8509
For now two main tabs that are working  are Outgoing Swaps & Incoming Swaps. These will also have tooltips saying what they are.

[01-Nov-18 10:30 AM] adstrakt#8509
Hope you guys like it so far - my idea is that looks like an app in this box framework - the screens should animate with fade and pop effects. Also should be easy to convert to a mobile version without changing to many things. Looking forward to the feedback.

Searching tx now works for eth. Will add some security as parity is not yet handled via lazynode.

Hope i ll attack the sendingdeal part very soon ^^

[01-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
looked at how it could be done to support ERC tokens, found a way using etherscan API for example, registered there and created an API key, very easy to get the balance. My problem now is that the contract stuff need to be done and encoded on the data fieldof eth_sendtransaction, but I don't know how to do this yet. I think it will take a bit of time for me to be able to generate this field (which will mean supporting ERC tokens). Unfortunately, every info I gathered was focused on handling tokens via GUI, not much info for curl/cli.

[01-Nov-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
As this part may be time consuming, I will just skip it until I found a way to build the data field.

[01-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
that means ETH will be supported, and ERC will be too (theorically). Even if I don't dig into it right now I think it will require a DB change for the trade table : adding src_contract and dst_contract, which will allow querying any contract just by typing the contract address

[01-Nov-18 03:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
didn't discuss about it extensively with @adstrakt and @maxijb yet... to be continued üòÑ

[01-Nov-18 03:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
rewritten scripts will be reviewed / optimized after I ll have finished to rewrite the 2 remaining ones : senddeal.sh (when funds were received both side, this script just send each side their part), and cancelorder.sh (handling cancellation from any status, calls refund if needed)

[01-Nov-18 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000

Could I say that at the end of the Day,   this feels like a "personal" version of BarterDex?

[01-Nov-18 08:58 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
an automatic escrow for 1 to 1 trades... to me it feels both related and very different from BarterDex

[01-Nov-18 09:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
automated system for OTC

[01-Nov-18 09:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
is the elevator pitch, i think

[01-Nov-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
various things that make it easier/better than plain OTC

[01-Nov-18 09:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Deleted User I have question: how much of this is possible thanks to Komodo technology? i.e. I think it could it be done with existing tech but does Komodo tech plays an important part in developing it? Does it make a significant difference that we could say "powered by Komodo" ?  It's not clear to me how much is based on it

[01-Nov-18 09:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@KomodoWorld protected by KMD DPoW

[01-Nov-18 09:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
at first at least, we will support only dpow coins i think

[01-Nov-18 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
The scripts are not komodo specific, they are using any coin cli to make it possible. Coins like ETH, (I really hope I'll be able to integrate it) will also be integrated. In fact any coin having a CLI could theorically be integrated, without any scaling issue as they can sit on multiple servers.

The thing is : It will make every KMD AC easier to buy/trade, and will at the same time be useful to any trader that want to be recognized as trustworthy (A reputation system is planned).

With current "tech", we can't say it's KMD "powered", but if this project is successful and people like the concept maybe in the future there will be a possibility to use different method and get rid of infrastructure, or the project may also go on a totally different way and just develop an exchange feature

[01-Nov-18 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
any new KMD assetchain will be exchangeable natively on the platform, this point may also help motivate devs to choose to create assetchain on KMD, or migrate their existing token into a KMD AC.

[01-Nov-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously, Barterlly alone won't be the reason people would choose to use kmd tech instead of something else, but at least it will be a brand new tool that didn't exist before.
