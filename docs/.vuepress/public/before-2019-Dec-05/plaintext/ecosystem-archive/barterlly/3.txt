I realised the fix

[20-Oct-18 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
omg 😄

[20-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
test in progress 😃

[20-Oct-18 07:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
if the last trade is OK, I ll let the payment processor run, and you ll be able to test it now

[20-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[20-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
it works

[20-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
here I ll let the payment processor running for the next 3 hours or so

[20-Oct-18 07:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
here PLEASE do ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
as edge case can happen, just use KMDICE / ARRR / KMD low amounts

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Fwiw I didn’t reveal anything.  Just that you were awesome. 😜

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
CANCELLATION DOES NOT REFUND YET

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok I will after

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have to implement it

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
but if you respect amounts

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I finally sleep.   Dog got out. Ugh. Had to chase.

[20-Oct-18 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
you should be able to trade

[20-Oct-18 08:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
!kmdtip @Deleted User 0.777

[20-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
it works with Z and not Z

[20-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I ll add a solution for people wanting to Z tx on all chains

[20-Oct-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
but that will be another step

[20-Oct-18 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
@FishyGuts you can ask to 3 or 4 people if they want a pre alpha test

[20-Oct-18 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
just not more cause if people mess with funds or enter large amounts It will cause me to go on support mode

[20-Oct-18 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
as the logic states : nothing can be lost, as the buffer addresses are stored with their priv to allow emergency cases atm

[20-Oct-18 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
see ya ! I hope you'll enjoy it... and won't report that it s broken 😄

[20-Oct-18 08:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
I can do 1 trade now. Someone to buy/sell? I have arrr and kmd

[20-Oct-18 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I did all trades between myself. For more fun get a partner and team up trading :D

[20-Oct-18 10:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
rereding your messages, I think the I want to trade applies better on this case : you end up on jawarrr because you agreed on any otc on any forum, and you will give this amount to get whatever you require

[20-Oct-18 10:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
if there is an orderlist, it will be on a different part of the website

[20-Oct-18 10:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
All I have to add for this is a step : I want to put this offer on orderbook instead of private trade

{Reactions}
👌 

[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok, some news about cancellation of orders, 

Whatever the state of the trade, as long as the funds are not received on generated addresses, users can ask for a REFUND.

The logic is : 

Whoever asked for the cancel of order is handled, receiver, or sender, depending of the originator, the status move won t go by the same path : 

Status codes : 
//0 : new trade
//1 : sender confirmed the trade
//2 : receiver confirmed the trade
//3 : both confirmed, waiting for funding from both side
//4 : sender funding tx received
//5 : receiver funding tx received
//6 : both funding tx received
//7 : Swap done sender side
//8 : Swap done receiver side
//10 : Swap Complete !
//21 : Sender Cancelled
//22 : Receiver Cancelled
//25 : Sender cancelled, and both were refunded
//26 : Receiver cancelled, and both are refunded
//27 : Sender cancelled, sender refunded
//28 : Receiver cancelled, sender refunded
//29 : Sender cancelled, receiver refunded
//30 : Receiver cancelled, receiver refunded


Basically, when a trade is cancelled, the scripts will check during a finite amount of time that any other part didn t send in the meantime. If that's the case, the tx and amount received during the cancellation will be used to refund on a refund address (with specific dialog box when cancelling the trade). When this time is passed (maybe 2 days to begin), or whenever the side not refunded clicks as : it s ok, the trade isn t fetched anymore.

[21-Oct-18 02:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
The amount of refund will be correlated to the amount received, this will have multiple advantages : If a sender wants to send via multiple tx, that will be possible, the agreeing about the deal will only happen when amounts are matched. A security is done that will ONLY send the amount if it matches exactly the trade, in the case it isn t the case, it will stay stuck until one side or other cancels it and triggers the global refunding.

Another point about that part, is the cancelling of an order will launch a modal to give the refund address. Why this : just because it s too risky to base only on originator address, as it can be multiple if the amount is gathered via multiple txes, the other point is that in case of private addresses, we can't know the originator address, and in the global scheme, the user don't need to input his refund address.  This step being optional, it will prevent people from being lost

[21-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
this specific step will need to be tested, as only the base logic is done atm.

[21-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
will continue it and implement commands, if steps are handled fine, it will be pretty fast to add "real" commands

[21-Oct-18 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
5 am, gn here :p

[21-Oct-18 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
integration of cancelling order will be done tonight

[21-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
if I got enough tests or if I test it enough to consider it robust, I think we ll be able to open to more tester, or at least inviting more people to join the test

[21-Oct-18 10:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think when we reach that point I ll just put bounties for people trying to trade... maybe the only option to drag people 😒

[21-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
I can put up funds for a bunch of 7.77 lots of PIRATE for 0.001 KMD swaps

[21-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
😃

[21-Oct-18 11:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
take your time to rest a little @Deleted User the bounty is not going away

[21-Oct-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
yah, I know, but it s like a drug, my brain think about XXXXXX new functionalities, when my finger just added 1. XD

[21-Oct-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw, just resumed the payment processor without cancellation instructions

[21-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
2 swaps just done in 3 minutes 😄

[21-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
KMD // KMDICE and KMDICE // ARRR

[21-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
tbh I was really tired yesterday and didn t put it back online after modifying most stuff of txsearch, so just put it back and testing

[21-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I let everything running.

💯 

[21-Oct-18 11:44 AM] zatJUM#9924
Pointer when over the eye should be more explicit it's a link

[21-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can add a mouseover

[21-Oct-18 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah

[21-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
And cancellation will have a confirm box

[21-Oct-18 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Focusing on what happens behinds the gui atm. I ll try to find a designer for the web part

[22-Oct-18 01:46 PM] SHossain#0007

hello there 😄

[22-Oct-18 01:50 PM] jorian#4555

[22-Oct-18 01:50 PM] jorian#4555
hi!

[22-Oct-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
www.jawarrr.com

[22-Oct-18 01:50 PM] jorian#4555
yes i have been exploring

[22-Oct-18 01:51 PM] jorian#4555
this is basically what BLOCKDX is doing with CLTV

[22-Oct-18 01:51 PM] jorian#4555
but now with 2 willing parties

[22-Oct-18 01:51 PM] jorian#4555
basically

[22-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
first purpose is to be able to swap securely for private trades

[22-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
2nd will be to be able to play KMDICE

[22-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
3rd will be to have a sort of public orderbook

[22-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
will save time and reduce WTS announce flood ^^

[22-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
pushing latest UI changes right now

[22-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
changes done

[22-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
people told me it was not intuitive enough, so I put a lot of checks to be sure the users goes the right path

[22-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
will rewrite the table part

[22-Oct-18 01:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause it will be a problem for small devices

[22-Oct-18 02:12 PM] zatJUM#9924
url jawarrr.com (without "www.") shows directory content (v1/ and v2/). Should redirect to www sub-domain!

[22-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[22-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know this

[22-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
damn internet, had to switch to second line 😄

[22-Oct-18 02:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
so, yeah, redirects are not the best atm, but as it is only the dev and test server it will be done on the real one

[22-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
and on https:// only

[22-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
listened to your suggestions, rebranded the whole path to submit a trade

[22-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
will add tooltips tonight

[22-Oct-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am trying to read backlog, thanks for having me

[22-Oct-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
I like to solve performance issues and design scalable APIs, let me know what I can help with

[22-Oct-18 03:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
read all of backlog 😃

[22-Oct-18 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
the website graphics are cool! Very important

[22-Oct-18 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I uploafed latest changes. Obviously it will be refined even more

[22-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll focus on trade cancelling tonight and tomorrow

[22-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
When it s done we ll be able to enroll more testers

[22-Oct-18 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basic trading works with the 3 ac implemented atm

[22-Oct-18 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
But as server is just a 4g 2 core and 8g ram i need to polish every edge case before opening it to public

[22-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jorian#4555
maybe for the future, you can start asking fees

[22-Oct-18 04:22 PM] jorian#4555
most OTC's have fees too, so people don't really care

[22-Oct-18 04:23 PM] jorian#4555
OTC trades tend to be significant, so 1% or even 0.1% can be a lot

[22-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I need a working and tested and approved poc before thinking about that.

[22-Oct-18 05:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like I said earlier or maybe on pirate chan, I believe that the first step for adoption is to have something reliable and trusted. As external coins will likely be integrated like zec btc or even eth, the goal is to attract users to kmd ecosystem and give a solution for easy and secure private trades

[22-Oct-18 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
In my case for example I mine eth and some other coins. That is a pain to swap... so basically here the goal is to say : whatever coin you have you don t have anything to do else than just send and wait to have your part ^^

[22-Oct-18 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think i have most stuff done for private trades. The orderbook gor example could replace the onboarding for PIRATE

[22-Oct-18 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
And no. I don t think charging assetchains is either viable or worth it. That is the advantage I want for asserchains creators to have

[22-Oct-18 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
External coins is another story.
