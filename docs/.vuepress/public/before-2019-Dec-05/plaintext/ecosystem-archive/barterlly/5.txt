mouseover should show a window that prompts you to give your addresses

[23-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
1st address is the one you want to receive coins

[23-Oct-18 03:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
2nd is the failsafe one, in case someone cancels

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
as we re on ARRR, you should input a T and a Z

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] jorian#4555
i see

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] jorian#4555
working on it

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] jorian#4555
need to start pirate daemon

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
you need 2 fresh addresses

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
basically for only T it will be easier

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I tried to put placeholders for people to enter the right address

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:05 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah if you want to see if that works ^^

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
or any address

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If this is going to require me to think, I need ☕  1st

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
but if existing one and you got flooded...

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
tell me when you entered em

[23-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
then when reclicking on the link when temp addresses are created you ll have the command line for sending

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[23-Oct-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
will need to have something stable before replacing the senddeal.sh with mm

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
😃

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] jorian#4555
btw, your command didn't work directly

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
it can t

[23-Oct-18 03:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, I see
Basically like automated escrow?

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause I dont  know your address

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jorian#4555
i copy pasted it, but i had to remove slashes and make single quotes around the array

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
no more scams

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] jorian#4555
but i guess that is OS-specific?

[23-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
thing is just in case of ARRR, as I can t know your originator address, you have to do it manually

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
for KMD and AC as the sending don't require originator addy, the command is just a komodo-cli sendtoaddress

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jorian#4555
operation succesful

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
nice

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
we should see the tx in a few secs

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
and pass step 6

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jorian#4555
movement

[23-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
when the status goes to success

[23-Oct-18 03:15 PM] jorian#4555
so i pay the txfee

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
we both

[23-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jorian#4555
i see

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jorian#4555
can't you set txfee yourself and make the amount to deposit include txfee?

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jorian#4555
just an idea

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jorian#4555
but anyways, great stuff!

[23-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jorian#4555
i think the process is fine, just needs to be explained

[23-Oct-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it tx fee is included in the calc, then it will end up being wallet specific
