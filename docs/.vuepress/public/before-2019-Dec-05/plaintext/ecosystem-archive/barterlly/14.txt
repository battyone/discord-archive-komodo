so you basically import only your vouts ?

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's awesome ^^

[09-Nov-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1) scan the wallet for transactions where all the vouts that are yours are spent
2) scan the wallet for all transactions to the CRYPTO address (notarisations) 
3) cross check all notarisations to transactions that are totally spent
4) remove all notarisations that came from the totally spent transations
5) remove the totally spent transactions, and the previous vout

[09-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
getting rid of wallet.dat is the main objective

[09-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
ensuring having any vout recorded on alternate db would be extermely nice

[09-Nov-18 01:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think in the end, we should just move to use addressindex etc ... like james did with CC contracts

[09-Nov-18 01:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but there then needs a new way to stor privte keys as using just the -pubkey is very limiting

[09-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, signing is the limiting thing

[09-Nov-18 01:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think in the next coming monthes I'll begin playing with MM

[09-Nov-18 01:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
ultimate goal being to get rid of infrastructure, but I believe it is targeted at very different users

[09-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
cause here we only ask for a simple sending, that can be done from any wallet

[09-Nov-18 01:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
handling or accepting privs as input is a big red warning flag here

[09-Nov-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know we need it to have a fully decentralized platform, but I need to hammer through everything before starting any implementation

[09-Nov-18 01:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes ... redesigning the wallet is a MASIVE undertaking... I have been deep in its code, and its obvious why no body has done this yet.

[09-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's not because noone did it that it's impossible... But that s very very hard as it could end up doing weird stuff

[09-Nov-18 01:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ohh yeah ... its weird alright ...

[09-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I know you know that, if not you would't try so much things)

[09-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Very strange... I ran into situations, where i removed txs that came after anohter one ... and then the listunpent would say ther ewas extra utxo, but getbalance and sendtoaddress couldnt see them

[09-Nov-18 01:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
behaviour related to iguana ?

[09-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oh no .. the bitcoin wallet

[09-Nov-18 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the last week

[09-Nov-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana has all its own functions for wallet stuff... but most of them are unused

[09-Nov-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cna build txs and sign etc without the daemon wallet

[09-Nov-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems a good base to start from for a new implementation

[09-Nov-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the end, the wallet needs to be removed from the daemon alltogether

[09-Nov-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can cmpile it without the wallet ... then just use a 3rd party to build and store all tx information and just use daeomon to send raw tx

[09-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
marketmaker does implement a single address (per instance) wallet

[09-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will manage to have a very simple install process. Whatever server involved. Will integrate some sort of registering script that will populate db automatically.

Huge news here. Not directly related to barterlly... but will help : 
Just received the confirmation of HR about my planning until early january : reduced to max 2 days a week with 1 of the 2 days being done remotely. That will give me a lot more time than what I could expect. Obviously they didn t like it and hate the situation but they accepted.

And even if I m forced to go back to classic working time I warned em it will never be fulltime again.
I try to negociate instant needs : I needed time I got it ^^

[09-Nov-18 08:42 PM] adstrakt#8509
Talking about wallets - it would be great to integrate Ledger Nano login to Bartelley in the future or a login to KMD browser like plugin like Metamask . To make the swaps seamless, all within the app.

@Deleted User do you want to do an interview about the project?

[11-Nov-18 11:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have a few interested parties.

[11-Nov-18 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hi. Yeah why not. After the rushtime is over. (Will manage to have everything running  with basic automation next week, so that next steps will be refining running solution and launch test waves)

[11-Nov-18 12:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Let me know when.  DM me. üëç

[11-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000

I think the best is to have the interview when gui will be plugged to the servers.
That way we ll even be able to make a little demo and open testers slots

[13-Nov-18 03:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Found this in another discord today.

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
well it helps to think about structure

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
jumping into code always leads to redoing. but so does designing before you start coding üòõ

What s this about ?

[13-Nov-18 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cause that feels exactly what the bot dev will do but using our api

[13-Nov-18 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
He doesn t need to handle privs and such things

About progress... hard time here. Overcrowded by requests from everywhere lol. Managed ro get the registering of a new coinserver very easy : 4 commands to launch and the new server is ready to fire

[13-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Had to move some files to have something better structured. 

Did a test using the random server gen and... it worked :)

[13-Nov-18 12:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will do more tests on it. 3 days I haven t touched it : my prints loses me for 1 script out of 4 : will have to remove dummy echos lol

[13-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
But when the adding of coinserver will be validated I ll resume my work on the sending part : I just stopped after updating status when the raw is submitted to the serv but I want more info on userside so i ll just add some status like : raw sent waiting for sending. Sent : waiting for confirm. Sent and confirmed.

For the Z it will act the same but with more steps : raw sent waiting sending. Sent : get the opid. 
Loop until opid goes to succedd and extract the tx.

[13-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Those won t do much stuff but will allow users to track precisely their transactions.

[13-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
After it s done (estimate 2 3 hours to get it done) i ll handle cancellation. 

Objective is to have cancellation and detailled status done for wednesday eve / thursday. 
Will then begin drawing the global PP server automation scripts. But as everything is already handled via params and well distinct status codes it won t take long. 
The last step will be to do the same on coinservers, but here again as everything uses params the only point that can take a little bit of time will be the "round robin" stuff on Z servers. 
(I believe that sending every minute for any coin for t tx will be ok)

[13-Nov-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
and this is the very first part, has to plug with 3 other groups of status : next steps, each one handled separately

I ll need to do some sort of massive tx in the coming days and it will include ac and external coin. Do anyone of you know someone / a place where I could buy it all with kmd ?

[14-Nov-18 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hardest part is here handling sendings and db switches and status. Very very long to test cases 1 by 1 so I began to think about sending em 10 by 10 and gather results to improve logic

[14-Nov-18 05:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[15-Nov-18 03:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
reread the images you posted @FishyGuts , that guy definetly could get rid of CLI using our solution

[15-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok... little and huge update here....

Managed to get the logic working for send part and handling exceptions. Cancel was done pretty fast thanks to the x rewrites of other stuff to handle every single case... on serverside it all is contained in 4 scripts. And 4 on CoinServers.

Automatic mode worked with manual sending (launching script) on coinservers... so now it will just be to find the smartest way to scan through coins and launch sending...

This means I m nearly ready to be plugged to the gui. Few more tests but the main first rush is behind me.

Next objectives : finish a basic version of automation on coinservers and after it works refine both automation scripts.

Futures improvements will likely be bugfix and optims(for example as every Coinserver interoperate with PPserver via SSH, reducing the calls to the max and using a different method would speed up things even more. Had an idea about it that will coincide with external tools / value I want to be available : servercoin availability and such. Grouping calls will remove most of slow stuff.
I ll also have to rewrite every single part using latest things I discovered and learned.

[15-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Next steps and improvement will require setting up a lot of trades and test again and again. That will make the pressure go down cause most code is already written
