[16-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
automatic reporting of running coins done also

[16-Nov-18 04:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
it will change a bit the logic of serverchooser ensuring a user won't have risk to be redirected to a not running server

[16-Nov-18 05:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
adding a new layer for Z... as the answer for funds searching only returns txid, will have to add checking conf step on result of previous command

that feature @jl777c made about confirmations and rawconfirmation is so good... We won't have any fear about hacks with it... uses dpow as base üòÑ

[16-Nov-18 06:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
(will have to tweak it for testing purpose, cause it s already too long to wait until X confirms, can't wait 10 min per test

[16-Nov-18 06:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
but that will provide a KMD security embedded for compatible coins

[16-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
using the .confirmations and .rawconfirmations

[16-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
(maybe that's this type of stuff you wanted to be aware of @KomodoWorld )

[16-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll definetly use it for compatible dpowed coins, as the fallback for all others coins will be automatic... thanks to how it was coded

[16-Nov-18 06:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I'll re ask (maybe for the X time, to JL the exact path the 2 vars take, but I believe if I understood it good that not considering a TX is notarized until .confirmations goes >1 is the way to leverage dpow)

[16-Nov-18 06:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
all dpowed coins will then have a minconf to 2 : Dpow is in charge, for other coins, it will be higher

[16-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
(maybe then on explorers it would be useful to have next to the confirmationbox another field : Dpowed true/false

[16-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
it seems the current code either use rawconfirmations, or just isn't aware of it

[16-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
bad luck here... using mainly OOT to test stuff... lag >14

[16-Nov-18 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
but in the meantime.... that will mean we won't risk anything in case of an attack / fork

[16-Nov-18 06:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems blocks are not so regular for OOT... I'll txblast it a few minutes to get the dpow to activate

testing a last time a full trade including z, checking serverchooser logic... and every single other script, now based on direct availability of servers / coins and using confirmations

[16-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c the change / switch from confirmation to stay stuck at 1 and getting back raw value happens the block after dpow is done ?

[16-Nov-18 07:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
(talking about .confirmations versus .rawconfirmations)

[16-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Nov-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
but correct me if am wrong, that will mean the basecoin will stay stuck at 1 as long as it s not dpowed : for KMD : 1 until BTC nota happens
Assetchains : 1 until KMD nota happens

[16-Nov-18 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
right

ok, everything works... üòÉ

[16-Nov-18 08:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
took a bit much of time using confs... but it s all ok now

[16-Nov-18 08:21 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, it takes a bit of time, but at the same time they are secured with dPoW

[16-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes

[16-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s a very huge advantage

[16-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
not using a const like 120 conf to make the swap happen

[16-Nov-18 08:24 PM] SHossain#0007
for sure dPoW conf is faster than standard 120 confs

btw.... about the progress, as I just DM'ed adstrakt and maxjib, I think I'll definetly be ready to be plugged to the GUI next week.

My next move will to write the automation part on CoinServer, then I'll have two options : 

Refine the code, and the debug printouts
Continue adding ETH (It works for addrgen and searching TX), the sending part is not done yet.

[16-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
ETH sending is not a big deal, it seems (but everything that was not intended to be a big deal ended using a lot of time with every checks added), the ERC on the other side, will require some web3 instructions, and maybe js coding. I think that's the part that will be delayed a little bit, as main objective is to have everything working to launch testphases

[16-Nov-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
but the thing is... as the global logic seems running without any issue for now (the most complicated stuff is handling Z and loadbalancing across servers), it's just adding commands to empty shells already predicted

[17-Nov-18 11:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
PLayed a bit with automation on Coinserver... and just tried a trade... With fullauto mode... It worked \o/

Will post updates tonight. Been running all day. 
Tried a "massive" swap yesterday. Made me fix stuff and didn t finish yet. Very very long to handle 10 trades and 40  addresses at same time just using database but it allowed me to see and isolate unpredicted behaviour

I think I'll cry, but far less than yesterday üòÑ

[20-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok, fullauto done. Managed to clean a bit more scripts for logs, and change some stuff to get rid of local files, on 8 trades... 8 trades went to the creation of raw, Z or T, on different servers. Only 1 transaction was rejected, BTC, because they deprecated the signrawtransaction, I ll have to adapt to latest signrawtransactionwithwallet... but np.

As automation and scripts improve, I'll continue testing sends, but will wait for gui for multiple and large scale ones, cause setting this up via db only is a pita

[20-Nov-18 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
but when I'll have btc specific (wtf why do they remove so much calls) call ready, I'll resume eth integration and begin working with GUI devs for connecting everything

[20-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok, changed the instruction for BTC... but : 

error message:
dust (code 64)

seems I'll need to make more expensive trades :p

[20-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant you just use an older BTC version with signrawtranscation ?

[20-Nov-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats what I would do... lol

[20-Nov-18 07:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I could yeah but it seems here that s just a command change

Micro update here. Started to have some stuff working yesterday using web3.py. but for an unknown reason the console broke and can t call web3 functions. Tried to debug / reinstall / change python version during all night. Seems I really did too much tests of different python version and have either to start on a fresh server or find a workaround.

[22-Nov-18 05:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Been smthg like 3 days without much sleep. This console issue is really terrible cause I really made progress... but all stopped cause of the console not working anymore

[22-Nov-18 05:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tried to ask to some french devs. Seems even an advice costs 2k so I won t rely on french dev community anymore

[22-Nov-18 05:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tbh am really angry to see that I could do anything I needed and was stopped by the console

[22-Nov-18 05:35 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
dwy, how much traffic do you think it can support? Does it scale linearly by adding more resources if needed?

[22-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
As you can pop as much servers as you want and distribute the only bottleneck is the PP server

[22-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think once i ll have optimized the communications and call bw servers we won t be limited at all

[22-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Honestly I don t know what choices to take now about current issue. I know using a brand new serv would make the env clean... but that would also mean I d need to reinstall the nodz where I got biggest chains synced

[22-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
So 1 day loss in fullsync

[22-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
The js implementation would jjst work but the problem with it is am not comfortable at all scripting in js compared to bash / python

[22-Nov-18 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Some sort of cheating workaround would imply installing a dummy node and just continue on scripts using parity remotely...

[22-Nov-18 05:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that would just be cheating without finding why the env got pwned after an update of web3 package

[22-Nov-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I was too brutal with the server. I think it s the first time I try so much stuff that it even break basic system

[22-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Emergency procedures and maybe emergency brain activated lol. Figured out a fix for python console keeping the same server. But as I went far too hard on the system part I think it will require me to reinstall fully this node before the testphases. It s the best solution I could manage to do without losing more time on system part.

[22-Nov-18 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
At least it will allow me to implement eth stuff if that damn console stays alive

[22-Nov-18 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Incredible to see how packages there are built. Default installs wrong version and can t even launch... and each step fixing a part breaks another one

[22-Nov-18 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then you fix dependencies... but after that you end  up looping on the console crash...

[22-Nov-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, with fresh console I was able to remove rpc calls frome one node to another... rewrote generating / searching tx with parity / web3.py

[22-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
works for testnet so... mainnet will just need a change in db... before attacking send part, I'll have a little conversation with parity's daemon on my node, and will check I still can getbalance with contract address as var.

If that works, it will require some sort of db "switch" I mean, it will be handled like the rest of eth and other stuff, but will rely on parity as central point for gathering data

[22-Nov-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000

[22-Nov-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw, about the tech part, all this stuff made me focus on building a working solution, but I didn't focus on maintenance (I mean wallet size, every other stuff is built to be easily manageable, like distributed lazynode that can update X servers on 1 command line)

[22-Nov-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the wallets... after every single tests I ve done, they re still very low in size, so performance is not yet an issue

[22-Nov-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
comparing with the NN wallet, knowing exactly how much tx are done there, I think it won't be a very urgent task, at least it is very important, but even if there are more than 10000 tests on each chain, the wallets will remain under let s say 100 mb

[22-Nov-18 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
so that's something I'll handle after the main "building"

[22-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh, and also, I will use my already configured scripts to generate monitoring stuff : just like there http://notarystats.com/

[22-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
so we'll be able to check status of every server without requiring anything else than parsing jsons

[23-Nov-18 04:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok, managed to include eth and erc at the base of addrgen and searchtx scripts, that needed some db changes, but had a call with Maxijb about that, and we may use some more tables for different purposes : admin and / or storing information. We'll manage to keep conftable as place for confs only and separate infotype tables with less important information

[23-Nov-18 04:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
ERC balance checking passing var for contract to check works, tx checking too. Unfortunately, for ERC it requires using external explorers like etherscan or ethplorer.io. This is indeed a limitation, but as I believe it is possible to extract the needed data via the parity node (but I ll need more experience on it), that will be something that will have to be done afterwards.

At first, I don't expect it to be a bottleneck, but in case of lots of trades, the api limitations will be an issue, and we won't have the choice but to develop our own solution to extract data from our servers
