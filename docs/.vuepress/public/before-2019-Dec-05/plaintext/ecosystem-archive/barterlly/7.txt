Mix of jawa and ARRR ^^

[23-Oct-18 04:28 PM] adstrakt#8509
Dont know about jawa

[23-Oct-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Are you available for audio session ? English is not my native language but I think you can understand me :D

[23-Oct-18 04:29 PM] adstrakt#8509
yeah i can do that.

[23-Oct-18 04:30 PM] adstrakt#8509
will be faster to get an overall idea for sure.

[24-Oct-18 09:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
We didn t discuss about api with @adstrakt yesterday. But it s definetly something that would transform a simple website to a gloval solution. Like integrating with chatbot

[24-Oct-18 09:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it should be built natively. As the process only relies on queries, imo that won t be a problem

[24-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Even if it s done aside via php. No more uglyness. But same behaviour

[24-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
As every single query is already done and the ui only basically take post/get inputs it shouldn t be a big deal

[24-Oct-18 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems there are tools built that make it very simple to have an api as there will be node.js involved. Pretty good news :)

[24-Oct-18 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll manage to have every single step for server stuff to run concurrently. That will make things theorically 5x faster

[24-Oct-18 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
And test a specific infrastructure setup for security purposes

[24-Oct-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User the 🐫 case thing made me wonder about something....
What's to stop someone from being `dwy.` on some other discord server, trading as `dwy` on jawarrr (using your previous trades as "see you can trust me"), ripping people off, and creating a "bad reputation" for `dwy`?

[24-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Nothing. That s the reason people can choose to change their name on each trade. And btw if someone impersonates me and sends nothing the other trader will just have to cancel to get a refund

[24-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
(That is the next big step : introduce the cancellation logic)

[24-Oct-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the other trader will just have to cancel to get a refund`
Well that's the part that I'm thinking of....
One could tell a confused person to "be sure to put my address in the 'return to' box" and if the unsuspecting person does so, then the bad guy get the refund

[24-Oct-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it already works as I want. But so many cases to test I didn t try all of em yet.

[24-Oct-18 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Was thinking perhaps a `Make sure these addresses are yours` kind of "alert"........?

[24-Oct-18 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Network issues here on the train

[24-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. That will be the main focus : dst / refund are what matters

[24-Oct-18 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that s why the ui is very important. Your idza is exactly the same as asking people to give you their credit card number ^^

{Reactions}

[24-Oct-18 11:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like I told to @adstrakt the purpose is to get something as easy as a game.

[24-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Intuitive may be the appropriate word

[24-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Btw the dest and refund address can be the same. It s just in case of different address format that it is needed to have both

[24-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just something I thought of last night when I was telling a buddy about people getting scammed with n00b using console and telling them to paste the results of `dumprivkey`

[24-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Does this really exist ? Lol

[24-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
less so now, but in the early days there were many that got screwed by having issues, going to random places for advice, and getting "help" from an attacker/"bad actor"

[24-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah :s. Btw I believe once it s ready it will need a marketing campain and video tutorials and howto

[24-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sweet

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now just need someone to do it 😛

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Tbh I even wanted to record a trade with current state to make people use actual version

[24-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Cause the need is already here

[24-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
And once the cancellation job is integrated and all others parallelized and infrastructure secure, it can be unleashed waiting for final version. But this can have drawbacks : present something in dev and unfinished even if it works can make people just say that ui is not very good and propagate the bad reputation. So...

[24-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the first versions should be used by insiders or testers first.

[24-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
The trick is that handling username instead of addresses forces the input of the address by each side.

[24-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
And it allows each side to trade without knowing the real address of the other side before the trade completes

[24-Oct-18 11:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
An option will be available for both sides that will allow em to use z or t on demand just with a checkbox

[24-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
As pirate is already supported it s just a boolean that will either generate a z address or a t address

[24-Oct-18 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
(Btw we will also need an embedded address checker)

[24-Oct-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
check is a solid idea 👍🏼  dunno why I didn't think of that

[24-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know decker have some scripts but as I didn t know what final language would be used I just put that part aside

[24-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
About coins integrated. I ll explore and test geth in the coming days to be able to mimic the actual path used for kmd and btc forks.

[24-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Total discovery here but as long as am able to check status of tx, get the balance, and send tx it should be okay.

[24-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wrapping everything on a memo. I ll put this as sticky and will report status for each "lego block" that will form the final app. This will also allow for more suggestions and ideas that were not anticipated yet.

[24-Oct-18 02:31 PM] adstrakt#8509
A question i ask myself is. If this would not work better with autogenerated names / address - so just as you load the page you are already assigned a name. Skips one step +  could solve people using duplicate names.

[24-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
That is possible also yeah. But the user must also be able to input the name of his choice. If it acts like : default : generated but still selectable / editable it s also good. 
What it will allow is just "trade user name" creation. As temp addresses are generated on the fly once both side agreed on a trade

[24-Oct-18 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cause people loading the page could also think : hmmmm what guarantees me that I got an unique address

[24-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Another path could be to directly generate it and have a type of choice on first screen : generate my trading pair ID, or use mine with an inputbox

[24-Oct-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
The same applies for the validation stuff : steps 1 2 3. We can change the behaviour to skip these steps

[24-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
The thing is they allow to be able to call the address gen right after we re sure both agreed on the trade

[24-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it can be changed to be launched just after the receiver gives his addresses

[24-Oct-18 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would remove 2 extra steps

[24-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
So the trade remains "unconfirmed" until the receiver gives his addresses. And on that state it also allows us to delete unanswered asks for trades older than x days/minutes

[24-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
You basically go from step 0 to 3

[24-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
(On current version)

[24-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
That is more user friendly as this logic will prevent one step on each side.

[24-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t know how you intend to build that part but it could also mean that only one side has to type anything. The other could just use a link with his generated username inside

[24-Oct-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or basically the creator of the trade fills every info like source amount / coin and  dest amount / coin and the receiver only have to check that it matches when he launches the page

[24-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
That would make the autogen very cool as no noone has to enter anything else than trade details and own addresses

[24-Oct-18 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The best way maybe is to just draw on paper a clean flowchart and brainstorm it here

[24-Oct-18 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
As long as we have a clear trade status, like state 3 : both have validated. Step 4 : address gen ok, step 5 : sender tx ok etc... it won t be a big change on queries and such

[24-Oct-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I figured out rethinking about parallelization that half steps are a problem. For example step 3 atm is when both agreed and addresses are not generated. So the scripts that will handle have to query unnecessary columns. Splitting into 2 clear steps would make the inside work more fluid and focused on specific steps instead of flood of if... if...

[24-Oct-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basically each step could be associated and launched in the same time than others. As there won t be overlapping in queries and scripts

[24-Oct-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I planned to add extra step when address are generated, that would let me run concurrent address gen and tx check without any possible glitch.

[24-Oct-18 03:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i, for some reason, like writing validation code. Which language do you want/need to validate addresses?

[24-Oct-18 03:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I assume you want to do a strict check for a type of address that is valid on the particular chain

[24-Oct-18 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i also like the idea that the website will give you are randomly generated name (I really like how Github gives you funny suggestions for a new repo)

[24-Oct-18 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you allow custom names, some people will choose very poor ones like BobCSmith1970 that give out too much metadata

[24-Oct-18 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the validation part should be done on js. The best answer will come from @adstrakt as he is the webdesigner that will handle the frontend.

[24-Oct-18 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
But what is simpler than a js to include in already built code ^^. Imagining it is called just using id or class means it can work everywhere independently

[24-Oct-18 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have address validation code in JS in hush-ng/TreasureChest codebases

[24-Oct-18 03:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Recent messages makes me feel that we really need a clear flow with identified and predictable status types. That would mean any day we want to switch to another method / language, changing a part won t break the whole tool

[24-Oct-18 03:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's too strict and needs to learn about Sapling addresses, I think, but it's something to use

[24-Oct-18 03:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
i also have some validation code in Perl which at least makes it easier to translate regexes to JS and know which sizes to check for/etc

[24-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why not. Tbh we didn t discuss such details yet with the webdesign team but this is one of mandatory "part" that we won t be able to skip

[24-Oct-18 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
what about an API endpoint which returns true/false for a valid address? the rest of the code just asks that endpoint

[24-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
My english is not very very good when it comes to talking (even typing makes me ashamed of myself sometimes)

[24-Oct-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
your english seems fine

[24-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s exactly what could solve the "problem"

[24-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
And that way of build means we can just adapt to any included coin

[24-Oct-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
my API would take an address and currency symbol and return true/valid if that address is valid on that chain

[24-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
That s amazing

[24-Oct-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
mainnet is assumed, but for testing we could also allow optional mainnet/testnet/etc parameter, networkID

[24-Oct-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, a valid t1... address is not valid on KMD mainnet
