btw OOT is THE AC I use from the beginning, cause very reliable and fast blocks

[01-Dec-18 05:37 PM] Sri#6686
Thanks to Komodo üòÉ

(about this fork I'll have to handle it separately, but as it will just be a repo / version change it won t be a problem, just have to consider it as an external coin

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Sri#6686
We will hardfork in Jan though

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
not "fork" just delay ^^

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah I believe that s a problem for most coins

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
the listing fees are just a beginning

[01-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
if most operations costs BTC... it s such lame

here maybe you got friends with a specific chain, KMD or not, if you got suggestions about what to add (excluding ERC20 as I ll handle this stuff after the launch of the beta), just tell me

[01-Dec-18 05:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
as long as they are BTC / zcash forks, it shouldn t be a problem

[01-Dec-18 05:41 PM] SHossain#0007

[01-Dec-18 05:41 PM] SHossain#0007
i see

[01-Dec-18 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
"coins dpowed by KMD will never have to pay anything to get listed, it's a package : work with KMD tech, you'll get a listing for a /kiss"

[01-Dec-18 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
we won t have much volume at start, but if I implement major coins

[01-Dec-18 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
we ll provide a place where all KMD related project will be able to trade for other coins

[01-Dec-18 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, obviously not as important as a CEX, or a company that raised millions from Binance... but at least this bridge will be here

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] jorian#4555
people are gonna be heavy on the internals. any place to check the source code?

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jorian nope, not yet

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] jorian#4555
and a high level/ conceptual overview?

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't own any, it's just a small zcash fork that doesn't get a lot of press.

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
abstracting and explaining the process is not an issue

[01-Dec-18 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
although VOT doesn't have dpow, maybe they would like to...

[01-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
about the code, as it s still unfinished, I keep it private for now

[01-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
@dukeleto if it s a coin you love and that have a good community... it s totally possible

[01-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
in fact @jorian the code will need to be reviewed for security reason

[01-Dec-18 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
but as the repo am on is basically a : git clone and here is the solution working, I think it's dangerous to release it public now

[01-Dec-18 05:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i wouldn't say love, i guess üòÉ Let me think more...

[01-Dec-18 05:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Sri the thing is, if your exchange has KMD or any other asset chain, they will need to upgrade that anyway, it's just a scam to charge. Some exchanges do it to Hush as well, but we haven't paid them anything. It's a tough call

[01-Dec-18 05:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
some exchanges want to charge for every asset chain + KMD to update, when it's just KMD repo they need to update. It's a total scam, *cough* digitalprice.io *cough*

[01-Dec-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
$500 per AC, for nothing

[01-Dec-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
to literally stop and restart the daemon

[01-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Sri#6686
Digital Price is still affordable Duke üòÉ think of 0.5 BTC

[01-Dec-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've dealt with this via BTCH a bit, and HUSH too

[01-Dec-18 05:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
they want to charge for every update, we said no thanks

[01-Dec-18 05:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
and they wont' update to DPoW unless we pay, so they run insecure old code

[01-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Sri#6686
They take weeks to reply to support email, let alone updating nodes

[01-Dec-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
the next Hush update will disconnect from old non-dpow insecure nodes, exchanges will need to deal with it. I don't support writing free open source code and being charged for every update

[01-Dec-18 05:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
It goes against my being. I would rather leave cryptocoins entirely before I do that

[01-Dec-18 05:56 PM] Sri#6686
Makes sense.

[01-Dec-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've been writing free software and open source for over 20 years. What CEXs do is highway robbery

[01-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Sri#6686
Crypto Ecosystem do not support open source. Every thing is pay for play üòÉ

[01-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Sri#6686
Be it exchanges, news portals

[01-Dec-18 05:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, the entire house of cards relies on open source. Open source malware is going to be big this coming year

[01-Dec-18 05:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, you don't have real devs to vet your source code? LOL, your p2p network is infected with open source malware, good luck

[01-Dec-18 05:58 PM] dukeleto#7326

[01-Dec-18 06:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
cryptocoins that don't appreciate what open source is and what it gives them, are eventually doomed. It just takes time

[01-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, but unfortunately, that s how things work

[01-Dec-18 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
people don t care about global goals and what opensource can offer

[01-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
they just see : it s free, I can profit ? let s take it

[01-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
not considering what it can lead up to...and not realizing doing such things just kill people that make their stuff work

[01-Dec-18 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Only kmd and ac are automatically on main user cause I trust the code

[01-Dec-18 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Any other coin is separated

[01-Dec-18 07:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
On future implementations I could even consider using containers

[01-Dec-18 07:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
But i ll need a little bit of time to be able to have it shaped with containers

[01-Dec-18 07:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
And tbh as our final objective is to get rid of infrastructure and use MM maybe it won t be necessary depending on progress made

Btw. A question about funds. And about pirate specifically. How will the upgrade go as addresses won t be the same and we don t have t available

[07-Dec-18 05:03 PM] SHossain#0007
there is `zmigrate` dapp which will migrate funds from zc addr to zs addr with one line of command

[07-Dec-18 05:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok. Sorry am so deep into this that I barely read news and stuff.
