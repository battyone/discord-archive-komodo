that s not the 1st goal, but it can and may help

[20-Oct-18 02:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
just added KMDICE

[20-Oct-18 02:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
am trying a full auto swap

[20-Oct-18 02:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
it works with KMDICE : check for auto with user : opop

[20-Oct-18 02:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll let it run overnight and maybe the whole weekend

[20-Oct-18 02:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you want to test

[20-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
won t code this week end but will refine my "strategy" to handle cancellation, of both Z and non Z assetchains, and handling multiple sent

[20-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I'll try to add all assetchains asap

[20-Oct-18 02:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
when it will be refined and strong enough to let people discover and try it, I'll then add external coins, focusing on a reliable way to handle it, but I definetly will

[20-Oct-18 02:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
(And btw if any of you have ideas about handling blank offers : like : I trade X $TICKER for Y $TICKER2, and make it public, so that anyone can take the deal, and make the swap happen)

[20-Oct-18 02:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
acting like a pseudo exchange, but that would let people actually bid with no need to have console/nav open

[20-Oct-18 02:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
(obviously the final infrastructure if it s used will split the server part and storing of keys)

[20-Oct-18 02:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
(I see this functionnality of : WTB directly open to public as valuable, but I may be mistaken)

[20-Oct-18 08:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can help test in a few hours. 😃

[20-Oct-18 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
found a bug in routine tx search, have 20 min to fix it 😄

[20-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, contained the bug to 1 specific case

[20-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
can t fix it now, or I ll get killd by wife

[20-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, should be easy to fix

[20-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
here stopped the global daemon, until this is fixed, it will remain stopped

[20-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
hopefully this night

[20-Oct-18 12:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
👌

[20-Oct-18 12:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I still don't understand what is going on, but it sounds good 😃

[20-Oct-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
like jaws meets pirates

[20-Oct-18 01:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Only on tatooine

[20-Oct-18 01:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So @Deleted User no testing today?

[20-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nope. I have to fix it. Hopefully tonight

[20-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ut when it s fixed you will probably be able to reveal it on pirate

[20-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
@KomodoWorld jawarrr is an otc gui for private secure trades

[20-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am thinking about adding exchanges functionalities later

[20-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Read above and you ll have the next steps

[20-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
^^

[20-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
@FishyGuts the edge case is that one sql query is malformed to checking the reczived funds goes false positive when reusing same user

[20-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
It s just a line to change but i can t skip family time^^

[20-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope i ll be able to fix it, go on private test for 1 day or 2 then open to more testers

[20-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
In a perfect world that would mean end of next week people will be able to start trafing on it

[20-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Trading

{Reactions}
💯 

[20-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll negociate 1h with my wife to fix it so you can test it tomorrow

[20-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
:p

[20-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
See you latet

[20-Oct-18 01:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand more or less, I'm curious how it can do trades securely without counterparty risk

[20-Oct-18 01:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
tommorrow not sure, but monday I should be available

[20-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
jawarr needs to be trusted

[20-Oct-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basically a central swapper

[20-Oct-18 01:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
even with this limitation I don't think there's anything else similar, could be a success

[20-Oct-18 02:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
The concept is : instead of going blink for private trade just use jawarrr as 3rd party to secure your trades

[20-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Each side had its own address generated

[20-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if something goes wrong user is able to cancel the trade and get refunded

[20-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
"You can trade any assetchain without  risk of being scammed"

[20-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the future it can also allow other coins like btc verus etc...

[20-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basically no listing fee

[20-Oct-18 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
And possible to give access to kmd support team if they want

[20-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Details about it are not fixed yet. I can either run it on my own or let 3rd party use it "officially"

[20-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
That would change the "business model" i don t intend to charge, just recover server costs. And tbh didn t think about it yet. First step is to have a reliable gui/backend

[20-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
@KomodoWorld see it as a type of changelly built for kmd ecosystem

[20-Oct-18 03:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
For private trades

[20-Oct-18 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Negociated this night : i ll work on it and make it available tomorrow for tests.

[20-Oct-18 05:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Am thinking about a totally different approach, much more smoother cause it would use parallelized routines instead of a global one.

[20-Oct-18 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Bt w I think I won t focus on cosmetic changes for now and just improve hidden stuff ^^

[20-Oct-18 05:55 PM] SHossain#0007
@0x03

[20-Oct-18 05:56 PM] 0x03#8822
took me 4 help offers to be included 🤣

[20-Oct-18 05:56 PM] 0x03#8822
i'm here to offer hosting and otherwise admin/unix related stuff

[20-Oct-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I was under NDA.  Haha

[20-Oct-18 05:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And us marketing guys already run our mouths too much.

[20-Oct-18 06:04 PM] 0x03#8822
thats why us tech dudes all love you so much 😉

[20-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Lol

[20-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
As you revealed it I just continued teasing

[20-Oct-18 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
@0x03 you have the history to understand what it is about

[20-Oct-18 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll fix stuff in a few min and it will hopefully be available for you guyz to test this eve

[20-Oct-18 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Feel free to drop every idea you have here. As it is handcrafted I can change / add features . Only a matter of time

[20-Oct-18 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Exchange mode won t be developped yet. Just otc part

[20-Oct-18 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Next step will be to integrate a kmdice game

[20-Oct-18 06:20 PM] SHossain#0007
@zatJUM

[20-Oct-18 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000

👍🏽 

[20-Oct-18 06:33 PM] SHossain#0007
no worries

[20-Oct-18 06:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok

[20-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems fixed

[20-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will make a few more trades

[20-Oct-18 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
and go on relax time with wife, I just need to be sure you can hamlmer it while we'll be watching tv:  😄

[20-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
1st trade done KMD // ARRR

[20-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
will test KMD / KMDICE then KMDICE / ARRR

[20-Oct-18 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
will also extend logging options during the test

[20-Oct-18 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User i guess adding an SSL to the URL would be great

[20-Oct-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[20-Oct-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
won t work on 80

[20-Oct-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
on production

[20-Oct-18 06:54 PM] SHossain#0007
letsencrypt is easy and free

[20-Oct-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have it auto on all my domains

[20-Oct-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
just want to have a secure and robust trade processor

[20-Oct-18 06:59 PM] zatJUM#9924
@Deleted User Suggestion: instead of "I want to Trade ", I would find more logical to have "I want to buy"

[20-Oct-18 06:59 PM] zatJUM#9924
and for the "With" field, it's not clear to me what to enter here

[20-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah

[20-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
that is ui part

[20-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
will be some tutorials and rebranding

[20-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
damn those blocktime confirm ><

[20-Oct-18 07:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
atm it doesn t handle crazy amounts not corresponding to the trade, I will just autocancel the trade in case the amounts don t match

[20-Oct-18 07:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
(after the cancellation logic has been implemented)

[20-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
before that I believe I should make every procedure as standalone and parallelized

[20-Oct-18 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
(or improve queries to have them lighning fast... don t know what is the best atm

[20-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
KMD/KMDICE works after the fix

[20-Oct-18 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
HAHAHAHAHAHA dat tard mistake
