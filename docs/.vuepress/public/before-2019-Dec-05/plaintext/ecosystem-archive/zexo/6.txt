no not yet still trying to work it out ... I know how I want to do it, but not sure its possible yet

I have dstm version that will fake shares from latest exploit

if you can figure out how to only allow it from one miner, that'd work

[13-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think my way sounds slimpler if I cant get it working will look to fake shares ... but that seems inaccurate and coul take too many or too less

[13-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just want a very small % left in the pool address for now ...

[13-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
you just set the hashrate to fake

[13-Nov-18 01:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181

make sure any payouts are not counting txfees inthe blockreward

this coin has a founders reward

is this the first of the founders type of contract?

[13-Nov-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the first chain that uses -ac_founders option

[13-Nov-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
which invokes the -ac_perc/-ac_pubkey

[13-Nov-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
combined with -ac_script, we can make chains that fund a CC contract from the blockreward

i see ,i am sorry

[13-Nov-18 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
since -ac_perc is arbitrary, and 13 doesnt divide into 20 precisely, there is a small extra

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  is ther anythig wrong with doing this to leave a pool fee in the pool address:
```
// get reward for newly generated blocks
 if (round.category === 'generate' || round.category === 'immature') {
          round.reward = coinsRound(parseFloat(generationTx.amount * 0.99 || generationTx.value * 0.99 ));
 }

`Was more focused on making sure the feature worked properly than documenting it` And you get how it's had to make something to go with it when there's nothing saying what *it* is, right?

@webworker01 
cant just do this and use daemon coinbase ?
```// get reward for newly generated blocks
 if (round.category === 'generate' || round.category === 'immature') {
          round.reward = coinsRound(parseFloat(generationTx.amount * 0.99 || generationTx.value * 0.99 ));
 }```

[13-Nov-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
obviously the 99% needs to be from config files

[13-Nov-18 02:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but if this works that should be easy

[13-Nov-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the chain is cc avtivated

[13-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all the txs  in the mempool on block receive are sent to a seperate mempool if they are not z tx's then added back to the real mempool

[13-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
make it thing the coinbase is 1% less

[13-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
leaving a fee in the pool address

[13-Nov-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when they are added back, if they are invalid that mesage will show up

[13-Nov-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats how we fixed dice forking

[13-Nov-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could send that balance to a rewards address by adding that address and the opposite amount to the sendmany

[13-Nov-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but float rounding might be a little tricky

[13-Nov-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its so very miuch more complicated

[13-Nov-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what if there is a ccvout in the coinbase
