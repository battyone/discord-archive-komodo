[13-Nov-18 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
is this project for real strarted few hours ago?

[13-Nov-18 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand the blockchain/mining started few hours ago

[13-Nov-18 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what if there is a ccvout in the coinbase`
Then you code for it, rather than using someone else's 9th generation pile of not-for-Komodo

[13-Nov-18 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but just asking if the planning and things were happening since how long?

@Machgielis

[13-Nov-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why code it twice when james already did that 🤣

[13-Nov-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You dont need to calcualte all that shit again... its alerady there

The development of the exchange has been underway for a very long time. We had no way of realising a hybrid DEX the way we visioned, until we saw CC. The centralised part will be ready ahead of schedule and is well under way. The DEX can still be built several ways. As we cater to traders and respect privacy, we will build this properly and the right way. The plan has been there for a long time  @grewalsatinder

[13-Nov-18 02:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Machgielis nice to hear back quick mate. Happy to see your project. 🙂

[13-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Machgielis#2406
A fair launch is a much better way of doing things in our minds. Going back to more grass roots. This raising 50 million to build something that costs a fraction of that is not how we want to operate. We would rather build based on what we have to work with and add more features as we go and we see the tech develop

[13-Nov-18 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I yet to read the whitepaper linked on website, the centralized part, would that require the devs or the project to have the license and stuff for trading?

[13-Nov-18 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just like EtherDelta got in trouble, could you get into trouble for such things?

[13-Nov-18 03:05 PM] Machgielis#2406
The idea is to have centralised support but you keep your keys. Thats the longer term. The initial will be very much centralised. We will ensure we do everything to comply with legislation but we are also working very hard to ensure we operate in the confines of protecting privacy. It may well be that we have both in operation side by side. So the end user may choose. But we take the right to privacy very seriously.

[13-Nov-18 03:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice
How will the holders of $ZEX tokens benefit?

```var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib-zcash');
var tx = bitcoin.Transaction.fromHex(rpcData.coinbasetxn.data,true);
var founderfee = JSON.stringify(tx.outs[1].value);
var founderfee2dec = (founderfee) / 100000000;
console.log(founderfee2dec);```
dam'd if that didn't take "days"

[13-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and what do you do if its payto script ?

[13-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and the value is difffrent on eveyr block

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and the value is difffrent on eveyr block` that's the entire reason for that

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean it changes on every block based on transactions that have been made

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
get val from template

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a ccvout

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool then needs to fetch tx

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to generate the value

[13-Nov-18 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if new x then write for x

[13-Nov-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok do things twice you still amke no sense

KISS

[13-Nov-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if the problem has already been solved dont solve it again

[13-Nov-18 03:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`ok do things twice you still amke no sense`
Then why dafuq are you not just using komodod and accepting what's there?

[13-Nov-18 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same same

[13-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue its easier to change komodod than it is to rewrite compled math in java script

[13-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and 99% of the code was aleady in the damon

[13-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it was commented out

[13-Nov-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
PR in a few mins so you can see

[13-Nov-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the point of having a BTC fork is so that we cna change it not use what CORE forces us too 😛

[13-Nov-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're right, I'm wrong, we should just continue to halfass everyone else's old broken scraps and never have anything new that's actually for our ecosystem

[13-Nov-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no idea how to rewrite an entire pool .. and I dont have time ... if james already wrote the code... just fucking use it ... dont write it again 🤷

I dont know what happened to that ... I started it... and miketout fixed my mistakes then I was told to leave it and it never happened 🤷

[13-Nov-18 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
guess I know how to do it now if its still needed/waneted lol

[13-Nov-18 03:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Last I remember miketout had implimented the algo in code. after that activation on N blockheight code was needed. I have no idea if that part is done or not.

as to amke it work I pass the coinbase tx fromt he daemon directly to the pool, and back again... bypassing the pool makig a coinabse and takign a fee... as to add cc vouts and othe special things in the coinbase, you ahev to code everythign twice in javascript ... .and its aleready there from the daemon getblocktemplate
