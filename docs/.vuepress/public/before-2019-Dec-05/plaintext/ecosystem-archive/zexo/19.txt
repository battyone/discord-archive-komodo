Thanks for supporting Ginasis Mining Pool!
Cruising at over 9Msol/s and block hits counting up nicely 😃

[19-Nov-18 12:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, you wouldn't want to encourage trading by doing something like trading

[19-Nov-18 01:05 AM] blubbi#0643
a sell order is only the half way of a trade 😉

[19-Nov-18 01:07 AM] Alright#0419
place a sell order at a reasonable price, and surely it will be filled

[19-Nov-18 01:16 AM] Don King#8901
Is ZEX using  BarterDEX in anyway?

[19-Nov-18 01:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It is if you place an offer there

[19-Nov-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419
I believe the plan is to use the gateways contract alongside the CEX

[19-Nov-18 01:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blubbi the alternative is that you could try for not making 336% the cost of mining....

[19-Nov-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
gateways contract is very similar concept to MGW from NXT days

[19-Nov-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
can find some good reading material on that if you're interested

[19-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Alright#0419
could be wrong about that tbh, that's just an assumption

[19-Nov-18 01:18 AM] Don King#8901
So will ZEX tx pay any fees to BarterDEX asset DEX,  like hyperdex will?

[19-Nov-18 01:20 AM] Don King#8901
Is ZEX using BarterDEX software under the hood?

[19-Nov-18 01:23 AM] Don King#8901
If ZEX is using CC gateway, then maybe BarterDEX isn't used at all, more like MGW 2.0 like @Alright suggested

[19-Nov-18 01:24 AM] blubbi#0643
@Don King  search for PDamiano#2406 in this channel he explained the project

[19-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Alright#0419
@blubbi I'm just curious what you expect to accomplish from posting OTC asks that are significantly higher than dp asks

[19-Nov-18 01:26 AM] Alright#0419
couple days of NH?

[19-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Alright#0419
pay ~1/3 of what you're asking

[19-Nov-18 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
porque no

its not if u try to get 100k right now```
3.3 days of mining, you can get ~100k for 0.00997481 KMD each

Hi. Quick update. We are getting the social media updated part by part, which is required for the new exchange listings. Please see the updated ANN which also now includes a peak (mock up) at the trading screen for the exchange. You will also notice we have been added to Blockfolio as of today, ahead of new exchange listings.

how long time?

[19-Nov-18 03:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It takes a bit if you are using native, use lite mode if it's available for quick use

[19-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Mr.Albert#4441
yes i using native,i waiting thx

[19-Nov-18 03:49 AM] Mr.Albert#4441
can i use CPU mining?solo in wallet or mining in pool

[19-Nov-18 03:54 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

stupid Sansumg nvem shorage ... orderd 2.1TB 970's from the only place shoing stock ... seems they dont acvtually ahve stock, havent tole me anyting no update... dont really want to go doing too much with the system until I have the drives, as copying the OS to anohter dive is a PITA ..

[19-Nov-18 04:34 AM] That_Guy8#4893
haha yeah know them feels got 4x Intel SSDs for rigs and 2 had to be RMAd -.-

[19-Nov-18 04:34 AM] That_Guy8#4893
luckily it was just HiveOS so so pretty lightweight for migrating

[19-Nov-18 04:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah .. was goign to raid 0 the nvmes ... got 16TB of WD reds  asell, so might just keep a system image on those once setup... or do a backuo every so often.

[19-Nov-18 04:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
experiance with samsung ssds have been realy good so far .. hoping they are fine .. 2Tb of SSD space should mean they lst almost forever... never use that much storage lol

[19-Nov-18 12:10 PM] That_Guy8#4893
How good has the price drop been for Samsung SSDs, like near $100 AUD drop for us

[19-Nov-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I went with nvme and 16TB of HDD space ...

[19-Nov-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt cheap.. but I doubt i'll be filling it any time soon

[19-Nov-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
getting 1600 MH/s on vega 64 on Verus Hash btw .. is that the fastest GPU out there on it ?

[19-Nov-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I went with 4 4s on a raid for 12 and havn't filled 1/3rd of it LOL

[19-Nov-18 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2 8TB reds here ... my 1TB drives are constantly dropping out ... they dont seem to make them liek they used to lol. Still got 120gb and 80gb drives from early 2000's that work fine.

[19-Nov-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
aren't "red" like the economy model? I haven't used wd in forever, so I forget

[19-Nov-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes .. sort of... they have the longest warrently though ... specifically for NAS ...

[19-Nov-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahh

[19-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
something ,ike 5 yrs warrently and 1 million hours expceted life

[19-Nov-18 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just hope thats not bullshit .. .as they are long term investment .. for storing everyhting for family, photos videos etc.

[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BarraCudas only get 2yr, but I've only ever had 1 HDD die catastrophically and that was one of the Quantum Fireballs when they 1st came out

[19-Nov-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if I'm lucky, using raid means I can just swap and junk anyway

[19-Nov-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah was thinking of RAID 5 but its not really a thing anymore ... with 8TB drives I guess just using RAID 1 will be fine and very safe.

[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've got archives going back 15 years 😛

[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not taking any more chances than I have to

[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
say I have files older than that I think ... mp3s from napster ... only because of sheer luck of never havig a drive fail, or been lost.
