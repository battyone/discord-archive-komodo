And setpubkey to stake to single address. Otherwise using pos64staker will automatically stake rewards into optimal addresses

The Zaddex exchange has been down for the past few days, and seems to be abandoned by the team? Status is pretty unclear.

[17-Nov-19 09:36 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
From Telegram: I  understand your concern, I am sorry that is happening, Redfox is in contact with de dev team that build zaddex which are the same that the one who build digital price back in the time. On our side we stop our involvement in day to day operation of the Centralized exchange long ago as we don‚Äôt see value and future for an xxxxxx other centralize exchange even with good markets and verticals. I know that Redfox been talking about giving part of zaddex to another partner-operator. On our side I think we have been more than clean and respectful of the community, offering a Zexo buy back and a real upgrade with DuneDex. That being said please don‚Äôt worry there was less than 2btc deposit and the dev team and Redfox has access to the exchange wallet (we don‚Äôt), I strongly believe that fund are safe and please know that worst case of worst case of worst case 2btc should not be much of a problem. I will still doing an AMA early next week. Thank you for remaining with us during this transition.
