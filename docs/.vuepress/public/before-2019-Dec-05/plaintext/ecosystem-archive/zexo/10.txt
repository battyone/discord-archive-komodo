[14-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which method?

[14-Nov-18 01:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Does it have a fee?

[14-Nov-18 01:31 AM] Decker#3767
ZEX have 1784 blocks right now ... but on https://pool.forkwitch.com/stats i see only 1288 ... may be it's not synced yet?

[14-Nov-18 01:32 AM] Decker#3767
Also, hashrate in ZEX is very high. About 12 MH/s now, i mined some blocks on my test pool with NH ... and leave this idea.

[14-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
@forkwitch seems your stratum's node isn't at the correct block height

[14-Nov-18 01:34 AM] Alright#0419
or stats page is lagging?

[14-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Decker#3767
Stats page on forkwitch pool seems ok ... kmdice displays correct height, but zex - don't.

[14-Nov-18 01:54 AM] Exile13#4458

@blackjok3r

[14-Nov-18 02:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Exile13 yes, if you control a KMD address, you can import that privkey into ZEX or any other KMD AC

[14-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Exile13#4458
zex is only cli right now?

[14-Nov-18 02:05 AM] Exile13#4458

if so, ill wait for agama üòÉ CLI is 2.wizard4.me

[14-Nov-18 02:09 AM] discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4Syh#1298
you can  generate KMD address right now and mine on it

Can we have another port for big diff on pool ?

[14-Nov-18 02:45 AM] That_Guy8#4893
is this correct for EWBF ```--algo 144_5 --server xxxxx --port xxxx --user xxxx --pass x```

[14-Nov-18 02:52 AM] OliverDay#5571
Is zex using the 144_5 algo?

[14-Nov-18 03:09 AM] OliverDay#5571
Is Zex using the 144_5 algo, or just normal equihash?

normal equihash

Thanks üëçüèª

[14-Nov-18 03:12 AM] OliverDay#5571
And we can just mine to a KMD address?

[14-Nov-18 03:15 AM] ted#5473
yes

[14-Nov-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Decker how did you do your pool? It seems forkwitch pool does not work am I still the only pool, I'd rather not have 100% or close to that of the hash rate... If someone else needs help doing a pool I can help them, it's really not hard.

[14-Nov-18 03:28 AM] Exile13#4458
anyone need graphics for ZEX? ive been helping fishy & the mates with ARRR
just lmk

[14-Nov-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@BL0ckchain  what do you mean, you need a higher diff port than 3031? Do you know exactly the numbers I need to set it too? Restarting the pool is not a good idea tbh and I'd rather not have to do that, but given exact settings I can add or change nh port at next restart

[14-Nov-18 04:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Machgielis 


Read Zaddex whitepaper. Have few questions:

1. Will your centralised exchange engine be open soruce code?
2. Since the team decided to be anonymouse, which I respect the decision, what points you have to build trust on your team?
3. How many team members there are in Zaddex project? Can you please share their usernames and their roles?
4. I assume you will use the Assets Crypto-Conditions Smart Contract for decentralised exchange part. Please confirm if that's correct.
5. Which developer will be improving Assets CC?
6. The whitepaper doesn't cover Z address useage with Hybrid Exchange. Please clear how it will use Z tx for DEX.
7. There is not really enough details in the whitepaper for Hybrid Exchange, other than much it clears that it will be a Centralised Exchange. When can you provide more technical details on your project?

I'll probably have more questions once I get answers of these above.

[14-Nov-18 04:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So far I don't have confidence on the project by reading the whitepaper and looking at the website and bitcointalk annoucement.

[14-Nov-18 04:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought of going to exchange and buying some ZEX, but after reading whitepaper, I felt it's dangerous decision to put money on ZEX.

[14-Nov-18 04:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will wait for the answers before thinking of doing anything with ZEX project.

[14-Nov-18 04:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Since the whitepaper mentions that team claims to have **"Collective"** 30 years around of experience with customer service, please give me something which makes me believe that it is actually these much years. Anonymous team + the experience years doesn't make sense.
Since the team decided to be anonymous, basically it starts with the no credibility on the past.
The only trust it can build is by providing the output, by giving the working project or showing the working code on the developer network, which I'm looking forward to.

[14-Nov-18 04:40 AM] Machgielis#2406
Really appreciate the questions and fully understand your view. The code will be open source code.  2. The team of devs are anon. We will be adding more devs as time goes on and we will offer community members the chance to fill those roles. We will build trust with increasing transaprency. 3. There are the anon devs and two business facing people. Myself and one other who will introduce themselves shortly. We are responsible for strategy, planning and also delivery. 4. Our core team is learning more about the CC smart contracts each and every day and will look for as much assistance as required. 5. Our devs will be doing this. 6. We already have the tech for this to occur in a centralised fashion and are now building this for DEX and will update with a more technical white paper soon. 7. Yes, as stated these will follow. As CC smart contracts are new, we are fortunate to have a number of alternatives and are just deciding the most practical way now, without sacrificing user experience and will include in the more technical whitepaper.

[14-Nov-18 04:42 AM] Machgielis#2406
Relating to the Customer Experience part one member has 15 years plus one has 12 years and one member with 4 years experience. Means we have more than 30 years in total.

[14-Nov-18 04:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Is your core developer here on this discord?
