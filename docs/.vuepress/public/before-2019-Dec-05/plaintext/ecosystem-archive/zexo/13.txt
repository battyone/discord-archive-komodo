ZEX is ZEX and KMD is KMD, they are different chains

[14-Nov-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you don't need KMD chain for any assetchain

[14-Nov-18 01:15 PM] ph03nix#3115
so you're cool with a 35% tax genie

[14-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it's not going to be easy I take it`
If typing 1 line into terminal is hard for you, then, yes it will be hard

[14-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ph03nix#3115
whatever

[14-Nov-18 01:16 PM] That_Guy8#4893
is there a media package for ZEX yet?

[14-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so you're cool with a 35% tax genie`
I'm cool with me making profits, why do I care if someone else profits too/more? I make my bank

[14-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Genie ... I have confirmed my pool is working with fee, but it eave the fee in the pool address, there are two options to "fix" this:
1) try to calculate the inverse of the amount perfactly down to the sat, and speiify the reward address in the sendmany to send the fee to the reward address
2) make a script that rus on blocknotify that grabs all tx sent from coinbase to the pool address and sends that to the reward address.

[14-Nov-18 01:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Do yo uthink the second is a problem, its faster an easier to make ... but I think would be more reliable too

[14-Nov-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r why do you persist on telling me about a "workaround" for something I don't care about? I'm 100% against adding more halfassed shit to znomp rather than doing it right for KomodoPlatform

[14-Nov-18 01:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok .. well as a pool operator I dont want to change the way thepool works unless pool operators will use it ...

[14-Nov-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I will try to make it work exactrly as the coinbase fee and take a reward address in the pool config file.

[14-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ph03nix#3115
:rum:

[14-Nov-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not even thinking about a single line of any znomp fork until I finish rewriting bicoinjs lib to actually work for the things wee need

[14-Nov-18 01:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I still dont understand why you want to waste your time writing soehting thats already has a working implementation thats simpler and less error prone .. but do what every you need lol.

[14-Nov-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I understand that you don't understand why I want komodo to have komodo things; no need to keep repeating that you don't understand why komodo should have komodo things...

[14-Nov-18 01:25 PM] ph03nix#3115
genie, why wouldn't you mine the most profitable coin and buy zex?

[14-Nov-18 01:25 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Yea, I checked the bitcointalk. Not enough info there for normal people to be able to get a wallet going. ttyl

[14-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
lol

[14-Nov-18 01:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but my way is making ithave komodo things .. .whatever the daemon calcualtes as a valid coinbase (which is has a reverse function usually in the checkblock that uses the same data and math ) is just used, rather than being calcualted a second time in javascript.... I dont see why you need to do it a second time when it exists in a perfect state that will always be accepted at conenct block as valid. 😕

[14-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pools payment processor is there to distribute coins the pool mines, why use the pool to do somethign it was never designed dor... use it for its job

[14-Nov-18 01:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and komodod for its job

[14-Nov-18 01:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@Potato Guy 9000 you can mine using your kmd address. And move the coins with next agama release if you wanted.

`my way is making ithave komodo things` Putting a Holden seat inside a Ford truck doesn't make the truck a Holden truck 🤦🏽

[14-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Just mine to a kmd address?

[14-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
@CryptoNinjaa

[14-Nov-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that isnt relavent... im going back to work this is pointless

[14-Nov-18 01:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@ph03nix mining is all about risk/reward most miners make the bank early thats how its always worked. At one point someone lughed at someone mining bitcoin.

[14-Nov-18 01:29 PM] ph03nix#3115
i know

[14-Nov-18 01:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeaj im doing exactly that myself @Potato Guy 9000

[14-Nov-18 01:29 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Sweet.

[14-Nov-18 01:30 PM] ph03nix#3115
i don't blame miners at all

[14-Nov-18 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that isnt relavent` @blackjok3r it's 100% relevant; you keep missing the point....
I don't care about patches and changes to ZCL products to pretend they are komodo products
`Putting a Holden seat inside a Ford truck doesn't make the truck a Holden truck`
Putting a Komodo format inside a ZCL pool doesn't make the pool a Komodo pool

[14-Nov-18 01:32 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Personally i like the idea behind zex so i have punted on it. I think this is better than taking millions of $ and handing out "tokens". This way they have to build something or the money drys up for them. No product no one will mine it. I like the model myself

[14-Nov-18 01:32 PM] ph03nix#3115
true

[14-Nov-18 01:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Just my imo of course

[14-Nov-18 01:34 PM] ph03nix#3115
true, no product no mine

[14-Nov-18 01:34 PM] ph03nix#3115
but there is the early distribution stage

[14-Nov-18 01:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah so they have to produce something or no body is going to carry on mining.

[14-Nov-18 01:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You mean bigger blocks early on?

[14-Nov-18 01:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Rewards

[14-Nov-18 01:36 PM] ph03nix#3115
and suckers get caught buying early

[14-Nov-18 01:36 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
as soon as there is a product tho the price should reflect that so the early miners get rewarded. if i have to hold for a year so be it.

[14-Nov-18 01:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Like the guy that recieved 10k btc forna pizza lol

[14-Nov-18 01:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Its being worked on i believe for the next release.

[14-Nov-18 01:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
U can use cli or just mine to a kmd addy if you want.

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] ph03nix#3115
i would like to be proved wrong

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] ph03nix#3115
founders fee is too high

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i hope im the one who can prove you wrong 😂

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Nothing wrong with being skeptical @ph03nix  👍

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i need the funds lmao

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
founders fee is needed for success of project bro. off to work for slave dollars

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
for me

[14-Nov-18 01:38 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

[14-Nov-18 01:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Just sometimes u have to jumo at an opportunity :)

[14-Nov-18 01:39 PM] ph03nix#3115
or not

[14-Nov-18 01:39 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
yea id rather a steady flow of funds for development over huge ico events and premines e.t.c

[14-Nov-18 01:40 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
@CryptoNinjaa not a clue how to do that cli stuff

[14-Nov-18 01:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Well im like $30 in on this punt so its vwry neglible lol

[14-Nov-18 01:41 PM] gt#2812

[14-Nov-18 01:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
1k zex for like $30 rig rental. 🤷‍♂️

[14-Nov-18 01:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i need to learn myself @stephenleeholmes118 ill be waiting to move my coins with next agama

[14-Nov-18 01:44 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
pretty much same as @CryptoNinjaa  i just spent a little more. still less than $100 so if i loose it its nothing im gonna get upset about. just like gambling. only spend what your willing to loose 😉

[14-Nov-18 01:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
😂

[14-Nov-18 01:44 PM] ph03nix#3115
wow great advice

[14-Nov-18 01:44 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257

[14-Nov-18 01:45 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257

🤦

[14-Nov-18 01:49 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
so what u mine then @ph03nix

[14-Nov-18 01:49 PM] ph03nix#3115
nothing

[14-Nov-18 01:50 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
so you more into pos then?

[14-Nov-18 01:51 PM] ph03nix#3115
no

[14-Nov-18 01:51 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
kk

[14-Nov-18 01:57 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
I just read above conversation. As a miner I never have a problem with projects keeping a dev fund or "founders fee". Especially for an exchange. The developers need money for the project to succeed. I need the developers to succeed so I make money. It's win win. Or lose lose.

Fek it indeed?

[14-Nov-18 02:01 PM] ph03nix#3115
founders can't loose

[14-Nov-18 02:01 PM] ph03nix#3115
might be wasting hash

[14-Nov-18 02:01 PM] ph03nix#3115
fek it

[14-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499
Might be wasting hash mining anything. Lol this is always the case.

[14-Nov-18 02:03 PM] ph03nix#3115
yeah ok

[14-Nov-18 02:03 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
might be but its a chance we willing to take. nobody forcing you to participate

[14-Nov-18 02:03 PM] ph03nix#3115
right

[14-Nov-18 02:10 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Hey all GinasisMining has opened its ZEX pool: http://zex.ginasismining.com/ 1% mining fee
Tested working thanks to @blackjok3r for the support

[14-Nov-18 02:10 PM] ph03nix#3115
word of caution to buyers, not to miners

[14-Nov-18 02:10 PM] That_Guy8#4893
would be great to even up that hashrate a bit over the pools 😃

[14-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
even for miners to use as a fal back or whatever they like. Both pools are exactly the same fee and software

[14-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I encourage to split over the two if you can  please .. I am moving to a local test chain, as spending $50 a taking 3H to get a block to test is just getting silly lol...
