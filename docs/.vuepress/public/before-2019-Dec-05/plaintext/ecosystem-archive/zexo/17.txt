will upload working pool without gencfg script for you right now

[16-Nov-18 07:04 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
ok

[16-Nov-18 07:05 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
let me know when you get it

[16-Nov-18 07:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the pool is broken` that can't be true, you just said 40 minutes ago `it works perfectly` :trollface:

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 the current ver on git I think is broken atm

[16-Nov-18 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just messing with him because he's him and I'm me 😛

[16-Nov-18 07:27 AM] That_Guy8#4893
haha

[16-Nov-18 07:28 AM] That_Guy8#4893
also WTB ability to server nickname myself? is that a thing that can happen?

[16-Nov-18 07:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you want a what?

[16-Nov-18 07:28 AM] That_Guy8#4893
to be able to edit my nickname on this discord

[16-Nov-18 07:29 AM] That_Guy8#4893
aka add "Ginasis Mining" if people need to tag me

[16-Nov-18 07:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
click the little ⚙ just to the left of where you type

[16-Nov-18 07:30 AM] That_Guy8#4893
yeah can change name completely, but servers can allow server side nicknames

[16-Nov-18 07:30 AM] That_Guy8#4893
aka in private discords ill still be That_Guy8 and on ones I set it will be That_Guy8 (Ginasis Mining) or whatever

[16-Nov-18 07:33 AM] That_Guy8#4893
With the right settings you can right click your name in the chat area and get the option "Change Nickname" and it only applies to the current server

[16-Nov-18 07:33 AM] That_Guy8#4893
who would need tagging to see if we can have this feature?

[16-Nov-18 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no clue, likely need to ask in a more open channel and not "3rd party"

@Laviathon -bcmonster.com  pool is now working

[16-Nov-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The reward recipients is also working...

[16-Nov-18 07:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can set any amount of address and percents, it can handle them. It adds the reward address to the sendmany with a for loop. Was quite simple to fix once I figured out how to code it in javascript lol.

[16-Nov-18 08:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont like it excatly, as it calcualtes things multiple times for no reason, but it works and is accurate enough that its paying out starting from a clean pool wallet with zero balance and keeps paying out. Will need to update ZEX pool soon, will increase NH mindiff too, 50 is too low.

[16-Nov-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also changed the gencfg.sh script, to take a $1 of a specific coin, and updated the coins.json template to use disablecb by  default, and also enabled payments by default in poolcongifs.template.

[16-Nov-18 08:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will update readme.md and then the pool is done. 😄

[16-Nov-18 08:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
until next time

its workig for me

[16-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just yuse the gencfg script

[16-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what exactly are you trying to do ?

[16-Nov-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe if not suign disablecb option its not working

[16-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
what was the last thing you said?

[16-Nov-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my pool uses a new mode of operation `disablecb`

[16-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this makes the pool directly just use the coinbase tx created by the daemon

[16-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the komodod MUST be FSM branch from jl777 repo

[16-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for the required RPC calls to be active to use it

[16-Nov-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also the node-stratum-pool fork assumes your using knomp

[16-Nov-18 08:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I doubt it would work with other nomps ... wihtout modification

[16-Nov-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Do you need a step by step guide to make a ZEX pool ?

[16-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
lol I dont think so... Not sure what is wrong.. lol

[16-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
http://pirate.bcmonster.com  http://kmd.bcmonster.com   I normaly dont have issues

[16-Nov-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a totally diffrent pool ... i tried to keep it backwards compatible

[16-Nov-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but maybe its not ...

[16-Nov-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have only tested it with disablecb enabled

[16-Nov-18 08:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least for payments processing ... not  using a pool fee it was working on disablecb == false

[16-Nov-18 08:25 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
I copied the coin config you put in earlier

[16-Nov-18 08:25 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462

"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",

"peerMagic": "50e39c62",
"disablecb": true
}

[16-Nov-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I guess I will need to make another fresh VPS nad try to make a ZEX pool to test it

[16-Nov-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fast running out of day here. I need to drive to city in a hour

[16-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The best way to do it properly is to use my exact Knomp and just run `./gencfg.sh ZEX`

[16-Nov-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will work

[16-Nov-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am runnign a test chain called TZEX with the exact same chain params as ZEX... and its working fine

[16-Nov-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok readme updated, and pool with pool fees is confirmed working here... Must use FSM branch for disablecb mode.

[16-Nov-18 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
still :smh:

[16-Nov-18 09:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
how's zex mining work?

[16-Nov-18 09:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
do you need z addy for it? or just normal?

[16-Nov-18 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
from a miner's end, it's the same as any other 200,9 coin

[16-Nov-18 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
R addy

[16-Nov-18 09:21 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok cool. port 3031 for a z9 right?

[16-Nov-18 09:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that I dunno, you'll have to look at the specific pool

[16-Nov-18 09:21 AM] mrlynch#5735
on stratum+tcp://45.77.56.175:3031

[16-Nov-18 09:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
there are only 2 pools right?

[16-Nov-18 09:22 AM] mrlynch#5735

chickenpool has opted to fix the issues in bicoinjs-lib to make it match the transactions of the daemon rather than reinvent the wheel with custom daemons and "patched" pay loops

[16-Nov-18 09:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
bicoinjs-lib ..... bicoinjs ..... js .... JS .. kudos to them

[16-Nov-18 09:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
not a fan of js

[16-Nov-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
then don't try to run a nomp pool 😛

[16-Nov-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the whole thing is js

[16-Nov-18 09:27 AM] mrlynch#5735
i was looking at running one for pirate and after i looked at knomp i decided to wait a bit lol

[16-Nov-18 01:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
Zex native works on macos as well with 44c

[16-Nov-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well @webworker01  I already solved that.. Do you want a PR ?

[16-Nov-18 02:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`i figured out how to make the coinbase with nomp without a fee, as soon as i add a fee into coinbase they are rejected`
@webworker01 are you adding fee before or after tax?

[16-Nov-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Why do you need to do that ... I still fully dont understand why you guys are set on creating the coinbase again, when a vild tx is already made by the daemon ?

[16-Nov-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its non sensical .. surely there is somehting else you can spend your time on

[16-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I guess I should stop worriing about your desicions... and just concentrate on what I'm supposed to be doing

[16-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Good luck with it

[16-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The issue is in the merkle root calculation btw

[16-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I had to change the daemon output

[16-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
simply passing the coinbase tx and txid fromt he daemon into the pools coinbase

[16-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never worked

[16-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it has to be send as a tx in the transactions array

[16-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe this is a clue for you?

[16-Nov-18 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok... I guess I need to launch staked ASAP with a CC vout in the coinbase .. .fgood luck using bitcoin-js to make that :trollface:

[16-Nov-18 02:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I still fully dont understand why you guys are set on creating the coinbase again`
Because your shit doesn't work with the real daemon....
if the feken guy that's spent the last 6 months working with the daemon would work on the feken bits that create the tx (bitcoinjs-lib) and leave the rest to us, this would be done and properly already and everyone would be satisfied
ffs

[16-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The change will be merged down soon...

[16-Nov-18 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It eeded to be tested like any change 😕

[16-Nov-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it didn't need to be feken changed!

🤣 

[16-Nov-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
changing the daemon because you're to lazy to properly fix some 3rd party shit is some BTC-Core level of silly

[16-Nov-18 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The issue is in the merkle root calculation btw`
What if the calculation in the lib matched the calculation in the daemon, instead of altering the daemon and changing the entire process back to 2009?

[16-Nov-18 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh wait, that'd feken make sense 🙄
