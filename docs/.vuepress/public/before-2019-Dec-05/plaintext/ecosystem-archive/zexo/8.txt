To sell one would either need to mine to a DP deposit address (frowned upon), or use CLI to send the mined coins directly. Until Agama GUI has ZEX. 
When Agama GUI Zex?  :trollface:

i guess ZEX requires a very new komodod? Is `dev` branch ok? I got this error on a `dev` build a week ago: ```$ ./komodod -ac_name=ZEX -ac_cc=2 -ac_founders=1 -ac_halving=525600 -ac_reward=13000000000 -ac_pubkey=039d4a50cc70d1184e462a22edb3b66385da97cc8059196f8305c184a3e21440af -addnode=5.9.102.210  &

[13-Nov-18 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
testing with latest dev branch now

[13-Nov-18 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
i didn't see core c++ changes in what I just pulled in, tho. This problem might persist. The above happened on OS X

[13-Nov-18 07:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes compile jl777 dev branch

@jansako I assume most people mining in this channel are able to work cli, and from my end I can just use agama and explorer to see zex funds

[13-Nov-18 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
there is an agama build, but it's a test build and is not recommended to use. Zex should be included in the next proper Agama release

when i type `komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=ZEX getinfo`
it says the longestchain is 0? what am I typing wrong?

[13-Nov-18 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it usually has to finish syncing for that to be correct

[13-Nov-18 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
are you still syncing?

[13-Nov-18 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
look at progress=... in debug.log

[13-Nov-18 07:47 PM] Llama#1330
it says "finished loading blocks ZEX"

[13-Nov-18 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hes probably on the wrong version

[13-Nov-18 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to just restart pool ... its ok .. will fix iteslf soon.. just added a console print didnt change anything

[13-Nov-18 07:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
oh and changed it so that 45 person, cant connect with invalid address .. they gave me too many free coins already

FYI: Until this AC has functioning DPoW notarizations (all NNs haven't upgraded yet), re-orgs will be possible. Be careful with large trades until dpow is fully working

[13-Nov-18 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
what does the number represent

[13-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the percentage

[13-Nov-18 07:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
duke .. unless somone is using my pool, they cant even mine it ... doint thing its an issue 😛

[13-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
53846154? How does this represent 35?

[13-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
1/x

[13-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
do the math

[13-Nov-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
look at the coinbase

[13-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
200/130 -> 1.538461538461538

[13-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so 35% of the BR is 70 and 200 - 130 = 70

[13-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
Ah understood, thanks

[13-Nov-18 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
