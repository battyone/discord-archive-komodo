I think we may have had a minor block issue for a day but I confirmed everything is back on track and working correctly as of last night.

[18-Jan-19 11:13 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Sorry life got the better of me and I was not watching as vigilant as I should have been! I will make sure to stay on top of it from now on!! 😃

[19-Jan-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@That_Guy8 my point was that since he used @ Pool-Operator, it tagged every pool op from every pool (even the pools that don't have ZEX)

[19-Jan-19 01:56 PM] 0x03#8822
i second that.

@SHossain tanx👍

[21-Mar-19 05:33 PM] zaddex#2546
to answer few questions:
Here are some communication about where we are at.
The PLAN:
Zaddex will have its license in Estonia to operate its crypto to crypto and it crypto to fiat
we will list valuable and meaningful crypto projects with a priority to the komodo ecosystem asset chains
the fiat gateway will include mostly e wallet, instant disbursement (canada/us/australia); classic international wire and domestic wire (ach and sepa)
Zaddex will start support in beta SME launch via Launchpad in West AFrica - official release count down by official <10days
About ZEX we are considering and finalizing the details of an hard fork
As of today here will be the parameters
Supply reduce from 210mio to 100mio
Wallet will have to be updated
Hard fork will likely happen in April
Time to release properly
PoS/PoW: 92.23% - 7.77%
Rewards: 7.77% per year (dicreasing year 2 mechanically)
and 20mio dedicated to business dev , legal and marketing
Burn of coins corresponding to 7.77% per month of profit
The 60mio supply (100-mined supply)
Will be use for dev (33%) and business dev and legal (66.66%)
As of today we would like to also support margin trading of KMD but not sure need to make sure that it regulatory possible to do so
Pending final signature OCU (OUR) is the parent company of Zaddex (50% equity)
And will handle the ZEX assets
We have been consider transactional mining to promote the listed assets nothing fix as of today
Idea 💡 and contributions will be more than welcome
Tip bots will be put in place for both OUR and ZEX in the coming days
Thanks for your attention
Cheers 🥂 and please stay tuned

@zaddex When exchange or fork?

[30-Apr-19 10:05 AM] SlowGrowth#2620
I guess they keep having problems in communication

[30-Apr-19 08:56 PM] cabera#9759
@jl777c  Do you have an update for the community?

[30-Apr-19 08:57 PM] jl777c#5810
about?

[30-Apr-19 09:04 PM] cabera#9759
@jl777c  about the Zaddex exchange go live date or the upcoming fork. Just read previous announcement that exchange was going live end of this month.

[30-Apr-19 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
how would I know?

[30-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
zaddex is not my project

[30-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i cannot possible know every detail about every ecosystem project

[30-Apr-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and I am certainly not centrally managing all of them

[30-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, I am not managing them at all, the ecosystem projects are independent projects

[30-Apr-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
independent

[30-Apr-19 09:08 PM] cabera#9759
@jl777c  sorry must been missinformed. I thought you were a part of Zaddex core team therefore the question.

Fabien was away for quite a while to work with Ivory Coast government. His extremely busy but gave a small update there 😃

[02-May-19 06:48 AM] cabera#9759
Yeah I saw the update @Crabby Paddy . I'm not suprised the licensing part is taking longer then expected for them when it comes to fiat  -> crypto. They should take help from me to speed things up when it comes to being compliant and applying the proper deposit/withdraw methods for the exchange 😃

[07-May-19 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Update wallet after probably

[07-May-19 09:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless new wallet already supports the fork

[08-May-19 12:37 PM] Dany_sof#4502
It's more mystery than information for hard fork 😂

[08-May-19 05:15 PM] Dany_sof#4502
there will be no fork that I do not see being official on the site

[09-May-19 01:02 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Dany_sof  🙄  fork to change pow/pos and total supply reduction. Also adding Cryptoconditions/smart contracts from what I know
