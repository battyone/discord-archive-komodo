you are using komodoplatform

[13-Nov-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
how many times do i say to use the CORRECT version or it is incorrect

well, that is the fourth build

`how many times do i say to use the CORRECT version or it is incorrect`
As many times as it takes for the 'jl777' repo to **not** say to clone the 'komodoplatform' repo?

[13-Nov-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:trollface:

[13-Nov-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont maintain the readme

[13-Nov-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it was written from the point of view of komodoplatform

[13-Nov-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are in the jl777 repo, why to change to komodoplatform repo?

[13-Nov-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you said to 😛

[13-Nov-18 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
we rarely question what you words (or seemingly yours) say

[13-Nov-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the readme has some sort of fancy formatting

[13-Nov-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
how could you imagine that was me?

[13-Nov-18 11:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If step 4 said `clone bitcoin repo` 50+% of people would

[13-Nov-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
diff is only 9x from when I started daemon, so not too too bad

nearly have the proper pool done .. its just too hot to run my miner in here ... need aircon for that it got to like 90C and just turned off after 30mins 😂

[13-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
how are you doing the pool?

[13-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
I can show everyone the simple way to do it

[13-Nov-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
just editing transactions.js directly

[13-Nov-18 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`nearly have the proper pool done`
Why do I doubt that? :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I told everyone how I did this 1000x

[13-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its works pefectly

[13-Nov-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does the payment processor work 🤞

[13-Nov-18 11:48 AM] Alright#0419

    tx.addOutput(

        Math.round(blockReward) + feeReward

    // pool fee recipients t-addr

I dont understand why you ond just use my way

[13-Nov-18 11:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but whatever

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
because I don't understand it

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
this way was just a simple hack

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its just a simple true feild in the coin.json

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
finished done ... works

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
perfectly

[13-Nov-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
pool address?

[13-Nov-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see how it cant be understood.. the stratum uses the coinbase tx fromt he daemon rather than making its own and determines the pool address by using the -pubkey set itn the daemon

[13-Nov-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
simple

[13-Nov-18 11:50 AM] jorian#4555
the power of the ecosystem: explorer up in an hour, pool up in 2 hours. diff explosion in 3 hours?

🚀 

[13-Nov-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once I get 1 payment confirmed I will post pool details for others

[13-Nov-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I dont see how it cant be understood.. the stratum uses the coinbase tx fromt he daemon rather than making its own and determines the pool address by using the -pubkey set itn the daemon`
I dont see how it cant be understood.. the stratum only needs 1 if change to change vout1 to a 2nd tx and done

[13-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but why in the hell does the startum need to make its own coinbase its non sensical

[13-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make no sense

[13-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wtf

[13-Nov-18 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just use the one the daemon makes

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it cna be anything

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷  😕

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for pool fees

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true, it makes far more sense to store extra data and complex math

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c his theory is take fees out later

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im not taking any fees 🤷

[13-Nov-18 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is afounder reward

[13-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats enogh fees already

[13-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I figure if this has any price .. .the coins I mine in the next 7H will pay for the pool for months

[13-Nov-18 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's fine for you and your temp pool, what about the longterm pools?

[13-Nov-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is a way to take fees... I will work it out

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why reinvent the wheel?

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's round and rolls

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because statums cannot pay all types of tx

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they just  wont

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it will sayt merkle fail or something every single time

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Alrights way needs a speical pool for each chain

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my way is a config change

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because statums cannot pay all types of tx`
not sure where you got that bit of misinformation from...

[13-Nov-18 11:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you 😂

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ac_perc ?

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you spent days on it

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
took me 4h to make it work with any tx at all

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100 bajilion times, I said __**I**__ can't follow the conversion of buffers not that it can't be done

[13-Nov-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
dude I just need to understand how to use it and I will

[13-Nov-18 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can't mirror finish concrete, that doesn't mean it can't be done

yes but if there is a very easy way to do it that doesnt take days of dicking around to get no where... why not just do it that way

[13-Nov-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need `mastertest` branch of StakedChain/komodo

[13-Nov-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a very simple change to daemon, I can PR to FSM later ifd james says its ok...

[13-Nov-18 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everythign is backwards compatible

[13-Nov-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`days of dicking around to get no where` dude, the feken code is already there in any fork that doesn't use my stripped repo

[13-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
what change is needed in FSM to support the pool?

[13-Nov-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r ? 👆🏽

[13-Nov-18 12:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
none, right? because you went around it?

its in that ... I added an extra "mode" which were all disabled before

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it instead just submits the coinbase as tx 0

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
isntead of a seperate json object

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the pool reads the config bool, and if true

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses that mode instead of the normal one

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is 100% backward compatible?

[13-Nov-18 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
