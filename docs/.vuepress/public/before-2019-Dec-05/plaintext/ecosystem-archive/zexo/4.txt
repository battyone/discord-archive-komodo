You have to change the template of it does a merkle tree error .. i fucked around with it for ages

will there be ports for ASIC and nicehash?

something wrong with the method I posted above. Worked in testing, trying to figure out what I changed

[13-Nov-18 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ bottomline is @blackjok3r released the first working pool, so whatever he did cant be so silly

[13-Nov-18 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Id rather change 1000 lines of C++ in the daemon that change 50 line sof java script ... it made my head explode

[13-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the point also is this way makes it possible to mine CC vouts aswell

[13-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can even have CC tx constricted in create block

@Alright  
instructions for pool:
```
until I submit PR to jl777 repo, you NEED this branch of komodo 
https://github.com/StakedChain/komodo/tree/mastertest 
You need this pool:
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/Knomp
or more specifically this stratum:
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/node-stratum-pool
and you rneed to add :
"disablecb": true
To the end of the coin.json file inside knomp/coins```

[13-Nov-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181

the min and max don't really matter

[13-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
make them tiny and huge and just set diff to something that makes sense for current network diff

[13-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Alright#0419
if min is too low, it'll eat up your bandwidth though

[13-Nov-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahhh so you need to change the diff part not the range ... no wonder my KMDICE pool wsa feked

[13-Nov-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
8192 is the "generally accepted" multiplier to get from diff1/target to netdiff (although it's "generally" wrong)

[13-Nov-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
