[13-Nov-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
seed is live

[13-Nov-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first founders chain hey ... 😃

[13-Nov-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ZEX needs a pool

[13-Nov-18 09:47 AM] jorian#4555
when hashrate more than KMD?

[13-Nov-18 09:47 AM] jorian#4555
what is ZEX?

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] jorian#4555
no connection here either

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ANN should come out today

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can do a pool for these chains 😃

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I am connecting to it without any issues from any nodes

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will set one up and try confirm its working in a few hours.

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
"connections": 13,

[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] jorian#4555
do you live in china?

[13-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have a stratum pool that works with these

[13-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you want to use it web

[13-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It passes the coinbase directly to the stratum

[13-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so there cant be a pool fee

[13-Nov-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
othereeise ive been minign with it on CFEKED for a couple days no issue now

[13-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The suggested way for the pool to get a fee was to spoof some free shares 😃

[13-Nov-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either case I will do a pool right now for this 😄

[13-Nov-18 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or someone could build a stratum for it that isn't a nomp fork...
#JustSayin

[13-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as an example ... it wont be staying up long term... im not a good pool operator,

[13-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why would you bother to do that ... when you can just do what I did ?

[13-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its like 10 lines of extra code 😂

[13-Nov-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
although the deamon needs a patch .. so I will use stakedchain komodo fork to run the pool so it cna actually work.

[13-Nov-18 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Why would you bother to do that ...`
Yes, why would we the people of the Komodo ecosystem want something new that isn't 9th generation fekery?

[13-Nov-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
has anyone been able to connect to the network?

[13-Nov-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
might need to change the seed node

[13-Nov-18 09:59 AM] jorian#4555
no it's working now. very latest is needed

[13-Nov-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what i meant when i say use the latest version

[13-Nov-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
though even beta branch should work

[13-Nov-18 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm just merged FSM down to staked.. I assume that will also work ?

[13-Nov-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Nov-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
all changes needed for ZEX was merged into all branches other than master, the other day

i see

[13-Nov-18 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its syncing with staked mastertest just fine pool soon

[13-Nov-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
sync should take seconds

[13-Nov-18 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it stopped at  226 for a while but ended up working just fine.

[13-Nov-18 10:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I rebuilt from there and same result

[13-Nov-18 10:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CMaurice did you use FSM branch?

[13-Nov-18 10:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am using staked branch mastertest with the very tip of FSM merged in .. already have a few blocks

[13-Nov-18 10:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
nope, master.

[13-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
about the ANN: the chain parameters say that there is a halving every 525600 blocks. that is 365 days, so yearly. with a block reward of 130 ZEX per block, and if my math is right, we come at a MAX supply of 136,656,000 approximately after 35 years.

[13-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
oh wait

[13-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
so 70 ZEX goes to the founders

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] gt#2812
can’t get it to load using stake but fine with regular

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] That_Guy8#4893
did a pool go up for use ?

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not yet .. im on it but it wil take a while to make sure its 100% working

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hour or 2 max

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so 70 ZEX goes to the founders` counting the 10 in the premine?

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] That_Guy8#4893
no worries good work mate, do you have a repo for the nomp you used?

[13-Nov-18 10:32 AM] jorian#4555
no premine i think?

[13-Nov-18 10:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`$ komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX getinfo | jq '.premine'

[13-Nov-18 10:33 AM] jorian#4555

[13-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Nov-18 10:35 AM] SHossain#0007
new chain... wow

[13-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jorian#4555
oh there it is. diff blow up in 3... 2... 1...

[13-Nov-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh the normal pool might work with founders ... but this is a perfect test for my new stratum changes

[13-Nov-18 10:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mining % BR to a CC conract is just sooo cool 🐲

[13-Nov-18 10:38 AM] SHossain#0007
daemon crashes with knomp running

[13-Nov-18 10:41 AM] SHossain#0007
running with gdb to catch any backtrace

[13-Nov-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Short of the vout1, there's no difference in the cb tx, so if it doesn't work in nomp "out of the box" it shouldn't take but maybe 1 if statement to make it work

[13-Nov-18 10:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pool is working here 😄

[13-Nov-18 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[13-Nov-18 10:43 AM] That_Guy8#4893
So I appear to have it running but not gaining connections is there something that must be changed on the coin.conf?

[13-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mehh

[13-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
go for it  ... its not ready to let ppl mine on it yet

[13-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
35% of all the coins you mine are going to someone else 😛

[13-Nov-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I thaught you hated that ...

[13-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Nov-18 10:45 AM] CMaurice#1685
I have built FSM still just connections refused

[13-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jorian#4555
my rpcport is something different though

[13-Nov-18 10:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`35% of all the coins you mine are going to someone else`
No, 36% of all the coins people in chickenpool mine are going to someone else :trollface:

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
p2pport is what matters

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```>>>>>>>>>> ZEX: p2p.26476 rpc.26477 magic.629ce350 1654448976 10 coins```

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if you launched with an older version it would have set it to a different rpc port

[13-Nov-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but rpc port is a local thing
