No way, I know what I have

We are doing something very cool with our Explorer that no one else has done.  I should have some updates by the end of this week.

I'm curious ü§î

[22-Oct-18 05:39 AM] gsnew#5366
Very nice, I can see the GLXT Balance in my Agama again.

[27-Nov-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so existing glx tokens will have a use?

[30-Nov-18 10:53 PM] gsnew#5366
as far as I know it's planned that way

[06-Dec-18 03:02 PM] glx#4214
Yes of course

[06-Dec-18 03:02 PM] glx#4214
We are almost done with our explorer

[06-Dec-18 03:03 PM] glx#4214
And many other blockchain updates

[06-Dec-18 05:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So the glx coins I already hold are probably worth 100x already? üòú

[07-Dec-18 10:33 AM] glx#4214
ha ha yes they will be and we are about to start a major campaign and airdrop to the Komodo community!

[07-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
sweet, hodl!

[07-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Paul#0981
what about those who have their KMD¬¥s on the ledger?

[07-Dec-18 11:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If airdropped, you can login to agama with kmd privkey to glx wallet

[07-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Paul#0981
that sounds a bit too complicated to me because my privatkey is on the Ledger

[07-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There are ways, there was a guide on how to access ZILLA after the airdrop, let me search

[07-Dec-18 03:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Paul I think for now you need to extract your privkeys from your ledger and use these to login to agama and the glx wallet

ok thank you

[08-Dec-18 07:58 AM] glx#4214
Guys I am struggling with the Agama wallet. There does not seem to be a way to create and sign transactions totally offline and then execute them online completely protecting your private key or seed.  Everything in the tools section is in beta.  Does anyone know of a way to do this?

[08-Dec-18 07:59 AM] glx#4214
Yes if other Komodo tokens like GLXT or Zilla get send to your Ledger KMD address they will be in the wallet but Ledger does not recognize them therefore they will not be visible. If you check the explorer they will be there.

[08-Dec-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain offline signing was just added, not sure the details, but it is probably in experimental features

[08-Dec-18 09:20 AM] glx#4214
I will test it

[08-Dec-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
@glx i have a guide ready that will be published with the next agama release.

[08-Dec-18 11:16 AM] SHossain#0007
After your report, we considered polishing the experimental feature to make it work. I have tested this and it works. Have patient for few more days please.

How is everyone doing?  I am going to be sending out the email below to every exchange in existence.  If anyone has any exchange relationships that can help us list we would appreciate the help. Also I am willing to pay a lot on some deep discounted pre-sale to kick off marketing if you have any investors?

GLX.com has created Polymath ST20 compliant tokens with the symbol ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúXA‚Äù for our current Series A $2 million raise. We have structured a Reg CF for U.S. citizens that will be listed on the StartEngine.com platform and a Reg S to reach offshore investors.

Following our Series A GLX will be doing a $25 million Tier II Reg A+ token offering as well. With the promotions we have lined up we feel GLX is going to be the hottest STO of the first half of this year.

We are looking for additional exchanges to list our offering and would like to work with you. Please fill out our listing survey here so we can get in touch - https://glx.co/sto

I look forward to hearing from you.

[30-Jan-19 09:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
still the same GLX tokens as previously shortly available on barterdex?

[30-Jan-19 09:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What is sto price?

[31-Jan-19 11:00 AM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon No, GLXTs are our network tokens created on the GLX asset chain on the Komodo platform.  The current raise is being done with equity tokens created on the Polymath platform which is Ethereum backed.  The symbol is X for US citizens and and XA for those outside the US.  After we are funded and really launch the GLX platform we will focus on building membership and the GLXT token economy.

[31-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why not use a kmd asset chain for the current raise?

[31-Jan-19 12:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And what to do with GLX tokens I bought back in the day @glx ?

[31-Jan-19 02:09 PM] glx#4214
@Cryptoon Has anyone to date used a Komodo Chain to create a security token?  I do not think it would be easy to create the compliance features.

[31-Jan-19 02:17 PM] glx#4214
Our plan is to develop value to the GLXT Network Tokens and the GLX economy in the future. That said anyone holding GLXTs please sign up at GLX.com; go to your profile and under the tab "Contact Details" there is a section called "Add Crypto Address"; Please add your GLXT address where we can verify the amount of GLXTs held and also add your ETH address. Email us a note after you do this to x@glx.com and we will bonus transfer you the equiviliant dollar value of GLX Equity Tokens and you will also keep your GLXTs as well.

[31-Jan-19 04:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @PTYX and Chainzilla can do STO's

compliance depends on the jurisdiction in which you are launching and operating

[31-Jan-19 05:00 PM] glx#4214
In all honesty guys my GLX Chain deosn't even function properly. It has been a little disappointing. I cannot even transfer tokens. We have been trouble shooting for months and it's still nto smooth?

[31-Jan-19 05:43 PM] SHossain#0007
@glx Did you try latest Agama with native mode? Is your wallet 100% synced? If there was any issue did you rescan or reindex? There is a absolutely 0 reason for a wallet not to work unless local or user issues.

[31-Jan-19 05:53 PM] SHossain#0007
What exact issue you have?

[31-Jan-19 06:36 PM] glx#4214
I will need to update my wallet and retest.

[31-Jan-19 06:37 PM] glx#4214
@SHossain should it also work from the web wallet?

[31-Jan-19 06:38 PM] SHossain#0007
it should work. but, using Agama or KomodoOceanQT wallet locally is much safer

[31-Jan-19 06:38 PM] SHossain#0007
and, you would know what is the issue

[31-Jan-19 06:57 PM] glx#4214
@SHossain I hope to test this weekend

@RubRiches Yes we will be doing that

[06-May-19 10:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The issue was because of a high supply chain. A big utxo got moved to agama and it didnt want to move it back since agama could not handle big utxos of 500million or 1 billion coins

[06-May-19 10:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It seems like this issue has been resolved in native mode.

[06-May-19 10:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@SHossain

[06-May-19 10:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Similar issue has happened with other high supply chains of 10billion or more.

[06-May-19 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
we advised GLX team to use native mode with huge amount of coin during the past year.

[06-May-19 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
