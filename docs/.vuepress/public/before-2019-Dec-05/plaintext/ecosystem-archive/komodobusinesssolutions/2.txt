Hi is here where I can ask about dICO? We're thinking of launching one in Komodo

[24-Sep-18 07:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hello @Fai ,You can talk to @PTYX  @siu - Chainmakers @jorian  channels #chainmakers  #chainzilla  these people have already conducted dICO  or  are in process of and can advice you.

[24-Sep-18 08:04 AM] Fai#0350
Thanks @CHMEX. Hi @PTYX  @siu - Chainmakers @jorian  

The problem is we see many blockchain smart contracts donate (or claim to) to charities with smart contract. But the downstream flow of the tokens is quite opaque and not as traceable.

I'm working on TreeLand. A Blockchain foundation which helps donors trace their donation to a specific tree using drones (proof of plant) powered by the blockchain. We want to introduce trust and transparency never seen before to the space. A world where honest tree planters get rewarded manifold to be able to multiply their good work.‚Ä®

The first eco-friendly crypto currency that supports cross-chain carbon offset. We want to connect with as many crypto currencies in current and other chains as possible so they too can become a green crypto-currency. And we can proof that with how many trees they planted and carbon offset

[24-Sep-18 09:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Fai hi and welcome. I think that using a blockchain in conjunction with gateways CC you might be able to do just that.

[24-Sep-18 01:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Fai  yes @siu - Chainmakers  or @PTYX  are the guys you need to talk to.   KBS is for a different aspect of business üëç

That sounds exactly like what Bosque Guardian is doing

[24-Sep-18 02:06 PM] PTYX#6840
Even the part about drone footage. @Fai how about instead working with Bosque Guardian to use the same Guardian Coin?

[24-Sep-18 02:06 PM] PTYX#6840
Is that something you are open to discuss?

[24-Sep-18 02:52 PM] Fai#0350
@PTYX Always open to a discussion. üòÉ I think from a vision and scope point of view we differ so TreeLand need to build our own network. Does Bosque Guardian have any ideas on collaboration?

[24-Sep-18 02:58 PM] PTYX#6840
As far as I know Bosque is just the first project of Guardian Coin. They want to apply the same model in other places. Currently they have acquired nearly 100 hectares of land. They are slowly acquiring all of the surrounding land that sits in the buffer zone. I think there are areas that can overlap and there could be some collaboration by both projects.

[24-Sep-18 02:59 PM] PTYX#6840
can you send us more information to hello@chainzilla.io and I we can schedule a meeting to talk about tokenization and the options Komodo offers

[24-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Fai#0350
Sounds good @PTYX. Will speak with my partners first tomorrow

[24-Sep-18 03:28 PM] Fai#0350
Loving this Komodo community btw. You have no idea how hard it is to speak with someone when exploring VeChain lol

lol I had to carry them ,  guy tried knocking real quick and running away but I was in ambush üôÇ. 25 z9 full size .  This week or next depending on power company will be a bit hectic.   I'll have to hook up 260ish miners.  But once that's out of the way, it's just chiseling away at the barter exchange between doing Komodo things.

@BlackJesus  nice well if you need any space we will be having several locations to put miners up if needed

I'll definitely be in later especially when I build out

Pretty much done except some cleanup and B3s ,  just waiting on a PDU and some cables.  The next batch of miners ( baikals and other cheap used ones ) are next and will be dripping in over the next couple months.  That should fill this place out electrically.  Then we have some empty houses to fill up before deciding to expand this site or try to find older industrial buildings on the cheap to tap their electric hookups.  Since the big part of the mining operation is done  keep an eye on for posts on the barter exchange coming up soon!

This looks like a cool project. What is your planned total hash rate? Are these personal, or for business purposes?

[07-Oct-18 01:10 PM] PTYX#6840
@polycryptoblog looking good

[07-Oct-18 01:11 PM] PTYX#6840
Are you securing the area? That's alot of equipment

[07-Oct-18 08:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@NutellaLicka   No planned total because what gets mined and how much of it can change pretty quickly,  for now mainly just focusing on equihash and playing it by ear,  picking up cheap miners for less popular algorithms and keeping an eye out for news ones as they debut. these are for business purposes,  they will be  producing coin as goods for barter in the exchange.   Coins are pretty liquid especially compared to direct double coincidence of wants typically required of barter.

[07-Oct-18 08:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PTYX  yes,  all the doors have been replaced with steel ones,  the bay doors have been replaced and we have security cameras being installed this week.  Also have a fence surrounding the property
