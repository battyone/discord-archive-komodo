Planning to bring some positive energy to Utrecht and throw a blockchain & gaming event there soon

[19-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Regnar#6164
So I'm assuming the game store would be a website right?

[19-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Regnar#6164
@Seko you should get in here 😄

[19-Mar-19 11:25 AM] barv#0867
Also started planning a blockchain & gaming talk in  Amsterdam now 💥

[19-Mar-19 12:06 PM] Seko#7408
I have many Html5 games and licenses, but so far not based on blockchain.

[19-Mar-19 01:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm sure you have a ton of insight to help out here with it Seko, @FishyGuts ^^^

[19-Mar-19 02:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg the current game reels are native apps, so yes, the store will be a website (but probably create a native app too).

[19-Mar-19 02:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Seko we always welcome like minded and game developers

[19-Mar-19 02:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@barv awesome

[19-Mar-19 02:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
meanwhile, I got the basic gear for streaming, with an antispit microphone, now just figuring out how this baby works

[19-Mar-19 02:31 PM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
As soon as you get some results, I'll send out some tweets.

seems like a pretty cool dude to have in the community

[19-Mar-19 07:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Mylo loved the breakdown, awesome writing, very insightful!

[19-Mar-19 07:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
minor note a screamer of a game has roughly 50k downloads, where the target is between 100k and 250k. Those are the ones that get nominated.

[20-Mar-19 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
tyvm  I did not mention Unity3d in it for (hopefully) obv reasons

[20-Mar-19 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Maybe I update 10k screamer to 100k :)

[20-Mar-19 04:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Check #official📢  for latest TT week 12 on custom BC game dev tools

[20-Mar-19 05:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Mylo yup, I think also that the tooling should not just focus on Unity but also include Unreal. Working on that though 😂😂😂

[20-Mar-19 05:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I wish I was faster but I am still partial human. I do need sleep and food too 😅

[20-Mar-19 06:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Alrighty, time for the update! So, I am wrapping some stuff up, to make sure everything good in the legal department with a privately held entity (games, intellectual property, yada yada). I made a massively big boillerplate that allows me to whip out games fast and easy. Meanwhile in the batcave today, UX and UI wizards are thinking about the arcade hall and every fancy buttons. As you all know already, that crazy stuff is already named and baptized with Komodore64. I set up a blank Twitter account, @komodoregames don't expect much interaction at this point, but slowly towards the end of this week, things will become more "tangible".

[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, I got a green role as ecosystem developer; looks like I have mild super powers. My coffee tastes better suddenly, which could be just the sugar.

[20-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Last update for this morning; I managed to setup a streamer setup; microphone, camcorder, HDMI capturing, etc., which makes it possible to create a lab design the streaming process of the games as we go. Since Twitch, YouTube and others probably have heavily moderation and are overcrowded, I was thinking about to roll our own. I also read somewhere two smart peoples invented the flux capacitator that allows streaming over the blockchain with Komodo, so that's pretty awesome.

[20-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
A lot of people asked me about my business plan. My plan is simple, far from elegant and no fact sheet.

[20-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
1. Build team of best and brightest

[20-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
2. Gather resources.

[20-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
3. Build stuff.

[20-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
4. Deploy stuff.

[20-Mar-19 07:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
5. Buy big chair made out of swords

[20-Mar-19 07:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[20-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Regnar#6164
If Komodore64 arcade is going to be a website, do you have any thoughts on what type of wallet you will use? preferably not hot wallets, for liability purposes, maybe see if we can integrate Magnum or Guarda browser extension wallets? @PTYX any idea on this?

[20-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Regnar#6164
But likely need a custom wallet (maybe similar style as magnum/guarda, where keys are stored locally) but supports the various blockgames or gamechains coins and assets or w.e.

[20-Mar-19 01:47 PM] gcharang#6833
I don't know the current state of development, but there is agama-web that runs through browser but everything is stored in users computer

[20-Mar-19 01:50 PM] PTYX#6840
If we can use Agama it could be more flexible as a proof of concept and then later that can be integrated into fancier guis. Although Agama would be a hotwallet unless the user uses a cold storage address as a watch-only

[20-Mar-19 01:54 PM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking it would be more like Metamask. You access it just to make main transactions in crypto. The blockgame assets would still need their own wallet, the Komodore wallet

[20-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Regnar#6164
Congrats on your new green name @TwilightPunkster K64 😄

[20-Mar-19 03:36 PM] Meyse#0952
at first we are gonna build a desktop application, which is also a wallet, and a store (think steam like). The website will be for the games ofcourse, but to play and get them you need the desktop app first

[20-Mar-19 03:37 PM] Meyse#0952
its gonna be amazing

[20-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Mylo#8306
TT week 12 from yesterday goes on about deployment options available now, and in the future

[20-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Mylo#8306

Later lite mode.

[20-Mar-19 07:03 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse thanks for clearing that up

[20-Mar-19 07:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, regarding all the "details" around Komodore64, remember, we barely started all this fuzz up, I actually don't have a desk yet at The Hague Tech, but progress comes in small details. So, I rather disclose details about the what, how and why's when we are off the drawing table; I can't spend the day discussing details, so I try to give a daily update about things we are doing.

[20-Mar-19 07:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Secondly, @Meyse came with a horrible idea for a horrible gameplay that became something awesome. Now, we figured out the streaming part, we are talking with The Hague Tech about a streaming studio, had a brief meeting with a talented photographer who loves streaming technology and basically just as crazy, a phone call with an experienced PR/Event Manager in gaming, who also happens to be an ace in marketing.

Also, a poster was stuck on my front door with a super nintendo controller saying "Sleep, Eat, Repeat", we were partially dancing and not to forget, a really awesome talk to secure some financial stuff. I also had horrible chinese food in our local china town, talking with a high up municipality dude talking about shaping the future. Oh, I forced three people to install Chameleon.

Just finished up a new part of 6AME, which is now an integral part of the Unity SDK

[20-Mar-19 10:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
When you create logic in 6AME, its stored as an Unity asset, which makes them really easy to migrate from Unity versions. I am currently working to make its editing way more user friendly; however its runtime is still very, very beta.
