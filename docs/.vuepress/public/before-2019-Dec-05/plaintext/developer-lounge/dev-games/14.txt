[10-Mar-19 04:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, the good news is that I just build the very first executable with Unity. It's not a real playable game yet, but the important parts for the gameplay are made

[10-Mar-19 04:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so basically I made an almost demo RTS in 20 hours, taking it easy xD

ok now I am really off for a nap, gotta prep this stuff for Linux and Mac

[10-Mar-19 05:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
after my nap, I'll work on the buildings, stat objects, and use the bridge. Meanwhile keep on talking about how Komodo will change the world of blockgames

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@TwilightPunkster K64 if you need help purchasing asset packs, let‚Äôs do that.

[10-Mar-19 05:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Looking awesome.   I would LOVE to get my kids to do voices.   Do you have the ability to wait until tomorrow ?

I‚Äôll help you with funds for asset packs if needed. Let me know.

well afternoon technically üòõ

[10-Mar-19 11:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts wuaa awesome. Well, ehm, there are plenty asset packs out there and a lot of things that could totally could rock this development even more. Have you tried the preview build (no it is not a demo, not for testing, just to see what I am making screenies about) ? Anyway, just prepping so a Linux build is going to be possible too. Don't worry about too much what I need. However, financial boosts are always more than welcome and I could definitely use them to buy tools and toys.

[10-Mar-19 11:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
But basically, the most stuff is more fun to make myself.

[10-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
if you want to provide voices, or sound fx, please follow the same things I asked @Cryptofist to do; make sure they are equal in volume, sound good with headphones and without, recorded in equal volume. I can understand its fun for the little ones to help, but I rather not spend a hour in Audacity comparing 2 second sound bytes üòõ

[10-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL especially for you

Yay! @TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no worries it will take a while, just saw I probably have to hit that x86 dropdown box

[10-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Unity always takes machines hostage

[10-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
very inefficient xD

[10-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
meanwhile my Mac is doing the same things

[10-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, x86_64 is preffered üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 11:12 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[10-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Yea I do it looks awesome minor twerks her and there and besides that I‚Äôm really liking the concept

[10-Mar-19 11:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
kinda need to spin up and speed up

[10-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
No pressure tho

[10-Mar-19 11:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its just a proof of concept

[10-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Buddz1993#5380
üòÑ

[10-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
a full game like this is done in a team and takes like 3 months in minimum

[10-Mar-19 11:14 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Yes I know for a POC it‚Äôs real good .

[10-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and often a year with a 100K kickstarter backing community xD

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ahah at least you have more than me üòÜ

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
actually, it isn't even really a POC

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nobody wrote any requirements

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so technically its already done

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm

[10-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[10-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Buddz1993#5380

[10-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts wouldn't be a bad idea at all, a kickstarter like thing for blockgames on Komodo.

quick question about the game style btw.

[10-Mar-19 11:31 AM] Regnar#6164
random generated in fog, permadeath type?

[10-Mar-19 11:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well as off now, we are still talking about what would be the most fun thing to demo. I'm personally a fan of permadeath. A map could be procgen of course, but I don't think I want to spend too much time on that feature (this is just for fun)

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh sorry, proc gen is dynamically generated

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
"nerd jargon"

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm a permadeath fan too, especially within blockchain space, non-fungibles and such

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup yup

[10-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, spill your thoughts

[10-Mar-19 11:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

I've been playing a ton of those io games, usually multiplayer involving killing each other. but they often seem much quicker than what would constitute a chain. It seems there would be a cool place for longer gameplay pvp games, but not sure if that was in store here. good items should be hard to get imo, especially if they're on chain/traded

[10-Mar-19 11:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Well, just describe me the scenario's in a Gherkin like way

yes, when someone has a cool feature for a game project you just !feature one liner and bam, project management and documentation done like a boss

[10-Mar-19 11:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
