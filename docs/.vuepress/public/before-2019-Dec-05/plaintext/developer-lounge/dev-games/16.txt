You do you :)

[10-Mar-19 01:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
finished with quest markers

[10-Mar-19 03:21 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
building placement done, upgrade system in place, now working on "Kings Seat"

[10-Mar-19 03:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably gonna think about creating a skill tree, that must be reached before you can become a "king"

[10-Mar-19 03:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
integrated voice overs

[10-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I saw a pretty cool random city generator you might like @TwilightPunkster K64 

<https://watabou.itch.io/toy-town> 
No idea if it could be useful to you but figured I'd post it

[10-Mar-19 04:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nope, the idea of RTS is to build your own economy, or do the same versus a campaign map

[10-Mar-19 04:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thanks though

[10-Mar-19 04:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but shit is already looking awesome

[10-Mar-19 04:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

"be able to train your units against a cost over time" (Dungeon Keeper style)

[10-Mar-19 04:33 PM] Meyse#0952
I wants it, can't wait to hear the voice sounds too üòÑ

[10-Mar-19 05:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol

[10-Mar-19 05:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you gonna love what I've made, but I need a short break first, gonna eat food and powernap for a hour

basically an upgradable throne

[10-Mar-19 05:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
too bad this is a demo and not a fully backed project, else shit would've been even more awesome, but hey every game starts with a version 1

[10-Mar-19 05:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
üëÜ

[10-Mar-19 05:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Make it work with CCs and we will figure something out. üí™

[10-Mar-19 05:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
already bought some assets, but still it needs a little extra love

[10-Mar-19 05:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
else it would be just flipping and I dont like that

[10-Mar-19 05:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe it gets popular and a crowdfund after will do the trick

[10-Mar-19 05:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
wouldnt even take much

[10-Mar-19 05:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
code doesn't need to change, probably have modeler and 2d designer, an audio engineer and a level designer

[10-Mar-19 05:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe 30-40 days work, and there would be a super polished thing. But thats not now, so I just row with my magnificent self xD

{Reactions}
üëë 

[10-Mar-19 05:24 PM] Regnar#6164
Haha I will for sure chip in to the crowdfund, especially if I can get some non fungibles out of it by playing. What a cool way to calculate a ROI :P

[10-Mar-19 05:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[10-Mar-19 05:28 PM] Meyse#0952
Now I want to build a Komodo crowdfunding dapp, just a very advanced dico app+kickstarter in one app, that would be awesome

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[10-Mar-19 05:38 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea that would be cool. dICO would involve swapping some coins, but if coins are generated through gameplay it might be better to swap a special dICO NFT, that is in game, like a green kings robe, or a pet komodo dragon, probably non perfomance, but won't ever be available again. Give an incentive to pitch into the development fund (rare non fungible).

[10-Mar-19 05:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Easy peasy, probably the dICO thing and just throw in a parallax Vue powered template xD

[10-Mar-19 05:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Funding this game. Dico funder, I think that's all possible. Just need to explore it more and have the right people interrested in making it. 

I mean, look at this specific project, it became a decentralized game dev channel just from an initial boost from a few people  and then built from a community with ideas.

[10-Mar-19 05:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 can you make single use/permadeath tokens ? So give away a rare dragon unit, that is gone when it dies?

[10-Mar-19 05:44 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea definitely. I think people are used to buying early versions of games to get exclusive content and are comfortable with it, maybe even more so than buying ICO coins.

[10-Mar-19 05:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Legendary tokens that are balanced some how.

[10-Mar-19 05:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'd feel 100% on board with something that was focused on NOT being an ICO.

[10-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Meyse#0952
whats the difference between an ico and a crowdfunded game? nothing imo, except with an ico you get part of the "company", with crowdfunding you get early access or some fancy whatever whatever

[10-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Meyse#0952
whit crypto you can combine those and have a magical recipe

[10-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Both **would** be cool. 
Regulational BS is why I say otherwise.

[10-Mar-19 05:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
+/-  lawyer involvement.

[10-Mar-19 05:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
A platform wher you could do one or both at your own discretion would be super amazing.

[10-Mar-19 05:50 PM] Meyse#0952
who cares, if a group of people want to make a game they should just do so, AND get funding with crypto, i dont care about regulations

[10-Mar-19 05:53 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist I have this very simple philosophy; impossible is never an option. So, I could. But if I will, thats to be seen.

[10-Mar-19 05:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Never the less, a kickstarter like interface is almost a necessity to make crowdfunding work.

[10-Mar-19 05:55 PM] Meyse#0952
I could easily do interface/ux/branding üòÑ

{Reactions}
treasure 

[10-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool. I wasn't sure on the dynamics with the game itself.  @TwilightPunkster K64

[10-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Meyse  Are you a web dev and designer?

[10-Mar-19 06:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse if this becomes something bigger than a demo, absofuckinglutely - UX is probably one of the things that people under estimate in games

[10-Mar-19 06:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
coders are bad UX designers.

[10-Mar-19 06:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(in general)

[10-Mar-19 06:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
From the top of the map to the bottom, it takes 30 seconds to scroll, and 40 seconds for the basic unit to move.

[10-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, basically if a unit would walk the borders it will take 160 seconds to get back at starting point

[10-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sounds like a big enough map to me

[10-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Meyse#0952
@Cryptofist im a designer, in the broadest sense i would say. i just dont do code

[10-Mar-19 06:08 PM] Meyse#0952
@TwilightPunkster K64 yes, coders arent the greatest designers üòÑ but thats okay haha

[10-Mar-19 06:08 PM] Meyse#0952
pretty big map i guess yeah

[10-Mar-19 06:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, could easily be bigger, or could even make it seamless

[10-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Meyse#0952
it also sounds like a combo of a MOBA/RTS somehow

[10-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but its cool enough

[10-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hahaha indeed

[10-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its a combo of a lot of things

[10-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Regnar#6164
by seamless do you mean like a globe? kind of like Civilization type games? or pacman lol

[10-Mar-19 07:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
those are all seamless xD

[10-Mar-19 07:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
in technical sense

[10-Mar-19 07:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, to be specific, like Skyrim

[10-Mar-19 07:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you don't "feel" when the world ends.

[10-Mar-19 07:13 PM] Regnar#6164
ohh got ya. yea I like the mini earth feel. üòÉ

[10-Mar-19 07:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup

[10-Mar-19 07:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
to make the king thing more "real", instead of stranding solo, one starts with three worker units

[10-Mar-19 07:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
else, there will be a problem in creating the first orc xD

[10-Mar-19 07:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh wait

[10-Mar-19 07:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm

[10-Mar-19 07:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Trust me, a dICO has already been discussed üòâ

[10-Mar-19 07:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would think a kickstarter or crowdfund would fit better.

[10-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Meyse#0952
why?

[10-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Meyse#0952
maybe this will be the future. all games having their own little economy, with coins having a value that can be exchanged for something more "real" like btc or kmd

[10-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Meyse#0952
the more players the more the value rises

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[10-Mar-19 07:43 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
why not a combo xD

[10-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Meyse#0952
yes a combo is also FINE!

[10-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I think the dICO/crowd fund model makes sense. People are definitely used to buying early "packs" to get some unique stuff, probably non advantage based stuff though. which they can trade, or hold.

[10-Mar-19 08:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What do the dICO tokens buy?

[10-Mar-19 08:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Rare NFTs?   In game gold on launch?

[10-Mar-19 08:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A single currency in a dual currency system.

[10-Mar-19 08:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One is earned the other is crypto and can be bought.   The earned kind can be converted to crypto in game.

[10-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Meyse#0952
the earned kind and bought kind are the same no?

[10-Mar-19 08:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm doing this if I can.  Setting up a Corp tomorrow or Tuesday with Sam.  (RadioARRR tomorrow).  üëç

@Meyse you‚Äôre a gem for finding this gem.

[10-Mar-19 08:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Earned kind can‚Äôt be bought.

[10-Mar-19 08:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This allows for varying rewards for varying playstylrs but also

[10-Mar-19 08:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For the economy to allow for sales and switching across economies.  Gaming the economies would be what a large % of the players would play for.

[10-Mar-19 08:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sell their earned / grinded items for real cash.

[10-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont understand. a crypto is a crypto. you can earn GAMECOIN by playing, and you can buy GAMECOIN. with this GAMECOIN you can do/buy all kinds of stuff in your game (NFTs, etc.), you can also sell these NFTs and such for GAMECOIN. GAMECOIN is traded with other cryptocurrencies. The more player there are in your game -> the more buying pressure there is, the more the value of GAMECOIN rises

[10-Mar-19 08:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
K.  I hear what you‚Äôre saying. 
My question is how to bring value to a dICO token.  What‚Äôs the link/in game purpose?

[10-Mar-19 08:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As opposed to making a kickstarter and having people only interact with the token economy once the game releases?

[10-Mar-19 08:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would seem to curb legal issues of selling a ‚Äútoken for a future perceived value‚Äù.  
Remember I am in USSA üòâ

[10-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Meyse#0952
Ahh you are being held back by laws and such. But this is new territory, maybe some people dont care about it.

You can sell the coins for BTC/KMD, then the people who have the coins can shill the game, because they want the game to be good too and have lots of players, so their value in GAMECOIN rises. And you can sell special NFTs for GAMECOIN etc etc.

[10-Mar-19 08:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I hear ya.

[10-Mar-19 08:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm thinking more along the lines of creating the underlying tech for companies to license / use. 

To write design code test and release games is no small or cheap task.

[10-Mar-19 08:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But making the blockchain piece for gaming companies to tie into is great for many reasons.

[10-Mar-19 08:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They can take care of the hard exepmsive@oart while integration with KMD tech takes care of economies and cheaters.

[10-Mar-19 08:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Something like that.

[10-Mar-19 08:29 PM] Meyse#0952
Hmm okay, this target group is not interesting for me (tech companies and such) haha, I would like to see people who just want to create games are able to just do that without any hassle
