use apt-get dos2unix

[08-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
dos2unix on /zcutil and /depends

[08-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
running at the moment, probably a git config line ending conversion bla

[08-Mar-19 03:57 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, do they have the patent or did they apply for the patent?

[08-Mar-19 03:57 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I wonder the legal implications regarding this

[08-Mar-19 03:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I wouldn't care shit though xD

[08-Mar-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
seems just an application limited to a single country? and relates to multigame usage

[08-Mar-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
all depends on the scope of the claims that are granted and what existing open source projects they pretend dont exist

[08-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yes, its like using the same database for different applications

[08-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD

[08-Mar-19 04:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably trying to secure the market, Unity had a 400 million boost somewhere last year iirc, but at that time I was really sick

[08-Mar-19 04:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
correct 2 years back

[08-Mar-19 04:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think they had a second boost too

[08-Mar-19 04:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Anyway, that application might be because of the Enjin partnership, who were mostly talking about their amazing "multiverse"

[08-Mar-19 04:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm

[08-Mar-19 04:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have an idea

[08-Mar-19 05:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Seems very specific to me in the articles description, but very vague in some parts of the patent.  I feel like they researched til they found a unique white space use for blockchain and gave themselves a good bit of room.  http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=blockchain&OS=blockchain&RS=blockchain

[08-Mar-19 05:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Welcome to the world of Corporate Thought.

[08-Mar-19 05:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Indeed.

[08-Mar-19 05:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There's your legal loophole.

[08-Mar-19 05:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"Based on ethereum, not Blockchain.  Blockchain by definition should be immuteable and open source.  This patent only applies to Ethereum, a specific protocol that does not specifically cover all blockchain projects."

[08-Mar-19 06:19 PM] Artist#0765
@TwilightPunkster K64  hey bro sorry for replying late

[08-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Artist#0765
I am starting with mobile some hyper casual and some story based ideas, then AR then console

[08-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Artist#0765
need smart dudes in my team and stuff

[08-Mar-19 06:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Cool! Welcome. Have you made games before or is this your first project?

[08-Mar-19 06:24 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts awesome, still good to check someone who is an ace in the legal department.

[08-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Artist#0765
I just practiced I was in multiple fields apps before that web etc quitted to follow my passion so

[08-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Artist#0765
have ideas and stuff

[08-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Artist#0765
marketing plugs etc

[08-Mar-19 06:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Just got out of Blockchain Bar. Cool stuff and had fun! So I have imported some stuff into Unity, gonna grab something to eat and take a short powernap. After that, flame on

[08-Mar-19 06:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions did you got komodod to compile? Had some funky errors.

[08-Mar-19 06:30 PM] Artist#0765
I also wanted to implement blockchain in my games but can't understand what is the need why? whats the tech used in it

[08-Mar-19 06:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are a couple reasons.  My favorite I had a few weeks ago was "Cheaters can go fork themselves"

[08-Mar-19 06:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Verifiable gameplay and mechanic turn of events in tournament play.

[08-Mar-19 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
RTS like Starcraft and Warcraft 2/3 are big tourney games in Korea and other places in the world.   Having a verifiable sequence of events would make players, viewers and sponsors know who REALLY wins ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Mar-19 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Being able to trade items for real world value instead of in game gold.

[08-Mar-19 06:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's just a short list. @Artist

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Artist#0765
yeah I knew a bit like its mostly used in multiplayer stuff

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Artist#0765
well need a short team for a hyper casual game

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Artist#0765
idea that I have

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Single player games where player progress matters..

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
can have items/cahracters/skins treaded and verifiable.

[08-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Artist#0765
yeah its good

[08-Mar-19 06:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have an idea for a game, pitch it here.  People are watching ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Mar-19 06:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
ðŸ‘€

[08-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Artist  There is a variety of features you can add to a game if it has a blockchain.  In addition there are benefits between games and for the studio/company as well.    I'm getting ready to PM  you my book of conversations on the subject.

[08-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Artist#0765
what about bro I have heard that mining can be also done like through scripts people playing with internet and coins getting mined

[08-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Artist#0765
well I can't pitch here unfortunately its not a billion dollar idea xd @FishyGuts  xd its a simple hyper casual game but can say the million dollar idea I am working on is still in modeling phases xd but first I need to build hyper casual games so

[08-Mar-19 06:48 PM] Artist#0765
need good designer and one helping coder in it

[08-Mar-19 06:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Any ideas you don't need to keep as IP you are free to share here.   You may be surprised at the skill level of some people watching ðŸ˜ƒ

[08-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Artist#0765
I know that people are skilled xd will share if someone wants to work

[08-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Artist#0765
yeah want to keep IP on one of the ideas

[08-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Artist#0765
but not on hyper casual ones

[08-Mar-19 06:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sent the PM, feel free to ask as many questions as you want!

[08-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Artist#0765
thanks got it

[08-Mar-19 08:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist @FishyGuts for the RTS, can you think about what gameplay mechanic would be cool to play on the blockchain. Keep it simple, its a demo. Also play Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness to get that feel of the game again. I am gonna nap now and read up.

[08-Mar-19 08:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think a 1v1 would be cool.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
With set resources and a fresh map.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Winner can keep either aesthetic upgrades or starting resources upgrade perhaps?

[08-Mar-19 08:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This would require a matchmaking protocol but I think James could help there.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or a simple campaign mode.

[08-Mar-19 08:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
3 phase....
1 - Establish a basecamp and destroy the enemies. 
2 - Find and release the Dragon(Komodo) to fight for your side
3 - Retake the enemies base and save the queen?

[08-Mar-19 08:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Top scores can be defined by time?  
Also by completeness?

[08-Mar-19 08:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone else feel free to chime in.

[08-Mar-19 08:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 absolutely

[08-Mar-19 08:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts ask your kiddos too. I assume they have some understanding of Blockchain?

[08-Mar-19 08:33 PM] fmproductions#2904
@TwilightPunkster K64  okay, I see. Just tried to build the repo you linked earlier (master branch) with linux, also didn't succeed, got an error 127 or something (no further details)

[09-Mar-19 06:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions you need the fsm branch, but got still some errors too.

[09-Mar-19 06:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
They do Fist.  I will ask them about stories for the RTS.

[09-Mar-19 06:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think what is above is adequate for a demo though too.

[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
awesome thanks @FishyGuts

[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry, I went in a coma ðŸ˜„ I had 3 beers

[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Shouldn't drink beer in my condition but wow 8 hours sleep

[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that rarely happens xD

[09-Mar-19 07:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am thinking what will make a blockchain asset may be valuable in this demo

[09-Mar-19 07:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
a RTS isn't that hard to make as demo, but it isn't an inventory game

[09-Mar-19 07:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
for example what smart contracts would be applicable here?

[09-Mar-19 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Fair play - High scores for speed - Saving resources for future replays.

[09-Mar-19 07:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
resources / skins earned through performance.

[09-Mar-19 07:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
keep thinking out loud

[09-Mar-19 07:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we nerds call it duck debugging

[09-Mar-19 07:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably saving resources could be a thing, but eventually that wouldn't make it so interesting

[09-Mar-19 07:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
how about the map being created on the blockchain?

[09-Mar-19 07:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and that map has certain resources

[09-Mar-19 07:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and once you have won, you own the map

[09-Mar-19 07:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
until someone challenges you

[09-Mar-19 07:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe.
Let's see what James thinks.  
What sort of things would you blockchain in a Real Time Strategy game?
- Verifiable Gameplay, Cheaters Can fork off.
- Start point resources based on past performance as NFT
- Skins for items/buildings for past performance as NFT
Any other ideas @jl777c

[09-Mar-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i have no preference

[09-Mar-19 07:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Still not clear. I kind of want a very specific scenario or better a set of scenarios so I can forge this in the game. There are so many ways to cheat in these games (scruffs, trainers, etc.) and primarily focussing on that will be out of scope for a demo. If its good enough, we can actually plan a good game, this is just "hey, we jammed this baby"

[09-Mar-19 07:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
one idea I had was to have cryptokitty orcs

[09-Mar-19 07:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
having their own dna, which could be blended if you sacrifice them to the Ogre god, having the best of two attributes

[09-Mar-19 07:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
That being said, you keep units as "collectable cards" like as in Magic: The Gathering; prior the game begins you can pick 5 units from your "unlimited deck".

[09-Mar-19 07:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so instead of keeping resources, you will have to begin each map with minimal resources and work out your economy.

[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts is your artist friend someone who can whip out a model fast?

[09-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there should be a komodo mascotte xD

[09-Mar-19 08:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
perhaps sacrificing cryptokitties could be implemented via etomic where you can truly sacrifice them for unique attributes. that would be hilarious and awesome.

[09-Mar-19 08:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
kittie slayer

[09-Mar-19 08:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
evil and blood... I like it

[09-Mar-19 08:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
The OG Command and conquer is the GOAT rts for me. thinking about how I would  implement blockchain in that type of game makes my  head spin a little though.

[09-Mar-19 08:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup thats why I am asking
