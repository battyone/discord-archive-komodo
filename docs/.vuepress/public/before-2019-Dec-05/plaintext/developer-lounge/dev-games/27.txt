I had to shoehorn my way in there pretty hard üòú
It was 15 mins before time and they were talking about cutting it, I convinced Alon the promoter it would be worth it.  Then I bought him a beer. üëç

[10-Apr-19 07:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
About 50-60 people were milling about by the time I finished.  

During the day the biggest crowd I saw besides the pomp chat was about 10 people.   I‚Äôm glad the opportunity came up.

‚Äú @2ndOldest I enjoyed that talk on the panel towards the end before Stache bunch went up‚Äù
Received this message already.   Some people were listening / watching.  ü§î

Coin boys podcast is ready to talk and start making content for May/June.  I spoke with them for about 20 minutes.  Good guys.  

Crypto and gaming based podcast.   K64 gives them 2 for the price of one.

[10-Apr-19 07:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Vosk is as well, we still need to sit and chat about that. üëç
Hope you got some rest.  I‚Äôm headed to bed.

We are going to need about 100 testers for UltraFighter K64. As a requirement, it is mandatory you have some experience with blockchain, you are computer savvy enough to know your system specs (these will be required to make a "supported" list). You can find our Discord invite link in #komodore64, do ping me there.

this is the dungeon geometry wars style game, the "new bloke" is making.  also wants to add tokenization but isn't quite as keen on a mobile version of the game, wants to go down console route...

both want to add tokenization to their gamification model of hyper-casual genre...

[23-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Mylo#8306
this is the type of game project cakeshop NN candidacy is for.   the maze one we definitely can go mobile.   console, not sure - only a friend of a friend atm.    cakeshop-in-a-box is my pet project, more dex than game related, but have a lemonade style text CC game for plans.

[24-Apr-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo where can I see how these games actually interact with the blockchain, making transactions/etc ?

[24-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Mylo#8306
you can't.   it hasn't been made.   and this is what i hope to see done with komodore64 games sdk.
otherwise, it will be CEX style token claiming via REST

[24-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Mylo#8306
until CC signing can be done in "lite mode" it'll be CEX style gaming.
