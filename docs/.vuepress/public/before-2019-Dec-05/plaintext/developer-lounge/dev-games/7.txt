basically abusing JS to act like what solidity does

[08-Mar-19 07:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Remix uses a JavaScript VM and in production it uses the Ethereum VM

[08-Mar-19 07:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, I thought, hey that shit is done in WebGL and in Meteor too

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so I basically tore out the wrappers

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, basically, in a madness kinda way

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you could just it as a Chrome Extension (utter useless)

[08-Mar-19 07:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
BUT BUT BUT

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
remember my nasty eval UnityScript

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
da da da da da da

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
SO

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I took bamboos implementation

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] fmproductions#2904
eval, haha. 
feed everything as a string and it just works‚Ñ¢

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and kicked half of that crap out

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
right right haxory haxory

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
THERE SHALL BE ONLY ONE

[08-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mwuahhahahahahah

[08-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, basically 6AM runs in Unity in Play Mode xD xD xD

[08-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
utter useless too

[08-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but basically I want it to be able to be embedded in anything that has a JS layer

[08-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but the grand idea is basically put it on top as a wrapper

[08-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the code is 100% haxe friendly, and C transpilable

[08-Mar-19 07:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so that shit should be dope enough on Unreal too, and it now works mostly as a logic layer / bridge to Komodo

[08-Mar-19 07:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, from Unreal / Unity, basically use similar API and map it against 6AM

[08-Mar-19 07:47 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
pretty much the basics of application integration with crapsy connectors / transformers / adapters

[08-Mar-19 07:47 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but you know I hate that jargon crap

[08-Mar-19 07:47 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
brb compile complete need to test

[08-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh god this is so good

[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

the FSM branch straight from jl its almost like the bleeding edge thingie we need

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
compile that baby, probably good to move through the docs as you go

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] fmproductions#2904
alright, 
last time I checked there was a js interpreter for unreal engine, the asset basically slaps the interpreter code on an actor and you just have to place it in the level. not sure if that would be helpful in any way though, I suppose not

[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, stick with developer.komodo, docs.komodo is outdated, yet the low level stuff is in the docs too

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, I can always just ping fholm

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we worked on IronJS and I know he did something with it for Unreal

[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably gonna need him for the super networking stuff too

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Maybe maybe

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
how does Unreal handle plugins?

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
can we DLL slap shit in it?

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@jl777c are you watching this?

[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and run things in a separate thread

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It makes excited and I have no clue what they‚Äôre talking about.

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts the man has important things to do üòÉ

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
everyone wants JL time, we shouldn't deprive ourselves of using his time unless we can use it to the max

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically its better to talk here in the open so there is a log of things and ideas in the open; who wants to pitch in or ask a question can simple rock and roll with us

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Now you know he‚Äôs watching.  I was just being silly.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yep.

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
100%

[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] fmproductions#2904
yeah, you can link a c++ dll

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD JL is the all seeing eye - not the dude from lord of the rings, but the bearded dude in the clouds kinda eye

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions mhm, maybe maybe

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
LUA

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
how does LUA handle crap

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
shit blockchain bar thingie coworking in a hour

[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
dammit

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] fmproductions#2904
there is a lua plugin for around 35 bucks, 
but there also seems to be an older lua project (lscript), but haven't tried any of those. This last one seems rather old though, probably not supported anymore

[08-Mar-19 08:07 AM] fmproductions#2904
nevermind, there is also an official unreal wiki page on lua integration

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yeah, but does it come with source?

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
official wikis are shite

[08-Mar-19 08:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we need open source stuff

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there, exchange it, buy it

[08-Mar-19 08:10 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
benefit of being sick is that I never go anywhere, so you use it

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
man if only KMD was like a currency everywhere

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
with this bot life would be so easy

[08-Mar-19 08:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the baker dude around the corner has discord too

mmmm

[08-Mar-19 08:13 AM] fmproductions#2904
well, since you just mentioned it, I dig a bit on the store page, and it seems like we are lucky, 
this seems like an aseprite deal, or even better, you can get the plugin from the store to support the dev or you can get it for free on github and it has an mit license. wow

[08-Mar-19 08:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
woot

[08-Mar-19 08:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
someone should find the MIT license dude or dudette, fly over there and fucking hug him or her

[08-Mar-19 08:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Thanks for feedback @TwilightPunkster K64 . PSP's are meant as 'a console'. Good you point out that you take it literally, others might too. I'll will express this while presenting.

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts probably gonna work on the game stuff at BCB, need to setup that on my Windows box anyway, which has a great videocard and prep the unity project - will send some screenies during the day

[08-Mar-19 08:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

hahahahahahaha @FishyGuts 0.5.2 works "partially", but it works good enough, so old solidity remark might be just solidity, but will work on that later

[08-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Artist#0765
so one of the pioneers told me game Dev stuff going on

[08-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Artist#0765
I am also a game dev

[08-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Artist#0765
had ideas and stuff

[08-Mar-19 10:17 AM] Artist#0765

@fmproductions doing a windows build, seems like line endings were a bit fucked up, did you face that stuff (osx/linux builds were fine), using bash linux subsystem

[08-Mar-19 12:46 PM] fmproductions#2904
can occasionally happen it seems, but didn't have problems with it yet

[08-Mar-19 12:49 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
did you compile from src?

[08-Mar-19 12:49 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically at the last step, but I was lazy, seemed that line endings were a bitch

[08-Mar-19 12:52 PM] fmproductions#2904
oh, no, haven't done that

[08-Mar-19 12:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, the fetch thingie, and the build thingie script are definitely not having the line endings, so EOL -> Unix
