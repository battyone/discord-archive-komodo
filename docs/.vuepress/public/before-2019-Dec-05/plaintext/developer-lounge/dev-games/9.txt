give me a bean and I'll make it a magical one.

[09-Mar-19 08:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Still need the fucking bean though

[09-Mar-19 08:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Magic comes with its limits

[09-Mar-19 09:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
Things like this usually just pop in from out of the blue. I think if we iterate over what we want the blockchain part to do enough, maybe it's best application will magically appear.

[09-Mar-19 09:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no

[09-Mar-19 09:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats bad gamedev

[09-Mar-19 09:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically, I am now importing typical stuff, fix game mechanics, convert fonts, write shaders for the look and feel

[09-Mar-19 09:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but its based on an existing game

[09-Mar-19 09:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Warcraft 2

[09-Mar-19 09:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
blockchain isn't an add-on, but it should be a fundamental

[09-Mar-19 09:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its like when someone says, "lets add joypad support later"

[09-Mar-19 09:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats what rookies do, and they fuck up a game before it even gets released

[09-Mar-19 09:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
any individual player advantage enabled by blockchain would ruin that type of game playability wise I would think

[09-Mar-19 09:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
I like the maps idea

[09-Mar-19 09:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but what and why

[09-Mar-19 09:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what would be beneficial to use the blockchain

[09-Mar-19 09:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
because its like building a ferrari and say, hey, lets add a blockchain to it

[09-Mar-19 09:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
might seem cool for some, but I find it fanboy mentality

[09-Mar-19 09:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
added-value

[09-Mar-19 09:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry I am always a dick prior doing something awesome

[09-Mar-19 09:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
not dickish at all mate. this is serious business

[09-Mar-19 09:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
some people just like to go back to the drawing board every iteration or try to fit a brick inside a newborn baby's ear. I just like Freddy Mercurify shit. Pass the test first time.

[09-Mar-19 09:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
you have a seed for a randomly generated map that you get to keep associated with your pubkey if you win? you can trade the map, sell it, the blockchain insures that that exact map wont be used or generated by anyone else otherwise that would constitute a double spend.

[09-Mar-19 09:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats basically the thing I'm going for

[09-Mar-19 09:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats the WC2 game classic from blizzard

[09-Mar-19 09:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe your progression on the tech tree is tied to your pubkey? The tech tree would be gigantic

[09-Mar-19 09:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
balls I should have Discord nitro

[09-Mar-19 09:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
stupid upload limits

[09-Mar-19 09:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
pfff will do screenies later

[09-Mar-19 09:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
god this is sexy

[09-Mar-19 09:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
unit generation or resource gathering buffs that accumulate. Its all unfair advantage to noobs though

[09-Mar-19 09:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts @Cryptofist can you do orc voices that instead of the classic "woik woik" say "mine mine", "mmmhhh crypto" and a battlecry "Koomodooo!"

I got a good mic, but I am in Unity, Visual Studio and Krita

[09-Mar-19 09:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:22 AM] actionslacks#4072

YES

[09-Mar-19 09:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
YESSSSS

[09-Mar-19 09:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hodddlll would be fucking epic

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes

[09-Mar-19 09:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I like it

[09-Mar-19 09:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we need a short story intro too

[09-Mar-19 09:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions wake up

[09-Mar-19 09:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions I'm on overdrive, I need you for some stuff

[09-Mar-19 09:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Instead of orcs vs dwarves or whatever it could just be like imaginary crypto coin projects fighting each other. you start with your node and generate your wallets. the coins are like resources. you need power. the troops are like devs walking around with macbooks

[09-Mar-19 09:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
first orc vs orc, more models require more logic

[09-Mar-19 09:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
unless you can whip up and crack up some

[09-Mar-19 09:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh wait

[09-Mar-19 09:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I'll buy some

[09-Mar-19 09:29 AM] fmproductions#2904
Oh hey, what's up?

[09-Mar-19 09:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
can you go through the windows compile crap, I still got some errors, and I hate Windows 10, that linux underneath is crippled as fuck

[09-Mar-19 09:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
If that works, I can plug the unity plugin into it with ease already made a package

[09-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cant focus on apt-get shit and missing stuff while doing madness

[09-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
because

[09-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I

[09-Mar-19 09:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL we should already have some windows builds for FSM  branch

[09-Mar-19 09:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@jl777c do we have binaries? if so, please share ðŸ˜®

[09-Mar-19 09:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions hows your shader foo?

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
51% attacks let you steal enemy resources

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions I wrote a multipass surface shader

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok no worries

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I'll do that crap

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain would know about location of builds, we need windows FSM

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] fmproductions#2904
yeah, I can try the windows builds today

[09-Mar-19 09:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions there are prob binaries

[09-Mar-19 09:34 AM] fmproductions#2904
yeah there are tools for cross compiling, like cygwin

[09-Mar-19 09:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
can you set up a default unreal project, basically with HDR, Linear coloring, PP, and look into plugin development, wrap me a good example, I can basically then port 6AM and the core plugin to connect with Komodod

[09-Mar-19 09:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry discord is lagging, my mem is overloaded

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
damn machines are too slow for my awesomeness

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions does unreal have an asset store?

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we probably need a stack of crazy

[09-Mar-19 09:36 AM] fmproductions#2904
yeah, they have the unreal marketplace

[09-Mar-19 09:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, definitely particle system for UI, LUT support, DOTween stuff, and AA text fonts like TextMeshPro

[09-Mar-19 09:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
make a shopping list, I'll buy them

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] fmproductions#2904
you mean the equivalents for unreal? I would have to look into it

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
never waste time on trivial crap

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ðŸ˜‰

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats why us use an engine

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Jeet Kun Do for gamedevs

[09-Mar-19 09:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mockups mockups

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no need for textures and geo

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I got all the stuff

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] fmproductions#2904
yeah, that is a good piece of advice ^^
for that demo we don't care about how fancy the UI is, so that is some optional stuff

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
dude

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
fancy is KEY

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
shit should look awesome

[09-Mar-19 09:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
when did I EVER made unfancy shit

[09-Mar-19 09:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 09:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
