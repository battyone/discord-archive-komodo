[07-Mar-19 02:34 PM] fmproductions#2904
maybe you should then 🙂

[07-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I need to buy us stuff first

[07-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
after that, I can rest

[07-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[07-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64  ping me when you are back awake please. I would like you to go over my article about the unity client and other game topics.  I *should* be done in a few hours....

[07-Mar-19 02:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptatometrader44 I'm gonna take a shower, eat something, sleep 4 hours max, stretch and get meds, so in 6+/- hours from now

[07-Mar-19 02:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you can just drop me a DM

[07-Mar-19 03:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@barv how many people are on that showcase again on tuesday?

[07-Mar-19 03:15 PM] barv#0867
This far 20 singed up. I expect ~ 30 to turn up

[07-Mar-19 03:16 PM] barv#0867
Last minute attendees minus no shows

[07-Mar-19 03:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and it was going to be about gamedev in general or komodo specifically?

[07-Mar-19 03:17 PM] barv#0867
'how blockchain will disrupt game dev'

[07-Mar-19 03:17 PM] barv#0867
can only be Komodo I think 😃

[07-Mar-19 03:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm looks like how gamedev is disrupting blockchain seems more like it xD

[07-Mar-19 03:18 PM] barv#0867
haha. true as well

[07-Mar-19 03:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, so no Loomers/Enjineers

[07-Mar-19 03:18 PM] barv#0867
Cool. We will address some other efforts like Loom as well.

[07-Mar-19 03:19 PM] barv#0867
I think basically old skool game devs who are new to blockchain

[07-Mar-19 03:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah, so not so much Komodo fanatics 😦

[07-Mar-19 03:20 PM] barv#0867
I bring my whole family @TwilightPunkster K64 ! And we're with 6 😃

[07-Mar-19 03:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[07-Mar-19 03:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh dear

[07-Mar-19 03:20 PM] barv#0867
I'll ask @Meyse with his kmdice showcase as well

[07-Mar-19 03:22 PM] barv#0867
And @bartwr will present with me of course. Komodo fan, but also general enthusiast for other innovative blockchain stuff

[07-Mar-19 03:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I see a bunch of Fintech faces and even someone from my old UtrechtJS group

[07-Mar-19 03:23 PM] Meyse#0952
i'll be there

I'll be there around 14:00 is my guess. Have a meeting in Rotterdam first

[07-Mar-19 03:39 PM] Meyse#0952

@Meyse - Was it you and your dice app that brought this wonderfully energetic fellow, @TwilightPunkster K64  into the fray?  He mentioned "A dice app on the blockchain" and it went from there.

[07-Mar-19 05:38 PM] Meyse#0952
@FishyGuts i think so, yes, showed him last week something from our upcoming project for KMDICE

[07-Mar-19 05:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Perfect example of why we ALL need to break out of our Bubbles. 
I spoke with @TwilightPunkster K64 for nearly 2 hours last night.  Very excited for what he brings to the table.

If anyone has skills taking code and writing a manual for an SDK, for this specifically, reach out please. 
Have a great day everyone, I only slept 2 hours last night and I need a nap 😛

[07-Mar-19 08:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts always energetic. Gonna have a swift break for 2 maybe 3 hours and get some stuff done. Also I got  with me some help @fmproductions to port the sdk to Unreal (and happens to proficient in Unity too). BBL

[07-Mar-19 09:27 PM] barv#0867
Yes @FishyGuts , in The Hague we organise a weekly blockchain co-work day and there happen to be Komodo lovers like @Meyse  every week ready to onboard anyone that walks in 😁

[07-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Meyse#0952
I shill the shit out of komodo everytime i get the chance 😄

that nap was way longer than intended 😂😂😂

[08-Mar-19 03:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@barv awesome slides - I'm a bit sceptic about the slides, but I am super biased of course as a game developer myself

[08-Mar-19 03:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just some points for the "future" when you are going to interact with game developers;

[08-Mar-19 03:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- don't use games as example that are from Rockstar; they are very hostile towards blockchain gaming and have been a driving force to hold back the industry in blockchain technology adoption. Ubisoft on the other hand, is something different :)
- usage of the Playstation console image is probably going to contradict, because technically speaking, Komodo would breach about five terms of service (there is a NDA regarding Playstation development so I can't be very specific), but if you read the public EULA, a real "ownership" of assets on the  console is not going to happen plus there is PSN that is required for distribution of games that would further limit the tech,

[08-Mar-19 03:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@barv Integration is probably covered with the RogueCC demo, but I'd probably would suggest a SWOT in blochchain development; the missing links for example.

[08-Mar-19 03:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just my two cents

@TwilightPunkster K64 just for the option, please let me know if Apple TV could be used as games testing at some point 😅

[08-Mar-19 05:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
whenever and whatever that might be 😁

[08-Mar-19 05:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder have never really testing gaming on Apple TV... However, I technically could test on any Samsung as I did some Multiscreen stuff, and I am pretty sure I could run Komodo on one xD  can you do some homework for me (I am currently compiling testing writing stuff), so can you check what specs AppleTV can do for any regular game? (like is it an iOS application)

[08-Mar-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Apple TV is arm64

[08-Mar-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so just like a mobile or iPad

[08-Mar-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, it's iOS varient

[08-Mar-19 05:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
On second thought it might not be good idea to run full blockchain on it.

[08-Mar-19 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
When we'll be able to make CC transactions via mobile, we would be able to use SPV servers

[08-Mar-19 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then it'd be good idea to think of arm devices

[08-Mar-19 06:03 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for feedback, especially with PSN/Rockstart stuff - we're blind to that side of the business of games.

[08-Mar-19 06:03 AM] Mylo#8306
*star

[08-Mar-19 06:04 AM] Mylo#8306
apple TV1 you would have had a chance, gentoo used to run on it.   not sure about current gen atv

[08-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes the CC (tx signing) via mobile (SPV/lite mode) will make the next iteration of blockchain gaming go stratospheric.   we are currently looking at the "CEX for games" atm.

[08-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Mylo#8306
via rest api.  or you run your blockchain with your game (or embed it into the game).

[08-Mar-19 06:07 AM] Mylo#8306
only my opinion.    but CEX works still for a lot of ppl that want instant gratification of trading....same for games no doubt.  as long as assets/value can be transferred out of the hosted gaming env to your own wallet - it works.  like "save game" you own.

[08-Mar-19 06:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder  that probably will give some issues with blockchain natively

[08-Mar-19 06:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
has there ever been made a browser POC of Komodo?

[08-Mar-19 07:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions most stuff done, got some extra support from the Komodo Team, we are gonna do this stuff on steroids

@fmproductions I made 6AM twice as fast and it basically can consume solidity sols now on the fly, and transpile them without solc

[08-Mar-19 07:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
honestly, I just inlined solc's low level

[08-Mar-19 07:40 AM] fmproductions#2904
is this an interpreted or compiled language? have never tried my own before, 
and do you use another interpreter or parser for it, or completely your own?
