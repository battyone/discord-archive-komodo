a dedicated chain per game should be enough. if not you can make a cluster of chains

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] fmproductions#2904
ah I see

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh @fmproductions meet the founder lead dev and prime rogue @jl777c

woah, hi there jl777c, should you read this ^^

[07-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It also gave a way for a betting platform and multiplayer for Rogue games. Players pay a fee, last player standing wins the pot.

just in case you feel to free

[07-Mar-19 01:10 PM] fmproductions#2904
sure xD 
I won't meme here

[07-Mar-19 01:10 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they can handle me so far, so you'll be fine

[07-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Another potential feature is a game studio making it so that the tokens (characters or items) could be swapped between games.

@fmproductions alrighty, I am probably have to clean out my crypto and get ourselves some vps boxes, linodes good for you or should we bang on something else?

[07-Mar-19 01:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist miles ahead of ya

[07-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So say something like taking your character from RPG 1 over to RPG 2

[07-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Of course. üòâ

[07-Mar-19 01:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have about 200Gb of game assets, and about 50K worth of assets I can use for games. Plus I made some nifty automation tools.

[07-Mar-19 01:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

@Cryptofist u have ybe grasp of cc games possibilities üòâ

second, we create a production ready, lean mean skyrim machine of 6AM that can beat the crap out of any Solidity contract and use the solc low level api to transpile Ethereum DApp like logic into Komodo stuff

[07-Mar-19 01:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically my strategy is to make this so good, that my 10 KMD is worth millions and I can buy a lambo.

btw, @fmproductions have you ever seen a bot like this

[07-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@grewalsatinder  Thank you! I am very excited about all the possibilities.

[07-Mar-19 01:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

@TwilightPunkster K64 (TwilightPunkster#7533)
You tipped @fmproductions **5 KMD**

[07-Mar-19 01:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
^^ they have a money bot

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
!arrrtip @fmproductions  10.0001

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] fmproductions#2904
woah, this is related to the discord user though, how would you process that. 
interesting indeed!

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
we have several.

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] ARRR TipBot#1743

TipBot
@Cryptofist (Cryptofist#7504)
You tipped @fmproductions **10 ARRR**
A network fee of 0.0001 ARRR was deducted from the amount.
This operation is pending. You will be notified when when it has finished.

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions you basically have a wallet and you now have KMD (around 0.8 euro or so)

[07-Mar-19 01:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
... I am speechless

[07-Mar-19 01:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions they have money bots.

[07-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So, you can also make a discord bot like these that can exchange tokens, currency and interact with the game, blockchain and social site.

dude

[07-Mar-19 01:18 PM] fmproductions#2904
and the walled transactions are so fast?

[07-Mar-19 01:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions how many bots do I have like in one script?

[07-Mar-19 01:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So your discord  CAN BE your game marketplace.

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
none of my bots tip monies though, but maybe in the future

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@fmproductions  Most are, yes.

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] fmproductions#2904
true!

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
anyway, thats a cool feature and all, but basically we are doing this for a better world

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] fmproductions#2904
I have seen a lot of discord bots, with neat features, but never in a combination like that

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I figure the token exchanging would be fun for game items.

[07-Mar-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Great for promotions,  Join discord and receive an item pack.

[07-Mar-19 01:20 PM] fmproductions#2904
just a short while ago I was adding a little feature to a music player bot, which essentially lists you the last x tracks it played with some detail information

[07-Mar-19 01:20 PM] fmproductions#2904
but that is about it

[07-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I believe there are quite a few open source bots in the blockchain space that can be used to extract ideas from. The tip bots we have here all come from one person with private code.

[07-Mar-19 01:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
anyway, we'll work this thing out. Probably best if we stick our nerd talk here and whoever is interested can well follow stuff @fmproductions

[07-Mar-19 01:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe along the way @jl777c might have a suggestion or two

[07-Mar-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
without game events validation, how will it be ensured to avoid fake items?

[07-Mar-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
seems the issuance of new item needs to be strictly controlled

[07-Mar-19 01:29 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup, but for that I got something special üòõ

[07-Mar-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be a key part of the SDK

[07-Mar-19 01:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
do I hear a spec üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
part of the black box

[07-Mar-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
as without it, things dont really work right

[07-Mar-19 01:31 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, I was going to make a full spec since there wasn't any, but it is part of my plan (I just have an other name for it)

[07-Mar-19 01:32 PM] fmproductions#2904
Thank you for the gracious tip! appreciate it. May I ask where the tokens come from? does there need to be a wallet connection for those who tip for the bot?

[07-Mar-19 01:32 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions basically, all those questions will make sense after the initial setup. I'll write everything down somewhere tonight

[07-Mar-19 01:33 PM] fmproductions#2904
alright!

[07-Mar-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
the tipbot is a centralized thing, you interact with it in the special channel

[07-Mar-19 01:33 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
certain parts are so easy, but all the jargon will make you search for days

[07-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@jl777c I only used it for demonstration purposes, I was shocked to see it, so I wanted to prepare my friend here for such things.

[07-Mar-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
for the dilithium CC, i implemented unique handles. so you register a handle with your pubkey (and dilithium bigpubkey)

[07-Mar-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
after that it would be possible for gui to "send" to a handle, which underneath is converted to the registration txid

‚ù§ 

[07-Mar-19 01:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions what testing strategy do you prefer? UT/E2E or some sexy TDD/BDD?

[07-Mar-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and the validation uses the registration txid to obtain the pubkey to use

[07-Mar-19 01:37 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions the CC usage refer to the smart contract modules, which are Crypto Conditions

[07-Mar-19 01:37 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
<< also the chans are about that

[07-Mar-19 01:39 PM] fmproductions#2904
TDD BDD usually where I have worked, but the tests can come after the initial prototype is done.

[07-Mar-19 01:39 PM] fmproductions#2904
also thanks for the bot info

[07-Mar-19 01:40 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions there is a lot, also, we are going to need a specific branch of Komodo to do certain stuff

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07-Mar-19 01:40 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and I have to buy some stuff for us

[07-Mar-19 01:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
afaik there aren't some quick fire it up instance thingies, but you know how I like to make life easy

[07-Mar-19 01:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions btw, how about a brawler demo for Unreal?

[07-Mar-19 01:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
like Tekken 7 rewards?

[07-Mar-19 01:44 PM] fmproductions#2904
now, this would be interesting

[07-Mar-19 01:44 PM] fmproductions#2904
not sure yet, but let's talk about that too ofc

[07-Mar-19 01:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I'm thinking lootbox-like reward

[07-Mar-19 01:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
fight for the price

[07-Mar-19 01:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I got all combat animations mocapped from twilight punkster

[07-Mar-19 01:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

Fury moves in Twilight Punkster are chained combos that can grow up to 13 levels and become more powerful as your character increases in stats. #gamedev #indiedev #IndieGameDev #madewithunity #pc #rpg #gamejolt https://t.co/FuR1YTnlzF

I think that might work!

[07-Mar-19 01:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
another possible one is to use the isometric one, that never made it

Example is the dragon punch - applying the "the bigger they are...", where the distance to ground (up to 3 meters) adds extra damage.

Of course, even when enemies are to smart, you can still outsmart them with secondary attacks - which cast effects like "stunned"

is there an IK / Mecanim like solution that maps well in Unreal? @fmproductions

@Mylo do you mean that positive or negative in rant?
