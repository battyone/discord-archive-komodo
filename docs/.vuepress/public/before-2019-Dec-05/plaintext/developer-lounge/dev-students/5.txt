adding something like "data":"hexstring" adds an opreturn, i forget the details

[02-Nov-18 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
use google

@kimmel (Pungo.io) what is it you're trying to do?

[02-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
KV and oracles simplify using OP_RETURN *a lot*

[02-Nov-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That depsnds what you want to do with it

[02-Nov-18 04:40 PM] Alright#0419
can simplify* 😛

I was trying to generate invalid addresses for coin burn

[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
Ah, it's not exactly an invalid address

[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
rather no address

[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] Alright#0419
an OP_RETURN burn that is

[02-Nov-18 04:49 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes I know. alternatively I read that I can generate a "valid" address from an invalid pubkey

[02-Nov-18 04:50 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but I haven't found yet a way generate an address from pubkey in komodo

[02-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
can show you how to do it in python if you like

[02-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
I think best bet for burning is OP_RETURN

[02-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
wouldn't bother playing around trying to generate addresses with invalid keys

[02-Nov-18 04:59 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so using KV or oracles as you commented?

[02-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
No, sorry you'd want to use KV or oracles if you were storing data via OP_RETURN

[02-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
there must be some scripts written to generate the proper input for createrawtransaction or for generating the raw tx itself

[02-Nov-18 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
we will need to do this for STAKED, so I will look into how to do

[02-Nov-18 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats the burn address

[02-Nov-18 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you enter a null pubkey into komododit generates that

[02-Nov-18 05:03 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
komododit?

hey guys, using https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install, any idea what I should set the nginx root directory to? It didn't seem to create any `/home/user/insight` folder or any `insight` folder for that matter.

[02-Nov-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
RRmWExvapDM9YbLT9X9xAyzDgxomYf63ng is not the burn address i know

[02-Nov-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPVMY <- that is the one from null pubkey

[02-Nov-18 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
I wasn't able to verify that the WIF posted along with RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPVMY (Up1YVLk7uuErCHVQyFCtfinZngmdwfyfc47WCQ8oJxgowEbuo6t4) actually corresponds to the address

[02-Nov-18 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
I tried importing it after removing a couple checks in the daemon, and it showed a different address

[02-Nov-18 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
obviously the daemon won't work as expected after removing vital checks, but I'm not sure how else to verify it

[02-Nov-18 07:57 PM] Alright#0419
It had very weird behavior. For example, mining blocks to it's pubkey sent coins to an entirely different address

I would recommend burning coins via OP_RETURN as generating invalid keys can be tricky business

[02-Nov-18 08:01 PM] Alright#0419
much easier for someone to verify it's burned

[02-Nov-18 08:51 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok still need to sort out how to make OP_RETURN handable with an script or something similar

[03-Nov-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright in theory, private key = `0` is not valid, smallest valid private key is `1`, since private key must be positive number I believe

[03-Nov-18 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
somethings might choke on private key=0 for that reason

[04-Nov-18 07:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275

it seems to not have transactions?

[05-Nov-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
creating a new CC would allow a real working blockchain without having to recreate all the blockchain code

I am still to implement transactions, and also networking support

[05-Nov-18 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a good way to learn, but realstically to make a fully working blockchain is years of coding

In that order the command run fine (no error) but no data is written in op_return

@metaphilibert KMD `createrawtransaction` needs to learn how to use `data` key then

[23-Nov-18 10:34 AM] lorrrris#8439
Hi everyone!
I'm trying to understand UTXO based contracts and its relation to crypto-conditions.
I can see how contracts are added to komodo and how their API can be called via RPC. What I don't understand is what's happening under the hood. How are the contracts related to the IETF draft on crypto conditions (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04) and the libraries implementing it (e.g. https://github.com/libscott/libcryptoconditions)? I guess it's somehow via `OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION` but don't understand how... I'd be very thankful if someone could point me to a good explanation or shed some light into the dark.

[23-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
CC includes that as a subset, but it adds a lot of other things on top. the vout script is the serialized cryptoconditions hash

[23-Nov-18 03:14 PM] lorrrris#8439
Ok I think I now understand a bit more.
The key thing used of crypto-conditions is that using its condition/fullfillment scheme, anyone providing a correct fulfillment (opposed to a normal signature, like in standard payments)  can spend this output, right? This fulfillment is then already included in the transactions generated by e.g. `faucetGet()`. And for validation, whether to include a Tx in the blockchain, only the per contract specified validation functions are relevant.

[23-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
all of the bitcoin rules, cryptocondition rules and the CC custom rules need to be passed

[23-Nov-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the cryptoconditions signature needs to be a valid fulfillment, but it is based on bitcoin utxo that are valid

[23-Nov-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and the final step is for the specific CC to return true, ie. that it is valid according to its rules. since arbitrary code can be in a CC, an arbitrary set of rules can be implemented

[25-Nov-18 02:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I think @dukeleto  should run a crypto camp for students ...qualified students - 2k per student max 30 students for 2-3 weeks. - tents, food and camping gear not included.. just another krazy idea

[25-Nov-18 03:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
even up it to 3k per student

[25-Nov-18 03:02 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
or morrrr

[25-Nov-18 03:12 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
maybe KMD camps accross the globe, Austrailia @blackjok3r , New Zealand @grewalsatinder  or even Puerto Rico @siu - Chainmakers

Yes, komodo team thinks of this type of things, that is why there are dev side work being done. Before workshops and training camps, the resources are being made for devs. Once we have good enough resources then training efforts can be started.
