python has it's own place in coding.
the best performance is expected from native/core programs, the ones compiles to binary, and that's mostly possible with core languages which are more efficient for this purpose than python.
python fits best for system admin stuff, and clients level code. so a client apps connecting to native code makes sense.

[08-May-19 12:24 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so python would be used more for the front end development

[08-May-19 12:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
command line too, for backend of some blockchain apps, but not to build the core blockchain daemon itself

I had a little concern about the actual situation with agama:
If using the wif of a ledger walllet address to claim rewards. 
Isnt it compromising your 24 word seed phrase? Since the privkeys(WIF) are derived from it and we get it using a bip39 tool. 
Its not possible to do this process in reverced? Find seed phrase from a WIF

[05-Jun-19 06:58 PM] gcharang#6833
only that wif is compromised @27aume the rest are fine
I will advise to create a new ledger seed and send all your ledger funds to it

@27aume a seed phrase generates large numbers of WIFs, because a seed phrase represents a wallet. A WIF represents a single address. There is no way to go from information about a single address back to the seed phrase. Hope that helps explain a bit.

@Ashwh to write a new CC, i.e. a new kind of smart contract, currently you must add C/C++ code. Once you have that type of contract, then it's just RPC calls to create/manage those kinds of contracts. We want this to be easier and more accessible

[10-Jun-19 11:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
if your needs fit a current CC, you don't need to do custom C/C++ development, just use existing RPCs

[10-Jun-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
so in my understanding end-goal task might be separated on subtasks something like a: understand what CCs are, understand current implementation on C, think about best implementation way and design on Go, implement and add to current komodod compilation process

[10-Jun-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
not sure if my understanding is correct for sure

[11-Jun-19 12:05 AM] ashwin#5867
@TonyL and @dukeleto is there a library in python or any other language that eases the development of CC in that particular language? Other than c/c++

[11-Jun-19 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No, its a petty large task to create all the needed links and helper functions to add a new language. I looked into lua, which seems useful, as u can create code by only restarting daemon rather than rebuilding it, but as things are still evolving at a low level, adding this new seems a massive waste of time. Just learn c++, its really not that hard.

[11-Jun-19 10:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ashwin what exactly is your goal? I agree with blackjoker, in that pretty much whatever your goal is, doing it with C/C++ will probably be less work than trying to make it work in Go/etc. Potentially 10X or 100X less work

[11-Jun-19 10:54 AM] dukeleto#7326

[11-Jun-19 02:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto @blackjok3r here's the context if it got mixed up in the conversations:
- @ashwin made KMD client API package in go.
- Asked if there's anything else he can help Komodo project with any other dev work with his skills
- James asked if he can make a linkable library for Crypto-Conditions in Go language.

The intent is not the have a Go package doing RPC API calls to the CC made in C/C++ in `komodod`, the intent is to make the Go language devs possible to create a CC in Go language, which can be compiled to a library file to link to the komodod code, and used easily.

It is to extend the CC coding devbase to the other languages like Go language.

It might be big task, it I won't say anything to move away from this task to @ashwin 
Instead I highly encourage him to Go for it. Get help from your teachers/professors and from the devs here to understand what is going on under the hood in Komodo code and try to bridge it to Go language dev community.

[11-Jun-19 02:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are 2 things first I'd like to see:
- Calling the C functions from Go code and using them to make further application. It is indeed possible, since Go very much like Rust is friendly to work with C/C++. I am on/off work to move on my Go coding these days, some personal reasons, so just things are slow from my end. I'd love to see this basic thing work as code example. The target for @ashwin can be to us Go language to call Crypto-Conditions specific methods/classes/functions from C/C++ code inside `komodod`. Use that to encrypt/decrypt transaction. I'm still weak in my C/C++ skills, so can't assist much, there are more devs here who can help @ashwin üôÇ 

- The second task would be to make the functions/struct/methods/interfaces etc which are importable/callable in C/C++ code so that even if it makes it possible to  code the half or even the little partial part of the Crypto-Conditions logic in Go language it at least displays what is possible and set some example for others to extend that solution further in the language they understand better. For that I'd suggest @ashwin to take a look at the "faucet" C code in FSM branch of jl777/komodo repo on GitHub.

[11-Jun-19 02:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ashwin I hope this helps clearer what is expected?

[11-Jun-19 02:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ashwin I have also made a KMD Go package sometime ago. It has some more automated things like not requiring RPC info from coder and just gets those from the .conf file automatically, and it is extend to be useable by any ecosystem smart chains in KMD ecosystem.

@ashwin I see yours is doing things simple, and clear. I see you also had started making structs for the output values from RPC clients. 
I'd highly suggest you to sync the full node of KMD locally, and just do test each single API with your client package and then make another example go code to display the results in somewhat meaningful way, even just a printf would be fine.

[11-Jun-19 02:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not entirely sure at level of skillets you are at with Go, so you can explore things further. I guess you have good help from your teachers, and they can help you there. I just learned much of the Go from online tutorials and moving slow with my learning and coding these days.

[11-Jun-19 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder @ashwin i guess creating and parsing raw transactions in Go would be useful, i don't think anything does that yet

[11-Jun-19 02:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is crypto-conditions go packages as well as I last checked, and since the Komodo code uses C CC code, there are other libs/methods used in it as well.
since C/C++ is still my weaker point I could not go through Komodo code to identify where I need to call things from and what I would need to do which can make me possible to make Go language based CC code.

[11-Jun-19 02:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do believe it must be possible to entirely make a CC dynamic lib in just  Go language, but for that for now I just understand that one has to understand both C/C++ code and Go code, and then initiate the CC work in Go.

[11-Jun-19 02:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once the example is there, it'll be much helpful for others to follow.

[11-Jun-19 02:53 PM] ashwin#5867
Ok. @grewalsatinder if I got you right. I will need to make a library in golang that will enable developers to create CC. This can be achieved by CGO feature and linking the Komodo dynamic C library to golang library code. Yes C code can be linked directly to Golang code but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend C++. Ive has 5 months of internship experience at Tesla doing this. Ive been writing distributed systems and golang wrappers for C code.
