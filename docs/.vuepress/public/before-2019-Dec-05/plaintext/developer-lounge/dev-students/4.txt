gonna walk away and see if it starts finding vouts or whatever

[23-Oct-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it needs a connection before it will mine üòâ

[23-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
hum?

[23-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181

[23-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
back later xD im having a break regardless..

[23-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
i think i know what im doing wrong still

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
a third? ive not read anything about a third node been required

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no only 1

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but your getinfo you posted show 0 connections

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cannot mine with no connection

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you disable that in the code

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
yeah ive not sync kmd even

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont eneed KMD synced

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need your 2 nodes to connect to each other

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ok.. so what connection here am i missing?

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
yeahp

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
got that

[23-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
well.. thought i did

[23-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
ive stopped both the daemons now.. ill check

[23-Oct-18 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could be a firewall ... or something could have happened...

[23-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
on both nodes

[23-Oct-18 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then restart ... this has happened to be a few times last few days, but I am messing with consensus things, should not normall happen. make sure the ports are open

[23-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
:34935 that would be I assume

[23-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
so with AWS.. ports... thats done in the security groups area correct?

initial supply of 100 is nothing though üòÑ

[23-Oct-18 01:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
77 billion something is the max

[23-Oct-18 01:53 PM] gcharang#6833
Whichever node mines the first block gets the supply in its wallet if you don't start the daemon with a pubkey.

If you are working on changing emission schedules, VRSC has already extended komodo's paramaters for a more complicated emission schedule, those parameters will be available through Komodo in the future. Till then Verus' code base might be helpful to you

[01-Nov-18 05:32 PM] beybietron#2493
hey guys, i'm confused about the `ac_pubkey`  option when creating an asset chain? Where do you actually get a public key when the chain hasn't been started?

[01-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jorian#4555
any of the other chains

[01-Nov-18 05:35 PM] jorian#4555
```./komodo-cli getnewaddress
./komodo-cli validateaddress <address here>``` will show a pubkey for that new address

[01-Nov-18 05:36 PM] jorian#4555
and since you can do `./komodo-cli dumpprivkey` you can import it in the new chain

[01-Nov-18 05:37 PM] beybietron#2493
well since komod hasn't been started yet (I'm creating an asset chain), komodo-cli doesn't work

[01-Nov-18 05:37 PM] beybietron#2493
I guess I should just started komod first and sync with komodo blockchain first?

[01-Nov-18 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[01-Nov-18 05:38 PM] jorian#4555
you don't have to sync it completely

[01-Nov-18 05:39 PM] beybietron#2493
I presume I can't just generate any 33 byte hex string as the pubkey, it has to be generated by komodo-cli?

[01-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jorian#4555
there are plenty of generators around

[01-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jorian#4555
same math

[01-Nov-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
any valid keypair is a valid keypair

[01-Nov-18 05:42 PM] beybietron#2493
Ah I see, I thought there are restrictions, like the first character of the address should be a specific character like other coins

[01-Nov-18 05:42 PM] beybietron#2493
Ah I see, I thought there are restrictions, like the first character of the address should be a specific character like other coins

[01-Nov-18 05:44 PM] jorian#4555
a pubkey doesn't have that yet

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
address is the one with prefix

[01-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
base58.(prefix + rmd160(sha256(pubkey)))

[01-Nov-18 05:46 PM] beybietron#2493
I see, thanks for the explanation

[01-Nov-18 09:24 PM] beybietron#2493
one more thing, if I cannot new nodes to the assetchain, do they always have to have the same -ac parameters as the original 2 seed nodes?

[02-Nov-18 01:26 AM] gcharang#6833
Once the chain is greater than approx 120 blocks, you can add other nodes to the network using the same parameters as the first two nodes. the `-seednode` can be any of the first two nodes, it just needs to continously be online

[02-Nov-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
different ac parameters refer to a different chain

[02-Nov-18 01:31 PM] beybietron#2493
thanks. what's the easiest way I can make an explorer for my test chain? I see there is something in the guides but it seems to be an explorer for all existing assetchains.

[02-Nov-18 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Use that, star the chain

[02-Nov-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then edit the install-explorers.sh

[02-Nov-18 01:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the array of asserchains contains your test chains name

[02-Nov-18 01:40 PM] beybietron#2493
does it only need the names of the test chains?

[02-Nov-18 01:40 PM] beybietron#2493
looks like I can just add it in `kmd_coins.sh` but I don't know I've never used this

[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes thats how you do it

[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
remove all the ones you dont want

[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the way I did it was just start the chain manually on command line

[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then run install-exploers.sh

[02-Nov-18 01:45 PM] beybietron#2493

hey, ideas on how to use OP_RETURN  to build a tx in komodo cli?

[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
createrawtransaction should allow you to specify "data" for opreturn, but you need to search for details

[02-Nov-18 04:20 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
like this one https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/komodo-API.html#createrawtransaction-txid-id-vout-n-address-amount

[02-Nov-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
search for createrawtransaction opreturn
