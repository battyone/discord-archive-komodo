[30-Jun-19 08:06 PM] dante#7122
it says rpc.8405

[30-Jun-19 08:07 PM] dante#7122
also if i try with the komodo-cli getinfo it shows the same

[30-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just to clarify - is it komodod or FRESHCHAIN that is giving rpc of 8405?

[30-Jun-19 08:18 PM] TonyL#3577
@dante please note that RPC params for `FRESHCHAIN`  you need to set in `~/.komodo/FRESHCHAIN/komodo.conf` (not in `~/.komodo/komodo.conf`)
maybe it's a clue

[30-Jun-19 08:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
That may be ``~/.komodo/FRESHCHAIN/FRESHCHAIN.conf``

[30-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Oszy#5734
i tried what he';s using and it  works for me so it's a configuration problem

[30-Jun-19 08:21 PM] Oszy#5734
I used ChainName.conf as well

[30-Jun-19 08:22 PM] TonyL#3577
`That may be ~/.komodo/FRESHCHAIN.conf` nope, for assetchains blocks, config and etc automatically creating separate folders `%acname%` in `~/.komodo`

[30-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Sorry - edited - but it should be ChainName.conf

[30-Jun-19 09:03 PM] dante#7122
@TonyL  Finally, not refering to  FRESHCHAIN.conf  was my mistake

[30-Jun-19 09:03 PM] dante#7122
thankyou !

[30-Jun-19 09:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Glad to help!

for 77 reward you need to put 7700000000

[01-Jul-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
you are complaining about 7% deviation after 18 blocks??

[01-Jul-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it takes hundreds of blocks to reach the PoS target and in some cases it wont ever reach it, depends on hashrate, utxos, etc.

[01-Jul-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the first 100 blocks PoW is active

[01-Jul-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
things will be very unstable the first 100 blocks

[01-Jul-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you have coins in all segids?

[01-Jul-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
remove the word "staking" from that line

[01-Jul-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
```Use the getbalance64 method to ensure that there are coins in all 64 segids before block 10.```

[01-Jul-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a typo in the documentation

[01-Jul-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
utxo needs to have X number of confirmations before it can stake

[01-Jul-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure why it isnt documented better...

second bullet point

[01-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Alright#0419
staking vs notstaking in `getbalance64` is exactly what it sounds like

[01-Jul-19 08:47 PM] Alright#0419
eligible to stake vs not eligible to stake

[01-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
that number is garbage until block >100

[01-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
just meaningless garbage

[01-Jul-19 08:48 PM] Alright#0419
because it will tell you if you have eligible utxos or not

[01-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Alright#0419
I have a script that will do everything for you

[01-Jul-19 08:49 PM] Alright#0419
wrote it for exactly this kind of situation, it's hard to explain

[01-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
at block 10, it only takes 30 seconds for them to go from ineligible to eligible

[01-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what problem you're having

[01-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Alright#0419
it takes 30 seconds then a block*

[01-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
What is it you're trying to do?

[01-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
and what problem are you facing while doing it?

[01-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Alright#0419
ok if it stalled and there are no eligible utxos on the chain, you must restart it

[01-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
or invalidate a bunch of blocks and distribute after that

[01-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
you have no eligible utxos

[01-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Alright#0419
instead of "staking" it should say "eligible to stake" or something like this

[01-Jul-19 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
getbalance64 is likely garbage prior to block 2000, not sure would have to check out the code

[01-Jul-19 08:55 PM] Alright#0419
I didn't add that to the docs ðŸ˜›

[01-Jul-19 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
I figured it was much easier for me to script it all then say "hey, use these scripts" than detailing every single little nook and cranny of it

[01-Jul-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
realistically, people are not creating ac_staked chains constantly, you really need some experience to understand how to create them

[01-Jul-19 09:02 PM] Alright#0419
so I just used my experience to create a script

[01-Jul-19 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
Look, I didn't add that to the docs ðŸ˜«

[01-Jul-19 09:03 PM] Alright#0419
people add things without testing them all the time, this is why I've shied away from writing them

[01-Jul-19 09:04 PM] Alright#0419
I typically write everything in as much detail as possible then hand it over to @gcharang and @Bryan_Beus to do what they like with

[01-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I am summoned... how may I help?

[01-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
could you remove that line about getbalance64? ðŸ˜‚

[01-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Alright#0419
or explain what emman has said above

[01-Jul-19 09:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
help fill me in on what's going on...

[01-Jul-19 09:06 PM] Alright#0419
it won't work properly until block 100 or block 2000, not sure which, would have to test it

[01-Jul-19 09:06 PM] Alright#0419
easier to just remove it IMO, as it's not necessary to check that if you followed the rest of the doc

[01-Jul-19 09:07 PM] Alright#0419
`Use the getbalance64 method to ensure that there are coins in all 64 segids before block 10 (it doesn't matter on which list the utxos appear, "staking" or "notstaking").` this, sidd

what emman said is fine I guess, it's true, it won't matter if it shows it as staking or nonstaking as they will become eligible very quickly

[01-Jul-19 09:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
dm'ing you

[01-Jul-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
please use the "start a new chain" option in pos64staker for now

[01-Jul-19 09:13 PM] Alright#0419
will get the getbalance64 thing in the docs fixed

[01-Jul-19 09:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Does this solve your concern?

```
Use the getbalance64 method to ensure that there are coins in all 64 segids before block 10. The utxos may appear on any list, including both staking and nonstaking.
```

[01-Jul-19 09:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
?

[01-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, great. Thank you.

[01-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Fixing now.

It will go live with the rebrand update.

[01-Jul-19 09:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Was there something else that I can add, regarding block 105?

[01-Jul-19 09:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, lmk if so. Thanks!

[20-Aug-19 08:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I did that...

[20-Aug-19 08:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But its sitting in its own branch... waiting on @miketout  to get back to me.

[20-Aug-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810

its all there

[20-Aug-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
like for dilithium, it needs 4kb of data, which wont fit into a vout script, at least i dont think it will so easily

[20-Aug-19 08:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can make it fit, but im not sure of the concequences of making that data container very large... asit resides in all address index and everything

[20-Aug-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
finalizeCCtx is not consensus side code to sign the tx, but validation code will need to be changed to handle vout extra data

[20-Aug-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
a data item in the scripts are limited to 576 bytes

[20-Aug-19 08:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That token snapshot branch has some very nice examples on how to use it.. that was a lot of work

[20-Aug-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Aug-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
also, some functions might affect consensus in some contexts and not in other

Im trying to install the komodo chain on my own server, to play with it
