yes, the end goal is to make a Go language code which works the same way as the `faucet` CC code works in C language.

[11-Jun-19 02:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are 2 types of CC code examples in FSM branch of jl777/komodo repo.

[11-Jun-19 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. The CC code written in C, which is compiled with the `komodod` and is available from within of `komodod`.
2. Same like 1, written in C, but compiles to an independent dynamic library, which sites right next to the `komodod` binary and is the `komodod` calls the RPC/API/methods from this library. It is the dynamic CC creation method, which doesn't need recompiling the whole `komodod` and only the CC code part. Makes the devs' life much better to only care about the CC code and also helps distribution of the CC to end users in updates when/if needed.

[11-Jun-19 03:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
You should check both examples of this inside compiled komodod CC code, and the dynamic linkable CC code which compiles to library file.

[11-Jun-19 03:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
What James asked is the 2nd option.

[11-Jun-19 03:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just understand the 2nd way, dynamically linkable CC code lib, and try to make that in Go language üôÇ

[11-Jun-19 03:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c can probably point where to look for it.

[11-Jun-19 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are 2 ways to do it, you can crete wrappers for the functions you need to call, or you can try to rewrite all of them in Go.

[11-Jun-19 03:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ashwin nice to hear a Tesla intern ended up here in Komodo community üòâ

for the signing of transactions, there is actually a new way that cuirrently isnt used, that allows to sign the tx with existing wallet code.

[11-Jun-19 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will be experimenting with this in comming weeks after the fork is done. Maybe it will be of some help.

[11-Jun-19 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
catntell you how to use it, but I can show you where it is.

here. It requires to use the ccopt params, which places basically an op_return on the end of the cccvout itself. Then it needs the pubkeys in there, itlooks like it will see if the pubkey is in the wallet then sign the tx with that.

this should remove the need for FinaliseCCtx and all those extra steps, for some cases. I dont hink it automatically works with all existing CCs

[11-Jun-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because it cant know the eval code if the opt params dfont exist, so it has no key to sign with

[11-Jun-19 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are a bunch of changes in Verus using this, I tried to port them over  but failed. I think it doesnt amtter though because that stuff is backwards compatible

[12-Jun-19 10:13 PM] ashwin#5867
I just downloaded the source code. I'm getting include path errors. Is that expected? `/Users/ashwin/Documents/komodo/src/cryptoconditions/include/cryptoconditions.h:1:10: fatal error: 'cJSON.h' file not found

I'm using macOS Mojave. When I use `brew link boost` I get an error `Linking /usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.70.0... 
Error: Could not symlink include/boost

[13-Jun-19 04:11 PM] ashwin#5867
Does anybody face this same problem

[14-Jun-19 06:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ashwin sounds like configuring problems in your homebrew. I am not sure that `chown` of /usr/local/include is what you want

[14-Jun-19 06:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ashwin try `brew doctor`

[14-Jun-19 06:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
it detects and warns you of problems in your setup

[14-Jun-19 02:29 PM] ashwin#5867
@dukeleto brew doctor detects and warns errors. That is where I got the suggestion to ‚Äòbrew link‚Äô

@ashwin also, I think you can still compile `komodod` on your Mac without installing boost with brew.

[14-Jun-19 06:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it compiled without any issues

[15-Jun-19 02:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
right, komodo always compiles it's own version of boost, regardless of what is on your system

[15-Jun-19 02:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder maybe we should remove boost-dev from apt-get/mac install docs, if that is the case

[18-Jun-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on initial supply and mining rewareds, the PoS vs PoW doesnt change inflation rate

[18-Jun-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
a fixed percentage is actually quite difficult to achieve, unless it is 0%

maybe using eras you can keep it relatively close for the initial years

rpcallowip should be your lan ip  if i recall correctly

[30-Jun-19 04:34 PM] dante#7122
ok let me try that

[30-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Oszy#5734
rpcallowip is only needed in special situations where one wants to allow the client/daemon to accept RPC connections outside the localhost

[30-Jun-19 04:41 PM] dante#7122
@Oszy should rpcbind be my LAN ip?

[30-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Oszy#5734
