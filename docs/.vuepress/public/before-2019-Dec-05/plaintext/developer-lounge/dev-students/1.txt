For KMD students :)

We are in a partnership with a texas university.

CS faculty? Or economics? interesting

We have signed a partnership with the university and are welcoming a CS professor  to the team as an advisor to help lead the program.

We're working on a joint press release with the school, and will share with the community and public when it becomes available.

don't worry @33K blueprints ready - we have a lot of content in a lot of places and creating a "Komodoshi's Learning Centre" is one of the goals to complete.  What industries/demographics/skill-level etc. do you have or what exactly are you looking for in an education?  High level potential use cases?

hello

[20-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hi

[20-Aug-18 08:03 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
anyone learning C?

[20-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Hermes#6934
I am trying to lear C++

[20-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Hermes#6934
using some cool youtube tutorials

[20-Aug-18 11:13 PM] Jonathan#3687
C++ is fun, C# is a little easier - don't have to worry about memory management

[21-Aug-18 12:45 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
this old timer coder i met tells me C is the language to rule them all and once your learn C  and its ins and out, you will be a top coder, he stands by use of memory management and pointers

[21-Aug-18 12:46 AM] Jonathan#3687
each data structure has it's uses, vectors were my favorite but not so good for memory

[21-Aug-18 12:58 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
what would be the benefit for using C , over C# , or even C++ ?

[21-Aug-18 01:01 AM] Jonathan#3687
Have to defer to others on that one, never used C

[21-Aug-18 01:26 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
@Jonathan what languages do you program in ?

[21-Aug-18 01:33 AM] Jonathan#3687
I know C++, some C#, Javascript, SQL, PL-SQL mainly. Skimmed over others

[21-Aug-18 01:36 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736

most all the other languages derive from C, or have their compilers written in C

[21-Aug-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
to write system software, you need the control C gives you

[21-Aug-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
C++ masks using  pointers, but it is using them, you are just shielded from it and prevented from directly debugging

[21-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
also C++ makes you rely on all these standard classes and will take 10x longer to get to where you can do things properly

And if you really want to understand what a C compiler does, learn assembly

[21-Aug-18 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wrote this intro to coding in assembly with NASM just about 18 years ago, when I was supposed to be learning C in my college classes: http://leto.net/writing/nasm.php

[21-Aug-18 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, some of my classmates were dinosaurs and cavemen. It was a long time ago.

[21-Aug-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the best way is to write a C compiler!

[21-Aug-18 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
in C

[21-Aug-18 03:42 PM] Hermes#6934
Understood ok I will try seeing C shortly also , maybe I can get to know why somethings in C++ work in certain way

[21-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Hermes#6934
The thing about this videos is that I can memorize and pretty much do the same code that they put me from scratch

[21-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Hermes#6934
but to see a constant use doing your own programs and practicing yourself with things that entertain you  day to day is what makes it even more fun. and actually easy to learn. If you loose practice because you don't see an end to learning you can get rusty...I think most people go C++ for video games

[21-Aug-18 03:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c where to start from? any book recommendation ?

[21-Aug-18 03:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for C

[21-Aug-18 03:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I chose C++ as part of the CC smart contract has to go to komodod, which is C++ mainly.

[21-Aug-18 03:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I'd still majorly focus on Go language.

[21-Aug-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
The CC contracts code I am writing is 90% C

[21-Aug-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810

what is the best  language to learn for blockchain dev

[21-Aug-18 04:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
modren devs are leaning towards golang and rust

[21-Aug-18 04:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but code so far has been dominated by C/C++ I think for existing projects

[21-Aug-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
C

[21-Aug-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
I seem to have done ok with C

[21-Aug-18 04:04 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736

[21-Aug-18 04:06 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
so there is go , rust, c , and c++

[21-Aug-18 04:06 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
two super old lower level, and two new high level

[21-Aug-18 04:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, so I'll instead chose to focus on C and Golang instead of C++ an Golang now.

[21-Aug-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the only thing hard about C is pointers

[21-Aug-18 04:08 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
i hear C is easier then c++
