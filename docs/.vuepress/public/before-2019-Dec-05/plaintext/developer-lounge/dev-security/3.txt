not even sure 2 hrs is enough time to look at the PoS code, much less the code from a security aspect

[30-Mar-19 02:06 PM] yope#8519
Absolutely right

[30-Mar-19 02:06 PM] yope#8519
That's why I say I am far from convinced.

[30-Mar-19 02:07 PM] yope#8519
I don't think Komodo has had enough scrutiny and attack by a big margin to say anything about the security.

[30-Mar-19 02:08 PM] yope#8519
You mean the EMC2 attack?

[30-Mar-19 02:09 PM] yope#8519
There are contradicting stories about that, so I don't know who to believe...

[30-Mar-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I can think of 5 things that were done just because of an attack theory and with any due respect, the EMC2 "attack" was laughable

[30-Mar-19 02:11 PM] yope#8519
Ok, but it depends on how you look at that... if you see a trend there of "successful attack --> fixed", then we can expect more successful attacks, right 😉

[30-Mar-19 02:14 PM] yope#8519
Thanks a lot for helping me out. I will investigate further. If I have more questions, I'll be back.

[30-Mar-19 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@yope I'm not naive enough to believe that there are 0 vectors, just sure that the idea you were asking about isn't one of them

[30-Mar-19 02:15 PM] yope#8519
Ah, but back to my original question: Isn't there a sort of FAQ or other document with answers to these questions, which I assume I am by far not the only one asking?

Delayed Proof of Work Explained
It’s 2018, and we have recently witnessed many 51% attacks (Double Spending) on various Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains.

I don't think my reasoning is very special... I am a noob at blockcahin code still, and if I can come up with such a question in 2 hours of investigation, many others should also, given enough critical eyes look at this project.

[30-Mar-19 02:20 PM] yope#8519
Thanks, @CryptoNinjaa , but I have already seen that article.... will read it more thorooughly.

[30-Mar-19 02:20 PM] yope#8519
Until now I have found little deep technical details in it.

[30-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
How come KMD dont make a private blockchain and notarize to it? then no btc would be required to be spent and notarizing would be literally for free

[30-Mar-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
but having 64 notary nodes is sort of centralized aswell if we think that way

[30-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
i get ur point ^^

[30-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
was just a idea

[30-Mar-19 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How come KMD dont make a private blockchain and notarize to it?`
One of the reasons I can think of is "what if it becomes known/compromised?", if that ever happened, security would be nonexistent (and the de/centralized thing)

[30-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Markus#5464
ye i quess

[30-Mar-19 02:25 PM] yope#8519
That's centralized.

[30-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464
hmm

[30-Mar-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`privately controled, authorized chain` would be one way to get rid of the troll known as @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 😛

{Reactions}
💯 

[30-Mar-19 02:26 PM] yope#8519
But you cannot compare the 64 NN's to the mining network of bitcoin in terms of centralization.

[30-Mar-19 02:27 PM] yope#8519
How? There are a few bigger mining pools, but there are still a lot of individual miners...

[30-Mar-19 02:27 PM] yope#8519
in each pool

[30-Mar-19 02:29 PM] yope#8519
No, they can't

[30-Mar-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a lot of individual miners...
in each pool`
each of them are generally meaningless in the system, as they generally don't control nodes for more than 1-4 minute intervals

[30-Mar-19 02:29 PM] yope#8519
Consensus is spread through the network

[30-Mar-19 02:30 PM] yope#8519
How?

[30-Mar-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1 pool with 5000 miners that = 500 PH is no different, in any way, than 1 pool with 1 miner who has 500 PH

{Reactions}
☝ 

[30-Mar-19 02:32 PM] yope#8519
No.

[30-Mar-19 02:32 PM] yope#8519
The individual miners are.

[30-Mar-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, in a consensus manner; because, almost no miners ever know what consensus code their pool is running
which makes the miners moot

[30-Mar-19 02:34 PM] yope#8519
Still, the bitcoin network would reject a block with incorrect transactions in it...

[30-Mar-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's more to consensus than just tx confirmation

[30-Mar-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's entirely possible for Core to create consensus code that disallows any blocks to connect that are created by ClientX, just on client tag and nothing else (all else being equal)

[30-Mar-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
assuming pools run agreeing code

[30-Mar-19 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
consensus code, literally, defines what is/isn't acceptable

[30-Mar-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if pool owners really want to double spend or censor transactions, they can`
the latter is exceptionally easy

[30-Mar-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As much as I like to bag on Core, I think they would rollback an economically significant ds

[30-Mar-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
indeed

[30-Mar-19 02:41 PM] yope#8519
Some reports say, that right now it would cost you 1.4 billion USD to 51% attack the bitcoin network...

[30-Mar-19 02:41 PM] yope#8519
Gains would need to be vastly higher than that.

[30-Mar-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I still 1/2 wonder why Bitmain hasn't done it 😛

[30-Mar-19 02:42 PM] yope#8519
They can't. Bitmain is almost bankrupt.

[30-Mar-19 02:42 PM] yope#8519
No it is not for free. They still pay electricity

[30-Mar-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You underestimate the power of *not* selling mining equipment 😛

[30-Mar-19 02:43 PM] yope#8519
I still don't think it is that easy that pool owners can collude while miners just keep obeying them.

[30-Mar-19 02:44 PM] yope#8519
Why do you think that is possible?

[30-Mar-19 02:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'd estimate that 80% of miners wouldn't know anything that happened unless it was on reddit or twatter, and even then I don't think they'd understand

[30-Mar-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the majority of miners don't even understand the basics and a large portion have never even had a client and/or privkey

[30-Mar-19 02:47 PM] yope#8519
Yes, but I don't think that pool owners get hold of the blocks. If it was like that, someone would have called them out long ago.

[30-Mar-19 02:49 PM] yope#8519
The article you linked even says it: Pool owners concentrate hash power, but don't control it.

[30-Mar-19 02:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` If it was like that, someone would have called them out long ago.`
People ignore what they want, BM has been "called out" 1000 times for "covert" things and no one cares (partly because no direct evidence, partly because they just don't care as long as they get their $2)

Op Ed: Bitcoin Mining Attacks Are Overblown
The question here is whether bitcoin mining is a single point of failure. Could a government or other authority control Bitcoin through controlling a single entity in mining? What would it actually take to “take over”?
https://fs.bitcoinmagazine.com/img/images/jimmy_mining.max-800x800.jpg

[30-Mar-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I do a 51% and you "call me out", what good is your claim unless you can actively show what I did?

[30-Mar-19 02:54 PM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 What I meant by calling out is that if pool owners actually could control the hashing power they concentrate, that would be a known fact by now.

[30-Mar-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if pool owners actually could control the hashing power they concentrate, that would be a known fact by now.`
You mean like the literal pages slush has allowing miners to vote on consensus options?

[30-Mar-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
vs
other pools do whatever and miners don't know

[30-Mar-19 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"control" is a broad term

Of the title, I tend to agree and think that's why BM never did it

[30-Mar-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm loathe to admit that I don't see that "more profitable coin" in the near future ☹

[30-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
While I admit that the current architecture likely wouldn't allow for it to happen again, I'm still morally opposed to a mutable chain

[30-Mar-19 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think it could happen, but I don't think that would be the rally cry (too man fanboys and too many will never grasp what's wrong with Core control anyway)

tl;dw;
The past three years of vulnerability research and cryptanalysis has not been kind to the JOSE family of Internet standards (most commonly known as JSON Web Tokens a.k.a. JWT). This has led to many security experts declaring boldly, "Don't use JWT!" but has left many developers in want of a viable alternative.

[28-Apr-19 07:19 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
If there is any need for someone trained in network and transport layer security, let me know.

You can brute force open a password protected pkzip file for any password 16 chars or less using an Amazon cloud server for about 15 hours, costing ~$375 ($25 an hour). Don’t store bitcoin recovery keys in a pkzip unless they are worth less than that! https://t.co/SkJ1BH...

Hi everyone. 

After more than 4 months of trying to have BAY listed on the OEX exchange, we have had to concede to the fact that they have stolen our listing fee and will not be listing us. 
We have tried many times to get an exact date of listing and each time there has been a delay with various excuses.
Knowing we have had 3 BTC stolen which could have been spent on marketing or put towards another exchange listing is very frustrating. We will look into legal options to try and recover the fees, as long as it isn’t too expensive of course.
Please feel free to share this news on social media or other chats, and let’s help to make sure no other projects are scammed into losing money from this exchange.

[21-May-19 08:48 PM] vicmao#2684
Beware of OEX exchnge... BitBay paíd a listing fee, haven't been listed and they don't Payback It back. I'm a Komodo holder and a BitBay holder too. 
I just wanted to let you know and warn you.

[21-May-19 08:48 PM] vicmao#2684
Let's hope nobody else is scammed

[24-May-19 08:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes that's stated in the instructions, I made a few paperwallets in the past but always offline in a live ubuntu cd

[24-May-19 08:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
If the rng is compromised the paperwallet is at risk even when properly generated offline. Anyway the kmd version was forked long before the period mentioned, so it should be safe

[25-May-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```Step 0. Follow the security checklist recommendation

First step is to download this website from Github and open the index.html file directly from your computer. It's just too easy to sneak some evil code in the 6000+ lines of javascript to leak your private key, and you don't want to see your fund stolen. Code version control make it much easier to cross-check what actually run. For extra security, unplug your Internet access while generating your wallet. ```

Guess you get what you get when you don't follow instructions?

I asked and indeed it applies only to people who opened the website and disconnected from internet. Not the right way to use it. Downloading from github was always safe

[05-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Andy#1801
In times like these wallets should stick together to solve the issue.

[05-Jun-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if you use agama code from this year, then likely you are affected, if not, then very likely not as it appears agama was specifically targeted

[05-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Andy#1801
Is there a roadmap for when you plan to publicly announce the technical details? If it's not possible to get any details beforehand, I would at least like to know when I need to be awake to react immediately.

[05-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Andy#1801
We do not use any agama specific code though

[05-Jun-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it was an exploit that targeted a specific agama variable name
