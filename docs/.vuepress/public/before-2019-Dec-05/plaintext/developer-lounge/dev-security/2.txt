a single invalid tx makes a block that has it invalid

[13-Dec-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a decentralized system, the blockchain

[13-Dec-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
no central source, or hashrate dominator can just declare an invalid tx is valid

[13-Dec-18 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if 90% of chainX hashpower is controlled by malicious nodes`
they will be mining on their own chain that isn't recognized by legitimate nodes (because despite what CSW says, not all nodes are miners)

[13-Dec-18 06:46 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I think my understanding of cross-shard TXs is then lacking.

For a cross-shard TX a "burn" needs to happen. My understanding is that "burn" is an event that happens in a block in the source blockchain (call it chainX). Say the receiving chain is chainY.

Say 90% coalition in chainX creates an invalid chain in chainX that has an invalid block in it far in the past. They then create a block in that chain with an invalid block in which they do the "burn" and send such block to the chainY. How would chianY know the chain has an invalid block in it?

[13-Dec-18 06:46 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Is it expected that whomever accepts the transaction in chainY validates the entire chainX?

[13-Dec-18 06:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How would chianY know the chain has an invalid block in it?`
Because "invalid" by definition goes against consensus rules (as dictated by nodes, not miners)

[13-Dec-18 06:49 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
But isn't it nodes that operate chainX that know the block is invalid?
How would nodes that operate chainY and receive the cross-shard TX know that the chain is invalid?

[13-Dec-18 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't know momom enough to answer in detail here_

[13-Dec-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
because the notaries that notarize chainY notarize valid blockhash and merkleroots

[13-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I see. The notaries assigned to chainX that notarize to Komodo chain / Bitcoin validate all the blocks?

[13-Dec-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries that notarize a chain run a full node for that chain

[13-Dec-18 06:51 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Makes sense, running a full node by definition validates all the blocks

[13-Dec-18 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
ALL the notaries need to agree on the notarization, including MoMoM data

[13-Dec-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is stronger. the notaries cross check the chain it is being notarized to

[13-Dec-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so you know it is not only valid but notarized and not reorged

[13-Dec-18 06:52 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
All notaries in Komodo validate all chains, or different notaries are assigned to different chains?

[13-Dec-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
for now most notaries notarize most chains

[13-Dec-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the incentive is automatic reelection

[13-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Makes sense. But obviously long term you want to scale to an extent where most notaries would only be able to notarize a small fraction of the chains, right?

[13-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I guess the "100M tx/second" relies on that assumption?

[13-Dec-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the assumption is that notaries will be able to manage many nodes

[13-Dec-18 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
for 100 mil tx per second, it would require half a million chains! i dont think anybody said 100 million tx/sec anytime soon

[13-Dec-18 07:03 PM] Alex Skidanov#8668
well, 100m was mentioned in one of the post as a theoretically possible limit, not something short term :)

so the statement "security of Komodo relies on most notaries running most chains" is correct? (I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing, just trying to confirm my understanding)

[13-Dec-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
security of KMD relies on the notaries, yes

[13-Dec-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
of the entire ecosystem

[13-Dec-18 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and several external coins

[13-Dec-18 10:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nice to see you here @Alex Skidanov 
And glad to see this chat. Feel free to ask more anytime. 🙂

[07-Feb-19 04:11 PM] spaul#5353
Hello!  I'm working in a space where we are diving into a few insurance projects that will require notaries and have been discussing how the use of a 3rd party notary can be standarized

[07-Feb-19 04:20 PM] spaul#5353
any approved literature on the notarized nodes?

[07-Feb-19 04:39 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

@spaul also, for that kind of use case where there may be more control of notaries, e.g. your insurance consulting firm or the actual insurance companies wanting to run their own notary network, the #kmdlabs project are doing R&D into that aspect of it, because some environments will want to manage their own incentive structures, opsec, etc.

[07-Feb-19 08:29 PM] Mylo#8306
e.g.
```
SPAUL INSURANCE NN ---> KMD ---> BTC
MYLO CONSULTING FARM NN ---> KMD ---> BTC
```
then the actual KMD ---NN---> BTC elections, the different NN networks that exist may want to run for the annual elections etc.   but this may be something for 2020, 2021 in the strategic thinking of some of your types of  projects/companies/consulting etc.

[08-Feb-19 12:03 AM] spaul#5353
@Mylo  yes conceptually we are at the beginnings and have a similar timeline

as far as i know you were involved in the creation of the PAN token for the exchange Bitpanda, wouldn't Bitpanda also be a candidate for dPoW?

[16-Feb-19 07:07 AM] Mylo#8306
sorry i've not heard of PAN token.  if it's a bitcoin/zcash/litecoin/dash fork, yes - dPoW has been implmeneted on projects that started off as forks.   there are some differences between a v0.11 btc fork and v0.14 fork (e.g. segwit etc.) so depends when the fork was as to how many code changes required.   but all do-able.

[16-Feb-19 08:22 PM] digital bullion#8223
Pan is an ERC 20 I believe.

[25-Mar-19 08:18 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm not using their widget, only api
not really sure what's your question
it's a 3rd party api like any other api
they don't use any security tokens so i'd say it's somewhat degraded level
make sure you don't leak your api key anywhere

[26-Mar-19 11:54 PM] Paul#0981

Hi all. I am new to this discord, and the amount of information here is a bit overwhelming, so my excuses if I ask questions that have been asked before.

[30-Mar-19 01:28 PM] yope#8519
I am investigating Komodo security and have questions that I assume others have asked before. Nevertheless I have not been able to find some sort of FAQ or other resource answering simple questions like this for example: "Why is the use of curated notary nodes any different than just trusting some central authority for snapshotting the main chain in a simple database?"

[30-Mar-19 01:29 PM] yope#8519
If anyone has a pointer to a source that addresses these kind of questions, that's be appreciated.

[30-Mar-19 01:31 PM] yope#8519
But the public keys of the notary nodes are included in the source code, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:31 PM] yope#8519
So I cannot run a notary node, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:32 PM] yope#8519
Who are stake holders?

[30-Mar-19 01:32 PM] yope#8519
So that makes it have the same drawbacks of PoS, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:34 PM] yope#8519
Voters with more stake have power to influence consensus.

[30-Mar-19 01:34 PM] yope#8519
Notary nodes have a mining advantage, right? They can mine at lower difficulty.

[30-Mar-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if one were to assume that voters could influence NNs, then their power of influence would only be over the lowest performing NNs anyway

[30-Mar-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the highest performing NNs get "auto" re-elected based on performance

[30-Mar-19 01:37 PM] yope#8519
Isn't it true that If one entity accumulates enough staking power, he could eventually chose most or all NN's?

[30-Mar-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and "at worst" the "influence" would only extend to holding back blocks of the least performing NNs anyway

[30-Mar-19 01:38 PM] yope#8519
Holding back blocks opens a window of 51% attacks on the KMD chain....

[30-Mar-19 01:38 PM] yope#8519
Not exactly harmless, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Holding back blocks opens a window of 51% attacks on the KMD chain....`
No, because those "susceptible" are, by definition, producing less to begin with

[30-Mar-19 01:40 PM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , how is an NN's "performance" determined?

[30-Mar-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
by performing notarizations and producing KMD blocks

[30-Mar-19 01:41 PM] yope#8519
@Deleted User , sorry to be critical about this, but I am not convinced of that yet...

[30-Mar-19 01:41 PM] yope#8519
I am here to learn and discover truth

[30-Mar-19 01:42 PM] yope#8519
@Deleted User, but if said whale gets hold of a few NN's, he has a significant mining advantage, so he could even outmine the rest of the network in a 10minute window if the network is sufficiently weak.

[30-Mar-19 01:44 PM] yope#8519
What do you mean by that? Isn't KMD using PoW (if we discount the NN's for a moment)?

[30-Mar-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
between the dev nodes and top NNs keeping their jobs by doing their jobs, there's not a "breaking point" where stopage could be bought
even if you assume that all but minsig NNs were corrupted, that 1 group would negate the stoppage of all the rest

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` Isn't KMD using PoW (if we discount the NN's for a moment)?`
You can't "discount the NNs", because their notarizations are akin to live checkpoints

[30-Mar-19 01:47 PM] yope#8519
@Deleted User , But that KMD mining is done via PoW, right? So if you have access to vast hashing power, and control a few NN's, that would make it easier to outmine the rest of the network in the 10 minute snapshot window, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:48 PM] yope#8519
Not in the 10 minute window

[30-Mar-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But that KMD mining is done via PoW, right? So if you have access to vast hashing power, and control a few NN's, that would make it easier to outmine the rest of the network in the 10 minute snapshot window, right?`
You can't negate the checkpointing that the majority of NNs do if you only control "a few" and if you control all *but* "a few", you can't negate the checkpointing that those few do

[30-Mar-19 01:49 PM] yope#8519
Ok, so if an attacker controls a few NN's, he has an added mining advantage (lower difficulty) and that could help him outmine the rest of the network in that 10 minute window, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:50 PM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I am not saying I take over the NN's chekpointing work, just control some of them to gain mining power.

[30-Mar-19 01:51 PM] yope#8519
What do you mean by that?

[30-Mar-19 01:51 PM] yope#8519
Who can't chose when to mine?

[30-Mar-19 01:52 PM] yope#8519
Yes, but if the network has decided that I get a few NN's (because I am a staking whale), I can "easy mine" whenever and however much I chose, right?

[30-Mar-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The only "successful" theory would involve controlling 52 NNs

{Reactions}
💯 

[30-Mar-19 01:53 PM] yope#8519
No.

[30-Mar-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes

[30-Mar-19 01:53 PM] yope#8519
Why can't I chose?

[30-Mar-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you control less than 52 NNs, then 13 can still notarize

[30-Mar-19 01:53 PM] yope#8519
How's that?

[30-Mar-19 01:54 PM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , with all due respect, let @Deleted User answer, I think he understands my question. You OTOH do not...

[30-Mar-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[30-Mar-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"hacker" 🤣

[30-Mar-19 01:55 PM] yope#8519
He keeps coming with the 51 NN argument, but I am not debating that.

[30-Mar-19 01:56 PM] yope#8519
Ok, but I am one and you are two, and out-typing both of your answer storms is not that easy.... 😅

[30-Mar-19 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that's the point, the power is meaningless to go back past the checkpoint
all the power in the world is negated by 1 tx/block

[30-Mar-19 01:57 PM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , I am not debating that. I know that. But there are 10 minutes between snapshots, right?

{Reactions}
💯 

[30-Mar-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on average, yes
so, you can roll back 12 blocks and have 1 confirmation on your "controlled" tx
what are you doing with that 1 confirmation?

[30-Mar-19 01:59 PM] yope#8519
I want to understand the risks of attacking the network in between these checkpoints successfully.

[30-Mar-19 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in between checkpoints, transactions never get a 2nd confirmation

[30-Mar-19 02:00 PM] yope#8519
Why not? Aren't there many blockes mined in that timeframe?

[30-Mar-19 02:00 PM] yope#8519
One each 1 minute and 2 seconds, right?

[30-Mar-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rawconfirmations increase with blocks
confirmations stay at 1 until notarized, at which point confirmations = rawconfirmations

[30-Mar-19 02:01 PM] yope#8519
But that would make confirmations as slow as on BTC....

[30-Mar-19 02:01 PM] yope#8519
🤔

[30-Mar-19 02:02 PM] yope#8519
Ok.

[30-Mar-19 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But that would make confirmations as slow as on BTC....`
*only* to that 1st number, after that confirms = blocks
if you need 20 confirms, as a general rule, that will equal 20 blocks

[30-Mar-19 02:04 PM] yope#8519
Well... I have only spent 2 hours or so looking at the whitepaper and the code on github.

[30-Mar-19 02:04 PM] yope#8519
I am far from convinced yet.
