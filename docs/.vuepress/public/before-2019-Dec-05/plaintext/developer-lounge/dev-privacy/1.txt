Hi

[21-Nov-18 07:23 AM] plazma#1625
Advantages of jumbler plz 😜

[21-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Alright#0419
it makes all z -> t transactions fungible(exactly the same)

[21-Nov-18 07:45 AM] plazma#1625
Yea

[21-Nov-18 07:45 AM] plazma#1625
😀

[21-Nov-18 07:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
technical:
t -> z, z -> z, z -> t
fixed amount ranging from 10, 100, 1000, 10000
on random time

result, anonymous untraceable coins in a public address.
how these public funds in t address are used is up to the user.

This behavior of anonymsing funds in transparent transactions is not possible with other zcash family projects.

[21-Nov-18 07:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if KMD is equally anonymous to Pirate, then the reason is Jumblr

[21-Nov-18 07:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but only when it's usage is more. right now there aren't many doing jumbling

[21-Nov-18 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
you can obtain the same amount of privacy on any zkSNARKs coin if you're diligent about it

[21-Nov-18 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
what jumblr does is make it much harder to make a mistake

[21-Nov-18 07:59 AM] Alright#0419
it's *very* hard to be diligent about it btw

[21-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
pirate makes it impossible to make a mistake 😛

[21-Nov-18 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct 👍

[24-Nov-18 03:23 PM] plazma#1625
jumblr is so cool...can we have a future implimentation where 10 inputs with same 10 komodo is jumbled to a sapling address and distributed between multiple sapling output z address so if someone puts funds at r address its origin is shows as mixed.....

[24-Nov-18 03:24 PM] plazma#1625
We can have the best mixer.....😀

everyone 
I want to create a page that has the list of all the repositories and resources that are useful in our ecosystem.
Please comment here any that you can think of. or add it here: https://kmdlabs.cc/p/kmd-resources

A sample of things that I want links to are:

@grewalsatinder made one too i think with the same intentions

[14-Mar-19 01:17 PM] gcharang#6833
yes. this one: https://github.com/satindergrewal/awesome-kmd but seems many people didn't submit PR to github.
So I am asking here so that I can add them myself

A google doc in dev-privacy channel? 😒

[14-Mar-19 02:00 PM] gcharang#6833
haha just a convenient place to edit. The info is anyway gonna be public 😉

[14-Mar-19 02:03 PM] zatJUM#9924
There are other convenient places to edit that are "privacy-friendly" (cf. etherpad for example)

Well guys now that the privacy considerations are over send some repos my way please 🙇

[14-Mar-19 03:45 PM] gcharang#6833
@jorian thanks for the contribution, I had completely forgotten about your RUST client

[14-Mar-19 03:46 PM] gcharang#6833
Heres a first draft: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/general/third-party-repos-resources.html
Please go through it and suggest any other resources/repos that come to mind
by looking at the Section names

[15-Mar-19 12:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can make someone admin of my repo if that helps 
It also is linked to the easy to remember domain
Would really appreciate help in keeping it updated and organized 
Do whatever you think is good with it's format plz

not sure if the one you have listed supports this feature

[15-Mar-19 12:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will try updating the repo readme a bit this weekend

[15-Mar-19 05:26 AM] gcharang#6833

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 does EWBF's CUDA Zcash miner work with KMD directly or does it need tweaking?

[15-Mar-19 05:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that one works, the newer one does not

[15-Mar-19 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since that one is stable, he cut 200,9 entirely out of the new one

Would a Z phone work? Or Z text? @dukeleto Duke?? I know it's in the works...but reality is what? Pirate chain could accomplish this right??? Expecialy if KVM pirate and labs is somehow combined.....it can be burned as read or as it heard.... I might have had a beer tonight

[27-Apr-19 05:21 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
It would be a CC-as used contract

There was supposed to be z chat or something a while back?

Hi,
Could someone please tell me what SC param I use to make a chain that has both `t` and `z` transactions?

[18-Aug-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
I found `-ac_private=1` and `ac_public=1`.

[18-Aug-19 01:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Both of those?

[18-Aug-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, both are available by default

[18-Aug-19 01:37 PM] CrisF#3405
Cool, I'll give it a try.

[18-Aug-19 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never tried it, but it would seem to me that if you set both then all txes would be "outlawed" 😛

[18-Aug-19 01:49 PM] CrisF#3405
I'll try with neither first.

[18-Aug-19 01:49 PM] CrisF#3405
That's how it used to be. As you say, default.

The issue you guys found regarding shielded address ip association

[29-Sep-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
we didnt discover it, zcash team did

[29-Sep-19 06:40 PM] sidhujag#3327
I wonder if that has farther reaching consequences because bitcoin recently added a new p2p mechanism to add random timing to hide who did tx and I doubt many of the zcash forks added that yet so you can trace down to who created a tx and where it’s relayed from and to

[29-Sep-19 06:40 PM] sidhujag#3327
Oh article says Komodo core dev found

[29-Sep-19 06:41 PM] sidhujag#3327
So duke didn’t find it and post on his journal?

[29-Sep-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
zcash told us and there was a zcash security advisory.

[29-Sep-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
after that, duke did post on his blog

[29-Sep-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
as far as correlating transactions, zaddr tx are encrypted, so it is hard to correlate it to any specific zaddr, though it might be possible to use that information to add to an overall database of associations

[29-Sep-19 06:43 PM] sidhujag#3327
Yep

[29-Sep-19 06:44 PM] sidhujag#3327

Erlay : efficient transaction relay in Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a top-ranked cryptocurrency that has experienced huge growth and survived numerous attacks. The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore accommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. However, Bitcoin’s transaction dissemination protocol has mostly ...

[30-Sep-19 01:32 AM] jl777c#5810
erlay is very interesting

[30-Sep-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
however it seems to be more about bandwidth efficiency than privacy...

[30-Sep-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
```Timing attacks from public nodes. Erlay’s design is more robust to timing
attacks from private sybils [18, 29]. Robustness to timing attacks from public
nodes remains an open questions. Both BTCFlood and Erlay use faster relay to
public nodes and slower relay to private nodes. But Erlay’s slower reconciliation
could be abused by public nodes to more easily identify transactions originating
from private nodes. With higher node connectivity this attack becomes expensive,
but a general solution remains as future work.```

[30-Sep-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
any attacker would use a public node, so erlay actually reduces privacy. if they are positioning erlay as a privacy enhancement that is not correct

Hi, could someone please tell me how much data can be sent in a Z-tx?  

I looked in `help |grep z_` and didn't see where/how the data would be sent.  I thought that there was a 'message' type of function but couldn't find anything.  How would the data be sent?

[05-Oct-19 11:54 AM] phm87#7395
Do you mean in the OP_RETURN of each tx ? (I don't know if it is present nor if it is in clear for z tx)
<https://komodod.com/t/71973b461ee94ba3cb8b2214529d103314114bebd42512b38847823ebaf6eff3>
I heard that messages are also possible in privacy coins such as HUSH (and maybe others) but I don't know if the message is public or private

[05-Oct-19 12:03 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I heard of private messaging too.  I don't know if it was an OP_RETURN though.
Oh, I saw something similar to this on a slide in a presentation today `jLLw�O�Q(��:AKx��t`

[05-Oct-19 12:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Now I know what it was!

That ☝ isn't a z_tx, the guy was seeing who knew what.  I'm 6 hours late!

[05-Oct-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
that should be an ETH transaction on photo above (metamask is ETH browser wallet)

512 bytes in ztx memo field

[05-Oct-19 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it's ETH @TonyL.  Called FLOW.  That guy was one of the cryptokitty guys.

[05-Oct-19 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
just read some ETH docs - in ETH amout of data which you can put into "data" field limited only by block gaslimit

[05-Oct-19 12:18 PM] TonyL#3577
so maybe if you has enough ETH it's possible to rekt blocks by huge messages

Thanks @jl777c 🙇 I see the memo field now :abusedsmily:

[05-Oct-19 12:21 PM] CrisF#3405
🤔 = `Tony Attack` 🙂

[05-Oct-19 12:22 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry for my confusion CrisF, I never played with signed msgs nor with op return data. I read that signed msgs don t require coins.
Maybe jl777 posted the solution: use the 512 bytes in ztx memo field

[05-Oct-19 12:22 PM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhhh maybe it was the memo field that was increased into Hush, I am not sure

[05-Oct-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
This is very, very useful.  I have seen talk of `zero-knowledge proofs` and `zk-blah blah blah` in some serious business docs recently.

[05-Oct-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
Now got some thinking to do...

[05-Oct-19 12:25 PM] CrisF#3405
(not like Tony's ETH attack thinking 🙂  )
