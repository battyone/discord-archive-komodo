this is huge

[30-Jun-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
seems that they could easily pay for sapling support added to breadwallet

[30-Jun-19 03:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if sapling signing is the task, I guess we can also just post about this first task in Zcash community places and get a dev for doing this task ü§î

[30-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Fab√ò#8941
we should almost buy them out before we start and own this wallet

[30-Jun-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
doubt that is possible, as they have a company based on this wallet, been around since 2012(?), did an ICO

[30-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Fab√ò#8941
tks for your insight

[30-Jun-19 03:35 PM] Fab√ò#8941
I am gonna do some due dil to understand where they coming from where they are heading to and what can of deal we could leverage

[30-Jun-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder can you see if there is any existing SPV wallet for ZEC taddr?

[30-Jun-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, we should be able to get zcash foundation to help with funding for that portion of this

[30-Jun-19 03:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
sure, will dig on to github and search engines

[30-Jun-19 03:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or I'll probably just sign up with Zcash foundation community and ask them directly, they might have better knowledge if there is already one.

@Fab√ò

[30-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the perfect dev for this!

[30-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
someone that did a normal SPV wallet especially sapling taddr, if the wallet is good of course

[30-Jun-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we should test it to make sure it does headers only sync and works stable

[30-Jun-19 04:29 PM] Fab√ò#8941
thanks @grewalsatinder copy that

[30-Jun-19 04:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I know @ca333 knows mobile Java stuff. I guess he can help with it.

[30-Jun-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure Java is a tech stack ca333 will like

[30-Jun-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but to get a quick proof of concept, maybe it is ok

[30-Jun-19 04:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, I'd even think some Java and C/C++ dev who can port the changes from this Java logic to breadwallet-core, just in case the logic porting is the thing.
I know it looks more work, but just had a quick thought

[30-Jun-19 04:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So far I couldn't find any other Zcash SPV project other than this library I found, and that guy I mentioned is the main dev for it.

[30-Jun-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i like the breadwallet core as it is in C

[30-Jun-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe we can approach breadwallet dev too and it is much better to become part of official breadwallet than guarda wallet

[30-Jun-19 04:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree, I will leave the contacting to @Fab√ò and @Tierno üôÇ

[30-Jun-19 04:46 PM] Fab√ò#8941
perfect will be done

[30-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
so advantage of guarda is already the zcash sapling is supported, but downside is that it is in java and guarda wallet is much smaller installed base than breadwallet

[30-Jun-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
breadwallet is much larger installed base and in C, but no zcash sapling support

[30-Jun-19 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, and pretty sure BreadWallet team will love to have Sapling support added in their code, and now they can also have a look at the Zcash-SPV codebase for required logic to implement üòâ

[30-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Fab√ò#8941
humm seems that Guarda has an hedge no?

[30-Jun-19 04:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if they really go with that, even on their own, that'd be kinda half requirement done.

[30-Jun-19 04:49 PM] Fab√ò#8941
yep can see that, seems like the distance and difficulties are higher with breadwallet compare to guarda no?

[30-Jun-19 04:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
also probably less ego on the guarda wallet

[30-Jun-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
a bit, but supporting zcash family must be an attractive thing for breadwallet for expanding market and it would give you a good reason to get involved with zcash foundation

[30-Jun-19 04:50 PM] Fab√ò#8941
seems like we will get an easier time negociating

are we doing the gemini thing contacting both?

i leave to you, how best you see this

[30-Jun-19 04:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c thank for that innovative post on nSPV tech today. It's been a best day start for me after so long! üòÉ

[30-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
ok thanks JL

[30-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Fab√ò#8941
will do

[30-Jun-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
found a dev that can start in about a month or so on the breadwallet work, so maybe we just need to convince them to help us in the effort and to accept a PR once it is working so it gets added to their standard breadwallet. having a secondary effort on the java path would make sense as it is better to have two solutions ready to go than rely on one

[30-Jun-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so pursue talks with breadwallet, we need the path paved for them to accept the PR when we get the nSPV working, along with some advice along the way (if we need it). and on the java side, maybe we can see if the java dev is interested in adding nSPV support

[01-Jul-19 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
I can totally translate the Java code in modern c++ if someone is interested

[01-Jul-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
seems best to add the nSPV functionality to the java code, in java

[01-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Slyris#2880
You want to fork the project ?

[01-Jul-19 08:56 AM] Slyris#2880
Oh ok i read the whole conversation, very interesting, I need to dive into the code, and by the way nice article on nSPV very interesting

[01-Jul-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
starting from https://github.com/guardaco/zcash-SPV which supports sapling, it seems we need to replace the header syncing

and change to a per-utxo validation

[01-Jul-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that can then invoke a series of p2p queries to find the notarizations bracketing the utxo, getting the headers between the first and last notarization, then validating that they link backwards properly. once that is done, a standard merkle proof for the utxo for whichever block it was in. at that point we know the utxo is "in" the merkleroot, which is in the block, which is in the segment of the blockchain that is notarized

[01-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
separately to this logic, we need a way to know what utxo an address has, so there will be some extra p2p messages supported that allow to query for notarizations, addressutxos/txids, txproofs

[01-Jul-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV avoids having to do the headers sync, which for bitcoin is only 80 bytes per block, but for equihash it is 2kb, so a much bigger issue for equihash coins. even for 80 byte headers, one million blocks is 80mb of data that is needed. nSPV for 80 byte headers would be less than 1kb of data plus txproof to validate a utxo

[01-Jul-19 09:02 AM] Slyris#2880
It's really interesting, I'm reading the code of the spv library

[01-Jul-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so depending on what you compare to 100x, 1000x or 10000x less data

[01-Jul-19 09:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes, if I understand your article is an huge improvement

[01-Jul-19 09:02 AM] Slyris#2880
And disruptive approach

[01-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
basically achieves the same goals of flyclient without any complex math, not that there is anything wrong with complex math and fancy algo. just not something you can code up in a relatively small amount of time. with nSPV,  the code changes would be minimal

[01-Jul-19 09:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Did you plan to write a paper ? I mean a PDF with full details ?

[01-Jul-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems simple enough. does it need a paper? i think just need to define the p2p messages needed to support the nSPV clients

[01-Jul-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
getnotarization, getaddressutxos, gettxproof

[01-Jul-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
basically mapping existing rpc calls to p2p message

[01-Jul-19 09:05 AM] Slyris#2880
It's simple, yes but it's very interesting

[01-Jul-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
simple is not a pejorative, it is in fact a very good attribute. much less chance for bugs!

[01-Jul-19 09:05 AM] Slyris#2880
We absolutely need this.

[01-Jul-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i estimate each 1000 full nodes can support a million nSPV clients

[01-Jul-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe even more for special full nodes configured to handle a lot of client connections

[01-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Slyris#2880
We can probably benchmark it once we have something ready

[01-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. and i prefer to document things after it is working

[01-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm at work now, I will look deeper when I'm at home

[01-Jul-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the nSPV blogpost describes enough to guide how to do it. if you are able to do this, i am sure we can gather up a bounty for it and i can help define the specifcs that are needed, and probably just code up the required daemon side code. we can launch a smartchain just to test this and get it working

[01-Jul-19 09:12 AM] Slyris#2880
I will play with the existing spv client to understand how it's work first, and then I will try to make a playground and playing with it, once I learn how its work I will of course try to implement what you described in your blog post

[01-Jul-19 09:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Thank's for the information and the repository

[01-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
you will need to connect to a coin network with the nSPV p2p messages, let me know a few days before you are ready to test and i can have the daemon side ready

[01-Jul-19 09:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok firstly I'm reading and I will look deeper this evening.

[01-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[01-Jul-19 09:44 AM] Slyris#2880
If I have any question, I will let you know in ask-jl777c channel

[01-Jul-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[02-Jul-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
@Slyris i made a stubbed out, but functional -nSPV=1 mode in my nSPV branch. you can see where the client side is headed in the komodo_nSPV.h file

[02-Jul-19 06:58 PM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c Thank's i will check it

[02-Jul-19 07:01 PM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c Can you explain me :

```cpp
    uint8_t nSolution[1344]; //! <- 
```

I dont understand this array size

[02-Jul-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
size of equihash solution

[02-Jul-19 07:06 PM] Slyris#2880
ok i get it

[02-Jul-19 07:07 PM] Slyris#2880
Is it for compilation speed that you use C functionnality instead of C++ ? (such as time functionnality) ?

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I like to fully understand what the code is doing. with C, I can do this. not so with C++

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok !

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
also, it is very likely we will need to port this to pure C

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and so i want to minimize c++ usage as much as possible

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Slyris#2880
There is a line where you cast the return of time to uint32_t and another line where you didn't

[02-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Slyris#2880
but i think is not important

[02-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Slyris#2880
I understand you, if you can do it without using any std library, it's will improve your compilation time

[02-Jul-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed the missing (uint32_t)

[02-Jul-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
some compilers spit out warnings if isnt done
