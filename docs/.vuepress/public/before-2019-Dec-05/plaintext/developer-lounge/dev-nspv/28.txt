yes, jl777 branch building for windows

[25-Jul-19 05:54 PM] TonyL#3577
let me check for unix

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
interesting that it shows :7771/bootstrap.min.css

[25-Jul-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
let me add a hack to allow that to be mapped also

[25-Jul-19 05:58 PM] TonyL#3577
upd unix building fine too on latest jl777

[25-Jul-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, try on windows now

[25-Jul-19 06:04 PM] TonyL#3577

btw maybe it worked on previous commit too (messed up with upstreams hehe)

[25-Jul-19 06:05 PM] TonyL#3577
can check previous commit if needed

[25-Jul-19 06:06 PM] TonyL#3577
windows is os for puzzle lovers as I understand 😃

[25-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it works now, that is all that matters

[25-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there are thousands of older commits, but if the latest version is working better than the rest, who cares about them

[25-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that windows is searching for a DIFFERENT filename, prepending :7771 to it!

@TonyL pushed fix so it will work for non-KMD coins too

[25-Jul-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also do you know how to add a new coin to coins file? it is good to know how to do

[25-Jul-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and now we just need a cross platform installer that can launch ./nspv and open the 127.0.0.1:port page

[25-Jul-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i am working with satinder to get the html wallet actually working, but as far as installer goes as long as the html files are in html directory where the ./nspv is when launched, it will work

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and my analysis is that the localhost html will be pretty much as secure as cli, the only exception is if your browser has some sort of localhost intercept exploit

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
it is totally static .html

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
no javascript

[25-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
all dynamically generated from inside nspv

[25-Jul-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can get what looks like a webwallet, with electrum server speed, nearly fullnode cli security

@radix42 could you check to see if libnspv builds and runs on 32bit arm?

[25-Jul-19 07:17 PM] radix42#3743
I can fire up my 32 bit arm machine later yes

[25-Jul-19 07:20 PM] radix42#3743

it has about 300kb executable size, 3MB RAM usage when it is a superlite client

./nspv should just connect to KMD nodes

[25-Jul-19 08:06 PM] radix42#3743
doh! i disconnected that box, but i just built on a 64 bit arm and will try on that

[25-Jul-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can verify it works on arm and especially 32bit arm, that opens up iot usage for nspv

[25-Jul-19 08:08 PM] radix42#3743
i can reconnect my 32 bit arm machine later, i had to steal a keyboard from one of my kids to fire it up lol

[25-Jul-19 08:08 PM] radix42#3743
what does success look like? it connects and disconnected from two nodes

[25-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it should just print some ipaddresses

[25-Jul-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes those are non-nSPV fullnodes

[25-Jul-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you can issue a getinfo or getpeerinfo via curl

[25-Jul-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
or if it has a browser, via http://127.0.0.1:7771/api/method/getinfo

[25-Jul-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
http://127.0.0.1:7771 might bring up a wallet html

[25-Jul-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact it went up to node 18 and 23 means it has over 10 peers

[25-Jul-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so you should be able to login with wif, send funds to it, listunspent to see it and spend to sign a valid tx

[25-Jul-19 08:13 PM] radix42#3743
I can do a getpeerinfo curl just fine!

[25-Jul-19 08:14 PM] radix42#3743
I'll try it on the 32 bit arm later

These amazing #superlite wallets are coming quickly to $HUSH, which also has smart contracts enabled that #nSPV can interact with. It's really exciting to see something drastically better than Electrum evolve in a matter of weeks.
Time to throw Electrum away, very soon. ht...

I can't say enough good things about nSPV

[26-Jul-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no CC support in nspv yet, in komodod -nSPV=1 mode there is most of the CC supported. so it is indeed possible, just not done yet

[26-Jul-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
adding skipcount and search filters would allow electrum to support addresses with a lot more utxo, not sure why they dont

[26-Jul-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326

i made the nSPV_CCtx.h file with a stub for faucet get, but i will leave it to mihailo and blackjok3r to implement. now that we have utxo selection with CCflag, it really is just a matter to construct the tx and sign it. i guess the cryptoconditions signing code needs to be ported too... maybe i will get the first one working as an example, but next step is the secure html wallet

[26-Jul-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might have to rethink how Im doing this validation. I should have slept before starting it. its a total mess

[26-Jul-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont know what I have done or  if its the main nodes, but the hashPrevBlock and blockhash seem to be the same 😦

[26-Jul-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Guess I will start my own full nodes to isolate it

[26-Jul-19 05:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
how is txproof used?
```bash
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "txproof", "params": ["e07709088fa2690fdc71b43b5d7760689e42ca90f7dfb74b18bf47a1ad94c855",0,1453881 ] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$port/

[26-Jul-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i should add the actual hex of the tx and txproof, it is more an internal function so it wasnt critical, there will be a gettransaction api that will work for getting rawtx bytes

[26-Jul-19 06:30 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

[26-Jul-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i will add a "hex" field for the rawtransaction bytes an "proof" for the txproof

[27-Jul-19 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Going to have to totally start again and add more code to daemon to make the validation work. Simply cannot make it sync backwards won't fetch the headers, I spent 2 entire days messing with it and got not very far. Best thing to do will be to fetch all of the headers from say 3     random nodes, all in one call, because getinfo spam just breaks everything.

[27-Jul-19 03:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
What if 1 or 2 nodes disagree on headers, or all 3 are malicious? Electrum is dealing with problems just like this, so I think it's important to design for that threat scenario

[27-Jul-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it fetch blocks randomly from all nodes, but it just wont handle the load

[27-Jul-19 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either there is some fatal flaw in how it all works, or I did something wrong, but it doesnt seem to me you can quickly request blocks from some X% of nodes

[27-Jul-19 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As things are that is. I think an extra call needs to be made that can fetch a range of headers from 1 node. 
Then the client can request the range from multiple nodes, then compare them to make sure they match. We only need to find 1 notarization that all nodes agree on I think, but that doesnt mean a node and just make fake block headers, after this notarization

[27-Jul-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So you need to have data from many nodes ..

[27-Jul-19 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Even then, many nodes could be malicious.

[27-Jul-19 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The other way to do it, is just make people wait 🤣  
You just cant make any tx or do anything until it has enough received blocks.

[27-Jul-19 04:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
We want to make the average attack scenario more costly for the attacker while not reducing user-visible features, if possible

[27-Jul-19 04:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r choose 10 nodes randomly each startup, and I would say that is pretty good. If it isn't, you are being Sybil-attacked and probably have worse problems

[27-Jul-19 04:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
James explained that you only need 1 good server to prove the other 9 wrong

[27-Jul-19 04:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, but you need allthe data from ALL the nodes to do that

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you ned a full node basically

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
that means only 10% of network needs to be good servers, on average, to protect against 90% evil servers

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
When it starts up, there is onyl 1 node

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
james's

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then his node sends you the rest

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
what about the concept of a DNS seed?

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at start up I cant randomly choose a few nodes because they are not there

[27-Jul-19 04:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
a hostname which returns many IPs, trusted seed nodes

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
baked into src code

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its already there, james just didnt use it

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I assume that will drop right in

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
in any case thats not really important

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
what problem are you trying to solve, exactly?

[27-Jul-19 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
How it works now,. is all node you are connected to send you the `getinfo` call
