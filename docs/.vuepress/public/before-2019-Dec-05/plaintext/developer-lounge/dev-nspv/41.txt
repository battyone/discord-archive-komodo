sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev curl libevent-dev git cmake nano wget ntp ntpdate automake unzip autoconf libtool -y

[13-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is libsodium-dev

[13-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[13-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
the list of dependencies is out of date

[13-Aug-19 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
`sudo apt-get install libsodium-dev` @allbits

[13-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
we probably need to update the readme with the appropriate magic apt-get

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c it depends on version of Ubuntu as well, so it gets complex

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
google helps

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ubuntu 16 package names != Ubuntu 18 package names

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i always just google the missing error package

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, package names are annoying like that

[13-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits probably also `sudo apt-get install libevent-dev`

[13-Aug-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
i often install `aptitude`, then you can do `aptitude search foo`

[13-Aug-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
and avoid google @jl777c

@allbits it's probably going to compile for a long time. If it's still going, that is a good sign

[13-Aug-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits does your chromebook have 2GB of ram or 4GB? The compile will probably fail with only 2gb

[13-Aug-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
but there are ways to get around that

[13-Aug-19 03:09 PM] allbits#5898
Compile successful. ./nspv KMD working in terminal, discovering peers etc

updating libnspv apt-get in libnspv repo makes sense, if komodo line was out of date, then that too

[13-Aug-19 03:11 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, that is the standalone version

komodod also has all the functionality

I have the deps for libnspv here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/nSPV/#installation

@grewalsatinder is there a way to tell the .html to refuse to run javascript?

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] allbits#5898
Yes it does say that in the console

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
http://127.0.0.1:7771

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
try that exact url

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
not https

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c interesting question. There is a way to detect if JS is off via HTML

[13-Aug-19 03:12 PM] allbits#5898
I did. "This site can't be reached"

[13-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you have the bind sock.n API enabled message?

[13-Aug-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
if it's not off, it's on. Maybe you could hook into an "autodestruct if JS is on" @jl777c , but it's called <noscript></noscript> Not sure how to detect the inverse

[13-Aug-19 03:13 PM] allbits#5898
Yes

[13-Aug-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c we could play JS games, and if we see they work, we assume JS is on and do seppuku

[13-Aug-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the browser is configured to not be able to go to 127.0.0.1

[13-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
like, use JS to modify the DOM. And then see if it is actually modified

[13-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
if modified => JS is on. You can do evil things with CSS

[13-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
CSS is turing complete

@jl777c i think i know @allbits problem

[13-Aug-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the page is autogenerated so when i add an SHA256 checksum to all the template files, it really cant be changed

[13-Aug-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits you must tell me, how is linux installed on your CB?

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
127.0.0.1 don't mean what you think it does

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
Chromebooks have VLANs

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but would be nice to have a JS disabled method in the template

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, so its 192.... type of address?

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be completely isolated

[13-Aug-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
chromebooks use recent linux kernel jails for IO/everything

[13-Aug-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
try http://localhost:7771

[13-Aug-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a config setting somewhere

[13-Aug-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
to allow packets between VMs and the main Chromebook OS

[13-Aug-19 03:18 PM] allbits#5898
I'm not even sure how I installed linux. I went to open the terminal app a couple of days and it just asked me if I wanted to install Linux so I said yes

[13-Aug-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what does http://localhost:7771/ do?

[13-Aug-19 03:18 PM] allbits#5898
Same thing

[13-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
in the browser settings (advanced) is there anything about disabling localhost or preventing browsing to internal sites

[13-Aug-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
chromebook does seem to have some strangenesses about localhost

[13-Aug-19 03:22 PM] gcharang#6833
@allbits 
try
```
hostname -I
```
if it says
```
100.115.92.196
```
visit
100.115.92.196:7771

[13-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
nspv blocks anything that isnt 127.0.0.1

[13-Aug-19 03:23 PM] gcharang#6833
ahh, that won't work then

[13-Aug-19 03:23 PM] allbits#5898
Yeah I tried that after googling

[13-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i can add a -allowip= option so when you launch nspv it would allow that specific ip address

in jl777 branch, git pull and make

[13-Aug-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
then

No success

[13-Aug-19 03:35 PM] allbits#5898
Console does return

set external ip to 100.115.92.205

[13-Aug-19 03:35 PM] allbits#5898
It also returns 127.0.0.1:7771 bind sock enabled

[13-Aug-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810

so much progress, in here. it's lovely

[13-Aug-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
its actually binding 0.0.0.0:7771 so if that works, it wouldnt matter the external ip

[13-Aug-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but lets test binding a specific ip address

[13-Aug-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, does curl work to 127.0.0.1:7771 ?

[13-Aug-19 03:45 PM] allbits#5898
How do I test that

[13-Aug-19 03:46 PM] allbits#5898
I did curl 127.0.0.1:7771

[13-Aug-19 03:46 PM] allbits#5898
Yes it worked

[13-Aug-19 03:46 PM] allbits#5898
Returned the html stuff in console

[13-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, try the latest version

[13-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
git pull

[13-Aug-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
make

[13-Aug-19 03:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c chromebooks support ipv6 as well, just a thought. Not sure if your code checks ipv6 loopback. It might not need to deal with those complexities

[13-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i wrote the rpc and html handling directly via tcp calls to the low level port. not sure if it handles ipv6 or not

[13-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is really just for single threaded localhost so i doubt it

[13-Aug-19 03:56 PM] allbits#5898
Not connecting in browser. Console returns expected messages

[13-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
does doing curl to the 100.115.92.205:7771 address work also?

[13-Aug-19 04:01 PM] allbits#5898
Yes

[13-Aug-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the -x option is working!

[13-Aug-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as to why the browser isnt, that seems some sort of system config issue

[13-Aug-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe running as sudo will allow to access localhost?

[13-Aug-19 04:20 PM] allbits#5898
Nope. I'll keep googling around about that
