oh, still need to actually validate notary signatures, but that is pretty easy to do. all these merkle proofs and header ranges was tricky to get lined up right

[08-Jul-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed client side fix for many-utxo spends, it had issues with rate limiting. also it does random selecting of peers to spread the load across all fullnodes

[08-Jul-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV mode is limited to 64 utxo spends

[08-Jul-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this means you might need to consolidate funds

[08-Jul-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
also to verify that all funds are notarized, just spend all funds to yourself to see all 0 in retcodes. just dont broadcast it

Made simple python wallet on top of nSPV for testing: https://github.com/tonymorony/nspv_pywallet

At the moment possible to use on Ubuntu. Very few deps are needed and can be found in README.

Start procedure is simple - put wallet file to the same folder with nSPV komodod (or nSPV komodod to the same folder with wallet files) and execute: `python3 main.py KMD` or `python3 main.py ILN`

yep, countdown

[09-Jul-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
it will try 5 times and stop trying then

[09-Jul-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
do you have KMD daemon already started?

[09-Jul-19 10:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
ok but kmd is not running

[09-Jul-19 10:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
actually maybe i can see the debug file doing something, will kill it and start again

[09-Jul-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
it can say `KMD daemon is not started! Lets try to start` on wide amount of things now as I can see

sent to, received, sent out üëçüèº

[09-Jul-19 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
for example if KMD daemon without nspv support at all started (when nspv_getinfo return error than call doesnt found)

Looks like komodod is running. Once it completes the start process i will kill it and try again

updated client side to fully validate notarizations locally. a bit of signature checking magic. only takes a few seconds extra and this avoids the attack vector of being fed fake tx. now the only validation missing is for KMD rewards amounts

start process of nSPV=1 is about 3 seconds, max

[09-Jul-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, nSPV daemon usually starting/connecting almost instantly and wallet can start daemon only with nSPV=1 param
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator was it easy enough to connect and send tx?

[09-Jul-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i came up with a shortcut way to validate, though it will have problems with pre-dec 15th notarizations

daemon for KMD not started and can't start it. Exiting.

[09-Jul-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I made sure komodod was dead, then i ran that. The first command started komodod

[09-Jul-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
and it's in a folder with komodod from latest jl777 or FSM?
