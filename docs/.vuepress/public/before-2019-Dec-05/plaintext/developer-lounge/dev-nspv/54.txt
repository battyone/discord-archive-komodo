Every time I change something and I want to try I need to wait some time before I can check...

[28-Aug-19 11:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
This is in case of 2 nodes!

[28-Aug-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt need to wait more than a second

[28-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@blackjok3r  After random crashes fix, getting reliably this one:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/JKwZtn7XWz/
`4028    malloc.c: No such file or directory.`
^^ quite strange.

You just need to log in, go to wallet html page and press Update Transaction History.

UPD:
Same scenario, different backtrace:

@blackjok3r There are two different crashes with similair scenario atm:
Updating mempoll transactions on Wallet page
And updating Transaction history.

[28-Aug-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Weird... That was crashing for me every time before... So I fixed the crash on my system and broke it on yours 😂

[28-Aug-19 01:59 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Is image + password log in implemented now?
Or its in WIP status, so shouldn't bother?

[28-Aug-19 01:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was disabled.

[28-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Got it.

[28-Aug-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will enable it again once crashes are sorted out.

[28-Aug-19 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
opnce thing at a time.. or it gets too difficult

[28-Aug-19 02:00 PM] Sir Seven#7158
There are UI problems with it, guess should check after it is enabled again.

[28-Aug-19 02:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, james disabled it to try a fast fix for the crashes... but the crashes were not from that.

[28-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810

yes, dont reenable it. it is still in the html, just hidden

[28-Aug-19 02:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Mihailo which repo/branch you recommend to test your nspv integrations?

[28-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder the .jpg form reappeared... must have messed it up with a merge

[28-Aug-19 02:12 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@jl777c >>yes, dont reenable it. it is still in the html, just hidden

There are situations when it pop-ups and breaks stuff a bit.
Will contact Satinder on it.

[28-Aug-19 02:14 PM] Mihailo#5902
@siu - Chainmakers Use JLs nSPV branch as I PR stuff when I finish them

[28-Aug-19 02:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, luckyly that is what i just compiled

[28-Aug-19 02:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so i can test channels?

[28-Aug-19 02:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, first confusion

[28-Aug-19 02:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just did nspv_login

[28-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, I think it should work. If not, let me know what doesn't work

[28-Aug-19 02:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and when executing channelslist i get ``` ./komodo-cli channelslist
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts you need to nspv_login first

```

[28-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
Have you done login recent, because it expires in 777 seconds

[28-Aug-19 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh, wait... i guess i need to do use some test chain, im running KMD 🤦

[28-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Mihailo#5902
Hahahah

[28-Aug-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, i guess there is some progress

[28-Aug-19 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no actual list tho

[28-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, that is in progress

[28-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Mihailo#5902
Right now

[28-Aug-19 02:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can you send me some NSPV?

@jl777c I merged latest changes from your jl777 branch to mine. couldn't replicate the issue, after trying different steps.

[28-Aug-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
@siu what is the mining diff for NSPV?

[28-Aug-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
change language

[28-Aug-19 02:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna check jl777 repo jl777 branch with fresh clone just to make sure.

[28-Aug-19 02:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[28-Aug-19 02:39 PM] Sir Seven#7158

[28-Aug-19 02:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[28-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c I don't need to wait for a second to use cli, but to get the response from the fullnode it needs some time, it varies from time to time

[28-Aug-19 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to filter the nodes down so that it only requests from  good peers... I have made heaps of changes in libnspv that does this and it works really good now.

[28-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Mihailo#5902
@siu - Chainmakers So I have fixed the list rpc on at least my CCs, but it should work on all. Just on fixed ones it will be fast if there are a lot of CCs of that type on chain.

Thanks a lot for the wallet screenshots @Sir Seven . They are very helpful.

[28-Aug-19 03:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Sir Seven  
I canot reproduce your crash. I have tried compiling with and without degug set, and it does not happen for me. Is there some other steps I need to reproduce it? 
I just started nSPV. and then logged in, and updated an address with 12,000 tx many times, and its working perfectly.

[28-Aug-19 03:59 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm. I do run nspv on custom port. `-p 12900`
But it shouldn't affect wallet this way... as far as i see it.

[28-Aug-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will try it... It may be a system, issue... or something.. maybe compiling the nspv as static wil help?

[28-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Sir Seven#7158

With clean pull, ran onetime script. Started `nspv ILN -p 12900`
Logged in -> pressed Wallet button -> pressed Update (mempool) -> crash
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/R6XJmMW3Jh/

Logged in -> pressed Wallet button -> crash

And stuck there. Now each time i press Wallet it crashes.
Hmm, if that's sys problem, let me check on another device.
A few minutes.

[28-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Sir Seven#7158
After log in you are already on Wallet screen, yet i'm pressing Wallet button. Just in case.

[28-Aug-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok got it. I am on KMD so maybe that is the problem. 🙂

[28-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Weird.

[28-Aug-19 05:03 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c It shouldn't be. I have added a call to mempooltxids so I can filter with txids for SetCCtxids. It wouldn't hurt to just go through the changes to see if it will affect something!

[28-Aug-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but older versions that dont support this new functionality wont work, would it?

[28-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Basically, on nodes that doesn't have this code, the call won't work. But that is it.

[28-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yes

[28-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Mihailo#5902
But the calls are for RPCs so it is not consesus stuff

[28-Aug-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so i dont have to update the fullnodes?

[28-Aug-19 05:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Sir Seven  
No go on ubuntu 16.04 using the copy of your source. Its wokring perfectly.

[28-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c No, it should be fine.

[28-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Mihailo#5902
Just the [cc]list rpc calls won't work

[28-Aug-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
should update version

[28-Aug-19 05:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
any time calls change, otherwise the client gets hung up trying all the nodes it sees.

[28-Aug-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
after sending a bunch of tx it breaks... 
I get a print of `change (null)` and nothig happens
I guess this is what you mean by utxo updating from mempool @jl777c  ?

[28-Aug-19 05:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
an is there any reason the nSPV client cannot just receive the real mempool? rather than needing to request it from full nodes?

[28-Aug-19 05:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It connected to them already and they would just send mempool out to nSPV nodes the same as any other?

[28-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
currently libnspv needs to wait for confirmations to get to a known state, has no concept of mempool when creating tx

[28-Aug-19 05:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it only needs to implement a mempool to have a real mempool

[28-Aug-19 05:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
great... seem to me that would be the proper way to do it

[28-Aug-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[28-Aug-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
then all the mempool requests can query the local mempool

[28-Aug-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
worried about overall network bandwidth though
