Going to take some getting used to

[25-Jul-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
its less than 10,000 lines of code

[25-Jul-19 12:45 PM] SHossain#0007
adoption you mean?

[25-Jul-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
All the functions I usually use are now diffrnet, take many days/.weeks until I know this code base like I do komodod

[25-Jul-19 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said it is much smaller yes

[25-Jul-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
5400 lines of nSPV_*.h code

[25-Jul-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
libbtc stuff is pretty easy to figure out

[25-Jul-19 12:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, most of it is ok, I have a few things to research and mess with but will be ok

[25-Jul-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
5400 lines of code is all the code and half of it is repetitive stuff, so really just a couple thousand lines, experienced blockchain devs can come up to speed in a day, if C is not so strong, then add time to learn enough C

@gcharang nice! dont forget to document how to add new coins to the coins file and how to invoke it for a new coin, also the -p <port> option is quite useful

ancillary things that would be nice would be a cli wrapper that allows cli to issue the curl, and language bindings

[25-Jul-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810

why is the amount of coins in (vin/vout) being called interest?
@jl777c

[25-Jul-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
does the `"isCC":0` tell if the address belongs to a cc module like a 1of2 address or a global address?

[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
that seems likely. Internally, there are some flags/data in transactions that only CC's have, so that looks like a boolean that caches that data instead of the raw hex needing to be analyzed again. Most likely an optimization

there are 2 types of addresses in address index DB

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
normal and CC

[25-Jul-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the purpose of the isCC flag

if it isn't a huge trouble, maybe change interest to rewards?

@jl777c would you say nSPV uses "skip lists" internally at all? What is the most advanced data structure used internally?

[25-Jul-19 02:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
does nSPV use something like this? `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list`

I am not fully sure the relation between MMRs and Skip Lists, but they seem related

@dukeleto on the full node, it does a addressindex lookup and just iterates with if ( i < skipcount) continue

[25-Jul-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
much simpler, look at the code in komodo_nSPV_fullnode.h

If we really want to show off nSPV, we should compare ourselves to that ZIP

[25-Jul-19 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
and tell people how much better our tech is

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
flyclient is good tech

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just a lot more complex

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
Agreed

[25-Jul-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's more general, for chains without DPoW

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
We don't have to attack FlyClient. We can compare + contrast

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a fine solution for non-dPoW chains

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but what year will they finish flyclient?

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I think it's safe to say nSPV was "inspired" by FlyClient, right?

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what about a checkpointed chain liek BCH ? would it work on that?

[25-Jul-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, Benedikt is mostly an academic. He wants papers

[25-Jul-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i thought of it when getting lost in all the flyclient math

[25-Jul-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
so there is no real FlyClient working code, that I can see

[25-Jul-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r a checkpointed chain has the problem of who do you trust to give you the checkpoints

[25-Jul-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
some random node on the internet?

[25-Jul-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r centralized checkpoints help FlyClient. the biggest problems are choosing a valid chain, which dpow solves

[25-Jul-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yeah, the centralized checkpoints could be wrong, but FlyClient needs to know which chain to trust in case of forks/reorgs

[25-Jul-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but I didnt BCH make their chain automatically checkpoint evey 10 blocks? so it would work ther right?

[25-Jul-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
they added a re-org limit of 10, maybe

[25-Jul-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
not automatic checkpoints every 10 blocks, slightly different

[25-Jul-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think they manually add checkpoints often, tho
