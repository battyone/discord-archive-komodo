[04-Sep-19 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so that means it needed to have the ability to make it a static lib which could be used to trigger it's main function via native mobile code written in Java or Kotlin language.

[04-Sep-19 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I heard the similar solution from a local bitcoin dev of GreenAddress who made his app with similar approach.

[04-Sep-19 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder does that require a rooted android?

[04-Sep-19 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Most people don't have access to that

[04-Sep-19 02:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
compiling libnspv on termux? nope

[04-Sep-19 02:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
non-rooted  android also compiles it

[04-Sep-19 02:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
instructions are there on readme for android

[04-Sep-19 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
"readme for android" ?

[04-Sep-19 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
did I miss something?

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] Mihailo#5902
If I remember correctly, you can use .so files in Android app. So libnspv needs to be built as .so library and you can then import it in app.

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
Maybe I am dumb, but I am still not clear on how a Java/kotlin android .apk can use libnspv

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo interesting, seems like a security issue

[04-Sep-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
how does Google verify it's not malware?

[04-Sep-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
run libnspv, then have java issue curl requests?

[04-Sep-19 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c yes, that seems possible

[04-Sep-19 02:49 PM] Mihailo#5902
Don't know about Play Store and its restrictions, I was using app directly on a device.

[04-Sep-19 02:50 PM] Mihailo#5902
JLs solution is easy, you just need to see how to run libnspv on Andriod device...

@Mihailo thanks, i am an android newbie

[04-Sep-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
ah, ok. So google gets submitted the C++ source of the library too, and that is how they can vet for the Play Store

[04-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Mihailo#5902
I'm not so Android dev too, I have done some AOSP modification and rom building but not sure what are all the new stuff in Android world.

[04-Sep-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's all fun and good to get this to work with untrusted .apk's, but the real reason is so average people can install it from the Play Store

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mihailo they are just now releasing android 10 and changing everything again

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems nSPV should be reasonable to use from my android app

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I might be making a first-of-it's-kind. It's not a superlite wallet, nor a full node, nor a light wallet

[04-Sep-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
but a remote-control-for-your-fullnode, which can leverage nSPV data directly from network peers, to provide additional safety in an unsafe environment (mobile phones)

[04-Sep-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
My goal is that nSPV can help in situations where something goes malicious

[04-Sep-19 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i.e., when the full node and phone are not on same local network, this "wormhole" service needs to be used. And I want to design for that service going malicious and phones should be able to notice and disconnect

[04-Sep-19 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
and the plan is to run many wormholes, like electrum servers, to reduce the risk of a single server being so important and a juicy target for attacker

[04-Sep-19 04:16 PM] ca333#0118
@dukeleto yes - i can confirm libNSPV is fully android compatible and we successfully executed a PoC for a atomicDEX mobile nSPV mode.

[04-Sep-19 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 that is awesome to hear

If anyone is curious about the above wallet, I just added the Tor support portion to the code on github.

```Features:
-nSPV wallet for KMD
-Address Book
-Multi themes
-Multiple fiat prices
-Tor enabled price requests
-Manual override Tor Port choice
-Saves all settings on shutdown

from the readme

[27-Sep-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
--disable-wallet --disable-tools are options that the nspv does not follow and maybe it needs some of the wallet functoins as all the nspv api is always supported

[13-Nov-19 09:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Hello.

Build last version of nspv from master

there is an additional returned field that is not specified in https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/nspv.html#getnewaddress

called "seed"

it's what i think ?

[13-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Slyris#2880
It's a string containing numbers separated by a white space

[13-Nov-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
agama/atomicDEX compatible seed, in the specified language

[13-Nov-19 09:46 AM] Slyris#2880
ok great !

[13-Nov-19 09:49 AM] Slyris#2880
In case I want to create my own wallet in a video game, say the first time I start the game. In the idea should save this seed and use it in an existing portfolio, Agama or AtomicDex, is it? possible to import a seed just using nSPV without going through these existing wallets? Is it possible to use only nSPV for the use of the wallet. Consult the funds, spend, transaction history. I saw some call rpc that actually correspond to what I try to do.

[13-Nov-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you can login with any seed or wif

[13-Nov-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it has all the basic rpc calls you need for a wallet

[13-Nov-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you do need to do a spend followed by broadcast, so that is two steps, but this allows for user confirmation
