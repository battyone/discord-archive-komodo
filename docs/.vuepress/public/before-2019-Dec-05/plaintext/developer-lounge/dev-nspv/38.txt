just try it one way and if it doesnt work, the other way

[11-Aug-19 09:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
does this seed node has to be running with nSPV=1 or something?

[11-Aug-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-Aug-19 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is not a good address for seed node

[11-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is my node address and i am not running RICK on it

[11-Aug-19 09:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[11-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, it just needs to be a recent  dev branch or below

[11-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as nSPV=-1 is not set

[11-Aug-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so the default fullnode will support nSPV clients

[11-Aug-19 09:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice!

[11-Aug-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
just launch it normally and you can . use it as a seed

[11-Aug-19 09:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Ok. So if I login to a completely different WIF, and then log back in to the original, then it shows me updated balances and transactions

[11-Aug-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, fixing it now

[11-Aug-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
latest version fixes it

[11-Aug-19 09:33 PM] allbits#5898
I did another send transaction. Hitting refresh but balances not updating and new transaction not showing. Transaction has been confirmed

[11-Aug-19 09:37 PM] allbits#5898
Actually the balance updated fine but not seeing the transaction in the history

almost fits on those 1.44MB floppy

just has to format the floppy a bit to extend it's storage 😄

[11-Aug-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
bootstrap.min.css files are 80% of the html

[11-Aug-19 09:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me see if I can make some custom bootstrap min file a stripped down version from official site. I know they have such tools etc.

[11-Aug-19 09:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
couldn't find it... anyway... already small enough client!

[11-Aug-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits updated so it should refresh the txids on wallet refresh, also i reversed the order so it shows most recent first

[11-Aug-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven html wallet is ready for testing. should be feature complete and so far no known bugs, anything that would make the cli crash, would also make the html wallet crash though

[11-Aug-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
also updated servers with possible fix for skipcount

[11-Aug-19 09:58 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Got it.

[11-Aug-19 10:07 PM] allbits#5898
Yes worked

goes to this by default at 127.0.0.0:7771

[12-Aug-19 09:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
logout, login, refresh and transactions buttons return a page.

[12-Aug-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
login with a new address wif returns same page and tx history as shown in screen above

[12-Aug-19 09:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
info, send, recieve, details, previous page and next page buttons return `{"error":"no method"}`

[12-Aug-19 09:54 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm. On ILN  127.0.0.1:12986 returns `{"error":"no method"}` you should use a valid method like getinfo or getpeers to see web UI.

[12-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Sir Seven#7158
IE `http://127.0.0.1:12986/api/method/getinfo`

[12-Aug-19 09:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeap, that returns valid json

[12-Aug-19 10:03 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm. Just to be sure, are you checking latest version from jl777 branch?

[12-Aug-19 10:04 AM] Sir Seven#7158
UI hass different layout for me.

[12-Aug-19 10:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah I had old version, did git pull and make clean. after that, rm -rf'd it, and cloned new. not jl777 branch tho, copy pasted from @jl777c post in #talk-general

{Reactions}
👌 

[12-Aug-19 10:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I see now it's been updated to use that branch, will try again 👍🏼

[12-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
just pushed update to all branches, they are all the same now

[12-Aug-19 10:24 AM] Sir Seven#7158
There are some inconsistences uing old calls like   ` http://127.0.0.1:$port/api/method/$method/$params`

Like getpeerinfo or getinfo returns UI page for it:

And some api methods just return json

[12-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i need to fix the api path to just return the json

[12-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
fixing

[12-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yep.

[12-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Sir Seven#7158
The biggest problem for now from my point.

[12-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed possible fix

[12-Aug-19 10:33 AM] Sir Seven#7158
WebUI works good, no issues with presented functionality.
A few notes/thoughts:

- just opening `http://127.0.0.1:$port/` always opens `To continue, log in to your account.` page. Even if you are logged in.
- will be nice to have help page and/or api decription page
- there is no options to call `stop` from webUI, or I just can't find one :)
- no mempool either
- spending has a nice flow: create prototype -> revize -> create tx -> broadcast, but just broadcast field looks weird on info page. Quite counter-intuitive.

[12-Aug-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
broadcast field is at the bottom of the page, most people wont even see it

[12-Aug-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
mempool requests will create a lot of load

[12-Aug-19 10:35 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Logout is a separarte button on top. shouldn't it be inside Account page?

make a help page and i can display it

[12-Aug-19 10:36 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Ok.

[12-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the login/logout/index is a bit of a kludge

[12-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
just a side effect of not having enough time to get all the kinks out

[12-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no stop from GUI

[12-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the memory and CPU usage is quite low

[12-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway the html templates are there, feel free to make PR with improved appearance, help, etc.

[12-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
change in control flow will require some changes in the C code

[12-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i had the logout button in the upper right to allow instant logout, in case time is urgent

[12-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it wipes all the data from RAM

[12-Aug-19 10:39 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Got it.

[12-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i think better text can fix most all your issues

[12-Aug-19 10:39 AM] Sir Seven#7158
The memory and CPU usage is pretty much too low. :)

[12-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is so far down the list of processes, i dont think people will complain it is running

[12-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is no installer

[12-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is some installer that makes the install process easy which can have a stop function

[12-Aug-19 10:42 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Oh. One more note:
Going to account page, each time generates new addr. It's not a problem, just feels strange.

[12-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can make some screenshots of the flow

[12-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i actually like it, it goes fast enough you can generate lots of addresses quickly

[12-Aug-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is a way to hide that part until the generate new address button is clicked

[12-Aug-19 10:48 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Latest commit fixed processing of `/api/method/` calls.
WIth one problem:
opening `http://127.0.0.1:port/` returns `{"error":"no method"}` now.

[12-Aug-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
that syntax is invalid

[12-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Ops. Typo

[12-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i see what you mean, investigating

[12-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Correct link looks like `http://127.0.0.1:port/method/index?`

[12-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it should work from root too, fixing

[12-Aug-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
