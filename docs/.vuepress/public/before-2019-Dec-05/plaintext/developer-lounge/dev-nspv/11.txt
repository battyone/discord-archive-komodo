retcode 0 means it is already in the mempool (on the fullnode)

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, I see

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
are you sure it isnt already broadcast?

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
1 means added to mempool and broadcasted

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
no, it's not

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
-1 means some sort of error on the fullnode side

[07-Jul-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
-2 means timeout

[07-Jul-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
do you have some txs in mempool on `5.9.102.210` ?

[07-Jul-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
no, adding prints for the fullnode and restarting

[07-Jul-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we can then see if the tx is even getting to the 102.210 node

[07-Jul-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
look where the "amount too smal" error is, it didnt get past rpc

[07-Jul-19 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i see the tx got recv

[07-Jul-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the error detection is not very good... it sent it so it thinks it was good, even though it was rejected by mempool

[07-Jul-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you get a 0 on the first broadcast, that does mean a failure

[07-Jul-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i added print in the rpc to see what satoshis it came up with, it thought it was less than 10000

[07-Jul-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
aha, now after one `retcode: 0` broadcast getting again (generated new hex by spend) ```error code: -1
