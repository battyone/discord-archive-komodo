just add stuff to the existing wallet page

@jl777c pushed update for wallet page

[13-Aug-19 12:14 PM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c what does the `services` key in getpeerinfo's response mean?
```
  {
    "nodeid": 54,

  },
```

[13-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be 70000005 (not sure how many 0s)

[13-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the 7 means nSPV support with both addressindex and spent index

[13-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
that node appears to be returning some random value

[13-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
are you running latest version, i fixed the services field recently

[13-Aug-19 12:25 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, I built libnspv, branch - jl777    3 hours back
most of the nodes are sending the same value: 1073741829
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/6Zh2Y9WvG9/

will build again and check

[13-Aug-19 12:28 PM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c getting the same response as before

[13-Aug-19 12:29 PM] gcharang#6833
the html ui is giving a different response

[13-Aug-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
the html ui value is correct

[13-Aug-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang the difference is decimal in the api output, gui is displaying in hex

[13-Aug-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
they are the same numbers

[13-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder is there a way to add a ?update=1 and ?refresh=1 value to the wallet url depending on which button was pressed? Also the "Mempool Transactions" should be "Unconfirmed Transactions".

[13-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
"Dest. Addr" -> "Destination"

[13-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
would be good to line up the Amount and Txid columns with the "Transaction history" rows if possible

[13-Aug-19 01:01 PM] gcharang#6833
got it
so services starting with 7 means nSPV support with both addressindex and spent index
starting with 4? just nspv with no addressindex and spent index ?
ending with 5?

[13-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[13-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
5 is the normal nServices value for fullnodes

[13-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder can we hyperlink the txid in the vin array?

[13-Aug-19 01:02 PM] gcharang#6833
got it

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator could you run that Hush nspv script again?

[13-Aug-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator i will try again soon myself, but now the main Hush seed node should be running the latest nSPV code

[13-Aug-19 01:59 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can try, need a sync'd node IP that is ready tho. I've begun syncing on one of my servers

[13-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Currently web version and API work fine.
No error pages yet.

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @dukeleto  if you can provide me with good node IP, i can add HUSH to automated tests for libnspv.

[13-Aug-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator i am restarting the hush seed node with very latest FSM code right now

[13-Aug-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
and we are now on the very latest FSM code as of 3 minutes ago

the dev cycle is so fast with such little code size

[13-Aug-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
only libevent and libsodium are external libs, the rest is all source code in the libnspv repo

[13-Aug-19 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits which kind of linux on chromebook? crouton?

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
include the html server, rpc handler and json processing

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
install automake

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits you need to install all the dev libs via apt-get

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
google whenever there is a missing package, 99% of time it tells you what package you need

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
which are listed in README

[13-Aug-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
copy+paste the apt-get line from README.md works too üòÉ

[13-Aug-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty cool that a superlite wallet can talk to the mempool

[13-Aug-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't remember Electrum having any features like that, when I used it

[13-Aug-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
nspv has a lot more capability than electrum. skipcount alone enables it to handle addresses with very large number of utxo, though no client takes advantage of that yet

[13-Aug-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you can search mempool for whether a specific utxo was spent in it, or if a specific address has received funds

[13-Aug-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, it also has an html wallet (and api) built in and runs locally, sort of big features

[13-Aug-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you look at the superlite gui, you will see that txid are hyperlinked and it displays all vins/vouts, with the vin txid hyperlinked

[13-Aug-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so while it isnt a full block explorer, you can track down all the relevant details of your tx

[13-Aug-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and it does it in reasonable performance. though if there is only one nSPV fullnode, that will be a bottleneck as there is a rate limiter of 1 nspv message per second per peer, for each message type

[13-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
as you add more nodes with latest FSM branch, then make sure they connect to the seed node so they automatically propagate to the superlites

[13-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
or add more seed nodes if they are not cross connected with the main seed. though always good to have a handful of seed nodes

[13-Aug-19 02:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c what is so exciting about this, is that a superlite client can do blockchain analysis and not have to trust a 3rd party explorer

[13-Aug-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried to make the GUI as fast as possible, while still keeping the internals single threaded

[13-Aug-19 02:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
just one aspect, but that excites me. We all trust explorers way too much

[13-Aug-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[13-Aug-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible that your peer is not up to date, but the Peers page will show the status of each, so if a specific request doesnt complete or has missing data, just refresh the page

[13-Aug-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be working the same in unix and osx, but havent heard if it works with windows yet
