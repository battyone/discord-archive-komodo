HTML is not as cool on mobile screen, but it can be improved I think

[13-Aug-19 10:37 PM] CMaurice#1685
yepyep, might even be worth ui just for mobile

[13-Aug-19 10:37 PM] SHossain#0007
This is great. Can't wait to test this on my phone when I'm back home.

[13-Aug-19 10:38 PM] SHossain#0007
Great job!

[13-Aug-19 10:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c @dukeleto I couldn't find a way to block running JS on HTML page. Maybe that SHA256 sum pages serving is solution, or theere can be a C code which strips the <script> </script> tags which are only for Js

[13-Aug-19 10:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

I will fix  the css snd UI for mobile screen. Wait for that update. üòé

[14-Aug-19 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'none'; object-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'; child-src 'none' ` is what I have cooked up, which tells all modern browsers to disable all JS, iframes, plugin objects and background worker processes

[14-Aug-19 02:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
whatever prints out the HTML interface needs to put that as an HTTP header

[14-Aug-19 02:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
and that should greatly increase the security of the HTML UI, from browser-based attacks from the OS or browser being infected with malware that injects code into pages/etc

[14-Aug-19 02:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c the security is opt-in, the newer the browser, the more secure. Crazy old browsers don't know about CSP or enforce it, but that is not who we care about anyway

[14-Aug-19 02:53 AM] dukeleto#7326

merged. also added the content security. now rewards is displayed for non-KMD

[14-Aug-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
also the txid list now has the headers on each line. is that intentional?

[14-Aug-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems libnspv is running on most everything so far, just the chromebook browser issue and windows is unconfirmed

[14-Aug-19 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me check

[14-Aug-19 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
rewards are hiding to show if I use ILN

[14-Aug-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
tx history is now showing the heading for the value, as I removed the table columns and just using single row and using <div> tags to manage the resizing of the screen.

[14-Aug-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so this is needed for mobile. i guess it is ok

[14-Aug-19 08:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[14-Aug-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
for ILN i see the rewards

[14-Aug-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
how does it look on mobile now?

[14-Aug-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
can you test the new content security header?

[14-Aug-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you can modify the template to add JS, but it should not allow it

[14-Aug-19 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I see what you were saying about the menu buttons

[14-Aug-19 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for some reason those are not taking CSS style on mobile browser, using DuckDuckGo browser on Android.

[14-Aug-19 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but on Desktop FireFox, works perfectly fine.

[14-Aug-19 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@CMaurice can you make a PR to the readme in libnspv so we can have the instructions on how to build for android

for txinfo, we might want to put the vin/vout above the hex outputs, which really dont help most users

antara logo is too big

[14-Aug-19 08:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, coz address form is no more statically set to width

[14-Aug-19 08:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I do that the resizing messes up the rendering

awesome - we will certainly get a mobile wallet up for libnspv - maybe even add a "nSPV mode" to the atomicDEX wallet.

[14-Aug-19 08:44 AM] ca333#0118
@alperC @Audo @Daniel CP plz check infos posted above, arrange a blogpost or so and share through SM. This is basically a successful PoC for mobile (actually platform independent) nSPV and a huge step. Mobile Dapps, wallets - even mobile games can easily integrate Komodo and other Smart Chains with libnspv.

it appears to work on all the systems we tried it on. just windows and chromebook browser config, windows just seems to be nobody tried a build yet

[14-Aug-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder i added a total received and total sent (network bytes) fields to the getinfo response. Can you add that to the getinfo page. this way we can see how much bandwidth is being used

[14-Aug-19 08:48 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@jl777c  Actually tried api and curl on WIndows - works well.
Hasn't check browser UI yet.

[14-Aug-19 08:48 AM] CMaurice#1685
yep, will do. Also want to look into running under tor on Android. Should I expect any problems, exit nodes are just IPs, right?

[14-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt add any special tor support, but didnt disable it, so it is up to tor to be compatible

[14-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven good that it functions on windows, but the html is what might have the issues more than the low level code

[14-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder did you verify the anti-JS header works?

[14-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
not being able to see the entire address in the send field is not good... needs to be fixed

[14-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r can you reduce the bandwidth being used for headers? maybe once all nodes go into sync, it can reduce the frequency to when there is a new block detected? outbound bandwidth after several minutes is 1044 bytes, inbound is 240kb and it is just sitting idle

for me ILN is not showing any HTML tags regarding Rwards.

[14-Aug-19 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
moved TX-vin/vout on top

[14-Aug-19 08:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that okay?

[14-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is more useful this way

[14-Aug-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r even without any new blocks coming in, inbound data went up to 320kb now. so i think that is one optimization, but likely it is possible to reduce bandwidth usage even more?

[14-Aug-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven were you able to verify the mempool (Unconfirmed Transactions) display via the update button

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

[14-Aug-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the typical easy to use html GUI, but it has only static html that is generated internally from within the nspv C code

[14-Aug-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses localhost, which makes this nearly as secure as using cli and unlike all the other html wallets, there is no extra layer of code, certainly no node.js
