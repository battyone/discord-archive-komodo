got it

[24-Jul-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i also changed the default chain to be KMD

[24-Jul-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is not in all branches yet

[24-Jul-19 07:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Hello

[24-Jul-19 07:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Still following the advancement, great job @jl777c what are the next steps ?

[24-Jul-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is basically feature complete, just waiting on the merkleproof code from dimxy. i guess to make sure it builds on windows and bug fixing, though not heard of any bugs yet

[24-Jul-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to make a dynamically generated static html wallet, basically the nspv executable would generate html to reflect the current state and allow basic operations, but i need html templates to use

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and documentations

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok great !

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Sound's really great

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems ready to use, so little code and only dependencies are libevent and libsodium

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you have bench any performance yet ?

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Libsodium work on windows ?

[24-Jul-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
99% of time depends on how long it takes for network response

[24-Jul-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so performance depends on network connections and the fullnodes you connect to

[24-Jul-19 07:23 AM] Slyris#2880
It's mingw by the way I hope it's will work well

[24-Jul-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, also need to figure out how to dynamically add peers. i have a list of new peers but havent figured out how to make it active

[24-Jul-19 08:33 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Can someone pls confirm syntax for nspv in browser? I'm getting expected result in console, but browser returns `{"error":"no method"}`

What tool is it for browser?

[24-Jul-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
http://127.0.0.1:12345/?{"method":"getinfo"}

[24-Jul-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
just construct url with http://... i guess you can make bookmarks or a simple html page

[24-Jul-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
using static html without javascript should be quite secure to 127.0.0.1

[24-Jul-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know if it works

[24-Jul-19 08:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c the exact url you have posted (with the port corrected)
gives

Chrome:
```
This page isn‚Äôt working 
127.0.0.1 sent an invalid response.
ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE

Firefox:

{"error":"no method"}
```

[24-Jul-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you used the right port for the nspv running?

[24-Jul-19 08:58 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[24-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder said it worked for him

[24-Jul-19 09:06 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm using firefox, sill getting no method error.  Console debugger says maybe char encoding err.

wil try opera

[24-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe use {

[24-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
instead of %7B

[24-Jul-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i might need to return some html headers info

try that

[24-Jul-19 09:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
still no mothdo ü§∑üèº 
addressbar seems to transalate to { } automatically, headers sounds like whats needed.
I might change track and see how it goes via django + html templates

[24-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
its just returning raw json, if you add /api it should return a header saying it is returning json

[24-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it is a matter to construct the right way for the args

[24-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i think args can be added with ? & syntax

[24-Jul-19 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
http://127.0.0.1:7771/api/method/getinfo/height/777 
returns result

[24-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
its been years since i did this code, i think there are many ways to get the params into the api processor

[24-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
after method, pairs of height/777 will make key:value for the json

[24-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it is all converted to a JSON request that is the same as via curl

[24-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
at least we can now have browser based interactions with nSPV api

[24-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so run ./nspv, click a bunch of localhost urls to do wallet functions

[24-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a way to use POST to do the api request, it avoids the problem

[24-Jul-19 09:29 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll work on doing via django form, that'll post to python and allow for soem gui tempating

[24-Jul-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, POSTing data will prevent it from appearing in any local caches, good idea

[24-Jul-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
Looking for alpha-testers for nSPV + HUSH, and will pay bounties for testing/etc. I figure most people interested are in this room. Later today I will post details of public HUSH nSPV servers that can be used. I would also be interested in HUSH spearheading the writing of more tests + docs for nSPV, and HUSH can provide bounties in additional to any other projects that might want to

[24-Jul-19 04:27 PM] allbits#5898
Any use if a cli noob helps test. I'm not looking for bounties, just fun

[24-Jul-19 04:28 PM] allbits#5898
I already did a bit of nspv with komodo

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
sure

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you get to use curl, or form 127.0.0.1 url

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
just updated to a new nSPV protocol that supports more CC

[24-Jul-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv doesnt support CC, but it needs to match the fullnode side to be compatible

[24-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
also now all validations are active and it is indeed properly validating the merkleproof for the utxo txid

[24-Jul-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
@dukeleto @SHossain you need to update

[24-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i think with the merkle proof implemented along with a decent number of CC, the core protocol should stabilize, so i hope there wont be (m)any more protocol changes

[24-Jul-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the nSPV code is limited to the nSPV, jl777 and FSM branches for komodod

[24-Jul-19 06:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
thanks, latest `FSM` branch is merged into HUSH `duke` branch

[24-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the browser REST like interface is working, so this will be a very easy way to install a wallet

[24-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just run nspv and open a local page with localhost url

[24-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and if the html has no javascript, the it should be as secure as a cli wallet as traffic to 127.0.0.1 does not go to the network

[24-Jul-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just need to POST any wif and/or clear browser history

[24-Jul-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0% CPU 3.1MB

[24-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
so 300x nspv processes per GB of RAM, literally thousands of instances per node would be possible

[24-Jul-19 06:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty amazing

[24-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a feeling nspv will open up some new possibilities

[24-Jul-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it also might even work on a 32 bit CPU

[24-Jul-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
or even 16 bit, as long as the int64_t type is supported

[24-Jul-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
nSPV brings superlite wallets to some very resource-constrained devices

[24-Jul-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
fascinating stuff

[24-Jul-19 07:17 PM] allbits#5898
What should I be downloading to test hush nspv?

[24-Jul-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
best to start with KMD

[24-Jul-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
clone my nspv repo

[24-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
./autogen.sh

[24-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
./configure

[24-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
make

[24-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
./nspv

[24-Jul-19 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
now you can issue curl commands as in ~/src/tools/testvectors

[24-Jul-19 07:34 PM] allbits#5898
K. I'll look at this when I get back to keyboard. Open to stupid noob questions when I do?

[24-Jul-19 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
of course

[24-Jul-19 08:38 PM] CMaurice#1685
compiled and working on sid with libevent-dev and libsodium-dev `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7771" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"stop\"}"

Peer propagation seems to work, but not sure if it may break somehthing else. Had to filter already known IPs otherwise it just filled it with dupes.

Will be quite a bit of work to add CC tx to this, but I think it can be done without that much effort.
