if there are a million nspv nodes, all needing to get all unconfirmed tx...

[28-Aug-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a giant load on the network

[28-Aug-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the design reason why the fullnodes do mempool scanning, to avoid the nspv nodes from having to relay unconfirmed tx

[28-Aug-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes a realiable utxo cache, and a local mempool will help a lot. 
mempool might be a pretty big job lol. It needs to be done from scratch in C right?

[28-Aug-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so when the overall network bandwidth is taken into consideration, that changes the optimal answer from having a local mempool to offloading it to the fullnodes

[28-Aug-19 05:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[28-Aug-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
as you have experienced with bandwidth efficient header sync, the problem becomes orders of magnitude harder than just brute forcing requests to update local state

[28-Aug-19 05:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea for nspv is to get to where a few thousand full nodes can comfortable support millions of nspv superlite clients

[28-Aug-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the design priority. imagine we have 9600 baud modem connections and treat the bandwidth as a very precious resource

[28-Aug-19 05:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got it. üôÇ 
mempool could be returned with the getinfo call if it was supplied the address? 
This should make it very easy to do.

[28-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
there is already a  mempool message

[28-Aug-19 05:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because nSPVC doesnt care about any other address

[28-Aug-19 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it has a function id and other parameters to use for searching

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
recommend to use the existing calls as mihailo is using it for CC tx creation

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Is libnspv follwoing changes on Komodo nSPV or ?

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and certainly querying for an address in mempool is already done

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[28-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo that is the goal, but so far not even faucetget is implemented yet

[28-Aug-19 05:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe its another bug that I have ran into.. 
after I spend a bunch of utxos... it refuses to make more tx, but the "wallet" page shows all txids and utxos just fine, evenm from mempool

[28-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
BTW, when I said to @siu - Chainmakers and others that CC is working, I meant on komodod. Haven't check libnspv!

[28-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Mihailo#5902
Should I work on libnspv to make CC work too?

[28-Aug-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
after we solve what needs to be done for finalizecctx equivalent and have a plan on how to port all the CC rpc to libnspv

[28-Aug-19 05:44 PM] Mihailo#5902
Ok!

[28-Aug-19 07:59 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Got how to get 'fullnode not response' state JL777 mentioned.
It's a problem on libnspv client side it seems. Will provide all info to blackjok3r.
Does not reproduce on komodod -nSPV=1 instances.

about 5 seconds, maybe more

[28-Aug-19 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can i get some NSPV?

[28-Aug-19 08:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i could mine them, but prefer not to load the whole chain if what i want is just test nspv mode.

[28-Aug-19 08:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no worries, i downloaded it on another server

[28-Aug-19 08:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i was able to execute a faucetget on nspv

[28-Aug-19 08:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@siu - Chainmakers You must compile komodo in testmode otherwise you must wait 100 blocks until tx is confirmed.

[28-Aug-19 09:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
There is the command how to do it in cc-general pinned I think

[28-Aug-19 09:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, thanks.

[29-Aug-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
Is there a way to visualize to the user, how much bandwidth the current wallet "connection" has used?

[29-Aug-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
Might be useful for people that are using pre-paid internet plans with a fixed bandwith limit

[29-Aug-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo call shows network bytes received and sent

[29-Aug-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
displayed on the html info page, latest version is looking really good, less than 1MB after 4+ hrs

@jl777c @Mihailo 
I've run a script to find the rpc that crash komdod in the -nSPV=1 mode
```
assetchainproof
getrawtransaction
zcsamplejoinsplit
```
all of these crash with
```
error: couldn't connect to server: EOF reached (code 1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)
```

[30-Aug-19 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
only those three?

[30-Aug-19 05:43 PM] gcharang#6833
these three crash the daemon
I haven't checked for other types of errors or outputs that make no sense

[30-Aug-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it doesnt crash, it seems ok for the non-nspv rpc

[30-Aug-19 05:58 PM] gcharang#6833
agreed
after the cc are working, may be the non-nspv rpc could return "Disabled"

[30-Aug-19 10:46 PM] Mihailo#5902
@gcharang I'll take a look at them on monday, maybe it will be quick fix!

probably just to return error if nSPV=1

it'd be nice to see if libnspv can be compiled with emscripten and run in a browser

[31-Aug-19 08:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Hi, does `Create secure login image` (CREATE_LOGIN_IMG) still require translation?

[02-Sep-19 08:09 AM] CrisF#3405
I seem to remember seeing that steganography might not be used...

[02-Sep-19 08:09 AM] CrisF#3405
@grewalsatinder

[02-Sep-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
for now it is disabled, but if not too much trouble, might as well translate it

[02-Sep-19 08:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Great thanks.

[02-Sep-19 08:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Be nice if there was a way to securely add it.  It's one of the features that I was interested in when I first came here, but nobody ever talked about.

[02-Sep-19 08:37 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm wondering how to have `Transaction Height` translated. 
Could someone please tell me what is it?

[02-Sep-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the height the txid was confirmed in

[02-Sep-19 08:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks you üôè

[02-Sep-19 08:48 AM] CrisF#3405
Sorry, couple more questions:
Does `height` in 'the height the txid was confirmed in' mean block?
What is `Transaction Length`?

[02-Sep-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
height is the block height yes, and tranmsaction lenght is the size of the tx in bytes I think.

[02-Sep-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[02-Sep-19 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Sep-19 12:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi,
Made a PR (#131) for Japanese translation.
Still have 2 questions though.  Will add to translation later.

1.  What is "Best Known Height" from `{ "BEST_HEIGHT": "Best Known Height"}`?  (left as English for now)

2.  What is `vini` from `"SPENT_VINI"`?  Found `spentvini` as "the input number of this output in the transaction that spent it" but a clear term in Japanese would help understanding.  Currently translated as `ÈÄÅ‰ø°vini`.

[03-Sep-19 12:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
best known height is the last header that the client seen from that peer that links back to the last notarization (validated) 
1 coin }
2 coin    ---> 6 coins 
3coin }
vin[0] = 1 
vin[1] = 2 
vin[2] = 3 
0,1,2 is i

[03-Sep-19 12:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, ok, thanks üëç

[03-Sep-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am working on this Android app that connects to a full node, and I am wondering, how can I leverage some nSPV data, so that the app connecting to a full node doesn't actually have to fully "trust" that node? Is it possible to look at nSPV data and detect a malicious node giving false info? @jl777c

[03-Sep-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you can validate specific txids

[03-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not trying to make a superlite wallet, but maybe leverage some of the data

[03-Sep-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
you can also verify if a node is on the mainchain

[03-Sep-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
interesting

[03-Sep-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c my app would need to send p2p messages to an nSPV-enabled full node, correct?

[03-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
this isn't in RPC-world

[03-Sep-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
unfortunately the mobile app is Kotlin and the backend service is Java. Using libnspv might be "fun"

[03-Sep-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
can you issue curl requests?

[04-Sep-19 02:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[04-Sep-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can just issue api calls to libnspv, it will need to run as its own process

[04-Sep-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe we need a special android build of libnspv, because android cannot run arbitrary executables. They need to be in .apk format

[04-Sep-19 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ca333 maybe can share idea of turning it to an android app module etc.

[04-Sep-19 01:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or @artem.pikulin

[04-Sep-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
basically, how can Android apps leverage some nSPV data? We probably need to make an android app/library helper for libnspv. It' can't be compiled and used directly

[04-Sep-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly it would be a wrapper around talking to full nodes via HTTP requests and parsing results

[04-Sep-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
we could probably get more android adoption if we make it easy for people

[04-Sep-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
i heard it built for android

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it can be compiled as executable binary which needs to be exected from termux app.

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but if an app needs to be built, that might not be done similarly.

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I done such trials from `iguana` android test days.

[04-Sep-19 02:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
wasn't working for me

[04-Sep-19 02:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the executable doesn't give the API or don't executed in the secure sandboxed environment if I understand correctly.
