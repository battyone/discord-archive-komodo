network bandwidth usage is relatively low, but we can reduce it further

[14-Aug-19 09:12 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@jl777c skipcount works, i believe the issue is closed.
38vin transaction generation do not crash libnspv for me atm.
Yet I got random crashes on broadcast. Either webUI or api. Trying to see what's up with it atm.

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder <span class="col-lg-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12" style="display: none;"><b>Rewards:</b><br> 0.00000000 ILN</span>

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it shows display: none, but still the Rewards is being displayed. this started with the mobile PR

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will go out in the HTML tags, but won't display.

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
display: none; means hidden.

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
yet, i can see it

[14-Aug-19 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
display: ; means unhidden

[14-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
does anybody else see the Rewards: 0.000000 ILN, displayed for non-KMD coins?

[14-Aug-19 09:14 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Oh. Forgot to close the issue for skipcount.

[14-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
with latest, even the amount might show up, just for the last mempool tx though

[14-Aug-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven if broadcast is crashing, likely it relates to the size of the hex

[14-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@alperC i think the initial nSPV post is very good about the low level workings, but the second post should be about the accessibility and ease of onboarding new users is. this centers on its ability to run on a wide variety of platforms and having the html GUI that isnt sacrificing security

[14-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
using the browser, does open it up to clipboard replacing malware and keyloggers at the browser level, so it isnt quite as secure as cli, but other than that, the security exposure is essentially the same as cli as it is the cli program that is generating the html

[14-Aug-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and nSPV in general is almost at the same security level as a fullnode, there is the reliance on other nodes to tell it what utxo you have. this can be mitigated by tracking locally the utxo the address has, but the initial version of superlite wallet uses no HDD storage at all. nothing is on HDD, all in RAM

[14-Aug-19 09:23 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`http://127.0.0.1:7771/method/login?wif=WIF_GOES_HERE` is also potentially exposed in browser history if not cleared.

[14-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, @grewalsatinder can we change that to a POST?

[14-Aug-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to remove this browser history exposure

sure

[14-Aug-19 09:24 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yep. 30+ inputs generate a huge hex to broadcast.
And  it goes down with buffer overflow on broadcast.
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/89fVX2gbnf/

[14-Aug-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
this is via curl?

[14-Aug-19 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I see that I had not did git pull, is seeing those rewards now

[14-Aug-19 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
pushing all those fixies

[14-Aug-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, plz see if curl crashes with big broadcast

adding custom <script> tag also not loading

üòÉ

[14-Aug-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  yes. I had tried it before. When it gets the headers to only fetch one. It fell out of sync. Didnt spend much time on it though

[14-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it is currently a bandwidth hog, relatively speaking

[14-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully you can reduce its usage 10x

[14-Aug-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes it is wasteful

[14-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven pushed fix for broadcast crash

[14-Aug-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can have a go at it tomorrow.

[14-Aug-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
ok. one simple way is to just start the process if the Peers page is loaded. and then stop once we get the peers in sync

[14-Aug-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
in most cases, even if a peer is out of sync, it isnt a giant disaster. i guess might need to prune nodes during the spend call

[14-Aug-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think if we have the latest header, and it linkc back, there is no reason to need this header from all nodes really

[14-Aug-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly

[14-Aug-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just doing numpeers more work than needed, and always doing it, even when no new blocks are coming in

[14-Aug-19 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I moved the HTML variable `$REWARDS_DISPLAY_KMD` to custom.css file

[14-Aug-19 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's not taking it's value update there

[14-Aug-19 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you please fix that?

[14-Aug-19 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like I said I did try to slow it down before, SO I know where to start

[14-Aug-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok. there is now the totalsent/totalrecv fields in getinfo so you can see how much bandwidth it is eating

{Reactions}
üëç 

[14-Aug-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven update again, pushed another fix

[14-Aug-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder what do i have to do to fix it?

[14-Aug-19 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no worries, I think I can find a work around. just a sec.

[14-Aug-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c work around didn't work. inline css style comes under the security policy applied for some reason.

[14-Aug-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I defined the `$REWARDS_DISPLAY_KMD` in custom.css file

[14-Aug-19 09:40 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Oh. Just rechecked with api - it crashes.
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/rz3BKd3Rgd/
Not yet updated.

[14-Aug-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right now if key word `$REWARDS_DISPLAY_KMD` is in HTML it is replaced with none.

[14-Aug-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but if it's in custom.css it it's not.

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but for me, it did replace it properly, it still had no effect

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i posted you the html it generated

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
<span class="col-lg-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12" style="display: none;"><b>Rewards:</b><br> 0.00000000 ILN</span>

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, that's because some latest security policy

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's inline style within tag

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is replacing it

[14-Aug-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm moving it to a custom.css class

[14-Aug-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so html will only refer to now that css class in custom.css file

[14-Aug-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like this
```<span class="col-lg-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12 rewards"><b>Rewards:</b><br> $REWARDS $COIN</span>```

[14-Aug-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
rewards css class

[14-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
this is lower priority than changing the login to a POST

[14-Aug-19 09:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[14-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Rebuilt nspv with latest jl777 branch.
Still crashes on huge hex broadcast.

[14-Aug-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how big is the hex?

[14-Aug-19 09:45 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Sent it in PM.

[14-Aug-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will try to duplicate

[14-Aug-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
its not that big...

[14-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it worked for me

[14-Aug-19 09:48 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm.

[14-Aug-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure you have latest jl777 branch and get me the backtrace

With api/mehtod/broadcast/hex from browser.

[14-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
plz try with curl

[14-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this separates the problem from the low level vs html processing

[14-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there is a limit to the size of GET data on url

[14-Aug-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just broadcast the same hex

[14-Aug-19 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
