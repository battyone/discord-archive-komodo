And we're using `b2` to build Boost ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/d30c4295805ca39211d5a680a5ddb7494d9afdf2/mm2src/common/build.rs#L699 ). Had less luck with CMake.

@siu - Chainmakers Above was mentioned that libnpv builds on rasppi with no issues. You might want to try it instead.

[20-Aug-19 08:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I built it, but cant seem to make it run...

[20-Aug-19 08:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I cant see anything on browser on port 7771

[20-Aug-19 09:55 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@siu - Chainmakers 
Try curl from terminal:
`curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/`
And check there is process listnening on 7771 port:
`ss -tlnp | grep 7771`

[20-Aug-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers ZEC is not compatible to be compiled on rasp pi, which is why KMD is not compat. It's not ever gonna happen

[20-Aug-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
so just get better hardware üôÇ

[20-Aug-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
64bit OS is preferred, raspian is 32bit broken-ness

@siu - Chainmakers libnspv works on 32bit, but komodod wont. well i guess in nSPV=1 mode it might be possible to make it work, but would be a LOT of work and since libnspv already works, there seems little point

[20-Aug-19 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL the flavor of ARM that it is doesn't play nice with zcash dependencies, iirc. There are very good reasons when radix42 says something ain't gonna work üôÇ

[20-Aug-19 04:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Unless you got it to actually work, I wouldn't assume

[20-Aug-19 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
rasppi is ARMv7, i.e. many things are emulated in software or don't even exist, where ARMv8 is drastically better

[20-Aug-19 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
rasp pi is just not worth the money, it's meant to be simple+easy with lots of "batteries included" stuff for students

[20-Aug-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's not for dev'ing

[20-Aug-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
additionally, the OS they give people to run on it, it's highly de-optimized

[20-Aug-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
32bit OS, for 64bit hardware, lulz

that has 6 cores, more than the pirate chest version

[20-Aug-19 04:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
and runs armbian nicely

[20-Aug-19 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure, but maybe AES primitives are missing on ARMv7

[20-Aug-19 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326

[20-Aug-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think you will find that nobody has ever gotten Zcash running on any type of rasppi, if you do, let me know!

[20-Aug-19 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
If it's not ARMv8, it's not worth working on the HW, imho

can someone make a PR with instructions on how to add the proper lines to the coins file so nspv will work with a coin

[20-Aug-19 05:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
would be nice!

[20-Aug-19 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i explained it already, but probably good to have a more detailed explanation

[20-Aug-19 05:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have not scrolled much above. Sorry. Just wanted to test this.

[20-Aug-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so far, not so many bugs. it just seems to work

[20-Aug-19 05:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sorry if it sounds incompetent, but how would i start the ./nspv KMD file to be accessed from LAN ip?

[20-Aug-19 05:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like i cant access the web wallet from the LAN ip

[20-Aug-19 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure you need an external ip address. it is in libbtc the networking code

[20-Aug-19 06:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[20-Aug-19 06:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i was thinking on just the LAN network

[20-Aug-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if the fullnode can accept connections on the LAN ip, it might work

[20-Aug-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe need to -bind=LANip on the fullnode side?

[20-Aug-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and you need to add the LANip peer, which currently is not possible via api, will need to make an addnode api later this week

[20-Aug-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
for non-KMD coins, you can change the "nSPV" parameter in the coins file

[20-Aug-19 06:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like there is something off with the wallet seed encoding

[20-Aug-19 06:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I tried a seed generate from atomic dex but printed a different address

[20-Aug-19 06:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
By the way i think it might be easier since i just want to access the wallet interface through a browser in a different device, not the lib itself.

[20-Aug-19 06:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not sure if im being clear

[20-Aug-19 06:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I want to run it as a website. Or it cant handle different logins simultaneously?

[20-Aug-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a single user wallet

[20-Aug-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
specifically via localhost

[20-Aug-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
no remote access

[20-Aug-19 06:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, understood now

[20-Aug-19 07:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
how far is nSPV from supporting light dice CC play?

[20-Aug-19 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
komodod -nSPV=1 might already support it, not sure

[20-Aug-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv has to have each CC rpc implemented, once the basic finalizeCCtx is done. it isnt yet

[20-Aug-19 08:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
üëç

[20-Aug-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
duplicate the functionality of the finalizeCCtx function in komodod

[20-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv is 100% in C, it is a different codebase than komodod

[20-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in komodod already, but using C++ and all the existing komodod

[20-Aug-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv, is just the superlite client without komodod, and it is 100% in C

[20-Aug-19 10:58 PM] Mihailo#5902
@siu - Chainmakers I'm in the middle of refactoring some calls for nSPV, the [cc]list calls won't work right now. I'm on the road this week, but will try to fix it and PR it by end of the week.

[20-Aug-19 11:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers FYI,  you could run a nspv wallet on localhost on some trusted server, then VPN into that network remotely, and then go to https://10.0.0.77 in your browser to view the wallet. You could run any number of these for diff coins on diff ports. This might be something like the original use case you were asking about.

[20-Aug-19 11:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

@Sir Seven could you please try to reproduce crash above? (and collect backtrace / create issue if needed)

[21-Aug-19 03:24 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Hm. @siu - Chainmakers  Can you provide please a bit more info?

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Or you literally just run it and tryed to log in?

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Sir Seven#7158
:)

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
where could it get more info? does libnspv collects a log?

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, ran it and then when to the interface and tried to log in.

[21-Aug-19 03:26 PM] Sir Seven#7158
In browser, got it.

yes, browser

[21-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Can you share your coins file entry for KMDICE?
Is it default?
```
  {
    "coin":"KMDICE",
    "asset":"KMDICE",
    "fname": "KMDice",
    "rpcport":30177,
    "mm2": 1
  },
```

[21-Aug-19 03:40 PM] Sir Seven#7158
With set above it defaults to KMD. And doesn't crash on loging.
```
./nspv KMDICE
couldnt match coin, defaulting to KMD chain
```

[21-Aug-19 03:43 PM] TonyL#3577
`couldnt match coin, defaulting to KMD chain` seems your client not using KMDICE AC on start by some reason
also note that crash might be specific to some Dice CC vouts siu has in his wallet

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] gcharang#6833
{
  "coin": "COIN",
  "asset": "COIN",
  "fname": "Coin",
  "rpcport": 12345,
  "mm2": 1,
  "p2p": 12346,
  "magic": "feb4cb23",
  "nSPV": "5.9.102.210, 5.9.253.195, 5.9.253.196, 5.9.253.197, 5.9.253.198, 5.9.253.199, 5.9.253.200, 5.9.253.201, 5.9.253.202, 5.9.253.203"
}
it needs all these

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
without nSPV field in coins file, it wont do nSPV

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
KMDICE is not running on any of those ip addresses

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
neithere is COIN

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Above is default coins entry for KMDICE. Currently in repo.

[21-Aug-19 03:44 PM] gcharang#6833
i'm just saying all those keys are needed

[21-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to put the ip address of the nodes that run the COIN

[21-Aug-19 03:45 PM] gcharang#6833
`https://docs.komodoplatform.com/nSPV/#property-descriptions`

[21-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@siu - Chainmakers  Can't reproduce.
Please check your coins file for nspv. Check link above. If it repeats on your side, you can share backtrace:
`https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/debug-Komodo.html#run-komodo-daemon-with-gdb-tool`
Pretty much the same for libnspv.

[21-Aug-19 03:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i tried again and it logged in, but even when running ./nspv KMDICE, it seems to log me into the KMD wallet

[21-Aug-19 03:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it shows my kmd balance, not my kmdice balance

[21-Aug-19 03:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it didnt crash this time since i left it running for some time before logging in

[21-Aug-19 03:52 PM] gcharang#6833
@siu - Chainmakers have you modified your coins file to have all the keys described here: `https://docs.komodoplatform.com/nSPV/#property-descriptions`?

[21-Aug-19 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
I believe KMDICE nspv compatible full node is needed to be prepared at first

[21-Aug-19 03:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i did not do any modifications to the libnspv coins file

[21-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would print that it is defaulting to KMD

[21-Aug-19 03:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
indeed @jl777c i just saw it: ```./nspv KMDICE
couldnt match coin, defaulting to KMD chain
