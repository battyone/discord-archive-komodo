gotta set HOST and a buncha other weird shit

[23-Aug-19 07:51 PM] radix42#3743
lemme know if the binary build works @siu - Chainmakers

[23-Aug-19 07:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 would all your binaries work if I decided to actually go with the PRO version of the pine64?

[23-Aug-19 07:51 PM] radix42#3743
should

[23-Aug-19 07:52 PM] radix42#3743
they work on nanopi and any other armbian

[23-Aug-19 07:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it worked!

[23-Aug-19 07:52 PM] radix42#3743
NICE

[23-Aug-19 07:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i do need to fetch zcash params

[23-Aug-19 07:53 PM] radix42#3743
grab fetch-params.sh from source anywhere

[23-Aug-19 07:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
copying them from my laptop

[23-Aug-19 07:53 PM] radix42#3743

good to know you CAN run on an rpi4

[23-Aug-19 07:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers I do understand that it's strategic for us to support a widely known/supported hunk of HW (even if I don't like it) and I hope that you can show the world stuff running on a rpi üòâ

[23-Aug-19 07:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, i guess you dont have merged the nspv code, right?

[23-Aug-19 07:59 PM] radix42#3743
into what?

[23-Aug-19 07:59 PM] radix42#3743
it builds out of the box on arm

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
no

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
the binaries

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
are too old for nspv

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 your binaries are from before nspv

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] radix42#3743
oh

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
the ancient olden days, before superlite

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, those binaries can't sync HUSH

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] radix42#3743
they are from right after 0.4.0a

[23-Aug-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, that is old üòÖ

[23-Aug-19 08:01 PM] radix42#3743
I'll update them soon

[23-Aug-19 08:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
we can all barely keep up with James, that must have been thousands of commits ago

[23-Aug-19 08:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well, it would be a nice way to run a full node at home while you access it using nspv

[23-Aug-19 08:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
errybody who wants a binary send a donation to jane and i bet a new binary just magically appears soon üôÇ

[23-Aug-19 08:03 PM] radix42#3743
is the nspv stuff is master yet or HSM or what?

[23-Aug-19 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmm

[23-Aug-19 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
good question

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not master yet

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 you might just want to build from the FSM branch

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] radix42#3743
that's what I've been tracking

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it's there

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] radix42#3743
had trouble with FSM sometimes on arm before

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH merges FSM in to track KMD

[23-Aug-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
FSM has a mac compile error on it right now

[23-Aug-19 08:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
might effect arm too, but you can add `return("")` to the end of the offending function if that happens

[23-Aug-19 08:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
you done good

[23-Aug-19 08:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
probably the first time KMD has ever run on an rpi

[23-Aug-19 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
see! you just need to ask the right people üòÇ

[23-Aug-19 08:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think so, yes

[23-Aug-19 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
tweet that shit up

[23-Aug-19 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
"These KMD binaries are known to work on xxx on RPI4" is probably some good marketing to go somewhere, and also using superlite

[23-Aug-19 08:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
doubleplusgood

[23-Aug-19 08:08 PM] radix42#3743
pretty sure it is the first time

mrlynch didn't get the right os on his when he tried

Thanks to @radix42 implementation of @KomodoPlatform  on ARM arch, for the first time ever we have been able to run a zcash fork on a #raspberrypi4  using #aarch64 #manjaro https://t.co/otxPaRVZWI

[23-Aug-19 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, so now its just a matter to merge the nspv code and you could run komodo on crappy HW with no disk space

[23-Aug-19 08:15 PM] radix42#3743
we ran libnspv on a 32 bit rpi3 already

[23-Aug-19 08:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, this runs easily, but no full node!

[23-Aug-19 08:17 PM] radix42#3743
i know i know

[23-Aug-19 08:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i hope it fits on my 32gb microSD

[23-Aug-19 08:18 PM] radix42#3743

thanks for all the nice binaries

[23-Aug-19 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far its running quite well

[23-Aug-19 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
using less than 1gb of ram

[23-Aug-19 08:26 PM] radix42#3743
doesn't take too much

[23-Aug-19 08:26 PM] radix42#3743
to sync kmd

[23-Aug-19 08:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

@siu - Chainmakers make a shielded xtn on that fucker

[23-Aug-19 08:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i need to wait for it to sync first

[23-Aug-19 08:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ill leave it here over the weekend, on monday ill do it.

[23-Aug-19 08:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
ya, you do

[23-Aug-19 08:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i hope it doesnt burn itself over the weekend ;p

[23-Aug-19 08:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers if it has a case that can be opened or removed, do that

[23-Aug-19 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just ordered the case this week, still waiting for it to arrive

[23-Aug-19 08:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the case i bought even has a little fan to cool the cpu

[23-Aug-19 08:39 PM] radix42#3743
ah if its open air right now it should be fine to sync for cooling

[23-Aug-19 08:40 PM] dukeleto#7326

it's been a lot of fun working on this GUI for the nSPV pywallet TonyL built. I just added some tabs to reduce clutter on screen, an active theme changer, and an address book which lets you add and delete a name to address in app that gets stored to a CSV file and loads it in when you start the GUI.

Looks great! Will test a little and merge then. Also gonna make it work not only with komodod nspv but with libnspv to bring new live into this light wallet üòÉ

found what was the problem in building libnspv on termux:
in libnspv/src/tools/cryptoconditions/src/include/secp256k1/Makefile.am there is unconditionally set -march=x86 option that breaks the compilation on termux @jl777c

[24-Aug-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
good news! can you make a PR that fixes this?

[24-Aug-19 08:23 PM] dimxy#2587
ok
