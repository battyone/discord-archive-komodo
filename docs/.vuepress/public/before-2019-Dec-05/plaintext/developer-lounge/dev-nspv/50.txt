the onetime script in ~libnspv shows the build process

[22-Aug-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch only

[22-Aug-19 06:44 PM] dimxy#2587
I see

[22-Aug-19 06:52 PM] CMaurice#1685
I edited `-march:x86-64` to `-march=aarch64` in `Makefile.am` but it's a generated file and is recreated with `-march=x86-64`
I don't know much about this sort of thing but enjoying learning

[22-Aug-19 06:53 PM] CMaurice#1685
no, it's something else

[22-Aug-19 07:04 PM] CMaurice#1685
the `aarch64` does propagate to the other Makefiles but the build fails with the same error

[22-Aug-19 09:18 PM] dimxy#2587
received  the same error

[23-Aug-19 04:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
Main HUSH seednode is running latest nspv v3 code, it's currently syncing from scratch but will be ready for testing soon

[23-Aug-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
@dimxy now you duplicated it, hopefully you can track it down and fix it

@dimxy @Mihailo @blackjok3r I updated https://github.com/jl777/libnspv/issues
you will see a few with your handle on it. we can discuss the details on github for things that are unclear. i think 107 will need some discussion. we have a chance to make a nice maintainable way to create signed CC tx

I was able to install manjaro 64bit on raspberry pi

[23-Aug-19 05:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe i can get to build Komodo here?

[23-Aug-19 05:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@dukeleto

[23-Aug-19 06:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers go ahead and try

[23-Aug-19 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
stops in the same place

[23-Aug-19 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
there is no build instructions for arm i believe

[23-Aug-19 07:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers do you remember what I said about this?

[23-Aug-19 07:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers you could offer @radix42 a bounty, or she can tell you if it's viable. what you are doing have never been tried before, and it's not going to be easy for you to compile things

[23-Aug-19 07:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's only ever been tested on ARMbian

[23-Aug-19 07:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers and to put it in perspective, it's $40 to buy a better machine that "just works" or potentially paying somebody to do dozens of hours of work to get an old piece of HW to work. Or maybe it not that hard, I have no idea

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is why rasppi's are just overpriced and not dev-friendly

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
compiling zcash on arm also takes hours

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have a better machine... i am just curious if its possible to build komodo on the new Rpi that has 4gb

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
how invested are you on using this device?

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you said it wont ever work since raspbian is 32bit

[23-Aug-19 07:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a reason armbian doesn't even care about supporting various rasppi's

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
32bit is a nogo

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
64bit is a maybe-go

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but the new rpi4 supports 64bit and manjaro already published a 64bit arm version

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i am trying this in the new manjaro 64bit arm version

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
never heard or used that linux distro

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
and no idea what stuff they do

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its based on arch

[23-Aug-19 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
like I said, it's lots of work to maybe support shitty rasppi hw

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe rpi4 is viable, not sure

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 has more informed opinions about the HW and porting KMD to it

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but its cheap. and has 4gb ram which is something that should be nice to have.

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's actually not cheap

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's more expensive, than the better counterparts

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
?

[23-Aug-19 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you look at performance

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you mean banana pi and stuff like that?

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
please, don't try to sell me on how good rpi4's are üôÇ None of the devs here want to support it

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
really?

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you will need to convince radix42

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why?

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
Nobody cares to support old expensive weak shite

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also, rpi never was viable anyway

[23-Aug-19 07:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe 64bit rpi4 is viable, maybe

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i am talking about the new model that just came out in july

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
but, who gonna do the work? radix42 never wanted to touch these, because the OS is broken

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it has 4gb and supports 64bit software

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
rpi's as a whole, are expensive and resource limited

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326

rpi4 is for kids to play with

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
that machine, that i linked above, runs KMD perfectly

[23-Aug-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you want something else, you get to do a massive amount of work

[23-Aug-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
to maybe have it work

[23-Aug-19 07:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that pinearm is arm, its basically the same work if i understand this correctly

[23-Aug-19 07:43 PM] radix42#3743
it uses the rock64 not the pro but the pro would run kmd fine

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 oops, wrong model

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] radix42#3743
rasbpi 4 needs a 64bit OS, which means a 3rd party one

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 siu wants to use Majaro 64bit linux on an rpi4

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, archarm and manjaro already have 64bit versions for it.

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is the viability of that? it's not armbian

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] radix42#3743
no idea

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers there you go

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
Nobody wants to do free work to support old shitty hardware

[23-Aug-19 07:44 PM] radix42#3743
what's it based on

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
and rpi4 is old and shitty, in my book

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] radix42#3743
did i see arch above?

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
overpriced. most of the cost of an rpi goes to marketing

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] radix42#3743
prolly run my binaries then

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
i doubt it, to be honest

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
some tiny difference in how the filesystem is laid out with break some library

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 is it completely staticly linked?

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] radix42#3743
why? just needs glibc

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] radix42#3743
i think lemme check

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just imagine ARMbian => Manjaro linux is a huge jump, no idea what changes lie beneath

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe some kernel setting

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
gosh, I can't imagine all the ways it could break

[23-Aug-19 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe it just works

[23-Aug-19 07:47 PM] radix42#3743
well ok a buncha libraries

[23-Aug-19 07:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 who knows if they even use the same glibc version?

good ol libgomp

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so you know this is the uname -a for the manjaro version im running: ```Linux rpi 4.19.65-1-MANJARO-ARM #1 SMP PREEMPT Tue Aug 13 14:39:03 UTC 2019 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is good

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
same arch

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
it has some chance of working, i give it that

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@radix42 which repo i could try?

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] radix42#3743
https://crypto.mercerweiss.com/komodo-v0.4.0-aarch64.tgz

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
but libs and other weird shit could break something

[23-Aug-19 07:48 PM] radix42#3743
there's komodo binaries for aaarch64

[23-Aug-19 07:49 PM] radix42#3743
don't try a source build yet try that binary first, source builds are voodoo on aarch64

[23-Aug-19 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't even know how to do those

[23-Aug-19 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure I do!
