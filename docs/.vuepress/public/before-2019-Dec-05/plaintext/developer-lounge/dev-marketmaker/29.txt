best would be if the taker would continue the swap... instead of waiting for makerpayment refund

Looks like the swap failed, but I did not receive the taker coin

@Patrick Crypto Hello, BTC maker payment locktime is almost 48 hours, if the taker is gone and didn't send his payment MM2 will automatically refund after locktime expires, please wait. We will possibly reduce the locktimes for BTC swaps, but not too much since it might take few hours sometimes for BTC transaction to be confirmed.

Ok, thanks

It looks like this is the relevant info from the swap json? "event": {
              "data": {
                "error": "maker_swap:474] timeout (26090.0 > 26090.0)"
              },
              "type": "TakerPaymentValidateFailed"
            },

Yes, taker payment data was not received by your node, MM2 is now waiting for right moment to issue a refund.
