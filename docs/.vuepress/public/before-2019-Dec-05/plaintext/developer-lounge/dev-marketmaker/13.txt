Great!

[23-Jan-19 11:31 PM] Mylo#8306
@artem.pikulin is this statement true:
```
Marketmaker v2 is in alpha testing with nightly builds.  It removes the 7 step atomic swap design from v1 but remains backwards compatible with it.  Also removed is the need for >100% deposit to market make.
```

[24-Jan-19 04:35 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mylo Hi, all true except `remains compatible`, MM2 is not backwards compatible with MM1, and not only swap protocol is incompatible.

[24-Jan-19 04:36 AM] Mylo#8306
OK. Thank you.

[24-Jan-19 04:36 PM] tolken#2655
Based on ca3333‚Äôs twitter posts on BarterDex 2.0, is it safe to say MM2.0 has moved well beyond porting 1.0 code? Seems like a lot of work has already been done to push it to the next level. @artem.pikulin

[24-Jan-19 06:30 PM] Mark81#4505
Where is mm2.0 taking place? Will there be public test?

[25-Jan-19 05:38 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@tolken @Mark81 Yes, a lot of work has been done, many parts were ported/refactored/or even implemented from scratch. Please expect announcement very soon. It was said that MM2 early alpha would be available in January (for trading `test only` coins) and  we will keep the promise.

MM2 team is happy to announce that first stage of MM2 internal testing is finished and alpha is now live! It's still unsafe to trade assets with real market cost. Also we don't have the GUI for it yet so it's too early to announce `public` tests for the globe. We need to be sure that MM2 works correctly in different environments. Every computer/server is actually unique: OS version, installed updates and applications, different internet providers, etc. 
So we invite you to participate in `private` community testing! The only requirement is you are familiar with CLI and ready to provide detailed report if you find an issue. If you have only old Windows 7 laptop it's fine, we need to cover as more `real user` environments as possible. Your contribution will help to make MM2 `much` better and drive it to release faster. If you can't wait to start playing with MM2 please DM me, I will add you to special `MM2 community tester` group and instruct what to do next. Thanks in advance to everyone, we're doing our best for you!

[31-Jan-19 05:35 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@tolken @crypto999 @Mark81 @mobipoi I've already added you to `MM2 community tester`. I'll contact you today to discuss what we'll do üôÇ

Is the "trust" function still in the new market maker? Or is this something separate?

[05-Feb-19 08:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Meyse Hi, `trust` and `zeroconf` swaps are not implemented in MM2 yet, we will work on it later. We're concentrating on basic trading functionality to work properly.

yes

[16-Feb-19 10:03 AM] CrisF#3405

I'm having trouble with an extra space being added. Will try the `wif` and see if that helps.

@artem.pikulin can you add me as well please?

[22-Feb-19 07:48 PM] supermanblockchain#3870
hey @artem.pikulin! I see this answer from you earlier: 

```
artem.pikulin12/26/2018
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.
``` 

I understand about CLTV, but in an attack scenario I don't understand how this mitigates a Bob from "faking it" and accepting a bunch of trades but never filling them. In that scenario, wouldn't there be a bunch of Alice's doing "alicepayments" and locking their funds up when a malicious bob has no intention of actually sending his "bobpayment" (filling the order). This seems like it could cause a lot of trouble on the DEX, especially if a fake bob set a really low exchange rate which beat out other real bob's.

[22-Feb-19 07:48 PM] supermanblockchain#3870
asking again in here as suggested by @KomodoWorld

[22-Feb-19 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if bobs are ranked based on total trades completed and percentage, any such bad bob will quickly not get any trades

[22-Feb-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is similar to eBay. if you are a seller with no history, people wont be so eager to trade with you. if you have a bad history then they definitely wont want to trade. Another point is that the dexfee is not going to the bad bob, so this is for no direct economic gain, which means it is not incentivized to actively do this

[22-Feb-19 08:08 PM] supermanblockchain#3870
I see what you mean. But it seems like it would be possible  to programmatically spin up a bunch of bobs with fresh reputations, add orders to the order book with really good prices for every coin pair, and then trick every alice that is attempting a trade to lock their coins up. Would it make more sense to just lower bobdeposit so that it acts sort of like the alicefee in a "protect the network from spam" kind of way?

[22-Feb-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if the network is attacked by these evil bobs (who dont gain anything), then yes, bob side would need a dexfee to prevent this

[22-Feb-19 10:57 PM] willofleo#7505
Yes sometimes people can act out event that seem to have no economical benefit to themselves, but on a different paradigm it might make sense like a competitor trying to cause disruption as their offensive cost is very low.    similar to why a male praying Manits choses to have sex with it eventual killer maybe it that good ,, at least on an evolutionary paradigm it nutrition for off spring production  .... just a rant ......

[22-Feb-19 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is a problem, we can add more fees, but I think having a historical ranking of pubkeys will be sufficient. it seems to work ok for eBay

[22-Feb-19 11:13 PM] willofleo#7505
@jl777c what if that was the plan , (competitor using Game theory) ,  doing such knowing you will increase the fees  until  it much higher than they offer to gain lower fee advantage ,

[22-Feb-19 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
well, the mm1 way of big bob deposit, people did not like and we did not get many bobs

[22-Feb-19 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so we need to try this more symmetric approach with feedbacks on bob history.

[22-Feb-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if people avoid those with no/bad history, it seems this annoyance attack wont even be so annoying

[22-Feb-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
and alice can also use the KMD on deposit by the bob to rank desirability of bob

[22-Feb-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not make problems out of non-economic "attacks"

[22-Feb-19 11:19 PM] willofleo#7505
aha yes  I digress although I think the rep ranking should be enough , people care a-lot about their reputation apparently one of the highest cause of suicide .

[22-Feb-19 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and yes, someone could create a lot of sybil accounts and trade with themselves to create a good ranking and then start the bad behavior. so with such an investment, then the annoying bob will get a few alices before their ranking starts to degrade

[22-Feb-19 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are doing it just 10% of the time, then it isnt that annoying and not much of an "attack"

[22-Feb-19 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is very easy to overthink things and try to make it perfect. which is not achievable

[22-Feb-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what if someone just DDosed the entire internet to shut everything down?

[22-Feb-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes with amplification attacks that is sort of what happened, but it cant be sustained for a long time and is very expensive. degrading a competitor is not direct revenue

[22-Feb-19 11:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and at first any DEX will be no threat at all

[22-Feb-19 11:23 PM] jl777c#5810
by the time DEX becomes a meaningful volume, then there is a history of good bob behavior that alices can rely on

[23-Feb-19 03:39 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Man.... i was just thinking some type of BASIC central device to control UTXOs in and out would be so eas sier.... if anon is anon then it shouldnt matter if there is a control is  there.....you are already storing your data on local host....until it is stored in KV.  . You are still not anon completely.... there is work to be done yet..... i think the buy sell orders could be moved to a more offline KV approch using CC and timelock approaches....if then goto... thats my 6 month theory ....use it

[23-Feb-19 09:58 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@supermanblockchain Hi, in addition to the above comments: the purpose of swap protocol refactoring is to improve `user experience` (e.g. remove 212% for Bob). Actually `old` protocol had same issues, it didn't prevent order spamming from someone not planning to follow protocol at all. We should separate `atomic swap protocol` from such `security` discussions. From `security` point of view protocol must guarantee that if it's not followed properly both sides won't lose their funds and that's it. Detecting a malicious trader and banning him is responsibilty of other MM2 modules that `interact` with `atomic swap`. Think of it this way: if you implement server on top of `HTTP` protocol, the protocol itself doesn't protect you automagically from `HTTP flood`, it's responsibility of your application to detect and ban someone trying to send malicious requests (DDos or other attacks).

[23-Feb-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
agreed

Maybe the team is working on that

[22-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Mylo#8306
0conf probably come after release.   main apis first, then add the bells & whistles later once core stuff re-implemented in new framework and swapping exceeds original.

[22-Apr-19 12:27 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Regnar Hi, yes, 0conf is not supported in MM2 yet. @Mylo is right, we're working on basic features first. 0conf is advanced feature that should be added for sure, maybe it will be `completely` different from what it was before, we will see once we start adding this.

@klein the MM engine wans't ready for the Barterlly use case, a direct trade required a vps with fixed ip and home users can't creat that on the fly. Maybe with MM 2.0 it will be possible to find a way. So dwy started with a web based service and will implement a direct p2p method in time, as the tech makes it possible

USDC is ERC20 token, it's supported even in MM1 and was tested some time ago. TrueUSD is also ERC20 token so it should supported by default.  GUSD is also ERC20 so should be supported without any modification (and even on MM1). So all mentioned  stable coins seem to be supported already. Are there any (popular) stable coins that `are not` ERC20? üôÇ
