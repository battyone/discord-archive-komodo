so this command shows you KMD balance not VRSC? do you have VRSC activated?

[09-Oct-19 12:34 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yes

[09-Oct-19 12:35 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
shows the KMD balance for BTC too

[09-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I must have soe error in my initialization?

[09-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Oszy#5734
游뗷

[09-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Of course it's not exactly clear on how to properly initialize the coins so that is pretty likely

[09-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Oszy#5734
what do you have in the "coins" file

[09-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Oszy#5734
mm2 activates those on startup

[09-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
It's the coins file from JL777

[09-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Oszy#5734
I just tried the same command and it gives me correct balance for each coin

[09-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Oszy#5734
{"address":"XXXX","balance":"Y","coin":"KMD","locked_by_swaps":"0"}

[09-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Oszy#5734
shows same balance for everything, and coin: "COIN_NAME" is correct in response?

[09-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yeah

[09-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
what is the mm2 output? not the console

[09-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
same?

[09-Oct-19 12:40 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
one moment, I am restarting mm2

[09-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I am not sure what you mean by mm2 activates the coins on startup, because when I just restarted, I get error: no such coin when I try to get the balance

[09-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Oszy#5734
`coins file from JL777` has all available, keep only what you need.

[09-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Oszy#5734
is VRSC in your coins file?

[09-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yes

[09-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
KMD as well

[09-Oct-19 12:43 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
No such coin

[09-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I had to connect to them before

[09-Oct-19 12:44 PM] Oszy#5734
where did you put coins file?

[09-Oct-19 12:45 PM] Oszy#5734
next to mm2 binary?

[09-Oct-19 12:45 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
/atomicdex/target/debug

[09-Oct-19 12:45 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
yes same dir

[09-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Oszy#5734
oh okay, connect to electrum

[09-Oct-19 12:46 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I followed the 'liquidity provider' tutorial

[09-Oct-19 12:47 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
how do I do that?

[09-Oct-19 12:48 PM] Oszy#5734
first i thought u were using native

[09-Oct-19 12:48 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I don't understand what you mean by connect to electrum though

[09-Oct-19 12:49 PM] Oszy#5734
Execute the following command:

`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"RICK\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10017\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10017\"},{\"url\":\"electrum3.cipig.net:10017\"}]}"`

will connect you to the coin's electrum server so you can see balance / trade

[09-Oct-19 12:49 PM] Oszy#5734
you need to know the electrum URL's

[09-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Oszy#5734
let me check that guide you were following.

[09-Oct-19 12:50 PM] Oszy#5734
`Connect to the KMD network
#Command
./KMDconnect.sh`

[09-Oct-19 12:51 PM] Oszy#5734
this does the same thing but it's scripted for you already

[09-Oct-19 12:51 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
That is what I did before

[09-Oct-19 12:51 PM] Oszy#5734
Ok so connect KMD and VRSC now

[09-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Oszy#5734
you can only see the balance of what you have connected

[09-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"VRSC\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:1000$

[09-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Is that I used for VRSc

[09-Oct-19 12:52 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
sorry hard to copy from the terminal

[09-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Oszy#5734
did it connect?

[09-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Oszy#5734
did you get response?

[09-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I edited the kmd connect and replaced kmd with vrsc

[09-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Yes, same balance as KMD

[09-Oct-19 12:53 PM] Oszy#5734
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{"userpass":"$userpass","method":"electrum","coin":"VRSC","ipaddr":"el0.vrsc.0x03.services","port":10000}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{"userpass":"$userpass","method":"electrum","coin":"VRSC","ipaddr":"el1.vrsc.0x03.services","port":10000}"

[09-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Oszy#5734
this is what i see for VRSC

[09-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
"balance":"82.05722569","coin":"VRSC","result":"success"

[09-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Where do you see that?

[09-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Oszy#5734
did you not change URL?

[09-Oct-19 12:54 PM] Oszy#5734
if not you activated KMD electrum for VRSC

[09-Oct-19 12:55 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
The documentation for the API seems to presume everyone reading it will know where to find that info-- doesn't seem to be linked

[09-Oct-19 12:56 PM] Oszy#5734
True that the guide doesn't say what to do apart from KMD/LTC, I hope you okay now

[09-Oct-19 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
<https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums>
might help

[09-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Oszy#5734
Keep separate .sh files for each coin you want to activate, and change url:"" to the correct electrum servers

[09-Oct-19 12:58 PM] Oszy#5734
then you will see correct balances

[09-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Ok, I changed the URL in my script and now it works. Thank you

[09-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
What does the coins file actually do? Anything?

[09-Oct-19 01:01 PM] Oszy#5734
tells mm2 the coins configurations

[09-Oct-19 01:02 PM] Oszy#5734
every coin has different configs, some are same as btc, some are very different, like erc20

[09-Oct-19 01:03 PM] Oszy#5734
it contains all settings for each coins from contract address, to address rules, default txfee, minconfs etc.

[09-Oct-19 03:55 PM] ffffffff#0658
has anyone seen this error before? im trying to build mm2 from source

i686 and x64 is this want to be cross compililation?

[09-Oct-19 04:02 PM] ffffffff#0658
?

[09-Oct-19 04:02 PM] ffffffff#0658
i don't understand

[09-Oct-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
i686 is a specialized 32-bit processor and the program is 64-bit
the error comes from the PC being seen as i686, not x64
is this a vm?

[09-Oct-19 04:05 PM] ffffffff#0658
no. the docs mentioned that running it on 32bit may be possible but errors may be encountered

[09-Oct-19 04:06 PM] ffffffff#0658
so i messaged here  to see if it was a common error easily solvable

[09-Oct-19 04:06 PM] ffffffff#0658
if it's complicated, then not a big deal. i understand it's not really for 32bit systems

[09-Oct-19 04:06 PM] Oszy#5734
Try installing

[09-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Oszy#5734
gcc-multilib

[09-Oct-19 04:08 PM] Oszy#5734
then `$ rustup target install i686-unknown-linux-gnu
$ cargo build --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu`

[09-Oct-19 04:08 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
...and maybe, in the future, lead off with using a 32bit system 游땔

I updated successfully. Thanks for your help yesterday - one issue now, the orderbook output is far less clean now.  Specifically, the "max_volume_rat" fields are broken up all over the screen. Any ideas?

[10-Oct-19 06:57 AM] Oszy#5734
do you use | jq?

[10-Oct-19 12:48 PM] allbits#5898
Yes

[10-Oct-19 12:49 PM] allbits#5898
It was fine before update mm2. Now not. Exact same command used, piped to jq

[10-Oct-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
check your formatting vs the number of characters
perhaps there's more or less characters now, forcing terminal output to format differently?
it's kinda hard to guess without seeing how you're manipulating the json

[10-Oct-19 12:55 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@allbits Hello, could you please provide a sample output that you get from your MM2?

[10-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I am a bit confused about the relation of orders I place with the cli and orders on the mobile app and what I can see on Oracle

[10-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Are all of those things pulling data from the same source?

[10-Oct-19 02:15 PM] Oszy#5734
if you are on the same netid yes
