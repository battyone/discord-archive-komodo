new DHT approach will obsolete these issues, no sense to be fixing what will be fixed with new method

[11-Dec-18 01:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[11-Dec-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if netflix is the issue, dont swap and flix at the same time

[11-Dec-18 01:30 PM] jorian#4555
DHT as in bittorrent style DHT? that's nice

[11-Dec-18 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
wish me luck getting my kids off netflix

[11-Dec-18 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its either netflix plus work or no netflix and no work 😂

[11-Dec-18 01:31 PM] namhoang28#4328
hey guys,
I could not reproduce this bugs on this morning but It happeed last night when I try to make 3, 4 swaps at the same time lastnight. Maybe it’s network issue

[11-Dec-18 01:32 PM] namhoang28#4328
@artem.pikulin I will PM you the logs from my side

[11-Dec-18 01:37 PM] cipi#4502
just saw some decoding errors from a BEER/COQUI swap...

[11-Dec-18 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[11-Dec-18 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but it seems to be going through today

[11-Dec-18 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lets see if it gets stuck

i just noticed, it might also have to do with such slow mining of blocks.

[11-Dec-18 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think the issue might actually be in the COQUI chain.

[11-Dec-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but either way, seems like the slow block creation makes the swap get stuck

[11-Dec-18 01:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i got stock in `waiting for bobdeposit`

[11-Dec-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@siu - Chainmakers  You will need to force thorugh blocks... MM by default needs 3 blocks, but AC OnDemand only mines a single... and as all of us that were force mining empty bocks on AC pretty much stopped... The chains that are onDemand will now get stuck.

[11-Dec-18 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, understood. I just had not realized this 😂

[11-Dec-18 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah it wasnt an issue for some time.. but after awhile and with so many chains, the extra space on Notary node wasnt worth it for the tiny amounf of use on the chains.

[11-Dec-18 02:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also the bear

[11-Dec-18 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that too I guess... at least for me, that wasn't a factor in my desision to stop cpu mining every single AC via stratum... it wsa costing me $0 ... but my SSD's and everyone elese were just getting fileld for no reason 😂

Can a bdex communicate with a daemon that’s installed on another machine, assuming proper ports are designated, or does it have to be on same machine as bdex?

[11-Dec-18 05:19 PM] tolken#2655
I was going to configure ZEC,  but realize now they only have a Linux daemon. Would prefer to run it on a Linux box, then have bdex communicate with it via RPC, should that work?

@artem.pikulin there is no need to update the coins file for sapling activations. I made a code change the other day that does this

[15-Dec-18 10:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jl777c Thanks! I can see that PR was created and merged in my fork. The release with these changes was published 10 hours ago: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases/tag/v1.0.1045.

[16-Dec-18 02:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why was that this happened? ```autochange BTC validateaddress -> getaddressinfo
BTC importaddress 1BSGtQC6iuWt58iebnJoPwPoM8EGmwetBn from  failed, isvalid.0
cant importprivkey.BTC 1BSGtQC6iuWt58iebnJoPwPoM8EGmwetBn -> ({"error":"couldnt import"}), abort session

[16-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
there is some rare case that causes some memory issues on startup. just start again should fix it

[16-Dec-18 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
well it will still happen rarely, but you avoid it by starting again

[16-Dec-18 02:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have restarted various times, still get the same issue

[16-Dec-18 02:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also tried using the artem release marketmaker and the same happens.

[16-Dec-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow it says it is invalid.0 address, but it is a valid address. no idea why

[16-Dec-18 03:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```bitcoin-cli validateaddress 1BSGtQC6iuWt58iebnJoPwPoM8EGmwetBn
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "1BSGtQC6iuWt58iebnJoPwPoM8EGmwetBn",

}
```

[16-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont use the more recent BTC core as they broke almost all the vital rpc calls

[16-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
intentioanally

[16-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you can put it in backward compatible mode, but i dont know the syntax

[16-Dec-18 03:07 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ahh... that might be the issue, im using the PPA version, so it might be the latest.

[16-Dec-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
likely they made it so some key functionality of rpc call that was working for almost 10 years is totally changed

[16-Dec-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
like signtransaction no longer working the way it used to

[16-Dec-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
or getinfo being deprecated

[16-Dec-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
or validateaddress having new functionality, but some other "new" rpc call behaving as validateaddress has been working

[16-Dec-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
on and on I can go

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC core is intentioanally breaking the rpc

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
torvalds said it best about not breaking userspace

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what advantage this brings?

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for them

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows them to pretend that only they know how to write code?

[16-Dec-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
since the entire installed base is broken

[16-Dec-18 03:10 PM] jorian#4555
validateaddress is indeed one of the changes in btc 0.17

[16-Dec-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
such practices gave us the removal of double spend prevention. since basically the entire point of blockchain is to prevent doublespend, this campaign of "optimizing" bitcoin is breaking everything

[16-Dec-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the advantage is that nobody would understand the idiocy of such practices, so they wont get any heat over it and it allows them to be "in control"

[16-Dec-18 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
@siu - Chainmakers building from source is piece of cake now, might be better to get that into your system

I use the latest Linux marketmaker from here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/BarterDEX/tree/dev/assets/bin/linux64

[21-Dec-18 04:43 PM] bartwr#6773
So I don't have to update the marketmaker binary, but the transaction itself?

[21-Dec-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
using the updated repo (mine or artems) will update the type of tx it makes

I'm testing KMD/CC swaps.

In the last 5 hours I did 30 swaps, of which 3 swaps succeeded. 

One of the common errors is the following, of which cipi and I do not have an explanation for:

```Could not find tx out: 868ebfc6a614fd95faac5a799b0cda9c15b67f9a8fa6e58e69d70aa9472d422a 0

It's strange that this error exists, because the tx's it referencing have more than 300 confirmations already.

Does anyone know an explanation for this error? /cc @jl777c

[28-Dec-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
which repo?

[28-Dec-18 03:58 PM] bartwr#6773
I use a dicoapp fork based on this one by particle4dev https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e, with some modifications added. This exact repo I'm using: https://github.com/CoinCollect/dicoapp-e

It seems the errors do not have anything to do with the client. It's updated to the latest marketmaker build by @artem.pikulin https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases and the coin config is defined so it uses the Sapling fork https://github.com/CoinCollect/dicoapp-e/commit/3399917329aa65b581ade6b5a0ac3cafb0274b28

strange, the swap continues... it took more then 10 confirmations on bobdeposit before bob saw it

[28-Dec-18 04:33 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
MM2 is not really usable currently, it lacks ETH/ERC20 and Electrum support. New swap functions don't currently save the state of swap to filesystem so in case of abortion swap will be stuck. It's planned to finish ETH and Electrum support on next week. So I think we will have something testable in January. The guide  https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/tree/mm2-dice#cmake-build-of-marketmaker-with-linked-etomic-lib-for-etherc20-atomic-swaps is outdated.
Actually we have "old style ETH/ERC20/Electrum" nightly builds here: http://195.201.0.6/etomic/, however these might contain same issues as actual release build from my fork.

@bartwr You're welcome, just to be more clear: http://195.201.0.6/etomic/ - you can try the latest build from here, it was done `before` swap protocol refactor and ETH/Electrum support removal. Also some UTXO validation on order matching is removed in these so maybe `alice not eligible` won't happen. But anyway: `use at your own risk`.
