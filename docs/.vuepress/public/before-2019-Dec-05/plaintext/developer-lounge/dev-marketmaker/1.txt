hi, do you know where I can find the code/doc for connecting a peer into the p2p network and retrieve orderbook data?

[15-Jun-18 11:55 AM] ASKz#1905
(or just point me in the marketmaker code )

[15-Jun-18 11:55 AM] ASKz#1905
didnt found it myself

[15-Jun-18 12:09 PM] jorian#4555
you want the actual source code? or documentation on how to do it?

[15-Jun-18 12:14 PM] ASKz#1905
the twos are fine for me, I want to do it in another language

[15-Jun-18 12:16 PM] ASKz#1905
if I see how it is connecting/retrieving in the actual code it would be fine I think

[22-Jun-18 08:59 PM] 7rank#9952
Anyone successfully setup a marketmaker on a raspberry pi 3?

[22-Jun-18 09:00 PM] 7rank#9952
What are the best trading pairs that will likely see some interest from the community?

[22-Jun-18 09:05 PM] 7rank#9952
Is it better to use Vps?  If so, what are the minimum specs?

[23-Jun-18 12:21 AM] cipi#4502
mm itself doesn't use that much resources, but the coin daemons do (KMD wallet uses 3GB RAM, BTC 1GB, LTC 700MB), so it depends on the coins you want to run

[23-Jun-18 03:41 AM] 7rank#9952
@cipi yikes!  So if you want to setup 2 or 3 trading pairs you easily will need 8gb? I'm thinking pi 3 for testing but then use Vps for multiple trading pairs.

[23-Jun-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
What we really need to do its get bobs able to use insight API or electrum, so you can have a heap of marketmakers in very cheao VPS or PI 3... all pointing back to one server with all the coind's on it.

[23-Jun-18 04:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw... is it expected behaviour for marketmaker to just crash out on bobs after a certain amount of days... every time I get around to checking my BEER/PIZZA bobs the marketmaker seems to be dead but the coind's are still running.

[23-Jun-18 04:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have taken the 5 bobs down for now too. As I think 80% of the time they were not active and just wasting my money. Its no issue to start them back up at any time, just let me know. All the wallets/passphrase ect are stored locally on my laptop takes 30mins to deploy 5 VPS and setprices.

[23-Jun-18 04:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, could someone point me towards info on how MM connects to native daemons (not sure on the terminology here)?
I haven't been able to see my balance in native BarterDEX although the native coin wallets show the balances. 
I've been stuck on this for 2 weeks and I'd like to get it sorted out.

[23-Jun-18 04:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Wondering if this is connected to my Agama whitescreening for the last 2 months or so...

[23-Jun-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it reads the conf file

[23-Jun-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if that is not where marketmaker expects it to be, it wont be able to read the rpcuser/rpcpassword

[23-Jun-18 06:57 AM] AkiraX#8269
hi

[23-Jun-18 06:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
i have this error in barterdex

[23-Jun-18 06:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
swap never started

[23-Jun-18 06:58 AM] AkiraX#8269
is that preventing me from doing other trades

[23-Jun-18 07:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... unless you have lots of UTXO it will reserve a pair, and then the swap wont start, and the pair will stay reserved until you restart marketmaker... not sure why this isnt getting fixed.

[23-Jun-18 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it gets unreserved after 5min

[25-Jun-18 07:30 AM] tolken#2655
Is there any way to force a limit on size of utxo you‚Äôre offering for trade?

[25-Jun-18 07:32 AM] tolken#2655
(Aside from splitting into smaller ones)

[25-Jun-18 07:33 AM] tolken#2655
I want the larger ones for use, perhaps for other pairs.

[25-Jun-18 07:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
this will be needed for ETH otherwise the bob get drained by the high tx fees ideally (in the future) there would be a minordersize and maxordersize parameter

[25-Jun-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
use full:1

[25-Jun-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
then it will only trade the specified amount

[25-Jun-18 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
oh you want to set a maxsize...

[25-Jun-18 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
for now bob is limited in this respect, would need to have multiple bobs, each doing different sizes

[25-Jun-18 07:35 AM] tolken#2655
Yep, a large utxo may be larger than I can process. So, for now may have to temporarily shut down order filling. Should be fine for now. But yea as CHMEX mentioned a min/max would be helpful here, per pair or even per pair and unique to rel and base.

[25-Jun-18 07:37 AM] tolken#2655
Won‚Äôt be a problem once I have more funding; but just s minor issue for now.

[25-Jun-18 07:38 AM] tolken#2655
multiple bobs could help, but introduces its own complications. Just need a less tight supply.

[25-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c I probably won‚Äôt be the last to make such a request, so I humbly request it for sometime down the line if it seems worthwhile to you. Min/max trade, unique to base/rel of a given pair. Would offer some powerful flexibility when hosting a variety of pairs.

[25-Jun-18 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this will be for mm2.0

2 months

[26-Jun-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they lacked the OP codes??? So once they add them we just add to Bdex faster than they add to whatever system they are using?

[26-Jun-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
as alice side only 2of2 msig is needed

[26-Jun-18 12:10 PM] ASKz#1905
just tested their wallet... really buggy

[26-Jun-18 12:11 PM] ASKz#1905
slow, crashing, btc-type coins not showing addresses

i reached out to ricardo again

[26-Jun-18 12:17 PM] PTYX#6840
we can beat them to the punch

[26-Jun-18 11:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Bitcoin Core: 0.16.1 produces multiple debug outputs (and assuming other minor issues) relating to the depreciation of getaddressinfo
is there a way around this other than using the -depreciatedrpc switch for bitcoind?

[26-Jun-18 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
use 0.15

[27-Jun-18 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"couldn't find my txid to make request"
I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is coming after alice payment and before bob payment and swap seems to stop there

[27-Jun-18 12:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
suggestions?

[27-Jun-18 01:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, in the excitement of it being added, I never thought to ask:
How does one cancel gtc? setprice...price:0?

[27-Jun-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
exit

[27-Jun-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
or use the cancel api

[27-Jun-18 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have multiple trades going of similar sizes, it can end up spending one of the gtc utxo and then it wont be able to find it

[28-Jun-18 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"or use the cancel api"
That was, literally, my question: What is the syntax of the "cancel api" for a sell with gtc:1?

[28-Jun-18 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't find anything other than using setprice with a price of 0

[28-Jun-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
which doesn't seem to work for gtc:1

[28-Jun-18 04:03 PM] jorian#4555
what does gtc stand for btw?

[28-Jun-18 04:03 PM] jorian#4555
good till cancelled?

[28-Jun-18 04:04 PM] jorian#4555
so yes, the cancel functionality would be helpful then üòÖ

[28-Jun-18 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes @jorian 
`gtc:0 fill:1 is fill or kill
gtc:1 fill:1 is a good till canceled and filled
gtc:1 fill:0 is good till cancelled or partially filled`

[28-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
from the help api output

[28-Jun-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
cancel(uuid)

[28-Jun-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
else if ( strcmp(method,"cancel") == 0 )
        {
            return(LP_cancel_order(jstr(argjson,"uuid")));
        }

[29-Jun-18 02:44 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm trying to sort out what has changed, but my btc doesn‚Äôt seem to want to broadcast price now. I didn‚Äôt change any autoprice config. But I don‚Äôt remember seeing that message above until recently. Also seeing a similar error with LTC.  I can see their balances via BarterDex and even did a withdrawal of btc using withdraw in BarterDex

[29-Jun-18 02:47 PM] tolken#2655
So it seems btc is still more or less configured properly. It does show installed but inactive.

[29-Jun-18 02:56 PM] tolken#2655
Mmm, think something else is going on, checking my scripts

[29-Jun-18 02:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@tolken roll back your BCore to v15

[29-Jun-18 02:59 PM] tolken#2655
Oh yea? Definitely a problem? I had some successful bob trades the other day. I think one of my problems above is an autoprice misconfiguration

[29-Jun-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's literally telling you:
`getinfo

This call was removed in version 0.16.0.`

[29-Jun-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Core removing API calls is not a misconfig in mm

[29-Jun-18 03:04 PM] tolken#2655
got it working, yeah i screwed up my autoprice. :/ so much for not modifying my autoprice. thanks for the info Computergenie.

[29-Jun-18 03:13 PM] tolken#2655
that message has likely always been there, just didn‚Äôt pay attention till I ran into my broken autoprice config

[29-Jun-18 03:25 PM] tolken#2655
Cool, don‚Äôt have much funded, but have ltc/btc, kmd/bch, kmd/btc pairs on orderbooks now üòÉ

[29-Jun-18 03:29 PM] tolken#2655
next eth and some erc-20s

[29-Jun-18 04:05 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi, was is easy to rollback LTC, @tolken ?  I'll have to try this tomorrow. Any info about this would be appreciated!

[29-Jun-18 04:06 PM] CrisF#3405
Did you need to do the same for BCH (rollback)?

[29-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tolken#2655
Rollback?

[29-Jun-18 04:06 PM] tolken#2655
Sorry I haven‚Äôt done that yet

[29-Jun-18 04:07 PM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I misunderstood.

[29-Jun-18 04:07 PM] tolken#2655
Not entirely clear if it‚Äôs really necessary.

[29-Jun-18 04:08 PM] tolken#2655
They both seem to be working fine at moment, but I haven‚Äôt thoroughly tested every trade pair.

[29-Jun-18 04:08 PM] CrisF#3405
So you fixed the error by only changing the script?

[29-Jun-18 04:08 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve seen trades kmd/btc, kmd/bch, but nothing with ltc just yet. Though I technically just got ltc configured properly this morning, as far as I can tell (showing on orderbooks)

[29-Jun-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
Yes those messages don‚Äôt seem to prohibit them from running. I had subsequent autoprice calls clobbering my kmd/btc pricing, which gave me the idea they were all broken.

[29-Jun-18 04:10 PM] tolken#2655
But just an error on my side.

[29-Jun-18 04:11 PM] CrisF#3405
Good it worked out then.

[29-Jun-18 04:13 PM] CrisF#3405
I am almost finished reinstalling everything after wiping ubuntu.

[29-Jun-18 04:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Hopefully a fresh system will mean I can get this finally working.

[29-Jun-18 04:15 PM] tolken#2655
Great, I hope so. I am going to try a clean Linux setup again soon.

[29-Jun-18 04:16 PM] tolken#2655
Too messy on my prototype setup

[29-Jun-18 04:19 PM] CrisF#3405
I'm just getting back to clean prototype, haha.

[30-Jun-18 04:13 AM] tolken#2655
Does anyone have any ideas why/what would cause bdex to show a lower (significantly at times) balance than as shown in Agama/explorer? It seems like the UTXOs in question are maybe locked from recent trades. I didn‚Äôt appear to have any swaps dependent on those UTXOs. To resolve the discrepancy, I decided to restart BarterDex and the hidden UTXOs /balance game back to the proper amount. Is there another way to detect/flush this out? I hadn‚Äôt had bob trades for hours, so getting them to come back seemed directly related to me restarting bdex which was otherwise functioning properly.

[30-Jun-18 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
does the cli balance call show the right balance

[30-Jun-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
does the listunspent add up to the right balance?
