which branch you are using

[23-Jul-18 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
?

[23-Jul-18 03:14 PM] tolken#2655
ahh maybe thats whats going on - I don't think I ever used the client_osx one in the past

[23-Jul-18 03:14 PM] tolken#2655
didn't work for some reason in the past

[23-Jul-18 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't use `./client_osx` it will never work on macOS

[23-Jul-18 03:14 PM] tolken#2655
and yet it appeared to O_O

[23-Jul-18 03:18 PM] tolken#2655
@SHossain I have been using client for months, have done many trades with it

bob and alice

[23-Jul-18 03:21 PM] tolken#2655
As a matter of fact I would have swore someone said don't use it.

[23-Jul-18 03:21 PM] tolken#2655
guide above doesn't specify either way for what its worth

[23-Jul-18 03:29 PM] SHossain#0007
on macOS?

[23-Jul-18 03:29 PM] SHossain#0007
the API summary doc has description for all scripts

[23-Jul-18 03:31 PM] tolken#2655
yep, on macOS - I just looked at my old backup of the scripts I was using. Definitely was running with client rather than client_osx. Unsure what changed.

[23-Jul-18 03:34 PM] SHossain#0007
afaik, there are difference between `client` & `client_osx`
```
$ cat client
#!/bin/bash
source passphrase
source coins
./stop
git pull;
cp ../exchanges/updateprices .;./updateprices
cd ..; 
./m_mm;
pkill -15 marketmaker; 
stdbuf -oL $1 ./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":1, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &
```
```
$ cat client_osx
#!/bin/bash
source passphrase
source coins
pkill -15 marketmaker; 
git pull;
cd ..; 
./m_mm;
./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":1, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}/Library/Application\ Support\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &
```

[23-Jul-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
when i run `client` in my mac it outputs error with `stdbuf` not found

[23-Jul-18 03:38 PM] tolken#2655
yes thats what I get now, but apparently I had what was necessary (for whatever reason) for that to work at one point.

[23-Jul-18 04:48 PM] tolken#2655
@Mylo @Alright  I‚Äôm not sure who keeps these docs updated, but for whoever may be concerned may I request that they make two changes? 1. ‚Äúsudo apt-get...‚Äù that whole bit should be under the Linux heading. 2. Since we‚Äôre describing two install types, Linux and MacOS, it should distinguish between client and client_osx.

Thanks Mylo!! üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 02:34 PM] tolken#2655
I have a new setup in macOS, running with client_osx this time. Interestingly I seem to have LTC, BTC and BCH running and showing balances etc within bdex, but not KMD. I did notice that the expectation of where these config files reside changed. I changed the path of my config files accordingly, which helped bch/ltc/btc, but not kmd. The path (the path bdex says its expecting) seems odd/redundant. For example: ```/Users/tolken/Library/Application Support/Library/Application Support/Komodo/komodo.conf``` This path isn't the path Agama is using though. Will this cause issues like the one I'm experiencing? To be clear - Bdex finds the path to the Komodo.conf when I place it there, but it won't show any balance (which I know it has)

[26-Jul-18 03:56 PM] tolken#2655
The two Komodo.conf files are identical (copied from Agama‚Äôs Komodo for to the dir BarterDex expects. @SHossain

[26-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Lezlaig#5952
Hi @cipi. I was told you were the person to speak to about an update for a client that Komodo supports. Enforcement being switched on tomorrow and I haven't yet managed to get confirmation from support that Komodo will be on the right chain. Any help appreciated! üôÇ

[26-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Lezlaig#5952
I have realised that this was in the wrong channel, sorry! üòä

[26-Jul-18 10:09 PM] cipi#4502
No problem. Which coin are we talking about?

[26-Jul-18 10:14 PM] Lezlaig#5952
Hey, thanks! Crown (CRW). Client has updated to version 0.12.5 with enforcement switching on tomorrow. https://medium.com/crownplatform/crown-core-v0-12-5-release-notes-211b83659188

maybe .conf file is not found?

[27-Jul-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
coin.conf

[27-Jul-18 01:24 PM] tolken#2655
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. I‚Äôd like to understand why marketmaker is looking for config paths in such an odd place as mentioned above. That‚Äôs probably part of the issue. I am putting the config file right wherein bdex is asking for it to be. Is there a way to force bdex to look at where the Agama install puts it?

[27-Jul-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the GUI should pass in the coins JSON with any custom dirs

[27-Jul-18 02:10 PM] tolken#2655
The coins.json (maybe I‚Äôm mistaken) seems to have all coins kmd. I‚Äôll look again though. I assumed kmd was handled/defines somewhere else for some reason. I‚Äôll search again, maybe I‚Äôm not using right string.

[28-Jul-18 09:18 AM] tolken#2655
@SHossain. @Nabob  I have reinstalled MacOS three times in a row now and I get the same results where then paths seem out of the ordinary. The guide explains that you have to install brew and to google how. Easy enough, I run the basic brew install and then running client_Osx complains about not having cmake. So I install using ‚Äúbrew install cmake‚Äù and then client_osx starts.

[28-Jul-18 09:20 AM] tolken#2655
```/Users/tolken/Library/Application Support/Library/Application Support/Komodo/komodo.conf```

[28-Jul-18 09:20 AM] tolken#2655
@Nabob said this path doesn‚Äôt look right, but that‚Äôs what bdex says every time I start it.

follow this ^^ guide

[28-Jul-18 09:21 AM] tolken#2655
Got it, I‚Äôll try this one. Thank you @SHossain  !

[28-Jul-18 09:51 AM] tolken#2655
So weird. Followed that guide same result. I guess ill erase the os yet again. This is 3rd or 4th os reinstall.

[28-Jul-18 09:53 AM] tolken#2655
Id appreciate of someone using macos could confirm that path above is valid or not, doesn‚Äôt seem right to me.  I‚Äôm literally doing nothing but installing using the guide, installing bdex and Agama.

[28-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Nabob#5004
@tolken  Above link shossain shared works fine. You need to make sure of client script

```#!/bin/bash
source passphrase
source coins
./stop
#git pull;
cd ..; 
#./m_mm;
pkill -15 marketmaker; 
./marketmaker "{\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":1, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\", \"coins\":$coins}" &```

[28-Jul-18 10:05 AM] tolken#2655
@Nabob you‚Äôre testing macos?

[28-Jul-18 10:07 AM] tolken#2655
Ahh, you removed library/application support?

[28-Jul-18 10:12 AM] tolken#2655
alright path looks good now.

[28-Jul-18 10:25 AM] tolken#2655
still no go. More tomorrow. Thanks again for your help!

[28-Jul-18 03:04 PM] tolken#2655
Ok, got something working @Nabob and @SHossain Instead of launching Agama to get kmd runnig, I found where agamas komodod resides and passed it (komodod) the exact path to the Komodo.conf  and that worked. I don‚Äôt know what has changed but I used to be able to just install Agama and have bdex find that komodod automatically.

[28-Jul-18 04:02 PM] tolken#2655
Is there any reason the client_osx has that redundant path? Shouldn‚Äôt that be removed?

[28-Jul-18 10:00 PM] tolken#2655
Yay, just initiated my first Alice ltc/kmd trade since getting this stuff all back up and running.

[28-Jul-18 10:02 PM] tolken#2655
That not working anymore on my previous setup is what provoked me to start from scratch. Glad I have that etomic marketmaker now too, been hoping to get some erc-20 going.

[29-Jul-18 12:58 AM] tolken#2655
btc, bch, ltc, kmd bobs all appear to be back online.

I'm not sure this is the right channel. If not, please point me where I should be üòÑ However.. I was wondering if there is or will be an electrum server for Tether (USDT) within Barterdex? I get the message "No Electrum Servers found for USDT. Please use Native mode for USDT".

[01-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Biomech#5602
Had the same error with a couple others, restarting BDEX fixed that. But this one is persistent, so I'm inclined to think it's real.

[01-Aug-18 04:00 PM] cipi#4502
USDT is just a ERC20-token, not a coin, so you don't need electrum, just select "native"

[01-Aug-18 04:03 PM] Biomech#5602
Ok. I thought it was not ERC20, but I knew it was a token of some sort üòÑ Thanks.

[02-Aug-18 11:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
USDT and True USD are different things though?

[02-Aug-18 11:20 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

My bdex has been humming along fairly well this   Past week. Getting a couple kmd/bch trades per day. Kinda surprised there aren‚Äôt more.

[04-Aug-18 02:47 AM] Biomech#5602
As difficult and twitchy as Bdex is in it's current state, I'm not.

[04-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Biomech#5602
@blackjok3r, it's still not picking it up. showing zero balance. Is there anything I need to put in the .conf for the coin other than the usual rpcuser/pass?

[04-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Biomech#5602
Or is there a conf file for Bdex?

[04-Aug-18 03:06 AM] tolken#2655
@Biomech does the conf path of ROIcoin match where bdex is looking?

[04-Aug-18 03:07 AM] Biomech#5602
I don't know how to tell.

[04-Aug-18 03:09 AM] tolken#2655
@Biomech search the log when you start bdex for roicoin, there‚Äôs a portion of the init where you‚Äôll see a lot of ‚Äúcould not find <someCoin>.conf‚Äù see if roicoin is in that log and if so make sure your daemon is pointing to that same location.
