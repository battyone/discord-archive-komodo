thanks to decimal base its a no-brainer

[18-Sep-19 04:57 PM] Slyris#2880
10 18 is more than uint128t sometimes I believe

[18-Sep-19 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the number of digits, it is trivial to autoconvert it to rational representation. there is no need to force all callers of the api to adopt a new numerical system. that will be error prone and just another barrier to adoption

[18-Sep-19 04:58 PM] Slyris#2880
But yeah rational do the job too

[18-Sep-19 04:58 PM] ca333#0118
bigInt covers that range

[18-Sep-19 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`And if someone create a protocol with more digits`
if (coinname=CoinY) {decimalplaces=18 }
else {decimalplaces= 8}

[18-Sep-19 04:59 PM] cipi#4502
i use 8 decimals for all coins, doesn't matter if they have 18 decimals or 1000

suboptimal if you want to offer precision - which in financial software should be target #1

[18-Sep-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
when marketmaking there is no 100% precision as it all depends on a moving market price anyway

[18-Sep-19 05:02 PM] Slyris#2880
I worked at the BNP Paribas ans they just use strings everywhere with fast algorithm on strings

[18-Sep-19 05:02 PM] Slyris#2880
That's why I speaked about strings

Noob here. I updated with git pull. Then started mm2 again. All works fine. I see all my old orders there.  Only issue so far is that when I do method version I get result UNKNOWN. Have I done something wrong or missed a step?

[18-Sep-19 05:25 PM] ca333#0118
try `git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1 > MM_VERSION` before building

[18-Sep-19 05:25 PM] cipi#4502
the version is set at compile time, but only in the CI builds on github, if you compile it yourself, it is not set... my mm2 looks the same

highest success rate i have seen and the 4 failed swaps were all VRSC swaps. maybe a single user just had some problems

[18-Sep-19 05:36 PM] cipi#4502
that is also what i see in the console output, very few swaps fail... and it looks like the ones that fail do this because one side shuts down his mm2 in the middle of a swap

[18-Sep-19 05:52 PM] allbits#5898
Ok. So after I git pull I have to rebuild?

[18-Sep-19 05:54 PM] ca333#0118
yes - after executing the above `git log` command (https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/449950331577565194/623932507519188993) just rebuild

[18-Sep-19 05:55 PM] ca333#0118
it basically writes the last commit hash into the `MM_VERSION` file which is used for the version

is there a api call in mm2 to get that data? Or is it calculated by somehow looking at the dex fee address? or even parsing the mm2 console output

@artem.pikulin wanted to ask if we can remove the hardcoded txversion/overwintered settings for KMD ACs from here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/558da7d3e7793048a12715f49f71d0b06a520f5c/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L1667
it would allow us to add OOT, which is a KMD AC, but without sapling
PART can be removed from there too
in fact everything from line 1667 to line 1674 could be removed
i will then make a PR to the coins repo to include txversion 4 and overwintered 1 to all KMD ACs that have it

i'm reading up about the use of rational numbers, but i'm having a difficult time to grasp how a rational number in the orderbook is used. can one of the implementors of the rational numbers in mm2.0 explain why this 11 is represented like this? and why this is a good thing?

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/449950331577565194/625744863991955499/unknown.png

[23-Sep-19 05:27 PM] jorian#4555
also, the wording of the pull request of the documentation of rational numbers make it sound like decimal is really going away: <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/pull/126/files#diff-6ab44e5ca9208fafccf3568523c09b2e>

[23-Sep-19 05:29 PM] jorian#4555
furthermore, i think it would help people not experts in rational numbers with some more examples and not just the example edge cases of 2^32

[24-Sep-19 01:12 PM] artem.pikulin#0794 (pinned)
@jorian Hi, please notice that `price` field is not just `11`, it's a number with many zeros after decimal point. So in rational representation it actually becomes `11000000.... / 1000......` which are huge numbers and do not fit standard integer types. So as mentioned in docs these numbers are represented as array of smaller fixed size integers (uint32) and ordered in little endian. It's actually a common way of big numbers implementation.
As it's impossible to copy-paste from screenshot let me provide a smaller number example:
1. Decimal number representation is `11.00000000000000000000000000000000000000`
2. Rational in fraction form: `1100000000000000000000000000000000000000/100000000000000000000000000000000000000`
3. JSON form `[[1,[0,1760524480,3821695294,999050043,3]],[1,[0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]]]`
So in JSON implementation we have 2 numbers `[0,1760524480,3821695294,999050043,3]` which is 160 bit integer `1100000000000000000000000000000000000000` and `[0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]` which is 128 bit integer `100000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

Such arrays can be parsed as (pseudo code):
```
nums = [0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448];
sum = 0;
for i in 0..array.len() {
    sum += nums[i] * 2.pow(32 * i);
}
```
So let's take a look at [0,160047680,1518781562,1262177448]. According to snippet it's 0 * 2^0 + 160047680 * 2^32 + 1518781562 * 2^64 + 1262177448 * 2^96, which is exactly `100000000000000000000000000000000000000`.


But the problem is this huge number can be effectively reduced to just `[[1,[11]],[1,[1]]]`, which wasn't done by MM2, so it's now fixed: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/commit/87fc4beb3e78f5f75cf235d930ebaa5dc3427327.

And the other problem is: where does `11.0000...` come from? I guess it's intended to be just `11`. Did you create the order by yourself or it's received from other node?

[24-Sep-19 01:31 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
`and why this is a good thing?` this particular example wasn't good thing of course, but it should be fixed now by reducing the fraction. The good thing is:
1. Let's say you have 1 MORTY.
2. You want to buy RICK at 11 MORTY per 1 RICK rate.
3. So your desired amount of RICK is 1/11.
4. 1/11 can't be represented as finite decimal, it's `0.09090909....`.
So if we don't use rational here, how should we handle this case to sell exactly 1 MORTY? Of course we can cut it to just `0.09090909`, but then it leaves 1 annoying satoshi as `0.09090909 * 11 = 0.99999999`. Ok, let's try to slightly increase the price to let's say `11.000002`. But then it becomes that `0.09090909 * 11 = 1.00000017181818` which is larger than required 1 by 17 satoshis (that we might not have by the way).

[24-Sep-19 01:32 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
And also as MM2 is multi-coin tool such calculations might become even more tricky since ETH is using uint256 type internally and 18 decimals.

[24-Sep-19 01:33 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
So it's actually the easiest way to let it be `1/11` and then this value is just truncated to required decimals precision of specific coin: for 8 decimals it will be `0.09090909`, for 18 decimals `0.090909090909090909` and so on.

[24-Sep-19 01:52 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
I also removed the `deprecated` for prices and volumes as decimal strings: https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/commit/54cda863b998610227ca2db00021fe2df1c9a4b1. However using rational numbers will be the recommended way to deal with such `1/11` cases.

[27-Sep-19 12:38 AM] allbits#5898
Can I set more than one active bob order on mm2?

[27-Sep-19 05:43 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@allbits Hi, sure, if you'd like to call `setprice` for same pair several times and have different prices you have to specify `cancel_previous:false` in your request as MM2 cancels all previous orders by default: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#setprice. It was done to keep the previous use case of MM1 working: when the price was repeatedly set for same pair by `setprice` it either created new order or changed the price of existing one.

[27-Sep-19 05:45 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please note that this `cancel_previous` is only actual for `setprice`. `buy` and `sell` do nothing with already existing orders and always create a new one.

N00b question, I am rather confused about making orders on here. Say I want to place orders to buy VRSC with KMD at .12, .11 and .1 

I edited ./place_order.sh to include cancel_previous: false

But how do I want to write that order out in the cli?

./place_order.sh VRSC KMD .12 50 | jq '.'

Or

./place_order.sh KMD VRSC 8.333 50 | jq '.'

does `place_order` use the `buy` method, `sell` method or the `setprice` method?

the $1, $2, $3, $4 are the order of the script params

[29-Sep-19 09:21 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so `./place_order.sh KMD VRSC 8.333 50 | jq '.'`
means
`I want to sell KMD for VRSC at 8.333 VRSC per KMD, and I want to sell 50 KMD.`

[29-Sep-19 09:38 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Ok, and is there an effective difference between that and the reverse? VRSC KMD .12 50?

[29-Sep-19 09:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`I want to sell VRSC for KMD at 0.125 KMD per VRSC, and I want to sell 50 VRSC.`

[29-Sep-19 09:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
in terms of price, the inverse math is right, but the overall trade value is less and what is sold / received is opposite.

[29-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
So if I have KMD and want VRSC use the first, and if I have VRSC and want KMD use the 2nd?

is it possible this is a hardware spec issue? currently on an old laptop
this is the output of cargo build --features native -vv

looks like an OSX related build error

are you trying on an old macbook?

When I use curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783/" --data "{"userpass":"$userpass","method":"my_balance","coin":"VRSC"}"

It only displays my KMD balance for some reason.
