that wouldn't make sense

[29-Nov-19 09:22 AM] phm87#7395
yes it is what I read on telegram when I searched

[29-Nov-19 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
you can however swap from the same network, but it's been a long time since i last did that

[29-Nov-19 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
ok, well, i wouldn't know, never tried it

[29-Nov-19 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
> I used setprice to swap 1 RICK to 1 MORTY and I did a second call with the same client/wallet to swap 1 MORTY to 1 RICK
did you use setprice for both?

[29-Nov-19 09:24 AM] phm87#7395
yes but I did both using the same client/wallet/seed

[29-Nov-19 09:25 AM] phm87#7395
if I create a new order with atomicdex on my phone then I create the corresponding order with ``setprice`` with atomicdex-api, I have this situation where the matching doesn't happen:

[29-Nov-19 09:26 AM] phm87#7395
I'll try with ``buy`` instead of ``setprice``

[29-Nov-19 09:37 AM] phm87#7395
Someone is spamming RICK and MORTY orderbook ... why all these weird orders ?

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
yes

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
you can't use setprice to buy

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
setprice == passive, buy == active

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
like i said, setprice doesn't broadcast

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] phm87#7395
I didn't know

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
it only puts an order in the orderbook

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
well, now you know üôÇ

[29-Nov-19 09:38 AM] phm87#7395
but when I created orders with setprice, they were visible in the orderbook

[29-Nov-19 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
yes; it only does that: put orders in the orderbook

[29-Nov-19 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
it doesn't actively look for other orders to take

[29-Nov-19 09:39 AM] jorian#4555
it only makes, it doesn't take

[29-Nov-19 09:39 AM] phm87#7395
maybe it is also linked with the fee : if 2 orders with setprice match, no fee is paid

[29-Nov-19 09:39 AM] phm87#7395
I understand better, thank you

[29-Nov-19 09:41 AM] jorian#4555
> if 2 orders with setprice match
this will indeed never happen, but it doesn't have to do with the fee. you have to see it as the difference between `maker` and `taker` orders. `setprice` makes orders and puts them in the orderbook as a result, for `buy` and `sell` commands to take.
`setprice` == `maker`, `buy`/`sell` == `taker`

[29-Nov-19 09:41 AM] jorian#4555
and if a `buy` or `sell` (`taker` order) doesn't find anything useful in the orderbook, it converts to a `maker` order

[29-Nov-19 09:45 AM] phm87#7395
thank you for the explanation

[29-Nov-19 10:43 AM] jorian#4555
i could be wrong, but i thought mm2.0 had support for order combining: buy 2 orders at once. am i correct?

[29-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Oszy#5734
`self-trading isn't possible, if i recall correctly` using the same R address it's not

[29-Nov-19 10:47 AM] phm87#7395
Oszy: yes I used the same R address and I used setprice so it won't work. Now, I'm trying with 2 different R address and I use a buy instead of setprice

[29-Nov-19 10:47 AM] Oszy#5734
same R will always timeout or neg. failed

[29-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Oszy#5734
i am thinking your "successful" one possibly wasn't your maker order but another that got matched

[29-Nov-19 10:52 AM] phm87#7395
yes

[29-Nov-19 10:52 AM] phm87#7395
I created some orders with atomicdex on my phones but I have no clues if it creates maker or taker orders

[29-Nov-19 11:16 AM] Oszy#5734
if you set a price, you are maker, if you select an existing price you are taker

[29-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Why the 2 orders of 20 aren't matched? even so the 19.999 on the left.

[29-Nov-19 01:41 PM] Oszy#5734
it's been like this for a couple hours now

[29-Nov-19 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
what do you mean?

[29-Nov-19 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
you mean the arbitrage opportunity that now exists?

[29-Nov-19 02:54 PM] jorian#4555
albeit very small

[29-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Oszy#5734
no

[29-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Oszy#5734
look

[29-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Oszy#5734
there is sell for 19.99 and buy for 20

[29-Nov-19 04:02 PM] Oszy#5734
that should match no?

[29-Nov-19 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you might need to drop it the difference of fees
19.99 + fees > 20, maybe

[29-Nov-19 04:06 PM] Oszy#5734
oh it's not mine i was just observing the book today

[29-Nov-19 05:45 PM] jorian#4555
the orderbook won't actively settle these cases, i think. if you create a bid for 20 using `setprice` and an ask for 21 using `setprice`, there will be no trading

[29-Nov-19 05:58 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Oszy @phm87 Hi! The @jorian comments are correct, the 2 or more orders created by `setprice`call are maker only and no attempt to match between them is made. So `there is sell for 19.99 and buy for 20`is currently possible.
`I created some orders with atomicdex on my phones but I have no clues if it creates maker or taker orders` - AFAIK AtomicDEX GUI typically uses buy or sell methods, which create the taker order first, but if it's not matched it is then recreated as maker's and stays in orderbook until matched or cancelled. It is also mentioned in tips of buy/sell methods docs: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#buy

Thank you for the explanation

[30-Nov-19 08:28 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I am a bit confused about fees. As I understood it, makers do not pay fees. But someone bought .0078 bitcoin worth of a coin from me, but I only received .0077209. Is there a network fee I am missing?

[30-Nov-19 09:47 PM] cipi#4502
yes, the one from BTC
```bitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 1
{
  "feerate": 0.00027014,
  "blocks": 2
}
```

[30-Nov-19 09:50 PM] cipi#4502
or whatever coin was makercoin (maker selling)

[30-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Ok, thanks. I figured that must be it

[01-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I am getting an abnormally high number of failed swaps trying to sell KMD for DEX. Using 2.0.1417

[01-Dec-19 05:40 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
6 taker fees spent

[01-Dec-19 05:53 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
they aren't even showing as failed it seems either

[01-Dec-19 06:03 PM] Oszy#5734
@cipi 10021 and 10017 are which electrums? I am getting tons of timeouts on 21 and connection refused on 17

[01-Dec-19 07:51 PM] cipi#4502
10017 is RICK and 10021 is VRSC... the electrums are restarted every week (on Sunday) and VRSC once a month (because it needs 24h to get back online)... and that is why we have 3 electrums‚Ä¶ so just ignore the messages

I can retrieve orderbook without correct userpass, is it normal ?

[02-Dec-19 08:53 PM] phm87#7395
Another question : what does TakerFeeValidateFailed means ? How can this error be raised ? I had an internet connection drop, maybe it can explain why I had this error

[02-Dec-19 08:56 PM] phm87#7395
```error: maker_swap:403] Taker fee tx_details_by_hash failed utxo:1585] JsonRpcError { request: JsonRpcRequest { jsonrpc: "2.0", id: "6153", method: "blockchain.transaction.get", params: [String("1fd47a4a0811cfb38e7987497360aca4687db46846fbbf2f7df071bb58cc26ad"), Bool(true)] }, error: Transport("rpc_clients:770] rpc_clients:770] [\"rpc_clients:1412] common:1070] future timed out\"]") }```

[02-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Oszy#5734
I asked the same question before didn't get a reply. I assume it's normal since nothing secret about the orderbook itself..

[02-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Oszy#5734
TakerFeeValidateFailed mean that the first amount the taker sent as a fee, wasn't sent/confirmed within the time lock could be due to slow chain or disconnect

[02-Dec-19 09:31 PM] phm87#7395
my second attempt to swap was successfull ... but the coins didn't arrive yet ... do you know what are Komodo addresses beginning with b such as bJMMgzhjocM2bcFKFdN4UCw7M2NjBaeqPi ?

[02-Dec-19 09:32 PM] SHossain#0007
those are time-locked `p2sh` addresses

[02-Dec-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
thank you

[02-Dec-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
I'm wrong about my second attempt: it failed with MakerPaymentSpendFailed

[02-Dec-19 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
I should get back my coins later

[02-Dec-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
is it a good idea to make a third attempt ? I'm both seller and buyer here, I control both sides, I create only buy and sell orders (no set_price). I used the same price and the same volume but I don't know if it is good to do

[02-Dec-19 09:47 PM] phm87#7395
sigh ... it failed again with MakerPaymentSpendFailed

[02-Dec-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
``error: Response(Object({"code": Number(1), "message": String("the transaction was rejected by network rules.\n\n16: tx-overwinter``

Is there a mechanism in place to prevent self trading?

[02-Dec-19 10:39 PM] phm87#7395
I had to set up 2 mm2 "nodes" to be able to trade with myself but using 2 different passphrases/addresses

[02-Dec-19 10:40 PM] phm87#7395
I searched this discord and on telegram, someone else mentionned that he can't trade with himself so yes I think that it is possible to trade with ourselves, we need 2 different parties I think

[02-Dec-19 10:59 PM] phm87#7395
about the error I encountered ``the transaction was rejected by network rules`` it seems that I encountered the same error of smk <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/454> ... I'm using a ticker that is not yet into <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins> I added it locally on each of my mm2 node but is it sufficient ?

[02-Dec-19 11:01 PM] cipi#4502
assetchains with sapling active need
```    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,```
in the coins file, else you get the above error

[02-Dec-19 11:02 PM] phm87#7395
I think it is fine, I sent you the coin config in DM (please keep ticker secret for now ^^)

[02-Dec-19 11:06 PM] phm87#7395
I think that it uses the local file because I was able to enable the coin, to create buy and sell orders that stays in the orderbook

[02-Dec-19 11:07 PM] phm87#7395
nearly whole swap was fine but something fails at the end, I'll dig more

[02-Dec-19 11:19 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
If you are keeping the ticker secret because you are worried someone else might initiate a swap, you can change the ports on your nodes to something other than the default

[02-Dec-19 11:56 PM] phm87#7395
Many people know the ticker, it is a well-known smartchain but I like surprises. Thank you for the idea how to hide a little bit

@phm87 cipi gave you the answer

[03-Dec-19 08:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@phm87 Hello!
`I can retrieve orderbook without correct userpass, is it normal ?` - yes, the orderbook method is considered public, the information is available on any node so there's no need to put it under password protection.

[03-Dec-19 08:54 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Patrick Crypto Hi!
`Is there a mechanism in place to prevent self trading?` - yes, your node will ignore the ordermatch messages that are sent using pubkey equal to your node's pubkey. Overall MM2 is not designed to support several nodes using same passphrase/keypair, as of now it's not strictly prohibited, more kind of undefined behavior.

[03-Dec-19 09:01 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@phm87 `Another question : what does TakerFeeValidateFailed means ? How can this error be raised ? I had an internet connection drop, maybe it can explain why I had this error` - yes, it was caused by internet connection drop. You should also see some electrum related errors in your MM2 log in this case. 
TakerFeeValidateFailed can also be raised in following cases:
1. Coin's RPC server returns the error (e.g. transaction is not present in coin's blockchain at all).
2. Transaction is there, but it's sent to wrong address or amount is wrong.
Here's fee validation code for UTXO coins, you may see all conditions there: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L1109

I have a swap in progress which has the status of makerpaymentsent. The maker coin has been deducted from my wallet, and has about 20 confirmations, but the swap has still been pending for a couple hours now

[03-Dec-19 09:46 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Any suggestions?

[03-Dec-19 09:53 PM] cipi#4502
your node is waiting for takerpayment now

[03-Dec-19 09:59 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Should I continue to wait?

[03-Dec-19 10:01 PM] cipi#4502
you have no choice... if it takes too long, the swap will fail and you get your makerpayment back

[03-Dec-19 10:03 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Any idea how too long is? What would happen if I shut down mm2?

[03-Dec-19 10:05 PM] cipi#4502
not sure, depends on the coin... BTC takes longer, because blocktime is 10min...

[03-Dec-19 10:06 PM] cipi#4502
it makes no difference if you shutdown or not... what do you want to achieve with shutting down?

[03-Dec-19 10:06 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
My maker is btc, taker is kmd.

[03-Dec-19 10:07 PM] cipi#4502
