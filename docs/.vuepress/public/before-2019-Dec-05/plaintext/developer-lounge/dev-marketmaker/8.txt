speaking of GTC, if i put a gtc order in barterdex do i have to leave the application open or can i close it?

[07-Sep-18 10:22 PM] cipi#4502
application must always be open, else no swap is possible... the txs must be signed when the swap happens and that is only possible as long as the application is running

[07-Sep-18 10:23 PM] cipi#4502
i would do the following: get a VPS, install marketmaker, set your desired autoprices and let it run forever üòÉ

[07-Sep-18 10:26 PM] c2k#4915
ok ty

[07-Sep-18 11:10 PM] c2k#4915
can anyone see if there have been any KMD/EQL trades on bdex or hdex lately and at what price?

[08-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can see eql/btc on exrates.me

[08-Sep-18 04:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its very cheap...

[09-Sep-18 09:42 PM] jspook16#3059
can hyperdex and barterdex no longer run simultaneously on the same machine?

[10-Sep-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No they cant

[11-Sep-18 02:01 AM] jspook16#3059
i used to be able to do this in previous versions... is that because they were using different versions of marketmaker?

[11-Sep-18 03:19 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
you can run 2 guis on same MM - but they most likely it would break - it has worked in the past for Devs- only briefly for testeing - you will need 1 MM for each GUI and probably 1 seed for each. from same IP address.

[11-Sep-18 03:20 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
im only half right

[11-Sep-18 03:22 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
MM is MM you can access is through command line or GUI - im guessing the dexes are branching /forking or not updated to same MM

Hi
I tried to make a swap on barterDEX today but it always timeout. Here is the result of `recentswaps` api:‚Ä®```
{
    "result": "success",
    "swaps": [...],
    "netamounts": [...],
    "pending": {
        "expiration": 1536823121,
        "timeleft": 29,
        "tradeid": 991587069,
        "requestid": 0,
        "quoteid": 0,
        "bob": "COQUI",
        "base": "COQUI",
        "basevalue": 11.11135783,
        "alice": "BEER",
        "rel": "BEER",
        "relvalue": 23.88010012,
        "desthash": "c88a033b587244cd501e90709620c3ec58d9c3886e33c2e1db909d0451aa5833",
        "aliceid": "11469275510081323009"
    }
}
```
and after 60 seconds, there is empty in pending field and no swap is processing. Does anyone have an idea of what it happened and how to fix?

Don't know if I'm in the right place... just extracted BarterDEX 1.1.1-rc and used the passphrase from my 0.8.8 install, and it's on;y giving me three coins, KMD,ETOMIC,BTC as coin options to add, I had native chains for LTC and two other coins in my 0.8.8 BarterDEX IIRC

oh, linux-64

[16-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Mylo#8306
a cpl minor versions back the management of coins meant you had to enable a coin first, restart barterdex and then activate it.

I think it‚Äôs still in design phase still.

[29-Sep-18 10:03 PM] tolken#2655
Don‚Äôt know how much coding has begun. Think they said early 2019, but do t know if that means first alpha or full release.

[01-Oct-18 07:02 AM] ph03nix#3115
mm 1.0 worked very well in the beginning of the year

[01-Oct-18 07:02 AM] ph03nix#3115
i wonder what happened ü§î

[01-Oct-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
I would suggest to use seed nodes that are actively managed. it is a small code change or a parameter on startup

[01-Oct-18 08:17 AM] ph03nix#3115
can you be more specific?

[01-Oct-18 08:19 AM] ph03nix#3115
as i understand, there are networking issues with current mm

[01-Oct-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
try using netid that is not 0 using a known reliable server

[01-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
in a networking system when the system behavior changes

[01-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
people immediately say "the software is broken"

[01-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
however if the software didnt change and the system is not working as before, isnt it a million times more likely that some networking issue is the reason

[01-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
like maybe the SPV server isnt quite working, or the seed node is stuck, etc?

[01-Oct-18 08:31 AM] ph03nix#3115
food for thought üçú

[01-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
Like if you are browsing and a site doesnt load, is your first reaction "the browser just got a new bug"?

[01-Oct-18 08:36 AM] ph03nix#3115
no

[01-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but with mm, that seems to be the reaction

[01-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
there are many servers involved and their state is changing a lot more than an mm that is not

[01-Oct-18 08:44 AM] ph03nix#3115
the goal of mm 2.0 is to solve these networking issues?

[01-Oct-18 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
did you read what I wrote?

[01-Oct-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you just asked if it is possible to make a browser that can always load a webpage

[01-Oct-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of if the website is working or not

[01-Oct-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
mm2 will improve things as much as it possible clientside, but if the SPV server is down, what do you suggest be done to make the swap work?

[01-Oct-18 08:54 AM] ph03nix#3115
i don't have a suggestion or a solution

[01-Oct-18 08:55 AM] ph03nix#3115
thinking out loud

[01-Oct-18 09:02 AM] ph03nix#3115
if SPV server is down i suggest to use native

[01-Oct-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[01-Oct-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the first step to solving a problem is to actually know what the true problem is

[01-Oct-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
mm codebase has been stable for months, so it is unlikely for the code to just spontaneously get a new bug

[08-Oct-18 02:14 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c  ```like maybe the SPV server isnt quite working, or the seed node is stuck, etc?``` Sorry for my ignorance on this, but what exactly constitutes a seed node? Is mm a seed node? Are you implying the problem with mm isn‚Äôt mm, but people‚Äôs improper local configurations of mm? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs better or worse than it was, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work well for most people. If I remember correctly I think you‚Äôve implied that bad bobs are basically the root of the low success rate of order matching.

[08-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
netid 0 i believe is the only netid in use

[08-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
netid 0 defaults to one of my neglected nodes as the seed node

[08-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe setting it to a reliable maintained node is a good idea

[08-Oct-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be a month or more and i dont even login to my seed node

[08-Oct-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and all of barterDEX/hyperDEX might be defaulting to relying on it.

[08-Oct-18 02:35 PM] tolken#2655
It seems like it‚Äôs generally a good idea to be on a common netid to make sure people find other people. Is maintaining a node just a matter of running the relay node/mode in marketmaker?  Could we/should we get this node delegated to be run by someone else if you think it may be in need of more attention?

[08-Oct-18 02:36 PM] tolken#2655
That said, someone just successfully bought and sold (two trades!)  an erc20 from my bob today! Kmd/salt and salt/kmd!! Thanks to whoever did it!! @lukechilds @artem.pikulin

[08-Oct-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, best for someone like cipi to run the default seed node

[08-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be overridden at anytime, but as you say it is best for now to aggregate traffic before we split it across 14000+ netids

[08-Oct-18 03:09 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe it can be a joint responsibility. There‚Äôs not a huge security concern if multiple users were running/admining it? @cipi perhaps we could run it, if you could train me what to look out for/how to fix it if it misbehaves? üòÉ

[08-Oct-18 03:19 PM] cipi#4502
a seed node? without wallets? only needs to be run on a server without too much ressources and started with ./run instead of ./client

https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/setup-FR-full-relay-node-barterDEX.html

[08-Oct-18 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
no wallets needed

[08-Oct-18 03:22 PM] cipi#4502
don't have a free server atm, but i look if i find one, some leftovers from the past üòÉ

[08-Oct-18 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r @grewalsatinder do  you think you can make a script like you did for tx blaster using mm for setting up FR node with 0-64 or more netid with each instance running mm? if there is a once script process, it would be nice and easy.

[08-Oct-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
starting X marketmaker FR nodes is no problem, but i am quite busy atm.

[08-Oct-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so you want to have FR nodes for X netids?

[08-Oct-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or 64 netid's ?

[08-Oct-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
james mentioned you cannot really have more than 16 FR node per netid aswell once... If there is more per netid, and the clients choose one randomly would things work better?

[08-Oct-18 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
I want 0 to n instances of marketmaker running on each netid from one server.

[08-Oct-18 03:31 PM] SHossain#0007
of course using a different port for each mm

[08-Oct-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont need a large number of them, just one very reliable one

[08-Oct-18 03:33 PM] SHossain#0007
if the script allows us, we can set the number of instances we will be running. it could be just 4 netids

[08-Oct-18 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the startup specifies the netid/seedip

the 2 new FRs are showing up on getpeers from the bobs

[08-Oct-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
now the code needs to change the default ipaddr

[08-Oct-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i will do this now

[08-Oct-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
if ( (seednode & 1) != 0 )
                strcpy(fixedseed,"46.4.78.11");
            else strcpy(fixedseed,"46.4.87.18");

[08-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I messed up git for a bit, but I think all is well now. the first 10 netids will alternate between those two nodes

[08-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just as the default, any other ipaddr can be used on startup

hello!  is there anyway in marketmaker to have/generate more than one smart address without having to change the passphrase? the impression I got from this document here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/JUMBLR-Whitepaper is that one passphrase == one smart address for each coin.

@luke That's JUMBLR whitepaper, not marketmaker.
same passphrase in BarterDEX or Agama will always create same address. it can't generate 2.

[12-Oct-18 04:51 PM] luke#8628
thanks @SHossain ,  so in order to get a different smart address I need a different passphrase. Is it possible to change passphrases on the fly without having to restart marketmaker (through RPC perhaps?) or does it always require a restart?

[12-Oct-18 04:53 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to restart marketmaker in order to use different passphrase

[12-Oct-18 04:54 PM] SHossain#0007
or use different passphrase in another computer

just to tell people around they can just use their mnemonic passphrases on other wallets...instead of having to export each privkey one by one
