@siu - Chainmakers @ca333 @hyperDEX @Slyris Hi! Please pay attention that `orderbook maxvolume` field format was changed to decimal string since: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/commit/5df6b043439060300bd8b1927aeadfe4b4214566.

I'm looking for something written about the underlying marketmaker functionality.
Something i remember reading ... "every order is considered a buy".
Where is this written?

[17-Oct-19 06:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#setprice
`The setprice order is always considered a sell, for internal implementation convenience.`

https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#sell
```Buy and sell methods always create the taker order first. Therefore, you must pay an additional 1/777 fee of the trade amount during the swap when taking liquidity from market. If your order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a maker request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the setprice method.
```

i see no available swaps for rick/morty, can someone verify? 

`//127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\"}" | jq` 

produces

I recall someone asking about that earlier.... guess he "figured it out". There is an option to not cancel older orders.

this looks like a mistake, not intentionally leaving them in the book

yeah, seems bot in an inf loop

would be better to make the orders timelimited... and if someone wants the order to stay, he must call `setprice` again

not ban, but a sleep/timeout for placing identical orders within a given timeframe,  from the same maker could be implemented

[21-Oct-19 12:36 PM] Oszy#5734
mm2 could reject it and advise to cancel previous one

orderbook can take some time to propagate if you've just recently loaded mm2. The book on oracle.earth updates every 20 min or so (I've added "last update" text to indicate when)

Curious about what could be done about dust left over from swaps. When someone starts a swap from the mobile app, it seems like you can not purchase the entire amount, so you buy almost the entire order. But now I have orders left on the book with a very small amount left. Aside from finding them and canceling them, maybe there would be another solution?

[25-Oct-19 08:06 AM] Oszy#5734
As far as I know the only way right now is to cancel those, either manually or script it.

[25-Oct-19 08:14 AM] Oszy#5734
I think i found a "solution" to this

[25-Oct-19 08:15 AM] Oszy#5734
of you withdraw all the leftover amount the order disappears

[25-Oct-19 08:27 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
a script which found my orders which were smaller than a certain amount and canceled would probably work. What do you mean by withdraw the leftover amount?

Possible to  use `cancel_by` with `max_base_vol` as a condition after pulling `my_orders`?

[25-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Oszy#5734
in the example only Type:All is shown, what are the other conditions? anything from the json category?

[25-Oct-19 09:21 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I don't want to cancel all though, I want to cancel orders which have say .1253465234 VRSC remaining

A script which finds orders < 1 and then cancels them would work for me. Not sure if it's the most elegant. Not sure I could figure it out either

That's good. Still, I end up with very small amounts of orders left on the books.

[25-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
could be that someone is using an outdated  mm2

[25-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Oszy#5734
like chainswap or hyperdex

[25-Oct-19 09:51 AM] cipi#4502
true, i have some of those too... not sure why, i guess people got used to not be able to buy the entire amount and are using smaller amounts when they buy
but i let the small amount where they are and i wait for someone to sell me more of those coins, which would "resolve" the problem üòâ

[25-Oct-19 09:52 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I recently did some trades with atomicdex and had to buy slightly less than the full amount, or the swap failed. I would guess people do it out of habit now

[25-Oct-19 09:54 AM] cipi#4502
btw, AtomicDEX combines the utxos to the desired amount, so small utxos should clean up themselves over time

[25-Oct-19 09:54 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
ok, i will not worry about it for now. I just don't want to spam the order book and have a bunch of micro amounts left on it

[25-Oct-19 09:55 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I went in and cleaned up 3 earlier

[25-Oct-19 09:55 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
But it's a pain to do on my vps

[25-Oct-19 09:56 AM] cipi#4502
yes, doing it manually is a pain
btw, afaik there is still the limit of 0.0077 (or so), so orders with amounts smaller then 0.0077 will be removed from orderbook

[25-Oct-19 09:58 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
On oracle there is this order: VRSC/KMD    0.1251374100 KMD    0.12035654 VRSC. It's not mine, but I had 3 similar sized orders left over after someone bought from me. Anyway, I am more just glad my trades are working!

[25-Oct-19 09:59 AM] Oszy#5734
prices like this: `"price": "0.02651396963989006157481019209242411347596144151346341529621956383705963512904084546887335065095911760",`
are normal?

[25-Oct-19 10:00 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Probably wouldn't hurt to put in a limit on decimal places

[25-Oct-19 10:00 AM] cipi#4502
yes, this prices where "introduced" with the rational number thing... maybe a limit would be good

[25-Oct-19 10:03 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
8 decimals is 1 satoshi right?

[25-Oct-19 10:04 AM] cipi#4502
yes

[25-Oct-19 10:05 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I think 8 decimals with a minimum difference of some sort between the next lowest order would be good when it starts getting popular, but that would be more difficult to implement I would guess

the problem could also be that erc20 tokens can have up to 18 decimals... 18 is the default on erc20, some people are using fewer though...

[25-Oct-19 10:10 AM] cipi#4502
USDC for example has 6 decimals: https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48
this configuration is part of the contract code

[25-Oct-19 10:16 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
limiting prices to 8 decimals is the same affect as requiring about twice the minimum tokens to trade isn't it?

[25-Oct-19 10:17 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Is there any benefit to allowing trades at .000000000000000001 price?

[25-Oct-19 10:19 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I thought the decimals in the contract just refers to the total supply of the token, but I don't know crap about ETH

gas would be 10000000000x more üòÇ

[25-Oct-19 10:20 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I've never traded on an exchange that had 16 decimals for the price field

[25-Oct-19 10:21 AM] Oszy#5734
neither did I in fact, on most exchanges minimum trade is 0.0005 btc or equivalent in the coin pair, so getting rid of extra 10 decimals wouldn't make anyone mad

[25-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Are there any links to other GUIs for mm2 besides AtomicDex?

bit buggy and in development also not updated to latest mm2 yet, so don't be surprised if you get interesting orderbooks üòÑ

Thanks

has anyone tried electrums with SSL in mm2.0?

[27-Oct-19 04:17 PM] jorian#4555
getting ```error Custom { kind: InvalidData, error: WebPKIError(BadDER)``` with ```{\"url\":\"electrum-abc.criptolayer.net:50012\",\"protocol\":\"SSL\",\"disable_cert_verification\":true}``` taken from <https://1209k.com/bitcoin-eye/ele.php?chain=bch>

[27-Oct-19 04:18 PM] jorian#4555
not setting cert verification parameter doesn't have an effect

i made a swap with these some time ago: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/NMC

RICK and MORTY have SSL electrums too, if you want to test
port is 20017 and 20018

[27-Oct-19 05:24 PM] cipi#4502
i guess the certificate of the BCH server you tried is wrong

[27-Oct-19 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
might be. isn't DER the transaction signing mechanism thing?

[27-Oct-19 05:56 PM] jorian#4555
i now use a tcp that works, though

@jorian Hi!
MM2 relies on rustls and webpki libraries that goal is to enforce good practices of SSL/TLS so it currently support TLS1.2-1.3 only. It's possible to use self-signed certificates, but the certificate itself should have version 3: https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/47#issuecomment-297509272. Here is the guide how such certificate can be created: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18233835/creating-an-x509-v3-user-certificate-by-signing-csr. The certificate generated by openssl with default (legacy) params won't work.
The server you mentioned uses self-signed certificate generated with default params presumably. However there's at least 1 server (`bch.cyberbits.eu:50002`) that uses valid Let's Encrypt certificate so it doesn't require the `disable_cert_verification` at all.

Creating an x509 v3 user certificate by signing CSR
I know how to sign a CSR using openssl, but the result certificate is an x509 v1, and not v3.

I'm using the following commands:

x509 -req -days 365 -in myCSR.csr -CA myCA.crt -CAkey myCA.key -

`{\"url\":\"electrumx-bch.cryptonermal.net:50002\",\"protocol\":\"SSL\",\"disable_cert_verification\":true}` also works, so I guess it's worth to pick the addresses that work and just skip the others since it might be quite hard to change the MM2 behavior in this case.
