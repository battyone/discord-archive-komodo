> What is the content of the json?

@Slyris , `mm2 help` documents some of the JSON fields as well.

[16-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jansako#3330
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Hi, trying the latest Pytomix DEX build, I added the api_keys.json with my keys. Starting MM2 shows a JSONDecode error:  Expecting Property name enclosed in double quotes: Line 6 column 1 (char 214). 
the position of the error changes if I remove the 'coinspot' lines (I don;t use it) so I expect the error refers to the api_keys.json contents.
Character referred to in the error is the last character in the file "}". I made sure there is nothing in front or after it, so no idea what is happening...

[16-Aug-19 10:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
probably a trailing comma on the last key/value pair

[16-Aug-19 10:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
like make sure no comma after "value2"
```{
"key1":"value1",
"key2:"value2"
}```

[16-Aug-19 10:54 AM] jansako#3330
Indeed it was!

[16-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jansako#3330
in my defense, YOU put it there üôÇ

[16-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jansako#3330
into the example file

[16-Aug-19 10:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
correct, I've just removed it, and the coinspot bits because thier API doesnt seem to work at the moment.

[16-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jansako#3330
no idea what that even is üôÇ

[16-Aug-19 10:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
aussie exchange. I also just added some basic copy/paste Graviex api examples, but didnt go much further.

[16-Aug-19 10:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
having some issues with the withdraw api on Binance, but its working otherwise. Not sure, I might have to generate a new API key.

[16-Aug-19 10:59 AM] jansako#3330
are the commands related to the exchange API documented? just looking at what it can do

I meant can PytomixDEX use it already

[16-Aug-19 11:00 AM] jansako#3330
and how

[16-Aug-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I've only added a subset of the API to pytomicDEX. There's a pip package that is probably more comprehensive.

[16-Aug-19 11:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
will add docs over weekend maybe, hadnt mentioned adding the api on discord yet so you got in early lol.

[16-Aug-19 11:02 AM] jansako#3330
going away for a week so I wanted my bob to have the latest MM2 & whatever you put out

[16-Aug-19 11:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the binance_api.py file is pretty self explanatory. Most important thing to note is that buy/sell orders need to conform to the stepsize for the coin being traded as from  https://api.binance.com/api/v1/exchangeInfo

[16-Aug-19 11:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
my bot uses some json to define this, like 
```trading_list = {
    "LTC":{
        "reserve_balance":1,
        "premium":1.xxxx,
        "minQty":"0.01000000",
        "maxQty":"100000.00000000",
        "stepSize":"0.01000000"
    }]```

[16-Aug-19 11:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the      `mm2_balances_table.py`  and  `     mm2_orderbook_table.py` are handy and worth a look. They'll highlight your swaps, coins being traded and coins trading at under market (still tweaking the last one).

[16-Aug-19 11:07 AM] jansako#3330
thanks!

[16-Aug-19 11:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
no worries, enjoy the holiday!

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator Hi, could you please provide the `full` log of your build with `-vv` option?

[27-Aug-19 02:27 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
np, just gimme a minute to get windows back  open

[29-Aug-19 07:58 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
There should be a setting to trade through KMD to any coin from any coin.
. Make KMD default LP - most grandmas wont use the order books. - call it "Grandma Mode" or say trade available with a X% DEX fee.... then do the 3 way swap ...

[29-Aug-19 07:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Alice swaps DGB for KMD then KMD to Etherium Bob swaps Etherium for KMD then KMD to DGB...
Something like that......private swaps will not be popular with shit coins

[29-Aug-19 08:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Or instead of swapping the first step it could just be a purchace transaction from the LP

[29-Aug-19 08:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Like etomic except use KMD

[29-Aug-19 09:15 PM] jansako#3330
The main issue I can see is that the end price, and the ability to execute the whole order chain cannot be accurately predicted. It takes some time before the KMD acquired in the first step can be traded again in the next, and there is a risk of the initial order no longer being available. It would take the ability to 'lock' multiple trades at the same time where the output of one would automagically become the input for another... Now imagine the last LP goes offline so the trade is essentially cancelled. How do you refund all the players/ reverse all the trades? Or the buyer could end up with a bunch of coins they do not want.

I think a multi-pair trading bot would be a better solution for this... I want to accumulate this coin for that coin. Now, bot do your magic! üôÇ something like that was already implemented in MM1 if I rememeber correctly.

[30-Aug-19 04:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
If the purchase price was guaranteed on both sides it really wouldnt matter...
I guess you would execute both trades at the same time.....timestamps and all...
I'm sure there's a way using a crypto condition / deposit half the keys into a p2sh address ...or something
I'm sure there is a way.
CC-Liquid / CC-LP
Just needs to be thought out.

[30-Aug-19 04:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
@jansako

[30-Aug-19 04:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Maybe @jl777c  could clarify the possibility or not

[30-Aug-19 08:22 AM] jansako#3330
I am sure there is a way. Two questions though:

- What is the problem you are trying to solve?
- Is there an easier way to solve it? (Easier means less moving parts = less risk)

[30-Aug-19 04:50 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I guess if either Alice or Bob accept KMD ...using it as an option in the Trading Mechanism-  it would be an easy way to make KMD market makers and a 1 click -3 way trade....

[30-Aug-19 04:53 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The mechanism would be GUI and not marketmaker. I believe searching for the double trade option to make it easier for grandma....

Hello i have some problem to enable `VRCS` and `FTC` through mm2, someone successfully enabled those 2 coins ? (electrum)

```


(i have the same error with SSL) for VRCS and FTC

[02-Sep-19 03:08 PM] Slyris#2880
and there is a way To say to mm2 "i give you this array of server, if you can connect atleast in one, i consider the call successfull" ?

[02-Sep-19 03:08 PM] Slyris#2880
@artem.pikulin  or @artemciy_dice

[02-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Basically i'm parsing the coins repository from @jl777c and give the whole bunch of server each time

[02-Sep-19 03:09 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
If at least 1 server connection will be successful you will get successful response.

[02-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok so VRCS and FTC are down ?

[02-Sep-19 03:09 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
All servers from your list seem to be down, yes.

[02-Sep-19 03:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Erf ok.

[02-Sep-19 03:10 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please check MM2 logs for more info, it should contain some error messages.

[02-Sep-19 03:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok Thank's for your information

[02-Sep-19 03:11 PM] Slyris#2880
What is the env variable to set to have logs ?

[02-Sep-19 03:11 PM] Slyris#2880

Also if you have any issues with electrums please check the addresses manually using:
`echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"server.ping","params":[]}' | nc -v server port`

[02-Sep-19 03:17 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Example of working server:

[02-Sep-19 03:17 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
```
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test","method":"server.ping","params":[]}' | nc -v test1.cipig.net 10025
Connection to test1.cipig.net 10025 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": null, "id": "test"}
```

[02-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Slyris#2880
Oh great

[02-Sep-19 03:17 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
You get the `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": null, "id": "test"}` from server, it's working.

[02-Sep-19 03:17 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok thank's a lot

[02-Sep-19 03:18 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
But for `electrumx-ch-1.feathercoin.ch:50001`:

I think we can do smth with the commit name, so a script can notify if the commit contains `[Breaking]` or smth like this

[03-Sep-19 05:47 AM] Slyris#2880
maybe @TonyL can take care of smth like that

[03-Sep-19 05:48 AM] Slyris#2880
(when a type change in the API basically i would like to be notified since i'm using nightly build of MM2 if there is a change like that it's can break makerbot too

[03-Sep-19 07:32 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Subscribing to the documentation repo should do the trick

[03-Sep-19 07:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Ah ? we can do that ?

[03-Sep-19 09:43 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Slyris We're sending PRs to developer-docs repo when MM2 API is updated. If you start to watch the repo you'll get notification about all PRs and issues created there.

[06-Sep-19 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
@artem.pikulin i see a potential problem with `required_confirmations=2` on chains that do on-demand-mining: on-demand-mining will mine only one block, not 2

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
usually after the first tx makes a new block, there will be notarization

[06-Sep-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if this becomes an issue, we might just need to disable on-demand mining

[09-Sep-19 07:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
On demand mining has been an issue for mm for a long time

[09-Sep-19 07:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For chains with not much usage that is

[09-Sep-19 07:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Even for transactions, normal ones
