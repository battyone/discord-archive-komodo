We don't want the latest. We want to lock it to a tested version for reproducible builds.

[08-Jul-19 10:11 AM] sindresorhus#8187
We will have something like this in package.json to define the mm2 version to download at build-time:

```
"marketmaker": {
        "version": "e31bd721f",
        "hashes": {
            "macos": "a8e998a16faf3092ececacc525f34a1319cfea6a0d71a746d6dca6ae40d7ae875123963abe992bb2d95a7dd7e7a14e882ec53c3fcf1377dc1c190894759e3679",
            "linux": "e45a132cccf805e7f331c91f1e1b400a181494b0fbe351cabf9ec19e5ea0b496cd3738625f2b5bdf7df97756d68c6d9dd4f96a0f41f720294ec7d7625c57db78",

        }
    }
```

The commit hash is received from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, the git version on Linux CI agent is different so it provides shorter result.

[08-Jul-19 10:12 AM] sindresorhus#8187
I see

[08-Jul-19 10:15 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I will set the `--short=9` explicitly so it will always provide same length commit hash, and ok, directory nesting will be removed too.

[08-Jul-19 10:16 AM] sindresorhus#8187
Thanks üòÉ

[08-Jul-19 10:16 AM] sindresorhus#8187
I could of course do it, but that means everyone will have to take into account those inconsistencies. Better to have it it done at the source.

@daemonfox Hi, `it wants to start but says it cant find the COINS file` - https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html#setting-up-the-coin-list, MM2 looks for `coins` file in it's working dir. The recommended coins file to use is https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins

Please try to download/copy this file and put it in MM2 directory.

[10-Jul-19 01:18 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
You may also remove the `userhome` arg from JSON, I think we will deprecate it soon.

[10-Jul-19 01:20 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`tried same as komodod using -arg=VALUE and tried pointing it to the app data dir with MM2.json and these values lik a komod conf file` MM2 doesn't parse the command line arguments passed in `-arg=VALUE` way. Please also make sure that MM2.json file contains the `json`, komodo conf format is `ini` so this won't be accepted by MM2.

[10-Jul-19 01:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
without the userhome arg, where would the default directory be in Win10?

[10-Jul-19 01:37 AM] daemonfox#6136

[10-Jul-19 01:49 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
As I can see `userhome` arg is not really used now and should be deprecated. It was used only for `native` mode, but as of now MM2 will look for daemon config (like `komodo.conf`) in user home directory by default.

[10-Jul-19 03:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
Yes it appears my issue was working directory... oddly enough i can call mm2.exe help from any current directory in cmd... but to launch the actual running daemon in Win10 I had to cd to the folder with the coins file (which also held the binaries) and it launched just fine.

@artem.pikulin Is support for ETH/ERC20 in Electrum mode in mm v2 planned?

[11-Jul-19 03:31 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin mmv1 had a `kickstart` endpoint. I assume that's not needed anymore? I noticed in mmv2 that when I quit during a swap, it automatically resumes when it's started again.

[11-Jul-19 03:45 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin In mmv2 there's a `enable` endpoint, but the inverse is missing. Any plans to add a `disable` endpoint? (This was there in mmv1)

@sindresorhus Hi!
` Is support for ETH/ERC20 in Electrum mode in mm v2 planned?` - as `cipi` explained electrum is not applicable to ETH/ERC20, and yes, there's no need for proxy tokens anymore.
`mmv1 had a kickstart endpoint. I assume that's not needed anymore? I noticed in mmv2 that when I quit during a swap, it automatically resumes when it's started again.` - yes, MM2 kickstarts swaps by itself upon restart, but it needs some help - coins should be enabled to continue the swaps, please call the https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#coins-needed-for-kick-start and enable the returned tickers asap on MM2 start.

`In mmv2 there's a enable endpoint, but the inverse is missing. Any plans to add a disable endpoint? (This was there in mmv1)` - disabling a coin is possible, but will require some effort as we need to take account of following:
1. If there're ongoing swaps with coin the `disable` should be denied for sure.
2. If there're active orders using a coin, what should we do? Cancel them? Or deny `disable` till the orders explicitly canceled by user?

> 2. If there're active orders using a coin, what should we do? Cancel them? Or deny disable till the orders explicitly canceled by user?

I think the API should return an error explaining that there's an order in progress so the user needs to cancel that before disabling the coin.

@artem.pikulin Is it possible to cancel a swap? I tried using the `cancel_order` endpoint using the swap UUID I got from `my_recent_swaps`, but I'm just getting an error:

> Order with uuid 02744126-bf1b-431b-bbae-f0cf397b1ee6 is not found

I assume there's a difference between a swap UUID and order UUID? But how do I convert between the two?

I also noticed `my_recent_swaps` is missing a `cancellable` property to indicate whether it can be cancelled. `my_orders` has this property. Is this intentional or just forgotten?

[12-Jul-19 10:54 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Swap cancel is possible on some stages, it's possible to add RPC method to abort swap if it's not on critical stage, however it will require some effort and refactoring, I think it won't be implemented in near future.

[12-Jul-19 11:00 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It's not very hard to cancel it on the node, but to provide good UX we should also notify the other node that we canceled the ongoing swap, because if we don't have such notification the user might think that app doesn't work and then maybe even submit a bug report about failed swap. And this part is not easy because we don't have such `canceled` notifications between swap participants.

[12-Jul-19 04:18 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin Okey. So for what stages does `cancel_order` currently work? Does it work at all currently? I need to know what stages to disable the cancel button on a swap or if I need to just hide at all together for now.

[12-Jul-19 06:24 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@sindresorhus Hi, `cancel_order` works when cancellable == true, which actually means that order is not being matched right now. Please note also that swap is not order, it's different entity - the result of matching the order with another order.  In your situation when you call `buy/sell` you create the `TakerOrder` that is getting matched and deleted immediately, created swap takes the uuid of the order (it will be changed in the future as current TakerOrder is always `fill`, but the goal is to allow multiple matches for TakerOrder).

[12-Jul-19 06:26 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The MakerOrder is already allowed to have multiple matches, to track swaps created by this order please check https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#response-maker-order, it has 
```
"started_swaps":[
                "60aaacca-ed31-4633-9326-c9757ea4cf78"
            ],

[12-Jul-19 06:27 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
To catch the `cancellable == true` with `buy/sell` you should create the order that is not matching to any existing in the orderbook, it will wait for 30 seconds and then it will be converted to MakerOrder.

[12-Jul-19 06:30 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Summary: when you call `buy/sell` following happens:
1. TakerOrder is created.
2. If order is matched and filled swap is created. Swap takes the uuid of the order. Order is deleted.
3. If order is not matched it can be cancelled. If it's not matched and not cancelled in 30 seconds it's converted to MakerOrder.

[12-Jul-19 06:36 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
4. MakerOrder can be matched with several TakerOrders until it's filled. It might be not cancellable if it has unfinished match(es) - got matching TakerOrder, but swap is not started yet.

@artem.pikulin#0794 I think it's awkward that the order is deleted right after being matched. The current way everything works feels a bit inconsistent. It would be nicer if an "order" existed from you do a buy/sell order all the way until it's done, no matter what. Will that be the case when https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/451 is fixed?

}
```

Where do I put in the `MYTH` contract address? I'm clearly misunderstanding how this all works.

Here's the MYTH token: https://etherscan.io/token/0x277ab4b9dde09a8e710fd755deeb9d0d9532d047

@sindresorhus the contract address is in the coins file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L1260 (example for BAT)
every ERC20 coin on the ETH chain can be enabled with the same urls (`eth1-3.cipig.net:8555`)

@cipi Thanks, that did it. I was fooled into thinking that didn't work initially as some tokens don't work at all: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/464

you need to use `0x277AB4b9DDE09A8E710fd755deeB9d0d9532d047` as MYTH contract address (some chars are upper case)

[14-Jul-19 05:02 PM] cipi#4502
take the value shown on the page https://etherscan.io/address/0x277ab4b9dde09a8e710fd755deeb9d0d9532d047 under `Contract` as contract address, not the address as in the URL

[14-Jul-19 05:05 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@cipi Then a lot of the coins in https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins are incorrect too. Many of the ones I tested that failed are taken directly from there. For example: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/4ecd07f4991ce27eb067e3a025fc2fd593ea7f0f/coins#L1049-L1053

Many of the `etomic` addresses are invalid ¬∑ Issue #332 ¬∑ jl777/...
They are in lowercase-only format, which means they&#39;re not checksummed, but mm2 requires checksummed smart contract addresses. For example: coins/coins Line 1052 in 4ecd07f &quot;etomic...

wen need to test all the coins that worked with mm1 again with mm2... if they are working, they get the setting `"mm2": 1` in the coins file, like in this PR: https://github.com/jl777/coins/commit/97fce4f0f15bed19cf705329985805574cfd59c6
if you find contract addressess that are not working, please make a PR to the above repo

@cipi I would argue this is unrelated. Testing all the coins is going to take forever. This can be fixed pretty easily. If there are lowercase addresses, they need to be changed to the checksummed one.

[14-Jul-19 05:38 PM] cipi#4502
sure, but you need to test the coins anyway before using them in mm2

[14-Jul-19 05:41 PM] cipi#4502
erc20 tokens can change contract address or move to own chain, or some are not working like in mm1, eg USDT... it needs to be tested

[14-Jul-19 05:41 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@cipi I'll do a PR with the smart contract fixes tomorrow.

@artem.pikulin Why is the `avevolume` property of the `orderbook` endpoint marked as deprecated? It's a useful property we use in HyperDEX. Any chance it could be kept?
