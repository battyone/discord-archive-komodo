Although when my node got banned from too much data spam, it crashed, need to build new testing environment to continue.

Hello! Are EOS, Neo, Stellar, or Cardano supported by marketmaker?

[24-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Nabob#5004

@Nabob awesome, thanks!

[24-Oct-18 02:58 PM] luke#8628
I am doing some testing on a private network, and want to set the confirmations to zero like mentioned here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/barterDEX-Whitepaper-v2#zero-transaction-confirmations. I am using this RPC call (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/BarterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category#setconfirms), and when I put in 0 it returns "Success" as I would expect. However, when I go to do the actual swap I can see the "numconfs.1" in the terminal output which means it still waits for a confirmation. I have tested the other way, and set the numconfs to 2 using the same RPC call and that works as expected in the terminal output "numconfs.2". Is setting it to 0 not possible using the endpoint? Is there a different way I can do this?

@luke for zeroconf swaps you need to do this: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/barterDEX-API.html#instantdex-swap
it doesn't work with setconfirms, setconfirms is only for confirmations > 0

[24-Oct-18 03:24 PM] luke#8628
ah, gotcha. thanks!

[25-Oct-18 06:20 AM] k50#7856
Hi is it possible to get a test coin listed on BarterDEX and the dicoApp for learning / experience before doing the dICO for real? Thanks.

[25-Oct-18 10:19 AM] Nabob#5004
Yes, we have test coins available for Beer/pizza or beer/coqui pairs

[25-Oct-18 10:20 AM] Nabob#5004
check for this urls for beer faucets @k50

Hi @Nabob thanks for your reply. I understand there are test coins in existence. Wondering if it is ok to create a new test coin via a test Komodo Assetchain, get it listed on BarterDEX and then probably remove it from BarterDEX once we've learned enough to do the real dICO? This way we can make and learn from all the mistakes on the test coin instead. Thank you.

[26-Oct-18 04:00 PM] tolken#2655
@k50 I‚Äôm not an expert with this, but I don‚Äôt think you need anyone to add it to bdex for you, unless you mean the GUI bdex. I think what you would want to do is add your own assetchain, then configure your instances of BarterDex to use those new assetchains, then trade away.

[26-Oct-18 04:02 PM] tolken#2655
To do this level of testing, would probably be best to do it all command line to keep it simple.

[28-Oct-18 09:48 AM] k50#7856
Hi @tolken, thanks very much for your help!  Ok so I'm following this guide https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/get-listed-barterDEX.html. 

I found rpcport like this:
$ cd ~/komodo/src
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=FC_TEST getinfo
"rpcport": 64015,

I found pubtype like this:
$ cd ~/komodo/src
$ grep -irn pubtype *
komodo_utils.h:46:#define KOMODO_PUBTYPE 60

May I please ask how do I find the values of p2shtype and wiftype? Thanks

[28-Oct-18 03:06 PM] cipi#4502
@k50 for assetchains you don't need this values, all you need is the AC-name and rpcport, so the entry in marketmaker coins file looks like this `{\"coin\":\"DION\",\"asset\":\"DION\",\"rpcport\":23895}`

[29-Oct-18 10:28 AM] k50#7856
Hi @cipi, thank you very much for your kind help.

[30-Oct-18 10:09 AM] luke#8628 (pinned)
After reading some in this channel, I see that there is a mm2! @artem.pikulin , if I want to try it out do I just compile it or grab one of your releases from http://195.201.0.6/etomic/ and replace the "marketmaker" binary with it, and leave everything else the same? or is there a different set of configuration options for it?

[30-Oct-18 10:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794 (pinned)
@luke Hi, these are ongoing nightly builds for internal testing purpose. You can try to use them at your own risk, I wouldn't recommend to use it with real coins and on netid 0. Only testcoins and non-default netids.

[30-Oct-18 11:05 AM] luke#8628
awesome! yes, I will do that. So if I want to try it out on an Ubuntu server I have, I can just take "marketmaker-mainnet-linux-9738ca4" and replace my current marketmaker binary with it using the same command line options?

[30-Oct-18 11:06 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, it should work.

[30-Oct-18 11:07 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
However you won't notice any difference except possibility of additional bugs üòÉ

[30-Oct-18 11:07 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
As we currently porting the existing code to Rust keeping the feature set same.

[30-Oct-18 11:09 AM] luke#8628
üòÉ Makes sense. Really excited about the switch to Rust, and hopefully the additional reliability it will bring!

I have a few questions regarding market stats:
1. Is there a method which will return all trading activity across the network or is that only possible per node?  
2. The ticker method returns trades for the past 24 hours but only for a specific base/rel pair. . . although the doc states that it the base/rel pair is optional but it appears that LP_ticker is always passed base and rel arguments: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_stats.c#L811.  I could be doing something wrong but it doesn't seem to work for me in the generic case where no base/rel pair is specified.
3. Similar to #1, is there a way to get the latest N trades as opposed to the last 24 hours' worth?

Another question - what is the difference between quoteid and requestid?

[31-Oct-18 09:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Matt516 
Hi, as I can see `statsdisp` method matches your requirements (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_commands.c#L422), as you can see the `ticker` method is just a wrapper for  `LP_statslog_disp` with specific hardcoded params. `statsdisp` allows you to get stats for all coins and specific timeframe. As I can see these stats will be displayed for whole network, but you need your node running permanently to collect the stats.

Mm2.0 is on nightlies now? @artem.pikulin I may have to get on that

[01-Nov-18 05:34 PM] luke#8628
@artem.pikulin  thanks again for pointing me to the mm2 binaries. I tested them out and they seem more reliable in some ways. had trouble using a setup with a full relay node in the middle, but without the FR node it worked as expected. Do you have a rough timeline planned for an initial release of mm2? from the github commits I can tell you are hard at work üòÉ

@BlackJesus Hi, please check the messages that I've just pinned. There are nightly builds that have some of parts rewritten in Rust keeping the features (and bugs üòÉ ) same. And maybe it has even more bugs.

For InstantDEX trades (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Processing-InstantDEX-swap-on-barterDEX#instantdex-swap), once you have deposited the KMD, does that give you trust for trading all coin pairs? Or is instantDEX only for trades involving KMD?

[05-Nov-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for all that has a reference price so it can be allocated against the KMD deposit

[05-Nov-18 04:24 PM] luke#8628
very cool! so after a certain number of trades are made with certain coin pairs, they receive an equivalent "value in KMD" that can be used?

[05-Nov-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[06-Nov-18 03:06 PM] luke#8628
followup question... if someone decides to be malicious, and not fulfill their end of the swap during an InstantDEX swap, does the protocol automatically give the instantDEX deposit to the person that was taken advantage of?

[06-Nov-18 03:07 PM] luke#8628
not the whole deposit, but the equivalent amount that the malicious party didn't send?

[06-Nov-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if bob bails out, alice gets the bobdeposit instead of the bobpayment, that is 12.5% more

[06-Nov-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if alice bails, then dexfee is lost

[06-Nov-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
at other stages, the swap is reversed, so there is no gain

[06-Nov-18 03:12 PM] luke#8628
ah, ok. so how do the InstantDEX deposit zcredits play in? those aren't actually taken from the malicious user if they fail their side of the trade right? I'm confused as to why those increase dynamic trust if they can't be claimed by the hacked party

[06-Nov-18 03:13 PM] luke#8628
do they turn into zdebits that the hacker can no longer claim?

[06-Nov-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
an arbiter would need to get involved but only if the atomic protocol doesnt handle it properly. so far it has handled all known swaps (since the last bug was fixed in early summer)

[06-Nov-18 03:18 PM] luke#8628
ok, I think I understand. so when you do an instantdex_deposit, you are transferring control of those KMD coins to the Komodo team until the timelock is released, at which point you can claim them back. if you are malicious, you will start to accrue zdebits that will prevent you from claiming your entire deposit. The komodo team could then give the hacker's locked deposit to the victim.

[06-Nov-18 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is not fully automated but provides a strong disincentive to cheating

[06-Nov-18 03:20 PM] luke#8628
awesome, that makes sense. thanks

[06-Nov-18 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
great questions

[10-Nov-18 12:01 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@luke , excited to see you testing the mm2!
This relay-in-the-middle mode you've mentioned above is not currently a part of our automatic mm2 test harness and I'd like to rectify that. Can you share with me how everything is configured in it?
Which mm2 instances (Alice, Bob, Relay?) are running on an open IP, which are running behind a NAT or firewalled in such a way so as not to be reachable from the outside, which of them have the "client" option on, and how do you point them at each other?
I'd also appreciate it if you would PM me the gist of the mm2 configuration in such a setup.
Thanks for your input.  ‚ù§

[10-Nov-18 05:26 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Im guessing MM2 still requires nanomsg? and curl? will this new MM2 build on android easier than MM1?  I have taken a few months off and need a little info please.

[10-Nov-18 10:26 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@kmdkrazy , we're using the embedded https://hyper.rs/ instead of an external cURL in MM2 now. Going to keep using the nanomsg library for compatibility with the MM1 peers, but we're also making a new networking layer for NAT traversal.
Any problems with building nanomsg on android?
There is a secondary/opportunity goal to make MM easier to port, but as of now we're not targeting the native cross-compilation to android specifically. If you have some experience with cross-compilation and want to try it or give us some hints, it will be, like, totally cool.

[10-Nov-18 11:02 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
@artemciy_dice - just awaiting the tech and devs to focus on portable MM for my project - I hear Rust is similar to Go - I have spent to much money on  DEVs attemting to port  - I guess I will wait for more information on this subject within the next couple months.  One group of Devs wanted to rewrite MM in Go. So I think we are closer than we were. - I will keep researching for solutions on my end as well.  Thank you for the info

[10-Nov-18 11:05 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@kmdkrazy , I'm not yet acquainted with your project. Is it in Go? Would be nice to know about the use case you have in mind.

With the latest release both in marketmaker server and client atomicdex im getting bad performance on swaps.

[11-Dec-18 01:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the swap never ends.

[11-Dec-18 01:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
although it might be an issue with the gui and its interaction with latest release

[11-Dec-18 01:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
did something change? @artem.pikulin

[11-Dec-18 01:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@namhoang28 please, post here any issues you suspect come from the mm

[11-Dec-18 01:22 PM] cipi#4502
@siu - Chainmakers does alice or bob have electrum coins enabled? If so, try without electrum coins. I think it is because mm loads UTXOs in the background for all enabled electrum coins and does too much network traffic, which slows down swaps.

[11-Dec-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
client (alice) is electrum

[11-Dec-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
server is native

[11-Dec-18 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[11-Dec-18 01:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which he suspects is a error decoding from mm

[11-Dec-18 01:25 PM] cipi#4502
yes, but that is because there are still old mm versions in the network, they produce this decoding errors... as long as you don't trade with them, it should not affect you

[11-Dec-18 01:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[11-Dec-18 01:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im sure both server and client are in latest release though.

[11-Dec-18 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
with both new releeases

[11-Dec-18 01:26 PM] cipi#4502
yes, this errors are from the other mms, not your alice or bob

[11-Dec-18 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
swap never started, server reserved it but didnt connect

[11-Dec-18 01:26 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@siu - Chainmakers Hi, I didn't make any changes to swap code, the electrum tx history background loading in theory can cause the issues, however it's impossible to tell anything without full logs from both sides.

[11-Dec-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok, will test again now and post logs.

[11-Dec-18 01:27 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
If it doesn't connect it's highly likely network issue.

[11-Dec-18 01:27 PM] cipi#4502
yes, no connect happens to me when my network is "overloaded"... eg i have to stop my torrent-downloads before trying a swap, else it ends up stuck in connecting

[11-Dec-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hmm, that might be an issue with me then

[11-Dec-18 01:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i might have more than a couple daemons running plus kids watching netflix ;p

[11-Dec-18 01:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but it worked in similar conditions with an earlier release.

[11-Dec-18 01:28 PM] cipi#4502
the daemons should not be a problem though, netflix is it...
