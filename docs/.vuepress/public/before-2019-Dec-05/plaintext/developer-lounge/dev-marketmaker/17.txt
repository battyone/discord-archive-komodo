it was related to average size of the utxos and those are deprecated

[15-Jul-19 02:01 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@sindresorhus Hi, the `cancel_order` endpoint goal is to cancel the not matched Order, not swap. Please do not mix these definitions as these are different entities - Order is orderbook record which might match with other order and then Swap will be created upon successful matching. https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/463 - it works not only for first 30 seconds:
1. `buy/sell` creates TakerOrder, it stays alive 30 seconds if it's not filled. Then it's converted to MakerOrder. 30 seconds is not about cancelability, it's TakerOrder timeout.
2. MakerOrder then stays active until it's filled or cancelled. It might turn no `cancellable = false` if it's matching right now. But if it starts new swap and not completely filled it will stay active and become cancellable again.

As `cipi` mentioned `avevolume` doesn't make any sense now as it means `average utxo size` which is not applicable to MM2 at all. MM2 doesn't need UTXO splitting, it can work if address has only 1 UTXO. So this field will be removed.

[18-Jul-19 10:32 AM] TonyL#3577
it looks like this part of documentation is a little bit outdated and now MM2.json using config instead of CLI params.
Create MM2.json in same directory with mm2 binary with such content:
```
{
"gui":"MM2GUI",
"rpc_password":"yourpassword",
"rpcip":"127.0.0.1",
"netid":9999,
"userhome":"pathtoyourhomedir",
"passphrase":"yourseed",
"rpc_local_only":true
}
```

[18-Jul-19 10:33 AM] jansako#3330
OK

[18-Jul-19 10:33 AM] jansako#3330
what exactly does the userhome looks like? an example, if you have one

[18-Jul-19 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
then launch mm2 just as `./mm2` or `stdbuf -oL ./mm2 &` if you want to issue calls in same terminal window

[18-Jul-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
`what exactly does the userhome looks like? an example, if you have one`
you can check it by `echo $HOME`

[18-Jul-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
or just specify `$HOME` as userhome field attribute

Just put those files into the MM@ folder? Any dependencies? I only have an (updated) base install of 18.04

[18-Jul-19 10:40 AM] jansako#3330
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator your MM2.json does not have the userhome, is that OK?

[18-Jul-19 10:41 AM] jansako#3330
or is the atomicDEX-cli supplying those?

[18-Jul-19 10:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it should give you messages if anything missing. as long as you have coins file, config and mm2 in that folder it should work

[18-Jul-19 10:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

OK, last one for now. If I run the coin daemon in Agama-verus SPV mode (because I like GUI), will that work, or do they all need to run native?

theres a mm2coins.py file, which you can specify electrums for SPV, or specify 'native'
` 'activate_with':'electrum',`
or
` 'activate_with':'native',`

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator this is a really silly question, but with your wrapper, can you skip the start of MM@ altogether? as in start with enabling coins right away?

[18-Jul-19 11:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
use `./atomicDEX-cli start` üëçüèº

[18-Jul-19 11:16 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it logs the mm2 console output, you can tail it in another terminal window

[18-Jul-19 11:33 AM] jansako#3330
OK. having trouble enabling native coins. the mm2coins.py is all electrums. I edited it such:
'tag': 'DEX,
'api-id': 'DEX',
'min swap': 0.1,
'activate_with': 'native',
'rpcport': 11890

[18-Jul-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330

I have the rpc password set in the coin conf and

[18-Jul-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
in MM2.json

[18-Jul-19 11:35 AM] jansako#3330
do I need to set 'rpcuser' in the mm2coins.py as well?

[18-Jul-19 11:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dont think so. I'll try a native on my end and see. Maybe need the userhome for that afterall

[18-Jul-19 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
where would it go? MM2.json?

[18-Jul-19 11:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640

Hi all, having trouble starting MM2 on Ubuntu 18.04.  when issuing ./mm2, the result is:
"mm2:160] mm2:192] expected value at line 1 column 1"

My setup:
mm2 folder on the desktop of Ubuntu, contains coins, mm2 and MM2.json files.

Contents of MM2.json:
(not sure how to paste here so it looks like a code)

{
"gui":"MM2GUI",
"rpc_password":"yourpassword",
"rpcip":"127.0.0.1",
"netid":9999,
"userhome":"pathtoyourhomedir",
"passphrase":"yourseed",
"rpc_local_only":true
}

[19-Jul-19 10:30 AM] jansako#3330
userhome is set to "/home/a/"
password & passphrase are unique

[19-Jul-19 10:31 AM] jansako#3330
coins & mm2 files are dwnloaded form Github, I did not compile mm2.

[19-Jul-19 11:03 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jansako Hi, `coins` file was failed, to parse, please ensure that it contains valid json. How did you create the `coins` file?

[19-Jul-19 11:03 AM] jansako#3330
I did not, downloaded from   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jl777/coins/master/coins

[19-Jul-19 11:04 AM] jansako#3330
ah... I see I think. I just copied the contents & pasted into a text file, then removed the TXT extension.

[19-Jul-19 11:05 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
You could occasionally add some white space upon copy-pasting so it's not valid json now.

[19-Jul-19 11:06 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please just `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jl777/coins/master/coins` at MM2 dir and it should work. Have just worked for me.

thanks @gcharang, my node has been running (& making trades actually! üòÉ )since last week, thanks to smk762. 
The documentation is nice & clear. As a suggestion, I would include a 'best practices' section, with things like:
- placing multiple buys/sells on the same pair without auto-cancelling
- that it is OK to place an order with'the same coins' on multiple pairs (because they are not used up until the trade is initiated)
- security considerations (e.g. Firewalls etc)

that stuff would help not just end users but also devs making the GUI wrappers for MM2,

Hey guys, where can I find some debug outputs for mm2?

I have the output going to terminal but do not read anything worthwhile.

I am swapping 1 coin for another, the order is made and established, then a couple seconds later, the order disappears. The order is being made to myself if that makes a difference.

[23-Jul-19 10:01 PM] cipi#4502
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"method\":\"my_swap_status\",\"params\":{\"uuid\":\"d14452bb-e82d-44a0-86b0-10d4cdcb8b24\"},\"userpass\":\"$userpass\"}"`
where `d14452bb-e82d-44a0-86b0-10d4cdcb8b24` should be replaced by the uuid of the swap you want to examine
