Will the functionality described in this issue https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/328 be similar to getendpoint from MM1's API? @artem.pikulin

@wbradt Hi, no, the MM2 API is very different already so when we implement a kind of push notifications from MM2 to GUI the messages format will be different.

[25-Jun-19 04:13 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks

[25-Jun-19 07:36 PM] dan.#2473
has the networking improved in mm2? do Bobs still crap out after X Alice connections

[25-Jun-19 07:37 PM] dan.#2473
or is scale something yet to be tested

[25-Jun-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
networking massively improved

[25-Jun-19 08:13 PM] dan.#2473
cool

[25-Jun-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
they got even mobile to mobile swaps working

[25-Jun-19 08:14 PM] dan.#2473
is there a plan for the chicken and egg problem in terms of users?

[25-Jun-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
all the recent regulations combined with easy to use GUI, i am more worried about handling the scaling

[25-Jun-19 08:16 PM] dan.#2473
are there are any other Mobile DEXs? Sorry for the plethora of questions

[25-Jun-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but we have tech in progress to handling arbitrary scaling

[25-Jun-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not aware of any other cross chain atomic swap mobile DEX

[25-Jun-19 08:17 PM] dan.#2473
thats interesting. that should not be understated then

[25-Jun-19 08:17 PM] dan.#2473
something gone mobile that is well executed, opens up a whole market

[25-Jun-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we work hard on tech that can get actual usage

[26-Jun-19 03:12 PM] wbradt#2043
For the order_status response, will the keys of "matches" be the same as the elements of "started_swaps"? (For maker orders specifically)

[26-Jun-19 11:40 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Can I please test?

[27-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Oszy#5734
just a note from me, when building mm2 near the end or` cargo build`  
`cmake` it threw and error and halted for `-j 4` as unknown argument. 
it compiled without it fine.

[27-Jun-19 08:10 AM] gcharang#6833
`-j4` without spaces
tells the compiler number of threads to use (optional)

[27-Jun-19 08:16 AM] Oszy#5734
`-j 4` it was like that in the code from git

[27-Jun-19 08:16 AM] Oszy#5734
so that has to be changed then

@wbradt `
For the order_status response, will the keys of "matches" be the same as the elements of "started_swaps"? (For maker orders specifically)` - yes, the keys of matches are same as `started_swaps` for now as swap uuid is equal to taker request uuid. But I think it won't be like this forever as we plan to allow partial match of taker order so we will have to use something different for swap uuid as current approach will produce same uuid for different swaps.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[28-Jun-19 05:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
So you shouldn't treat this like potential uuid of swap if order is matched successfully - it's uuid of `ongoing match` and that's it.

[28-Jun-19 06:06 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin Do you plan to implement the `portfolio` endpoint (from mm v1) in the near future?

[29-Jun-19 12:25 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@sindresorhus Hi, as of now it's not planned to implement it in near future and there's no ETA for it.

[29-Jun-19 03:09 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin Is it possible to get the same data through other (maybe multiple) new mm v2 endpoints or would we have to implement our own Electrum communication?

[29-Jun-19 04:03 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@sindresorhus Our goal is to prevent GUIs from directly accessing coin RPC as we can have many different coin protocols supported and these can have very different APIs. As starting point to replicate the old `portfolio` call you may use `my_balance` - https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#my_balance.

[29-Jun-19 04:03 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also it's easy to add a call that will return all balances of enabled coins, but this call will take some time to run as MM2 will request the balance on demand from RPCs, caching is not implemented yet

[29-Jun-19 04:03 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Could you please clarify what info do you require from portfolio?

[29-Jun-19 04:30 PM] sindresorhus#8187
We use the `portfolio` endpoint for the balance, and price for currencies not on Coingecko.

[29-Jun-19 04:33 PM] sindresorhus#8187
So the missing thing is to get an endpoint to get the price.

[29-Jun-19 04:47 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
So for coins not present on coingecko you need to get the exchange rate with some known coin (presumably BTC or KMD)? And it will be best price available on current orderbook, correct?

[29-Jun-19 04:48 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Yes, we currently use the `price` field here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/BarterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category#portfolio

[29-Jun-19 04:49 PM] sindresorhus#8187
It would also be useful with an endpoint to get a list of the enabled currencies. We already have this locally, but there's a risk of the app getting out of sync with mm. Would be nice if mm could be the source of truth for that.

[29-Jun-19 04:49 PM] sindresorhus#8187
I'm happy to open issues for these suggestions if you want?

[29-Jun-19 04:49 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Sure, let's start with this simple one, getting list of all enabled coins will be easy to add.

[29-Jun-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if mm2 isnt already getting prices externally, it seems to make more sense for the gui to be getting prices from external sites

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Jun-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the best orderbook price can be returned, but that wont necesarily be the best price

[29-Jun-19 04:55 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@jl777c What did mm v1 use as the basis for the `price` field for coins not on CMC/Coingecko?

[29-Jun-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
it used internal prices

[29-Jun-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
that is sees on the network

[29-Jun-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but that can be easily manipulated

[29-Jun-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i would suggest using an external reference

[29-Jun-19 04:58 PM] sindresorhus#8187
But we can't realistically hook up the app to separate APIs for each coin, so we have to use an API like Coingecko. So the result then is that we don't support prices for such coins.

[29-Jun-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it is hard to have a function that uses internal if external is not available?

[29-Jun-19 05:00 PM] sindresorhus#8187
That's what we already do. We use Coingecko whenever possible and fall back to the price given by mm.

[29-Jun-19 05:01 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
As I understand the main purpose is approximate estimation of total portfolio value in USD, for coin not present on CMC/Gecko we can add a kind of `bestprices` call that will return just best price if there're any orders.

[29-Jun-19 05:01 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
But also you can get this info from the corresponding `orderbook`.

[29-Jun-19 05:02 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin Correct

[29-Jun-19 05:02 PM] sindresorhus#8187
A `bestprices` endpoint would be very useful.

[29-Jun-19 05:04 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
So is it like `bestprices(KMD)` to get the best prices of all enabled coins in pair with KMD?

[29-Jun-19 05:07 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Yes, the current API also returns the price relative to KMD.

[29-Jun-19 05:11 PM] sindresorhus#8187
I opened a couple of issues about these things.

[29-Jun-19 05:11 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Just wanted to say that the mm v2 is looking very good and it's super fast.

[29-Jun-19 05:13 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Thanks! `enabled_coins` is very easy so will be done right after weekend, `bestprices` will require a bit more effort, but I guess I will have some time for this on next week.

[29-Jun-19 05:14 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Thanks üòÉ

[29-Jun-19 05:16 PM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin Is `order_status` the correct endpoint to track updates for a swap? I'm trying to replace the mm v1 websocket code we have for tracking swap progress. Was not clear if it's that one or `my_swap_status` (what is the difference?)

[29-Jun-19 05:20 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Swap is result of matching `the order`, so these are different entities. As of now if you're acting as `taker` there's really not that much differerence between order and swap. Taker request is `fill` only and swap uuid will be equal to uuid of the order - only 1 swap can start by matching the taker request.

[29-Jun-19 05:21 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Ok, thanks.

[29-Jun-19 05:21 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#response-maker-order - but maker order can already have multiple matches so you need to track the `order_status` at least to know  what swaps has been started by it.

https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md - and also Taker order status response already has `matches` - we will allow taker order to partially match and start multiple swaps in the near future.

[29-Jun-19 05:25 PM] sindresorhus#8187
So if I do a `buy` order, I get a response with a `uuid` back. I tried using that `uuid` for `order_status`, but the order is not found. I must be missing something.

[29-Jun-19 05:25 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
If the order is matched it's removed immediately, please try to call `my_swap_status` with same uuid.

[29-Jun-19 05:31 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
It's a bit tricky situation as of now, MM2 doesn't persist the order history yet, `order_status` returns the active order info, but if it's matched it's not active anymore.

[29-Jun-19 05:32 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
And it matches quite fast usually so yes, you might not have enough time to catch the `order_status` üôÇ

[29-Jun-19 05:34 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
But if it's not matched it will stay online for 30 seconds and then be recreated as maker order.

[29-Jun-19 05:34 PM] sindresorhus#8187
I see. So I cannot really rely on `order_status` then, since I have to be sure I catch it.

[29-Jun-19 05:35 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Is persistence of `order_status` something that will be implemented in the short term?

[29-Jun-19 05:36 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Maybe after `enabled_coins` and `bestprices` üôÇ

[29-Jun-19 05:36 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Ok, thanks.

[29-Jun-19 05:42 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
We will have to persist the `order_history` sooner or later so it'll be done for sure. As of now you have to follow these steps: create order -> check order_status -> if there's no order check my_swap_status with same uuid -> if swap is not found there's something unexpected.

[29-Jun-19 05:43 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hopefully it doesn't add too much code.

[29-Jun-19 05:43 PM] sindresorhus#8187
Ok, thanks for talking me through this.

[29-Jun-19 05:45 PM] artem.pikulin#0794

@sindresorhus check out `my_recent_swaps` - it is very reliable for order status tracking.

@SHossain Hello üëã,

I work with the Chaincoin community and one of our devs is interested in the new atomic api announced today. 

How can I get more information or documentation to share with them. They built our explorer and are looking to build atomic swap capabilities into the explorer.

Thanks for sharing and for building an open framework with shared liquidity!üí™üèªüëçüèª

@artem.pikulin I noticed the Linux build name has a shorter Git hash than Windows and macOS:

mm2-e31bd72-Linux.zip
mm2-e31bd721f-Windows_NT.zip
mm2-e31bd721f-Darwin.zip

At http://195.201.0.6/mm2/

Could you make them have the exact same hash? It's weird that they differ and it makes it slightly harder to make a build script that downloads them.

[08-Jul-19 10:10 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@sindresorhus Hi, you may download the latest nightly by special links: http://195.201.0.6/mm2/mm2-latest-Linux.zip, http://195.201.0.6/mm2/mm2-latest-Darwin.zip, http://195.201.0.6/mm2/mm2-latest-Windows_NT.zip.

[08-Jul-19 10:10 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@artem.pikulin And for Linux and macOS build ZIP files, can you remove the directory nesting? `./target/debug/mm2` => `./mm2`?
