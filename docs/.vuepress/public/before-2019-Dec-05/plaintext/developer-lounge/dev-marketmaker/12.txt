i think the problem that bob waits that long for bobdeposit is because of the changes to the "confirmations" field in komodod... it waits for a notarization... which is ok, but it means the swaps take 15 minutes to complete... a possible solution is modifying mm to look after "rawconfirmations" instead of "confirmations"

@artem.pikulin Do you maybe know why the _current_ marketmaker sais things like:

```Could not find tx out: 6ac750fa6eac02b33fd5edf51c84b83d6721a2648107fab20e9521825812c5c3 1

? I'm so curious... Can't find it.

[29-Dec-18 11:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@bartwr Hi, the Bob doesn't recognize that Alice utxo is available for some reason. It's hard to say more without debugging, MM2 won't have this issue for sure because we're removing utxo selection/validation from ordermatching at all. How much time do you have to wait for MM2?

@artem.pikulin This is the official description of the script flag so it’s strange that komodo atomic swap script doesn’t comply with the latest implementation of bitcoin scripting

[05-Jan-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That Myce fork of PIVX fork of Dash fork of Bitcoin doesn't work on given try x doesn't mean that "komodo atomic swap script doesn’t comply with the latest implementation of bitcoin scripting"

[05-Jan-19 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it could be as simple as your wallet isn't properly signing the tx

@bitcoinsfacil - pedro [MYCE] Hi, Segwit is not supported currently, it's planned to support it in later in MM2 (but it's not a first priority task), it's enough to send standard P2SH outputs usually. I see this error for first time and suspect that MYCE is doing custom script validation that appears to be not backward-compatible. I'll need some time to debug this issue, going to do it when MM2 alpha is released.

[05-Jan-19 03:12 PM] bitcoinsfacil - pedro [MYCE]#0336
Thanks @artem.pikulin will look into this

[05-Jan-19 03:13 PM] Master Den#8523
@artem.pikulin when will the MM2 alpha released ? Any ETA ?

[05-Jan-19 03:22 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Master Den Hi, we don't have precise ETA, nightly builds with some parts rewritten in Rust are already available here: http://195.201.0.6/etomic/, however these do not differ a lot from MM1. I think we will have a version with significant changes in January (but it will be far away from being ready for production usage), it will include:
1. Libtorrent DHT as networking layer for swap.
2. New simplified swap protocol (no need for 212% for bob side).
3. No need for ETOMIC for ETH/ERC20 swaps.
4. Many other changes in codebase: less C, more Rust.
It won't have a lot of features of MM1 but basic trading functionality will be available.

[13-Jan-19 10:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Would it be feasible to integrate MM2 into OpenBazaar? They have crypto-crypto buying now, often through an escrow, and as a server it need to be up at all times. There are always listings which seems like there is always liquidity, so if they were running MM2, their users could skip escrow and use atomic swaps to buy, and HyperDEX and BarterDEX would have more liquidity by sharing their order books which gives users someone to trade with.

[13-Jan-19 10:17 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't know how technically difficult it would be to do something like this though

[13-Jan-19 10:37 PM] tolken#2655
Once mm2 is online, there won’t be much of a liquidity problem.@Regnar

[13-Jan-19 10:54 PM] cipi#4502
@tolken why do you think mm2 would make any difference regarding liquidity? My impression is that there is no liquidity because poeple are not willing/able to rent a server and install mm on it.

[13-Jan-19 10:57 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 allows nodes behind a NAT to be bob

[13-Jan-19 10:59 PM] SHossain#0007

yep 😃

[13-Jan-19 11:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Even then, the stats look pretty good for OpenBazaar as a P2P marketplace and escrow makes sense for real world items, but it seems better to use something like mm2 for crypto to crypto (maybe eventually digital assets if that's in the future for us) and providing that service could be  good for liquidity and to help get KMD on their platform.
What I'm looking at for stats. <https://openbazaar.com/discover/stats>

[14-Jan-19 01:53 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi I ran mm for maybe 6 months or longer for virtually all combinations of btc/bch/kmd/eth/ltc/ had couple tokens in there too. Had enough in there for people to trade and was ready to add more. When it got to a point when there were literary days that went by when there was at best 1 trade on bdex followed by days of no trades, that’s a fairy good sign that liquidity isnt the primary issue. When you have kmd veterans asking to buy kmd otc instead of using bdex despite the fact that I’d tell them there was plenty in bdex,, liquidity isn’t the issue. Consistency and stability of trade completion is the primary barrier to adoption. Once that’s in place; everything else will follow. I only took mine down temporarily as I needed the funds elsewhere, but I plan to get it back up soon.

[14-Jan-19 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
After, literally, having completed tens of thousands of swaps, I'd have to disagree with the claim that "trade completion is the primary barrier to adoption"

[14-Jan-19 02:03 AM] tolken#2655
Lots of beer and pizza, assetchain swaps..

[14-Jan-19 02:05 AM] tolken#2655
I’ve completed all of the pairs listed above, but I’ve witnessed many attempts and failures, and a lot of that echoed in HyperDex support. It just doesn’t work reliably enough yet. It isn’t difficult to use, it just doesn’t work consistently for most people.

[14-Jan-19 02:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, "the primary barrier to adoption" is that people expect it to be and function in a manner that it isn't and will not
People mentally expect it to work like a CEX and since it doesn't they give up real quick

[14-Jan-19 02:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
HyperDex isn't BarterDEX and brings its own issues to the table

[14-Jan-19 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and, for the record, only 5 of my swaps were ever BEER or PIZZA outside of the initial testing of them and those swaps weren't even in my count

[14-Jan-19 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
does mm1 have issues? yes
are those issues broadly related to trade *completion*? no

Changing to a different networking layer will fix 90% of what Tolkien is talking about

[14-Jan-19 04:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Hi, MM2 is in progress, by `3) No need for ETOMIC for ETH/ERC20 swaps.`I mean that ETOMIC won't participate anymore in ETH/ERC20 swaps. The ETOMIC is used in MM1 as proxy coin, it was the simplest way to integrate ETH as MM1 was designed taking into account UTXOs coins only. So in real there are 2 transactions happening when you swap BEER/ETH for example: ETOMIC transaction is sent first and then ETH/ERC20 with same hash/time lock parameters.

[14-Jan-19 04:34 AM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 Your experience was apparently different than mine. I agree, HyperDex came with its own  baggage, but using cli to manually trade was only moderately more successful during my use.  Maybe it’s what blakjokr eluded to regarding the network. It certainly wasn’t primarily because of liquidity, that’s the point I hope to make here.

[14-Jan-19 05:12 AM] Regnar#6164
To clarify here, more liquidity providers was what I was suggesting here in this channel when I asked if it was feasible to have OpenBazaar integrate MM2. But that's outside my expertise, I'm mostly considering the benefits of LPs, shared liquidity, access to their marketplace, KMD integration, marketing and interop elements. Just thought talking about that wouldn't be on topic for this channel.

[14-Jan-19 08:14 AM] jorian#4555
not to be picky, but this ```11:57 PM] jl777c: mm2 allows nodes behind a NAT to be bob
[11:59 PM] SHossain: home users can be bob
[11:59 PM] SHossain: no server needed```, especially what shossain said, was already possible in mm1

[14-Jan-19 08:14 AM] jorian#4555
only there was never a GUI for it to make it easy, other than the reference gui satinder made

[14-Jan-19 08:15 AM] jorian#4555
so mm2 can have a NAT and that's fine and all, but if there is no GUI, there will be less bobs.

[14-Jan-19 08:15 AM] jorian#4555
also bear market

[14-Jan-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
```People mentally expect it to work like a CEX and since it doesn't they give up real quick``` a CEX *always* works. if a DEX doesn't work 1/100, people give up and go back to CEX where it always works. In the end, we're talking about financial assets that we're trading. So either we need to educate the masses really well that a DEX might fail sometimes, or we make mm2 so reliable that it practically fails as often as a CEX

[14-Jan-19 02:06 PM] crypto999#4866
@artem.pikulin so for MM2 are ETH/EC20 not managed in a UTXO-dependent manner?

[15-Jan-19 11:53 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Yes, the swap and coin interaction part is rewritten from scratch, we're getting rid of stric UTXO dependency in code. The goal is to ease the support on any coin independently on underlying technology. And it's  simply done by usage of Rust traits: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/lp_coins.rs#L80, https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/lp_coins.rs#L161, https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/lp_coins.rs#L194. Particular implementation like UTXO coin or ETH need just to implement few functions and then it almost magically works for whole MM as top level code works with abstractions.

[15-Jan-19 01:35 PM] crypto999#4866
@artem.pikulin Does that go for the SHA256 coins - as in a move to a balance-based system overall, or just when using non-compatible coins?

[15-Jan-19 01:36 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Excuse me, I didn't understand your question, how is SHA256 related to discussed topic?

[15-Jan-19 01:40 PM] crypto999#4866
Sorry, probably not explaining myself very well. I meant would MM (so BarterDEX) be using a balance-based system moving forward for all coins or still be UTXO-based for the likes of BTC/LTC/KMD (SHA256/Scrypt coins).

[15-Jan-19 01:46 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 MM2 will work with any coin supporting hash/timelocked transactions. It won't have strict UTXO dependency or balance-based dependency or something else. But for our convenience we use abstract `balance` e.g. for displaying purposes, etc. UTXO coins doesn't have `balance` in same meaning as ETH, but it can be easily calculated by summing address utxos amounts.

[15-Jan-19 01:49 PM] crypto999#4866
@artem.pikulin Thanks!!!

[15-Jan-19 03:03 PM] crypto999#4866
Is MM2 release still looking likely for January?

[15-Jan-19 03:40 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Yes, please consider this as `very early` alpha that is safe to use with test coins like BEER and PIZZA only. The real production `release` will be much later.

[15-Jan-19 03:43 PM] crypto999#4866
Righty. Understand...

[16-Jan-19 08:03 AM] Mylo#8306
@jorian I think “reliably” is the keyword for bob at home.  How many routers did you try ? 😜

[18-Jan-19 07:09 PM] wbradt#2043
@artem.pikulin You said MM2 "won't have strict UTXO dependency or balance-based dependency." Does this remove the need for UTXOs to match perfectly?

[18-Jan-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
even in mm1 utxo dont have to match perfectly

[18-Jan-19 07:16 PM] wbradt#2043
ok. Will mm2 contain improvements for UTXO splitting?

[18-Jan-19 07:18 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[19-Jan-19 10:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Hi, yes, there is no split in MM2 at all. It selects the UTXO right before sending the required transaction, example in code: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L444, we first get the address unspents from RPC sorted in ascending order. Then we add the UTXO as input to spending transaction until we collect required output amount: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L193. This way we're eager to `merge`utxos instead of split, the address can have single UTXO and trade without additional actions.

@artem.pikulin Does this mean that the size of the UTXOs in my wallet would not matter? i.e. Could I trade any amount of currency regardless of the sizes of my UTXOs?

And will traders need to specify if they want to provide or take liquidity before they place a trade?

[23-Jan-19 05:18 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Hi, yes, it's correct, UTXO size doesn't matter, if the collected amount is bigger than required the difference will be transferred back to your address. Native wallets usually generate new `change` address for this purpose, but it's not possible in MM for now.

[23-Jan-19 05:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`And will traders need to specify if they want to provide or take liquidity before they place a trade?` - it will work same as on CEX, e.g. if you put `good till cancelled` order that doesn't immediately match you automatically become `Liquidity Provider`.

[23-Jan-19 05:20 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
If you put an order that matches already existing then you're `Liquidity taker`.
