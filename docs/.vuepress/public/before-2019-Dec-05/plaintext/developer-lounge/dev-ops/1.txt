@Mylo inviting you here since @Deleted User mentioned that you're interested in containerisation as well.

[18-Nov-18 11:46 AM] ns408#8889
@SHossain are you able to set up a title for this channel please "Conversations related to containerisation (docker, kubernetes)"

@patchkez @Mylo @Deleted User 

I'm trying to answer the following questions and open to your input:
- Do we want to use a publicly accessible trello board for managing the tasks related to containerisation: https://trello.com/b/lrL1g3Es
_I'm open to using git project if we have majority suggesting to go with it.
- Which repo would we like to focus on for this work?
- How can we be transparent about the number of hours each of us has each weeks to work on different tasks
- I'm trying to think about the higher level vision of what we want to achieve as part of this exercise. Eg. We want to be able to quickly launch semi baked containers on both local machines for testing and in production on schedulers like k8 or openshift.
- Then, it would be worthwhile to think about what strategy we want to undertake. Eg. Initially, we may just look at the work that @Deleted User and @patchkez did to containerise things and see what's remaining if we were to put that work to use in a new test environment. And we can define tasks from there.

Also, I'm very open to suggestions and changes that can actually help us stay motivated, consistent and get *actual results* - not just for ourselves but for any new person who comes alone for the ride.

Organize anything, together. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, know what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

@blackjok3r @Decker 
Just an FYI with this stuff - _going forward, I have every intention to containerise some (if not everything) of the amazing stuff that you guys have created so I'd just like to keep you wonderful people in the loop_

[18-Nov-18 11:59 AM] ns408#8889
Why do we need containerisation:

- On komodoplatform, we run a whole range of chains which get compiled, configured and deployed differently. Each of these may have different dependencies and it gets harder to test things *in isoltation* when we deploy all of these on a single server. We  would like to handle this problem through containerisation where self container docker images can be used to launch containers which work exactly the same irrespective of underlying operating system (_and it's version_).
- Compilation takes a while and occasionally we see 3rd party packages being missed. We would like to keep dockerhub images which have compiled version that can just be used without any fuss.
- Local testing on your laptops gets easier because you can just work with a container, make changes and then get it deployed onto your production environment.

[18-Nov-18 12:00 PM] ns408#8889
@SHossain Is there a way some of us can have admin rights over this channel. If not, it's cool. Then I'm gonna have to bug you now and then for requests such as:
- could you please pin the above post so that people can read why we're wanting to do this.

[18-Nov-18 12:05 PM] patchkez#5349
@ns408 I am fine with the name for this channel. I am also fine with trello, used some other tracking tools in the past, but think trello is fine

[18-Nov-18 12:06 PM] patchkez#5349
what do you mean by using git? you meant to use github issues to track work?

I made few poor decisions in how I use all containers together, @Deleted User made it better. e.g. I have to re-build iguana image when I want to add new coin

[18-Nov-18 12:11 PM] patchkez#5349
IMHO we should first create plan/vision how our platform should look like, and from that create individual tasks

[18-Nov-18 12:11 PM] patchkez#5349
I have plan already in my head for longer time, I can write it down somewhere and we can discuss it

[18-Nov-18 12:12 PM] patchkez#5349

Yes, that's what - but let's just start with trello and we'll see how things go.

>all coins which are run on NN are containerized. But improvement is needed here. This is up-to-date repo and I run this on my NN https://github.com/patchkez/kmdplatform

Great! We can always improve and even refactor things if needed. Great to have a really good, tested starting point though - thanks to you.

That's cool. We'll learn from it and refactor things to make it better.

Absolutely, let's just start populating a few cards. I'm just gonna pop a card on the board so that you can put your plan in there and we can then look at either adding "docs" directory in your git repo later.

you can take a tar backup of your system for example

[18-Nov-18 06:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
actually... can you take an image of your MyLinuxOS 1.1 ?

[18-Nov-18 06:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
because the way to do what you want is the actual docker import cmd

Create a base image
Most Dockerfiles start from a parent image. If you need to completely control the contents of your image, you might need to create a base image instead. Here’s the difference:...
https://docs.docker.com/favicons/docs@2x.ico

[18-Nov-18 06:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
as i said, basically you need to take a tar image of your working MyLinuxOS 1.1 and then import -> that creates a base image

[18-Nov-18 06:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
after that you can build it, and preferably add it to dockerhub

[18-Nov-18 06:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
that way when you write Dockerfiles you do FROM ComputerGenie/MyLinuxOS:v1.1

For others (_look at this channel_), I will try to capture some of the requirements / concerns / improvements being mentioned here at least a few times in a week.
It would be great if those raising them can just draft those as issues - we can then take things from there.
Please do note that at the moment, we're really trying to focus on containerisation from Notary Node perspective but in the process, we'll be either listing or creating artefacts that can be used by others for testing or launching these komodoplatform (and thirdparty) resources quickly.

At the moment, we're working from @patchkez 's repository so submitting an issue request there will be helpful.
Also, we're tracking our work through and currently there's nothing on there but in the next week or so, we'll have more cards that will reflect our direction: https://trello.com/b/lrL1g3Es/containerisation

I asked this question originally but this got created under 3rd party - which isn't too bad. Once we prove our intent and have something to show for, we can then ask for this channel to exist under core, or technology or where ever contributors find it to be suitable later on.

There won't even be git in there. The only benefit from alpine afaik is that it is very light weight. For KMD purposes ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 as a base will be better I think

Ok going back to Ubuntu thx

[14-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Mylo#8306
Still handy for a nodejs app I think.  The alpine packaging seems pretty straight forward however, once the base Ubuntu layer is on user machine, the d/l and storage is already a “sunk cost”

[14-Dec-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you could get it to build, but it wouldnt be easy

[14-Dec-18 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had komodo building on Arch a few versions ago, but now it just errors out like crazy again. it seems to be mostly newer GCC that complains more than older versions.

[14-Dec-18 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Best to stick with whatever the devs are using, so I just use 16.04 server VM that has all deps, and copy it. only a 10GB image, and you can copy it anywhere.

Yes agree.   The benefits are lost with any time lost to things that have been solved or are not a problem elsewhere.
