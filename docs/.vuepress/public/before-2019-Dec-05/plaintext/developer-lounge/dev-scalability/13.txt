not sure this will be much of an issue either way

[04-Jun-18 01:07 PM] jl777#0000
yes at first the blocks come faster

[04-Jun-18 01:07 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ok. its just that the blocks for 1 payment are not totally full 100% of the time, when blocks are that fast.

[04-Jun-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#0000
but the TX/s will be much higher than expected in that time.

[04-Jun-18 01:25 PM] jl777#0000
currently average BTC is still less than 3 payments, but this will change over time

[04-Jun-18 01:25 PM] jl777#0000
i think 15 minutes for each test is good

[04-Jun-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Also going to test a version that uses timestamp to calculate starting time. I think polling a webserver 16000 times a minute might be a bottleneck.

[04-Jun-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Also going to test a version that uses timestamp to calculate starting time. I think polling a webserver 32000 times a minute might be a bottleneck.

[04-Jun-18 03:21 PM] jl777#0000
polling even 100 times a minute seems overkill

[04-Jun-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The script checks on each block for a file of a webserver to tell it to start

[04-Jun-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#0000
because there is 16000+ continers, and block time is 30s

[04-Jun-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it could get overloaded. Going to test timestamp condition just so we have a backup plan.

[04-Jun-18 04:04 PM] imylomylo#0000
sounds like a fun challenge.  what's the trigger?

[04-Jun-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#0000
both methods seem to work fine

[04-Jun-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#0000
sorry I am here

[04-Jun-18 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#0000
for time stamp

[04-Jun-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#0000
for using website. Currently pulls from git, but I am not sure that will work. We like the website version better as we can manually start it whenever we are ready. but using a timestamp, we dont know exactly what time all the chains will be ready, so it will likley cost more $$$, because everything will need to be runnign for quite a long time, before blast is started.

[04-Jun-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#0000
if we miss time the blast... it will require starting everything from the start again.

[04-Jun-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#0000
```#fetch the start variable, if we have a start block height then the blaster will start
if [ $start -eq 0 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  curl $STARTURL -o start
  sleep 1
  exit
elif [ $start -eq 1 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "startblockheight=$HEIGHT" > startblockheight
  sleep 1
  exit
fi```

[04-Jun-18 04:06 PM] blackjok3r#0000
```#check the time, if we have a start block height then the blaster will start
if [ $start -eq 0 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  #block=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT)
  time=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT | jq -r .time)
  if [ $time -ge $STARTTIME ]; then
    echo "start=1" > start
  fi
  sleep 1
  exit
elif [ $start -eq 1 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "startblockheight=$HEIGHT" > startblockheight
  sleep 1
  exit
fi```

[04-Jun-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#0000
getting 8196 chains to do the same thing at the same time, is going to be the hardest part of the process.

[04-Jun-18 04:07 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Hopefully everything can be bactched up so we can test a small verison with say 1024 chains then just x8 that for full test.

[05-Jun-18 12:08 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
blackjok3r - could you set a condition to start 4 times as many needed to ensure a perfect blast condition? Duplicates would get ignored... and then sync the timestamps for the usable nodes in the background? .... stager the times out to optimal running conditions for the hardware - dupliucate sync and adjust with scripts ....redundancy ...

[05-Jun-18 12:14 AM] kmdkrazy#0000

i can make a quick howto so you can control deployment of this mechanism with only activation blackjok3r - costs about $0.20 for 1 million requests.

[05-Jun-18 12:17 AM] imylomylo#0000
if you wanted to stagger chain start up into clusters of 64, e.g. group1, 2, 3, 4 to start at different blockheights, just adjust the activation json object accordingly with your own key/value scheme

[05-Jun-18 12:20 AM] imylomylo#0000
kmdkrazy i haven't looked into how jok3r is doing.

scales to buggery

[05-Jun-18 12:20 AM] imylomylo#0000
no db or anything, just a big function running infrastructure

[05-Jun-18 12:40 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
I would stager according to CPU/RAM usage / im sure there is going to be a wavelength yet to be disvovered..  - break it down to rediculas - 8 chains every 1 second for 8 seconds - would be an example - keep peak usage at 60-70% ish.  Then multiply it out from there- and im not sure how hes d

[05-Jun-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Yes, I thaught about something like this, because the CPU use doesn't actaully stay flat, each chain has bursts of CPU use then sits basically idle for a while. I was going to just cram as many chains onto a single vCPU as I could that kept the mempool full. I don't think staggering them by much will be needed, because using blocktime as a the condition of when events are called, they will already be randomly selected over a few minutes.

[05-Jun-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Sweet I will have a look at that. if we can basically Ddoss it from every node, fetching a 7 byte file this is the perfect solution.

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Also I don't think having 2x the amount of chains is really feasible.

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
Its random with the conditions beung used

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The system is so simple, it should not have any errors. As long as they can al be told to "start" at the same time, the blocktime's will ensure all chains are staggered out.

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
Im just thinking 2 gatlung guns aimed at thge sane target 'nay" have less errors

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Also if 2 chains happen to call "block mine" and "blast loop" on the exact same second, I assume one will gain priotity and finish first, and the next time these events are called, they will be at differing times.

[05-Jun-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
There is already 2 blasters for singel payment TX

[05-Jun-18 12:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but for 100paymetn TX I removed the second one, because it was causing mempool to get blasted to 50MB in some cases.

[05-Jun-18 12:58 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
I just imagined your situatiin and tried to remove that probkem.

[05-Jun-18 12:58 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
Just a back up for each - just in case and stagered to keep things from piling up

[05-Jun-18 12:59 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
My epiphany of the week - ...until next time...im out

[05-Jun-18 01:05 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
And if you have 2 identical twins - maybe you can use half from each to keep mempool down - in a redundant system that is

[05-Jun-18 01:05 AM] kmdkrazy#0000
No im out

[05-Jun-18 01:11 AM] imylomylo#0000
have you got an aws account, that way you can manage the whole thing.  if not, i can create an IAM role (sub-account) for you to deploy and make changes as needed without needing me in the path to restarts etc.  first option is quicker, i'm not familiar with IAM roles so much.

[05-Jun-18 01:15 AM] smk762#0000

HAHAHA

[05-Jun-18 01:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We need an archtecture diagram, for AWS. I have a meeting on thursday morning. Should I use your meme version? 
Do you think they will get a laugh out of it. Might need to write a page with written explanation too though.

[05-Jun-18 01:21 AM] smk762#0000
can use it, though probably stuff to add outside what I see from my side. form Lionel Richie onward, it's not AWS. Could migrate, but it'd mean a bit of time installing node modules, db etc.

[05-Jun-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
There is no need to change your stats stuff to all AWS.

[05-Jun-18 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Once AWS has got all the data anything would work from there on.

[05-Jun-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the biggest thing is getting all that data at once so you can use it. AWS seems close to the only solution to this.

[05-Jun-18 01:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We will also play the card, that we used google on the first test, but we can make it much better on Amazon. I think thats a good idea.

[05-Jun-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#0000
This test needs an incredible amount of hardware infrastructure...

[05-Jun-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I wonder if they even have enough of it tbh. 🤔

[05-Jun-18 01:29 AM] smk762#0000
its not a roadmap, is a star chart

depends how much adaptability we want querying the data.

[05-Jun-18 04:48 AM] imylomylo#0000
Go to YourName -> My Security Credentials.

Then quickest easiest "less safe" but less complicated method to get started is to go to "Access Keys" and create a new set of access keys.

Keep them safe.

You'll get an "Access Key ID" and a "Secret Access Key"

all i really need is something that gives me all records since a timestamp

[05-Jun-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah DB should be able to do that surely?

[05-Jun-18 04:48 AM] smk762#0000

[05-Jun-18 04:50 AM] smk762#0000

so need maybe 2000 record limit

[05-Jun-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
