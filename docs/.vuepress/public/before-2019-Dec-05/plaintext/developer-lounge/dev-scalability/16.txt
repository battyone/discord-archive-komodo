Hmm... I think maybe the variance I was getting too might have been the stats failing to submit.... for now I just put `&` at the end of the curl commands so the script can just continue if anything fails.

[14-Jun-18 04:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Testing this soon, if not, I have an idea to make `start=1` instead `start=timestamp_to_start_at`

[14-Jun-18 04:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the pause mining will be calculated from that time, so all blasters start with a full mempool within  1 minute of each other they all start mining blocks.

[14-Jun-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the URL is passed by docker-compose so its shouldnt be too hard to have X of them 😃

[14-Jun-18 04:13 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - if we need, we can check the curl command response code, and make some decisions to repost, or write to file and repost or something

yup

[14-Jun-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The idea is to have 64 chains working perfectly with notarization... then just deploy as many of these 64 batch clusters into EKN to make up the rest of the chains needed to reach 1 million Tx/s

[14-Jun-18 04:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
scales linear, so it should be easy to calibrate how much stuff we need.

[14-Jun-18 04:16 AM] Mylo#8306
cool - i've got a service provider with physical servers that wants to get involved, so dockerizing is a winner here !

Does anyone know if this is a reasonable assumption about AWS?
64 vCPU instance is $3 per hour, so thats ~$0.047 (4.7c per hour) Per CPU.
If we need 8196 vCPU's  it would only be $385 per hour? 
If this is about right, then this will be no worries to run for a few hours?

[14-Jun-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <patchkez> @Mylo(KomodoPioneers) this is the curl Docker image you requested for testing requests against DynamoDB
https://github.com/patchkez/scaletest_containers/tree/master/dynamodb_requests_testing
you can start 8196 containers, or you can modify docker-compose and leave there only few chains. Curl is executed with 0.1s delay in the loop. If you need to deploy it on some faster HW, let me know, I will be glad to help.

[slack] <patchkez> @blackjok3r count with only how many instances we will use. 8196/64 = 128.06. So ~129 instances is needed. Yes it makes ~380 per hour. There will be other costs included, e.g. dynamodb, network traffic, elastic volumes, ...

@Jacobstoon @KomodoPlatform How many nodes were on the testing chain? If not enough nodes then it’s a test for AWS not any #blockchain.

[slack] <CrypToon> Anyone have some input to this Q?

[14-Jun-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Each chains uses 1 vCPU

[14-Jun-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing at all

[14-Jun-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
1 CPU per chain

[14-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can connect as many "nodes" to it as your like if you have the money/resources to deploy them all.

[14-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Jun-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the bandwidth used for any single blockchain is as a normal blockchain is

[14-Jun-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
2mb per minute.

[14-Jun-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
per chain.

[slack] <CrypToon> Ok ill answer in a bit if someone doesnt beat me to it need to run som errands first

[14-Jun-18 09:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
New trigger is working great.. there is still some variation between the two tests due to block time variations... but we can just increase the amount of blocks in the first test by some more.. the Stats website can tell the difference between  1 payment and 100 payment blocks anyway so it shouldn't really matter if we get a little bit of crossover. 

if it proves to be an issue once I can test with the stats site, I can adjust the gaps between the tests. Main thing is I managed to get single payment to run for 15 minutes with full blocks for 20 blocks, using just a singel CPU per chain. 😄

[14-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Hey, not really sure what you mean by this question and why it is relevant, there was one vCPU per chain. You can connect as many nodes to is as you like if you have the money/resources to deploy them all. The bandwidth is approx 2mb per minute per chain, so it’s not really an issue.

[14-Jun-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Something like this?

[14-Jun-18 12:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
payments per tx calc could be better, just based on a couple of reference values at the moment. It can detect where all tx in block are 100 or all tx in block are 20, but mixed payment/tx blocks are less relaiable.

[14-Jun-18 12:30 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if some chains are on 20 and others are on 100, it's all good

[14-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <blackjok3r> but the chains them selves may overlap .. so 1 chain has 1 payments and another has 100.

hey @patchkez would i be able to use a python threadpool to issue curl requests to load test my amz rest api pretty easily? e.g. https://www.codementor.io/lance/simple-parallelism-in-python-du107klle
i used to do this in java, but don't know python - but it looks simple enough to hack at

[15-Jun-18 04:09 AM] Mylo#8306
inside the containers - does docker grab threads as it needs?

[15-Jun-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> @mylo5ha5:matrix.org: did not try any python multithreaded app in container, but I assune it will work. containers are just isolated processes. did you try docker images + docker-compose I prepared for you?

[15-Jun-18 08:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can spawn multiple process inside a container no problem. I did it for the TxBlaster, it uses komodod + blocknotify and and pre-compiled marketmaker.

[16-Jun-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> any explorers for the asset chains at the moment? want to review a few reference blocks to confirm logic for blocksize  => payment per tx detction.

[16-Jun-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> @Mylo(KomodoPioneers) in the json / csv, is the `mempooltx` value equivalent to sum of payment counts within `totaltx` value? if so I'll use that rather than calc on my end.

[16-Jun-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```block=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT)
    mempool=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getmempoolinfo)
    blockinfo=$(echo $block | jq '{size, height, time}')
    totaltx=$(echo $block | jq '.tx | length')
    mempooltx=$(echo $mempool | jq -r .size)
    mempoolMB=$(( $(echo $mempool | jq -r .bytes) / 1000000 ))
    RESULT=$(echo $blockinfo | jq --argjson mempooltx $mempooltx --argjson mempoolMB $mempoolMB --argjson totaltx $totaltx --arg chain $chain '. += {"totaltx":$totaltx, "ac":$chain, "mempooltx":$mempooltx, "mempoolMB":$mempoolMB}')```

[16-Jun-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats the JSON being pushed to the DB.

[16-Jun-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you need anything else please let me know and I can calculate it on this end, as this node has very low load as it is, and there is one for every chain, it will keep everything nice and distributed.

[16-Jun-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you want to totally ignore mempool info, as I only put that in there for my own debuging of TxBlaster.

[16-Jun-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And  unless you put something to show mempool size on stats website, that info is redundant and I will remove it for real test.

[16-Jun-18 07:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah looks like mempool stuff not needed on my end. can calc payment per tx from block size, or simply from `totaltx`.

[16-Jun-18 07:02 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
8859 means singles

[16-Jun-18 07:03 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
557 means hundreds

[16-Jun-18 07:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a little fuzzy inbetween, but when we're at capacity it is pretty straight forward

[16-Jun-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> bytes per tx, calculate this and it will be easy to differentiate. dont just use total tx per block

[16-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> size of block divided by numtx

[16-Jun-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
THe is no possible way that a single chain can mix blocks of 1 payment and 100 payment.

[16-Jun-18 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but there could be some chains on 1 and some one 100, but it is not much crossover.

[16-Jun-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> yes but it is possible to not have a full block

[16-Jun-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> so if no crossover, my method works regardless of how many tx in a block

{Reactions}
👌 

[16-Jun-18 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes towards the end of the single payment there will be blocks that are not full. 100 payment, I am yet to see a block that is not full.

[16-Jun-18 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But calculating it per byte or pre TX is the way to go.

[16-Jun-18 07:14 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
all good then. should have the csv parsed and aggregated soon. looking at the data there are some good indicators.

[16-Jun-18 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sweet, so all we need now is a way for the DB to push the required data to you. The last test I ran with 64 chains I lef the AWS on stopped, so its no issue to load it up and run another test any time. No need to rebuild docker image. I do have discord on my phone, so I can be pinged here, if you guys need me.

to all the holders of kmd, every 100-300kmd held is 1 year of notarisation for a dApp in the future.  these aren't just opportunities to profit in the case of kmd price rising, but an opportunity to learn how to apply the knowledge of the ecosystem in future dealings with your own partners in projects - and the team is here to help with the learning as we build resources for this technology to be available to anyone.
