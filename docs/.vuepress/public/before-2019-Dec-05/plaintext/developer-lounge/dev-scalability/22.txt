I will keep my word üòÇ livestream the tx test would probably gain a lot of interest or attention. Can already see there being heaps of qs and trolls in the comment, so probably best if a few admins/discorders are on at the same time to correct the false info üòÇ

Anyone decent with docker able to help me with something? I created this repo that creates 64 separate containers running komodod. Problem is that each container's volume is ~900mb. Need to figure out how to trim that down if possible

dockersegid - The purpose of this is to semi-automate the process of staking coins on all 64 segids on a komodod ac_staked chain. This process is neccesary to secure a newly created ac_staked chain.

[30-Jun-18 07:58 AM] patchkez#5349
@Alright I am not sure if multiple komodod instances can share one komodod data directory. You can try to symlink ~/.komodo/blocks directory, but I have no idea if the data will be consistent

[30-Jun-18 08:01 AM] patchkez#5349
other option would be to use ZFS or BTRFS filesystems with enabled deduplication for .komodo directories

[30-Jun-18 08:05 AM] Alright#0419
Thanks, Emman just pointed out that it's making a copy of the zcash params for each container >.<

[30-Jun-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
that should cut down the size significantly

[30-Jun-18 08:16 AM] patchkez#5349
@Alright are we talking here  about docker image size or data volume mounted to each container on startup?

[30-Jun-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
They're persistent volumes. The size of each on disk

[30-Jun-18 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
What are you making (testing) , @Alright ?

[30-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
KMD POS asset chains have 64 separate segids which each compete separately

[30-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Alright#0419
that repo allows someone to stake on all 64 segids easily

For marketing purpose we should do the same, an event, with a fixed date, to attract attention, otherwise we will maybe reach 1M tx/s but no one will bat an eye because none will know about it.

Mylo said he thought maybe an optimized test with 1024 chains had hit 45K tps? Is that right or has that not happened yet?

[06-Jul-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you want to use verified data use the first test with 1024/chains. There were some errors with the data in the last few tests. Next week we will be testing the new stuff and once it has been verified from 2 sources and the expected result we will post here.

[06-Jul-18 09:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yep, 1024 chain has better numbers

[06-Jul-18 09:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
64 chain is about 9k tx/s, 55-60k pt/s

[06-Jul-18 09:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020

[06-Jul-18 09:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
http://cryptocartography.io/txscl_vis/ data on the 24 was from a live data run, and I am confident of the results though they have not been validated against source data (between the green background bands on the graph). 
Live tests on 25/26th went wrong somehow, vis was under-reporting, but Web's data for the 26th is 100% confirmed valid.

[06-Jul-18 09:07 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
data on vis without green bg band is random generated, with parameters to simulate live 64 chains, and purged periodically

Those were hard.... super hard and very very expensive but we learnt a huge amount in the process and embarked on building this new version. Its been a slog, lots of road blocks, feeling much more relaxed after some time away and really looking forward to getting this thing done in the coming weeks. I wont be spending 15h a day on it this time though üòÜ

[06-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Daniel CP#2020
One last question. If someone asks how they can independently verify the results of the scaling tests, is there a way for them to do that? Or is there some place I can direct them if someone wants to see more details about the tests?

[06-Jul-18 11:58 AM] Andros _s#8801
:Komodo:

[06-Jul-18 12:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181 (pinned)
Yes, the blockchains will be available on an AWS storage for anyone who has the ability to actually process that much data.

We figured out from the first test, that capturing it in real time was going to be very hard, and devised a system to do it, it wasn't easy, but this appears to be the best way to measure whats happening as is happens. You can use the script that Dwy made to get about 1024 chains at once, and then merge the SQL DB's together etc, but it becomes quite tedious and difficult. specifically since we are running everything in containers now. However the blockchain data and the JSON generated on each block, containing its timestamp, size and number of transactions, are all saved in the cloud for anyone to check.

Our most important priority this week, will be to make sure the live data is 99% accurate and documenting how it works etc. I think being transparent about how we did it, and showing the results should be enough for most people. I understand  that people will be sceptical with such a vast number of TX/s, and the estimated size of the blockchains for the test is 6.4TB! üòÆ

[06-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'm sure it's tough to keep track of all the data for such massive tests. It's just hard for us from a marketing stand point. These tests are epic and groundbreaking but it's so easy for other projects to dismiss us or basically say we're making shit up. It's easy for them to do for 2 reasons: first, because there are lots of crypto projects that are, in fact, completely full of shit, and second, because even if they know we're telling the truth they have incentive to publicly deny our results for the sake of promoting their own projects as "the best" or "the most scalable" or whatever

[06-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Daniel CP#2020
So that's a really long way of saying, yeah, the more data and verification we can provide people, the better
