However if you just want data to say a blockchain can run at full block capacity, you could just point to BTC at the end of last year...  every block was full for months straight.

[17-Jul-18 08:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont see a need to prove what has already been proven.

[17-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Mylo#8306
OK fair point.

[17-Jul-18 08:30 AM] Mylo#8306
What has been the largest scale test tx/s to date?

[17-Jul-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The 1024 chain test.

[17-Jul-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but they were 100 pyamnt TX's so the 20,000 number is far lower than theortically possible.

[17-Jul-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The 256 chain test, to test kubernetes should eclipse that number easily... theoretical maximum is ~37k tx/s.

[17-Jul-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If we need higher than that we can use 512 chains to double it.

[17-Jul-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Either size will give us the data we need.

[17-Jul-18 08:50 AM] Mylo#8306
It's pretty much processing bytes of tx data across a decentralized chain cluster.  Correct?

100 chains ~= 200MB/min
1000 chains = ~=2000MB/min
10000 chains = ~=20000MB/min

[17-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Mylo#8306
I want to build a template/HOWTO so others can take our work and implement their own test.

[17-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Mylo#8306
Possible now?  Or some doc gaps to fill ?

[17-Jul-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for a single payment TX.... which is 1 vin to 2 vouts (your payment and the change returned to the first address) you can fit 8859 TX's into a 2MB block.
For a 100 payment TX, (1 vin to 101 vouts) you can fit 557 TX into a block. Anything inbwteeen should follow a fixed ratio, you can check this by creating some TX's and seeing how big the raw hex generated is. 
Each chain can process on average 2MB per minute,

[17-Jul-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The transaction size also would work the other way, ie, combining 100 vins to 1 vout, to "join" the UTXO's back together.

[17-Jul-18 09:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With this data you can do math to work out how many chains is required to achieve any required amount and size of transactions.

[17-Jul-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My repo's would need some updating and some more docs for others to start at square 1, with no chains, and generate the JSON with the chain cluster parameters. But its not really that hard, with some updates to my scipts and docs, you can generate any number of chains in a cluster and all required scripts automatically to launch a notary node network to notarize them to KMD.

[17-Jul-18 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It took me about 2H from zero notary network to a network of 4, and min sigs for a notarization of 2.

[17-Jul-18 09:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In real world, I think min sigs would need to be more than 2 and notary nodes would need to be more than 4, however the compute resource required for these is pretty small. Biggest requirement is RAM and network bandwidth.

[17-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Mylo#8306
This is great, thanks heaps üôè 
So, with your engineers hat on - in case it wasn't üòõ , a "real world" use case would have multiple vin:vout combos and there'd be many more addresses.

[17-Jul-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.

[17-Jul-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which is why I think we should describe it as maximum payments, however even then, the size of the transactions  will still vary and the amount of payments in a block will also vary. It totally depends on use case. Designing your cluster to run at capacity is also not clever, likey you would use 50-100% more chains than you 'need'.

[17-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Mylo#8306
Pretty much bytes processing throughput, with a handful of variables that us clever humans use to measure these concepts as payments and transactions.
Noted re: deployment rationale.

No worries, we are waiting on  kubernetes stuff... AWS decided to make it harder than the google version to use for some reason.

I have my suspicions that connection issues are due to amplified "metadata" retention, and the tech is actually an ASIO spook, but as long as the c*nt sorts out my connection I'll scrub down the filth afterwards

[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> first you have to get a complaint number from provider :)

[18-Jul-18 02:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
past that. got my paperwork in order. Dont tend to make threats without being ready to execute them. If ASIO tech fixes it, no need to esculate, but sad thing is they dont do much without the threat.

[18-Jul-18 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <mylo5ha5:matrix.org> ASIS are who you wanna watch out for - make sure your tech doesn't have the secret handshake :P

[19-Jul-18 07:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
... they must know I'm on to them... tech didnt show up. I noticed they reported 'no fault', and blamed internal wiring, but never showed up to confirm by actually testing the internal wiring.

so, whats the status to run before end of month?

[19-Jul-18 10:32 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
doable. I'll be heading up to Jurien 30th July, back 2nd Sept, but as long as mobile doesnt crap out, can use laptop. Looks like I wont have nbn back up for another week though

[20-Jul-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@patchkez  When you have some free time, whats the status on the kubernetes stuff? I noticed yesterday there are 3 small 8 core instances left running on the KomodoPlatform account, doesn't seem like they cost a huge amount, just wondering if you got them working or just forgot to shut them down. 
My Internet changes over (to FTTN) on the 27th of July, so I would say if we dont get the next stage up and running by then, it would be best to leave the 256 chain test until next month when @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 2 is back from holidays and hopefully both our Internet connections are up and running. This also leaves plenty of time for marketing to work out their end. 
Of course we need to test a small 24 chain test on kubernetes first to make sure your YAML etc is correct and everything is working with my recent changes. I have ported the dockerfile and all scripts so its the same for all chains, and everything is set in the docker-compose.yml so set-up should be trivial in that regard.

@blackjok3r  I killed those instances yesterday, I do not need them now. I am still trying to fix problem with kubectl not able communicate to Kubernetes cluster. I tried to recreate cluster several times, modified kube config but still when communicating with cluster, it is asking for username and password. Just FYI I followed this guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html. Heptio authenticator is configured correctly, it can use AWS credentials. I will open support case today and ask for help.

sharding ^ no mention of security

[25-Jul-18 03:59 AM] digital bullion#8223
That is an interesting read. That definition of sharding sounds like taking the long route to the destination (the destination being scalability)

Waiting.  Combo of things to wait on.  Internet upgrades (we have some shitty internet here in AU), holidays, AWS support ticket re: kubernetes.

We are able to use google cloud but because of all the waiting involved, at least waiting for next week when internet upgrades should have been completed and hopefully AWS has looked at the support request.

I will contact @patchkez  and find out the status of the AWS once he is available. I really hope we can get a 24 chain test launched on kubernetes before the end of this week, which gives me next week to get everyhting ready for the 1 million TX test while smk is on holdiays.

Hi guys

[26-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Hermes#6934
Question from a Telegram User:

45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.

However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?

[26-Jul-18 11:14 PM] Mylo#8306
45k tx/s but if you waiting for a confirmation, then yes 2,700,000 tx/min (with testing due soon to 60,000,000 tx/min 1st confirmation) & per contract if required when it get released, because contracts run in their own blockchain and implement cross-blockchain interoperability as per the crypto-conditions standard published by the IETF (internet engineering task force), that manage internet standards like IP addresses, DNS, email protocols etc.

[29-Jul-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ok... We finally found the problem with skipped blocks in the website live display today.  Using AWS has is drawbacks, but the advantage of not needing a webserver that can handle 8000+ connections per minute outweights them, once we figured out what was happening that is. 
Also what branch of komodo should I be using now, it was on `momo` but I changed it to `dev` when CC were merged in. Is this still the one I need to use? @jl777c

[29-Jul-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810

[29-Jul-18 11:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just waiting on AWS support to help @patchkez  with kubernetes deployment, also looking at out account limits, there is no way we can launch 8192vcpu's at this stage, so someone needs to talk to them about that.

[29-Jul-18 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am very close to launching a fully notarized test though. Could do mayb 256 chains, with first 64 notarized in a couple of weeks. Depends on what marketing wants, I would rather use that test to run kubernetes and kill two birds with one stone, after we confirm its working with a very small cluster.

[29-Jul-18 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changed everything to `ac_cc=1001` and pushed to repos.

[29-Jul-18 11:59 AM] Mylo#8306
if you run 64 chains and all 64 are notarized, that's about 6k tx/s isn't it?  i can use that info for dApp develop HOWTO documentation.  64 chains notarized @ 100KMD per year is 6k KMD.  @300KMD it's 19k KMD.

[29-Jul-18 11:59 AM] Mylo#8306
6k tx of the 1 payment per tx

[29-Jul-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
