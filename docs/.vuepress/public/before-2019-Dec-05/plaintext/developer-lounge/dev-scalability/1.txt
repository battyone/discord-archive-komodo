Thanks for your response! The matrix bridge has been approved

Can anyone please validate (or fix) the accuracy of this statement? - "Komodo is testing the limits of payment processing per second, and has already achieved rates faster than Visa and Mastercard. This is achieved through "Grandmother of Merkle" notarisation via linked assetchains, with atomic swap capability allowing parallel chains to act as a single cryptocurrency."

[27-May-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I don't think atomic swaps have anything to do with this system.

[27-May-18 04:51 AM] emmanux#0000
more related to crypto-conditions, i think

[27-May-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes, crypto conditions and MoMoM .

[27-May-18 04:51 AM] smk762#0000
yeah, thought so. sounds cool but üòõ

[27-May-18 04:53 AM] smk762#0000
anyone got linkage to a good explanation of crypto-conditions?

[27-May-18 04:54 AM] emmanux#0000
there will be a "burning protocol" that will allow crosschain transactions.

[27-May-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04

[27-May-18 04:55 AM] smk762#0000
burn protocol also sounds cool

[27-May-18 04:56 AM] smk762#0000
Better? 
"Komodo is testing the limits of payment processing per second, and has already achieved rates faster than Visa and Mastercard.
This is achieved through "Grandmother of Merkle" notarisation via linked assetchains, with crypto-conditions (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04) instituting a burn protocol, allowing parallel chains to act as a single cryptocurrency."

[27-May-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Sounds pretty good to my understanding of it. üôÇ

[27-May-18 04:59 AM] smk762#0000
Awse. Finally cleaned up my vis code on git and added a readme - https://github.com/smk762/txscl_vis/

[27-May-18 04:59 AM] smk762#0000
Still on random, will begin linking to the AWS data @Mylo is working on.

[27-May-18 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Yeah if you want any specific data to be pushed to the DB let me or @Mylo know. I have all the new blaster code running from `-blocknotify` so I can run any cli call you want directly after a block is mined.

[27-May-18 05:04 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I was thinking to just calculate the number of payments (and grab number of TX) in each block and push that plus assetchain name and timestamp to the DB. Otherwise the DB may need to do all the calculations from the RAW blocks and end up becoming a bottleneck.

[27-May-18 05:06 AM] smk762#0000
I had a list somewhere. What you just mentioned is enough for the majors. Beyond that, it's just a "last 5 min" sum or average of those values which I can do on my side.

[27-May-18 05:06 AM] smk762#0000
How are you calculating payments?

[27-May-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am not yet lol. Need to test the fastest way to get the TX. I think something like what james proposed is the best way.

[27-May-18 09:33 AM] smk762#0000
If you include blocksize in the stats emitted I have a basic method. Will need more data from different payment per tx test runs to refine it more but it's good with 20s and 100s from the lst test we ran

[27-May-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think we dont really need to measure anything between 1 and 100. I can test a few diffrent ones though. I need the docker files, as the scripts will change a little bit when its all put into containers. After that then we cna start chains and test different things very easily. Once we have 2 docker images that work perfectly for a single chain, its just a matter of starting X of them.

[27-May-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The blaster nodes dont use very much resource as it is, so stats gathering there is the best solution.

[27-May-18 09:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Should have these ready tomorrow. I think any calculations should be made on the blaster nodes, just to distribute load for endless scale.

[27-May-18 10:29 AM] smk762#0000
sounds good. If broadcast from blaster nodes does it need to be calculated or is it already available as a blast variable?

[27-May-18 10:29 AM] smk762#0000
Guess it's just a matter of finding the most efficient payments per tx value then?

[27-May-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
There is an output from blaster at the end of each loop that gives a TX/s value that it sent to the mempool. The blasters run a fair bit faster than the miners can clear them, so there is a condition after each blast loop that checks if the mempool is under 5mb before running the next loop. I dont have an optimal setup for this yet either, but as long as the mempool is always full thats all that matters really. It took quite a while before it got to a 5MB mempool using 1payment TX/s.

[27-May-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Larger TX (100p) will fill the mempool a lot faster, than small ones (1p). But a single blast node is able to saturate a mempool of a single chain without issues for any TX size. The hardest thing will be starting all the chains at the same time. I might be able to change the block height condition to check for a timestamp instead. That might not be as fool proof though. I dont think it will matter too much if if it slowly ramps up to the maximum, it can pretty much run indefinatly as long as we have disk space for the chains to fit into.

[27-May-18 12:44 PM] imylomylo#0000
this is why it's good to get a cloud provider onboard for testing.  aws, redhat, canonical, ibm, azure any of them - they'll have the bandwidth and processing power to provide explorer-like services in the future and for individual businesses - to have an explorer-like api to talk to other chains to verify blockhash - save doing it manually - have oracles, like with MoMoM data... shrug...

[29-May-18 12:58 AM] imylomylo#0000
resync with `txindex=1` takes a while!  blackjok3r that paris test box is at 18% from 10 hours ago - if you can let it do it's thing that would be ace so i can get txdata out of it later in the week for aws explorer.

[29-May-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
No worries, havent even touched it since putting LTC/DASH on there mate.

[29-May-18 02:05 PM] libscott#0000
Hi all

[29-May-18 02:05 PM] libscott#0000
is anyone running chains with the momo branch?

[29-May-18 02:06 PM] jl777#0000
all the TXSCL chains use -ac_cc=1

[29-May-18 02:08 PM] libscott#0000
I see

[29-May-18 02:08 PM] libscott#0000
are they running momo branch

[29-May-18 02:08 PM] jl777#0000
no, just normal

[29-May-18 02:09 PM] jl777#0000
but do all nodes need to run the momo branch? maybe for now test in a non-forking way?

[29-May-18 02:09 PM] libscott#0000
the burn tx will work but import tx wont

[29-May-18 02:10 PM] libscott#0000
also import tx will only work if ac_cc >= 2, the way I made it

[29-May-18 02:10 PM] libscott#0000
ie 1 is not a valid fungibility group

[29-May-18 02:12 PM] shossain#0000
i've kept them running as -ac_cc=3

[29-May-18 02:12 PM] jl777#0000
the ac_cc val cant change without changing the chain, so they started at ac_cc=3?

[29-May-18 02:12 PM] jl777#0000
if so it is ready to test

[29-May-18 02:15 PM] blackjok3r#0000
No. I created 4 new chains running the momo branch for @SHossain

[29-May-18 02:16 PM] jl777#0000
ok, as long as we are on the same page

[29-May-18 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I think we can just use the seed node for any test you need. 4 chains is enough? 
I have not genereated new chains for now test yet, we are working with just 2 local chains until we have the 2 docker images working. I started on the TxBlaster image today but got caught up. Will finish it tomorrow unless I run into any problems.

[29-May-18 02:19 PM] libscott#0000
Awesome üëç

[29-May-18 02:20 PM] libscott#0000
Do all chains have different symbols?

[29-May-18 02:20 PM] libscott#0000
How can i see how to sync with them?

[29-May-18 02:20 PM] shossain#0000
TXSCL, TXSCL000, TXSCL001, TXSCL002

[29-May-18 02:20 PM] libscott#0000
Nice

[29-May-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#0000
as long as you use the seed ip @SHossain has you will sync with those chains.

[29-May-18 02:21 PM] blackjok3r#0000
every other parameter is the same as the old ones.

blackjok3r you may want to update the komodod for the `momo` branch in your seed node. there were some updates.

[29-May-18 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#0000
