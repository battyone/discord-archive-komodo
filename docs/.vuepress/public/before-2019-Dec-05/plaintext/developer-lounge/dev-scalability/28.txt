ok, cool, thanks. I will do some cleanup and push changes to our repo

[25-Aug-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Great work! I will get the rest of the stuff done next week, shouldn't be a lot, me and @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator can run some small tests during the week if he is available.

The script is fine, as the generated yaml may change, I think I will change the private keys I am using just before the test just in case some one wants to play games with the test.

Iran Finalizes National Cryptocurrency Draft Document, Regulations...
Iran has reportedly finalized a draft document on the matter of cryptocurrency in the country. This move comes as the government plans to create a state-issue virtual currency to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

is there a way to check how long a particular transaction has been in mempool?  or it's age from initial sending to being confirmed?

[29-Aug-18 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I am pretty sure thats possible will post how in a while

[29-Aug-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r hey mate! I am thinking to use 1 server from hetzner for eth notarisation testing

[29-Aug-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what's the situation with them?

[29-Aug-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was going to start with those today once I finish what I am on.

[29-Aug-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I can use only 2 of them

[29-Aug-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and an AWS instance for the other 2.

[29-Aug-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have plenty of funds now.

[29-Aug-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can take the 88 IP one and i will use the other 2 if thats ok with you? @grewalsatinder

[29-Aug-18 06:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
perfect! thanks a lot mate üôÇ

[29-Aug-18 06:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I can wipe and reinstall OS on 88 IP ?

[29-Aug-18 06:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all backedup and fine ?

[29-Aug-18 06:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, james said the explorers were no longer needed

[29-Aug-18 06:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool! I guess this same server will again will be available as soon as our eth testing is done and we finally move our eth notarisation to existing nodes

yep hopefully the scale test stuff is done before that üòÑ

[29-Aug-18 06:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless I have problems today and tomorrow its finished and ready to go as far as i am aware.

[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] snowdamn#2414
are you aiming for a specific date for the next scaling test?

[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats up to marketing

[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I still have a few things to tie up, just have not had time yet

[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
thank you üëç

[29-Aug-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there will be another 64 chain test with full notarizations and everything very soon, and then a 512 chain test ASAP. Then marketking can schedule the 1 million attempt.

tbh most of this project was tieing together a heap of others peoples work,a nd leverging AWS infrustructure which appears to scale litterally to infinity.

[30-Aug-18 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... Things are underway here üòÑ Setting up notaries etc now. I put 2 in Hetzner Germany, 1 in Singapore and one in Us West coast. 
Explorers are hosted in South America. This should be enough for anyone who complains that the nodes are not far enough apart from each other.

[30-Aug-18 08:47 AM] PHBA2061#2530
guys, talking about scalability, do you think that on-chain scaling by increasing blocksize (basically what Bitcoin Cash does) will be limited by storage & bandwidth thus making it centralized ?

[30-Aug-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not really, a VPS that can run pretty large blocks (or in this case lots of chains) is quite cheap. If you need a full node, you use a server.

[30-Aug-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CHMEX What is the fastest way to deploy some exporers for AC? I need to load up 64 of them on AWS , I made a single instance for all of them, because thats the easiest way to get all chains loaded in one place

[30-Aug-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Then I need to map the ports to some kind of DNS.

And add your coins in the config file

[30-Aug-18 09:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
The dns i dont know depends on your hoster I guess
@grewalsatinder did in the beginning 128 explorers I believe script might be on his meshbit github

[30-Aug-18 09:03 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@webworker01  yeah I know, I'm talking about crypto coins that dynamically increases their block size over time

[30-Aug-18 09:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes I did use his stuff the first time to deploy a heap, but I think there was more progress made on that to make it easier since then. I will start with this and then see how we go, I think having a nice URL will be needed.

[30-Aug-18 09:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
first tings first I need to launch 64 chains up and get everything connected I guess. lucky we have lots of AWS credits now üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Mylo#8306
ah so @blackjok3r probably hafta start hooking the game up to some blasters in next cpl weeks.  i'm flying to uk on monday, so will be out of action for 24-30 hrs or so.

[30-Aug-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... ran into some unexpected problems here.... I forgot james made us change the ac_cc= to 1001 ... I didnt realise this would change AC ports, and just did search replace on the repo... turns out that didnt work... Had to change some `C` code and regen all chains with `ac_cc=1001`

[30-Aug-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
now all the docker-compose files are wrong, and it would take 100 years to edit it manually...

[30-Aug-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lucky patchkez has scripts for it, but I am not having any luck getting them to work at the moment. Hopefully wont take all night. Not sleeping until this is working üòÑ

[30-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Regnar#6164
Hey quick question about the scaling test, do we know where the testing results/data will be stored yet (or how big this will be, I'm thinking in the multiple TB size?) and will we be able to get it in CSV format so people can verify/graph/work with the data in things like R or anything?

[30-Aug-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its raw blockchains

[30-Aug-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5-10Tb

[30-Aug-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is also the JSON format of the summery of each block, that we use for the stats website.

[30-Aug-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that could be exprted to CSV for each chain without issue.

[30-Aug-18 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but a spreadsheet with that much data would be insane to work with

[30-Aug-18 02:57 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I figured it'd be a lot, but I'm looking at coinmetrics csv data as well and it'd be cool (for marketing and proof purposes) to be able to offer a single (though massive) CSV file for download if someone wanted it haha

[30-Aug-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can easily add another line to push the JSON as CSV format instead to the text file.

[30-Aug-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then afterwards we can script this to merge them all together

[30-Aug-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but tbh, all you need is 1 chain.. its easy to see that all chains are the same.

[30-Aug-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
take a few random samples from each chain

@Alright  Would I be able to get some help testing the cross chain stuff for this. I almost have a 64 chain cluster with explorers and notaries up. Hopefully this does not burn though too many AWS credits.

[30-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Alright#0419
yea what's up

[30-Aug-18 05:39 PM] Alright#0419
do you have notaries up?
