I am thinking the game should be what does the CC transactions 😃

[27-Sep-18 11:14 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Of course I will contribute funds too if needed

[27-Sep-18 02:49 PM] tolken#2655
Didn’t Mylo or someone have a game that would send tx’s a while back?

[27-Sep-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes he made one and it works already. we just need to link the server that receives the "comands to send transactions" to something that sends transactions.

[27-Sep-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that will be trivial. I had to fix MoMoM first. 5% of the time there is a mismatch of MoMoM hash on target chain, and the sent coins from the target are lost. Finding this error was not easy, and it likley could have been missed by most people. But because I activly tried to break it like I usually do i was able to track it down, and tabulate the data so it cna be fixed. Just got it done tonight, and its mostly automated so we can collect as much data as we need. Took a few weeks this one. Lost a LOT of sleep over it.

For anyone who is interested.

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We are not lazing about

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so you know the reason it was failing?

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Exactly the problem yes

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the problem?

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that spreadsheet shoudl allow libscott to fix it

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the MoMoM data on the target chain, is diffrent the the MoMoM data KMD has

[27-Sep-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some kind of notarizaion issue.

[27-Sep-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but not a missed notaization

[27-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, sounds like a timing mismatch

[27-Sep-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-Sep-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
rare one at that too

[27-Sep-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
does not happen often

[27-Sep-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that data needs to be cross checked to a dump of all back notarizations on the target chain to see where the problem lies.

[27-Sep-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
gathering it was tricky to say the least

[27-Sep-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we eagarly await libscotts return.

[27-Sep-18 05:15 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Hello everyone, I have a few questions regarding the Merkle Trees in Komodo. Trying to understand everything in the whitepaper is quite daunting and I would like to be as accurate as possible for the infographic I'm working on. Anyways here goes. 
```
Question 1

From the website

"Komodo’s notary nodes create a new Merkle Tree out of all the Merkle Roots that have been generated since the previous notarization. This happens for each assetchain in the Komodo ecosystem utilising the Federated Multi-Chain Syncing feature.”


Question: Is the main KMD chain considered an assetchain in this case, thus creating and including its own MoM with the rest of the Assetchain MoMs? (as part of the syncing and MoMoM creation)
```

[27-Sep-18 05:15 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```
IF THE ANSWER IS NO (I'm beginning to think the answer will be no)


Question 2-A


From the website

"Once all the MoMs have been synced with the KMD chain, they are organized into yet another Merkle Tree."


If the KMD chain is not considered an assetchain and does not create its own MoM as part of the syncing process, is it safe to say that ultimately, the MoMoM is the Merkel Root of the KMD block itself, every 10 minutes

```

[27-Sep-18 05:16 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```IF THE ANSWER IS YES


Question 2-B


From the website

"Next, Komodo’s notary nodes take the MoM from each assetchain and sync them all with the KMD chain."


If the KMD chain does create its own MoM, does it do so before or after the assetchain MoMs sync to the KMD chain?


Clarification 1: If KMD creates its MoM before the sync, does this mean it stores its own save-state into itself?

Clarification 2: if KMD creates its MoM after the sync, does this mean this particular MoM includes all all the other assetchain MoMs within it?

```

[27-Sep-18 05:17 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```Question 3


From the website

"The fourth and final step in Komodo’s scaling solution process is to notarize the MoMoM back onto every assetchain in the ecosystem."


Is the MoMoM sent to the very next block of every assetchain right after the last snapshot?



Question 4


From the website

"Every ten minutes, a snapshot is taken of the entire Komodo ecosystem. Then, this snapshot is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain."


Is it safe to say that this snapshot is the MoMoM?



Question 5


From the website

"Re-Notarize Back Onto The Komodo Blockchain – After the backup has been created on the secondary blockchain, the location of the backup is then written back into Komodo’s main blockchain."


Is the "location of the backup" sent to the very next block in the KMD chain right after the last snapshot (the block with the MoMoM)?

```

```
   @MoldyLunchbox thanks for your interest.  I think here is an answer to Q3,4,5.

This 👆 output is from an assetchain that notarizes to KMD.
NN's do this:
AC -> KMD 
KMD -> AC
Whether it is the "very next block" or not,  doesn't sound likely because it's not something that can be guaranteed.  From the output of `getinfo` you can see there is the last notarization and last MoM info in there.

From the notarized block, to the current block is the "lag" or _number of blocks since notarization_

KMD notarizes to BTC.  That's where the checkpoint/save-state is.  I don't think KMD does a MoM of itself, it has the BTC notarization and lag of it's own.    (Someone will correct me if i'm wrong soon no doubt) 😃

hi

[30-Sep-18 07:14 AM] june#7792
is there any admins here?

[01-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Mylo#8306
sometimes.

[01-Oct-18 03:28 PM] Mylo#8306
hey @patchkez & @blackjok3r & @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  need to rotate all the security keys in AWS before i resubmit some info so we have keys rotated as part of the security policy.

Can you rotate your keys at the earliest convenience for your own user and the kubernetes user @patchkez as well.

[01-Oct-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the API keys ?

[01-Oct-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
~/.aws/credentials stuff ?

[01-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Mylo#8306
yes please

[01-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Mylo#8306
you've got to login to the web console and make your current ones inactive, generate new ones.

[01-Oct-18 03:30 PM] Mylo#8306
AWS likes them <90 days old, so by the time they review the submission again, at least we'll have fresh ones 😛

[01-Oct-18 03:31 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm still working out this audit trail stuff.  on the home stretch!!

[01-Oct-18 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it really didnt look fun man, thank you very much for helping

[01-Oct-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We have a good idea on how to get MoMoM working, good news is with out changing any code, and making keeping blocktimes steady and as optimal as pssoible its less than a 2% fail rate. By slowing down just a little bit it should be perfect, just awating libscott to return.

@blackjok3r i noticed you liked moving onto more break-fixing stuff instead of audit logs.  i will remember :trollface:

[01-Oct-18 03:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha breaking and fixing stuff is more important than that corperate stuff 😛

is it correct that a single blockchain can do ~100 tx/s ? And batching up to 100 payments per tx?

[04-Oct-18 05:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
931.66 payments per second per assetchain at 100 payments a TX

[04-Oct-18 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
147.65 payments per second single payment TX

[04-Oct-18 05:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
thanks, I needed this answer!

[07-Oct-18 04:40 AM] IP#9768
guys, sorry for stupid question, but am i right that komodo basically has the same block time/block size as zcash (so same throughput) but because komodo has a multichain system, it can scale lineraly with the number of chains?

[07-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
almost

[07-Oct-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
1 minute vs 2.5 minutes for ZEC, so actually 2.5x per chain

[10-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Hermes#6934
Biggest scalability test was 2018-05-16 14:59  - - - - -    1307631    - - - - -21793 ?

[10-Oct-18 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We really really need libscott to return so I can fix MoMoM and get back onto this project, I ws hoping to get it done this week while Alright was away 😦

[10-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
instead spending my days building a decentralised TROLL box

[10-Oct-18 02:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Although I could use that type of chain to carry out the scale test and increase TX/s by like 1000x per chain 😂

[10-Oct-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but that would be cheating

[10-Oct-18 06:51 PM] come#8331
🤔

[10-Oct-18 10:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I might do a tx/s test on troll for a few minutes just too see what kind of speeds it can handle later today just too see. Its not really any meaningful teat but will be fun.

[12-Oct-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
waiting on @libscott  to come back from holidays... the scaletest is essentially finished. We are just waiting to the AWS partnership to be finished and some bugs to be fixed in the MoMoM, as in testing we found somethimes coins can be lost, and we cannot run the scaletest with a limitation like that.

Is @libscott identity known? At least to the team. So someone can check if everything is fine

[17-Oct-18 01:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he spoke to me a few days back, and wanted access to my testing VM, I gave it to him, ut then he disapeared again.

same reason I didn't want to promote this at just the standard tier, it's not as important as they'd like you to think

[23-Oct-18 05:38 PM] Steve Lee#1967
technically they're not allowed to announce anything, but it seems they know local chinese AWS reps who are giving them quote
