You can try it, but I doubt it will work, the miner need to push exactly 1.3s per second to be able to make 60s blocks and the market maker and komodod needs 2/3 of a pretty decent core to generate the txs. As it was I needed to put in the mining pause to fill the mempool for single payment tx, if your not going for full blocks, then it will work fine, you can start a shit load of containers on a very small system, until the chains are of decent length they don't even need much ram.

[31-Jul-18 04:33 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks, i'll see if i can do anything before commenting on what would be good üòÉ  not worried about full mempool to start off with, just going to see if a bare-metal option is available

Sweet, not sure what the status is on AWS. But if there is anything you need to test or work on your end hit me up. Happy to spend some time on it whenever.

@blackjok3r  Hi man, sorry I was out,  still have some health problems. AWS support came to us and provided some ideas how to fix the problem I was facing. Unfortunately I could not make it working. Partial problem was old kubectl binary I was using. But I still cannot authenticate with new kubectl  against K8N cluster. I assume IAM roles are set correctly, but cluster does not let me in.

[02-Aug-18 10:21 AM] patchkez#5349
@blackjok3r do you want to try your luck and try it out? I re-created this cluster ~6 times.

[02-Aug-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure I can have a go at it.

[02-Aug-18 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mainly just need your script to parse into the YAML and then I can make one with a few chains and try to start them...

[02-Aug-18 10:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Trial and error is my speciality...  Given enough time I can usually make it work üòÇ

you can try to follow this guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html just skip creation of IAM role and VPCs, these are done

I will have a go at this tomorrow, have my kids tonight. There is still plenty of money on the account as far as I am aware so hopefully I can get it to work in a few days time.

[02-Aug-18 10:27 AM] patchkez#5349
you can try to create your won cluster  in N. Virginia or Oregon. In N. Virginia, only these 2 subnets (2 regions only) can be used for creating cluster subnet-07a313961d6219c7e, subnet-0f627de46941059c0.

[02-Aug-18 10:28 AM] patchkez#5349
I tried to create clusters with 3 nodes only and smalles possible instances

[02-Aug-18 10:29 AM] patchkez#5349
but this is not needed yet, once you create cluster (without worker nodes) you should be able authenticate against it with kubectl which is not the case for me

[02-Aug-18 10:29 AM] patchkez#5349
or if you want we can try to collaborate together on configuring this, I went through part of the hell already

[02-Aug-18 10:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We had some issue with DynamoDB locking us out one time aswell... It only happened the one time, like it was a bug or something. Sure. I will have a play with it. So the only issue is that you create the cluster, but cannot "talk" to it?

[02-Aug-18 10:31 AM] patchkez#5349
right

[02-Aug-18 10:31 AM] patchkez#5349
cluster can be running without worker nodes, these are added at later stage

[02-Aug-18 10:31 AM] patchkez#5349
you must have correct kubectl and heptio authenticator versions

[02-Aug-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the kids go to sleep within the next 2-2.5H i will start this tonight. really keen to get a move on with this. Getting the dynamoDB to play ball with 8192 chains was difficult, but we got it working. Simulated data only but should not make any diffrence.

[02-Aug-18 10:33 AM] patchkez#5349
I will try to recreate the cluster again today, but I am out of ideas. Also after following that documentation, have a look on last opened support ticket, support guys is explaining some things there

[02-Aug-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool will do. Hope we can sort it.

[02-Aug-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As far as the live stats site goes, its all working with 64 chains and simulated 8192 chains, so we should be good to go.

[02-Aug-18 10:34 AM] patchkez#5349
cool

[02-Aug-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its just launching 8192 chains and firing off the trigger.

[02-Aug-18 10:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still amazed the API endpoint that receives all the JSON from all chains, is on free teir, and never charged us any money üòÆ

[02-Aug-18 10:35 AM] patchkez#5349
well 8192 chains = 16258 containers üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its a lot of containers... I think also we still need to figure out how to save the shared data folder to S3 data store, I think thats the one we need to use.

[02-Aug-18 10:37 AM] patchkez#5349
feel free DM me if you have any questions, I am almost 99% sure I have configured it correctly üòÉ

[02-Aug-18 10:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No worries.

[02-Aug-18 10:38 AM] patchkez#5349
yeah, I saw somewhere EKS documentation how to attach S3 volume to worker nodes

[02-Aug-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes currently, there are 2 stores but they both save to the same place. one container saves a backup of all the JSON that AWS returns, so we can see if anything was missed/errored out (so far, seen 0 fails which is crazy with that much data) and the other one saves blockchains to the same local folder. Hopefully its just changing the folder from local to remote in the YAML.

[02-Aug-18 10:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just kicked off aggr script, still on v7 table. Lemme know if need to change anything on my end

[02-Aug-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that should be fine, not sure how long it will be until i can get anything working got kids here and they are being very silly. They need to go to sleep, hopefully wont be too long lol

was pretty sweet, stayed at an old pastoral lease on a few thousand hectares, and both nights were dry enough to sit around the firepit. howling storm on the way back though and I had to crawl for a stretch looking for a servo when the fuel light came up. Limped along on fumes from around Lancelin to Yanchep

Not sure what your issue was @patchkez  exactly... but I followed the guide forAWS from the start on a clean system and it appears to work, going to try and launch some worker nodes

[03-Aug-18 04:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am up to the "Launch guestbook application" I guess this is not what I want to actually do... but maybe I can look at the sample YAML files and copy a 2 chains cluster into it instead... Dont know if this is going to work though, seriously have no idea what I am doing... But on a clean system, I deleted everything you had made, and followed step by step the documentation and it works fine so far. No errors.

@patchkez

[03-Aug-18 08:10 AM] patchkez#5349
@blackjok3r  nice!  so you can do kubectl get svc and it will return IP of cluster?

[03-Aug-18 08:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... I launched the Guestbook... hte only issue I have is that the guestbook test app, never gave me a URL so i cant see that its actually working.

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I dont think thats important at all...

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Next thing is to actually launch some containters in it

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] patchkez#5349
we do not need that testbook, it is just example

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I just did it anyway

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Didnt take as long as I expected lol

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] patchkez#5349
I got email from AWS today, they charged us 100$ for support üò¶

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
They do that anyway

[03-Aug-18 08:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Steve had to pay for business support to get the anvanced teir

[03-Aug-18 08:12 AM] patchkez#5349
how many worker nodes you started?

[03-Aug-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I did 1 minimum and 3 max of small mediium size...

[03-Aug-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thats like 6 vCPU's

[03-Aug-18 08:13 AM] patchkez#5349
ok

[03-Aug-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume we need to start the whole thing again... or we can just change this clusters size?

[03-Aug-18 08:13 AM] patchkez#5349
I think we would need to recreate it

[03-Aug-18 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The tested model is 64 chains in a 64vCPU instance... but those havs 256GB of ram, wich is overkill/

[03-Aug-18 08:14 AM] patchkez#5349
subnet size is not big enough to address 16K containers

[03-Aug-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh ok... I dont think we can launc that many containers in the one region either way

[03-Aug-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We may even need to launch some clusters in another account, @grewalsatinder  got an AWS account we may have to use.

[03-Aug-18 08:15 AM] patchkez#5349
then we  need to just delete that cloudformation stack and create new one, or we can keep adding new stacks with different instance types

[03-Aug-18 08:17 AM] patchkez#5349
can you share with me kubectl config file + credentials you used in aws config  into DM? will try to communicate with cluster from here

[03-Aug-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can just delete that one, and make a new one. We need to make a cluster of like 10 ro 20 chains, so its nice and cheap, and get a YAML made up and make sure its all working

[03-Aug-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sure

[03-Aug-18 08:18 AM] patchkez#5349
in my previous tests I used k8n_admin for authentication with cluster

[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I deleted everything and made it all new with my API keys.

[03-Aug-18 08:47 AM] patchkez#5349

[03-Aug-18 08:48 AM] patchkez#5349
bloody heptio authenticator! It seems I had wrong version installed

[03-Aug-18 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Glad this is sorted out. We are getting close now... seems market is near the bottom.. Maybe we can time this with a nice price rise üôè

[03-Aug-18 09:08 AM] patchkez#5349
@blackjok3r  I am trying few things on the cluster now. I hope I won't break it üòÉ Created new IAM role with mine and your user ARN and will try to apply it to the cluster. So we have dedicated role which has  rights to manage EKS cluster. Then each user can use his IAM credentials to manage cluster and we do not share 1 credential between all admins. I think this is also requirement from AWS.

[03-Aug-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That was a requirement yes

[03-Aug-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont worry if it breaks... it was easy enough to do, we can jsut start again..

[03-Aug-18 09:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not like al lthose cloud formations I made for the Dynamo DB lol.... they cant be removed

[03-Aug-18 09:10 AM] patchkez#5349
yeah, I was doing it so many time, I know whole procedure almost by heart üòÉ it was good that you tried it and we identified the problem (my problem:-( ).

[03-Aug-18 09:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha no worries... I expected it to be a lot longer and harder than it was.

[03-Aug-18 09:10 AM] patchkez#5349
cloudformations stack cannot be removed? why?

[03-Aug-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just says delete failed

[03-Aug-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and you can do anything with it

[03-Aug-18 09:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no matter none of those cost any money unless you use them, and they have no endpoint to connect to

[03-Aug-18 09:12 AM] patchkez#5349
most probably because of this:      The bucket you tried to delete is not empty (Service: Amazon S3; Status Code: 409; Error Code: BucketNotEmpty; Request ID: BD1D2A6EEDB85495; S3 Extended Request ID: ap5O9Hv9rKWm51wZaXZMSoCYYalyZtd4doXbuo39kMynM/KQHO+ks/uagOyBhjfxAKQwTCDBa1M=)

[03-Aug-18 09:12 AM] patchkez#5349
try to delete s3 buckets first

[03-Aug-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Version-7 is perfect iteration, that works 100% of the time for us now.

[03-Aug-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the rest can be deleted..

[03-Aug-18 09:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Aug-18 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Good luck with containers.. Once you have format put the template or whatever into git and let me know, and I can make sure it all fits with my docker-compose.yml for the first 64 chains. There were many changes over time.
