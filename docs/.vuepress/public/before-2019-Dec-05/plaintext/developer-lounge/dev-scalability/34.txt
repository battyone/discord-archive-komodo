how does KMD sync all of the txs going on in many side chains and form them into merkle roots? seems like there would be a bottleneck there no?

[24-Nov-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarisations

[24-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its taking only the merkleroot of each block

[24-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it doenst need all the txs

[24-Nov-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it places the merkroots inside a tx on the otehr chain

[24-Nov-18 06:14 AM] nuttycoin#5982
what is "it" ?

[24-Nov-18 06:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the import logic

[24-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it only needs a merkle root that validtes the transaction

[24-Nov-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry if i make no sense im really busy right now

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] nuttycoin#5982
hm yea not sure if i understand it correctly, no worries though

[24-Nov-18 06:30 AM] nuttycoin#5982
do you know of any documentation that would explain how the protocol works? afaik it's not explained in the whitepaper

@Steve Lee  @Mylo  
What is the status with AWS, I have found a use for the service in the short term. We can use an AWS end point, to do one of the steps for migrate transactions. Currently for testing all our test nodes require, the source chain, target chain and hte whole KMD chain synced. We can make the KMD part a centralised service, accessed via an AWS API... This will make it also much much easier for me to carry out a mass scale migrate test without requireing crazy crazy amounts of hardware and $$$.

[29-Nov-18 05:42 PM] Mylo#8306

@blackjok3r  finally got a meeting yesterday with them. they've been quiet for the past few weeks due to the Reinvent conference where they launched QLDB and their managed service offerings.

[06-Dec-18 11:29 PM] Steve Lee#1967
I'm setting up a meeting with their blockchain segment to discuss the joint testing and other GTM strategy

[06-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Steve Lee#1967
can we explore  if we can integrate AWS autoscaling with AC deployment?

[06-Dec-18 11:31 PM] Steve Lee#1967
so a solution where if TX hit a certain threshold an additional asset chain is deployed. James indicated this should be technically possible. would be something of interest to AWS, and the two people I spoke to about it were really interested in exploring that solution.

[06-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Steve Lee#1967
tying it into the overall scaling solution test would also be a neat showcase if possible

[07-Dec-18 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That isn't technically impossible... A lot of the things we have been working on with #kmdlabs  will enable just this type of thing.

[07-Dec-18 01:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can  say that once I have finished getting that launched and bug free we can make a PoC using AWS hosting.

[07-Dec-18 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Which should be a matter of weeks away. The full MoMoM tech was upstreamed to KMD yesterday, and while it will need to be tested there to make sure everythign required was merged up is right and all of it is there, seems like we can use AWS to both test this and an autoscaleing solution at once.

etc. etc.

[30-Dec-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The entire process is pretty safe and fine, butthe export tx is made incorrectly allowing you to import more coins than you burn. The coins are sent to the miner on the target chain.

[30-Dec-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those are cool though !

[30-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had to just trial and error this crap until i understood what it was doing.

[30-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To solve this, its easy enough to require the tx to be funded before creating it... but anyone canjust change that... it needs to be consensus absed.

[30-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We need an extra check of txs that are burnt in the Transacion validation code I think.

[30-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is tricky.... I was meant to be doing something else today lol... now I wont be able to tstop thinking about this. üòÑ

[30-Dec-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... well I force the tx though on another node and all is well

[30-Dec-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It breaks consensus rules... so currenlty some one can burn coins but not retreive them, and as doing so makes no sense, all it should need is a sanity chekc when creating the burn.

[30-Dec-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No one in their right mind will go in there and change th code to destroy coins üòÑ

[30-Dec-18 04:03 AM] Mylo#8306

[30-Dec-18 04:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181

Things seem to just take far longer than they were supposed to... The MoMoM fixes took 8 months to iron out... We are in planning stages of a migrate stress test in #kmdlabs  There will be bounties up for the person who can do the most migrates ... IMO this test is more important than the tx spam test of the scaletest, although we definatly shoudl still run that, as its been ready to go for a very long time.

[06-Jan-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
