nice work @blackjok3r who ended up doing whatever url rewriting?  or some other way was conceived?

[09-Jan-19 08:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
webworker did it...

and gave me pointer on how to fix html display issues... was then just a matter of trial and erroring diffrent things until all links went somewhere or didnt show.

hi, what consensus mechanism do side chains in KMD use? is it the same dPoW that the KMD main chain uses?

[19-Jan-19 12:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes apart from Verus which got its own VerusHash algo. I believe you can already set your aglo for new chains now equihash or verushash where default is equihash

Hmm looks like he left already

[19-Jan-19 02:16 AM] nuttycoin#5982

[19-Jan-19 02:39 AM] nuttycoin#5982
i'm also curious how side chains can trustlessly validate the generation of coins that have been burned on another chain. do nodes in side chains have to be constantly processing the merkle roots in the main KMD chain?

[19-Jan-19 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
but yes, all based on merkle roots, allows chains to verify transactions happened on other chains

[19-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
only the merkle roots involved in a specific crosschain tx needs to be validated

[19-Jan-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is really a very efficient process to "bind" all the chains in a cluster

[20-Jan-19 03:54 AM] nuttycoin#5982
@jl777c that makes sense, but how does the validation take place on the tx receiving side? how do i know that the KMD node i am connected to isn't giving me a fake merkle root?

[20-Jan-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
because you are getting MoMoM as part of the notarizations

[20-Jan-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so the raw tx -> txid -> validated in merkleroot -> validated in MoM -> validated in MoMoM

[20-Jan-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
like a recursive SPV validation

[20-Jan-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand how SPV validation works before you can understand MoMoM

[20-Jan-19 07:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
my understanding is that SPV is not totally trustless, as its security requires the light node to rely on the full nodes that it connects to. correct or no?

[20-Jan-19 07:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
```While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.```

[20-Jan-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, in this case the notaries are the nodes that need to be trusted to be making valid MoMoM

[20-Jan-19 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no overpowering of the notaries

[20-Jan-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is like making SPV secure and then iterating on it

[20-Jan-19 07:38 AM] nuttycoin#5982
ok gotcha. so the assumption is that every notary is honest.

[20-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[20-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the assumption is that the majority of notaries are not dishonest

[20-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
all the notaries must come to consensus on every notarization. a minority dishonest wont get any notarizations

[20-Jan-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so to get any fake MoMoM the majority of notaries need to be dishonest and collude with each other

[20-Jan-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a fatal flaw in the game theory for these evil notaries.

[20-Jan-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
who holds the privkey to whatever SPV games they will do? all the evil notaries would need to trust their leader to share the wealth and as any collusion is immediately apparent on the blockchain, this is a onetime thing for any of the colluders, who are then identified as the culprits. and only the evil leader gets any money from it. this is assuming there is success in their shenanigans, which there isnt any guarantee

[20-Jan-19 08:05 AM] nuttycoin#5982
i'd say bribe-based attacks are slightly more dangerous though. because the theoretical profit-maximizing equation for a notary would be 
`act malicious if (bribe_reward > (annual_kmd_reward - annual_resource_costs)  * (1 + ‚àë[i=1,‚àû] ip(1‚àíp) ^ (i‚àí1)))` , 
where p = probability of earning a top 30 spot

[20-Jan-19 08:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
whereas some PoS-based threat models require some kind of slashing, in which dishonest nodes not only miss out on potential revenue but also lose assets instantly

[20-Jan-19 08:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
(that notation is kinda unclear also, sorry about that lol)

[20-Jan-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
except the notaries would be specifically identified

[20-Jan-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
factor in the risk costs, changes the equation

[20-Jan-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so not only would any top 30 spot is forfeit, there would be prosecution risks

[20-Jan-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
another factor is that a false MoMoM attack is order of magnitude(s) more difficult to conduct than a 51% attack. but at scale this factor becomes small

[20-Jan-19 08:38 AM] nuttycoin#5982
true, illegality is a significant cost as well albeit hard to estimate

[20-Jan-19 08:39 AM] nuttycoin#5982

Hey people show is everyone doing?

[27-May-19 12:12 AM] Ian#3705
@jl777c  - So Sharding vs manychains  - scrambling/unscrambling vs crosschain merkleroot magic - unless your transactions have high chain affinity, how are you better off ? What makes extreme chain affinity any different to payment relationships vis-√†-vis payment channels  - is it just a matter of granularity of sharding. The more parallel chains you use the more you will have to maintain locally, and if your affinity does not match the chains native affinity you will be little better off than with a single chain and a larger block size. Sharding requires coordination protocols for cross-shard transactions, you use merkleroot magic

How are they fundamentally different ?

[27-May-19 12:17 AM] Ian#3705
(The comment re "you will be little better off than with a single chain" only applies when you have transaction counts that compare with how many shards/chains you interact with - obviously 1 trade a week is going to be much tighter)

The main point is whether your proposal is just a specific sharding implementation where you have more control over chain affinity ?

[27-May-19 12:26 AM] Ian#3705
And how does it compare with Cosmos, Polkadot, Kadena, Harmony, ...

[27-May-19 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
in the extreme cases, I am sure you can specify a scenario where sharding vs many chains devolve to being approx the same.
however, let us deal with reality
a single cryptokitties dapp basically saturated the ETH chain. this cannot be denied. Let us now assume there is a second dapp cryptodoggies from a different vendor. I claim that the overlap between cryptokitties and cryptodoggies will be VERY small. How likely is it that they have to share state? they are different dapps from different vendors.

Now, what if there are hundreds of dapps from hundreds of vendors. just how much overlap is there between all these dapps?
doing payments is about the only thing where it is shared globally for all things and your logic could apply, even then it is very likely to be ways to automatically have locality of payments.

However, anybody can see without any formal maths that forcing all cryptokitties, cryptodoggies, cryptobirdies,... into a single chain and then sharding it cannot be anywhere as efficient as simply having independent chains for each one.

The big difference of komodo versus all the other many chains solutions is that komodo doesnt require vendor lockin. maximum independence and each chain is literally its own independent chain that has the option to add dPoW, but not the obligation. there is no per tx fee to pay to a master chain, no deposit needed to be able to make a chain, etc. i argue that the komodo approach is the most decentralized. What happens in all the other systems if the mainchain goes down?

[27-May-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
also, this is not just theoretical: https://www.dexstats.info/explorers.php

[27-May-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
54 independent chains, the total capacity is well in excess of 10,000 tx/sec. and there is not much crosstalk between chains, in fact, atomic swaps can be done for the times where that is needed.

[27-May-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
now imagine a single chain that is the combination of all 54 chains. If any chain comes close to saturating the single chain, 53 other chains suffer. Not to mention that the txfee for everyone goes up. Sharding is basically that. combine all things into a single chain, then somehow split it apart and make it all work. I have no idea how they will achieve this, seems very difficult problem to me.

[27-May-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe with a magical sharding solution you can have a single virtual chain that is composed of many shards, but what have you achieved? A way for all to pay higher txfees

[27-May-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
sharding is an attempt to extend the mainchain taxation onto all transactions. komodo is a tax free zone and we dont do contortions to be able to enforce a tax on all usage in the ecosystem

[27-May-19 01:37 AM] Ian#3705
What you are describing is affinity - and it exists in general computing as well - a typical CPU has L1, L2, L3 cache and maintaining the majority of access to a single cache segment within a layer is the answer to orders of magnitude in performance. By implementing multiple chains you have manually specified domains where affinity is strong. This is good, where you can manage it. It works really well when you have a defined community of interaction and hence well defined strong domains but is not so easy with a general payment system such as Bitcoin where the domains are not so easy to define.

[27-May-19 01:53 AM] Ian#3705
Perhaps it is because my understanding of the term sharding pre-dates blockchain tech and i assume that the algorithm for splitting shards is configurable.  

An example - BarterDEX . Having it's own chain separate from others will segregate DEX traffic from other chain traffic in the Komodo ecosystem. How might you speed that up beyond what is feasible on Layer 1 using more frequent and larger blocks.  You could implement Layer 2 but defining useful networks of payment channels is non-trivial. You could shard by pair, but again the spread of activity is usually not evenly spread as trading on BTC/USD and a few major crosses probably swamp all the rest combined. If you define any manual sharding criteria (or multichains) what happens when that changes?

[27-May-19 01:56 AM] Ian#3705
Perhaps the system could look for strongly correlated activity, assign groupings and attempt to minimise cross group activity - it could then shard the traffic according to that grouping, gaining the advantages of affinity whilst not needing to define that grouping in advance

[27-May-19 02:00 AM] Ian#3705
Over time the pattern of activity could change - the grouping of activity perhaps changeing with it, and the layout of the shards with it as well. The consensus mechanism could exchange that sharding criteria  so each node could work out which shard it should use at any given time

[27-May-19 05:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BarterDEX doesn't have any blockchain.
It is only a p2p network.
