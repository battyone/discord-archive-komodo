ok, that would explain stuck nodes

[29-May-18 09:36 PM] jl777#0000
and stuck nodes wont notarize very well

i dont see anything that would affect stuck blocks, but best to rebase anyway

i moved all the MoM related RPC calls to rpccrosschain.cpp

@SHossain: what printouts happen during/end of notarization?

[29-May-18 09:44 PM] jl777#0000
good idea to have rpccrosschain.cpp

how about if i use minsigs.1

[29-May-18 09:52 PM] libscott#0000
:shrug: dont see why not?

[29-May-18 09:57 PM] libscott#0000
is there any way I can work around needing to have notary vins in CreateNewBlock?

[29-May-18 09:57 PM] libscott#0000
tests are broked ðŸ˜ž

[29-May-18 09:58 PM] libscott#0000
in test mode I dont have any other way to get inputs other than mining blocks so it appears to be a chicken and egg problem

[29-May-18 09:58 PM] shossain#0000
what went wrong?

[29-May-18 09:59 PM] libscott#0000
more recent version of the code automatically generates a notary transaction, though im not exactly sure what it's doing. but it requires that the wallet be populated with vins

[29-May-18 09:59 PM] libscott#0000
which in my test case it isnt

[29-May-18 09:59 PM] jl777#0000
yes, populate them with 0.0001 vins

[29-May-18 09:59 PM] jl777#0000
or dont notary mine

[29-May-18 09:59 PM] shossain#0000
i'm not mining

[29-May-18 10:00 PM] jl777#0000
pwallet being null seems to be if you disabled wallet

[29-May-18 10:00 PM] shossain#0000
this is my KMD start script
```
cd komodo
./src/komodod -notary -pubkey="0239b39630f71b5ef4e145ab9bd9daaf0871fa59904cf9c216619609d2d6ed5ee0" &
```

[29-May-18 10:01 PM] jl777#0000
for notary that is the way

[29-May-18 10:02 PM] libscott#0000
the thing is, in my test cases I'm creating a blockchain and generating blocks on the fly. And I'm spending the block rewards

[29-May-18 10:02 PM] libscott#0000
In order to be able to get block rewards to spend I had to do the following:

[29-May-18 10:03 PM] jl777#0000
if you arent notary mining it shouldnt require notaryvin

[29-May-18 10:03 PM] libscott#0000
Ok so I need to stop using NOTARY_PUBKEY

[29-May-18 10:04 PM] libscott#0000
and use the wallet for block rewards

[29-May-18 10:04 PM] jl777#0000
yes

[29-May-18 10:04 PM] jl777#0000
with pubkey it believes it is a notary and will try to notary mine

[29-May-18 10:13 PM] libscott#0000
I merged dev into momo and pushed, will fix tests meanwhile

[29-May-18 10:13 PM] libscott#0000
so momo is up to date with dev now

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] shossain#0000
so, will i get new source for momo testing?

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] libscott#0000
yes

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] shossain#0000
cool

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] libscott#0000
shouldnt be neccesary to resync I suppose

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] jl777#0000
the current mystery is why there is no notarization

[29-May-18 10:14 PM] jl777#0000
no need for resync

more notarization happening

[30-May-18 10:20 AM] jl777#0000
plz see how many different chains you can notarize before iguana cant handle anymore

[30-May-18 10:22 AM] shossain#0000
we have only 4 chains running with `-ac_cc=3`

[30-May-18 10:22 AM] shossain#0000
but, now i was using only TXSCL chain

[30-May-18 10:23 AM] shossain#0000
will activate all of them

[30-May-18 10:23 AM] jl777#0000
it needs to be TXSCL chains

[30-May-18 10:24 AM] jl777#0000
what does TXSCL stand for anyway?

[30-May-18 10:24 AM] shossain#0000
transaction scale

[30-May-18 10:24 AM] shossain#0000
or scaling

[30-May-18 10:25 AM] shossain#0000
started with 4 chains

[30-May-18 10:27 AM] shossain#0000
if you want more chains notarized, either blackjok3r has to change all chains to `-ac_cc=3` or i have to use the default `-ac_cc=1` and i will also have to rent better server than my current 2nd server.

[30-May-18 10:33 AM] shossain#0000
TXSCL000 has notarization

[30-May-18 10:40 AM] shossain#0000
TXSCL0001 has notartization

[30-May-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have 2 servers we can use, with the chains at 0 blocks you can run an immense amount of them on a single server, once they get large then RAM and TPC ports becomes a huge issue.

[30-May-18 10:44 AM] shossain#0000
i have tx machine on for all the chains at 5 min interval

[30-May-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
They are actually satinders, but I have access, and they are not doing much right now.

[30-May-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Thee chains dont need TX, they have a block reward and will keep mining every minute.

[30-May-18 10:46 AM] shossain#0000
i see. i will stop it then

[30-May-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I managed to add 1024 coins to iguana, but did not call dPoW on them.

[30-May-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
With anything oer about 128, I think TCP TIME_WAITS will be an issue. I have done some research on that, so that iguana can keep a persistent TCP connection on the RPC port, then we cna probably scale to much higher chain numbers.

[30-May-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It seems this -rpckeepalive was put back into zcash some versions ago.

[30-May-18 10:48 AM] shossain#0000
can we get all of them using `-ac_cc=3`? @libscott needs that.

[30-May-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Yeah I can start say 256 of them the same as the first 4 ?

[30-May-18 10:48 AM] jl777#0000
