blackjok3r can you please confirm that we have same blocks?
```
$ ./assets-cli getinfo | grep "blocks"
TXSCL -   "blocks": 5409,
TXSCL000 -  "blocks": 11088,
```

[31-May-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
sure, give me few mins

[31-May-18 10:48 AM] shossain#0000

[31-May-18 10:50 AM] shossain#0000
looks like we are on the main chain.

[31-May-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yep, there is 2 nodes running the first 64. half mining on each one. They seem working fine from my end.

[31-May-18 10:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
sweet thanks 😄

[31-May-18 10:53 AM] shossain#0000
cool. thanks for confirming

[31-May-18 10:53 AM] shossain#0000
i had only one notarization after starting.

[31-May-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Worked perfectly, starting it up again now.

[31-May-18 11:05 AM] smk762#0000
any chance you can change the json for total tx from string to int serverside?

[31-May-18 11:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think so. So its working then?

[31-May-18 11:07 AM] smk762#0000
I saw a block event value, so copied it to get the formatting, though the value has not changed in a while or had other events added for a while

[31-May-18 11:07 AM] smk762#0000
got this though for the graph - https://www.highcharts.com/errors/14

[31-May-18 11:08 AM] smk762#0000
could type convert on client end, but would prefer not to

[31-May-18 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Its written in BASH so normally the variables are untyped. But maybe I can just do `let $totaltx = $totaltx`

[31-May-18 11:09 AM] smk762#0000
are there quotes around the totaltx value on generation?

[31-May-18 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah thats the sample @Mylo put up. I just changed the JSON format to what he wanted.

[31-May-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ahhh... yeah I can easily remove the quotes I think. give me a few mins to try it.

[31-May-18 11:10 AM] smk762#0000
sweet, cheers

[31-May-18 11:21 AM] shossain#0000
for some reason, no new notarizations yet. will start iguana again

[31-May-18 11:21 AM] shossain#0000
another happened 🙂

[31-May-18 11:32 AM] imylomylo#0000
If not I can change in rest function

[31-May-18 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I got it

[31-May-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The -args option webworker gave was string only changed to --argsjson

[31-May-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
now its just 5

[31-May-18 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Are we ready to test it again?

[31-May-18 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Interesting that it misses block 3. 🤔 Thats when marketmaker starts and importpriv key happen. Guess its not important as its an empty block.

[31-May-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and block 8, which is when blaster is tiriggered.

[31-May-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
might need to put a sleep of 10s after these coneditions

[31-May-18 11:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
is this `blocknotify` not being triggered?

[31-May-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its triggered

[31-May-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but the stats dont happen

```

[31-May-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I mean its designed so the stats can go somewhere else, I can just change the miner node to `STATS = 1`

[31-May-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
might avoid it

[31-May-18 11:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but they are both empty blocks so it doesn't really matter

[31-May-18 11:50 AM] imylomylo#0000
`BLOCKNOTIFYURL` definition seems accurate :trollface:

[31-May-18 11:51 AM] imylomylo#0000
😛

[31-May-18 11:52 AM] imylomylo#0000
blackjok3r ☝ (in case you are reading through script and didn't see last message)

[31-May-18 11:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I'm not sure what you mean lol

[31-May-18 11:53 AM] imylomylo#0000
you haven't sent `BLOCKNOTIFYURL`

d'oh

[31-May-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
does it work? are you receiving data

[31-May-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
?

[31-May-18 11:55 AM] imylomylo#0000
not receiving

[31-May-18 11:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
hmmm ok

[31-May-18 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Need to debug it then.

[31-May-18 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the `$BLOCKNOTIFYURL` outputs `"https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify"` from inside the container

[31-May-18 12:07 PM] imylomylo#0000
is curl installed?

[31-May-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#0000
thats running the script from my home pc

```SyntaxError: Unexpected token \```

[31-May-18 12:10 PM] imylomylo#0000
got an extra `\` in there somewhere

[31-May-18 12:11 PM] imylomylo#0000
what is in `echo $JSON >> ~/stats/stats.txt`?

[31-May-18 12:11 PM] imylomylo#0000
should just be json object, e.g. ```{ "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }```

[31-May-18 12:12 PM] imylomylo#0000
not ```"{ "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" }"```

[31-May-18 12:22 PM] imylomylo#0000
k, redeploying with extra logging so i can see what is received.

[31-May-18 12:22 PM] imylomylo#0000
can you re-run easily?

[31-May-18 12:22 PM] imylomylo#0000
redeployed.

[31-May-18 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#0000
simple 😄

[31-May-18 12:24 PM] imylomylo#0000
do it again, redeployed - need more data 🙂

[31-May-18 12:24 PM] imylomylo#0000
received 'null'

[31-May-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#0000
its sending nothing?

[31-May-18 12:26 PM] imylomylo#0000
yeah it seems

[31-May-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#0000
🤔

[31-May-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ok I will add another print in my script and run it again locally.

[31-May-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#0000
strange

[31-May-18 12:28 PM] imylomylo#0000
can you send it to a different server easily?

[31-May-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah it takes liek 5mins to change anything a rebuild image

[31-May-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#0000
unless you rebuild komodod

[31-May-18 12:30 PM] imylomylo#0000
send it again...

[31-May-18 12:30 PM] imylomylo#0000
as is

[31-May-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#0000
thats from my local pc using a test block

[31-May-18 12:33 PM] imylomylo#0000

[31-May-18 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe it doesn't need the '\' added?

[31-May-18 12:36 PM] imylomylo#0000
weird, maybe not.

[31-May-18 12:36 PM] blackjok3r#0000
one sec I will try without it

[31-May-18 12:42 PM] smk762#0000
how many records will it keep up in history

[31-May-18 12:43 PM] smk762#0000
is there a pagination limit?
