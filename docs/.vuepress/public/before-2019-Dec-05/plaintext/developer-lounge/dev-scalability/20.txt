where is smk's code, might not be hard to lambda-ize it

[26-Jun-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I want to use this site and the system here to make a TX/s site for entire KMD ecosystem, all it takes is to run the blocknotify on my seed node and push stats to dynamoDB, wouldn't cost much at all, maybe $5 a month.

[26-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Mylo#8306
found some of it in a recent tab https://github.com/smk762/txscl_vis/blob/master/js/update_metrics.js

[26-Jun-18 03:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah sould be there, not sure if he pushed recent changes... we changed LOTS of it last night, most of the bars and things were flat out wrong on the first try, TX/s were right though

[26-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Mylo#8306
cool - yeah lmk if you do pursue that idea.  blocknotify is pretty useful.  i was in verus discord preaching about telecommunications network event based systems for better comms, it got ack'd but not the path for their autochains they are going.

[26-Jun-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I will set it up for sure, after all whats the use of making a system like this to use it for a few hours... seems a bit of a waste, even if its a world record.

[26-Jun-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for the silly cheap cost to add it to all KMD AC on NN its  a no brainer to me.

[26-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Mylo#8306
when are you going on hols?

[26-Jun-18 03:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fly out friday

[26-Jun-18 03:26 AM] Mylo#8306
how long u gone for?

[26-Jun-18 03:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
6-7 days, but I will be in Perth City for a few of those, and I will have to take my laptop coz NN will need checking etc. So I wil be around.

[26-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Mylo#8306
ah only a week?  that's cool.  yeah i cart my lappy around everywhere....already did it quite a bit, but my missus only getting used the whole NN thing üòÑ

[26-Jun-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... mine is number 3 so far today...

[26-Jun-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that new ranking thing made me try more things out üòõ

[26-Jun-18 03:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wonder what happens if all the nodes start using all possible optimizations ü§î

[26-Jun-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah only a week, my mate is in Navy only has that many days off... not staying n darwin on my own, cant see that being much fun.

[26-Jun-18 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I wonder what happens if all the nodes start using all possible optimizations"
then they all work properly?

[26-Jun-18 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[26-Jun-18 03:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I mean who would be on top?

[26-Jun-18 03:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
eveeryone cant be

[26-Jun-18 03:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the guy with fiber direct to the backbone wins üòõ

[26-Jun-18 03:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems that way I guess. My DC has dual gigabit from 2 diff providers, backbone is good, but its in the middle of nowhere geographically... a lot of the top nodes are all in OVH too so they gain an advantage over everyone else.

[26-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Mylo#8306
wow you've got 13 NTZ today....

[26-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Mylo#8306

I have never seen it get a run like that

[26-Jun-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I took it down in f4a at 3am yesterday and made some changes.

[26-Jun-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once f4a finished it went crazy

[26-Jun-18 03:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but AC is still too low, at some point that BTC strak will end and I will sink back down to the middle

[26-Jun-18 03:35 AM] Mylo#8306
ah nice webworkd updated the `*` üòÑ

[26-Jun-18 03:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I asked im to put a score coloumn on site too, I need to gain 900 score to push into top 7, and kick you out üòõ

[26-Jun-18 03:37 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah i'm due for some maint on it.

[26-Jun-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not a lot you can do, wallet.dat helps, dont let it over 50mb on KMD, and a hint... autosplit of 700 KMD UTXO is too many, way to many.

[26-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Mylo#8306
are you starting m_notary_nosplit?

[26-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Mylo#8306
now

[26-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Mylo#8306
kmd has 834 utxo wight now

[26-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Mylo#8306
wallet.dat is at 51MB

[26-Jun-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no thats not it... you need to change m_notary_run to something like this: https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/SuperNET/blob/dev/iguana/m_notary_run

just casually spamming scaling channel with Notary Node talk lol

[26-Jun-18 03:41 AM] Mylo#8306
sudo nice of you

[26-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha... not sure that makes much diff tbh

[26-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it cant hurt...

[26-Jun-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You also notice my addotary are diff, that also made no diff, but the normal ones all have closed port 17775 so do nothing

[26-Jun-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I was connecting to myself there, so took that out

[26-Jun-18 03:43 AM] Mylo#8306
was your IP in the original list?

[26-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, I think 1 of 2 with open iguana port

[26-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rest are all dead

[26-Jun-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
everyone connecting to me, made fuk all diffrence.

[26-Jun-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think as long as 1 is good, you get all the IPs off that one and it connects to the network just fine.

[26-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah just seed node stuff

[26-Jun-18 03:50 AM] Mylo#8306
you've inspired me to clear out my wallet.dat!

[26-Jun-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hah I made a script that does it in one line... but didnt make it public yet becasue it invlves sending your entire balance to a newly generated address, it backs up the wallet.dat so its safe though.

[26-Jun-18 03:51 AM] Mylo#8306
ah i send to paperwallet

[26-Jun-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181

have a scirpt `sendtopaper.sh AMT`

[26-Jun-18 03:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nice, as team node, I cant send anything off node until 1st every month

[26-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Mylo#8306
is this your a-team "policy"?

[26-Jun-18 03:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[26-Jun-18 03:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the rev share is calcualted at a certain time at the first of every month in fiat value of KMD.

[26-Jun-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I like low price... means I get more of it... but also need to sell more to pay for hosting costs so its sucks in that respect.

what makes cpu go to 5-10%?  just parsing the data?

[26-Jun-18 05:42 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks and awesome work i hear üòÉ

[26-Jun-18 05:43 AM] Mylo#8306
no rush on answer, just curious - you're probably at work.

[26-Jun-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> I was running a FR node during blast a few days ago, it was mostly responsible.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[26-Jun-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> If restarting script mid blast, it spikes a bit pulling in the last 4min of data. Had some other unhandled issues with midblast restart leading to unexpected metrics, but I might have fixed that last night.

[26-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> All in all it handles 64 easy enough. Will see where the cracks appear as we scale up which should indicate peak resource reqs.

[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: I managed to fix Kubernetes configuration issue I had and now creating Cloudformation stack for worker nodes. Trying with 3 nodes cluster, each node 4vCPU. Unfortunately stack creation failed, because AWS account is blocked. Did you hear back from AWS support regarding this issue?

[26-Jun-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh wow thats blocked aswell...

[26-Jun-18 07:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no I emailed everyone I have emails for today... Been sitting around doing not much because of this... maybe we can just transfer all the credits we have to mylos account?

[26-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> yeah, because stack is creating EC2 instances

[26-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> I was googling little bit to find out if we can fix this and it seems this issue must be fixed by AWS support

[26-Jun-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I was guessing we deploy 4x64 vCPU instances in kubernetes for next test, I have pretty much prepared the YAML template.

[26-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: I would prefer to keep this Komodoplatform AWS account

[26-Jun-18 07:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Every test I have been removing some code, and unused variables

[26-Jun-18 07:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its stripped down to bear essentials now.

[26-Jun-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> AWS support just have to fix this for us. I am not sure what their response time is

[26-Jun-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> So would I, but I have 2 more days until I go traveling. I would like to have this ready and tested before that, but if not its no big deal.

[26-Jun-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: nice, better remove stuff then adding :-)

[26-Jun-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Gives time to get AWS to sort it out.

[26-Jun-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes everything now uses a single docker image... for all chains, however the first 64 are a separate YAML launched on an EC2 instance so I can connect Notary Nodes hosted in Hetzner I think they are.

[26-Jun-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> ok

[26-Jun-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> it is single docker image, but we still need to start 2 containers right?

[26-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes there is -ac and -miner in YAML but both start from same image.

[26-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: ok, that should not cause any issues

[26-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Everything is passed as ENV var, Just need to create template for your script to place all the chains in to the YAML for chains over 64.

[26-Jun-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> it works... So I imagine it should not lol.

[26-Jun-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> the next test needs to be at least 256 chains to test the stats website back end to make sure it scales linear or less than linear (?) or to see how big a server will be required for the full test.

[26-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> I think smk702 and i might need to run another 64 chain test tonight to make sure changes from last night are correct as we spent a long time squashing bugs to get everything to display correctly.

[26-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> why we do not scale also stats website?

[26-Jun-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> stats servers is puling the data from dynamodb right?

[26-Jun-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Its desgin should let it scale to very large numbers, but we just want check and make 100% sure... the last thing we want is to start 16000 containers and have it fail.

[26-Jun-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes, the dynamoDB receives the stats from each chain, they stay there for 4 minutes, every 5s the stats site scans everything in the DB from X timestamp, then filters out anything it already has and averages the TX/s over 5s.

[26-Jun-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> If I have understood correctly... smk702 will have better info than me though.
