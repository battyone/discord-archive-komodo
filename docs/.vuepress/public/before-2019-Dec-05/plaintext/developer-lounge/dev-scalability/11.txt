The CPU/RAM use of this method is really low hey, It goes in blasts, we can likley fit 2-3 chains PER CPU lol.

[01-Jun-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
üëç

[01-Jun-18 03:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
oh that's nice.

[01-Jun-18 03:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
i'll clear the DB of existing records

[01-Jun-18 03:46 AM] libscott#0000
what about memory? doesnt each instance consume 1 gig of ram?

[01-Jun-18 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
memory will be the main issue yes

[01-Jun-18 03:47 AM] libscott#0000
I wonder what's using all that ram ü§î any ideas?

[01-Jun-18 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
But starting the chains from block 0 and blasting for 1H each komodod is liek 400mb ran.

[01-Jun-18 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
once its over like 1000 blocks ram is much higher

[01-Jun-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
My best guess is some kind of index.

[01-Jun-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think assetchains use txindex=1 by default

[01-Jun-18 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe I should run some tests later with that on/off and see how much diffrence it makes.

[01-Jun-18 03:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the less resource we can use per chain, the more chains we can rnu.

[01-Jun-18 03:49 AM] libscott#0000
leveldb cache size is adjustable

[01-Jun-18 03:50 AM] libscott#0000
getting to 1000 chains will be hard tho thats for sure

[01-Jun-18 03:50 AM] blackjok3r#0000
for iguana?

[01-Jun-18 03:50 AM] libscott#0000
what about if someone wants to write their own contract code? reckon the notaries will run it?

[01-Jun-18 03:50 AM] libscott#0000
no, for a notary... the notaries are the bottleneck, right? each new chain needs to be run by all notaries

[01-Jun-18 03:50 AM] libscott#0000
(in theory)

[01-Jun-18 03:51 AM] libscott#0000
notaries*chains... it's not the same as quadratic scalability but it's similar

[01-Jun-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
bbs.

[01-Jun-18 04:02 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We can deploy more notary networks for more chains. Just scale up the iguana instances.

[01-Jun-18 04:03 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The same as you have m_notary_testnet.... you just make elected_1 elected_2 etc

[01-Jun-18 04:29 AM] maegus#0000
I kind of thought with the advent of containerizing chains within iguana would you not be able to offload chains and still keep the same pubkey?

[01-Jun-18 04:29 AM] maegus#0000
I could be completely offbase, but I kind of thought that was the whole point.

[01-Jun-18 07:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
soo very close... I think this will ahve to do. Hopefully if we run the test for 1 payment long enough we wil get a good run at maximum capacity.

[01-Jun-18 07:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
even chainging to 2 payments would make the test a lot easier. Filling mempool with 1 payment TX is not easy. I think its even less "real world" than using a heap of reasonable size multi payment TX's too.

[01-Jun-18 07:31 AM] imylomylo#0000
8k tx / minute 1 chain?

[01-Jun-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ye

[01-Jun-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes... but I dont think block times are exactly 1minute

[01-Jun-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
need to get smk762's stats up to see how its really going

[01-Jun-18 07:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I needed to upgrade to a 4 core VULTR to get this working. I put a blaster on the mining node and the stats node.

[01-Jun-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
2 core was maxed out 4 core is at 75%

[01-Jun-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It will take a bit of calibration for AWS once we get access to that to work out how many containers we can put on each vCPU.

[01-Jun-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#0000
for large payments, it actaully takes far less resources lol.

[01-Jun-18 07:34 AM] blackjok3r#0000
took me all day to make a new docker image to have 2 marketmakers to 2 komodod, and the komodod was the bottleneck. üòû

did some stuff last night before it got too late. 8196 chains, 1 min block = 136 events per sec. I"ll have to chunk and delay a bit, and figure out a better way to handle 5min averages.

no it will return all values there, what kind of way are you wanting to fetch?

[01-Jun-18 08:43 AM] imylomylo#0000
height sequentially i guess?

[01-Jun-18 08:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
aws dynamodb partitions all records horizontally for speed - so need to co-ord how to get data.

[01-Jun-18 08:44 AM] smk762#0000
tried to add ?limit=500 to url but no luck

[01-Jun-18 08:44 AM] smk762#0000
chronology I can work around

[01-Jun-18 08:45 AM] smk762#0000
can you pls link me to the api query docs?

[01-Jun-18 08:46 AM] smk762#0000
at the moment just using raw url, but if there is more query capability I have some extra options

[01-Jun-18 08:49 AM] imylomylo#0000
atm no query

[01-Jun-18 08:52 AM] smk762#0000

I'm not too familiar with nosql tbh

[01-Jun-18 08:54 AM] smk762#0000
but happy to have a look at whatever docs to get anough of an idea

[01-Jun-18 08:57 AM] smk762#0000
at the moment, values txcount read, div by 60, added to minute averaged sum, and timeout set based on createdAt +6000

[01-Jun-18 08:57 AM] smk762#0000
the 5 minute metrics are simliar with longer timnout

[01-Jun-18 08:59 AM] smk762#0000
though if it's more efficient or easier to do some of this server side, I can look to translate the client side js to whatever aws uses

[01-Jun-18 09:00 AM] smk762#0000
last round, I did the minute stuff onEvent, and the 5 minute stuff via sql query periodically

[01-Jun-18 09:02 AM] smk762#0000
pgsql failed though with too much incoming and not enough spreading of load or cores to play with

[01-Jun-18 09:11 AM] smk762#0000
could maybe drop one or two of the timestamps too if space / bandwidth and issue. updatedAt/createdAt looks like a duplicate

[01-Jun-18 09:22 AM] smk762#0000
*thinking out loud* possible to add k/v pair for timespan?

[01-Jun-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
bandwidth shouldnt be an issue for 8196 chains its like 700kb per minute lol... raw JSON data.

[01-Jun-18 09:23 AM] smk762#0000
üò£ maybe I need to think a bit longer !

[01-Jun-18 09:25 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think for now we should just get it working with 1 chain and test 1 payment and 100 payment to calibrate stuff.

[01-Jun-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
But yeah, can't the DB take the data and send a total of X chains to the stats instead of the stats site having to do all the math?

[01-Jun-18 09:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I thaught thats why we used AWS DB, for its scalability?

[01-Jun-18 09:27 AM] smk762#0000
I'm all for it, but I guess you need me to let you know what all the math is

[01-Jun-18 09:28 AM] smk762#0000
I can write a wishlist üéÅ

[01-Jun-18 09:30 AM] smk762#0000
will read up a bit on dynamodb so I can request effectively.

[01-Jun-18 09:30 AM] smk762#0000
current json is raw blocknotify?

[01-Jun-18 09:42 AM] imylomylo#0000
if dynamodb too complicated, sql backend no dramas with rest api to fetch
but if we're doing that, may as well just send txt files to servers directly üôÇ

point of having aws involved is to begin the integration process, and another scaling factor to grow along with for dApp developers to have blockchain template backend

[01-Jun-18 09:42 AM] smk762#0000
happy to learn towards the fastest way. no need to go backwards for convenience. Just trying to get my head around the schema etc

[01-Jun-18 09:43 AM] imylomylo#0000
on submission of block data, can just add it to another table with one record fetched, last block height, tx count, ts
e.g.
height 1, tx 8000, timestamp
height 2, tx 15888, ts
height 3, tx 20100, ts
height 4, tx 25999, ts

or something like that

[01-Jun-18 09:44 AM] smk762#0000
so, blocknotify populates main table, and from there slimmer aggregate tables can be produced?
