I am in touch with the Ledger devs, yes

[08-Feb-19 11:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
I haven't experienced those issues though

[08-Feb-19 11:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
what errors are you seeing?

[08-Feb-19 01:09 PM] phideas#8309
1. Every KMD tx sent out of Ledger Nano S ends up with this error "Internal process error (null)" https://imgur.com/a/8apGmxt
Actually the tx will pass through. So after you hit "Retry" another error pops up about tx already exist.

this happens if you only use Ledger Live for sending tx. if you send tx from Ledger, still it doesn't set locktime. thus, no rewards accruing possible

[08-Feb-19 01:15 PM] phideas#8309
Yes, i noticed too. Any chance Ledger Live plans to set Locktime for KMD tx?

KMD Reward Claim app was the only option that helped me to "unstuck" my funds and then move out using Ledger Live.

Magnum Wallet don't need to charge fees because they copy/paste our work without attribution. Users are free to make up their own mind which service to use, but if you want to support the original developers and sustain us to build more in the Komodo ecosystem, we can't do that without income.

@phideas I haven't encountered those errors but I'd suggest you clear Ledger Live data in settings and re-import your accounts, there's a good chance that will resolve it

done, let me know if any tweaks needed - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024442-komodo-5-active-user-reward-on-ledger-hardware-wallets

[09-Feb-19 07:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
This is incorrect:
```
While Ledger hardware wallets have supported storing Komodo for quite some time, previously it was not possible to claim the 5% Active User Reward, as it did not set a transaction LockTime which is used to calculate the rewards.
```
nLockTime is required on transactions for the outputs to accrue interest, however this wasn't the issue on the Ledger, transactions sent to the Ledger from elsewhere with nLockTime set would still accrue interest.

The issue was that actual KMD app running on the Ledger could not sign reward claim transactions because the outputs are larger than the inputs. This breaks BTC consensus rules the Ledger device would throw an error and refuse to sign.

This needed to be fixed in the KMD Ledger app (that runs on the device, not Ledger Live) before any software could get the Ledger to sign a reward claim transaction

Submitted a PR to Ledger Live to make it set nLockTime in KMD transactions by default

[23-Feb-19 11:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
This will mean you can make transactions with Ledger Live and still earn rewards on your change UTXOs

[23-Feb-19 11:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
(currently if you have a single UTXO earning rewards and then make a transactions, your change UTXO will contain your entire balance and won't have nLockime set so won't accrue rewards anymore)

There are issues with the latest version of Chrome not being able to communicate with Ledger devices over the U2F API

[27-Feb-19 07:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if you are experiencing strange errors with the KMD Ledger rewards app that is most likely the cause

[27-Feb-19 07:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
It's out of our hands, Ledger are aware of the issue and are working on a fix in a new KMD Ledger app update

[27-Feb-19 07:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
once they've released it you should be able to just update your KMD/BTC app on your Ledger with Ledger Live and then the app should work in latest Chrome again

[27-Feb-19 07:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
as a temporary work around, the app should still function perfectly in older versions of Chrome or up to date versions of Opera and Brave

So users will not lose interest in Ledger Live?

[28-Feb-19 03:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
@PTYX it's kind of complicated to explain

[28-Feb-19 03:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
Short version: Now UTXOs created by transactions originating from Ledger Live will accrue rewards

[28-Feb-19 03:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
previously they wouldn't

[28-Feb-19 03:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
Long version:

[28-Feb-19 03:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
Previously if I sent you 100 KMD fro my Agama wallet to your Ledger Live wallet, Agama will set nLockTime so the UTXOs sitting in Ledger Live will accrue rewards. You can then use our Ledger reward claim app to claim those rewards. Everything is good.

However, if I sent you that 100 KMD and you then sent 5 KMD to somebody, Ledger Live would use your 100 KMD UTXO and split it into 5 KMD to the recipient and 95 KMD back to you as change. However, it doen't set nLockTime. So now your 95 KMD balance is sitting in a change UTXO from a transaction with no nLockTime set so will no longer accrue rewards.

This PR fixes that. It makes sure all KMD transactions created by Ledger Live have nLockTime set so you can make transactions and your change UTXOs will always accrue rewards.

[28-Feb-19 03:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
It also means any recipients you pay from Ledger Live will also start earning rewards on their UTXOs
