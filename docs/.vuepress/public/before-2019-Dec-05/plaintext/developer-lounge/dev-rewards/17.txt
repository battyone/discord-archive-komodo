normally the old RPC calls are deprecated but still accessible to not break existing applications. Then are completely removed in a later version once people have time to update to avoid an infinitely increasing maintenance burden. I think that's reasonable.

[09-Nov-19 12:42 PM] farl#9964
There is a problem with the Claiming tool for KMD rewards. It did not recognize my Ledger. I tested it and it seems the problem is only with Brave browser.

have you tried to turn the shields off for the site?

[09-Nov-19 12:54 PM] farl#9964
Yes, after disabling the shields the website works with the Ledger. Normally this wasn't a problem. And you need to connect, unlock before pushing the Check Rewards button, otherwise it gives the message too. It's too fast.

@farl are you logged in you kmd app on ledger ?
Do you also have 1.3.13 Kmd App Version on Ledger ?

[09-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Acura#2748
Ah ok üëçüèª

[09-Nov-19 12:55 PM] farl#9964
Yes, logged in in KMD app

[09-Nov-19 12:55 PM] farl#9964
Yes, 1.3.13

I tried to send my KMD to myself for rewards, but the KMD never showed back up, and I'm not sure if I fucked up or what.

[09-Nov-19 04:01 PM] Oszy#5734
which wallet?

Yes, it shows a final balance of zero.

[09-Nov-19 05:36 PM] zatJUM#9924
@farl I have that too on Brave and Firefox, when I check/collect rewards, then reset, and if I want to check/collect rewards once more (for another account). If I unplug the ledger and plug in back, it works

[09-Nov-19 11:54 PM] farl#9964
@zatJUM I did not have that earlier.

In the settings of each wallet application on your Nano S or on your Blue, you can see the "Browser support" option. This setting is helpful to switch from using your Ledger device with i...

@KOSIUS which browser?

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@SHossain latest chrome

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] SHossain#0007
does your Ledger Live app detects the device?

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] KOSIUS#0001
it does

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] SHossain#0007
have you tried restarting the computer?

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] KOSIUS#0001
I did

[25-Nov-19 07:07 PM] SHossain#0007
have you tried clearing cache of your browser?

[25-Nov-19 07:08 PM] SHossain#0007
press `CTRL + SHIFT + i` and check if there is any error on console output

[25-Nov-19 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
that would help pbca26 to identify/fix

[25-Nov-19 07:09 PM] SHossain#0007
i have tried Firefox and ran into different issues. :abused:

[25-Nov-19 08:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@SHossain i think the website just is a copy of the code from my site. I think there is a issue with the insight db which is causing the issue. If pbca26 can point to a up to date insight, that should fix the issue or wait for luke to fix it

[25-Nov-19 08:26 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it is.

[25-Nov-19 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
that's at the bottom. so, Atomic Labs code was used as base and pbcca26 added Trezor support

[25-Nov-19 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
both Trezor and Ledger worked on my end

[25-Nov-19 08:33 PM] pbca26#5430
@KOSIUS how many key exports do you complete approx. until it errors?
with small amount of exports it seems to work fine on 1.6.0 fw

[25-Nov-19 08:34 PM] pbca26#5430
ledger support via web browsers is a bit clunky in my experience, unfortunately

[25-Nov-19 08:46 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@pbca26 I think like 6

[25-Nov-19 09:48 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@pbca26 checked again, its 7

[26-Nov-19 02:55 PM] 22naru#4311
so i am here with the same issue

[26-Nov-19 02:56 PM] 22naru#4311
after i upgrade to 1.6fw

[26-Nov-19 02:56 PM] 22naru#4311
magnumwallet dev confirm it aswell

[27-Nov-19 11:02 AM] 22naru#4311
any news about to fix this error?

[27-Nov-19 03:18 PM] pbca26#5430
i've asked a question on ledger github repo and on slack as well
waiting for reply

[27-Nov-19 03:37 PM] Neko#5830
keep us posted

[28-Nov-19 08:33 AM] pbca26#5430
i was able to circumvent the issue by switching to webusb
use this link if your nano s is on fw 1.6.0
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb
webusb has a different workflow, less confirmations from user but also seems more stable
doesn't to constantly timeout so far compared to u2f
i've tested it on chrome 78, should work on lower versions in theory
opera won't do

I have the ledger firmware updated to 1.6.0, I use the USB connection and I have updated Crome to the latest version.
I claim reward with the version of pbca26 and the result is the same: REJECT in Ledger display and Error, Ledger device is unavailable! in the api.
Will it be fixed soon or maybe it is better to claim the rewards at the moment using two ledger devices and the BIP 39 Mnemonic code converter?

[28-Nov-19 02:03 PM] pbca26#5430
which os are you using and at which step you get the error @Elmis 
i've tried chrome 78 on mac and win 10, both worked fine
i assume you opened kmd app on ledger as well? that could also be a reason for "Ledger device is unavailable!" error

[28-Nov-19 02:05 PM] pbca26#5430
also, make sure to allow chrome to access nano s
you should see similar popups if you click in the lock icon
one screen is after connect approval and one is prior to that

[28-Nov-19 02:42 PM] KOSIUS#0001
@pbca26 worked flawlessly, thanks!

[28-Nov-19 05:51 PM] yeamanjam#2841
@pbca26 I get all the way to the final part and get the following error  Error
Failed to sign with Ledger device: U2F DEVICE_INELIGIBLE,  its the approve transaction on your device after carefully reviewing....  it sends the info to the device, gives me the approve, i approve and then get the error.  Im using windows 10 the newest chrome and updated firmware.   Pop ups are allowed as well, Any ideas where i am going wrong?

[28-Nov-19 07:07 PM] pbca26#5430
if you're on fw 1.6.0 try to use the link i posted above

[28-Nov-19 08:16 PM] yeamanjam#2841
I did and thats how i got the error.  Evrything works except for the last two check marks in the claim process

[28-Nov-19 08:47 PM] Elmis#0347
I'm using windows 10, when clicking in the log icon, pop ups are allow but I cant see Nano S. and after claiming, pop up window says unknow device and red label says Error
Ledger device is unavailable!

[29-Nov-19 08:26 AM] pbca26#5430
@yeamanjam @Elmis can you both try to "Hold down Ctrl and press F5" while on
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb. In case it still won't work clear browser cache manually. If you still see U2F error it indicates that webusb fix is not activated on your end for some reason. If you're unable to connect nano s as depicted here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502811530002300939/649611344861200394/Screen_Shot_2019-11-28_at_5.02.10_PM.png it also means webusb fix is not enabled.
