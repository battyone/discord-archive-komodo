I just pass some params to the ledger library

[11-Jan-19 11:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
And the transaction creation and signing all happens on the device

[15-Jan-19 04:27 AM] lukechilds#2707

Anyone in touch with @hyperDEX by any chance?

[15-Jan-19 04:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
If so, can you tell him to get in touch with me

[15-Jan-19 09:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
Anyone interested in beta testing Ledger KMD reward claims?

[15-Jan-19 09:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
I would recommend you have a spare Ledger and load it with test keys/funds for testing

If you're interested send me a DM and I'll give you details.

[16-Jan-19 10:34 AM] Cabey#3299
I've a spare ledger and can help if you need a tester

[16-Jan-19 10:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
Awesome, can you accept my friend request and I'll DM you with details

@lukechilds can't DM you

[16-Jan-19 09:06 PM] zatJUM#9924
@lukechilds I have a nano s too, but can't access the manager anymore (I wanted to upgrade the firmware and couldn't today)

[16-Jan-19 09:07 PM] zatJUM#9924
If you know how to recover easily I could help too, perhaps

[16-Jan-19 09:08 PM] SHossain#0007
download and install latest Ledger Live app > upgrade firmware and upgrade Komodo app

[16-Jan-19 09:09 PM] SHossain#0007
The Chrome apps are obsolete now. Ledger Live is the only way forwaard

[16-Jan-19 09:11 PM] zatJUM#9924
I have the latest ledger live app and I can't access the manager, so I can't upgrade fw

[16-Jan-19 09:11 PM] zatJUM#9924
(timeout)

[16-Jan-19 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
which version of Ledger Live you have?

[16-Jan-19 09:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
1.3.0

[16-Jan-19 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
i used that today to upgrade firmware

[16-Jan-19 09:17 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe try restarting your computer

[16-Jan-19 09:18 PM] zatJUM#9924
yes, I try that tomorrow

[16-Jan-19 09:18 PM] zatJUM#9924

@zatJUM Seems I've bricked my Nano S this morning when tried to update the firmware. Have a `mcu firmware is not genuine` error and no any workarounds helped so far - so be careful with updating (ensure that you keep your seed in a save place before make update)

[17-Jan-19 08:12 AM] zatJUM#9924
Thanks @TonyL Have you reseted yours or is it definitly dead?

[17-Jan-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried to reset many ways but it seems dead

[17-Jan-19 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway I've decided to not use it when urgently needed to transfer some KMD and their server was unavailable and not had seed with me

[17-Jan-19 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
So not upset much haha

[17-Jan-19 08:17 AM] zatJUM#9924
Hope they fix that! Have you reported the issue?

[17-Jan-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope I didn't, I'm afraid that it'll eat much time since first they will send me to the support articles which I've already tried.
Is it fine now on your side?

[17-Jan-19 08:19 AM] zatJUM#9924
Not yet, I'll check that in a few hours I hope

[17-Jan-19 08:20 AM] zatJUM#9924
You should at least issue a warning on their github, don't you think so?

https://twitter.com/LedgerHQ/status/1085472783914684417 also people reporting that it not support more that 2 apps at the same time after this update
I've not deleted applications from my ledger before update - so I think it's caused the issue during the firmware update

Curious. After a new try, I succeeded to connect to manager (I had same problem as the ones complaining about the new firmware)

[18-Jan-19 08:31 AM] zatJUM#9924
@lukechilds Now I can make tests for you on my ledger (I haven't upgraded fw)

[18-Jan-19 08:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
@zatJUM great, can you send me a friend request so I can DM you?

[18-Jan-19 08:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
It should be ok if you don't upgrade the firmware, but you need to be on the latest KMD app

[18-Jan-19 08:37 AM] zatJUM#9924
I installed it a few days/weeks ago. How can I check the version? On manager it says 1.2.11, but I don't know if it's the version available or the installed one

[18-Jan-19 08:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can open the app on your device and go down to "about" or "info" or something

[18-Jan-19 08:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
that will display the version

[18-Jan-19 08:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
but you'll probably have to update, the new version was released very recently

[18-Jan-19 08:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
1.3.3 is what you want

ok

[18-Jan-19 08:47 AM] zatJUM#9924
deleted it from my device, but manager still offers me 1.2.11

[18-Jan-19 08:48 AM] zatJUM#9924
ledger live 1.3

[18-Jan-19 08:48 AM] zatJUM#9924
is it the problem?

[18-Jan-19 08:52 AM] zatJUM#9924
your github link says "Merge Sapling to main branch on firmware 1.5"

[18-Jan-19 08:52 AM] zatJUM#9924
But I'm on 1.4.2

[18-Jan-19 08:52 AM] zatJUM#9924
And you told me "It should be ok if you don't upgrade the firmware"

[18-Jan-19 08:52 AM] zatJUM#9924
What should I do?

[18-Jan-19 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
In that commit they reference that latest app version which is 1.3.3

[18-Jan-19 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
KMD app not Ledger Live

[18-Jan-19 09:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
strange, maybe they are blocking the app downloads for people on older firmware versions

[18-Jan-19 09:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can try the app anyway, if you get an error signing the transaction it means you aren't using a sapling capable device

You should update your kmd app through ledger live and try it

I also have to mention the KMD experience on Ledger Live is very bad.
And I mean really bad. It works but it throws out a bunch of errors on every interaction.
Compared to Zcash which works smoothly, zero errors. Sigh.

[08-Feb-19 11:48 AM] phideas#8309
@lukechilds  how could it be improved? are you or anyone from the team in touch with Ledger devs?
