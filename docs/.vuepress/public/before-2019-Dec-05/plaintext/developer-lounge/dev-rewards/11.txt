[13-Dec-18 05:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c is there an initial block height that interest was activated?

[13-Dec-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
aka, if there is a UTXO from block 2 that still hasn't been spent, should it have accrued interest?

[13-Dec-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is there a certain checkpoint where interest started?

[13-Dec-18 06:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
because if I need to account for that and someone has a really old UTXO in their wallet since before interest was activated, I'm going to try and credit them with a years worth of interest on that UTXO in the claim transaction. If that's not how the `komodod` consensus rules work then it'll ended being an invalid transaction.

Just wondering if I need to add a:

```
if (height < KOMODO_INTEREST_START) {
  return 0;
}
```

check to account for this

[13-Dec-18 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
height 1 is the start, but it is capped at one year

[13-Dec-18 10:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
Ok great, no adjustments needed then

Btw @CHMEX you might want to consider adding a license to that repo.

Any code that doesn’t specify a license is automatically considered "all rights reserved" by its author. You could technically assert your copyright at any time in the future and demand people stop using it. So not including a license is actually more likely to stop people using it than encourage use.

If you cba to think about it and don't really care I'd recommend the MIT license. That's what Bitcoin/Zcash/Komodo use and it's what I use for all my projects.

It basically means you waive all rights to the code, anyone can use it for anything without asking you for permission. The only requirement is that they provide attribution to you (normally by distributing the license file with you name in inside their work).

[14-Dec-18 01:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
If you want to do that just copy this file and put it in the root of your project and change replace the copyright statements with your own: https://github.com/atomiclabs/komodo-ledger-reward-claim/blob/master/LICENSE

@lukechilds  Thanks a lot for your input. That's all very new to me so I added the MIT license. and put some reference to komodo including the supernet copyright text. I hope that's ok.

@jl777c has anything changed with Sapling that would require changes to simple P2PKH transactions?

[24-Dec-18 08:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
The reward claim transaction signed on the Ledger by our app are now getting rejected by the network

[24-Dec-18 08:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
The exact same code generating the transactions before sapling worked

[24-Dec-18 08:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c looking through recent transactions it looks like I just need to set the version byte to `4` instead of `1`. Is that the case? Literally just the version byte needs changing and nothing else? Or do I need to change the way the transaction is structured at all?

[24-Dec-18 08:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahh fuck

[24-Dec-18 08:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's probably going to completely break Ledger support :/

[24-Dec-18 08:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User are there any docs you can point me to on how transactions need to be formed?

[24-Dec-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
All transactions are created and signed on the actual Ledger device itself

[24-Dec-18 09:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
so we can't use a client side lib

[24-Dec-18 09:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
Ahh, yeah, there is a Zcash app, will check that

[24-Dec-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Dec-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c is it identical to Zcash or are there differences between Zcash and Komodo txs?

[24-Dec-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
identical

[24-Dec-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
other than rewards

[24-Dec-18 09:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
Great, ok, looks like Ledger support Zcash so we should be able to get Ledger support back fro Komodo without too much trouble

[24-Dec-18 09:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
although I think it will require Ledger firmware changes

[24-Dec-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard they are working on a release

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
For Komodo or Zcash?

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
zcash

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think they already support P2PKH TXs on Zcash

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
just not sapling

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't actually know though

[24-Dec-18 09:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
any chance you could send me a tiny bit of Zcash dust to test?

[24-Dec-18 09:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't hold any

[24-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
all ZEC tx now are sapling

[24-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have any ZEC

[24-Dec-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok no worries, will get some

[24-Dec-18 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
what is the difference between sapling and overwinter btw?

[24-Dec-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see two branches on Ledger's GitHub `zcash_sapling` and `zcash_overwinter`

[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
dm `zcash_overwinter` branch is merged in to `zcash_spaling`

[24-Dec-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
and they are activating it for Komodo too

so hopefully that will be out shortly

[24-Dec-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
overwinter did some (or all?) of the txformat changes, but had no sapling. but it applies to taddr also

[24-Dec-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling has overwinter active and also of course does sapling tx

[24-Dec-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, one of the new fields in the tx serialization is the net change in sapling funds, so for overwinter that was either not there or always 0

[24-Dec-18 11:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok thanks

[24-Dec-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've built Ledger's sapling Komodo branch and loaded it on to my Ledger but I'm not having any luck getting transactions signed 🤔

[24-Dec-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
Will need to talk to Ledger devs

[24-Dec-18 11:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
hopefully they don't take too long

[03-Jan-19 09:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c I played around with ledgers overwinter branch firmware a bit more and managed to get it to sign a TX

[03-Jan-19 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
there are still no docs on how to use it and Ledger haven't got back to me

[03-Jan-19 09:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
But I think it might be a kind of frankenstein half legacy half overwinter TX

[03-Jan-19 09:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
This is the hex I got out of the Ledger:

```
030000807082c403010845939b29c05c4d4f90e126cbc3a58e9cd7adea2206dbcbbe7083a95ef0425c000000006a4730440220290c8ad74d672b2d15413583cc56382c40d1d784e8cc2952af00b74f0a52abaf022056a1532c04d1ca8af2a865d1d1578bad0837acae6856165267a5acd30396d415012102afca3a131439974f65c46be8d6748e4861db8ae7101d5738e17fc820a869749affffffff02aa2c683c000000001976a9144ea0aea7c13f6193a9c0effc9752eb2f8e520ba888acb36c0200000000001976a9147a0080f135c6cc311b3756cf3b7f070b65b5b41e88ac0000000000ffd12d5c
```

[03-Jan-19 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
and instead of the normal error:

```
16: tx-overwinter-active
```

I got this:

```
TX decode failed. Code:-22
```

[03-Jan-19 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
so obvs looks like I've got it to mangle the TX

[03-Jan-19 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
but if you have a chacne to take alook at the hex and could give me any pointers as to where the TX is mangled that might help me figure out how to get overwinter working with Ledger

[03-Jan-19 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
any help would be appreciated 🙏

[03-Jan-19 09:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
Managed to get one with `0x04` prefix too, which is I think what I'm aiming for?

000000000000000000000000000000cfd72d5c
looks like it needs to be
cfd72d5c000000000000000000000000000000
if cfd72d5c is locktime

[03-Jan-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
where it used to be
```hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)```
it's now
```hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
nExpiryHeight of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
valueBalance of the transaction (8-byte little endian)```

[03-Jan-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 2 new fields added

[04-Jan-19 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks a lot guys, will pass .  it on to ledger devs

[04-Jan-19 02:38 AM] lukechilds#2707

[04-Jan-19 06:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm assuming the outputscript has the same format with overwinter TXs right?

[04-Jan-19 06:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
just other parts of the transaction have changed

[04-Jan-19 08:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, the app is done, just waiting on Ledger to fix overwinter support 🎉

Our Ledger $KMD Reward Claim app is finally done!

Unfortunately, due to the hardfork there are some updates required to the Ledger firmware before it can sign transactions properly. But once the @LedgerHQ team have that sorted we're ready to rock and roll!

`I'm assuming the outputscript has the same format with overwinter TXs right?`
afaik, basically it's the tx "container" (for lack of a better descriptive term) that changed and the description of the tx (ins and outs) is still the same

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yeah that makes sense

I'm having weird issues with the Ledger but it looks like firmware issues on their end

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
I finally got it to sign an overwinter TX

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but only with none overwinter UTXOs

[04-Jan-19 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
and only without locktime

[04-Jan-19 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
setting locktime or using overwinter UTXOs produces a mangled TX

[04-Jan-19 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I've reported everything to Ledger so will wait to hear back from them

[04-Jan-19 02:26 PM] PTYX#6840
Magnum team pushed the fix for the Ledger app to the ledger team around a week ago. Ledger  responded and said it would be merged in the first 2 weeks of January. So ledger tx's should start working again after that is added.
