anyone here played around with Mylo's docker images?

[27-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to write tech docs for these tutorial walkthroughs he made, and I need some help getting docker to run.

[27-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Even someone who is familiar with docker could probably help.

Hi guys,I have a project ready to go most suitable for the Komodo Blockchain.I need Dev's from the Komodo community to contribute and make it happen.The project has physical world application.

[27-Jun-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if you offer bounties, then it is much more likely to get active contributors. unless it is some simple things that are close to what already exists

[27-Jun-19 07:24 AM] Art.F#5377
Of course there are bounties .The Dev's get % from the first crowdfunding and a certain amount of tokens.

[27-Jun-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
more details would be needed to get interested devs

[27-Jun-19 07:32 AM] Art.F#5377
I have a white paper draft ready.I have a platform structure ready.

Guys, if i get the 
[Payments]  [zexo] Error sending payments {"code":-5,"message":"Invalid Zcash address: "}
are there somewhere i have to state what kind of coin that is transffered? that its not a zcash address, cus its not 😃

[27-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Oszy#5734
either way the address is invalid

[27-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Oszy#5734
doing it from CLI?

[27-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Biotech#6005
the zexo address is valid

[27-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Biotech#6005
knomp's that are doing the payouts

[27-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Oszy#5734
oh

[27-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Oszy#5734
paste what's the command you run

[27-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Oszy#5734
might justbe formatting

[27-Jun-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Biotech what is the zaddy you have in your config?

[27-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Biotech#6005
inside the coins/ or pool_config/ file?

[27-Jun-19 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pool

[27-Jun-19 10:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there shouldn't be any addys, at all, in the config in the coins dir

[27-Jun-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes to take a 🛀🏽 and try to figure out how to even more simplify the concept of shielding addresses for entry-level pool ops_

_decides that it was toughly explained 2 years ago in <https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2448> and he doesn't know how to explain it better_

[27-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Biotech#6005
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  can you check your priv msg?

[27-Jun-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I turned them off entirely, because I don't know how to better explain the basics than they've been explained and documented a million times
if you choose to shield your coinbase transactions then you must provide a valid z address; no one else can know what it/isn't invalid in your config if/when you refuse to provide details of your config 🤷🏽

[27-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Biotech#6005
nono, ive gotten the transfer to work :)
I just wanted to know if you had the user/pass for the knomp-solo you have on git.

[27-Jun-19 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do what?

[27-Jun-19 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you're asking if I literally use "MyUser" and "MyPass", the answer is "no" those are what we call "examples"

[27-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Biotech#6005
think ure missunderstanding. Im trying to clone github.com/TheComputerGenie/Knomp-solo
but it asks for user/pass to get access to it. Thought maybe you knew something about it.

[27-Jun-19 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
probably because no such repo exists

[27-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Oszy#5734
`If Git prompts you for a username and password every time you try to interact with GitHub, you're probably using the HTTPS clone URL for your repository.`

[27-Jun-19 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not that, he'd need my ssh keys to create a repo under my name

[27-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Oszy#5734
ah ok

[27-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Biotech#6005
ahhh, thnx, didnt know that was the case.
i was reading up on how to setup a solo pool, thats where i found that repo im talking about.
guess its wrong then.

[27-Jun-19 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Knomp-solo was a repo that I **did** have long ago and was deleted last year

[27-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Biotech#6005
sorry to bother you with all this, but thnx for clearing things up. and thnx for the help.

Hi! I normally know how z_shieldcoinbase works. but on komodo it does not work. any ideas why?

Komodo is transparent only tx. The ztransactions are disabled now. You can do tx between transparent addresses. Do not try to shield kmd

[28-Jun-19 06:29 AM] ThomasBlock#6830
Ah ok thank you. only found this documentation, should probably be updated.. ( https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#z-shieldcoinbase )

dumb question...   actually I'm sort of answering it myself but I'm not confident enough in the answer...

[29-Jun-19 05:55 PM] smellycouch#3071
so, anyone can easy-mine to a notary pubkey if they really feel the urge

[29-Jun-19 05:56 PM] smellycouch#3071
what would stop someone from setting up 64 easy-mining nodes and mining 80 out of the next 100 blocks?

[29-Jun-19 05:56 PM] smellycouch#3071
Or, is there really nothing stopping that, except the fact that there is no incentive,

[29-Jun-19 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
not allowed

[29-Jun-19 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
notary mined needs to be notary signed too

[29-Jun-19 05:59 PM] smellycouch#3071
as in it needs to prove that it owns the address to the pubkey?

[29-Jun-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Jun-19 06:23 PM] smellycouch#3071

I'm a problem child

[29-Jun-19 06:35 PM] smellycouch#3071
so, i was under the impression that ratification does not happen on every block but just periodicially?  So....am I mistaken, or does this only prevent consecutive forged mining?

[29-Jun-19 06:35 PM] smellycouch#3071
Would it still be possible to forge a pubkey for say, one block?

[29-Jun-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
how?

[29-Jun-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to sign with the matching privkey

[29-Jun-19 06:35 PM] smellycouch#3071
"forge" isn't really the right word, sorry,

[29-Jun-19 06:36 PM] smellycouch#3071
oh, on every block?  sorry.  I misunderstood then

[29-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is easy mined

[29-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it is actually not related to notarizations at all

[29-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
just that the same pubkeys that notarize get to easy mine

[29-Jun-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
two totally different processes

[29-Jun-19 06:37 PM] smellycouch#3071
totally understand, just handled by the same pubkey/smart address

[29-Jun-19 06:39 PM] smellycouch#3071
so ratification is also bad terminology.   Basically I understand now that every single easy block must be signed with the private key of the notary pubkey (not ratification), and there is never any external mining of notary pubkeys of any kind except by extreme, extreme luck.

[29-Jun-19 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
only the notary privkey can easy mine

Prior to Overwinter the amount parameter was not required

[30-Jun-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
is it possible the documentation wasnt updated?

[30-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL my python problem is on a ubutnu 16.04 docker image.   i'll use 18.04 for my next test.  sorry for the bother

[30-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Mylo#8306
any devs have opinions on database dimensioning?

[30-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Mylo#8306
experience > opinions btw 😃

[30-Jun-19 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
i have an option to run:
1) large database with N number of tables
2) large database with 1 table and use an identifier column
3) seperate database for each table

i think i prefer option 3 because then it's not a monolithic admin thing in the future.

[30-Jun-19 10:44 AM] Mylo#8306
the tables are block data for each chain in the ecosystem

[30-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Mylo#8306
so in 12 months time
option 1) would grow by 1 record per block (500k records per year)
option 2) would grow by and obscene amount
option 3) would be like option1 but easier to move servers/services in the future

[30-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Mylo#8306
again, i think i prefer option 3.

[30-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Mylo#8306
if nobody has any experience, i'll ask in stackoverflow.

[30-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Mylo#8306

@Deleted User since sapling is activated know amount of each vin is mandatory to sign transaction, bcz it's part of preimage hash. Read ZIP-0243 https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0243.rst for details.

I would do separate DB for each year (if you logging blockchain blocks)  with proper indexing.

[30-Jun-19 10:59 AM] Oszy#5734
1 db with 1 table can get very messy, not at the beginning but later.
ofc it depends on the number of rows in the table and how you optimize the queries

[30-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Oszy#5734
my advise, try it all, and compare speed. fill up the db with dummy data, and test.  it also depends on how you host the db, locally or cloud, and what the server resources are.

[30-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
it's required if you're signing a tx with a daemon that has no knowledge of the previous utxos if I remember correctly

[30-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
not required for everything, but for example, if you wanted to sign a KMD tx with an assetchain daemon, you would need to provide it

[30-Jun-19 01:38 PM] Mylo#8306
@Oszy thanks.  Yeah 1 table sounds a mess.  Separate db per chain  I think is best.
@Deleted User preimage is a maths term.  Search for maths preimage.  It is jargon for something simple in concept iirc

[30-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
what is it you're trying to do?

[30-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
reread the above, we might be talking about different things

[30-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
