haha

[18-Jan-19 01:23 PM] jorian#4555
and then when you're done, create magic dApps in Go

[18-Jan-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no then create my own custom CC 🙂

[18-Jan-19 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
even better

[18-Jan-19 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also learning C in parallel 😉

[18-Jan-19 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
nice

[18-Jan-19 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can embed C/C++ code *inside* go code!

[18-Jan-19 01:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there's a `cgo` compile for C/C++

[18-Jan-19 01:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
when I got stuck in my early days of being IT student, I was stuck at understanding of making OOPs based code in C++

[18-Jan-19 01:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that again I think because I did not do efforts on my fundamentals learning 😄

[18-Jan-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
now those are clear with go

[18-Jan-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm sure I'll do better with C/C++ now

[18-Jan-19 01:30 PM] jorian#4555
fundamentals yes

[18-Jan-19 01:30 PM] jorian#4555
important to know them

[18-Jan-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I learned it harder way 😄

JS not having types makes it much more error prone

[18-Jan-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
advantage is anybody can copy paste code around and maybe it doesnt crash

[18-Jan-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
are there any miners written in js?

[18-Jan-19 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll also try not to call external libraries in my package, and instead of just calling them, would try my best to just explore them, get the part of code I need and put that in my kmdgo lib, so that there is no such chances of possible vulnerabilities through 3rd party libs with kmdgo

[18-Jan-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
how well do these js miners perform compared to one in a real language

[18-Jan-19 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
As I know there is typescript to write JS with types

[18-Jan-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
who needs an extra 50% of mining revenues

You'd be amazed at how many miners are just a ripoff of some other one with the dev fees changed

[18-Jan-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought miners went crazy over a 4% revenue boost

[18-Jan-19 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's lots of ways to interpret certain datasets

[18-Jan-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
webasm miners are about 10X slower than running on CLI, from my hushwebminer tests

[18-Jan-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
often, you can use free power, so that offsets it a bit. Mostly it's for botnets

[18-Jan-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i missed your tests question from a while ago, not sure what you meant

[18-Jan-19 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto it was about to make sure that `walletpassphrase` is being prompt for all the APIs where it is supposed it

[18-Jan-19 02:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
since it's coming back to KMD chain

[18-Jan-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
never used it, but yeah, tests are good 😃

[18-Jan-19 02:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is a very detailed article about mostly XMR webmining, but has others, downloaded from arXiv

[18-Jan-19 02:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
it identifies long-running webmining botnets and how much XMR they mined. they estimate botnets have mined at least 4% of XMR supply

[18-Jan-19 02:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
given that those cpu's are mining against GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs, that is quite a lot to mine with CPUs

[18-Jan-19 02:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder testing things that interactively prompt user can be annoying, sometimes

[18-Jan-19 02:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true

[18-Jan-19 02:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know which API calls should prompt for walletpassphrase if wallet is not unlocked. so was asking it here

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for some APIs it did not ask, like getaddress etc.

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
when did that stuff get deleted from KMD?

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
thought we kept all the wallet encryption stuff

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC still has it, i think

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thought since wallet it encrypted it should not generate new address and add that to wallet 🤔

[18-Jan-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it was there all along

[18-Jan-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
just was debug mode to enable encryption so very few encrypted wallets

[18-Jan-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
without encrypted wallet, no need for walletpassphrase

[18-Jan-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
one way you can deal with this is to issue the rpc and if it says needs password in the return then prompt the user

@grewalsatinder ^^

[18-Jan-19 02:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I know some ways to handle that from early `Iguana` Wallet days. 🙂

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`walletpassphrasechange` 🤔

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't seen it in `komodo-cli help`

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also didn't see `walletpassphrase` in help output

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just added that myself to kmdgo package

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
please unhide or show it in `help` output

[18-Jan-19 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c

[18-Jan-19 02:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the API works, just dosn't shows in `komodo-cli help`

[18-Jan-19 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder various RPCs are hidden from help 😃

they have "hidden" category, search for that

[18-Jan-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need to remove that

[18-Jan-19 02:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto didn't check.... will do 😄

[18-Jan-19 02:24 PM] dukeleto#7326

not too many, btc core has lots more

[18-Jan-19 02:25 PM] dukeleto#7326

I have been making progress on adding dpow to SUQA, NNs should be able to test it sometime soon

they hid all the rpcs that are useful for attacks

[19-Jan-19 03:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
added all commands under Wallet to kmdgo package.
leaving the sprout zc commands to do later:
```- [ ]    zcbenchmark benchmarktype samplecount -- Todo
- [ ]    zcrawjoinsplit rawtx inputs outputs vpub_old vpub_new  -- Todo
- [ ]    zcrawkeygen  -- Todo
- [ ]    zcrawreceive zcsecretkey encryptednote  -- Todo
- [ ]    zcsamplejoinsplit  -- Todo
```

I need to enable the optional params in all methods.... doesn't feel right has to give all params value.

[19-Jan-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i think some of that zc stuff was removed upstream, it's really old pre 1.0 zec stuff. `zc` is for zerocoin

[19-Jan-19 09:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Oh Okay 
Good! In that case I think almost all basic kmd API are in kmdgo now

[19-Jan-19 09:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But I didn't adopt the optional params thing. Has to give all params including default. Will push update to enable optional params next.

[20-Jan-19 03:36 PM] jorian#4555
@grewalsatinder did you run into any issues with addnode, clearbanned etc? komodod doesn't return a response on success. i'm fighting with Rust to make it work

[20-Jan-19 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian no issues. yes, they don't give any response. that means if response is not nil, or error code is not 0, there is some error.

[20-Jan-19 11:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian you were right, I also get to test, try and learn every single API I added to kmdgo 😄

[20-Jan-19 11:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
never done that all and see what each does

writing a library binding is a very good way to learn the entire RPC interface :abusedsmily:

True mate

[21-Jan-19 02:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am making all RPCs which return `confirmations` or take a `minconf` param dpow-aware in 5 different coins, including KMD, and it's a lesson in diversity

[21-Jan-19 04:33 AM] Mylo#8306
Looks bigint (js) has made its way into Firefox from chrome.  I’ll revisit my js browser lib this week to test using browser native fetch() and bigint for a cpl methods.

[21-Jan-19 04:34 AM] Mylo#8306

[22-Jan-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think maybe that is a bug in KMD's build.sh

[22-Jan-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
gcc version 7.3.0 (Homebrew GCC 7.3.0) on os x

[22-Jan-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmmm

[22-Jan-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think i ran build.sh using CC pointed to a different compiler at first, then not using CC env var later confuses the build system

[22-Jan-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
probably a case of "don't do that"

[22-Jan-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the more compilers that exist is the swampier scripts get trying to account for them all
when I was still running "jessie" I had to manually edit make files for 2/3rds of projects because of stuff like that

[23-Jan-19 01:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
i maintain CPAN modules which have C extensions in XS ... and yeah, sometimes I get error reports for VAX or netBSD compilers and crazy stuff. Supporting all compilers is a death of a thousand cuts
