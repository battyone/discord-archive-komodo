that is the segid for each address

[23-Mar-19 12:24 AM] zack#6467
normally a blockchain can't see a unit of time less than 600 seconds, but this one can enforce rules only 2 seconds long.

[23-Mar-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
well it is based on the blocktimestamp submitted

[23-Mar-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if you use a timestamp from too far in the future, the nodes will reject it

[23-Mar-19 12:25 AM] zack#6467
Why does each group only have 2 seconds to stake?
Does that mean their money is only locked up for 2 seconds? or that they have 2 seconds to initialize a bond?

[23-Mar-19 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
no they become eligible with 2 seconds delay for each segid (on a rotating basis each block)

[23-Mar-19 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
once eligible, a segid stays eligible for that block

[23-Mar-19 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
over time all segids get equal "early" eligibility and "late" eligibility

[23-Mar-19 12:26 AM] zack#6467
this is a protocol for choosing the block creator? we need 1 leader?

[23-Mar-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a difficulty that the stake weighted calculation needs to be below

[23-Mar-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so the bigger it is and the older a utxo is, the more likely it will be able to stake a block

[23-Mar-19 12:28 AM] zack#6467
"stake a block" means you get to be the block creator and gather all the txs into the next block?

[23-Mar-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
stake a block is just like PoW mining that block, except instead of a hash value, it is based on the stake/age

[23-Mar-19 12:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so all the tx already need to be in the block you are staking

[23-Mar-19 12:29 AM] zack#6467
you spend coin-age to pay for creating a block.

Usually when people say "stake" they mean that money is locked up in a security deposit for an extended period of time.

[23-Mar-19 12:30 AM] zack#6467
so "stake" usually refers to the time period when you are accumulating coin-days, not the moment when you spend coin-days.

[23-Mar-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i just do a stake and age based calc of a hash and compare it to the diff to see if the block wins

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if more stake is active then blocks come in fast, it becomes harder diff

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] zack#6467
so, who makes the block, if the staker does not?

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
someone must stake a block

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] zack#6467
so the staker is the block maker?

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that is like asking who makes the block if there are no miners

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
By the looks of it we need a #zack channel.   Thousands of messages here üòÉ

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, staking is almost identical to mining

[23-Mar-19 12:31 AM] zack#6467
I thought you said that the block is made before anyone stakes it

[23-Mar-19 12:32 AM] zack#6467
right so stakers are the block makers

[23-Mar-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
when you mine, you need to create the block to have the blockheader to change the nonce in to mine it

[23-Mar-19 12:33 AM] jl777c#5810
similarily when staking you need to have the block made already so it can be validated

[23-Mar-19 12:33 AM] jl777c#5810
well maybe you can do a stake calculation independently of the block construction, but it seems not much point

[23-Mar-19 12:34 AM] zack#6467
I was working on some random sampling POS systems like 4 years ago. I am trying to remember the set of attacks that I couldn't solve.

[23-Mar-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
as you need a block to submit if you have a winning utxo.

[23-Mar-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
stake grinding ?

[23-Mar-19 12:35 AM] zack#6467
oh yeah, the random number system is important for random sampling

[23-Mar-19 12:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the PoS calculation cant rely on anything you can iterate through, or it allows stake grinding, which is a fatal attack against a PoS system

[23-Mar-19 12:35 AM] zack#6467
I think a more fundamental problem is that random sampling is on some level equivalent to a voting mechanism.
Instead of each person having a small voice, they have a small probability of a big voice.

[23-Mar-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with the PoS64, you want to spread your stake out across 64 addresses, but then you cant really dominate as someone with even a small stake can put all in a single segment

[23-Mar-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and which segid you are in is the most important aspect and that cant be changed without losing all coinage

[23-Mar-19 12:38 AM] zack#6467
the attacker would make an alternative version of the full node, and any staker using it would earn like 2% more money than they would earn otherwise.
Once enough people are using the alternative full node, then the attack starts.

[23-Mar-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
with PoS64 actively managing your stake seems to be very effective to boost the percentage of blocks you can get

[23-Mar-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the source of entropy is the previous 100 segids

[23-Mar-19 12:40 AM] zack#6467
if the attacker has >50% of coin-age using his alternative full node, he can block everyone who isn't participating in the attack from making blocks

[23-Mar-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a cap on coinage of a month

[23-Mar-19 12:40 AM] zack#6467
previous 100 segids huh?
each segid is a number between 1 and 64, right?

[23-Mar-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
0 and 63

[23-Mar-19 12:41 AM] zack#6467
so each participant can only add like 1 bit to entropy, that sounds like a secure source of entropy.

[23-Mar-19 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i was happy with it, for a while it looked like a big problem

[23-Mar-19 12:42 AM] zack#6467
I think an attacker making an alternative version of the full node is a pretty serious vulnerability

[23-Mar-19 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what does this alternate node do? it stillneeds to follow consensus

[23-Mar-19 12:43 AM] zack#6467
it follows consensus exactly normal, until like 60% of the staking power is using the attacker version

[23-Mar-19 12:43 AM] zack#6467
at that point it censors the 40% who did not participate in the attack.

[23-Mar-19 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so people dont know they are running this?

[23-Mar-19 12:44 AM] zack#6467
and uses censorship to do a soft fork to make arbitrary changes

[23-Mar-19 12:44 AM] zack#6467
they just know that the alternative version of the full node pays 2% more

[23-Mar-19 12:44 AM] zack#6467
you could warn them, but even if they know it is an attack, the nash equilibrium is to fall for the attack

[23-Mar-19 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
well if the majority of stake decides to run the attacker version, then it seems that is the new chain

[23-Mar-19 12:45 AM] zack#6467
haha

[23-Mar-19 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
100% PoS does seem very vulnerable, we dont recommend it

[23-Mar-19 12:45 AM] zack#6467
Well, Ive always wanted to do a malicious takeover of a blockchain

[23-Mar-19 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
a balance between PoW and PoS

[23-Mar-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you can try to take over the BEER chain

[23-Mar-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, that isnt PoS...

[23-Mar-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if people are running a rogue version, why wouldnt it just steal all the privkeys?

[23-Mar-19 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and how does it pay 2% more?

[23-Mar-19 12:47 AM] zack#6467
the attacker is paying the bribe

[23-Mar-19 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
or it is just a ploy to get people to run it?

[23-Mar-19 12:47 AM] zack#6467
if the alternative version just steals their private key, then the nash equilibrium is not to fall for the attack.

[23-Mar-19 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i see, it is a real 2%, then yes a lot of people just might use it, but it couldnt get any large installed based without being noticed

[23-Mar-19 12:48 AM] zack#6467
getting noticed doesn't matter. the nash equilibrium is still that the attack succeeeds.

[23-Mar-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
what about if it is 50% PoW/50% PoS

[23-Mar-19 12:49 AM] zack#6467
im not sure. it depends on the specifics of how you are meshing the two

[23-Mar-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
PoW diff adjuster

[23-Mar-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual percentage of past 100 blocks is compared to the desired percentage

[23-Mar-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if too much PoW, the diff is increased for PoW, if not enough, the diff is lowered

[23-Mar-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
overall the normal blocktime based diff adjustment happens based on all the blocks

[23-Mar-19 12:52 AM] zack#6467
so if you took over the PoS portion, and stopped making PoS blocks, then the block rate would just keep getting slower?

[23-Mar-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it will adjust the diff to make it easier to make blocks to try to keep the blocktime, but then PoW goes over the desired percentage and blocks slow down

[23-Mar-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
likely the chain could get stuck if everyone just stopped staking

[23-Mar-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
just the PoW required would be enormous

[23-Mar-19 12:54 AM] zack#6467
if the difficulty got too high, and then I suddenly started making PoS as fast as I could, then maybe 80% of blocks would be PoS for the next 100 blocks?

[23-Mar-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, you can play games to get some fast blocks for a short time

[23-Mar-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but once the past 100 blocks goes below the target the PoW becomes easier and easier

[23-Mar-19 12:56 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@zack While I do think you have some wrong base notions and I imagine that I matter as little to you as I do to most of the rest of the world, I want it to be said that I am glad you reached a point where you're questioning to actually learn and understand more and this space would be a dam'd sight better as a whole if more folks would do just that.

[23-Mar-19 12:56 AM] zack#6467
sometimes there are ways to oscillate systems like this to earn more profit.
If there is a part of the cycle where mining difficulty is a fraction of what it should be, then that means miners are way over-paid.

[23-Mar-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure you could actually get it to 80% with PoS. for PoW if you go from one core mining to a few Msols, it will get a lot of blocks until things adjust

[23-Mar-19 12:57 AM] zack#6467
and during the other part of the cycle, only altruists will mine

[23-Mar-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but with it being half PoS, it is just a matter of staking for half the blocks

[23-Mar-19 12:57 AM] zack#6467
so you could start the cycle pumping, then only mine during the profitable part of the cycle.

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and perfectly coordinate 3 different chains so you can always be making max profits!

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] zack#6467
you could do the bribery attack to control the majority of PoS blocks

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] zack#6467
haha, yeah, if you get multiple at once it is much more effective

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] zack#6467
that way there is no down time for miners

[23-Mar-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it all sounds so easy

[23-Mar-19 12:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but in reality the randomness would get in the way

[23-Mar-19 12:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and these are by and large lower value chains

[23-Mar-19 01:00 AM] zack#6467
if it is 50-50 pow/pos, and you can do a bribe attack to control 80% of the PoS. 
What would stop you from completing the rest of the attack?

[23-Mar-19 01:00 AM] zack#6467
how does randomness matter?

[23-Mar-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
sure if you can get 80% of the PoS blocks, 40% of total stake running your version, likely you own that chain

[23-Mar-19 01:01 AM] zack#6467
and we already know it is the nash equilibrium for stakers to participate in the attack.
So it seems inevitable that it will eventually happen.

[23-Mar-19 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems such a long winded attack though

[23-Mar-19 01:01 AM] zack#6467
I spent a lot of time working on PoS, but Amoveo is PoW.
