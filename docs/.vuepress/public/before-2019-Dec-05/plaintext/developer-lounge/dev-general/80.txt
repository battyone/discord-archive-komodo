@glx use this url, yours is insight explorer

@Nabob Amazing yes that works. If I wanted to display just the balance on a web page I would use this - https://glx.money/insight-api-komodo/addr/RV5DnD6FAbG733E3b8geVtkhFqNSP6vZQD/balance - do I need to place that inside some code?

[08-Dec-18 10:19 AM] TheTrunk#1040
ok cool, hopefully it will be soon as I need to update our explorer and prepare zelcore in time as well.

@TheTrunk here is the sapling ready insight explorer sourcce and guide https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install
We will announce when Komodo source and Agama wallet is ready. Currently we are testing.

I and @cYnIx come from the Commercium project, we are looking to swap to Komodo and snapshot the current chain and migrate the pubkey and balance to Komodo. We are also looking to have the chain pow and pos with staking. If anyone can point us in the right direction.

[08-Dec-18 06:11 PM] Alright#0419
Would recommend just trying out test chains to begin with

That was generated automatically using `getsnapshot` rpc on an asset chain. Might be able to port that rpc to your current chain, not sure

[08-Dec-18 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto is likely a good person to talk to about migrating

@pbca26 where to find the how to instructions for upgrading my asset chain Koinon for the upcoming Komodo Dec 15 fork?    What do I need to do?

[09-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Nabob#5004
You need to upgrade komodod binaries, so all asset chain has those upgraded code. If you are using Agama for launching your coin. please wait for new release build. Stay tuned to #officialüì¢.  @aseandude

hey guys, if you have multiple assets, how do they talk to each other? anything I can read up on?

[09-Dec-18 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
@riddler18k there are asset chains which are independent blockchains along with the assets contract which are non-fungible tokens that can be created on the independent blockchains. You're likely referring to the asset chains. They can "talk to each other" via Momom protocol.(merkle root of merkle root of merkle root) Momom data is included with each notarization, so any notarized chain can verify that a transaction happened on any other notarized chain

[09-Dec-18 08:03 PM] riddler18k#0791
sorry yes meant assets chains

[09-Dec-18 08:03 PM] riddler18k#0791

Not familiar with swarm, not sure what you mean

[09-Dec-18 08:07 PM] riddler18k#0791
thanks, I read that but didn't click re using it to verify different transactions on different chains!

[09-Dec-18 08:07 PM] riddler18k#0791
re swarm.. its file storage... say there is a file i want to store on decentralised storage.... how would I do it on KMD?

it's a rough PoC, but it works

[09-Dec-18 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
basically, spin up a permissioned chain, "stream" the file to it with that and have notaries notarize it

[09-Dec-18 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
You can do it on non-permissioned chains, but you'll be limited by block size and time

[09-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
@riddler18k if you're interested in playing around with that @blackjok3r is the man to talk to. He made it

thanks mate

[09-Dec-18 08:13 PM] riddler18k#0791
am thinking of who architecture of a project I have in mind

[09-Dec-18 08:14 PM] riddler18k#0791
I really like what you guys have done, just trying to understand a few basic things

[09-Dec-18 08:16 PM] riddler18k#0791
looking at https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html#creating-a-new-asset-chain it doesn't show parameter for blocksize so am presuming it is preset for a new chain right? We could only change it we were to fork KMD rather than create an asset chain....

It's 2mb on every asset chain right now. Changes to 4mb after December 15 hardfork

[09-Dec-18 08:17 PM] riddler18k#0791
aaah of course sapling üòÉ

[09-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
You should be able to create a new parameter to change blocksize then merge that into KMD

[09-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Alright#0419
or just set it manually and fork

[09-Dec-18 08:17 PM] riddler18k#0791
and in terms of transaction fee for a chain.... how/where is that set?

[09-Dec-18 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
do you want to set a minimum?

[09-Dec-18 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
it's not consensus enforced, miners can choose what they will put into blocks

[09-Dec-18 08:18 PM] riddler18k#0791
and if it's POS?

[09-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
It's still set by miner

[09-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Alright#0419
or staker if that's what you want to call it

[09-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Alright#0419
Do you want lower or higher fees than default?

[09-Dec-18 08:25 PM] riddler18k#0791
I was actually thinking of having a flat fee or being able to set that providing i can get all the miners to agree say every year or so

[09-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
Is allowing miners decide what they'll put into blocks not going to work with your chain?

[09-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
that's default behavior, comes from bitcoin

[09-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Alright#0419
so user can send a tx with no transaction fee, but it won't get confirmed until a miner who is allowing free transactions mines a block

[09-Dec-18 09:05 PM] riddler18k#0791
oh sorry misunderstood! yep of course standard behaviour, thinking about more on lines of having an asset to manage storage for my platform and how transaction costs would work

[09-Dec-18 11:28 PM] riddler18k#0791
Thanks for answering my questions @Alright

[09-Dec-18 11:28 PM] riddler18k#0791

[09-Dec-18 11:30 PM] riddler18k#0791
