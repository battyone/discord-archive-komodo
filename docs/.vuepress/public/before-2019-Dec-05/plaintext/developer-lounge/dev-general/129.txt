I wiped all executables, rebuilt on both nodes and issue resolved. Sorry for buzzing...

[27-Feb-19 07:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL maybe also wipe your datadir, not sure if that could be related

[27-Feb-19 07:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
`Error: Unable to start HTTP server` usually does mean something is already on that RPC port, but maybe some other conditions could lead to that

[27-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Mihailo#5902
@Bryan_Beus @gcharang I have looked at gateways documentation, and modifed errors and updated it to current flow. I think I covered everything right.

little by little progress: 
- able to get the state of gotty process from my go code, which I can now manage to direct actions and events based on it's state. The state is that once game ends, it closes the temporary http server created for it's web session via gotty. I had trouble getting the state of it's end process from gotty, which is now solved. just needed to keep trying and looking for different angle to get to point where I got now.
- Also learned to manage websockets via go using 3rd party go package gorilla, which is recommended by official go language as a reference until the official go websockets library complets. tested websockets with my rogue tty test code which works as I expect it to work.
- Now working on to the channels part. To direct the state of the game end to websockets at backend code written in go, which will pass that info to web html which can then take further action.

[28-Feb-19 06:24 PM] bedukfan#9576
hi. I am interested with fully decentralized exhanges. could you please explain  how the transfer gateway is decentralized ?

[28-Feb-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
in an atomic swap DEX, there is no transfer gateway

[28-Feb-19 06:45 PM] bedukfan#9576
then where do you use 1:1 peg tokens ?

[28-Feb-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be for an onchain token based trading. but we are more concentrating on the atomic swaps method

[28-Feb-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the 1:1 peg tokens can be used by various CC, so you can get CC functionality denominated in the external coin

[28-Feb-19 06:57 PM] bedukfan#9576
I am confused a bit. How it is possible that I do not pay tx fee when I use atomic swap. does not it require 1:1 peg tokens ?

[28-Feb-19 06:59 PM] bedukfan#9576
thanks for the answer. how is the order book is decentralized then ?

[28-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no centralized orderbook

[28-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the local orderbook is generated locally, based on all the bids/asks that have been broadcasted to the network

[28-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
at any given time, different nodes will construct different orderbooks, depending on what exactly they have seen

[28-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
seems pretty decentralized

[28-Feb-19 07:04 PM] bedukfan#9576
thank you !!

I"ll have a look over the weekend, should be able to tweak some of my existing code to periodically get the API json and write to oracle. Might need to setup a dedicated chain for the oracle storage, at the moment most of my oracles are on LABS chains which might not persist.

[02-Mar-19 03:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
btw, oracle.earth is displaying these, and allows read/write from form on site

[02-Mar-19 03:32 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
once API is linked to oracle, I can use a graphing framework for display. I havent used the twitter API yet but can loo into it.

[02-Mar-19 03:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator which language will you be working in? I use Net::Twitter in Perl but there are equivalent libs in other languages, that should make it easy for you to post to twitter

[02-Mar-19 03:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
python and/or js

[02-Mar-19 03:51 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
mapping stuff is js too, but I'm testing geodjango at the moment

[02-Mar-19 03:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
how much oracle stuff is only in LABS and not yet in KMD? I ask because I want to enable the oracle CC in Hush

[02-Mar-19 03:52 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
afaik, its just a matter of enabling it on chain launch

[02-Mar-19 03:53 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so any chain being created can enable it

[02-Mar-19 03:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
yep, HUSH is migrating to a KMD AC, so I will be enabling a few CCs that are stable-ish

[02-Mar-19 03:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
oracle, gateway and heir all interest me greatly

[02-Mar-19 03:56 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll be experimenting more with other CCs over the next few weeks. hir and gateways are a couple I've been wanting to play with for a while

@hypocalese i tip my hat to you

[02-Mar-19 04:31 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@dukeleto  `a bot that tweets which chains have the smallest/largest notarization lags`
by this do you mean time between ntx for each ac?

[02-Mar-19 04:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator there is a column on http://notarystats.com/ for `lag` which is `lag = chainTipHeight - notarizedHeight`

[02-Mar-19 04:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
lag is the number of blocks that can be potentially re-orged, currently

[02-Mar-19 04:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
lag changes every block, randomly

[02-Mar-19 04:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes it increases, sometimes it goes to 0, because chaintip is notarized. it's unpredictable

[02-Mar-19 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
and that unpredictability makes things harder for 51% attackers

[02-Mar-19 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator so yes, you were right, but in blocks, not in time

[02-Mar-19 04:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the fundamentals of go net/http is helping, :P
gonna play, hit and try with that new tries I'm doing with go channels riddle üòÅ 
There is one more alternative I found to websockets, Server-Side-Events. Didn't knew of those until today.
But, before I explore SSE, I'll just get my go channels riddle solved.

[02-Mar-19 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
each chain has a different block time, potentially. Hush will be the first AC with a blocktime of 150s

[02-Mar-19 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
all current KMD ACs have a 60s block time, but we have external coins with various blocktimes

[02-Mar-19 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, not sure thats within https://komodostats.com/api/explorer/#!/notary but should be able to derive it from explorer apis

[02-Mar-19 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator you should be able to manually subtract the latest block height from notarized height

[02-Mar-19 04:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
you are right, komodostats.com api does not give you `lag` directly, but you can calculate it

[02-Mar-19 04:35 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
would the twitbot bradcast on every ntx, or periodically (like every 10 min)?

[02-Mar-19 04:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
my thinking is, to make it a nice overview, and maybe once per hour

[02-Mar-19 04:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
so, the tweet would tell you: which chains have the "best" current dpow (lowest lags) and which have the "least" dpow protection (large lags)

[02-Mar-19 04:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe top 3 and bottom 3. that would be really useful info

[02-Mar-19 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm waiting for KMD to sync on the PC I just had to rebuild, so I'll see if I can pull some of this together  while waiting

[02-Mar-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is just one idea

[02-Mar-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
we don't have any historical graphs of lag over time for a chain, so this twitter bot would basically always highlight "these are the most secure chains and the least secure, right now"

[02-Mar-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
and we should expect that they change randomly. If they do not, and some coins are consistently in the bottom, that is something to look into

[02-Mar-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
totally different idea, is the twitter bot shows off ROGUE or some oracle stuff

[02-Mar-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
the main goal was to showcase cool KMD stuff via a twitter bot, the particulars can be chosen by the people that code it üòÉ

[02-Mar-19 04:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
first goal is a read-only twitter bot. Then, some kind of interactive twitter bot would be the next step. Maybe even something like "any tweets mentioning this bot go into this oracle" and it responds with a link to an explorer showing the transaction
