it seems is isnt in the DASH codebase

[29-Jan-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
i see now, i only have a stub definition in komodo_validation012.h, maybe they removed or changed the name of ImportAddress

[29-Jan-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are some weird changes

[29-Jan-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is no pwalletMain or vpwallets

[29-Jan-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
you must go thru this GetWallets() interface

[29-Jan-19 10:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
and i think this is related

[29-Jan-19 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
src/wallet/rpcdump.cpp
155:void ImportAddress(const CBitcoinAddress& address, const string& strLabel);
169:        ImportAddress(CBitcoinAddress(CScriptID(script)), strLabel);
173:void ImportAddress(const CBitcoinAddress& address, const string& strLabel)
231:        ImportAddress(address, strLabel);
293:    ImportAddress(CBitcoinAddress(pubKey.GetID()), strLabel);
```

[29-Jan-19 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's only in rpcdump.cpp

[29-Jan-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
so i guess my code is not linking with rpcdump.cpp

@blackjok3r @jl777c I'm having some strange behaviour of miner. When block is mined that node is stuck. Also I noticed in last few weeks when I start nodes they need some time before they start propagationg tx to the network...

dead locked? I thaught this was fixed?

[29-Jan-19 11:33 AM] Mihailo#5902
I'm on FSM from yesterday...

[29-Jan-19 11:34 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hmmm, or not.

[29-Jan-19 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[29-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
```if ( ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL[0] == 0 ||  (ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL[0] != 0 && !isStake) )

Make sure that that is in CreateBlock where ever it does return(0)

[29-Jan-19 11:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was the cause of lock up.

[29-Jan-19 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless this is something else that is

[29-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
I was on FSM from Jan 21

[29-Jan-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure what chian your using but there is one return without unlock in FSM, that is not in LABS.... maybe its this:

miner deadlock i think happened earlier, jan 11.

[29-Jan-19 12:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, still problem on latest FSM

[29-Jan-19 12:07 PM] Mihailo#5902
@blackjok3r Still blocking with unlock on that return

[29-Jan-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔 
Tracking that down was tricky... I had to attach GBD to it once it was locked, and then trace each thread until I found what was locking it up.

[29-Jan-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Havent had any problem with it since...

[29-Jan-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that said I am not on FSM... but we are pretty close to equal with it.

[29-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Mihailo#5902
I thought sam that I have to check every thread.

[29-Jan-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
get one that is in LOCK cs_main and then trace what owns it

[29-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
Did it long time ago, can you give me hints how to do it easy?

[29-Jan-19 12:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I followed youtube video it was very clear... let me see if I cn find it

[29-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Mihailo#5902
And why I need to attach after lock, can't run it with GDB?

[29-Jan-19 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you need to attack afterwards... or at least thats just how I did it

really not too sure... definatly seems a diffrent problem that what I fixed before

[29-Jan-19 12:59 PM] Mihailo#5902
I can start with fresh chain, as I used this for longer time. But I'm curious why this happens.

[29-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Mihailo#5902
If I understand correctly this is doing some checks of vins, and it never finishes so that control.Wait() waits indefinitely

[29-Jan-19 01:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Worst bugs man... I spent litteral days on those... Havent noticed anything locking up since.. BUt maybe we are doing dioffrent things.

Its entering a LOCK when its already in a lock.

@blackjok3r It seems miner only blocks when it mines a GatewaysClaim tx. It was working before, I must check what's going on

[29-Jan-19 01:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That might explain why we dont see any thing locking up.

So I get the basics of $KMD but there are a few things that are tripping me up here.

[30-Jan-19 12:54 AM] CryptoMedication#4824
Let's say I'm Charlie Lee. I come to Komodo and I want to secure Litecoin with Komodo's dpow. I tell you all work your magic. 

You notarize my blockchain on yours and also on Bitcoin, correct?

[30-Jan-19 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

- Rust

[30-Jan-19 01:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In any language which I mentioned

[30-Jan-19 01:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can use that in some of my future apps for dev tutorials

[30-Jan-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
@CryptoMedication  yes.  charlie, vitalik, johnny and joan doe.   anyone.  you.

one of those basics of KMD is to be able to create your own chain.

- "you" being a dev, and you can create an application specific chain and secure it to bitcoin hashrate.

or

-  you being a dev and your application wants to create a chain for "your user", so essentially your application will run a cluster of 10k chains.  Verus Coin project is doing something like this with public blockchains as a service for polls.  Each poll is just a short lived chain, maybe a day, maybe a week.

The notary network does the notarizations, but in the #kmdlabs they are making their own notary network that still does the YOURCHAIN->KMD notarization, but they'll be incentivizing their channel and their own notaries by other means.

There's nothing to stop in say 1000 days, 50 other notary networks being created.   If you have an application that requires 1 chain per user, maybe you'll have a partner network of B2B that can integrate related services and between your partner network, you're all incentivized to notarize (keep a healthy network) for different methods of rewards for maintaining a healthy ecosystem of your own.

[30-Jan-19 01:43 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g. KMD is the working tech of a proof of concept.  we all notarize to KMD when we need to, KMD goes into BTC.  We all piggy back off KMD tech, independently.

[30-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Mylo#8306
That's the security aspect 👆 


Now for scalability.   Instead of your application making 1 chain per user, it needs maximum throughput, of say 10k actions per second.   Then to achieve this, your application would run a cluster of chains, approx 100.   These 100 chains can interact with each other, through KMD's crypto conditions tech and act as one chain.  All your cluster will notarize to KMD and be able to interrogate KMD for past notarizations.  This interrogation is handled efficiently using a MoMoM (merkle root of merkle root of merkle root).  In your cluster, you want to maintain coin/token/etc. supply, so combined with MoMoM is a burn protocol, so within your cluster it's always got same balance.

[30-Jan-19 01:54 AM] Mylo#8306
That's one use of Crypto Conditions.

[30-Jan-19 02:02 AM] Mylo#8306
More uses of cryptoconditions include tokenization, interactivity between a user and chain, oracles for making off-chain data on-chain data thru your trusted application, and other things - not to be vague, but you basically can make any code part of the consensus.   If you wanted to make a  very ridiculousconsensus rule that a transaction needed human authorization e.g. by making a pop up saying "click me", and if the user clicks it's authorized and tx passes validity - or if it's not clicked, then the tx is rejected, then that is part of the consensus code, that silly pop up is now blockchain verifiable that someone clicked it.

More sensible uses are for time locked block rewards being paid when timelock expires to a group of ppl, like pool miners in a share system, or some other off-chain system that is oraclized, like how many goals were scored on playstation in the last 5 mins to those goal scorers.

[30-Jan-19 02:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Crypto Conditions + MoMoM between chains allows a lot of interoperability possibilities.   Basically make up the rules of interoperability, they will be validated that what happened at time X did happen when it happened, and that data can be validated across chains, for use in the future at time Y.

[30-Jan-19 02:04 AM] Mylo#8306
I"ve sat here with the devs in chat for 12+months, so if there's Qs, to that just ask.

[30-Jan-19 02:06 AM] Mylo#8306
you might have a curly question i can't answer, but there'll be someone that knows how to solve it

[30-Jan-19 02:14 AM] Mylo#8306
