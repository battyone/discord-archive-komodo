[16-Dec-18 03:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont understand

[16-Dec-18 03:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but its mining fine ?

[16-Dec-18 03:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[16-Dec-18 03:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r

[16-Dec-18 03:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[16-Dec-18 03:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely the other node mined the blocks inbetween

[16-Dec-18 03:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have two staking nodes only

[16-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant skip blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that cannot happen... so its likely just a print issue

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so what to do shall i stop ?

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the daemon

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if its staking leave it

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean why its skipping the blocks or they were previously staked :/

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
do you have `sapling : some number` in `getinfo`

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cant skip blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yeah its staking fine wait

[16-Dec-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it might njust be not printing them or something

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes sapling is 85088

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
sapling number

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
your fine then

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that isd the block sapling will activate on

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it has activated

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and you can make blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its fine

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai i was scared for a whiile ðŸ˜®

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and the other thing now i am trying to getinfo

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
after staking has started

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and it hangs ?

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes ðŸ˜„

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just wait it will work afer a few seconds

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
exactly

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the problem is the staking loop[ is in the wallet RPC code

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes success

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
"D

[16-Dec-18 03:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so while its trying to calculate its stake the RPC does not work.

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no idea why my explorer stopped working

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it was working fine inside docker

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what do you mean not working

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i started it again

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try to resync the chain

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i did

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
started from zero

[16-Dec-18 03:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
seemed explorer was crash

[16-Dec-18 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the conf file needs certain things BEFORE you start the sync

[16-Dec-18 03:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[16-Dec-18 03:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the explorer is in docker and the conf file seems to be fine

[16-Dec-18 03:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have restarted the explorer from zero blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  its still notarizing the blocks in between

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
conf needs all that

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is that fine ?

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes got all that ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Dec-18 03:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm no idea about explorer then

[16-Dec-18 03:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
dont know why its crashed before

[16-Dec-18 03:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have to ask someone who knows

[16-Dec-18 03:26 PM] D.rabbani#9094
may be staking wasnt started

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  its still finding the notarized blocks in between is that normal?

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
noarisations are just a transaction inside a block

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but its mining fine

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its slow

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but its good till now

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
an hour has been passed

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what chain is this ?

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if you dont mind me asking?

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] D.rabbani#9094
DION

[16-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thats supposed to be 100% PoS ?

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean its mining smooth

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it is 100% POS

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the mining is smooth

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
at the moment

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
let me check the explorer

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```Is there an easy way to consolidate this utxo dust?
I'm seeing this:

DION total utxos:       9118
DION notarisation utxos:        29


I'd quite like to consolidate those 9118 utxos so that they are not more than 200 perhaps but is there a pragmatic way to solve this instead of having to randomly pick a number and send those assetchain coins to myself.
```

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we have a problem man

[16-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ˜®

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  hope its not related to me ðŸ˜®

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ðŸ˜„

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its your chain

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
100% PoS

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and a notary node has 9000+ utxo

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he didnt buy them off you I bet

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so will it explode ?

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ðŸ˜®

[16-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
how in the hell has he managed to mine blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
omg ðŸ˜¦

[16-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im not sure it will explode but someone else has been generating blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no

[16-Dec-18 03:30 PM] D.rabbani#9094
