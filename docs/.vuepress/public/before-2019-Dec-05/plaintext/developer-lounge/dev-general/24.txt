try something like that, if you haven't

[14-Sep-18 11:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have dealt with this stuff too, sometimes making JSON and your shell happy is very painful on the eyes

[14-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto why does zcash and btc have these examples if they're wrong

[14-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
or is there something different in komodo that makes them wrong for komodo exclusively

[14-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
this is the 4th one we've come across that is flat out wrong

[14-Sep-18 11:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
Zcash inherited docs from BTC 0.11, KMD inherited those, it's possible stuff has changed and docs never updated

[14-Sep-18 11:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
just normal "docs don't get updated and the code changed" kind of thing

[14-Sep-18 11:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
which things have the docs bene actually wrong about?

[14-Sep-18 11:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you don't run tests every commit to make sure something works a certain way, it has a habit of breaking or changing

[14-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Alright#0419

[14-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Alright#0419
syntax was wrong

[14-Sep-18 11:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
is it wrong in Zcash as well?

[14-Sep-18 11:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
i remember having to brute force how z_sendmany worked when first using it, the docs were hard to read

[14-Sep-18 11:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have tried that one before, but here it is again for good measure.

```

[14-Sep-18 11:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Anyway, no worries. I'll put a note in here and we can come back to it later.

[14-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
wrong in zcash

[14-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
that example is straight from zcash and possibly btc

[14-Sep-18 11:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh, that is `sendmany`

[14-Sep-18 11:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
not `z_sendmany`

[14-Sep-18 11:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't think i have ever used `sendmany`, yeah the docs were probably wrong 😃

[14-Sep-18 11:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have often gone and read C++ code to figure out how to use an RPC, versus trying to rely on the docs

{Reactions}
abusedsmily 

[14-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hopefully we'll be able to change that. :)

Since we're a developers platform, I'm really hoping to make it as simple as possible to figure out how everything works. 

Anyway, on tot he next section. 

Thank you for the help.

[14-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
can you make your notes public

[14-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
I have some things I could add

[14-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The notes are in the doc itself.

[14-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Alright#0419
if I make a google spreadsheet with all the rpc commands, could we use it for notes any of us might have?

[14-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sure. 

Once I get through with the last section, `Wallet`, (which is a long one) I'll be working with Mylo to integrate all of this into the official komodo github.

[14-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We want to finish this first, though, so we don't get too far off track.

[14-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Alright#0419
for example, the "flags" value for kv help commands needs to be clarified or removed

[14-Sep-18 11:38 PM] Alright#0419
right now, it's a bit of an oversimplification that isn't entirely correct

[14-Sep-18 11:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think, since ongoing documentation efforts are going to be more important for us than they will be for Zcash, we're looking to create a more efficient way of tracking and updating everything.

[14-Sep-18 11:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We want to make each command modulate. So, yes, a spreadsheet, but moreso, we've also lightly discussed scripting a validator for each release, to make sure they all work, and also scripting so that the `help <command>` matches perfectly with `docs.komodoplatform.com`

[14-Sep-18 11:39 PM] Alright#0419
don't do all the work in your repo then add it all in a single commit. You're repo isn't an actual fork of the docs repo, so all the changes would have to be merged as a single commit i believe

[14-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, Mylo and I discussed this yesterday. 

For now, since I'm well over halfway done with this run through, we're just going to finish it out and then come back around with a new method.

[14-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I commit usually a few times a day.

[14-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think.

[14-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Alright#0419
you're making it harder on anyone else that wants to work on it in the future IMO

[14-Sep-18 11:40 PM] Alright#0419
git is useful if you use it correctly

[14-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes.

We're not leaving it in the current method.

[14-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
Maybe I'm wrong, but are you able to do a PR from your repo to the official docs repo?

[14-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
I think you can't atm because your repo isn't actually a fork of that repo

[14-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
you recreated it from scratch

[14-Sep-18 11:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Goal right now: Upate all the sentences, text, and examples.

next goal: integrate into a more efficient git/modular/scripting system

[14-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Alright#0419
all the commit history won't be in the official repo if you wait until you're done then fork it and commit all the changes at once

[14-Sep-18 11:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, it would be better if each commit were there, I agree.

[14-Sep-18 11:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We can fix this soon. Many things need fixing. 

We were intending on getting to this problem early next week.

[15-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can anyone see what I'm doing wrong here?

```
./komodo-cli addmultisigaddress 2 '["RSWwtqsNr9mW21UXRm6Lz4AzQnj4pVzzkp","RW8d8EChHTooVbwF3reqHYgkzWCnJFLXgh"]'
error code: -1
error message:
no full public key for address RSWwtqsNr9mW21UXRm6Lz4AzQnj4pVzzkp
```

[15-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, wait...

[15-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hang on

[15-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
forgot to add my regtest chain

[15-Sep-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and now it works

[15-Sep-18 01:54 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Do we need to document the `-exportdir` option described here?

```
backupwallet "destination"
--------------------------

The ``backupwallet`` method safely copies wallet.dat to the indicated file.

Arguments:

::

    "destination"   (string, required) the destination filename, saved in the directory set by -exportdir option
```

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
it's `dumpwallet`

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
oh no, those are two different things

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so I'll find it soon in the list

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thank you

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, it's separate then

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
backupwallet just copies the wallet.dat

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right

[15-Sep-18 01:55 AM] Alright#0419
dumpwallet dumps all the privkeys in it

[15-Sep-18 01:56 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm just noticing that `-exportdir` looks like a run time or `.conf` parameter, and we might need to document it?

[15-Sep-18 01:56 AM] Alright#0419
it is

[15-Sep-18 01:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what should I say about it? For example:

`-exportdir` is a runtime parameter that "insert description here"

[15-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
there are some others there

[15-Sep-18 01:58 AM] Alright#0419
there may be a better place for them, I just added them there because I was changing a zcash reference to komodo at the time

[15-Sep-18 02:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, yes, this is great.

[15-Sep-18 02:01 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It seems to me that all of these are part of the KMD coin daemon, and may/may not also be included in asset chains.

So, I think they should go in this list.

[15-Sep-18 04:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
asset chains are run-time forks of KMD, so any CLI args that komodod has, so does an asset chain

[15-Sep-18 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
he's talking about things like `-donation=` and `-exchange=1`

[15-Sep-18 05:01 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto 

Yes, most of them are in KMD, but I feel like I've come across a few differences. I'd have to go back through and scan to see which differences these were.

I was just being careful to speak specifically.

Anyhow, I'm almost done with the basic KMD API commands list. Should be done probably sometime on Monday.

[15-Sep-18 05:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo I'm hopping on in meeting_one, if you wanna catch up via voice real quick.

[15-Sep-18 05:04 AM] Mylo#8306
@Alright @dukeleto   Yes sidd and i went through breaking up what he had started into separate tasks.   language + command api stuff.   Both have to come from `komodo-cli help` output otherwise maintaining both src _plus_ external manual edits is more than just cumbersome and sync-hell.

Spreadsheet is a good idea.   The CC testing spreadsheet for example has lots of useful 'future commits' for `komodo-cli help` output.

@gcharang has also found some markdown -> restructured test conversion.  whether they are useful or get in the way yet to be determined, but running 1.sh from https://github.com/imylomylo/mkdocs.sh creates all the markdown in that repo for the difference `komodo-cli help <COMMAND>` outputs.

documentation is extremely  important...thanks people

[15-Sep-18 08:23 AM] Mylo#8306
@ph03nix we're aiming for cloneable, customizable docs for assetchains to have their own set if they require. e.g. whitelable docs with a bit of search and replace.

[15-Sep-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
great idea

[15-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Under#7846
Hey @Team  Admin  I was wondering if you have seen algorand’s random selection methods, and would ever consider this as a system to fully decentrally elect notary nodes?

[15-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Under#7846
https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/377.pdf

[15-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Audo#5667
is that a way to just randomly select someone?

The notary nodes have an important task, so we have to make sure that their activity and good results are rewarded with re-election. If it would be all random then we would get some "bad" notary nodes that would neglect their responsibilities.

[15-Sep-18 02:19 PM] Under#7846
It’s a system that aims to ensure honest consensus via a random selection method. I found it to be a very interesting as it aims to create honest BA’s randomly each round.

[15-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Under#7846
Not just a pure random selection.

[15-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Under#7846
It’s worth a read at least. I really love the concept of notary nodes, the one downside is the parity issue between notary nodes and regular nodes.  If a consensus mechanism could be built that accomplishes this without two separate classes of nodes, then the decentralization of consensus is furthered.

[15-Sep-18 02:58 PM] Audo#5667
ok, sounds interesting. @Bryan_Beus I think you would be interested in that too

[15-Sep-18 04:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
Ugh, font so small I upgraded to 18.04.1 by mistake. Does that cause a problem for developing with Komodo? If so, it's not a big deal to reinstall

[15-Sep-18 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright you are right, in that some KMD CLI arguments only apply to KMD itself and not assetchains. good to make it clear in the docs

[15-Sep-18 07:41 PM] SHossain#0007
@CMaurice I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 and not facing any issues with Komodo or any other chain

[15-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus off of the top of my head, some differences are that kv only works on asset chains, jumblr only works on kmd

[15-Sep-18 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
the `-donation` and `-exchange` and `-notary` are KMD specific

[15-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
`-genproclimit=0` is specifically for ac_staked chains

[16-Sep-18 06:41 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Is there a simple file I can edit to change the output of komodo-cli help ?
theres a few args examples which are the same thing with different names
e.g. 
`setaccount "KMD_address" "account"`
` signmessage "KMD address" "message"` no underscore
` dumpprivkey "komodoaddress"` unabreviated
not sure why yet, but I'd like to make something which runs all cli commands for a given argType
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDBB help | grep '\[pubkey\]'`
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDBB help | grep '\[tokenid\]'`
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDBB help | grep '\"hash\"'   ###  Returns extras`
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDBB help | grep '\"hex\"'   ###  Returns extras`
ideally, the argTypes in helpfile are consistent, and not repeated in the sample return string
i.e. of the below, I want the first but not the second - 
`komodo-cli -ac_name=STAKEDBB help | grep '\"hex\"'`
decodescript "hex"
signrawtransaction "hexstring" ( [{"txid":"id","vout":n,"scriptPubKey":"hex","redeemScript":"hex"},...] ["privatekey1",...] sighashtype )

[16-Sep-18 06:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
If I can get it working, might be a way to identify which commands are active in any given  asset chain

[16-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus @Alright see msg ☝ where can such documentation bugs be logged?  Which github repo? 
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator that output comes straight out of src, maybe rpcserver.cpp or rpcXXXXXX.cpp

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Mylo#8306
So maybe on komodo repo and we tag it with _documentation_ - there will be heaps, eg all of sidds current iteration of work will end up as github issues imo

[16-Sep-18 12:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
thanks SHossain, I'll carry on, but considering moving to Debian as I have 18 yrs experience there, though I've used Ubuntu a bit, might that be a less wise move?

[16-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Mylo#8306
deb should be fine.  some notary nodes use debian

[16-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Mylo#8306
because we tend to use ubuntu more in general, some instructions say ubuntu
