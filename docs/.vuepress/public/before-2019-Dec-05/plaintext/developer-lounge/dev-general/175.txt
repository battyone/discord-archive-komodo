Yes I understand why it's doing that, but I now have to comment out that if each time I need to use z_sendmany on a test network

[20-May-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
why not add a special case for testnetwork==1 in z_sendmany? that seems more sane

[20-May-19 07:12 PM] Alright#0419
good idea, I'll try it

[20-May-19 07:27 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
@jl777c I have a good project that I hope that I can build on KMD can you recommend  a developer that I can speak with ?

[20-May-19 07:31 PM] jl777c#5810
you can DM me

[20-May-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i can see your DM, and am sending response

[20-May-19 08:07 PM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
@dukeleto  hello, can I DM you about a project ? Thanks

[21-May-19 01:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
@{RSM} Skywall sure 👍

[21-May-19 01:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright sounds like testnode=1 should ignore that THROW_IF_SYNCING, that is reasonable. I do similar things in various places for regtest mode

[21-May-19 01:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
and i hadn't heard of that, interesting

[21-May-19 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@dukeleto  its just regtest without using regtest..... so sets mining requires peers to false.... and nothing else.

@grewalsatinder is there/did u figure out a way to construct pirate privkeys purely in go? if not, is it possible to import & make use of zcash rust lib in go?

[21-May-19 07:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't tried yet. a month or so ago I was looking at making passphrase to address gen in go, was still at beginning understanding levels.

[21-May-19 07:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then took break, and now getting back to go code

look at the debug log, might have something about corrupted chain and be shutting itself down

[22-May-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
it's killing itself because it's already running?

[22-May-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
`komodo-cli stop`

[22-May-19 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
then do it again

[22-May-19 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not killing itself and it's not "already running"
when I run komodod through gdb, gdb stops catching after the init starts running
gdb thinks komodod exited
komodod keeps running as expected
I get this even with a fresh reboot and nothing else running

[22-May-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
all the libs are installed? it seems gdb cant find a libthread_db?

[22-May-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 komodo is multi-threaded

[22-May-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
so you need to use gdb to connect to the exact PID that you want to debug

[22-May-19 12:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
what you are seeing is gdb work correctly before komodod forks into various procs/threads

[22-May-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto so how do I get a trace when it crashes? bt return "no stack" or something like that

literally first link

[22-May-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
😉

[22-May-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can either connect after KMD starts normally, or there might be a way to connect to a child process too. gdb has a lot of features

[22-May-19 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
break that down for me like I'm 5 😛

[22-May-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326

[22-May-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
can't read docs for you 😉

[22-May-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
gdb + multithreaded = always look it up

[22-May-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
i don't remember, it's not intuitive, but the features are there, it's possible

[22-May-19 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't want to learn the inner-workings of gdb and become a gdb master, I just want to get a trace to give to someone that know wtf is breaking my daemon 😛

_says "screw it I'll just let the pool keep crashing and reboot it as needed, go do something useful, and let whatever bug is in komodod stand"_

[22-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 giving you shit, it completes me, you know that

[22-May-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 have you tried `thread N` for various values of N ?

[22-May-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need to drop into the numbered thread from gdb CLI

[22-May-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are all numbered, and also have names, but gdb refers to them by the order they forked in, i think

[22-May-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
`thread 0` or maybe `thread 2`, i think thread 1 is exiting normally, as alright said

[22-May-19 01:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
by default it sticks with one execution path of children, i assume

[22-May-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you have fork=> fork => fork, it just chooses 1 of the 8 children to follow

[22-May-19 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't even know how to find out what thread it is (or even how many) or when it started being threaded and stopped tracing like normal
I know fekall about gdb other than "Just gdb -args komodod... run... then get backtrace when it crashes" is how it "used to work"

[22-May-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 what is the current bug that is being debugged? I missed that part

[22-May-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, `backtrace all` gives a backtrace from all threads, good to know

[22-May-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It either crashes or locks up (seemingly when there's a large unclaimed rewards block)

[22-May-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, it might be that we want to set a breakpoint, so we can inspect what variables look like just before the crash

[22-May-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
you do that with `b FuncName`

[22-May-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, it sounds like the problem is not deterministic

[22-May-19 01:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that tells us something

[22-May-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that's the problem, without a trace, there's no indication (aside from my assumptions) as to where to even begin to look or start messing with breaks
even worse is that this 1 production node is the only one of 14 nodes that has an issue 😣

[22-May-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 any difference in OS, library version, git commit of kmd, anything to give us a data point of difference?

[22-May-19 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nope

[22-May-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 also, is there different amount of RAM or maybe failing ram?

[22-May-19 01:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
failing ram gives realllllly bad stuff

[22-May-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
do you ever get a `core` file ? might need `ulimit -c unlimited`

[22-May-19 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I thought ram, but even with new host have same issue (seems magically gremlined to only my pool)
ulimit is high because It randomly crashed last week with "too many open files" so I jumped that up
core file?
