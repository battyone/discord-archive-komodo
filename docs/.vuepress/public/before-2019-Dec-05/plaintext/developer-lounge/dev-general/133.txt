pretty confident it's op error on my side

don't think I'm going to even bother to try to debug it, just cut off anything after 8 decimals üòÇ

@webworker01 it works as it should with cli

jq was just so I didn't have to post massive tx

[13-Mar-19 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User it seems to be a bug in rpc library itself

[13-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not doing any math operations on the number. That is the initial number I'm getting from getrawtransaction rpc command

[13-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
solution is just use valueSats instead

This is the latest jl777 branch daemon running Komodo chain. the notaries seem to be the KMDLabs notories(I recognise my address and there are 19 of them). Is this intended?

[14-Mar-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that RPC only works for labs... If that is a problem I can do a PR right now that disables those RPC's for non LABS chains?

[14-Mar-19 06:06 AM] gcharang#6833
No not a problem. I was documenting new RPC calls, and thought this might work for KMD

[14-Mar-19 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah it might be able to .. but i'd have to change it.

[14-Mar-19 06:10 AM] gcharang#6833
So these two:
```
getnotarysendmany
getiguanajson
```
are only useful for KMDLabs right now? @blackjok3r

[14-Mar-19 06:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, the getiguana json will be being replaced I think aswell .

@Deleted User for the language CC bounties, clearly it needs to interpret the code that is in the opreturn, but to be useful it also needs to be able to access standard blockchain data, so built in functions around address balances, utxo status, txid, etc. it would be nice to be able to create a function with defined arguments and put it in a txid. then other functions could call a txid(arg0,arg1,...) where the parameters are fed into the code in the opreturn of the txid and of course to have symbolic names for the txid. once we can put in functions into txid, the 8kb limit wont be any issue

[15-Mar-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
for the bounty it needs to be a usable implementation

[15-Mar-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a simplified example CC in customcc.cpp (.h)

[15-Mar-19 11:28 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
hi, @mrlynch and I agreed he could work on the Vault-CC for a bounty from me. Just to be sure, it's not being worked by anyone else. right?

Bitcoin Vaults: How to Put an End to Bitcoin Theft
Bitcoin vaults have the potential to stop Bitcoin thefts from Bitcoin clients. This post answers some frequently asked questions about them.
http://hackingdistributed.com/images/2016-bitcoin/vault4.jpg

[15-Mar-19 11:34 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this is special address you can create, when you move coins out of it the tx isn't immediate but takes a long time, could be days, during that time you can cancel the outgoing tx using another key you setup when creating the vault address
and there's an option for yet another key, that can be used to burn the coins as tx fee
so when creating a vault address you must set the time required to unlock and the recovery key
I'm less sure if the burn key is a good idea, that could be optional

http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/MES16.pdf

[15-Mar-19 11:38 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the use case is to have a secure cold storage address, if the key is stolen you have plenty of time to notice and delete the thief action until he gives up (or you go nuclear and burn it all, praying a miner will recover it)

[15-Mar-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
send to paper wallet, mail paper wallet to yourself....
vaulted :troll:

[15-Mar-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems related to heir, but different

[15-Mar-19 11:50 AM] gcharang#6833
The burn key is like throwing the chess board when there are no options left to recover the funds, I have read that the option just being present will act as a deterrent to any would be hacker attempting to steal the regular priv keys.

But it must be handled with care, or else it becomes a hostage situation if an attacker gets access to the burn key üòÉ 

This is something between a hot wallet and cold wallet with optional institutions that can monitor the the address and alert any suspicious activity

[15-Mar-19 12:16 PM] dukeleto#7326

starting on that customCC thing today myself. Not sure exactly what im making, likey just a faucet or something similar to get how to do it first.

[16-Mar-19 05:30 AM] Mylo#8306
OK - i had a masterclass with james during the week.   Ask anything and i'll do my best.   I think I'll be publishing excerts from the masterclass but will need ot consult with pplz regarding it.
There are some helper functions that alleviate some of the code reading you'll have to do.

[16-Mar-19 05:32 AM] Mylo#8306
Granted i haven't done cpp for 15 years, but syntax is syntax.   customCC is brilliant though, looking at faucetCC makes (more) sense, i haven't had time to properly soak it up, so if you can ask questions today @Deleted User @blackjok3r be great to remove the barriers.

[16-Mar-19 06:31 AM] Mylo#8306
Actually better to wait til i type it up.   Be much clearer, you'll be able to follow (i promise) and there will be less confusion and questions.  Plus i'll be running the tutorial  by james for accuracy.

@gcharang  There is an undocumented option for getblocktemplate that is used by my speical pool for custom assetchains. Did you want me to tell you how to fetch it and what it does?

[16-Mar-19 06:54 AM] gcharang#6833
Yes @blackjok3r please

[16-Mar-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`\"mode\":\"disablecb\" `

[16-Mar-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one sec and I will get the exact command to pull it. There is nothing in help, as its not something a user would really ever use.. We should probably document it though incase someone wants to write a new pool one day.,

[16-Mar-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`komodo-cli getblocktemplate '{"mode":"disablecb"}'`
It returns a slightly diffrent JSON, where the `coinbase` key/value is removed, and instead the coinbase is added in the `transactions` field

[16-Mar-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This allows a pool to directly mine the coinbase created by the daemon.  This is especially useful for things like `ac_notarypay` and `ac_founders` etc... where the coinbase changes on almost every block.

[16-Mar-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This means that the pool can no longer take its fee in the coinbase transaction. However I wrote a custom pool that takes its fee in the payment processor instead.

[16-Mar-19 07:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I beleive you have been linked with that pool already. üòÉ

[16-Mar-19 07:06 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it @blackjok3r 
Let me summarise this:
- command: komodo-cli getblocktemplate '{"mode":"disablecb"}'
-  sets the mode: disablecb
- instead of a seperate coinbase txn, this mode adds it to the list of regular txns
- but doing so will missout in fees
- but the fees can be collected using custom code that is present in your pool : https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/knomp

kind of. I dont think that mode works at all with any other pool, as the RPC by the pool doesnt use it.

[16-Mar-19 07:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So to use that mode, you basically need my pool

[16-Mar-19 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
you're not actually "disabling" anything, but forcing the stratum to use the template as a literal rather than a suggestion

[16-Mar-19 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
it *enables* the pool to use the "special" tyes
