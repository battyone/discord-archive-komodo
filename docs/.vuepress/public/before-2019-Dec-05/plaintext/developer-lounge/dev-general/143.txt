mining pools have to run what the miners want, and miners can only mine tokens that they can sell to buy electricity.
Traders control it all.

[22-Mar-19 06:18 PM] jl777c#5810
change it all, then make new ones that have the old behavior

@zack you aren't the only one who doesn't agree with kmd's interpretation of what oracles are. I have had a similar discussion with others.  thx for  coming by to debate your point.

[22-Mar-19 06:19 PM] MyName#0491
`mining pools have to run what the miners want`
99% of miners can't install a wallet, much less determine what code they want

Amoveo miners never have to install a full node

I literally know hundreds of miners who have never had a node/wallet, full or otherwise

[22-Mar-19 06:21 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo is the only project trying to resuse Nakamoto consensus for the oracle.
It is a radical departure from existing oracle designs, and you are right to question whether it will work.

But if it does work, it will be vastly cheaper than the alternatives.

[22-Mar-19 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
so... "hard update"s?

[22-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i think users need more visibility to be able to choose which fork, otherwise there is no corrective force from users

[22-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but with money at stake, maybe that is the force

[22-Mar-19 06:22 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I dunno. I'm cranking a buttload of oracles for aout $5/month

[22-Mar-19 06:22 PM] zack#6467
the nash equilibrium is that we will never have to hard update to prevent an oracle from closing the wrong way.

[22-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the amoveo is more akin to bet CC than oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 06:23 PM] zack#6467
There has been some planning to add a feature to the full node, so that you could manually tell it to never download blocks that close a particular oracle in a way that you specify as lying.
I think it is a good idea, we should probably add this feature.

[22-Mar-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
to me, the oracles CC is just for the raw data to be onchain

[22-Mar-19 06:24 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Create one if you want, it's on me. You can even drop some product placement in it - http://oracle.earth/create_oracle/

[22-Mar-19 06:24 PM] zack#6467
if you don't have an oracle, then you wont be able to do trust free betting.

[22-Mar-19 06:25 PM] zack#6467
if the data source is trusted, the enforcement of the bet is trusted.

[22-Mar-19 06:25 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so only oracles can bet?

[22-Mar-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
bet CC would need to implement a layer using oracles data as the input

[22-Mar-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
any single publisher wont be trusted

[22-Mar-19 06:25 PM] MyName#0491
` that you specify as lying.`
so I get to force an oracle to fork the grass_is_blue chain and tie it up forever? this should be fun to play with üòà

[22-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
in aggregate data feeds from many publishers

[22-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also, it is possible to bet on things that no data publisher is publishing

[22-Mar-19 06:26 PM] zack#6467
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  an oracle in Amoveo is an on-chain data structure. it doesn't own money. it cannot bet.

[22-Mar-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is no data publisher incentivized to cheat as their incentive is to keep the data stream high quality

[22-Mar-19 06:26 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but `if you don't have an oracle, then you wont be able to do trust free betting.`?

[22-Mar-19 06:27 PM] zack#6467
aggregating data feeds cannot be a secure oracle.

[22-Mar-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
we have turing complete C code running inside the daemon. i claim that any sort of logic can be implemented

[22-Mar-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say aggregate

[22-Mar-19 06:27 PM] zack#6467
no amount of logic can combine data feeds into a secure oracle.
You at least need the data feeds to be commit-reveal, then it might be possible.

[22-Mar-19 06:28 PM] zack#6467
and you probably need to have the reporters have some vested interest. a bond or something.

[22-Mar-19 06:28 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so oracles cant bet. cant do  trust free betting if you dont have an oracle. So there is no trusted betting ?

[22-Mar-19 06:28 PM] Alright#0419
yep, devs deciding what is and isn't true

[22-Mar-19 06:28 PM] Alright#0419
that's what you need

[22-Mar-19 06:29 PM] MyName#0491
`and you probably need to have the reporters have some vested interest. a bond or something`
how is that not the opposite of trustless?

[22-Mar-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so they commit to the data, then when all commitments are there, all reveal and then do a correlation consensus

[22-Mar-19 06:29 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can we incorporate dilithuim so we can do schrodinger bets?

[22-Mar-19 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so no gaming your data based on other publishers

[22-Mar-19 06:29 PM] zack#6467
you need tires to drive a car, but you can't put a tire in the driver's seat and let him drive.
You need an oracle to do betting, but the oracle itself is not making any bets.

[22-Mar-19 06:30 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c  yeah, that is the basics of what Augur and Bitcoin Hivemind do. you can can look at the bitcoin hivemind docs for the details.

Personally, I think Amoveo's oracle will be much more successful of a design.

[22-Mar-19 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so what if there is a commit/reveal process for each data point and the datafees are given to the ones with the highest correlation to the others

[22-Mar-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
make the game theory so the data providers make the most money by having the most accurate data

[22-Mar-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but the total bet size is limited by the data fees....

[22-Mar-19 06:31 PM] zack#6467
yeah, that would be closer to a working solution. But I still recommend to read some other people's designs before building anything.

[22-Mar-19 06:32 PM] MyName#0491
`make the game theory so the data providers make the most money by having the most accurate data`
still leaves the sticky bits of determining "accurate"

[22-Mar-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe having a bug bounty system

[22-Mar-19 06:32 PM] zack#6467
There is a limit in Augur where the total amount of money being bet needs to be worth significantly less than the value of the votecoins staked in the oracles

[22-Mar-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
first reporter of bad data gets the most bounty and if it really is a valid bug, it overrides the data. the stake holders would vote on the validity of the bug report

[22-Mar-19 06:33 PM] zack#6467
it makes their design so expensive. they have to pay big fees to votecoin holders to keep the price high enough

[22-Mar-19 06:33 PM] jl777c#5810
by letting anybody gain bug bounty for bad data, it would make people run data gather/compare code to be the first to find any bad data

[22-Mar-19 06:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is it correct to say that betting on the outcome potentially affects the outcome?

[22-Mar-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I want to separate the betting from the raw data, so the provider of the raw data isnt directly determining anything. the bet would be on highly processed data that is validated by everyone

[22-Mar-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
or anyone

[22-Mar-19 06:35 PM] zack#6467
A lot of oracle mechanisms involve escalation mechanisms.
So if someone is trying to push bad data through, there is a way for honest people to lock up money in a deposit to mark that data as bad, and needing further review.

[22-Mar-19 06:35 PM] MyName#0491
`by letting anybody gain bug bounty for bad data, it would make people run data gather/compare code to be the first to find any bad data`
Why does that make me envision an entire new occupational field where people start trying to do that for a living?

[22-Mar-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
it would just mean running a node gathering the same data the publisher is posting and finding big enough discrepancies

[22-Mar-19 06:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@MyName  #kmdlabs

[22-Mar-19 06:37 PM] zack#6467
Oracles are a deep subject, it would probably take a long time to be able to build a new secure one, but copying or modifying an existing design would be faster.

[22-Mar-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, I understand, this is why there is no bet CC yet

[22-Mar-19 06:38 PM] MyName#0491
the problem I see with leaving it to gather/compare code is the whole blue/green grass scenario where by 97 sources saying grass is blue vs 2 saying grass is green would yield a result that "grass is green" is a "lie"

[22-Mar-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why stakeholders would need to approve any disputes

[22-Mar-19 06:39 PM] zack#6467
I would be honored if you grouped an Amoveo light node with one of your komodo chains, so that you could make bets who's outcome is determined by Amoveo's oracle.

[22-Mar-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we would just need to make an oracles CC that cross posted from the amoveo chain

{Reactions}
üòÑ 

[22-Mar-19 06:40 PM] zack#6467
that wouldn't be cryptoeconomically secure. you would be trusting someone.

[22-Mar-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but we can do it with merkleproofs

[22-Mar-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
to avoid trusting anyone

[22-Mar-19 06:40 PM] zack#6467
yes, Amoveo's data structure is fully merkelized, and the light node uses headers to verify the merkel proofs

[22-Mar-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so why wouldnt that work?

[22-Mar-19 06:41 PM] zack#6467
why wouldn't what work?

[22-Mar-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
"that wouldn't be cryptoeconomically secure. you would be trusting someone."

[22-Mar-19 06:41 PM] zack#6467
oh, the oracle CC module as specified is a trusted feed

[22-Mar-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
would need to query enough SPV servers to verify the merkle root can be used

[22-Mar-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
this is the purpose of the oracles CC, to get data that is otherwise inaccessible onchain, so the merkle proof can be put onchain and then the betCC can query SPV servers to validate the merkleproof

[22-Mar-19 06:42 PM] zack#6467
you should run the light node, so you can verify headers and know that the merkle root you are looking at is valid.

An attacker can spin up hundreds of fake spv nodes easily.

[22-Mar-19 06:42 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, light node then

[22-Mar-19 06:43 PM] zack#6467
if you run a light node, then you don't need the oracle CC. the light node will verify whatever merkel proof you need

[22-Mar-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of having the data offchain and ephemereal, the oracles CC would get it onchain so it is right there for other CC to access

[22-Mar-19 06:44 PM] zack#6467
so you want to re-write an amoveo light node on-chain on komodo? that is ambitious

[22-Mar-19 06:45 PM] zack#6467
just having each full node be required to also run an Amoveo light node is good enough

[22-Mar-19 06:45 PM] zack#6467
komodo has lots of chains, right? it is like a network of blockchains?

[22-Mar-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, many chains

[22-Mar-19 06:46 PM] zack#6467
so you can attach a light node to one of the chains, so every full node of that chain needs an amoveo light node

[22-Mar-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would be similar to our dual-daemon functionality

[22-Mar-19 06:47 PM] zack#6467
then you would have access to a very cheap oracle that is very likely to be secure

[22-Mar-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
how many oracles are active now on amoveo?

[22-Mar-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
typical day
