`the comments about checkpoints are very important` < that's the part where I do agree, if it is implemented (my reservations aren't with it in KMD as much as in the space)

BTC 0.18 running on a nintendo switch, didn't you say something about syncing a node on a nintendo recently @jl777c ?

[04-Jun-19 12:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD can probably run on a switch too

[04-Jun-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure about ARRR and doing joinsplits on that, tho

If anybody has tips/tricks for debugging a potentially dead Innosilicon A9 hashboard, I would love to hear them. A buddy is asking me for help, the board is marked as "Alive" but shows 0's for everything else. The other 2 hashboards are fine

[04-Jun-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright do you remember the max possible AC supply off the top of your head? I am searching for it but not finding it

[04-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto there is a new mechanism for larger ac_supply numbers

[04-Jun-19 04:15 PM] Alright#0419
it will mine it over 10 blocks instead of a single block if it's larger than 2B I think

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
10B

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] Alright#0419
don't know the exact details on it, but can get them if you need

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
max is 90 billion, in that case the first 90 blocks will get 1 billion

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if 10 or less, all at once

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the restriction is not more than 10 billion in any single transaction

[04-Jun-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
due to some very deeply hardcoded limits

[04-Jun-19 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
thanks, that is the detailed answer I needed

[04-Jun-19 04:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
some people are asking me if they can do a 20B supply on an AC and I knew that was close to edge cases

[04-Jun-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
they can, with the caveat that no tx can be for more than 10 billion

@pbca26 or @ca333 removed the releases at <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases> and that broke the hard links on the site, just keep checking back until they are fixed

@TonyL you are the homebrew master, I defer to you 😉

[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Varshini you might want to try `brew link gcc` or installing different versions OR trying in a new terminal, which might have some more environment variables set

[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
only some gcc versions work to compile KMD on Mac

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
additionally, build-mac hard codes the gcc version i believe

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Varshini#4460
@dukeleto i tried `brew link gcc` Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/gcc got

[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@blackjok3r @dukeleto 

I think we were talking about JavaScript a few months ago and about how you guys hate it. I think @jl777c concurred.

At the time, I spoke in defense of it.

I take that back now.

[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
and the only way is to patch the source of the build system, currently, if that gcc version doesn't work for you

[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
😄

[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Varshini what about `brew link gcc@8`

[06-Jun-19 04:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Varshini something sounds wrong. try to do `brew update` and `brew doctor` i think will diagnose problems

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
what have you done with homebrew recently?

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
which versions of which compilers did you install, and anything else that might help us help you?

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
By the way, come fall, I am starting a computer science combined bachelor's/master's degree program at my local university. Going to attend part-time, and still do tech docs at Komodo. 

The uni focuses on C++. I would also like to learn Lisp, though that would have to be in my (non-existent) freetime.

[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus congrats! If you learn to use Emacs, you will be forced to learn Lisp, just sayin' 👼

[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm so comfy with VIM nowadays. 

All this tech doc writing in vim has done wonders.

[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can't stand regular text editors now. Such the slow poke way.

@Deleted User how does pypi do the pip thing?   and yeah it can be any packaging system - some packaging systems probably need to be upgraded to pull from repo, build compare binaries etc. before actually publishing.

[06-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Mylo#8306
i installed `spacevim` on the weekend and eff me....useful...but has loads of stuff i don't know much about in pip world.

[06-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Mylo#8306

[06-Jun-19 02:24 PM] cipi#4502
you need to install the package `libdb++-dev`, which contains the file that is missing

[06-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Varshini#4460
@cipi  can you help me with the command

[06-Jun-19 02:39 PM] cipi#4502
in Debian/Ubuntu it is `sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev`

[06-Jun-19 02:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Varshini there should be an `apt-get` command in README.md to install all dependencies

[06-Jun-19 03:42 PM] Andy#1801
While what he wrote is obviously stupid, we do have to find a way to make that whole process better. Dependencies in js are a nightmare at the moment...

[06-Jun-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian do you think anon-ness had anything to do with this hack?

[06-Jun-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
I could very easily make up a fake personality that you would think is real, and do the same thing

[06-Jun-19 03:43 PM] jorian#4555
yes and that's the problem

[06-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jorian#4555
komodo shit the bed by not reviewing a new dev properly. he mentions that and now you want to brush it off with a meme

[06-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's about a lack of review of dependencies when versions change. A very boring thing

[06-Jun-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
All code in changed dependencies must be reviewed by a human.

[06-Jun-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
