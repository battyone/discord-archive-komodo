you guys should really get on that

[01-Feb-19 02:05 AM] smellycouch#3071
show them up and set your max reorg length to 9

[01-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
I think I can cause permanent chain splits on their network

you might need to set up a few nodes or MNs, but yeah

[01-Feb-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with hard coded max reorg limits it that it enables chain splits:
connect to vast majority if the nodes (MN in this case)
mine a competing chain, wait until it is 9 blocks reorg.
wait until the next block starts propagating (the instant it is reported and since you are connected to most all nodes, you will get this early) and then propagate your chain to half the nodes

[01-Feb-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
now half the nodes are on the original chain and half reorged 9 blocks, but all nodes are locked in and it seems must now be manually fixed?

[01-Feb-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
with BCH it has 10% the BTC hashrate, so it requires a lot of hashrate to reorg, plus this is a bit tricky to conduct and requires precise timing, so it wont work everytime.

[01-Feb-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is more than a nuisance attack as if there are exchange nodes in the half you reorged, it can all be done in the context of a double spend

[01-Feb-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and how will the network know something bad happened?

@cipi What is the procedure to add a new coin to `cipig/electrumx`?  Can you add if i share details?

[01-Feb-19 09:15 AM] niksmac#0421
do you need a PR? I have some doubts in variables like `TX_COUNT , TX_COUNT_HEIGHT , TX_PER_BLOCK , PEERS `

[01-Feb-19 09:16 AM] niksmac#0421
Where can i find the documentation for that?

[01-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I remeber those were just not required... put enything there you like... Its for estimation of how long is elft to sync or something./

zero knowledge tech getting better

[01-Feb-19 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
@niksmac i will add it for you... any specific NAME i should use? Or should i just use OUR as NAME and SHORTNAME?

[01-Feb-19 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
the TX_COUNT is not that important, i will use some small values, since it is a new chain and it doesn't have many blocks and transactions anyway.

[01-Feb-19 10:58 AM] cipi#4502
PEERS is only used for peer discovery, but i don't use that feature, i even disabled it completely on the electrums i manage.

@cipi shall I PM?

Hey in regards to the developer.komodoplatform pages, is there a way for us to incorporate these types of code blocks for our page? <https://developers.eos.io/eosio-nodeos/reference>
We had something similar back on the Siddhartha page, but when we moved it to developer.komodo we dropped it

[01-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Regnar#6164
Here's Tron developer portal <https://developers.tron.network/docs/tron-studio-intro> similar design, doesn't have the code blocks like EOS but still looks good.

[02-Feb-19 06:28 AM] Mylo#8306
hi @Regnar i have a response for you, just need to remove a link.

[02-Feb-19 06:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Thanks.
eos are api docs.  for v1 portal & docs remake, api docs like that are not planned.
marketmaker v1 has api docs like that by ca at http://api.kmd.host/
marketmaker v2 rustdocs i've got artem's instructions for building.  the promise by rust doc is to look like https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html

to make a multi-language api doc, we need multi-language libraries.   currently they are in various stages of development by community members, golang, rust, javascript, python, c++.

tron dev portal is the thing that i'm building, yes it will be nice and focussed, like <link removed>  but with updated content obv. which i'm working on atm.

All the above can be styled similarly at the end of the day.    IBN and doc team were going to be addressing some UX/style in feb.

Tech Tuesday Development Update - 2019 Week 3: Digital Asset Token...
Komodo Platform is starting a weekly briefing on the progress the Komodo Dev Team is making. It's called Tech Tuesday Update. Here's another update!
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg

[02-Feb-19 06:32 AM] Mylo#8306
can make a light theme, but dark has been chosen atm.

[02-Feb-19 06:44 AM] Mylo#8306
the current developers.komodoplatform site is built using vuepress.   and we've got some vue components to interact with blockchain from web browser to a docker container.   so i'd like to get some interactivity there with the developer with their own docker container and blockchain project.   that's the plan, i'll be testing any of this with these two repos before integrating any of that, because it may not pass the security audit.

_Only the owner of this repository can see this message. _

[02-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Mylo#8306
so the dependencies need a little update.

[02-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Mylo#8306
and if the team thinks it's too risky, this interactivity will need some re-work, remove some dependencies etc.

[02-Feb-19 06:53 AM] Mylo#8306
interactivity might remain in separate project for ppl to fork.  it's already forkable, just needs some instructions.

[02-Feb-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo if you want content for tech tuesday, you can mention that I am making good progress on SUQA+GIN getting DPoW

[03-Feb-19 12:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Now that kmdgo has all the core API set, and the most basic CC API of `faucet`, I set my own target to make a web app for `faucet`.
It is all just for my own learning purposes, and as I learn and make notes, I'l share those notes in form of tutorials as I progress.
That's my target 1 - To complete by 15th Feb, 2019.

My target 2 is to learn and create BTC/KMD addresses manually. Already progressing good on that understanding, thanks to 3 things:
- Old links that I have bookmarked from jl777
- btcdsuite/btcutils
- Mastering Bitcoin

If anyone watching kmdgo's repo, I borrowed 3+ package files of go form btcdsuite in it:
- btcec - secp256k1 package for go
- base58
- bech32
and some selected files from btcutils to `kmdutils`, which is part of `kmdgo` package.

Intention is to learn creating addresses, with go in all sorts of ways:
- Using package files - DONE
- Using manually process - In progress
- Wif to other Address types, like KMD Wif to BTC/ZEC address etc
- Agama Passphrase to multi-addresses

Setting my second target's finish date to 28th Feb, 2019

Once I hit my target 2, I'll create a series of tutorials with examples.

[03-Feb-19 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Nice progress and goals! @grewalsatinder 
Checked your repo - you have separate files for each RPC call.  
I don't know go much so probably it's a noob question: Isn't it possible to unify things as a universal object which sending call body with given arguments / receive JSONs abstracted of what call is it?
Like a in python I've took this module which actually consists of one file:
https://github.com/barjomet/slick-bitcoinrpc/blob/master/slickrpc/rpc.py
to interact with RPC creating a connection proxy object and it works with any calls which komodo / bitcoin / zcash or other bitcoin fork daemon supports

[03-Feb-19 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, as as I started I decided to just keep those separate intentionally. I only made this repo with the intention of learning Go language.
It is possible to unify each of them in their own files.

[03-Feb-19 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not a big task, can do.

[03-Feb-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also cleaned kmdgo repo recently for documentation

[03-Feb-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
earlier I was using C/C++ type of license comment at top which was all over the godoc documentation

[03-Feb-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now it's cleaned, and I can better document the code within the package files

I see, I just compared popularity of bitcoin libs of these languages üòÉ

[03-Feb-19 01:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with kmdgo the dev won't need to manually input any details like RPC User/Password/Port, only the project's name.
Example:
`komodo`
`VRSC`
`PIRATE`
etc

[03-Feb-19 01:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it will pick all those details from .conf files

[03-Feb-19 01:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

So I take my dpow python tests, which work on KMD, all asset chains, HUSH and GIN (so far that I have tested) and bring them into a new dpow coin, SUQA. I run the tests. And guess what these btc core fascists have done now.... `AssertionError: Some tests are not following naming convention!`

[03-Feb-19 10:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
making my test fail because it doesn't follow their naming rules

[03-Feb-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's only in BTC 0.17 codebases, they change a huge amount with tests. Most of it good, but not this

[03-Feb-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, they use python 3 now

[03-Feb-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
`TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation`

[03-Feb-19 11:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
and python 3 means every `print foo` needs to become a `print(foo)` along with a few other changes, along with test file api changes

they don't care or consider anybody else in the world a downstream, but perish the thought of doing something not backward compatible on the BTC chain. It's just plain elitism

[03-Feb-19 11:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thank god komodo isn't based on btc directly and we don't have to deal with it so much

[03-Feb-19 11:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Although the thinks labs has been doing break most things aswell lol, we have custom stratum, custom explorers custom rpcs hah

[03-Feb-19 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
adding new custom stuff is different than breaking long-standing existing things
