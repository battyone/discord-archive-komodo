so if you buy 10 ASICs don't run them on Pril all at once because you will be deemed a fraud 🤦🏽

[06-Dec-18 02:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
"PirlGuard System
With the PirlGuard Protocol deployed the chances of an attack succeeding are vastly reduced. As we know once the attacker has created a longer chain through privately mining a separate chain they will then have to broadcast it to the network. Once the attacker opens their node for peering it will attempt to peer with rest of the nodes on the network, telling them that they are wrong. However, once this happens PirlGuard will drop the peer and penalize them by sentencing them to mine X amount of penalty blocks due to their un-peered mining. The amount of penalty blocks assigned depends on the amount of blocks that the malicious miner mined in private."  Couldnt you just have peers on the private chain network, circumventing all of this?   Or even more maliciously,  have pirlguard block out legitimate miners as they wouldnt have been peers in the attackers version of pirl

[06-Dec-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah good point.... running a noe isnt that expaensive ... so just fire up 150 cheap AWS instances ... then broadcast your chain with those

LOKI coin is doing some kind of 51% protection, I skimmed this but I actually can't understand 90% of it, maybe because of XMR/CN jargon: https://github.com/loki-project/loki-improvement-protocols/blob/master/LIPS/LIP-3.md

they involve masternodes, since that coin seems to be mostly "XMR + masternodes"

[06-Dec-18 05:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
`Any block deeper than 12 blocks in the chain that has more than three checkpoints should then be considered final and cannot be reorganised.`

[06-Dec-18 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD DPoW seems better, but what do I know

[06-Dec-18 05:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Depenends ... dPoW requires the TX to be confirmed before the checkpoint is active ... so miners can refuse to mine notarisation txs as genie pointed out this morning ... but however making all miners do this seems difficult.

[06-Dec-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
pirlguard would seem to have a hard time achieving consensus when the network splits. how can they assure the exact same penalty is given for offchain violations of mining too fast? it seems if the attacker released a different amount of blocks to different peers, wouldn they all end up requiring different amount of penalty? and wouldnt that permanently fork the chain?

[06-Dec-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
be carefuly when you roll your own encryption or security protocol. it is a lot harder than it sounds and takes years of field testing to get it working properly.

[06-Dec-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW isnt perfect, but it is practical and field tested

[06-Dec-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the loki has some good points that BCH ABC should pay attention to:
The other, more naive approach is to simply cap reorganisations greater than P blocks. However there are serious problems with this approach, if an attacker can produce a chain of length P+1 and submit it to a different edge of the network as the non attacking chain is being checkpointed, then the network will diverge and will be unable to merge back into a single chain, effectively permanently forking the chain. This attack could, for example, deliberately target an exchange to put the exchange on a fork controlled by the attacker but distinct from the main network until manual maintenance is undertaken by the exchange to re-sync to the proper network chain.

[06-Dec-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
I believe ZEN also adopted something based on reorg limits, though a pretty large amount.

[06-Dec-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
loki has masternodes, which they use to create something similar to single chain notarization, but not to any higher hashrate chain. so, not bad but the masternodes are then open to being attacked without having a reference from a higher hashrate chain

it could just be you got connected to a couple of bad peers

[07-Dec-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and simply restarting the daemon when it gets bad is enough

[07-Dec-18 10:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I synced KMD once with it hapening and ended up banning all but only 2 peers

and then selectively choose who can see what?

[07-Dec-18 03:27 PM] all2#1432
Yes, simply. Assume you are managing a local government, you initiate a donation or public project, and  people/citizens want to see how you are using, spending money they gave you.  So you  register your company/organization here, then create a public account (BTC, KMD, any currency) in this ?bank... Then people (are also members)  can send money to that account (say donations),  and they can also  see transactions of this account. etc. Identities, Accounts and transactions are by default public, but can be made private(when creating).  ...

[07-Dec-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810

if you created a testchain, you can remove it

[07-Dec-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes have to remove an assetchain for it to truly die

[07-Dec-18 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you run it on only 2 nodes, that means doing it on two nodes
