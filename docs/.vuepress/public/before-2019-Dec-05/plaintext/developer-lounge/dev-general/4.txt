woooo boy https://dexstats.info/snapshots/BTCH_snapshot.json is a big JSON file, don't be downloading that all the time in a frontend JS code üòÉ

[22-Jul-18 03:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX in the json you will find a block height, and also number of utxos on the chain. those might be useful stats on your web frontend

[22-Jul-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i see that BTCH is not in your UI, because the json it produces is so large most likely. I can make it so `getsnapshot 500` only returns the top 500 in the richlist, and then you can add BTCH to dexstats richlists. Sound good?

[22-Jul-18 03:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
Hi @dukeleto
That would be a great idea can you make it getsnapshot n where n is a integer? Yes the btch snapshot is about 600mb I did not load it yet to the db because of the size. I will enrich it with the height and timestamp later.

hello Komodo team. We are in the process of building an orderbook exchange for the Indian Market and would like to list KMD. Could someone here guide us as to what would be the most efficient option to manage only user send and receives? Ideally, we would like to run a simple litewallet, if not available we will set up a full node.  KMD has several repositories on Git so, not really sure which option would be the best for us.  

Cheers!

yes, we're going for a full node with KMD> we want to eventually extend our services into wallet services like BitGo for a select few of the currencies we will be listing. KMD is one of the few so, full node it is.

@blackjok3r it seems like a silly C++ cast that is not supported in older compilers or something

noob cpp question because it's been 15+ years since i touched it -  as i look at some of the skeleton code getting added.
Q: how does rpcserver.cpp (with include rpcserver.h) know where rpcwallet.cpp is, i can't find includes by grepping.

I just want to make a skeleton RPC call that responds hello as first step.

@Mylo the build system (makefiles /etc) include them all into a few binaries like komodod, komodo-cli, komodo-tx etc

[26-Jul-18 05:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo if you just want to add a new RPC, it's pretty easy, just add your function and list the name of it in the correct place

[26-Jul-18 05:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can grep for `getsnapshot` to see how it works, it's simple in that it does not take a complex datastructure as an argument, just one optional integer

[26-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks mate, yeah i figured i could just follow the pattern - was just curious how rpc*.cpp files got known about.  cool will do üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 05:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX that PR above should make it simple to get BTCH data on your site, you can just limit BTCH to something reasonable like `getsnapshot 1000`

nice thanks a lot! I will run it as soon as it's merged

[26-Jul-18 05:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
PROTIP for `getsnapshot`: `reindex` doesn't quite work so nice, you need to blow away your blocks/chainstate/database junk and have addressindex from the beginning

[26-Jul-18 05:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
trying to add addressindex to an already existing node and trying `reindex`, it's not a Good Thing as Martha would say

[26-Jul-18 05:51 AM] C0K0#6498
hi

[26-Jul-18 05:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
adding or removing any addressindex/timestampindex/etc, blow everything way

[26-Jul-18 05:51 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes I always resynched from scratch takes a while but it's cleaner

[26-Jul-18 05:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am not sure if that is a bug with just the bitcore stuff merged to KMD or in the original stuff

[26-Jul-18 05:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
but there are many bugs. For instance, you can only iterate backwards, not forwards, for no good or documented reason

[26-Jul-18 05:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
it works, that is good enough for me, for now üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 05:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
bugs in how you talk to LevelDB, that is. LevelDB is some crazy shit

[26-Jul-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LevelDB is the bottleneck in the wallet code.

[26-Jul-18 05:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX using that top argument won't make anything faster or take less RAM, fyi. But it makes your return JSON structure reasonable üòÉ

[26-Jul-18 05:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If there was a way to replace it with something better that would solve unlimited problems with almost all blockchains.

[26-Jul-18 05:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
it still must parse + sort the entire utxo dataset to sort, and then return the top N

[26-Jul-18 05:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
who thought LevelDB was a good idea? Either I am really dumb or really smart, because LevelDB just doesn't seem like a great idea to me. The interface to talk to it is painful

[26-Jul-18 05:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
BTC core seems married to it

[26-Jul-18 05:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes thanks it still has to load the snapshot and than returns the first N

[26-Jul-18 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
hopefully it is useful
