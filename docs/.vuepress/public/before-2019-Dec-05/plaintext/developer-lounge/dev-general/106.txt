and I think build-mac.sh in KMD is broke, which makes me 😿

[23-Jan-19 01:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
not broke, but not compatible with my compiler anymore, maybe from a zec/vrsc merge

[23-Jan-19 01:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
i need to do a test on a clean repo from scratch, since `make clean` cannot be trusted

[23-Jan-19 01:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is with no CC env var and after a make clean, `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j4`

if anybody else can verify that build-mac.sh works on their os x machine, that would be a useful data point

[23-Jan-19 01:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am testing on my slightly out-of-date branch from `jl777` branch

[23-Jan-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto I think you can expect jl777 branch to have build problems for at least a couple days

[23-Jan-19 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
any other branch shouldn't

[23-Jan-19 03:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think a few `make clean`s fixed the problem. i know that the latest jl777 cclib stuff hasn't been tested much on mac/win, last I heard

@SHossain build problem with osx

[23-Jan-19 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looking at it, it really isn't a build problem that gcc-5 fails a gcc-6 check

[23-Jan-19 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
interesting unfun fact:
on OSX, if you delete a dir that is open in terminal, recreate that dir, and attempt to run something in the dir then terminal will run from the `.Trash` version of the dir
you have to cd out and back or open a new teminal to use the new dir 😣

[23-Jan-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
unix too. the location that was opened is the location the terminal will be in, until changed.

[23-Jan-19 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 which branch?

[23-Jan-19 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
debian usually gives a not found err, never follows to trash on its own

[23-Jan-19 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain jl777 branch of jl777 repo, but the need to update to 6 is documented in the readme (so the 5 not being 6 issue is on me for not reading)

[23-Jan-19 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
you need gcc6

[23-Jan-19 11:39 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, using 5 would be problemetic

[23-Jan-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, I didn't give any thought to if compiler might be "old" in Mohave

[23-Jan-19 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
i have another issue on my mac with libcurl. i somehow installed a version that doesn't work properly to compile Komodo. Decker found a fix for me is to remove libcurl mention from packages.mk file

[23-Jan-19 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's the 1st time I've tried to build komodo on that thing in well over 6 months, so I'm not sure what all is going to go wrong 😛

[23-Jan-19 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@SHossain I installed gcc6 (twice), is there something "special" I need to do to get it to recognize that it's now got 6 and not 5? 😕

[23-Jan-19 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
did you remove gcc5?

[23-Jan-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm guessing "no" 🤷🏽

[23-Jan-19 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
please try removing that

[23-Jan-19 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`brew remove gcc@5` ?

[23-Jan-19 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[23-Jan-19 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
or just `brew remove gcc5`

[23-Jan-19 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what's the mac equivalent of `make clean`?

[23-Jan-19 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```ComputerGenieDevMac:komodo computergenie$ make clean
make: *** No rule to make target `clean'.  Stop.```

[23-Jan-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
remove current source dir and clone fresh

[23-Jan-19 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
did you make changes to source?

[23-Jan-19 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Jan-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, only thing I did was clone and run the build script

[23-Jan-19 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
install the deps again perhaps one by one

[23-Jan-19 12:00 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me also try to build a fresh clone

[23-Jan-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, this could take a while
some idiot decided to run `brew upgrade` 😛

[23-Jan-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess we'll see if it works with gcc8.2 LOL

[23-Jan-19 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i actually ran into a different issue.

[23-Jan-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 in theory, you should be able to have multiple compilers installed and use `CC=foo ./zcutil/build.sh` to pick a compiler

[23-Jan-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
in practice, switching between branches and compilers with partial compiles is .... not recommended for sanity 😃

[23-Jan-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Jan-19 12:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
wisdom

[23-Jan-19 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so....
```
brew update && brew reinstall gcc@6
brew upgrade                        (not sure if "needed")
xcode-select --install                        (not sure if "needed")
manual edit of if in packages.mk file.     (needed)
./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8```
= 
```$ src/komodod
dyld: malformed mach-o image: dylib load command #7 string extends beyond end of load command
Abort trap: 6```

[23-Jan-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it could easily be that the new cclib.so is not working with osx yet

[23-Jan-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
if anything is hardcoded to ".so" it will need to be ".dylib" and a few other changes

[23-Jan-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it could easily be that the new cclib.so is not working with osx yet`
seems so; master branch builds and runs as expected on same rig

[23-Jan-19 04:22 PM] SHossain#0007
my macOS build worked fine from jl777 branch with new cclib

[23-Jan-19 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_adds it to the list of things that work for everyone **but** him_

[23-Jan-19 04:24 PM] SHossain#0007
did you use `build.sh` or `build-mac.sh` ?

[23-Jan-19 04:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`

[23-Jan-19 04:26 PM] SHossain#0007
it is indeed strange

[23-Jan-19 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i have only working knowledge on macOS

[23-Jan-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[23-Jan-19 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
mine only gets used for any testing. otherwise, i'm always on the other computer using Linux

[23-Jan-19 04:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I did use it to view a pool web page and verify that IE still sucks ass, so that has to count for something

[23-Jan-19 05:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to add more oddity, jl777 branch built and ran fine for me *after* I built master 😖

[23-Jan-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it bootstrapped itself

[23-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
like a C compiler that doesnt know about some new syntax, written in C without the new syntax

[23-Jan-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
then you compile it and now the compiler knows the new syntax and can be built using source code using the new syntax

[23-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Justaguy#6181
I have an asset chain currently running. I created an installer that automatically installs komodo onto a computer, because I wanna get a couple friends connected to my chain with their own computers so we can send my coins back and forth to eachother and I plan to make a prototype wallet for the coins. To connect additional computers, would it just be the same command: ./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 -addnode=<IP address of the first node> ?

[23-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Justaguy#6181
its just a simple test chain that im going to learn on

[23-Jan-19 08:39 PM] SHossain#0007
use public IP for the `addnode` param. any node can be connected to the network using that

[23-Jan-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007
everyone just have to use the same command with same ip preferrably. if there are more node with public ip, you can use that too. but, having one works fine

[23-Jan-19 08:41 PM] SHossain#0007

@dukeleto 

I'm going through your updates to the Komodo manual right now, adding them to dev documentation.

I'm working on `z_listunspent`. We currently have no entry for this call.

I'm trying to use a regtest chain to generate an example command, but I'm doing something wrong, and I'm not sure what. There's some sapling/regtest-related output that has me a bit confused.

Take a look:

```
sidd@sidd:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLO z_sendmany "RVkGrs5v3so3aSk92vhAPtUEJR2Uj5QGuh" '[{"address":"zregtestsapling1hz9tnmz0w4zz94u8pa26na8r0drfd3dpavk078wpky365c5n7u9jta0xhum5hnkg7vyzvz7zs40","amount":1000}]'
error code: -8
error message:
Invalid parameter, unknown address format: zregtestsapling1hz9tnmz0w4zz94u8pa26na8r0drfd3dpavk078wpky365c5n7u9jta0xhum5hnkg7vyzvz7zs40
```

[24-Jan-19 11:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I got the z addr using `z_getnewaddress`

[24-Jan-19 11:31 PM] SHossain#0007
sapling z address starts with `zs` not sure about regtestmode

[24-Jan-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
why don't you use BEER or PIZZA instead of creating a new chain and using regtest mode?

[24-Jan-19 11:32 PM] SHossain#0007
or any other existing chain

[24-Jan-19 11:33 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_sendmany RGHitvk13noGDZfHDKacnThMRqJbBmS9cC "[{\"address\": \"zs1ya2k2wwkhz8xvf6069z6utjnxt50nemz2g9uxu30xp58yfmnjl6dpds0td6ufkfx09kyu3vxs04\",\"amount\": 25000}]"`
this one should work

[24-Jan-19 11:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus ^^

[24-Jan-19 11:37 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to use regtest mode specifically, dukeleto or Mylo can help

[24-Jan-19 11:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok.

I'm trying to add a few examples to the documentation, and regtest is the way i normally do this.

[24-Jan-19 11:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I suppose I can use BEER or PIZZA, I would just need to get them synced and get some.

I'm assuming there's a faucet.

[24-Jan-19 11:39 PM] SHossain#0007
i can send you BEER if you need that for testing. there are also faucets available in atomicexplorer.com for them

[24-Jan-19 11:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

[25-Jan-19 12:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Can you please send some BEER to this address?

RSyFypfyfVVn6EhXnsVPafEeepCzJ6pF3H

I've tried using the faucet, but it's getting hung up on the recaptcha

[25-Jan-19 12:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
By chance, can anyone see what's wrong with this curl command?
```
curl --user userXX:passXXXX --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method":"z_listunspent", "params": [1 100 false "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\"]" }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8923
```

[25-Jan-19 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think it might have something to do with the fact that this is happening on the BEER test chain, rather than a regtest chain

[25-Jan-19 01:30 AM] Mylo#8306
syncing BEER, will test once i find my wallet with BEER in it

[25-Jan-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
if someone can send 1 BEER or 0.25 BEER to `RPjCkVQoovRZgQxKZS585o5v8dh4PaxCuT`  that would be handy.

[25-Jan-19 01:42 AM] Mylo#8306
cannot find wallet which had 15 BEER in it.  maybe it's lost forever.
