Is https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/barterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category the most up-to-date documentation for the RPC API?

I think those are different APIs than the BarterDEX API.

[19-Nov-18 07:05 PM] wbradt#2043
The second one links to https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/barterDEX-API.html, which I think, but am not sure if, is the same as what I linked @webworker01

[19-Nov-18 07:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@wbradt which api in particular are you interested in?

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
webworker linked to the core KMD daemon RPC API

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
the other, is a higher level, BarterDEX API. That is an application level API, which is RPC based

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
barterdex API uses the KMD RPC API, underneath

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
as well as talks to many other coin daemon RPC APIs

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] wbradt#2043
Yes. BarterDEX API is what I am interested in

[19-Nov-18 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
hope that clears it up

[19-Nov-18 07:07 PM] wbradt#2043
Is what I linked the most up-to-date documentation of it?

[19-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
barterdex API docs have not been kept super-up-date, your link was last updated in Jun, which is maybe the latest, but also probably a bit out of date

[19-Nov-18 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is now a HyperDEX which uses the barterdex API underneath, but maybe has it's own API. @lukechilds knows more about hyperdex I believe

[19-Nov-18 07:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@wbradt what is your end goal, what are you trying to accomplish?

[19-Nov-18 07:11 PM] wbradt#2043
I am trying to write a simple marketmaker for BarterDEX/ learn about DEXes and would like some more info on what some of the endpoints do

[19-Nov-18 07:14 PM] wbradt#2043
@dukeleto ^

[19-Nov-18 07:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@wbradt #dev-tradebots is where core dev of barterdex-ish things happen, and @cipi is one of our resident barterdex experts (he runs all the electrum server backends that allows Agama to use light wallet mode on various  coins)

[19-Nov-18 07:19 PM] wbradt#2043
Thank you @dukeleto

@Decker Since I can't totally ever wrap my head around buffers...
Is there a reason that equihash/znomp changes to the txCount fix you used from znomp *from* this:
https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool/blob/master/lib/util.js#L75-96
In other words, would the original NOMP tx count code work? or would it stuff up the same at 128?

Latest Bitcoin ABC disallows reorgs greater than 10, it's amazing they think this is a good idea at all: https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc/releases/tag/v0.18.5

O.O

[21-Nov-18 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
you can't be serious

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright can you imagine

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
they are literally being made fun of on Twitter by BTC devs, and it's hard not to join in

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
Ah ffs, I had a lot of respect for ABC devs up until now

[21-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
it's not a consensus rule

[21-Nov-18 08:02 AM] Alright#0419
but basically what they're implementing is allowing nodes to choose which is the "correct" chain regardless of pow

[21-Nov-18 08:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
"if it has 10 confirms it's legit"

[21-Nov-18 08:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a dangerous default to give users

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
and it's simple to use NiceHash to break the chain

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
wait a day

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
and do it

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
split their network between updated and non-updated

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't get involved in BCH wars

[21-Nov-18 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
then see how fast they remove it or make it mandatory consensus rule

they are literally saying it's a feature

[21-Nov-18 08:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
to require human intervention

[21-Nov-18 08:04 AM] Alright#0419
they just threw the concept of pow out the window

@peterktodd @verretor I think it is reasonable for a minority chain to give more control to a user.
Make it less automatic and rely on human consensus in case of an attack.
At least, this is the kind of a design I've been developing back in 2012.

I think in a situations w...
Twitter

[21-Nov-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's astonishing to choose this situation, given that DPoW exists

[21-Nov-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
if DPoW didn't exist, sure, eat sand

[21-Nov-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
but we have a nice meal cooked

[21-Nov-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
and they are eating sand in the gutter

[21-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
inb4 they split again because of this

[21-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
calling it now

[21-Nov-18 08:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
Maybe some BCH people can be talked off their ledge and see the light of DPoW

[21-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
all it takes is for one influential person to say "this shorter chain is the *real* chain"

[21-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Alright#0419
split

[21-Nov-18 08:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
or a network split, or everybody upgrading at once

[21-Nov-18 08:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
or 99 other things

[21-Nov-18 08:07 AM] Alright#0419
I honestly don't think it would have much effect other than adding to political drama

[21-Nov-18 08:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
one of these BCH splits, will hopefully realize DPoW can save them from the rough world they were born into

[21-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
Oh man, they just opened themselves up to more attack vectors from SV

[21-Nov-18 08:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
BCH XYZ SV2 or whatever they call themselves

[21-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
if I were SV, I'd be doing it right now

[21-Nov-18 08:08 AM] Alright#0419
splitting their chain into many many pieces

[21-Nov-18 08:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
I remember thinking BCH splitting from BTC was a mess, such simpler times back then

[21-Nov-18 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
if there is a disagreement about real chain clout will decide the real chain

[21-Nov-18 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
not pow

[21-Nov-18 08:09 AM] Alright#0419
that is the underlying problem with it

[21-Nov-18 08:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, that is what people are also saying. It throws PoW out the window

[21-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Alright#0419
it hurts to even suggest this but...

[21-Nov-18 08:12 AM] Alright#0419
is SV now most similar chain to pre-segwit BTC

[21-Nov-18 08:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
that's rough

i can reclone, but that just irks me. Something funky is going on

[21-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
use jl777 branch unless you're trying to test stuff from Mike's merge

[21-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Alright#0419
also just try running build script again

[21-Nov-18 08:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems FSM is from the future

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright i am trying to submit new CC error checking code to FSM branch, which is where jl777 wants it

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
Mike merged a lot of new things

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
most CC functionality is broken in FSM as far as I know

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] Alright#0419
was a couple hours ago at least

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright yeah, i did `git clean -fdx; make clean; zcutil/build.sh` and still no bueno

[21-Nov-18 08:17 AM] dukeleto#7326

[21-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
along with verushash and veruspos

[21-Nov-18 08:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
but also, we are inheriting weird compiler shit from Verus

[21-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Alright#0419
now have an option for people who disagree with ASICs

[21-Nov-18 08:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am very excited about that, new coins can use verushash

[21-Nov-18 08:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am not excited about `make clean` not working

i am trying a fresh git clone, for my sanity

[21-Nov-18 08:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright so did the "big" vrsc PR happen, and now it's percolating in via FSM branch? I assume lots of testing and bugs need to be found

[21-Nov-18 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright and what about verus-style staking?

[21-Nov-18 08:23 AM] Alright#0419
yes and yes
