no worries 🙂

[13-Sep-19 04:03 PM] jorian#4555
looks like it built on my side

[13-Sep-19 04:06 PM] jorian#4555
does `https://www.samba.org/ftp/ccache/ccache-3.3.1.tar.bz2`  download for you?

[13-Sep-19 04:06 PM] jorian#4555
it seems it goes wrong there

[13-Sep-19 04:06 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
looking for it...

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Right, So try to install samba and try again?

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
no, try to get it to download through your browser. if it doesn't download through your browser, something is wrong

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
like firewall or stuff

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I don't know where you see that message btw

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
it's in the error you posted

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Uhm, im on a terminal, Its a ubuntu cloud server

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
the firewall is down

[13-Sep-19 04:07 PM] jorian#4555
use wget?

[13-Sep-19 04:08 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I just apt-get'tted it,

[13-Sep-19 04:09 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
here.... we go.. No fish 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I just apt-get'tted it`
you need to follow the <https://github.com/jl777/komodo#dependencies>

[13-Sep-19 04:09 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I did: 
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl right?

[13-Sep-19 04:11 PM] jorian#4555
i never tried it before, but maybe do `./zcutil/build.sh` instead of cd'ing into zcutil and then `./build.sh`

[13-Sep-19 04:11 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@jorian Did that already

[13-Sep-19 04:12 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I've also just made a recursive Chmod 777 into the entire komodo folder

[13-Sep-19 04:12 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
just in case

[13-Sep-19 04:12 PM] gcharang#6833
@kamitor - Christiaan I'm starting a cloud server with ubuntu 18.04 to test building it
if it doesn't workout, you coud get the binaries here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/dev-multios-0.4.0a-alpha/linux_0.4.0a.tar.gz

[13-Sep-19 04:12 PM] jorian#4555
how about a reboot?

[13-Sep-19 04:14 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@gcharang I'm loving the help im getting here

[13-Sep-19 04:14 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
😄 okay I seem to have komodod now

[13-Sep-19 04:14 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
lets try to start with ./komodod -ac_name=name_of_your_chain -ac_supply=100000 -bind=ip_of_server_1 &

[13-Sep-19 04:15 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okayyyyyyy... EXCITING 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:15 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I think it might be... running 😮

{Reactions}
🎉 

[13-Sep-19 04:16 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
No no, don't cheer yet.. I know linux, its trying to fool me into thinking its running

[13-Sep-19 04:16 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okay let me upload a screenshot

[13-Sep-19 04:17 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
meanwhile, I will start a second server, and try to connect to this one

I can't wait to show this to my students btw 😛

[13-Sep-19 04:18 PM] gcharang#6833
that looks correct
just make the name all caps

[13-Sep-19 04:18 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
😮 😮

[13-Sep-19 04:19 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
if this works, guys, you're gonna be very happy

[13-Sep-19 04:19 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
because I'm gonna be demo-ing komodo in Amsterdam for 120 ppl  😄

{Reactions}
yassinheart KMD 🎉 💪 

[13-Sep-19 04:19 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
so I really hope I can get it to work 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:19 PM] phm87#7395
I always used caps for ac_name. I did not know it works without caps. Thx

[13-Sep-19 04:20 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I'm also involved with K64; dunno if you know them, hence I know of komodo

[13-Sep-19 04:20 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
and I know, Bart van Marseveen, a die-hard komodo advocate

[13-Sep-19 04:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@kamitor - Christiaan you could launch chains quickly using this repo: https://github.com/gcharang/create-smartchain
it can launch the two daemons needed in a single computer/server

[13-Sep-19 04:21 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
wil je naar het event komen, wellicht vind het wel leuk!

[13-Sep-19 04:21 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Voedsel + blockchain en anders shizzle

[13-Sep-19 04:21 PM] jorian#4555
#dutch bestaat trouwens 🙂

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] jorian#4555
for the other peoples english might be easier to follow

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
nahhhhh We have to rub it in their faces! Dutchies rulleee 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
We'll make everyone learn this horrible language

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] phm87#7395
Wat is de datum van event ? Ik spreek een beetje nederlands (ik komt van Belgie)

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@gcharang gonna do that now

[13-Sep-19 04:22 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339

Are you ready for our next event on Consumer Trust? Strike Two Summit starts 19-20 September in Amsterdam!

[13-Sep-19 04:24 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
but this is nice and all but I really want to use it for the school I'm teaching at. I have 45 web-developers and I want all of them to learn to deal with Crypto :)
No assignements for grades, but coins! 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:24 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Make homework > get crypto! 😄

{Reactions}
😆 (2) 

[13-Sep-19 04:24 PM] phm87#7395
In the next days, we will launch a test notarization network (separated from existing nota network), if you are interested, I can ping you

[13-Sep-19 04:24 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
ah well thats my dream anyway

[13-Sep-19 04:25 PM] jorian#4555
that's awesome!

[13-Sep-19 04:25 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
YES @phm87  I am intrested!

[13-Sep-19 04:25 PM] phm87#7395
Good good good ^^

[13-Sep-19 04:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Funny fact; Most students that I teach, have crypto. They have no idea why or what it does

[13-Sep-19 04:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
but they have it

[13-Sep-19 04:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
which is quite funny to me

[13-Sep-19 04:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okay I am going to do the deamon no that @gcharang suggested

[13-Sep-19 04:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
now&

[13-Sep-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`They have no idea why or what it does`
Funnier fact:
That's not just most of your students, that most people with crypto

[13-Sep-19 04:29 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
ohw; if you have more guides, that my students can eat, please do share

[13-Sep-19 04:30 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 True; thats why I give training in the workings of blockchain (but not crypto) which is quite embarrasing for me as I can

[13-Sep-19 04:30 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
can't do the practical stuff, as you might have just noticed

[13-Sep-19 04:30 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
but I know all the theory, I have read a lot of books on it 😛

[13-Sep-19 04:30 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Forgive me, i'm just a silly teacher

[13-Sep-19 04:31 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
littlebit... chaotic 😛

[13-Sep-19 04:31 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
anyway attempting to start second deamon...

[13-Sep-19 04:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Forgive me, i'm just a silly teacher`
I'm just a silly non-teacher, so it's all good 😛

[13-Sep-19 04:33 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Well, you're teaching me arn't you? Im attempting to learn?
Don't underestimate yourself

[13-Sep-19 04:33 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
but, since I just directly launch the binaries

[13-Sep-19 04:33 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I don't really have a data file

[13-Sep-19 04:34 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
So I can't launch the deamon. @gcharang

[13-Sep-19 04:34 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
well, I can launch a second one but I don't know what that'll do. Lets test and find out

[13-Sep-19 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
you need miners to mine blocks and add them to the blockchain

[13-Sep-19 04:35 PM] jorian#4555
otherwise it's just a database

[13-Sep-19 04:35 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Well, let just make it work.. somewhat before we perfect it

[13-Sep-19 04:36 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I usually also start my apps with "hello world" not with a framework etc etc

[13-Sep-19 04:36 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okay intresting error 😄

[13-Sep-19 04:36 PM] jorian#4555
yes, but a blockchain exists because of consensus. so 2 daemons synced and mining the same chain is what you want

[13-Sep-19 04:36 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Error: Cannot obtain a lock on data directory /root/.komodo/test. Komodo is probably already running.

[13-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
you'll need a different machine

[13-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
or different parameters to komodod

[13-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
that is a bit advanced already, but you might need it for your students

[13-Sep-19 04:37 PM] jorian#4555
@gcharang probably knows where to find the guide on that

i think @kamitor - Christiaan is better helped with that, i knew of its existence, just didn't know where it was

[13-Sep-19 04:56 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, the repo I linked above has scripts that automate the steps in this doc

[13-Sep-19 05:05 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
im gonna test test test, im very happy for the help! thanks @jorian @gcharang @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 @phm87  for helping so far, you'll problably see me ask more questions during the weekend ( for now, i need a break 🙂 )
