If you can read C code... the process starts there.

[04-Oct-18 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
each time a notarisation happens, this is the function where it starts.

Does Komodo have competitors? In terms of offering the ability to create a blockchain

[05-Oct-18 09:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sure

[05-Oct-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from the architecture point of view? none.

[05-Oct-18 10:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no other platform so far to my knowledge lets it's creators create independent blockchain with just single command and few parameters.

[05-Oct-18 10:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are a lot out there who tie other [xyz]chains to their own main parent chain. kinda jail them to their ecosystem.

[05-Oct-18 10:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from that point of view alone KMD does not have any competitor yet.

[05-Oct-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
unless I'm unaware of similar concept adopted by other project out there.

[05-Oct-18 10:04 AM] Mylo#8306
ark

[05-Oct-18 10:04 AM] Mylo#8306
would be closest.

[05-Oct-18 10:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hm... it lets user's create indipendent chains ?

[05-Oct-18 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no need to download or have anything to link to ark mainnet chain ?

[05-Oct-18 10:10 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think Ark is still tied to the main chain

[05-Oct-18 10:10 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

Nice nice. Then what is the difficulty level in building a token on top of our own blockchain. For example sake, building a Cryptokitties on top of Ethereum. In our case, building www.greenlink.io on top of our green/carbon positive currency called TreeLand

[05-Oct-18 11:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you want to make a token on top of your own independent blockchain ?
cryptokitties is a token on top of ETH.
You basically got your own ETH if you understand ETH is an independent blockchain, to like BTC, LTC etc.

[05-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Fai#0350
I spoke to @siu - Chainmakers and he said there was one such instance before. We‚Äôre thinking it could be quite expansive for us as we will have more projects who may need their own tokens, if they can‚Äôt be just a dApp on top of our Treeland coin

[05-Oct-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but if you still want to have a token system on top of your own independent blockchain you can also do so

[05-Oct-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is tokens crypto-conditions smart contracts now

[05-Oct-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which applies to all asset chains

[05-Oct-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can crate as many tokens on top of your asset chain

[05-Oct-18 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess you want tokens to ICO etc ??

[05-Oct-18 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in that case you will not need to worry about tokens CC

[05-Oct-18 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
your indepdent blockchain is your ICO tokens that you refer to as cryptokitties ERC20 tokens

[05-Oct-18 11:16 AM] Fai#0350
Cool. The reason we didn‚Äôt make GreenLink same level and layered on top of KMD is because we want the green cryptocurrency to be paid as fees when transactions happen. So each time a transaction happens a tree gets planted. At least one. So that means we can get up to 10 tokens on top of TreeLand and it will thrive as such

[05-Oct-18 11:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
your usecase describes  assetchain and tokens on top of this assetchain.
can do now just with rpc commands. possible today.

[05-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Fai#0350
What kind of tech skills do we need to acquire? I'm thinking how to write the job description lol

[05-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Fai#0350
Am a dev but have too many hats to wear now

[05-Oct-18 11:22 AM] Fai#0350
Where can I read up about the token structure? I assume the TreeLand "coin" is not ERC 20 and neither is the GreenLink token too?

Hi, I've been reading the whitepapers of the past dico's on dexstats. They seem to mention themselves as cryptocurrencies but they also use "tokens" instead of coins. I wonder though in my case, TreeLand is a blockchain that will hopefully dico  and there could be projects that hopefully dico on top of TreeLand. So those projects will be paying transaction fees in TreeLand coins? Or TreeLand tokens? Considering the those projects will have their own tokens.

[06-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
tokens are from the assets CC, the txfee is paid in the native coin of the chain

[06-Oct-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there is a TREELAND chain that other projects issue assets on, it is paid in TREELAND coins

[06-Oct-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if OTHER coin is created for other projects, then txfee is paid in OTHER coins

[06-Oct-18 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
applying BTC bugs to the myriad of forks will get more common, and most forks can't hope to update fast enough

[06-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Fai#0350
I see. Would I be able to design it in such a way that projects that layer on top of TREELAND chain will (also?) pay "txfee" to TREELAND in TREELAND coin? Considering the projects have their own tokens too - say GreenLink has IMPACT tokens

[06-Oct-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if they issue tokens using assets CC running on TREELAND, then that is exactly how it works

[06-Oct-18 06:59 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto someone did it on CMM too

[06-Oct-18 10:39 PM] Mylo#8306
@Alright CMM has an up-to-date wordpress plugin handily on my to-do list for PIRATE wordpress integration.  not related but interesting that CMM has problems.  must be a bunch of web-devs mainly in their project??

[06-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
Seems that way, yes. I've talked to their lead many times about migrating to an assetchain

[06-Oct-18 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
They're creating a dual blockchain setup, one BCH fork, one ETH fork, but all they're setting out to accomplish can be done with a single asset chain

[06-Oct-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
Anthony(lead dev) seems to be the lone C/C++ coder they have. I've tried to explain to him that he'd receive a lot of unconditional help by just being part of the ecosystem, but he didn't want to listen

[06-Oct-18 10:42 PM] Alright#0419
If you're actually interested in learning in and outs of CMM, talk to @FishyGuts. He's their former marketing lead I believe

[06-Oct-18 11:00 PM] Mylo#8306
üëÜ  oh doood, no brainer being an ecosystem project.

got a re-org questions.
do the re-org rules say "we limit re-orgs to XX blocks" but because of dPoW the only re-org possible is since last notarization? and the "we limit re-org to XX blocks" is never reached with a notarization in place.

[06-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
most btc forks have a limit of 100 blocks

[06-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Alright#0419
so if they suddenly receive a valid chain that is trying to reorg >99 blocks, it will reject it

[06-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks, wasn't sure what the number was, but knew dPoW limited the re-org range in _that_ way

[06-Oct-18 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
the way some of them "reject" it is by shutting down the node itself

[06-Oct-18 11:03 PM] Alright#0419
which is a very very sloppy way of doing it as it allows someone to shut down remote nodes

[06-Oct-18 11:04 PM] Mylo#8306
@Anthony i haven't looked at CMM wordpress thing in depth.   looks useful to private transactions.   how easy to mod?  you got tips?  would be useful to you if your project used komodo tech üòÑ
