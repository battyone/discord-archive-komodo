[16-Dec-18 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but they cant mine that chain

[16-Dec-18 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or they should not be able to

[16-Dec-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
all notaries get some coins to notarize with

[16-Dec-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
most notaries split

[16-Dec-18 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Dec-18 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright any ideas what is going on? maybe staking of the splitfunds?

[16-Dec-18 03:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[16-Dec-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
needs to be over 1 coin in size

[16-Dec-18 03:34 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i guess staking the split funds

[16-Dec-18 03:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
> 1 coin -> about 9000 0.0001 utxos
```
DION total utxos:       9118
DION notarisation utxos:        29
```

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
wtf .. this is really werid

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
probably what happened was the nodes staked a few blocks from the notarization funds

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then those blocks generated more blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani can you post the output of `komodo-cli -ac_name=DION getblock 86606 2`

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
like rabbits they multiply

[16-Dec-18 03:39 PM] Alright#0419

[16-Dec-18 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Alright#0419

[16-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Alright#0419

[16-Dec-18 03:41 PM] jorian#4555
indenodes is also staking

[16-Dec-18 03:41 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Alright#0419

[16-Dec-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
acend is at 4300000000

[16-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
so verus -gen thing made notaries stake their balances?

[16-Dec-18 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the oinly real porblem here is that the notary nodes shoudl not have been staking

[16-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Alright#0419
or they did it intentionally?

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
meshbits didnt

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he was just as confused as we are why there were all there

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so everything is fine ?

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are the notary nodes supposed to have millions of yopur coin?

[16-Dec-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
when did the notary staking start

[16-Dec-18 03:45 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i stop the daemon ?

[16-Dec-18 03:45 PM] D.rabbani#9094
or continue ?

[16-Dec-18 03:45 PM] Alright#0419
first block from meshbits_ar

[16-Dec-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
4billion supply. but still millions implies many thousands of staked blocks

[16-Dec-18 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 03:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i stop staking ?

[16-Dec-18 03:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[16-Dec-18 03:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because i am waiting for the explorer

[16-Dec-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you can keep staking... it just means that someone else is also staking when they are probabpy not supposed to be

[16-Dec-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
are other people supposed to be stking yoru chain ?

[16-Dec-18 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
