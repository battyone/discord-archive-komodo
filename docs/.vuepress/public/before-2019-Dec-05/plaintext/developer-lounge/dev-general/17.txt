I have a few listed above. I'm not sure if there's more?

[08-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have `spentindex`, `unspentindex`, `timestampindex`, and `addressindex`

[08-Sep-18 12:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
the "result":null is a bug itself in handling internal errors

[08-Sep-18 12:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
it should be "result": "error", fyi

[08-Sep-18 12:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
reading backlog now

[08-Sep-18 12:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus you want some description of those other indexes?

[08-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto Oh, ya, well that would be up to you and @jl777c To solve, I guess.

[08-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I need info on those four index params, and also, do you know if there are more?

[08-Sep-18 12:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
related to the index?

[08-Sep-18 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i just wanted to let you know that it's not quite right, wouldn't want to put that in official docs

[08-Sep-18 12:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, I didn't put anything with an error in the docs. Only successful responses.

@Bryan_Beus nothing is automatic, resyncs are not done automatically. manual deletion is necessary

[08-Sep-18 12:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, g2k

[08-Sep-18 12:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
deleting that now

[08-Sep-18 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
with -ac_ccactivate=<height>, it does do an automatic reindex (once)

[08-Sep-18 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and by default it enables addressindex and spentindex

[08-Sep-18 12:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
adding or removing any index CLI option currently requires manual deletion of blockchain data and full resync, as far as I know

[08-Sep-18 12:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've changed the relevant portion of the documentation to this:
```
The user should manually delete the blockchain data before initiating this parameter ===link to manual deletion instructions above===.
```
Let me know if you want something else.

[08-Sep-18 12:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
`Maintain a timestamp index for block hashes, used to query blocks hashes by a range of timestamps` for -timestampindex

[08-Sep-18 12:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
`Maintain a full spent index, used to query the spending txid and input index for an outpoint` for -spentindex

[08-Sep-18 12:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
``timestampindex`` is a coin daemon parameter that instructs a KMD-based coin daemon to maintain a timestamp index for all blockhashes. It is initiated at run time and it is used to query blocks by a range of timestamps.

[08-Sep-18 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus let me know what else you need, those come from src/init.cpp

[08-Sep-18 12:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is no -unspentindex

[08-Sep-18 12:59 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ah, okay

[08-Sep-18 12:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is basically addressindex

[08-Sep-18 01:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
`    strUsage += HelpMessageOpt("-addressindex", strprintf(_("Maintain a full address index, used to query for the balance, txids and unspent outputs for addresses (default: %u)"), DEFAULT_ADDRESSINDEX));
`

[08-Sep-18 01:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what init.cpp says about addressindex

[08-Sep-18 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
going from on to off, you can probably not do a resync as you wont notice its messed up, but the problem is if you turn it off and then back on. you would have a gap

[08-Sep-18 01:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c there are recent BTC core commits to allow turning on and off, but I am not sure how easy it would be to merge

[08-Sep-18 01:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
and their code is specific to txindex, but maybe would apply to these indexes

[08-Sep-18 01:02 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Take a look at this and see if these are correct.

Do a search for "Coin Daemon Maintenance" to get to the new section.

seems quite a big chance to do incremental stuff with indexes

[08-Sep-18 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
most people will just either have CC active and need the indexes or not

[08-Sep-18 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, I realized a lot of the power of CC is because of the addressindex/spentindex existing!

[08-Sep-18 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
without it, many of the consensus things I am doing would be too slow

[08-Sep-18 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and very few coins have these insight explorer based indexes built into the main codebase

[08-Sep-18 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
just one of those handy improvements that enabled some very powerful CC functions

[08-Sep-18 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
even the simplest one, faucet, uses the addressindex

[08-Sep-18 01:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Out of curiosity, should developers enable this by default on an asset chain that uses cc?

If so, maybe I should put a note in.

[08-Sep-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
they should, but I changed the default to be on for ac_cc chains

[08-Sep-18 01:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, I'll put that as a note in there. Seems relevant.

[08-Sep-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so it shouldnt be strictly needed, but I have seen some cases where it was

[08-Sep-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
strange behavior when it wasnt set

[08-Sep-18 01:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just `addressindex`? Or are the others on by default as well?

[08-Sep-18 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
spentindex also

[08-Sep-18 01:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
k, but not `timestamp`

[08-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
got it. 

alright, things are finally cooking.

On to `Blockchain` API commands tomorrow. Moving faster now. Thank you for all the help getting set up.

[08-Sep-18 01:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
timestamp index makes it fast to ask the question "which blocks happened between these 2 dates?", which otherwise would require looking thru all or many blocks. I don't think KMD is using it much yet

[08-Sep-18 05:11 AM] jspook16#3059
anyone know how to add an asset chain to agama locally? its one i created so its not official or anything

thank you

does the guide work for the portable Agama? I'm missing some of the directories in the guide @webworker01

[08-Sep-18 05:57 AM] jspook16#3059
im trying to add it to the portable Agama (not the mobile). komodoplatform.com has an option for a portable download

[08-Sep-18 05:59 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah could be. I'll keep poking around and see what I find

[08-Sep-18 06:00 AM] jspook16#3059
i should be asleep but i finally got an asset chain going lol

[08-Sep-18 06:03 AM] jspook16#3059
didnt realize that......i got two machines going.....both mining and staking

[08-Sep-18 06:04 AM] jspook16#3059
thanks for the insight........might create a second one if I can get one fully integrated first

[08-Sep-18 09:12 PM] Alright#0419
trying to sync from fresh with all the indexes enabled. Deleted everything except wallet.dat in `~/.komodo` then put 
```
txindex=1
spentindex=1
addressindex=1
timestampindex=1
```
in `~/.komodo/komodo.conf`
but the debug.log shows 
```
2018-09-08 21:10:07 LoadBlockIndexDB: transaction index disabled
2018-09-08 21:10:07 LoadBlockIndexDB: address index disabled

[08-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Alright#0419
Ehhh, ignore that, tried it again and it worked properly, not sure what I changed

[08-Sep-18 09:41 PM] jorian#4555
can someone explain why
```
{"method":"validateaddress","params":["RGfw56VB4mjLHjgZYCokw18w1knmcKcVi6"]}
``` returns valid 200 response, but
```
{"method":"gettransaction","params":["3a49cf6441ec58e95936a27d498305f31822ffdcc5ddd987acacc9d8efa05697"]}
``` yields a 500 bad request? when looking at komodo-cli help, the way the params are set up look the same

[08-Sep-18 09:55 PM] Alright#0419
is that transaction from an address that is in your wallet?

[08-Sep-18 09:56 PM] Alright#0419
if not, you're looking for `getrawtransaction <txid> 1` instead

[08-Sep-18 09:58 PM] jorian#4555
ah. thanks

[08-Sep-18 09:58 PM] jorian#4555
it will be in my wallet but i took a random one for testing

[09-Sep-18 02:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
gettransaction is often not what you want, getrawtransaction is usually what people want

[09-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
Hi everybody. I have created a dice and now I am trying to make a det, But I can't

ubuntu@maven:~/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=EE_CHAIN dicebet EE cd3a3c43cb1089729ca6ff4f517d359225865f0e83e5d5b85e6ca709869540c5 5 2
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find dice entropy inputs"
}


Can anybody help me to understand why do I get this error? üòÉ

[09-Sep-18 10:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Vova Shevchyk ! Most probably it's because diceplan has nt enough UTXOs.
 Add some entropy txs by `diceaddfunds` and try place bet again

[09-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
Thanks @TonyL , that was my first though, I added some funds, but nothing changed. Do you know how many txs do I need exactly? I am playing in my net with my coin, so I don't have to much txs üòÉ

[09-Sep-18 10:10 PM] TonyL#3577
One `diceaddfunds` tx should be enough to place one bet in one block

[09-Sep-18 10:14 PM] TonyL#3577
@Vova Shevchyk Was the `diceaddfunds` transaction mined?

[09-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
yeap... that's the issue üòÉ

[09-Sep-18 10:14 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
thanks

[09-Sep-18 10:15 PM] TonyL#3577
üëç `setgenerate true` will help I guess üòÉ

[09-Sep-18 10:16 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
what is that for?

[09-Sep-18 10:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Enabling mining so transactions should pass trough faster

[09-Sep-18 10:17 PM] TonyL#3577
`komodo-cli -ac_name=name setgenerate true`

[09-Sep-18 10:19 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
what is the difference to -gen?

[09-Sep-18 10:22 PM] TonyL#3577
`-gen` enables mining on daemon start as komodod parameter, `setgenerate` enabling/disabling mining on fly (komodo-cli call). I just thought maybe your tx stucked because you not mining

[09-Sep-18 10:22 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
I see

[09-Sep-18 10:22 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
I made 4 additional funds, and mining was on. Dice info shows that transactions were received, but I still get the same error

  "result": "error",

Aha, looks like

[09-Sep-18 10:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Put as value of `pubkey=` with which you're starting daemon pubkey from `ac_name=name getaccountaddress ""` -> `ac_name=name  validateaddress addressfromprevcall` and try to gamble again üòÉ

[09-Sep-18 10:29 PM] TonyL#3577
I think you'll need to re-create your diceplan

[09-Sep-18 10:30 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
I didn't understand üòÉ could explain

[09-Sep-18 10:31 PM] TonyL#3577
1) Call `ac_name=name getaccountaddress ""` to get wallet address
2) Call `ac_name=name  validateaddress %walletaddress%` to get the pubkey 
3) Use this pubkey for `pubkey=` parameter when starting AC daemon

[09-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
Now it's super clear, thanks. Will do that now

I used the same pubkey for both daemons, on my server and my machine
shame on me

[09-Sep-18 10:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, its not a shame - tricky thing)) Option with same pubkeys should work if you import same WIF to both wallets first by `importaddress`

[09-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Vova Shevchyk#1106
I just created new

not yet. Just reset everything, created new wallets, pubkey and started daemons. Now creating dice
