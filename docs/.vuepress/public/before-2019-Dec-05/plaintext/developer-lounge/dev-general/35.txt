with the bip words, if you leak one word then you leaked directly part of your privkey

[14-Oct-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
reducing the entropy

[14-Oct-18 05:40 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right, but that makes it non BIP39 compatible?

[14-Oct-18 05:41 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
and talking about BIP32, guess agama barterdex approach doesnt allow key derivation

[14-Oct-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[14-Oct-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
correct

[14-Oct-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but nothing says that this cant be changed in the future

[14-Oct-18 05:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm right I was thinking if bip39 meant complying bip32

[14-Oct-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not 100% clear on the exact bip32/bip39 details

[14-Oct-18 05:42 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
or if somehow it would be possible to make non-HD bip39 compliant

[14-Oct-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
would be up to the mm2 team

[14-Oct-18 05:43 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
just for a matter of compatibility with other wallets...its a bit hard to tell people to export keys one by one

[14-Oct-18 05:44 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok will switch to mm channel to see if they can clear a bit my mind

[14-Oct-18 09:43 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
talking about crazy ideas...guess its not possible, but just asking...

in a chain with 0 tx fees

is it possible to send a tx that spends 0 coins in a no-fee AC?

`why is it not possible to send 0 fee transactions in bitcoin cash?`
Because the base fork was of Core who (after satoshi left bct) decided that 0 fee was a default no-no (despite that satoshit from bct felt that fees should only exist for large weight txes)

[14-Oct-18 09:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I just checked on AC

[14-Oct-18 09:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
it gives error -3

[14-Oct-18 09:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
wouldnt it be possible to add it as possible on an AC?

[14-Oct-18 09:52 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
or maybe fork the code and add it as a possibility

[14-Oct-18 09:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
as for now of the main interesting points I see in IOTA is they can broadcast tx with 0 balance "only" with PoW validating previous tx in order to be able to broadcast a tx with any given value

[14-Oct-18 09:54 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I'm thinking that by enabling 0 amount tx on a 0 fee AC enables a good amount of possibilities

[14-Oct-18 09:57 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
like using the chain to store data on it using OP_RETURN, that after gets notarized with dPoW for example

[15-Oct-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
@kimmel (Pungo.io) miners can choose to accept 0 fee txs

[15-Oct-18 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
can show you how you would do it for an AC

[15-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Mylo#8306
Is txfee an AC param?  Defaults to 10k, can it be different for default?

[15-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
not an ac param

[15-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Mylo#8306
I didn’t find

[15-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Alright#0419
just a normal startup param for a miner

[15-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Mylo#8306
K thx

[15-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
miner can say "I won't mine txs with fees below x amount"

[15-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
but they can just set it to 0

[15-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
there's also some dust rules you'd need to remove if you want to be able to send 0 sat txs

[15-Oct-18 12:22 AM] Alright#0419
but they aren't consensus rules, so it's fairly easy to do

[15-Oct-18 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
dust is often a consensus rule

[15-Oct-18 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe standard vs nonstandard and a miner can override it

[15-Oct-18 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
Yea I'm fairly sure you can mine your own dust txs

[15-Oct-18 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
so not a consensus rule?

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
fees can be setup to 0 on an AC

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
see PGT

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] Alright#0419
minrelayfee?

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] Alright#0419
something like that

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
0 fees, coins are never sent to miners

[15-Oct-18 12:25 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yet it doesnt allow to sendtoaddress 0 value

[15-Oct-18 12:26 AM] Alright#0419

need to find the,option to set 0 amount tx allowed

[15-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
so send 0 sat txs?

[15-Oct-18 12:30 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right, as of today I send PGT tx with 0 fees, no miner complaints...blocks auto generate when there are tx in the mempool

[15-Oct-18 12:31 AM] Alright#0419
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/0d71b6af9bf92efbd5fd6a0a8e98485a3af4ee99/src/main.cpp#L758
Pretty sure this is the dust rule, would have to test it to verify though

[15-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
you won't be able to send 0 sat 0 fee transactions

[15-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
unless you have an already existing 0 sat input

[15-Oct-18 12:33 AM] Alright#0419
never thought to try if that would work

[15-Oct-18 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
sending 0 sat txs has the same effect if you just send some other coins back to yourself

[15-Oct-18 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
like a normal OP_RETURN tx

[15-Oct-18 12:34 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
what if there are no coins in an address

[15-Oct-18 12:34 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
no utxo

[15-Oct-18 12:34 AM] Alright#0419
can't send a tx

[15-Oct-18 12:35 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
even with 0 amount?

[15-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
unless you do some serious changes to consensus rules

[15-Oct-18 12:35 AM] Alright#0419
they need an input

[15-Oct-18 12:36 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm I was trying to do an iota approach...like sending tx with new addresses that dont have coins

[15-Oct-18 12:36 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
with a 0 fee chain

[15-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
what is it that you're trying to accomplish?

[15-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
Allow anyone to send 0 sat txs without having *any* coins?

[15-Oct-18 12:37 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes

[15-Oct-18 12:37 AM] Alright#0419
why?

[15-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
would a faucet work? They could grab 0.1 from the faucet then use that over and over and over

[15-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Alright#0419
never actually losing any of it

[15-Oct-18 12:38 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes, it would work just thought that other approach would be interesting if possible

[15-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Alright#0419
allowing txs without any inputs would be annoying to make

[15-Oct-18 12:39 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
probably my technical understanding cant get to that level if that is possible or not

[15-Oct-18 12:40 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
to get an spammable chain by anyone reduces the cost to enter into blockchain to almost 0

[15-Oct-18 12:40 AM] Alright#0419
I think it would be possible

[15-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
look at the rules for coinbases and work from there

[15-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
they don't have inputs

[15-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Alright#0419
maybe just make them "coinbase" txs that anyone can broadcast but must not have outputs >0

[15-Oct-18 12:42 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
that sounds interesting, yes I read about coinbase tx and how they are non standard and allowed

[15-Oct-18 12:42 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
so make the exception be the norm

[15-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Alright#0419
you want your chain to be spammed? 🤔

[15-Oct-18 12:48 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
yes

[15-Oct-18 12:49 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
Im thinking about playing with ECIES js implementation, IPFS and maybe with kv features too

[15-Oct-18 12:50 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
and that kind of chain would be perfect

[15-Oct-18 01:12 AM] Alright#0419
where's the repo?

[15-Oct-18 01:15 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
mmm no repo just standard AC

[15-Oct-18 01:16 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
tx fees are 0 afaik

[15-Oct-18 01:19 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I get what I send

[15-Oct-18 01:19 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
no fees are paid to miners

[15-Oct-18 01:23 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
but it gets a fee on.it?

[15-Oct-18 01:26 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
no incentive probably

[15-Oct-18 01:27 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
that means it can be hacked in a breath too I guess

[15-Oct-18 01:29 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however if there is no incentive to mine...is there a point to attack a chain?

[15-Oct-18 01:30 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right

[15-Oct-18 01:32 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
worst thing that could happen by malicious miners in action?

[15-Oct-18 01:33 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
51% attack on the chain

[15-Oct-18 01:44 AM] Alright#0419
@kimmel (Pungo.io) if you want miners to mine 0 see txs, they need to set either -mintxfee or -minrelaytxfee

[15-Oct-18 01:45 AM] Alright#0419
not sure which is which, I think you want to do `-minrelaytxfee=0`

[15-Oct-18 01:45 AM] Alright#0419
but that doesn't mean sendtoaddress and sendmany will make 0 fee txs

[15-Oct-18 01:46 AM] Alright#0419
could likely very easily create an ac_txfee which just sets the default value for sendtoaddress and sendmany

[15-Oct-18 01:49 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
ok,thanks, I see tx I usually do already have 0 fee and are mined btw
