woot, welcome to the new #dev-general channel

[02-Jul-18 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
what are we deving now @dukeleto ?

[02-Jul-18 08:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
oy vey

[02-Jul-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I thought there should be a general public channel for developer stuff, not tied to any one codebase/project/coin/etc

[02-Jul-18 08:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and the genie granted my wish

[02-Jul-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[02-Jul-18 08:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[02-Jul-18 08:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am wondering if any real nodeJS/Vue/Electron coders know wtf is going on with this bug: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-ng/pull/56

WIP i18n support by @gilardh by leto ¬∑ Pull Request #56 ¬∑ MyHush...
This code seems to support i18n on the initial splash screen, but I am running into a weird bug where the whole app goes unresponsive when trying to render the wallet interface:
https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30298?s=400&v=4

[02-Jul-18 08:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just pretend to understand wtf node+vue are doing, and this bug is annoying because I don't have an exception or error to look at, stuff just goes unresponsive, like the gui rendering went into an infinite loop

[02-Jul-18 08:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
25KMD to somebody who has the magic patch to fix this

[02-Jul-18 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if I can get any of my emus working I might could take a look at it, but nowhere near a "real" coder in phone stuffs

[02-Jul-18 09:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a desktop app

[02-Jul-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I would expect you to be fiddlin' with z9's instead

[02-Jul-18 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
assumed phone because of mini vert layout

[02-Jul-18 09:02 PM] dukeleto#7326

[02-Jul-18 09:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
this channel is not for financial advice, to be sure

[02-Jul-18 09:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
so should I mortgage just one kidney, or both, for my new z9 farm?

[02-Jul-18 09:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am tempted, I must say. Kind of interested in the 2nd wave of pricing

[02-Jul-18 09:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm swing for the fences and going all-in on minis (which I'll likely regret when the full Z9s come out)

[02-Jul-18 09:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am very interested to see when Bitmain announces (144,5) support in the next round, gonna be fun times

[02-Jul-18 09:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am see blood and gore with various small coins upgrading to (144,5) and so much shit needing to be changed

[02-Jul-18 09:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
electrums don't work, optimized miners aren't available, it's fun times

[02-Jul-18 09:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
all for what, a few months of z9 resistance?

[02-Jul-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there will be a ton of ass sore criers if bm or inno comes out with a 5-6GB RAM miner with K, N, and string varriables

[02-Jul-18 09:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's crazy to imagine a world where that doesn't happen, too much financial incentive

[02-Jul-18 09:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie a more specific question, how much weather/temp shielding do these z9 mini's need? Can they be run in the middle of winter in an unheated shed/barn/etc, or is there condensation/moisture concerns?

[02-Jul-18 09:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I keep trying to tell folks that even if that RAM add costs 10x more ASICs will still be more profitable than GPUs

[02-Jul-18 09:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, power efficiency is amazing compared to GPUs

[02-Jul-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Our summer humidity here runs 80-99% and I never had an issue with the S9s

[02-Jul-18 09:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I did have an evap unit that maybe dropped it 5-10%, but still always high

[02-Jul-18 09:13 PM] dukeleto#7326

[02-Jul-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
as far as heat, I've had my miner room up to 103F for 7+ days and the S9s kept going; here's to hoping the z9s do the same

[02-Jul-18 09:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so far, the room the z9 minis are in has been 99F+ during the day and they haven't shown any ill effects OCed to the max

[02-Jul-18 09:17 PM] dukeleto#7326

Mine is in a basement so its a bit cooler, and I'm only overclocked to 693 and not 750, but my chips are staying at ~70*

[02-Jul-18 10:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

Hello,
We want to build a scenario for Funding producers and marketplace for their products. 
I understand as Komodo + Cross-chains (ETH smart contracts) are a way of doing this.
I think Syscoin is trying to do it on top of their masternodes.
Would you suggests any other way of building an app like this?

[06-Jul-18 10:13 AM] jorian#4555
this is so little information it's hardly worth it to ask for more

[06-Jul-18 10:20 AM] unquale#1948
Yeh, you are right! I will prepare a better explanation for my question.
Thank you.

What's in the backend?

[09-Jul-18 06:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thanks for the link that ooks cool like ShapeShift. It's centralized but for small amount I think it can be used. WOuld be a nice project for some weekend. I put it on a list:)

[10-Jul-18 02:21 AM] Mylo#8306
I think it will be handy as a whitelabel, open, cloneable project.  if you wanna DM me some dev details (time&budget), i'll see if i can hustle some notaries to put some funds to your time.

[10-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Mylo#8306
for utility tokens built on kmd, where there is a service provider - being able to simply swap tokens through web interface will be a handy feature.  so if i needed to buy $10 worth of tokenX to use their notifications for serviceX for 3 months - my grandma could top it up whilst i'm scuba diving for treasure

[10-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Mylo#8306
(a, i don't scuba dive, b, i don't have a grandma to top up tokens!)

[10-Jul-18 02:33 AM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus in response to your PERN (postgres, express, react, nodejs) comment:

P, MySQL but i've ditched a lot of relational stuff in favour of AWS DynamoDB. psql values data integrity like KMD values security.  good for billing systems.

E, enough - plenty of frameworks built on top of express, e.g. sailsjs - others come with handy utilities like data validation (hapijs + Joi) and plenty of docs to implement auth w passport.  No not very familiar with the manual wiring up of it all.  hapijs is out of walmart and scales for all their mobile ecommerce.  Joi is worth a look at to save you debugging time in the future.

R, i never got into react preferring vuejs. i found react too messy and the patent license of facebook a deterrent, i think they have revoked this part since i looked at react.

N, handy.  Check out some of @grewalsatinder  code - he's a beast with nodejs, his use of pm2 is something to learn from.  but like him i have found js backend limiting/annoying.  last i heard he's looking at Golang and i'm more interested in dart/flutter but likely will just stick to vue front end.

I have a hard on for AWS and serverless stuff.

e.g.  https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/imylomylo-acwiz/index.html 

was less than 2 hours of work, and i never have to look at servers and it's within a free tier, even if it was used a million times a week to create ACs.  just needs a cron job to check for submissions to create ACs and viola.

I just checked my laptop for that code, vue + serverless.  it's not in any git, so i'll post later today and i can make a blog post about it if you really want.  i don't use that form library, opting for getting handy with vuetify so styling is material design and i don't have to think about it for https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-cakeshop

[10-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Mylo#8306
whoever wants to host the webapp.
e.g. companyX hosts companyXswap.trade and they run their own marketmakers

[10-Jul-18 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
ChainZilla has an exchange license.... Maybe this is something we can look at hosting in small amounts.

It would be like a shapeshift though right?

[10-Jul-18 03:23 AM] PTYX#6840
There is no atomic swap happening in the backend

[10-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Mylo#8306
Like shapeshift, but the backend could be API to CEX or straight into DEX.

or for any utility token to use their "amazing graffitti cleaning booking service"

[10-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Mylo#8306
the point is to use BarterDEX marketmaker

Seems like you could make a decent profit too

[10-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Mylo#8306
i've asked notaries for group funding a whitelabel open source thing. if you're interested to be included in the pooling of funds to pay for dev i'll keep you in the loop of their interest.

[10-Jul-18 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"but the backend could be API to CEX or straight into DEX."
So, basically a hosted version of bdex gui and/or hyperdex?

The problem is, you need an unfirewalled public IP to provide liqidity or run a FR node to make your won netID.... somehting like a could provider like AWS or google with a marketmaker setup in a docker env would be prefect for this.

[10-Jul-18 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it kind of centralises it, but not really as the user is the one who calls the cloud to launch the inatance.

[10-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Mylo#8306
the point is to centralize the service of the swap, i.e. go to myloscoinswapper.xyz for mylocoin to use on mylobadjokes exclusively.

web server -> getnewaddress (the address giver doesn't need to be on the webserver)
user -> deposit address
walletnotify->startswapscript(CEX or DEX)->sendToAddress

[10-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Mylo#8306
like a faucet is a central point of a decentralized thing.

[10-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Mylo#8306
but there's another use case @CHMEX came up with, to lock wallet addresses for sendToAddress, starts with enn ends in otary refuels.

[10-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Mylo#8306
it's a web interface, doesn't need to be exposed to the world - just for ease of use.

[10-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Mylo#8306
lock it down to localhost, ssh-tunnel in - fund marketmaker would be next step

[10-Jul-18 10:30 PM] KevinS#0577
curious about how governance of KMD works here. are the notary nodes voted on and delegated to then vote on direction of upgrades? also, i noticed that notary nodes are being reached out for funding on various projects, how does that work? consider me an idiot...

[10-Jul-18 10:36 PM] PTYX#6840
they are not reached out to fund projects

[10-Jul-18 10:36 PM] PTYX#6840
it's a choice

[10-Jul-18 10:41 PM] PTYX#6840
I prefer Dash's approach

[11-Jul-18 04:04 AM] Mylo#8306
Also with KMD-CC it allows more flexibility with ways to move/contract/vote on stuff so there's something to think about Em

[11-Jul-18 06:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@KevinS notary nodes are being asked for funding because they receive the majority (75% I think, until f4a ends) of KMD block rewards, so they have money to fund projects, in theory

[11-Jul-18 06:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am part of Team Chainstrike, for instance, and we have 10% of our block rewards set aside for community projects like this
