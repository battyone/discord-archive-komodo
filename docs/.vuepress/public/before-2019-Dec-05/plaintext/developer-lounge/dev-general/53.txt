[08-Nov-18 03:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes unfortunately

[08-Nov-18 03:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094

thanks @Deleted User

[08-Nov-18 03:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, only for the config, uses mongodb for info ~~~at least~~~

[08-Nov-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
scratch that

[08-Nov-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`MongoDB 2.6 was released in March, 2014 (over 24 months ago). We are now approaching the end of life of this major version, and we will sunset support for MongoDB 2.6 at the end of October, 2016.`

[08-Nov-18 03:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian hey mate, can you please also add instructions to start with your rust library?

[08-Nov-18 03:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
like setting up the library and making at least 1 single example, like showing output of `getinfo` using this library ?

[08-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes ‘getinfo‘ and setup for all wrappers would be good.  With the rust one we can do simple wasm testing for future use

[08-Nov-18 04:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
exactly

[08-Nov-18 04:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with golang too 😉

this folder contains some examples

[08-Nov-18 08:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know rust. coudn't follow that link which tells me to get the lib, add line to existing code like import etc and use this example code snippet to get value of getinfo.

[08-Nov-18 08:33 PM] jorian#4555
i don't understand what you're saying

[08-Nov-18 08:34 PM] jorian#4555
i can make the readme starterproof

[08-Nov-18 08:34 PM] jorian#4555
for the example

[08-Nov-18 08:34 PM] jorian#4555
but i'd be writing an intro into Rust as well

[08-Nov-18 08:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

hmm okay. i can do that

[08-Nov-18 08:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks 🙂

[08-Nov-18 09:05 PM] jorian#4555
look again, this should do it

[08-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jorian#4555
it's not the same as your readme, since your app is about starting a webserver (i guess)

[08-Nov-18 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Sorry I overlooked and missed example link. That's good. 👍

[08-Nov-18 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I read info example and it's very similar to Golang code style.

[09-Nov-18 09:44 AM] jorian#4555
rust and go are compared often

[09-Nov-18 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
regex sorted too 😁

[09-Nov-18 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now can make a package file which can read config file and get rpc user/pass automatically from it.
no need to specify it manually in the code variables.

[09-Nov-18 10:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
need few more test code done before I make a kmdutils package for go.

[09-Nov-18 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
cool!

[09-Nov-18 10:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll probably get parts of btcsuite/btcd/btcutil used in kmd golang library

yeah, same for me

[09-Nov-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`getnetworkinfo` returns P2P port, is there an RPC call from cli that will return RPC port?

[09-Nov-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
getinfo

[09-Nov-18 06:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not seeing any ports from getinfo, at all

[09-Nov-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
what coin?

[09-Nov-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
kmd

[09-Nov-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
you are right, i guess it is only for assetchains

[09-Nov-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i can add it if it is needed

[09-Nov-18 06:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
meh, I'll just stop it and set in confg

[09-Nov-18 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810

getinfo

[10-Nov-18 04:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 unless you custom mod it, rpc port always equals p2pport + 1

[10-Nov-18 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
being in getinfo is better 👍

[10-Nov-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
some coins default to p2pport - 1

Komodo 

[10-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
nice

[10-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
i see you fetch the rpcport from config file?

[10-Nov-18 06:05 PM] jorian#4555
for an assetchain

[10-Nov-18 06:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[10-Nov-18 06:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I used btcsuite's btcutil file and added condition for assetchain too

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
can you trust the rpcport to always be in the config file?

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
because i thought it isn't always there

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if the app name will be komodo it will just take komodo path, if different it will take that as a assetchain path

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] jorian#4555
at least not as much as rpcuser and rpcpassword

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
assetchains put the rpcport in that .conf file

[10-Nov-18 06:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
by just starting the assetchain

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] jorian#4555
ok, i wasn't sure about that

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] jorian#4555
that would make stuff much easier

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can test with a fresh new assetchain, you'll see it's rpc port there

[10-Nov-18 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
rpc settings all by default end up in .conf file

[10-Nov-18 06:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can add more things to the conf regarding stuff, but so far is enough to get started with the API stuff next

[10-Nov-18 06:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will continue later

[10-Nov-18 06:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least moved my test code stuff to a package today 🙂

[10-Nov-18 06:14 PM] jorian#4555
that's good

[10-Nov-18 06:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will also need to update the docs part in code files too.... will do that:
https://godoc.org/github.com/satindergrewal/kmdgo/kmdutil

[10-Nov-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder very cool to see!

[10-Nov-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, in case it helps, for a fixed AC name FOOAC, the p2p and rpc ports generated by default will always be the same, i.e. deterministic

[10-Nov-18 06:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I'm aware of that since iguana days 🙂

[10-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian @grewalsatinder i saw one/both of you talking about parsing .conf files to get rpc user/pass details

[10-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
something to take note, there are many bugs, some still in btc core today, about special chars in password field

[10-Nov-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as `#` in password

[10-Nov-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
and things that need to be escaped in a URL often cause bugs

[10-Nov-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
also `=` in a password. some things to test for and be aware of 😃

[10-Nov-18 06:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
glad to know.. 🙂 
I'm just gonna start with basic and later come back to perfect this thing.

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it works and I can move to api stuff now

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't just split on `=` in a .conf file

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😁

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
that will fail on a = inside a pw

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have run into that exact bug

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so what should be the condition then? 🤔

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll try to make that in regex

[10-Nov-18 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
only match 1 =, everything after first = is the password

[10-Nov-18 06:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's what it is doing right now

[10-Nov-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
instead of "split on =, index 1 is the pw" that is flawed

[10-Nov-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, coolsies
