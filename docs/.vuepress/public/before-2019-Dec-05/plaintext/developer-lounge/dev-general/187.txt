which you use to query the chain

[14-Jun-19 09:34 AM] jorian#4555
so yes, you connect to a different node for each assetchain

[14-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Andy#1801
Ok. So then I guess if you have KMD supported, it would be pretty easy to also support asset chains because everything is the same except for the port and name (and maybe some other parameters)?

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jorian#4555
yep

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Andy#1801
Ok thanks a lot!

[14-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jorian#4555
but, name is not the only identifier. if you define a chain with name ANDY and a premined supply of 20, and another chain called ANDY with a supply of 40, they will both be completely different chains, with different rpc port

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Andy#1801
So name+supply is the identifier?

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Andy#1801
I found this list: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/dev/src/assetchains.json

[14-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jorian#4555
no, even more. i don't know which parameters are the identifiers, maybe @blackjok3r can enlighten

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
basically all -ac parameters affect the chain magic

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@Andy that list are the chains that have dPoW enabled

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
change anything and it is a different chain

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Andy#1801
So then I guess there is still a little more to it (eg. to prevent "replay" attacks)

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, there are like 2 ac params that allow height activation that do not change magic, everything else does.

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
block 1 will be different for all assetchains

[14-Jun-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then with the first notarization, it becomes permanent

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Andy#1801
and if I try to create the exact same asset chain that someone has already created, it will be able to match that and then use the existing one?

[14-Jun-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
identical parameters will connect to the same chain

[14-Jun-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming you know the ip address of at least one of the existing nodes

[14-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Andy#1801
Ok, thanks a lot for the help so far. I'm just trying to get a feel for how much work is involved regarding integrating that into a wallet. I'll have to do a deep-dive once we actually start integrating.

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Andy#1801
Are there public nodes that you can query over HTTP? Or a list of asset-chains and a node you can connect to?

[14-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to have a COIN variable that is used to talk to the different daemons. if issuing rpc calls via komodo-cli just add -ac_name=<COIN>

[14-Jun-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it talking to the rpc port, then find the rpc port for each coin and can use curl or equivalent to that port

[14-Jun-19 09:45 AM] Andy#1801
ok makes sense. Is there a standard "indexer" or "middleware" that can be used to get things like transaction histories etc? I saw you use bitpay insight, but since that one is deprecated, maybe there is a new one?

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Andy#1801
That will be my last question, promised üòõ

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jorian#4555
you can never ask too many questions

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jorian#4555
we'd rather have millions of questions than no questions

[14-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jorian#4555
insight is still a thing though

I believe people should try to read first and try to figure it out themselves, and only after that ask questions. There's a reason why people write FAQs and blogposts.

[14-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Andy#1801

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@Andy just sync the chain with -addressindex=1 and -spentindex=1

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then the daemon directly supports the address based calls to get balances, utxo, history

[14-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is what the explorers use

[14-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Andy#1801
ok, will do üòÉ

[14-Jun-19 09:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@Andy the insight api from the explorers does work

https://github.com/DeckerSU/insight-api-komodo#api-http-endpoints
all of them should work, just replace
`insight-api` with `insight-api-komodo`
ex: https://kmdexplorer.io/insight-api-komodo/tx/a61ff1eee265777890a1c87f286d93ff5d45c336f3c22ac7b0b0b287e580c3f9

but the explorers have ratelimits so be vary about that
alternately you could run your own explorer for any assetchain you want using

the explorers itself don't have a rate limiter if you don't set one.

[14-Jun-19 09:57 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah, official ones do have ratelimits

[14-Jun-19 10:11 AM] jorian#4555
this falls outside the discussion, but those rate limiters are nginx limiters, not limiters from insight. all except the dexstats.info explorers suffer from that

[14-Jun-19 10:19 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't know if this setting matters, but this is present in the default install of insight explorer from decker's repo:
```
  "insight-api-komodo": {
    "rateLimiterOptions": {
      "whitelist": ["::ffff:127.0.0.1","127.0.0.1"],
      "whitelistLimit": 500000,

sorry latest dev

[14-Jun-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might have to wait until all notaries update.

[14-Jun-19 11:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there could be a longer chain out there that is invalid on new codebase

[14-Jun-19 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Option is to force min blocks on new code to force the right chain to be longer

[14-Jun-19 11:54 AM] Andy#1801
@gcharang thanks!

[14-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Andy#1801
If the rate limit is IP-based then that shouldn't be an issue for us because the clients connect directly

@Deleted User you can't sign the tx offline ... bcz to sign raw transaction signer should know the vin amounts (!) ... this form requesting it from explorer. It can be implemented by other way, but it will be like a hell to users ... bcz they should enter each vin amount without any errors, otherwise sign will be incorrect.

[14-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Decker#3767
That's why i implement it user-friendly, just enter unsigned tx, it will request vin amounts automatically and sign it.

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Decker#3767
vins included ... txid and vout_num ... but not amount ...

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Decker#3767
unsigned tx doesn't contain any information of vins amount.

[14-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Decker#3767
use `decoderawtransaction` in komodod and you will understand.

[14-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Decker#3767
you will unable to answer on question "what's the amount of vin[0]" ...

[14-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Decker#3767
bcz your unsigned tx contains only txid and n fields.

[14-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Decker#3767
)) automatically ... if you will enter vin amounts ...

[14-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Decker#3767
created raw transaction will be without vin amounts anyway ... you will need to specify it separately at signing stage.

[14-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Decker#3767
with sapling ...

[14-Jun-19 03:25 PM] Decker#3767
just always remember one thing - unsigned raw tx don't contain vin amounts info. but for signing - it's needed.

[14-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Decker#3767
where you get it - from explorer, from your memory, doesn't matter. but for signing it's needed anyway. it's part of a signing process in sapling.

[14-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
satoshi design

[14-Jun-19 03:26 PM] Decker#3767
if you just need to sign something offline - sync komodod, unplug internet cable and sign.

[14-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if the amount was put into the spending tx, you would need to validate it anyway to make sure it was indeed the correct value

[14-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Decker#3767
without sapling signing changes - all was little bit easier ...

[14-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Decker#3767
i'm agree.

[14-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Decker#3767
@Deleted User if you need to sign OOT tx (as i remember they not enabled sapling) - just clone repo https://github.com/DeckerSU/coinbin/commits/komodo (komodo branch) and revert last 2 commits.

I'm using macOS Mojave. When I use brew link boost I get an error `Linking /usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.70.0... 
Error: Could not symlink include/boost

Does anybody face this same problem.

[14-Jun-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
spinning up a linux docker container and doing all KMD development in that will avoid a lot of problems like this, but also requires learning more stuff. Compiling stuff on mac is rarely easy. But you are have a `homebrew` problem, which is deeper. Your homebrew install is broken and the permissions of /usr/local/include wrong. What are they and who owns the directory?

[14-Jun-19 05:07 PM] ashwin#5867
Currently, the directory is owned by $USER and the group is admin. The OS behavior is weird however, Ive moved to a Ubuntu system.

[14-Jun-19 06:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
ubuntu will let you concentrate on your code instead of other weird errors

[14-Jun-19 06:35 PM] dukeleto#7326

@NutellaLicka that tx was blocked in block 413307
combined with the posts from an hr ago, I'd say you had/have connectivity issues and need to restart the daemon

that you have connections doesn't mean that you don't have connectivity issues

I'll investigate

[16-Jun-19 11:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It looks as though it is only happening on Pirate, weird. All other chains seem to have fine connection without these issues.
