or lets say something different form POW

[19-Oct-18 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay

[19-Oct-18 11:18 PM] Alice#9607
key is that no one is able to ruin an already good model in an attack scenario

[19-Oct-18 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can you share your past experience in this field? Where are you coming from with this experience?

[19-Oct-18 11:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Any existing Blockchain project you have been a part of?

[19-Oct-18 11:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or any of your GitHub repo?

[19-Oct-18 11:24 PM] Alice#9607
I am familiar with the bitcoin code base. I have some experience with blockchain security. I contributed to some smaller projects in the old days 2014

[19-Oct-18 11:27 PM] Alice#9607
I am now primarily working on AI

[19-Oct-18 11:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay, thanks for answering my questions Alice. Will be looking forward to see your project here. üôÇüëç

[19-Oct-18 11:30 PM] Alice#9607
great! I've stumbled into komodo just very recently and it fits quite well my AI ideas

[19-Oct-18 11:31 PM] Alice#9607
I've been playing with ideas for quite some time how to match AI with blockchain and make sense of it all

[19-Oct-18 11:45 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The more you will learn about komodo the better you will find how best it fits to your or any project out there. Feel free to ask any questions about komodo here. You will get good technical answers from many of us here. Glad you found komodo. üôÇ

[19-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Alice#9607
I have been looking into ETH, but it didnt fit the bill.

[19-Oct-18 11:47 PM] Alice#9607
I really liked EOS from the technical point of view. Very high throughput and stuff. But it is still kind of early in the development.

[19-Oct-18 11:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can agree they are tempting to look at first

[19-Oct-18 11:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also agree on the bill part. That‚Äôs obviously huge concern

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what impresses me in komodo is it‚Äôs base architecture design

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Alice#9607
I stopped syncing ETH after it ate up my 1 TB pcie ssd

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] Alice#9607
lol

[19-Oct-18 11:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
No issues like bloat or fee

[19-Oct-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
You can invest 0 to in kmd and still test a coin and even CC right now

[19-Oct-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
With 0 kmd in hand!

[19-Oct-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is Staked chain for testers

[19-Oct-18 11:51 PM] Alice#9607
yes, I have already set up 2 servers for testing

[19-Oct-18 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It has its own set of test notaries too

[19-Oct-18 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
#kmdlabs

[19-Oct-18 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For cross Blockchain contract you will need notarisation

[19-Oct-18 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If m not mistaken

[19-Oct-18 11:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain

[19-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Alice#9607
does the notarisation take checkpoint hashes?

[19-Oct-18 11:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is why it is notarisation üôÇ

[19-Oct-18 11:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It takes block hash and includes it in a spending transaction

[19-Oct-18 11:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is notarisation

[19-Oct-18 11:55 PM] Alice#9607
so it is like checkpointing, but on another blockchain

[19-Oct-18 11:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice DPoW adds checkpoints dynamically at runtime

[19-Oct-18 11:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay I leave dPoW answers to this master üôÇ

[19-Oct-18 11:55 PM] Alice#9607
@dukeleto thanks

[19-Oct-18 11:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice a block becomes a dynamic checkpoint when it has been "notarized", i.e. it's block hash data has been sent to KMD and eventually BTC

[19-Oct-18 11:56 PM] Alice#9607
its like the peercoin checkpointing system

[19-Oct-18 11:56 PM] Alice#9607
I guess

[19-Oct-18 11:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not familiar with peercoin stuff, but maybe üòÉ

[19-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Alice#9607
I did some checkpointing implementations

[19-Oct-18 11:57 PM] Alice#9607
the notarisation nodes are the checkpointing masters?

[19-Oct-18 11:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
`getinfo` on a coin protected by DPoW will have something like this: ```  "notarizedhash": "0000000922916773217667e205ff9925bb4c16cba70754acdf3a8354ce194874",
  "notarizedtxid": "9d162c25076291e35aa2b2bff7f265d79f2bd2b94e3344afc52c357f4cb9b4a7",
  "notarized": 398882```

[19-Oct-18 11:58 PM] Alice#9607
the problem with checkpointing is the centralization

[19-Oct-18 11:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice kmd notary nodes come together and need to agree on what the data should be, that data is injected into the blockchain via a transaction (13 vins, 2 vouts) with OP_RETURN data, then normal nodes can grab notarization data from those xtns

[19-Oct-18 11:58 PM] Alice#9607
ok, similar to EOS system then?

[19-Oct-18 11:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
we have 64 notary nodes that are community elected, half go up for re-election each year and the top-half, by stats, stay

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
I help run this notary node, for instance: https://komodostats.com/node.php?id=16

Notarization Detail for chainstrike_SH
Statistics for the Komodo Platform's dPOW notarization of KMD and supported blockchains.

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Alice#9607
does it cost KMD to run a notary node?

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Alice#9607
Can I add one of my servers?

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
no, you get KMD for running a notary node

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
75% of KMD block reward goes to notary nodes, 25% to other miners

[20-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Alice#9607
I have to be elected I guess

[20-Oct-18 12:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
elections are Q1 each year, and they switch over around Q2

[20-Oct-18 12:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is another cool site that shows notarization data across all coins: http://notarystats.com/

[20-Oct-18 12:02 AM] Alice#9607
If I want to contribute a server, how do I get started?

[20-Oct-18 12:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
"lag" is the difference between the latest block and the last notarized block. It's an upper bound on re-org size, there can never be a re-org greater than lag, by consensus rules

[20-Oct-18 12:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alice what exactly do you want to do?

[20-Oct-18 12:03 AM] Alice#9607
run a notary node

those guides will show you what is involved, it's a lot of work, we are constantly adding coins

[20-Oct-18 12:04 AM] Alice#9607
I have been running crypto infrastructure nodes for quite some time

[20-Oct-18 12:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
well that will help a lot

[20-Oct-18 12:05 AM] Alice#9607
amazon servers

[20-Oct-18 12:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
we have about 40 coin daemons in additions to BTC, and then a few other crazy servers

[20-Oct-18 12:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
"iguana" is the software that performs notarizations

imagine it as a glue API that talks to all the coin daemons on localhost and then does crazy cross-chain magic with them

[20-Oct-18 12:06 AM] Alice#9607
how much ram and ssd space?

[20-Oct-18 12:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
we had recommendations for this year, i forget what they were. More RAM is better, and at least 500GB space

[20-Oct-18 12:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
```A good CPU (e.g. Xeon or i7)
At least 64GB of RAM
At least 500GB SSD of disk space
Fast uplink of at least 100Mbps and very strong network connectivity```

[20-Oct-18 12:08 AM] Alice#9607
so you run the coin daemons that are getting notarised locally?

2018 Notary Node Elections - Komodo
The 2018 Komodo Notary Node Elections are rapidly approaching and we here at Komodo are pleased to be holding our second annual election. We thought now would be the perfect time for an in-depth look at what the Notary Node Elections are and how exactly they work. Whether you...
https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/voting.png

[20-Oct-18 12:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, every notary node runs a full node of every coin daemon

[20-Oct-18 12:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
notary nodes make transactions on many chains, constantly, injecting dpow data via OP_RETURN

[20-Oct-18 12:09 AM] Alice#9607
I see

[20-Oct-18 12:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
average nodes then read that data and populate their notarization DB

[20-Oct-18 12:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
and everyone has consensus rules regarding these notarized checkpoints, they cannot be re-org'ed

[20-Oct-18 12:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
for next year, I would double the HD requirement to 1TB, we are adding coins like crazy

[20-Oct-18 12:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
most NN's dont' use AWS because it's too expensive, especially bandwidth

[20-Oct-18 12:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
NN's use a lot of bandwidth

[20-Oct-18 12:10 AM] Alice#9607
that size of machine costs some money

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] Alice#9607
true

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
dedicated physical boxen

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
64 of them

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] Alice#9607
how much KMD do you get to cover the cost?

[20-Oct-18 12:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
So notary nodes get to mine with difficulty=1 when it's their "turn", so you basically mine a lot of KMD as a notary node

[20-Oct-18 12:12 AM] Alice#9607
cpu mining that is?

[20-Oct-18 12:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
each of the 64 nodes gets a fair share, and yes, it's CPU mining

[20-Oct-18 12:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
the pubkeys of the 64 notary nodes are embedded in the source code

[20-Oct-18 12:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
something around 1200KMD per month per notary node, but it can vary. You can hit a "big block" of some place that doesn't implement interest, and get a massive bonus

[20-Oct-18 12:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
somebody just got 17000 KMD I think. Mining KMD has a bit of a bonus lottery, some blocks are bigger because some places don't implement interest

[20-Oct-18 12:14 AM] Alice#9607
you can by a server for that

[20-Oct-18 12:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
and the difference in the sum of inputs and output goes to the happy miner üòÉ

[20-Oct-18 12:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have seen 20,000 KMD and bigger bonuses, it's quite the lottery

[20-Oct-18 12:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
"i have seen" others get it, largest I have gotten is 13 KMD üòπ

[20-Oct-18 12:15 AM] Alice#9607
üò©

[20-Oct-18 12:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
anyway, NN running is very fun, very educational, very time consuming

[20-Oct-18 12:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I love it and the people I get to work with are some of the best
