Especially if we talk about small "helper dependencies" that have like 5 actual lines of code but 500 dev dependencies to run tests, minify etc.

It would be nice to have like a "reputation system" where people can vouch for the code / changes in a specific repository. Because I assume there are 100s of devs using all those various crypto libraries. If we all worked together we could probably solve that problem, at least in our crypto-space. (Because we don't actually have that much code, it all boils down to some bitcoinjs and web3 libraries. But I might also be wrong here.)

[06-Jun-19 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Andy I choose to not use JS

[06-Jun-19 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I trust that some people can write JS safely, but I am not one of them

Nice work by the @npmjs security team, although I fear a future where language package managers are under constant supply chain attacks against the upstream dependencies of OSS cryptocurrency-related software https://t.co/G184ACgUcS

@dukeleto 

Do you use emacs?

[06-Jun-19 11:25 PM] Varshini#4460
how to install `apt-get` on mac

[06-Jun-19 11:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Varshini 

Are you familiar with the `apt-get` command on Ubuntu, out of curiosity?

[06-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Varshini#4460
i am beginner  @Bryan_Beus , i am trying to install  `libdb++-dev`

But i always end up `sudo: apt-get: command not found` with that error

[06-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, okay. That makes sense.

`apt-get` is an Ubuntu command that tells the operating system to look for software online.

[06-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not familiar with Mac's terminal... so I'm not sure what the substitute would be.

[06-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You are likely not entering the right command.

[06-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let me do a search real quick.

[06-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Varshini#4460
that helps

[06-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What are you trying to install?

[06-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sorry, what is the full tutorial that you are following.

[06-Jun-19 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(I saw the thing about libdb)

[06-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did a search. Looks like on Mac, you would install the Berkeley DB library? I'm not familiar, sorry.

[06-Jun-19 11:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The libdb++-dev library is only mentioned regarding Linux OS's, such as Debian and Ubuntu.

[06-Jun-19 11:35 PM] gcharang#6833

[07-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Varshini#4460
@Deleted User If i am in dev branch i am getting above compilation error. but in master i am not getting any error.

[07-Jun-19 03:29 AM] Varshini#4460
dev branch, yeah i tried from scratch.

[07-Jun-19 03:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Try beta

[07-Jun-19 03:29 AM] Varshini#4460
sure. i will try.

[07-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Varshini#4460
For me beta and dev are getting errors. and master branch not getting any error

[07-Jun-19 12:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Varshini it sounds like the dev branch has a new dependency that needs to be installed, maybe. For your needs, any of the master, beta, dev branches will be fine

[07-Jun-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
FYI, Code flows like this in KMD branches: topic branch > jl777 > FSM > dev > beta > master

[07-Jun-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
use beta if you can, over master, since it will be much newer

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@klein or plausibile deniability that he was the hacker. if it was encrypted in any way, then having access to it would prove he is the hacker beyond any doubts

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein very smart people play dumb so others misjudge them and then have an edge

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is, he could say he just randomly stumbled into it

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was also thinking plausibly deniability, too

[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's just too easy.

[07-Jun-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you! Let me try to build on my side

[07-Jun-19 03:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Meanwhile you can try to build on your MAC onther komodod - jl777 repo and FSM branch using for most recent bleeding edge cryptoconditions and not only tech and might be more interesting for learning than komodoplatform repo beta :)
In some other folder:
```git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
git checkout FSM 
./zcutil/build-mac.sh```

[07-Jun-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810

[07-Jun-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, as I can see in komodoplatform/beta not presists ca fixes which presists in jl777/beta

[07-Jun-19 07:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits use `sendtoaddress` and like james said, save 0.0001 for a txfee, or use the `subtractfeefromamount` flag

[07-Jun-19 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
sending funds to yourself will cause your interest to be paid out via the "fee"

[07-Jun-19 09:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Only downside by using CLI is you need to backup the wallet.dat or make sure you send all funds back to the original address or some will go to change addresses. One way around that is to use a pubkey.

[07-Jun-19 09:30 PM] gcharang#6833
`-pubkey` option to `komodod` solves most problems with wallet.dat and change addresses

[07-Jun-19 10:04 PM] allbits#5898
