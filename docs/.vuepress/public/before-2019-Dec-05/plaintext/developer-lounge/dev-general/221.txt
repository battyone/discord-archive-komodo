@Sentrail are you sure it is running?
`error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)`
generally means it's not

[17-Sep-19 12:05 PM] Sentrail#6141
Server 1 is saying the error
Server 2 i get like the good information

[17-Sep-19 12:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
run htop on Server 1 and check to see if it's still running
that error ususally only happens under 2 cases 1) if the conf file has been deleted or the user/pass in it has been deleted after running, as CHMEX suggested, or 2) the daemon is not running for that chain

the komodod shown there is for the KMD chain (that's what it runs for with no added arguments)
if there isn't one for the assetchain that you're testing (it'll show the params as well) then that assetchain isn't running

sort of off topic but im using mobaxterm and after a few hours i keep getting software error  connection aborted or something similar

[17-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
run multiple different vps on digitalocean pretty much same setup no issues

[17-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
just this 1 server I have doing this

[17-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
any ideas 😂

[17-Sep-19 12:34 PM] Sentrail#6141
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I have tried a new chain as well but the same as yours. so without a node added. still the same problem

[17-Sep-19 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Sentrail What I mean is you have to have the exact same chain parameters running on both servers
Adding Server1 as a peer to Server2 only works if it's running on Server1
If you cannot see it running on htop in Server1 then it's not running and you need to restart it

[17-Sep-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326

@Sentrail show me the exact commands being used. You will get that error if you mispel the chain name, or rpc ports are incorrect for some reason

[17-Sep-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, if it's down

[17-Sep-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`learn about "ssh keepalive"`
or use linux and have ssh just "naturally" work :troll:

[17-Sep-19 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
seems error with params files, maybe redownload them?

[17-Sep-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c this is Hush, we don't download param files anymore 🙂

[17-Sep-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
But you are right, Hush code is finding old corrupt param files and not liking it

[17-Sep-19 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
currently my code looks in various places for param files, but maybe always using the ones packaged with binaries is safer

[17-Sep-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
Perhaps that error has never happened in KMD world because Hush goes down a different code path of librustzcash. That must be it

[17-Sep-19 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
you still load sapling param files, from disk

[17-Sep-19 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes. Currently there is a search path to check many places, and it seems that checking the system path before the local path gives risk of old corrupt/partially downloaded param files causing this error. Potentially.

[17-Sep-19 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Hush has a fork of librustzcash

[17-Sep-19 06:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
so we have a codepath nobody else has

[17-Sep-19 07:19 PM] Artist#0765

Goodmorning everyone, i was wondering how i can create a wallet

[18-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
For KMD? #wallet-ocean-qt  or Verus Agama, or on mobile, Chameleon or Coinomi or Atomicdex

[18-Sep-19 12:57 PM] xeonrider#3120
is there a hello world CC-example?

[18-Sep-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
faucet is the simplest CC, if you study the faucet source code that should be the simplest CC to fully understand

what is supernet? a special testnet?

i guess you can call it that 😛

[18-Sep-19 01:21 PM] jorian#4555
do you mean supernet the asset?

that was my question when I read your question 🤷🏽

I saw someone mentioned there was some node.js lib or related to it

[18-Sep-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there are a few tx libs, but as a full "client" I cannot think of any

it might not contain all the latest rpc

[18-Sep-19 04:38 PM] gcharang#6833
you could use stdrpc
```js
const stdrpc = require("stdrpc");
const rpc = stdrpc({
  url: "http://localhost:7771/",
  username: "username5456474568452376746755634233413484876",

});

rpc
  .sendtoaddress("RBtNBJjWKVKPFG4To5Yce9TWWmc2AenzfZ", 0.1)
  .then(resp => {
    console.log(resp);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

@Mylo is that relevant for @Dͥ͞Uͦ͞Dͭ͞Eͣ͞ aka FCK AFD ?

[18-Sep-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both of those require that the reference client be running

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a "client to the client" if you will

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
rpc client as I understand

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] gcharang#6833
these are client scripts that access the daemon 🙂

[18-Sep-19 04:40 PM] Dͥ͞Uͦ͞Dͭ͞Eͣ͞ aka FCK AFD#4261
yeah looking for RPC client that is ready to communicate with kmd nodes written in nodejs

[18-Sep-19 04:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
a package or library which could be used with it's existing methods or functions instead of using the standard rpc calls using that language's HTTP lib

[18-Sep-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the daemon` aka "client" 😛

stdrpc npm package uses vulnerable axios lib, need to manually update fyi

[19-Sep-19 01:08 AM] Mylo#8306
If it is nodejs

[19-Sep-19 01:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Otherwise if making browser or electron app, replace axios with native browser fetch calls

[19-Sep-19 12:37 PM] gcharang#6833
if it is the dos vuln from May, `"axios": "^0.18.0",` is safe (as ver 0.18.1 is patched), which is used by stdrpc @Mylo
