do any notary nodes use fedora, out of curiosity? seems like we'd be better in a redhat environment, when things really get going?

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 

I'll be gettting back in touch with you about this, sometime this week. Right in the middle of finishing up the last problem (re-writing the most basic Komodo API commands for docs.komodoplatform.com), then we'll be looking at how to increase git and community workflow before moving on to the next set of docs.

Thanks for pointing this out.

It will be good to keep an eye on it. 

I'm familiar with the general idea of byzantine-fault tolerance systems. This one looks like a unique take on it.

Fedora has too short a life cycle imo for security patches.  CentOS seems to be okay, we used it in telco, it used to be redhat without the branding.  Had a 6 year support cycle.

Not using Ubuntu/Debian with cryptocoins means dealing with lots of tiny problems with libraries and junk. Which is why most people just use what works

even trying to use Ubuntu 18.04 instead of 16.04 often causes lots of problems. Bitcoin itself uses very weird old libraries and all coins inherited some of that technical debt

There are still a few issues with Ubu 18.04 - Project Sono's library pointers still will not let it build/run, but it's only a matter of time until core codes across the coins move to the newer library releases. Oh - and you need to remember to include universe (not sure why they - Ubuntu - decided not to make that default)

@jl777c @dukeleto 

Came across this ``segmentation fault`` regtest chain crash again.

I've been going down the list of commands, one by one, just polishing the docs.

regtest chain ran for at least 24 hours.

I shut it down with `stop`, so I could reload with the `-exportdir` option enabled for a command I was working on, and when I restarted I got this response:

```
$ ./komodod -ac_name=SIDDT -addressindex=1 -exportdir="/home/siddhartha/Desktop/" -regtest

I can just start another regtest chain, so no worries there. But thought you'd like to know.

[18-Sep-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
without a backtrace, not much can be done

[18-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
how would I enable that?

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm assuming I need that running during crash time.

ok.

read up just now on `gdb`.

Looks like it will take a bit of time to figure out. Will take a look soon. Almost done with the documentation stuff (about 15-20 more basic commands to go).

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
gdb -args <the rest normally>

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
type run

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
no so hard

[18-Sep-18 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
just use `sudo apt-get install gdb` to install gdb package,
then, use `gdb -args ./komodod -ac_name=SIDDT -addressindex=1 -exportdir="/home/siddhartha/Desktop/" -regtest` to start your chain daemon
then, type `run` and hit `ENTER` key (probably hit `ENTER` few times as instructed in the screen)
in case of any crash, type `backtrace` and hit `ENTER` to get the data

[18-Sep-18 12:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

regtest will be the most unstable @Bryan_Beus as it is new and fairly untested by comparison to live chains.

[18-Sep-18 12:34 PM] Mylo#8306
looks like you have to adjust your amount to send.

[18-Sep-18 12:35 PM] Mylo#8306
i'm not good with z_ stuff so may be even commenting totally wrong

[18-Sep-18 12:36 PM] Mylo#8306
ask in #pirate they know their z_ stuff pretty well would be my info seeking advice

[18-Sep-18 12:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo 

Played around with the amount until I got it. Thanks.

It's weird, I've never had to do that before. 

On the regular KMD chain, I can `z_sendmany` any amount I want from an address and get a success. Never needed to both with change.

[18-Sep-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
"message": "Change 0.0098 not allowed. When protecting coinbase funds, the wallet does not allow any change as there is currently no way to specify a change address in z_sendmany."

```
this command like this works fine

[18-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c I don't have as strong a concept of the meaning of `coinbase`, yet.

[18-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Getting there though... one step at a time.

[18-Sep-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I know it's a command, and I recall that Satoshi used it for the first block message, but how it plays in with a z transaction requires a few more super sayan levels.

[18-Sep-18 12:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

I just used the `'` around the array, and it doesn't seem to cause any issues?

[18-Sep-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810

Yes, but I guess I'm lazy. If I can avoid having to thinka bout escapes, I'm game.

We have about 5 commands that work as a plain terminal command, but as a curl command they don't work.

It will need a senior dev to pick through the C/C++ and figure out what's going on.

estimatepriority nblocks

The ``estimatepriority`` method estimates the approximate priority of a zero-fee transaction, when it needs to begin confirmation within ``nblocks`` blocks.

Arguments:

::

    nblocks     (numeric)      a statement indicating within how many blocks the transaction should be confirmed

Response:

::

    n    (numeric) estimated priority

  -1.0 is returned if not enough transactions and blocks have been observed to make an estimate.
