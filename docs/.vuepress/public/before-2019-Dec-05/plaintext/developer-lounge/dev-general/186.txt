Why doesn't it send the change to a new address?

[12-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This is on the RICK chain.

[12-Jun-19 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Bryan_Beus is that your tx or one at random?

[12-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's mine.

[12-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I did a faucetget command to get 0.1 RICK coins, then did getnewaddress, and then looked at the raw transaction.

[12-Jun-19 12:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do you have pubkey set as a param?

[12-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And then sent 0.05 to the new address *

[12-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ah, yes, I do.

[12-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Wow!

[12-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, when pubkey is set as param, change goes to pubkey?

[12-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Nifty!

CryptoConditions and MoMoM are separate, correct? Or does MoMoM rely on CC?

Hi there back after a long time and the issue is i am facing at the moment is about the staking server

[12-Jun-19 06:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have got thrree staking servers

[12-Jun-19 06:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
two of them are working fine

[12-Jun-19 06:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on third staking server i have got this error 
`DisconnectTip trying to disconnect notarized block at ht.315280`

[12-Jun-19 06:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can anyone know the blocks are not building up on that server

[12-Jun-19 06:57 AM] D.rabbani#9094
current height is 315337

there was a block mined with a 8 minutes delay
kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000008c87c90281557fb54930cd65f6c1928af9fa4de2fd8a4fd9a1fdb968

[12-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jorian#4555
there were several today

[12-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jorian#4555
i saw them happen about 2 hours ago too

[12-Jun-19 12:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
Ah I see ok

[12-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jorian#4555
is that because the miner set their own time wrong?

[12-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it cant be much more than 2 minutes old

[12-Jun-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
attempted timewarp attack or miners clock is off by 5 minutes+

[12-Jun-19 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RSXGTHQSqwcMw1vowKfEE7sQ8fAmv1tmso this mining address is doing it mostly

[12-Jun-19 12:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
Funny thats the default address of z-nomp

[12-Jun-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i would verify via RPC that it's not an explorer rendering bug, as well

[12-Jun-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody is mining to the default example z-nomp address?

[12-Jun-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is weird

[12-Jun-19 01:10 PM] CHMEX#0686
It's luckpool.net/

[12-Jun-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmmmmm

[12-Jun-19 01:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
I gave hellcatz a heads up

[12-Jun-19 01:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
Luckpool enabled a new kind of mining, "hybrid mining" recently

[12-Jun-19 01:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
a mixture of solo and pooled mining, where you share 75% of BR. Since KMD can sometimes have large blocks, it's geared towards that, but he enabled it on all coins of the pool. I wonder if this is related

[12-Jun-19 03:39 PM] tonystark2099#9565
I am a software engineer and wondering if there are some (independent/standalone) side projects? Could be either in a small team or alone if the project is not that time-consuming. I am experienced in Java, Python and PHP (backend) and Angular (frontend). I do not request any bounty or something similar, just want to participate in a project.

@CHMEX @jl777c thank you!  @tonystark2099 hello! I am the project manager with The HempCoin!

[12-Jun-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because they haven't done enough damage already`
It's called:
`keep recoding what you already have so that you can pretend you're still "innovating"`

[12-Jun-19 03:56 PM] tonystark2099#9565
@Exile13  I forgot to say that I have little experience in blockchain development yet. I have only developed smaller prototypes using the APIs of Nxt and IOTA so far. That's why I wouldn't be the right developer for Hempcoin. I was thinking of a smaller project in which I could invest 8-10 hours a week.

[12-Jun-19 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`project in which I could invest 8-10 hours a week`
those exist in this space?

I'd be happy to speak with you more if you wish

[12-Jun-19 05:13 PM] hellcatz#5825
Hello all.  le tme catch up on the topic.

[12-Jun-19 05:16 PM] hellcatz#5825
@SHossain Yes, that is my pool address. We are following consensus on block times. It may look at little funny on the explorer, as they do not show the timestamp of when the block actually arrived, but the timestamp that was included in the block.

[12-Jun-19 05:16 PM] hellcatz#5825
The timestamp that is included in the block is allowed to vary by 7200 seconds (zcash forks).  *update (~8 minutes for KMD)

[12-Jun-19 05:17 PM] hellcatz#5825
We are following consensus and not performing any kind of attacks.  If we were, we would be orphaning blocks and not validating them.
I guess it just `looks`  really funny on the explorers.

[12-Jun-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo consensus does not allow a 7200 second variance

[12-Jun-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
more like 8 minutes

[12-Jun-19 05:23 PM] hellcatz#5825
The time value being used it being provided by the daemon in `getblocktemplate`

we have snapshot mode for payments CC, that combined with -ac_script can create a DAO mechanism

Transactionalized DAO using CC
I first heard about DAO way back in 2014, but at the time i was still pretty new to blockchain and I had no idea how it could possibly…

[13-Jun-19 07:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
For a developer looking to integrate Komodo and assetchains in a wallet, what repo should he look into for assetchains parameters? Supernet, Dex, Bet... etc I suppose are somewhere in Komodo repo,  but hush k64 or utrum, etc. are in their own project repo?

[13-Jun-19 07:41 AM] CHMEX#0686
@KomodoWorld  github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/dev/src/assetchains.json

[13-Jun-19 07:41 AM] CHMEX#0686
I would use this

[13-Jun-19 07:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
thanks

[13-Jun-19 11:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
Last block 23 mins ago? Or did my explorer fork again?

[13-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
there was very large hashrate on KMD earlier, now back to normal

[13-Jun-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also it seems no more eligible notaries.

[13-Jun-19 11:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
I see makes sense about 17 notaries dont mine atm

[13-Jun-19 12:58 PM] jorian#4555
wow, 17 notaries say no to easy mining

[13-Jun-19 04:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not complaining

[13-Jun-19 04:20 PM] jorian#4555
you do not gain from it, normally

[13-Jun-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you do if you're a miner

[13-Jun-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
since 17/64 notaries are out, that leaves 47/64 notaries (73.4%) to share the entire notary rewards for NNs (100%) so that gives a 100/ (47/64) or 64/47 = 36.1% increase in mining rewards for the remaining notaries

[13-Jun-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't effect non-notary mining, i don't think, only difficulty=1 miners

[13-Jun-19 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
just 1 or 2 NNs being down won't effect things, but 17 definitely does

[13-Jun-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I believe the above math kicks in, because 17 > 13 . If less than 13 are down, I am not sure if it matters much

[13-Jun-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I though notaries were on a block count delay

[13-Jun-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
what do you mean?

[13-Jun-19 04:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you only get a turn every x blocks

[13-Jun-19 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything is tuned for each notary having a 1/64 chance of certain things

[13-Jun-19 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
if that is no longer the case, i think the math changes, and you mine more KMD as a notary, when many notaries are down. James would know for sure

[13-Jun-19 04:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what I was understanding, too

[13-Jun-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why luckpool has so many "extra" blocks in the last 24 hrs

[13-Jun-19 04:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
interesting, looks like i was dead wrong. if only 1 notary is left, they still mine the same amount as if all 64 were up

[13-Jun-19 04:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is probably good, it prevents notaries from attacking each other to get more mining rewards

[13-Jun-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if only 1 notary is left, they still mine the same amount as if all 64 were up`
that's how I understand it to be; but, I've been wrong before 🤷🏽

[13-Jun-19 05:10 PM] jorian#4555
yes, otherwise we would be fighting for blocks. or at least, computergenie would :abusedsmily:

[13-Jun-19 05:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries cannot mine if they didnt set -notary on startup, this could explain why there are so many down. I wasted a few hours teacking that down earlier

[13-Jun-19 05:32 PM] jorian#4555
yep, lost a couple because of that too

[14-Jun-19 09:29 AM] Andy#1801
Hey guys. I have a question regarding assetchains. I took a brief look at the documentation and the technical explanations of how to set one up are pretty straight forward. But my question is more related to how we can interact with those asset chains from a wallet perspective. Are there docs/examples of how to do that? (Getting a list of chains, how to prepare/sign transactions for those chains, etc).

[14-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
getting a list of chains is impossible, since chains are not connected to anything. every assetchain is a blockchain on itself

[14-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
you can only list the chains you know of

[14-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jorian#4555
interacting with a chain is done using RPC mostly

[14-Jun-19 09:31 AM] jorian#4555
`komodo-cli -ac_name=<name_of_chain> createrawtransaction` for example prepares a transaction

[14-Jun-19 09:32 AM] jorian#4555
`komodo-cli -ac_name<name> help` lists all available commands

[14-Jun-19 09:32 AM] Andy#1801
Does the node also have an API that is accessible over HTTP?

[14-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Andy#1801
So does that mean you have to connect to a different node for each asset chain? (I assume that because it's not possible to get a list of chains).

[14-Jun-19 09:34 AM] jorian#4555
every assetchain comes with its own rpc port
