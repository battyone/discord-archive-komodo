[20-Mar-19 02:01 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
so i wonder why KMD doesn't have `"reward"` info there

[20-Mar-19 02:02 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ahh, ok, reward is actually defined with that `-ac_reward` flag... is that why is it showing up in `getinfo`?

[20-Mar-19 02:03 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
ok, thanks a bunch, will do!

[20-Mar-19 02:03 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
was mostly interested in KMD, that's why i asked here, and ARRR was just an example for comparison...

[20-Mar-19 02:07 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
understood! thanks for clarifications and explaining!

[20-Mar-19 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН all BTC/ZEC forks that I know use 8 decimal places, i don't know of a BTC/ZEC fork that breaks that rule

[20-Mar-19 03:33 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
@dukeleto yeah got that! i'm really curious now why CN coins went that way and giving the opportunity to developers to change how many decimal places are used, i'll try to ask around and see the reasoning behind that

https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/1619/why-does-monero-have-12-decimal-places-compared-to-bitcoins-8
Why does Monero have 12 decimal places compared to Bitcoin's 8?
As the title says, we all know 1 Bitcoin can be divided to 1/100,000,000th (1x10^8) of a decimal place, aka as a satoshi, but Monero divides down to 1/1,000,000,000,000th (1x10^12). Why is this? Is...

[20-Mar-19 03:35 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
interesting explanation...

[20-Mar-19 03:35 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
```We can speculate all we want about what the main motivation here was... one that comes to mind is a desire to have a money supply similar to Bitcoin's 21 million coins... but the simplest explanation is probably the best: thankful_for_today wanted to less coins and small block rewards because smaller coin quantities "is much easier for practical use"```

[20-Mar-19 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@БОМБ ОН ETH allows customizing the number of decimals, and CN coins wanted to be different than BTC, is the most likely answer. Not sure if CN 12 decimals predates ETH or what, but the need to be different from BTC is real

[20-Mar-19 03:45 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
yeah, makes sense... i just wasn’t aware that this was first implemented in CN... i thought bitcoin has it defined in a similar way...

[20-Mar-19 03:45 PM] БОМБ ОН#6902
which is obviously not the case...

[20-Mar-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
lightning network adds more decimal places

[20-Mar-19 04:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've been at this for hours and there's nothing that I can tell that "should" be wrong, but as soon as I reboot the damn thing it will never let me back in

If you connect with SSH keys those will need to be redone.

[20-Mar-19 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[20-Mar-19 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, it's not keys, because everything works as expected until reboot
no reboot and I can log in/out a bajillion times

[20-Mar-19 05:10 PM] mrlynch#5735

does sshd start after reboot?

[20-Mar-19 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[20-Mar-19 05:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
do you not have console access to it?

[20-Mar-19 05:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
🤦 there's your problem right there

[20-Mar-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no console because it's "Self Managed"

[20-Mar-19 05:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
their "Managed" is CentOS6 and that was a disaster

@gcharang 

Can you help with this?

The curl commands that are in our docs had an upstream bug in them. They were not properly escaped. 

This caused issues back in August/September and later, while I was trying to write Komodo API and other preliminary docs. 

Dukeleto went and fixed this upstream bug. 😃 Good man.

We can now more easily generate curl commands for each rpc. 

Would you mind adding this to your to-do list?

curl commands are very useful for GUI developers and others integrating Komodo software.

[21-Mar-19 12:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto the short answer is that I've been using them for many years for my business web server and was unaware that their "root access" really isn't
I purchased two 1 year rentals for the pool and wallets last year before I was aware of how bad it sucks and am using up the term of what I already paid for (I use better/cheaper hosts for everything else just because of these issues and will switch everything away from gd in a few months)

[21-Mar-19 02:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@dukeleto 
thanks for that. will correct the docs with the new curl command

bitcoin 2 of 3 multisig has been around since 2009, and it works for escrow.
No one is calling bitcoin an oracle.
bitrated calls itself an escrow tool, not an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i am confused why you keep saying escrow system. there is nothing being put in escrow.

publishers register to publish data for a datafee

[22-Mar-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
subscribers would subscribe to a specific publisher to get the data

[22-Mar-19 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
publisher publishes data and gets the data fee

[22-Mar-19 04:06 PM] zack#6467
ok, call it a "trusted feed" then. it is not an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
what is your definition of oracle?

[22-Mar-19 04:07 PM] zack#6467
trustless

[22-Mar-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying all oracles are trustless?

[22-Mar-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible to construct a trustless oracle out of many publishers, but that requires an additional layer

[22-Mar-19 04:08 PM] zack#6467
In the blockchain space, if you are advertising a tool, by default it means a trust free tool.
You need to make it clear if it is a trustful tool, that it is like  having a bank account.

[22-Mar-19 04:08 PM] zack#6467
no it is not possible.

[22-Mar-19 04:08 PM] zack#6467
You can't use multiple trusted feeds to make a trustless oracle.

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] zack#6467
If you combine multiple feeds, it turns into a voting protocol, which fails because of tragedy of the commons.

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then how can there be any trustless oracles at all?

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i never said to naively combine the multiple feeds

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] zack#6467
Paul Sztorc wrote many papers about this.

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] zack#6467
I implemented one while working for Augur.

[22-Mar-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so use his algo to properly extract a consensus out of many publishers

[22-Mar-19 04:10 PM] zack#6467
Gnosis has written them

[22-Mar-19 04:10 PM] zack#6467
I wrote one into Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so it seems then a layer can be added to oracles CC to achieve the same. not sure why you claim it is impossible, yet know of many examples

[22-Mar-19 04:10 PM] zack#6467
there is no way to combine trusted feeds to make a trustless oracle at all. even if you arne't naive.

[22-Mar-19 04:11 PM] zack#6467
Claiming you support trustless oracles now, just because you imagine it might be possible to combine trusted feeds to make them, at some point in the future....
This is false advertising.
You do not have trustless oracles.

[22-Mar-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
all these solutions, they dont have a datafeed at a low level?

[22-Mar-19 04:12 PM] zack#6467
none do.

[22-Mar-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so where does the data come from?

[22-Mar-19 04:12 PM] zack#6467
Augur and Bitcoin Hivemind are voting based, so the total amount of money being bet has to be less than the value of the votecoins.

[22-Mar-19 04:12 PM] zack#6467
it makes it expensive.

[22-Mar-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but each vote is a data point

Amoveo reuses Nakamoto consensus to power the oracle

[22-Mar-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you can link stake to a publishers data

[22-Mar-19 04:13 PM] zack#6467
Which means we can support any amount of bets, even if the amount of money in the oracle is small

[22-Mar-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
"power the oracle" but the data must start somewhere with a low level of trust

[22-Mar-19 04:14 PM] zack#6467
You have not built a trustless oracle, you have only built trusted feeds.
Calling it an oracle is false advertising.

[22-Mar-19 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
where does it say trustless?

[22-Mar-19 04:15 PM] zack#6467
Be honest, say "we have a plan to build oracles out of this someday"

Blockchain Oracles
Blockchains cannot access data outside their network on their own. An oracle - also known as data feed - is a third party service designed for use in smart contracts on the blockchain.
