ok but the independent chains are centralized then what is the value of notarization

[02-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
how are they centralized?

[02-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you are just making up things

[02-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
based on no facts

[02-Sep-18 03:48 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
sure, i'm trying to understand how it can work

[02-Sep-18 03:48 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
or be broken

[02-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if you make up false things and find flaws in such false things, plz dont project such flaws on the reality

[02-Sep-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization of one chain works

[02-Sep-18 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
independently notarizing many chains is just notarizing happening independently

[02-Sep-18 03:49 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
ok i'm not trying to inherently fud. i'm sorry for making things up. i'm coming from this thread

how is the decentraland's app chain decentralized? it's running an EVM chain of sorts?

[02-Sep-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
How would I know what decentraland does?

[02-Sep-18 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a KMD chain

[02-Sep-18 03:50 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
lol ok.

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
what is the value to gamecredits to have it's chain notarized by kmd?

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it allows them to be a lot more resistant to 51% attack

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
and scale?

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
doenst have any impact on scaling

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
'we've fixed scaling'

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
ok, well you should tell your team not to go around saying that then

[02-Sep-18 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
scaling is using a different method

[02-Sep-18 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
scaling is solved and notarization plays an important part

[02-Sep-18 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
@scottrepreneur are you done with your trolling?

[02-Sep-18 03:57 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
that aren't necessarily decentralized

[02-Sep-18 03:59 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
but I don't trust city a, why would I accept their coins

[02-Sep-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
each city would have its own blockchain

[02-Sep-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not needed to trust

[02-Sep-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
you can verify each chain if that is your desire

[02-Sep-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
why wouldnt you accept their coins?

[02-Sep-18 04:02 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
because they have shady gov't that prints money

[02-Sep-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
you are making things up again

[02-Sep-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
a set of fungible blockchains all would have known coin emissions

[02-Sep-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
using a blockchain

[02-Sep-18 04:03 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
ok thanks for your help

[02-Sep-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so you cant just print new coins

[02-Sep-18 04:04 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
will do

[02-Sep-18 05:39 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
is supernet a previous iteration?

[02-Sep-18 05:41 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
komodo is some subsystem of supernet

[02-Sep-18 05:57 PM] scottrepreneur#8411
interesting

[04-Sep-18 07:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777 I'm working through Komodo API documentation, looking to clean up, remove some references to Zcash, and provide more info.

While starting `komodod`, I noticed this announcement:

```
Warning: This version will be deprecated at block height 1009664, and will automatically shut down. You should upgrade to the latest version of Zcash. To disable deprecation for this version, set -disabledeprecation=1.0.15.
```

How difficult is it to change Zcash to Komodo, within the code? Would it break things?

[04-Sep-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i already fixed that in my working branch

[04-Sep-18 07:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, great

[05-Sep-18 05:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
It's a Hardware wallet?

[05-Sep-18 07:26 AM] ttt#3928
Hello, could someone explain me why komodo try such kind of connection and it fail all time? Maybe it possible to disable it?2018-09-05 07:20:45 connect() to 52.65.58.103:26061 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)

[05-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Mylo#8306
The other side is refusing.  Maybe there is no daemon running on their end, maybe they have too many connections to other daemons and they are not accepting your connection.

[05-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Mylo#8306
there's other reasons as well, but they are the simple ones.

[05-Sep-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
all peers are tried, not all succeed. this is normal and part of being a p2p network

[05-Sep-18 11:54 AM] ttt#3928
Another one qestion about mining, after starting ./komodod on my server with static IP and connecting a few clients, i mined only 128 blocks on one chain, to mine  additional blocks it's need to create additional chain? or there is some other ways?

[05-Sep-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont specify -ac_reward, then it defaults to an on-demand chain.

[05-Sep-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
in that case, new blocks only where there are new transactions

[05-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What are the test asset chains for developers?

[05-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
pizza and beer, I suppose?

[05-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or is there another one that we should use?

[05-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus could always just create your own

[05-Sep-18 10:44 PM] Alright#0419
what are you trying to do?

[05-Sep-18 10:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Indeed, I migth do that later.

[05-Sep-18 10:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm starting to rewrite all the documentation. Trying to get KMD cleaned off my desktop, but all the syncing and troubleshooting issues are making this pain.

[05-Sep-18 10:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When I say "rewrite," I don't mean re-do from scratch. Just coming to it with a writer's background.

Starting on the Komodo API documentation.

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
🙌

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
there are always test chains going in the #cc-general channel btw

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Alright#0419
just look at the pins

[05-Sep-18 10:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We're gearing up in marketing for the upcoming day where we expect developers to be building on KMD -- we hope to have everything as smooth as possible by Jan.

[05-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, Maybe I'll take a look at those.

[05-Sep-18 10:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks.

[05-Sep-18 11:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Looking at this first command, I'm wondering if there's a reason why we have it in our documentation the way we do, or if this is something I can change.

Right now, we have this:

```
Arguments:

{
  "addresses"
    [
      "address"  (string) The base58check encoded address
      ,...
    ]
}
```

I'm wondering if we can put a `:` after `"addresses"`, or is there a documentation formality that we're following by not putting it there?

[05-Sep-18 11:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, does anyone have any tips about how to set it in the terminal so that the first part of the command I'm writing I don't have to retype all the time?

So, rather than typing `./komodo-cli` in front of every command, just have something where, at least temporarily, I can go straight to `getbalance ...`

[05-Sep-18 11:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
?

[05-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
same for assets, like `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX -ac_supply=999999`

[05-Sep-18 11:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
want to just put that as a default on the terminal, for at least the current session.

[05-Sep-18 11:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another question..., what command would you use on this list to just display the list of addresses in the wallet, along with the current amount in each address? If there is such a command.

[05-Sep-18 11:29 PM] Alright#0419
create a script

[05-Sep-18 11:29 PM] Alright#0419
```
#!/bin/bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=<CHAINNAME> $1
```

[05-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
save that as a file then do `chmod -x <filename>`

[05-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Alright#0419
then you can do `./<filename> <command>`

[05-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, okay.

[05-Sep-18 11:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've played around with that once on something else, will try it again here. Thank you.

[05-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is there a reason why we shouldn't be a `:` after `"addresses"`?

[05-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In that first command.

[05-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
oh hmmm you'd either need to do the full commands in quotes using that or just add $2 $3 $4 $5 I think

[05-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure what command you're talking about

[05-Sep-18 11:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
`getaddresses`

[05-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm just starting in.

[05-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
er, `getaddressbalance`

[05-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
my bad

[05-Sep-18 11:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right now we have this:
```
Arguments:

{
  "addresses"
    [
      "address"  (string) The base58check encoded address
      ,...
    ]
}
```
and I'm wondering if we can change it to the following, or if there's a reason why we don't have the `:` in the argument
```
Arguments:

{
  "addresses":
    [
      "address"  (string) The base58check encoded address
      ,...
    ]
}
```

[05-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I wondered if it might have something to do with the way C++ or Linux terminal documentation is usually written, or if it's changeable.

[05-Sep-18 11:35 PM] Alright#0419
yea seems to be missing a :

[05-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Alright#0419
the example is fine though

[05-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right.

[05-Sep-18 11:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, thanks. I'll change that wherever I encounter it.

[05-Sep-18 11:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
How do you enable/disable `addressindex`?

[05-Sep-18 11:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, interesting. 

I don't see a description of the `addressindex` method anywhere in the Komodo API documentation. I think i should add it, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

(I'm going to have a lot of questions here 😃 Thank you for the help. This should help developers later not to have to ask as many questions.)

{Reactions}
👌 🙏 

[06-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, the features were added, but no documentation, correct? If so, then I can write it.

[06-Sep-18 12:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just checking.

[06-Sep-18 12:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't see anything in the asset chain documentation about it, so I think we'll need to add info about it somehwere.

What is the `-addressindex` feature specifically?

Is it enabled by default in KMD?

[06-Sep-18 12:36 AM] Alright#0419
-addressindex and -spentindex are needed to run an insight explorer
