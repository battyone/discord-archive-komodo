well the max I meant was hypnotically the  the max it could be conservatively

[08-Jan-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@AspenShredder sure, those calculations seem reasonable as a max upper bound

[08-Jan-19 08:05 PM] AspenShredder#5419
correct

[08-Jan-19 08:05 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Interesting. I will dig deeper into the progect.

[08-Jan-19 08:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
is this research for something in particular?

[08-Jan-19 08:07 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Trying to gage the coins value over time

[08-Jan-19 08:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you need particular stats let me know

[08-Jan-19 08:09 PM] AspenShredder#5419
If the rewards were constant without a block height were the are discontinued. Therefore creating and infinite supply it would  deflate the price potentially. Not where I would feel secure placing my money for years.

[08-Jan-19 08:10 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Will do thanks for the info.

[08-Jan-19 08:11 PM] AspenShredder#5419
BTW new wallet coming out I think I read somewhere?

[08-Jan-19 08:12 PM] AspenShredder#5419
I was told the other day the Agama wallet was not an HD wallet but I believe that was wrong info. It came from your team so I took him/her at their word.

[08-Jan-19 08:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
Not sure about that maybe ask in #deleted-channel

[08-Jan-19 08:15 PM] AspenShredder#5419
I did  and I that is where I got the info.

Agama Desktop MultiWallet - Reviews and Features
Agama is a Multiwallet provided by the SuperNet project, a company acquired by Komodo (KMD). The wallet is currently in development but offers multiple unique features.

Users can choose between Full, Basilisk and Native modes and they can use multiple currencies like Bitcoin...

[08-Jan-19 08:16 PM] AspenShredder#5419
This site reflects the Agama wallet as HD

[08-Jan-19 08:16 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Do you have a seed+1, seed+2,seed+3

[08-Jan-19 09:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
single seed phrase = same single address

[08-Jan-19 09:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
HD gives you multiple address, a new address with no tx in it.

[08-Jan-19 09:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not exactly the case with Agama

[08-Jan-19 09:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm sure rewards are based on block heights

[08-Jan-19 09:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if a UTXO is of 10 KMD or bigger it starts counting to calculations on eligible for the rewards

[08-Jan-19 09:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this UTXO needs 60 confirmations to start that rewards to start from

[08-Jan-19 09:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the calculation of the total possible rewards from this UTXO stops after about a month of block confirmations

[08-Jan-19 09:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
on quick google search it's 43830 minutes in 1 month

[08-Jan-19 09:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and KMD blocks are aprox of 60 seconds

[08-Jan-19 10:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I guess after 43830 blocks the rewards will not increase

[08-Jan-19 10:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you spend this UTXO, doesn't matter to which address, either to someone else or to one of your own, and the rewards which counts to this UTXO are send back to the same address this UTXO was originated from, sent from.

[08-Jan-19 10:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
These are the code conditions and consensus rules inside komodo

[08-Jan-19 10:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can explain there is a chance of creating extra unexpected supply through rewards, please explain

[08-Jan-19 10:16 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Just to make sure I am following you. Are you saying one has to sent the balance of rewards once a month from the UTXO for the process to start over and the rewards to start accumulating again?

[08-Jan-19 10:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes

[08-Jan-19 10:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
before block 1,000,000 the rule was that it could not be needing spent for 1 year

[08-Jan-19 10:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
after 1 million block, rule updated to 1 month

[08-Jan-19 10:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the effect is that there will be more kmd transactions in network as people will be at least moving their funds once in a month, as expected behaviour

[08-Jan-19 10:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
another effect is that with 1 year, if a person had did not move the funds for 1 year, the compound interest calculations would have given the person like around ~5.0% reward

[08-Jan-19 10:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and because it's more frequent compounding with every 1 month, the reward goes around to ~5.1%

[08-Jan-19 10:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the UTXO which exists on or prior to 1 million blocks, still are under the rule of 1 year

[08-Jan-19 10:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those who have not spent those UTXO are still accruing the rewards

[08-Jan-19 10:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but as soon as the 1 year completes for those UTXOs, the reward accruing will stop

[08-Jan-19 10:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and they have to spend those UTXO to start accruing reward

[08-Jan-19 10:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
when they will spend those UTXO, it will be working under new rule, so have to do the process every 1 month

[08-Jan-19 10:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can also do as early as after 60 minutes

[08-Jan-19 10:34 PM] AspenShredder#5419
I follow you

[08-Jan-19 10:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then it all depends on how much they are accruing, and if tx fee is a concern or not

[08-Jan-19 10:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have to leave mate, talk to ya later. ðŸ™‚

[08-Jan-19 10:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just leave a comment and someone will answer

[08-Jan-19 10:36 PM] AspenShredder#5419
k

[08-Jan-19 10:39 PM] AspenShredder#5419
So by spent you mean a transaction. Say I have 10 KMD in your Agama wallet and it starts building up interest after 60 minutes. After 1 month max you have to move those fund (transaction/spent) back to your other wallet to continue the compounding. And continue the cycle over and over. Therefore, those lost funds that were getting rewards would inherently not continue compounding until block 7,777,777,777

[08-Jan-19 10:40 PM] AspenShredder#5419
*till

[08-Jan-19 10:51 PM] PTYX#6840
You don't need to send it to a different wallet. You can simply make a transaction to the same address.

[08-Jan-19 10:58 PM] PTYX#6840
That's what the Agama claim button does. It makes a transaction to your address.

[08-Jan-19 11:35 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Ok. Thanks for the info.

z_shieldcoinbase finished (status=failed, error=16: tx-overwinter-expired) 
just a question, what is the reason on this error?

[09-Jan-19 10:20 AM] $tefano.#3560
too many requests in few time?

[09-Jan-19 11:41 AM] Nabob#5004
@$tefano. Please help to make sure your node fully in sync, I ll try to wait for transaction to complete before i go for new transaction on Pirate chain

[09-Jan-19 02:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@jorian yeah mbp

[09-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Emilis#3454
Hey guys, I'm trying to call the komodod RPC call for signrawtransaction, I am getting errors though and I can't shake the feeling it's because I'm not sending the private key correctly. I struggle to find documentation on how to include more parameters than just the base tx, so any help would be appreciated

[09-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Emilis#3454
I should also point out I plan on sending the private key on every request

[09-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Nabob#5004
@Emilis Please help to check this document
https://support.komodoplatform.com/a/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama/en

[09-Jan-19 04:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
`signrawtransaction "hexstring" ( [{"txid":"id","vout":n,"scriptPubKey":"hex","redeemScript":"hex"},...] ["privatekey1",...] sighashtype )`

[09-Jan-19 04:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Emilis make sure you are giving a JSON array of privkeys, not a plain string

[09-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Emilis#3454
Right, my current arguments are in the format of `txhex, [], ["wif"]` where the middle one is afaik extra inputs?

[09-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Emilis#3454
@Nabob I'll keep that as a backup. But I'm doing this programatically, so I'd have to go digging through that source code, and I'm no expert on js haha

[09-Jan-19 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Emilis what exact error do you get? Most likely you have a json/stringification error. Make sure to remove any privkey stuff from error output

[09-Jan-19 05:13 PM] Emilis#3454
Operation not valid with the current stack size

[09-Jan-19 05:14 PM] Emilis#3454
Scriptsig is empty too but I assume that's kind of the point if it fails

[09-Jan-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
[] is not valid vin descriptor

[09-Jan-19 05:14 PM] Emilis#3454
Right, but to my understanding I need to give some form of inputs param in sign, right?

[09-Jan-19 05:15 PM] Emilis#3454
I've added inputs in createrawtransaction

[09-Jan-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to describe the vins

[09-Jan-19 05:15 PM] Emilis#3454
Like as in which input takes which key?

[09-Jan-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
[               (json array of json objects, or 'null' if none provided)
       {
         "txid":"id",             (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout":n,                  (numeric, required) The output number
         "scriptPubKey": "hex",   (string, required) script key
         "redeemScript": "hex",   (string, required for P2SH) redeem script
         "amount": value            (numeric, required) The amount spent
       }
       ,...
    ]

[09-Jan-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
from the help output

[09-Jan-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure all the fields are needed, but txid, vout would be

[09-Jan-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if p2sh then redeemScript too

[09-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Emilis#3454
Just to be sure, this would be required even if these are already given in createrawtransaction, right?

[09-Jan-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not sure why, but that is the way it used to work

[09-Jan-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it has been improved since, seems quite redundant as all that info is in the raw hex

[09-Jan-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is good as a cross check

[09-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Emilis#3454
Yeah, that's fine, as long as I know how it works

[09-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Emilis#3454
It might be security, in case you mix up your txs?

[09-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Emilis#3454
To stop spending where you didn't intend to?

[09-Jan-19 05:19 PM] Emilis#3454
Alright, I'm going on a little walk now to clear my head, but thanks a lot for the help, guys ðŸ˜ƒ

[09-Jan-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
@dukeleto trying your wack! first got this: ```Can't locate BerkeleyDB.pm in @INC (you may need to install the BerkeleyDB module) ``` so i googled how to install the BerkeleyDB module. Did all that, now got this: ```unsupported btree version: 10```

[09-Jan-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
my gut says it's because crypto uses older versions of bdb

[09-Jan-19 07:05 PM] jorian#4555
can you help me get this to work?

[09-Jan-19 07:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian coolsies

[09-Jan-19 07:16 PM] jorian#4555
i already retried using an older version (0.48)

[09-Jan-19 07:16 PM] jorian#4555
also didn't work
