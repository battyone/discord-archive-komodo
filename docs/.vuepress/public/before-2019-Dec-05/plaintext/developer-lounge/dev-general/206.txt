[23-Aug-19 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I must have missed something, because even `zindex` is off, it messed my node up, to update to my `duke` branch

[23-Aug-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
üëç

[23-Aug-19 10:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r by explaining it to you, i might have realized what it is

[23-Aug-19 10:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe not

[23-Aug-19 10:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think i need to check `fZindex` in more places

[23-Aug-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats usually how ti works man

[23-Aug-19 10:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
everything works fine when `zindex` is enabled

[23-Aug-19 10:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
but updating an existing node, and leaving `zindex` off, breaks the index

[23-Aug-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[23-Aug-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because you nede to make sure that it skips the READWRITE

[23-Aug-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
other wise it overflows

[23-Aug-19 10:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, but i did!

[23-Aug-19 10:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt  look at the code yet üòÖ

[23-Aug-19 10:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
        // These values only serialized when -zindex enabled
        if(fZindex) {
            READWRITE(VARINT(nShieldedTx));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nShieldingTx));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nDeshieldingTx));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nFullyShieldedTx));

            READWRITE(VARINT(nShieldedPayments));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nShieldingPayments));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nDeshieldingPayments));
            READWRITE(VARINT(nFullyShieldedPayments));

            READWRITE(VARINT(nNotarizations));
        }
```

[23-Aug-19 10:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe fZindex is only the default, and I need to do GetBoolArg("-zindex"), but that doesn't quite explain the bug either

[23-Aug-19 10:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
in my SetNull(), maybe I need `if(fZindex)` there too

[23-Aug-19 10:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I am setting values which don't have serialization methods and that blows up?

[23-Aug-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if (s.GetType() & SER_DISK)

[23-Aug-19 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try sticking that in the if with fZindex

[23-Aug-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r what is this fine black magic ?

[23-Aug-19 10:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, you seem to be right, i see other things doing that

[23-Aug-19 10:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
        // Only read/write nSproutValue if the client version used to create
        // this index was storing them.
        if ((s.GetType() & SER_DISK) && (nVersion >= SPROUT_VALUE_VERSION)) {
            READWRITE(nSproutValue);
        }
```

[23-Aug-19 10:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
this calls for some ‚òï

[23-Aug-19 10:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trial and eror my freind... no use you needing to spend all that time working it out too

[23-Aug-19 11:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r thanks, I really appreciate it. I hit that bug at the very end of the night and it was a bummer. This really helps! I saw that SER_DISK stuff but I wasn't putting together that I needed it

[23-Aug-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I messed with that for hours until i worked it out...

In porting getchaintxstats RPC to various other coins + extending it to study shielded transactions+payments, I saw a chance to push a tiny improvement back to $BTC upstream.

There are many like it, but this one is mine: My first Bitcoin Pull Request

which komodo branch should I try to compile on mac ü§î

[24-Aug-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
doing compilation of jl777/komodo branch beta results in:
```configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO```

[24-Aug-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I also tried changing to gcc to gcc-9 but that also ended up with same error

[24-Aug-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
tried the same few days ago, and then moved on to other work.

[24-Aug-19 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn't try solving it.

[24-Aug-19 10:08 AM] ns408#8889
On my way to home. Will check it once home. And I gotta make it work with brew directly.

[24-Aug-19 10:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't reach the point where it errors

[24-Aug-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
could most probably be also my mac's  environment setup issue ü§î 
don't know

[24-Aug-19 10:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ns408 yep, `brew install komodo` would be awesome!

[24-Aug-19 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
same result for FSM. that RELRO error

[24-Aug-19 11:56 AM] phm87#7395
@grewalsatinder I think that the code should be adapted as explained by alright and dukeleto. We can wait for @Mihailo (gateway) fix or we can try to do sth but I don t have any mac so I am notable to test my random changes

the friend helping me with understanding it all helped with it.

[24-Aug-19 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's following the Mastering Bitcoin book examples and other sources related to bitcoin.

[24-Aug-19 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
good thing is that with this I don't need to rely on packages/libraries like btcsuite

[24-Aug-19 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's all go language's own libraries

[24-Aug-19 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and much simpler and minimal stuff to get started with.

[24-Aug-19 01:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will try to make documentation on this learning part with help of my friend also explaining the maths part, if I could.
But at least this is great to practice and understand the most basic stuff.

@grewalsatinder RELRO error means you are using build.sh instead of build-mac.sh

[24-Aug-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
FSM also currently has a compile error for mac on it
