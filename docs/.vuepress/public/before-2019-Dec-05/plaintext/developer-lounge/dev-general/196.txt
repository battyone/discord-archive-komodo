yes

KomodoPlatform repo is more for "regular people"

[21-Jul-19 03:38 PM] eddiewang#1988
great, thanks. i'll give that a shot

[21-Jul-19 03:38 PM] eddiewang#1988
there aren't any breaking RPC changes right?

[21-Jul-19 03:38 PM] eddiewang#1988
mainly pool / mining related RPCs

[21-Jul-19 03:39 PM] eddiewang#1988
i know the prebuilt binaries are out of date with current master

[21-Jul-19 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`there aren't any breaking RPC changes right?`
those are most generally avoided in Komodo

[21-Jul-19 03:39 PM] eddiewang#1988
i'm glad to hear that üòõ but that wasn't the case with master vs. the binaries avl in releases

[21-Jul-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I can't think of a pool related rpc change, at all ü§î

[21-Jul-19 03:40 PM] eddiewang#1988
hmm. @NickH ?

[21-Jul-19 03:40 PM] eddiewang#1988

Recently $KMD importprivkey RPC learned how to import keys from any coin! Now $HUSH can trivially import privkeys from our old chain! The next release of SilentDragon will make claiming funds on our new mainnet super easy ü•≥

Has anybody tried to port komodo to any of the BSDs?

[22-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
@Blue M'aiq doubt it, radix42#3743 would likely be a good person to talk about it. I see she has BSD binaries for zcash on her site. She did the ARM port of komodod

[22-Jul-19 10:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Blue M'aiq yes, FreeBSD mostly works. OpenBSD is missing some important dependencies like Rust. If you are a BSD lover, we would love some help. I would love to run Hush+KMD on openbsd.

[22-Jul-19 10:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
radix42 is the BSD whisperer

[23-Jul-19 01:21 AM] Mylo#8306
running on bsd would be cool.  i can fire up a bsd server.  i know some service providers prefer bsd.

I had a RICK chain go on a fork.

[23-Jul-19 01:22 AM] Mylo#8306
fixed it with invalidateblock/reconsiderblock

[23-Jul-19 01:22 AM] Mylo#8306
the helpful _please help human_ statement was not accurately reporting when the fork point was however.

[23-Jul-19 10:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo how was it wrong?

current tip: 128602
fork point: 122908 <--- wrong   5694 blocks to here.

reconsider block: 122212  <---- actual fork point

[23-Jul-19 11:01 AM] Mylo#8306
the fork point detection.  maybe it found more forks points on the network?

[23-Jul-19 11:01 AM] Mylo#8306
@dukeleto yeah sorry, i should have given a bit more razor sharp focus than leaving the clues dangling in the wind

[23-Jul-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo yeah, maybe there were multiple forks. The code that prints the info in "help me human" could maybe be improved, too.

[23-Jul-19 11:07 AM] Mylo#8306
yep.  no need to guess, just tell how to fix.  look up explorer.  i just guessed in 1k block intervals.  took about 15 guesses halving each time üòÉ

@dukeleto i just started with messing around with FreeBSD about a month ago. I'm putting together a small SSH server to tinker with. I'll let ya know if I come up with something.

How much RAM is too much RAM for a dev machine?

[23-Jul-19 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326

32GB of DDR4 for $140! I remember paying $200 for 4MB of RAM, so I could play games in DOS

[23-Jul-19 04:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
64GB seems to be the current max for DDR4 normal mobo's

was looking forward to 77GB, darn

I am building a new 3rd gen Ryzen desktop dev machine, for fun and to have a damn fast place to compile stuff

it will also allow me to performance test shielded transactions on this new CPU, nobody has any stats

3rd gen stuff are making Threadripper prices come down, but they are still expensive

interesting that secp256k1 verification isnt sped up very much. makes a signature based mining an intriguing possibility

[25-Jul-19 09:27 AM] qqil#7977
testnet exists for komodo? or maybe somewhere i can get  small amount of kmd for testing ?

[25-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you want to test

[25-Jul-19 09:29 AM] qqil#7977
my integration, i need to make few minimal transactions

[25-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you can test nspv, very easy to use, 300kb executable and 3MB RAM footprint

[25-Jul-19 09:33 AM] qqil#7977
nspv - it is somekind of mode for node ?

[25-Jul-19 09:35 AM] qqil#7977
looks like it will not work for me

[25-Jul-19 09:36 AM] qqil#7977
so, there is no testnet and no faucets to get small amount of coins?

[25-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv allows to make transactions, of course you can use the normal komodod

[25-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if you need some coins to test with, just post your address

thank you! you saved me some time üòâ

[25-Jul-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil we make test chains in KMD world, not testnets. We have tools that make creating new chains trivial, so when you ask for a "testnet", we call that a "testchain" here. A testchain is better and more general than a testnet

[25-Jul-19 12:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
we also do have regtests and tests that can talk to a testnet/testchain

[25-Jul-19 12:26 PM] qqil#7977
idk how you name it, but in general, working with other coins, it is testnet. also in electrumx i can't see anything except Komodo network (no private chain network, etc.)

[25-Jul-19 12:26 PM] qqil#7977
@dukeleto

[25-Jul-19 12:27 PM] qqil#7977
do you have any docs how to create testchain?

hm... this definetly an overkill just to test sending tx and monitor addresses

[25-Jul-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why i suggested nspv

[25-Jul-19 12:35 PM] qqil#7977

and also do spend

[25-Jul-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil a testnet is a way to make "test coins". A test chain does the same thing. What exactly are you trying to do? It's just one short CLI command to make a test chain

[25-Jul-19 12:37 PM] qqil#7977
i have setup with electrumx and node. electrumx monitor any amount of my addresses..

[25-Jul-19 12:37 PM] qqil#7977
the thing that i test is creating multisig address

[25-Jul-19 12:38 PM] qqil#7977
so my system should detect deposit

[25-Jul-19 12:38 PM] qqil#7977
and create withdraw with multisig

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
./komodod -ac_name=TESTMULTISIG -ac_reward=11000000000

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then do ./komodo-cli getinfo

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to get all the ports etc.

[25-Jul-19 12:39 PM] qqil#7977
network params are same as mainnet?

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] qqil#7977
for address generation

node in offline mode is able to sign transaction or not?

[25-Jul-19 01:35 PM] qqil#7977
```the transaction was rejected by network rules.\n\n16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)``` üò¶

[25-Jul-19 01:36 PM] qqil#7977
for some other coins it was ok

[25-Jul-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@qqil yes, signing offline is fine, just like BTC
