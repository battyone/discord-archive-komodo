notary nodes you mean?

[12-Feb-19 09:08 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I mean for Notary nodes there are just 64 right?

[12-Feb-19 09:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes

[12-Feb-19 09:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
15 per region and 4 dev nodes

I learned go web development in last few days, and was thinking to make the simplest web app using most basic API.
just for learning sake and documenting it as some example app.

[13-Feb-19 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll do that anyway, but will push myself to make this web app in combination of Golang + QT.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i was fighting those linking errors for a while, but i thought my latest commits fixed it. i was only testing on gcc 5.4

[14-Feb-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
adding `inline` on the definition of `tx_height` made it link on my compiler, but a lot of things I thought should work, didn't

[14-Feb-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
depending on where I would define tx_height(), i would get link errors in different files

[14-Feb-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
those tests only exist in my branch, so far

90af451822a on my dpowminconfs branch builds/links/runs on gcc 5.x, which is the default compiler on ubuntu 16.04 LTS

[14-Feb-19 01:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
i hate link errors that are compiler-dependent. I guess i am doing something that is "undefined behavior" or some garbage

[14-Feb-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
didn't think it was possible for something on debian to ever be newer than on ubuntu :troll:

[14-Feb-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or did you just turn off updates?

[14-Feb-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS default compiler is gcc 5.4.x, still

[14-Feb-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
it is on 2 ubuntu servers i have, maybe some setting is turned off, but i don't think so

[14-Feb-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i often use newer compilers, but writing code that only compiles on newer compilers and breaks on default compiler of 16.04 ... that is shitty

[14-Feb-19 01:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are no other gcc versions installed on either machine, either

@jl777c i tried komodo_notary.h, but i will try that

[14-Feb-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have tried like 3 or 4 places now

[14-Feb-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if a file says it cant find it, #include komodo_defs.h in that file

[14-Feb-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
these things are  much trickier than it seems

[14-Feb-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, they are. I feel like i understand this stuff, but exactly where you define some things seem very fragile

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a lot of times, it just evolved to be where it had to be

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
i ran into bugs where i was including komodo_validation.h multiple times, but it would compile fine on clang. But blows up on gcc 5.x

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
#ifndef H_KOMODO_VALIDATION_H

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
#define H_KOMODO_VALIDATION_H

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
at the top of the file

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and #endif at the bottom

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, i think some header files have guards like that, some don't.

[14-Feb-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can include it a zillion times and it wont matter

[14-Feb-19 02:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will do that too

[14-Feb-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
likely most never expected to be included more than once

[14-Feb-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems it can never really hurt

[14-Feb-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
though a few times I took advantage of suchthings, combined with #undef in conditionals

[14-Feb-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
redefining some internally used variables

[14-Feb-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i never ran into this, until GIN's codebase, which has no main.cpp

[14-Feb-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so you cant blindly do it to all

[14-Feb-19 02:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
this issue with KMD is that i am migrating codes from external dpow coins to KMD, but KMD has no komodo_validationX.h

[14-Feb-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that seems to be the core reason of why I am running into this stuff. It's teaching me a lot, whether I like it or not

[14-Feb-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, it is in the external coin codebase?

[14-Feb-19 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
misunderstood. in that case, i have no idea. hopefully removing the recursive includes will help matters

[14-Feb-19 02:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
the questions above are for the KMD codebase

[14-Feb-19 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
but I first started to run into similar link-time issues in GIN, and it's all related to `tx_height()` which gets used in multiple places

[14-Feb-19 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
these are the files that currently define/reference tx_height: ```
src/komodo_notary.h
src/wallet/asyncrpcoperation_sendmany.cpp
src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp
src/wallet/wallet.cpp
```

[14-Feb-19 02:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
it compiles and runs file on gcc 5.x . but fails to link on gcc-6 for CG, it seems. I will take your advice from above and see what happens. I haven't tried something like that yet

[14-Feb-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's kind of scary that i can write code which I think works, compile it, link it, run it, push it to github. But it doesn't even link on another compiler
