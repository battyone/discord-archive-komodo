[26-Oct-18 09:25 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
So my advice would be to go with a fresh SQLite, using a simple table as a KV store, and having the power of introducing more complex structures if and when you need it.

[26-Oct-18 09:30 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Advantages of SQLite over LevelDB/RocksDB is that the classical B+tree algorithm, when done right, is still faster than the LevelDB layered append-only thing. And that you can connect from multiple processes, watching what's going on in the database while your app works (plus SQL makes it easier to do). And when you need indexing and stuff, you just have it and don't need to compensate with complex database-like layers in your app.

[26-Oct-18 09:32 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
On the other hand, if you need the absolute-best recoverability, or if you want to be able to backup your database always with but a simple rsync, then go with LevelDB/RocksDB. The append-only approach there makes the database pretty much unsinkable (until there's a bug in the implementation, unfortunately LevelDB isn't 100% bug free, but a chance of stumbling upon one is very small).

[26-Oct-18 09:36 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Ping me if you need further help with [tuning] SQLite.

[26-Oct-18 09:51 AM] Mylo#8306
Absolute best recoverability is handled by the blockchain if resync required if the design/workflow of this app can be handled like this.  Portability and sql-ness of using SQLite sounds much more advantageous imo

[26-Oct-18 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
But not sure exactly what app is doing, so maybe not a good opinion:)

[26-Oct-18 09:57 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
So, blockchain is a distributed database which is of course cool but an entirely different field. But the local database used by a blockchain isn't always reliable. When you crash or kill `komodod`, for example, you can loose the local blockchain and will need to wait for quite some time for resync. LevelDB/RocksDB approach and implementation, if we look at them in isolation from the distributed ledger/backup aspects, is the most resilient one in that local operation regard.
SQLite is durable as well, but due to the more invasive nature of B+tree operations the durability there is more precarious and can be toppled when hardware misbehaves.

[26-Oct-18 10:21 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Or when the user misbehaves, like when I copy a database which is being in use (my favorite thing to do with embedded database).

@artemciy_dice thanks for detailed advice üòÉ

[26-Oct-18 10:22 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
So if you want your app on a USB stick...

[26-Oct-18 10:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll give sqlite try with go

[26-Oct-18 10:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so far I couldn't find b-tree with sqlite3 packages for golang

[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but, after reading your details on it, looks good option.

[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will be experimenting with first file system append only file

[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and then sqlite

[26-Oct-18 10:28 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Cool. On spindle disks I would usually do`PRAGMA page_size = 32768` in Sqlite in order to decrease the number of I/O seeks in B+tree, though on the SSD you should match the page_size to the SSD page size instead.

[26-Oct-18 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@artemciy_dice do you know if there's recthinkdb portable ?

[26-Oct-18 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means using the rethinkdb as portable database ?

[26-Oct-18 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or what you think of rethinkdb in general?

[26-Oct-18 10:30 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Yes, RocksDB can be embedded and used for portable (think USB stick) databases, it's a very good match.

[26-Oct-18 10:32 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
I think LevelDB is Google's abandonware and RocksDB is a version where developers cared to tune the performance more and kept adding features to it.

[26-Oct-18 10:33 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Haven't used it recently though.

I got confused of your RocksDB reference with RethinkDb for a moment üòÖ

[26-Oct-18 10:35 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Ah, sorry.

[26-Oct-18 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have seen golanguage packages which uses RethinkDB as portable database, but I fear to use them, considering how experimental they could be

[26-Oct-18 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since all of them are 3rd party

[26-Oct-18 10:37 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
RethinkDB developers never went embedded AFAIK, they didn't even manage to go as far as making the core database reasonably efficient. I love the interface and the automatic High-Availability reliability aspects, but it wasn't a very practical solution last time I checked, performance-wise.

[26-Oct-18 10:38 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
What do you mean by portable?

[26-Oct-18 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means if I have on my machine rethinkdb installed, and I run rethinkdb as a daemon, I can make the database talk to my app.
on user end, they would not necessarily have the rethinkdb daemon installed.
the other option is I bundle the cross-platform rethinkdb binaries with the app and run it in the backend, but then again I think if it's good to it that way

[26-Oct-18 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I mainly like rethinkdb for it's realtime data updates

[26-Oct-18 10:46 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Using a database you like is a long-term investment (that is, it should help you to do more stuff with the project), I'd say try bundling it and see how it goes. But maybe give this experiment a timeframe.
