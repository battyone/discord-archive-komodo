back up the current one

[11-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then put the old one back yes

[11-Dec-18 09:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i will do a backup in case of the current one

[11-Dec-18 09:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the old one is like wallet213128.bak?

[11-Dec-18 09:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and its corrupted

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have been messing with a few things latley tryig to make the walet less prone to corruption with absolutly no luck at all üò¶ it seems if you do extreme amoutns to txs they just break... espeically PoS mining 100% of the the chains blocks (or close to it)

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes indeed true as it did for me as well

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so what ill do now

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the old wallet will need to be renamed to just `wallet.dat`

[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i ll make a backup first of all of the current wallet.dat

[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
then ill cpy current wallet.dat into the wallet.bak

[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then change that wallet.bak to the new wallet.dat

[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then run the -salvagewallet command?

[11-Dec-18 09:55 AM] D.rabbani#9094
what do you say ?

[11-Dec-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks right to me

[11-Dec-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i did that but no luck

[11-Dec-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i think the balance is fully recoverd as i have

[11-Dec-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
stored all the private keys

[11-Dec-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
apart from the address that is recieving the mining reward

That reads to me like Chris Pacia has misinterpreted Wright's words
merchants aren't miners and therefore have no right to reject a transaction because only nodes can reject transactions and only miners are nodes

Hey all. Does the testnet work for the Sapling update? I'm trying to run it but get:

we usually just spin up a new assetchain via -ac_name= and other -ac parameters

[12-Dec-18 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if the actual testnet is still working

[12-Dec-18 02:53 PM] johnjeg#6092
We want to support the new sapling transaction in the Coinomi wallet and it can be done by re-implementing the transaction format and signatures. We cannot just update the nodes, the actual clients need to be updated.

[12-Dec-18 02:54 PM] johnjeg#6092
the hard fork being few days from now, presents problems for us

[12-Dec-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the same transaction format as for ZEC

[12-Dec-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
tx version 4

[12-Dec-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`we usually just spin up a new assetchain via -ac_name= and other -ac parameters`
@johnjeg what he's saying is that you can fire up 2 nodes with any params you want and freely test
`komodod -ac_name=COINOMITEST  -ac_supply=1000000 -gen`
should be good enough to do whatever you need for KMD transactions

[12-Dec-18 03:01 PM] johnjeg#6092
thanks

[12-Dec-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
to test post-sapling activation, there is a test chain with sapling already activated

[12-Dec-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain what are the parameters for the sapling test chain?

[12-Dec-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do a getinfo call on the chain it will display the rpc port

[12-Dec-18 03:02 PM] johnjeg#6092
@jl777c I know that it's the same tx format. There are some params though: SAPLING_BRANCH_ID and SAPLING_VERSION_GROUP_ID

[12-Dec-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810

timestamp is 1544835600?

[12-Dec-18 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the trigger timestamp. it goes backwards 30 blocks, scans from there the earliest transition across that timestamp and then adds 60 blocks to that, so it will end up around 1am

Ah, may have been to a reorg on chain I'm working on

[14-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem to be because of the reorg

[14-Dec-18 10:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, the print happens initially and when a block is mined but tx is not in the mined block. I do not know how long do you have that print? It should be resolved in block or two.

[14-Dec-18 10:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah huh ü§î

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That is very strange, as the wallet code checks if the tx is already in it

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the second time, it should not print anything

[14-Dec-18 10:41 AM] Mihailo#5902
If it does not mine a tx in next two blocks then the print will probably be there until the node relay tx again.

[14-Dec-18 10:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
@blackjok3r the tx is not mined, that's why it prints. The thing is why it didn't mine it yet.

[14-Dec-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am only guessing here, but it must see it in the second mempool and tyry to add it to the wallet twice. Cant say i've noticed it myself... but it make sense.

[14-Dec-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for CC chains, it is doing the loop adding it back in

[14-Dec-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I understand the loop ...

[14-Dec-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I just dont see why it is adding to the wallet multiple times, as the wallet checks this on the first or second line of AddTo Wallet

[14-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and should not proceed

[14-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to adding it again

[14-Dec-18 10:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe it does not need the second mempool

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As I think all it takes is the tx itself and just removes all the other metadata

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
butit is adding to tmpmempool, which doesnt have it

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
then again to the real mempool, which hadit removed, so is added again

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess 3 times?

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe just a vecor of txs is a better thing to use?

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I used a tmpmempool to just get it working as fast as possible.

[14-Dec-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I never assumed that would be the permanent fix

[14-Dec-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to work

[14-Dec-18 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes it works, but it seems a round about way of doing it with too much overhead

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
alternative is to push the block being validated down into the CC validation code

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
which would then have to resolved dependencies in some way

[14-Dec-18 10:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I will have a play with it soon, on a test chain here, see if I can just use a vector of txs instead of an entire mempool to store the tx

[14-Dec-18 10:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As I originally thaught that there was more data than just the tx in the mempool, but all it does is take the tx from the mempool and add it to the other one ... so that other data is lost anyway.

[14-Dec-18 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it can all stay as it is... just dont use the mempool object to store the temp txs
