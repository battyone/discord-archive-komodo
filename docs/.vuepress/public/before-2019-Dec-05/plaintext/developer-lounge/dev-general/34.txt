Hello all, do you have any resource to share regaring how to build sidechain in KMD plarfrom ?

[14-Oct-18 09:33 AM] {RSM} Skywall#8892
I am not developer but we are in the process  of selecting a platfrom to build our project on top. I need to produce some docs for our devs so they can select the best condidate

Thanks for rhe docs , I am guessing that all this docs will work with test net ?

[14-Oct-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Since assetchains can be spun and killed at will, there is no "test net" (or at least not in the traditional sense)

[14-Oct-18 10:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, as ComputerGenie said. In my case it was to set up a few assetchains to test things on, but they are assetchains that I could have used for any purpose.

@dukeleto Thanks. If I execute `chmod a+x app/bin/marketmaker/linux/marketmaker`, the EACCESS alert window disappears indeed.

Now, in the `master` branch of the dico-app, I get the same https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/issues/56 error as I have in `develop`. Would be great to have a diagnose of / solution for this

why so skeptic? It's a university paper, not a ico

I haven't read the details yet, I hope something good comes from it

[14-Oct-18 04:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a trusted source of past merkle roots, it can be done

[14-Oct-18 04:37 PM] PTYX#6840
Trusted doesn't have to be centralized does it?

[14-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes could store it

[14-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I can envision a small set of data that can be used to validate all past transactions

[14-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so archival nodes + this small set of data to get current

[14-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then all current nodes continually update the required small set of data

[14-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
would be complex to implement, but doesnt seem impossible

Saw it when linked a week or two ago

[14-Oct-18 05:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I always read that proofs as envisioned by Satoshi has proven too hard to develop, so Electrum is good enough but not 100%. This was also an argument by Core for keeping the blocksize at 1mb so that every user can run a full node

[14-Oct-18 05:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
Electrum is less secure, in some situations, such as a chainfork

[14-Oct-18 05:04 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I agree, but if we can take the best of both why not? I'm sure such developments will come

[14-Oct-18 05:05 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
well electrum afak delegates the tx check and broadcast to a single node...if node is on a fork or its attacked yes u're fucked...and also the node could perform additional data-mining on people using it...

[14-Oct-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
when there is a chainfork, the light wallet node follows whatever chain the server it happens to talk to is using, and that is randomized on startup in Electrum

[14-Oct-18 05:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
some electrum clients have better randomization than others, some coins have only 1 or 2 servers

[14-Oct-18 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
a full node is more safe in those situations. For BTC there are dozens of servers that use to randomly pick from, makes it a bit more secure

[14-Oct-18 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
electrum servers also know your IP and if you are the fist to broadcast an xtn, like @kimmel (Pungo.io) says

[14-Oct-18 05:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
newest electrum, which most coins don't have, has more protections

[14-Oct-18 05:08 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
however electrum nodes can be protected to avoid 3rd party usage...or to accept only connection from certain ip's

[14-Oct-18 05:08 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
thats especially effective when using the mobile proxy

[14-Oct-18 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, please

[14-Oct-18 05:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
maintaining electrum code and servers is horrific and painful

[14-Oct-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can't keep in sync with upstream because they make massive backward-compatible-breaking changes

[14-Oct-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
merging in features/bugfixes is not fun

[14-Oct-18 05:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
and every client gui and backend server is slightly different, since electrumx changes the world sometimes

[14-Oct-18 05:11 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
right guess thats a good reason to avoid having open electrum hosts too

[14-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Mylo#8306
Does electrum server software come in a range of flavours or is it pretty much electrumx and that is it?

[14-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Mylo#8306
Is there a protocol spec?

if you can trust the merkleroot at a height, then you can validate a txproof that a specific rawtx was in that block

[14-Oct-18 05:12 PM] Mylo#8306
Yep thx found spec

[14-Oct-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
THAT is the only trust that is needed in electrum

[14-Oct-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so you can query N different sites for the merkle root of height X, make sure there is consensus

[14-Oct-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can verify that the rawtx indeed was in the block at the confidence level that not all the merkle roots were fake

[14-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok so u need a bit more work on the client to be “safe” by querying more servers

[14-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Mylo#8306
?

[14-Oct-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, it is less secure than a fullnode, but let us not go crazy about how insecure it is

[14-Oct-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
understand its weakness, which is that it needs to know the merkleroot of specific height

[14-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you can also just sync headers only via the p2p network and then be able to have confidence in the SPV

{Reactions}
🤔 🆒 

[14-Oct-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think what you describe could be implemented as a more secure/paranoid mode

[14-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
same as a full node

[14-Oct-18 05:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
it would actually be useful in a chainfork (BTC vs BCH) kind of deal

[14-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the best mix is to make a headers only full node, and then it does SPV validations for all tx

[14-Oct-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
then it wont need to get help from any external server

[14-Oct-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the breadwallet does this

{Reactions}
🤔 

[14-Oct-18 05:25 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no need for electrum hosts using the headers sync SPV client

[14-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
breadwallet connects to the actual p2p network

[14-Oct-18 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-relaying peer

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
syncs headers and thats it

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe occasionally sends a transaction

[14-Oct-18 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
we assume it is scanning incoming blocks and tracking its own transactions

[14-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[14-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
?

[14-Oct-18 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if a coin has no full nodes, then it isnt a real coin

[14-Oct-18 05:30 PM] jl777c#5810
let the mobile market run breadwallets

[14-Oct-18 05:30 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
if everybody runs protected electrum hosts, you just multiply the amount of full nodes

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
I mean relying on a single node doesnt has to be bad...while you are aware of it and while you cross check the results on explorers

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User if it is notarized, then at least 64 full nodes, not sure why you try to argue a silly position

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there will always be the miners

[14-Oct-18 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
and people that want to run a full node for any coin that is important enough
