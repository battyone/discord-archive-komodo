also, python has different ways of seeing if the key of a dict exists, and one way raises an exception and the other does not

[15-Aug-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
foo["bar"] will raise an exception if the key doesn't exist, but I believe foo.get("bar") will not, it returns undefined or something

[15-Aug-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
and i can't remember if it's the same in py2 and py3, but I think yes

```if 'bar' in foo:

Please help, the doc says there are language "wrapper" for KMD RPC  calls

[16-Aug-19 01:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
@miraculu which language you using?

[16-Aug-19 01:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
We have libraries for various languages like JS, Python, Go, and @grewalsatinder knows more than me

I know this isn't really a dICO, but there's a swiss company hoping to run an ICO adhering to KYC regulation, and have a few thousand dollars to put into a good ICO dashboard. I want to support komodo/the community so if it's possible to do (not really decentralized), would anyone be willing to give a quote? 
Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have 😄 Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).

[16-Aug-19 07:41 AM] Oszy#5734
@miraculu py pip has a komodorpc library, what lang do u need ?

[16-Aug-19 08:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
for py, in #kmdlabs  we've been mostly using slickRPC. By using the function here - https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/master/stakerlib.py#L15

you can define an rpc proxy like 
``` kmdrpc = def_credentials('KMD')
tokenrpc=def_credentials(token_name)```
then access methods like 
```kmdrpc.getinfo()
kmdrpc.sendtoaddress(address, amount)```
this also works for Antara modules - 
```tokenrpc.oraclessamples(oracletxid, batonutxo, str(numrec))
tokenrpc.tokencreate(str(tokenname), str(tokensupply), str(tokendesc))
```

@dukeleto and @Oszy am sorry for replying late, I need a c# wrapper and probably the JS wrapper too.

[17-Aug-19 11:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder don't we have all our lang wrappers listed somewhere? maybe @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator knows

[17-Aug-19 11:18 AM] dukeleto#7326

@CHMEX ^^^ shielded transaction and payment stats!!! I have a bug where it only calculates stats for blocks received since startup, so I need to figure that out, but it's getting close

[17-Aug-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
and i am keeping track of shielding/deshielding stats too, those aren't returned in json yet

[17-Aug-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i could use your advice

[17-Aug-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i am hacking on code which I think needs to change the serialization format of CBlockIndex

[17-Aug-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
never done that before, I know how to proceed, but I am wondering if there are things I should know. I assume my node will error and reindex if I don't remove my on-disk blocks

[17-Aug-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is related to keeping track of number of shielded xtns on current mainchain, which must be serialized to disk, and read back on startup

[17-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
why would you change the ondisk blockheader?

[17-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
pindex is an in memory structure, so it can be generated via whatever means

[17-Aug-19 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c `nTx`

[17-Aug-19 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the number of transactions seen, and it's serialized to disk

[17-Aug-19 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if i want to keep track of `nShieldedTx`, i need the same

[17-Aug-19 03:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
or else, my code only sees stuff since the last startup

[17-Aug-19 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am emulating the way `nTx` and `nChainTx` work

[17-Aug-19 03:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
and extending to shielded stuff

[17-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
this is area i havent changed, so not sure

[17-Aug-19 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i don't expect average nodes will enjoy a block index change on-disk, this is mostly a specialized feature. Maybe will live on a branch until the next mandatory update

[17-Aug-19 03:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
some BTC core updates do require block index refreshes, it's not unreasonable to do it sometimes

[17-Aug-19 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe we do it as part of the Q2 2020 hard fork update

[17-Aug-19 03:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX see, I knew this task was going to have fun little things like this 😉

[17-Aug-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
for now, just having some servers be able to get this data via a branch is fine

[17-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
why not just make a separate file that contains the data needed for this?

[17-Aug-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would be backward compatible

i guess this way seems "righter"

[17-Aug-19 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
using a diff file would be a bunch of code

[17-Aug-19 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe changing stuff is really dumb, which is why I am asking 🙂

[17-Aug-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
true. maybe this is a special -zindex=1 mode and would only affect nodes with that set

[17-Aug-19 03:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, that sounds smart

[17-Aug-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
then it wouldnt impact the normal nodes

[17-Aug-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes, I want to guard this with a CLI option, defaulted to OFF. keeping track of shielded stats does use resources

[17-Aug-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it slows down receiving blocks and loading blocks from disk, slightly, and uses more RAM

[17-Aug-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
just force a reindex if the -zindex value changes

[17-Aug-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
then it can be cleanly coded and still be backward compatible

[17-Aug-19 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds good, will try that
