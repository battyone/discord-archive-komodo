if i understand the code right all the sprout txns after dec 15 are groth16, right @jl777c ???

[07-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what it should be

[07-Jul-19 04:09 PM] radix42#3743
ok yeah then we can't merge that PR

[07-Jul-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
we could make a checkpoint at dec 15rth

[07-Jul-19 04:10 PM] radix42#3743
then we could ditch the OLD sprout files, that'd be kewl too

[07-Jul-19 04:12 PM] radix42#3743
I just jelly of HUSH who in their fork have managed to ditch them all

[07-Jul-19 04:12 PM] radix42#3743
since the HUSH3 chain has never seen a sprout txn

hello all

[07-Jul-19 04:43 PM] mk#2748
im kinda new to the komodo community.   I am running a Verus pool based on s-nomp, and I patched in some new features.  I was wondering if anybody here would be willing to review my work before I send a PR upstream

[07-Jul-19 04:43 PM] mk#2748
the enhancement is generic - all chains would benefit from it

[07-Jul-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
for VRSC pool related help, best to ask in #talk-mining or directly in Verus Discord https://discord.gg/JdD3JX

[07-Jul-19 04:44 PM] mk#2748
cool. .  im not actually asking for help.   im offering an enhancement to the pool software

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] mk#2748
looking for dev's to review my code

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] mk#2748
(fine, i guess that *is* asking for help)

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
best to post in Verus Discord

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] SHossain#0007
as that is the appropriate place

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] mk#2748
i happen to be running a verus pool, but this patch is generic to s-nomp for any coin

[07-Jul-19 04:45 PM] mk#2748
does s-nomp have their own discord somewhere?

[07-Jul-19 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
we don't manage s-nomp. pool ops in  mining channel might know more

[07-Jul-19 04:47 PM] mk#2748
i hereby request (one day) the addition of a dev-pools channel 😃

[07-Jul-19 04:47 PM] SHossain#0007
not trying to discourage you. just trying to help you by pointing to the right place

[07-Jul-19 04:47 PM] mk#2748
i appreciate it - thanks 😃

[07-Jul-19 04:48 PM] SHossain#0007
so, if your s-nomp patch is for general mining and if you ask in #talk-mining some ops and pool devs can look into it and review. that is the place for all  mining releated talks most of the time

[07-Jul-19 04:49 PM] mk#2748

[09-Jul-19 03:56 PM] CMaurice#1685
I made a mother of all docs EPUB for my own consumption by 'find'ing and 'cat'ing and 'pandoc':

```find docs/ -name '*.md' ! -name '*README*' -exec cat {} \; > moad.md```
or
```find komodo-api/ -name '*.md' ! -name '*README*' -exec cat {} \; > komodo-api.md```
for just the api docs, but don't do those without editing out the massive arse hex chunks in rawtransactions.md and blockchain.md first: I backtraced a segfault to libpcre choking on them.

then
```pandoc moad.md --toc -s -o moad.epub```
should get you an EPUB with toc for conversion and uploading with Calibre

This EPUB has no title, cover image, any prettiness and a very large toc, but it's good for me to skim and traverse while waiting for old ladies to do their shopping. I'll learn more about pandoc and prettifying over the next weeks, but questions: when might be a timeframe to aim for when the docs will settle a bit? Is this useful to anyone else?

[09-Jul-19 04:02 PM] gcharang#6833

if you want to be less stressfull in your linux environment, just use ubuntu 16.04 for solving many dependencies issues @Bernz - Selling LABS

shexy 

[10-Jul-19 07:58 AM] CMaurice#1685
Someone else seems to have had the problem... I think you might be cross-compiling in Debian in WSL for Windows, when probavly what you want to be doing is compiling in natively for Debian

[10-Jul-19 07:59 AM] CMaurice#1685
But I'm not sure what's happening here, anyone compiled komodo  under WSL?

(no answer in that link)

[10-Jul-19 12:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
Don't use WSL if you care about sanity

[10-Jul-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
use ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, in a VM if you have to

[10-Jul-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
any other OS or version will give great pains

[10-Jul-19 02:18 PM] CMaurice#1685
Ah well, good advice@Bernz - Selling LABS ^ points for trying though

[10-Jul-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
@Bernz - Selling LABS if you have some time to debug, you could setup pos64staker natively in windows

[10-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
basically you just need to figure out how to install all the dependencies and it should "just work"

[10-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Im currently attempting what duke suggested

[10-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I couldnt finish installing dependencies on just windows I recieved the error above

[10-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
you're using the subsystem thing in that error, no?

[10-Jul-19 07:38 PM] Alright#0419
by "natively in windows" I mean not using linux VM or subsystem at all

[10-Jul-19 07:38 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
wsl ye

[10-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
what im doing is already way above my level of understanding so anyway to simplify it as much as possible would be nice lol

[10-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
when I wrote the pos64staker stuff I made sure to try to keep it compatible with osx windows and linux, but I haven't had an opportunity to try it on osx or windows yet

[10-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
need to install python 3.6 or greater then a couple pip packages and it should work fine

[10-Jul-19 07:40 PM] Alright#0419
but again, it likely needs some debugging

[10-Jul-19 07:42 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I couldnt figure out how to install python on windows, when I did wget it told me the certificate wasnt trusted/no known issuer and I dont know how to override that

yea, sorry I wouldn't know where to start tbh

[10-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Alright#0419
I'd just be googling it all myself

[10-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I have been, must not be looking hard enough, if I cant get this to work through a VM ill go back to windows and figure out how to get python in

[10-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
I'll buy a windows machine I guess 😫

[10-Jul-19 07:46 PM] Alright#0419
I was just desperately hoping someone would have tried it by now 😂

[10-Jul-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
does anyone understand how the `-pubkey=` address interacts with the keypool? I assumed it having -pubkey set would make requesting an address from the keypool return that address every time, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

https://github.com/Alrighttt/komodo/commit/ce29e267424737c9afa70e1c03314c7c8565ff68

trying to get this to use an address from keypool if `-pubkey=` is not set and use the `-pubkey=` address if it is, but currently it always grabs the next address from the keypool and won't use `-pubkey=` address no matter what

@Alright not sure, maybe ask your question more specifically

[11-Jul-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
what bit of code is not doing what you expect? what is it doing?

[11-Jul-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I have never dealt with -pubkey + keypool interactions

[11-Jul-19 02:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think maybe he was tryng to change that op_returnburn RPC so that it just uses the normal wallet. I think it needs to be re written for that. It was just a helper RPC I made for creating `-eartlytxid` chains. I think I can make it do what he says, but I'll wait until hes around to make sure before I do anything there.

that assertion error message is pretty lame

[11-Jul-19 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r @dukeleto I rewrote the `opreturn_burn` rpc as previously it required EVAL_ORACLES to be active on the chain. I rewrote it to use an address from the keypool for the change. It works, but I assumed setting `-pubkey=` would make it automatically use the `-pubkey=` address always. Even if `-pubkey=` is set, it still grabs the next address from the keypool

[11-Jul-19 07:31 PM] Alright#0419
which i find really confusing because I based it on how `sendtoaddress` get it's change addresses, but `sendtoaddress` will send change to `-pubkey=` address if it's set

[11-Jul-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
it works fine as is, just wondering how the hell sentoaddress knows to use `-pubkey=` address for change if it's set

Hi, do you guys know where I can find all the info for how DPoW works under the hood?
The process I am struggling to understand is how Bitcoins ledger and Komodos + third party ledgers are being combined together in an immutable way
If any one can explain this or point to the info that would be very useful. Thanks
