The 13 chosen notary nodes vary for each notarization.

[12-Sep-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The notary nodes wouldn't write "wrong" information to BTC.

Whatever they write, that's the history, and the whole network (asset chains, etc.) just moves forward from there.

[12-Sep-18 12:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If what we might call "bad data" gets into a notarization -- i.e. your asset chain gets hacked, or someone does something so egregious that all your users are upset and want to go back -- you can rollback your own chain to whatever time you want with a hard fork, and resume the notarization process.

[12-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Likewise, if the users don't like what the blockchain developers are doing, and assuming they're operating with open-source philosophy, the users can hard fork and split however they desire, and start notarizing at whatever block height they desire.

[12-Sep-18 12:47 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does that answer your question?

[12-Sep-18 12:52 AM] joey#9690
I think so, yes, although I'll have to do some research on my own to see how it works. I'm wondering what happens in the event of a reorganization, where 10 or 20 blocks are reorged on the chain, and the notarization nodes put that into the KMD/BTC blocks

[12-Sep-18 12:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Any attempt to reorganize the chain before the last notarization is simply ignored.

During the period between the last notarization and the present moment, that's where your consensus mechanism is still in play.

If you're worried about someone maliciously attacking your blockchain during the ten/twenty minutes since the last notarization, you just need to decide what style of chain you want.

You can make a KMD-based chain have any percentage you choose of PoW vs PoS.

One of the chains in our system, Verus, uses a hybrid between PoS and PoW, for this reason. I think they even wrote some of the underyling code for it, but I'm not sure.

[12-Sep-18 01:00 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you're worried about a lot of miners attacking your chain, and if you want to have people have confirmations that they can at least act on faster, then use a good chunk of PoS in your setup.

On the other hand, having at least some of the PoW method available in your consensus mechanism will allow you to ensure that anyone can mine a block. This curtails censorship, and other issues.

If you're not worried about a time delay, best to keep your chain primarily PoW.

[12-Sep-18 01:07 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@joey Let me know if you have more questions.

If you haven't had a chance yet, read part I of the white paper. It's about 30 pages, and goes into thorough detail.

@Alright 

I have not yet received a successful response using `kvsearch`

[12-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, right, I haven't done any block generations...

[12-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let's do that then...

[12-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm guessing this is why the other command also wasn't working.

[12-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

I was able to get all of that to work.

How much is the cost for a KV transaction?

It stores it in the transaction using OP_RETURN, correct?

[12-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
I believe it depends on the length of the value

[12-Sep-18 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
yes, it stores the data in OP_RETURN

[12-Sep-18 01:28 AM] joey#9690
@Bryan_Beus had to go do something in real life. My use-case is a PoW chain and I want to add notarized blocks into KMD (and Bitcoin)

[12-Sep-18 01:28 AM] joey#9690
PoS is not an option

[12-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok

[12-Sep-18 01:29 AM] joey#9690
What does this mean exactly?
> Any attempt to reorganize the chain before the last notarization is simply ignored.

[12-Sep-18 01:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, you can just use KMD, without BTC, if you want to save money, but if you want to use BTC as well, you're welcome to.

[12-Sep-18 01:29 AM] joey#9690
That makes sense

[12-Sep-18 01:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, the way it works is that a KMD-based coin daemon will let the consensus mechanism just run according to the rules.

If it's PoW, then it's PoW.

... until...

a notarization occurs.

Once it occurs, the coin daemon considers everything that came before the notarization to be resolved history, beyond contestation.

The public keys of the notary nodes are able to write data to the blockchain that the whole chain recognizes as the ultimate decider of history.

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Alright#0419
Hey sidd, did kvupdate work properly once you started mining blocks

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, your users can compete for blocks during the ten to 20 minutes or so while you wait for a notarization, but once that notarization occurs, the history is settled, and everyone moves on to the next chunk.

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright Yes, thank you!

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Alright#0419
just made that PR, should I test that?

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] joey#9690
Ah, yeah, I'm talking about a PoW chain that isn't a KMD sub-asset. Sorry

[12-Sep-18 01:32 AM] Alright#0419

[12-Sep-18 01:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@joey 

Ya, if you're not using a KMD sub asset, and you want to use KMD's notary nodes, then you need to talk with @dukeleto

[12-Sep-18 01:33 AM] joey#9690
We had a long chat earlier. Just trying to learn more

[12-Sep-18 01:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, let's chat tomorrow. feel free to hit me up. Sorry if I misunderstood what you were asking.

[12-Sep-18 01:34 AM] joey#9690
No problem, it's complex

[12-Sep-18 04:34 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

Can you give me any specifics about cost for a KV update transaction? 

This seems like something developers would want to know.

(Also, in marketing, we're going to be building real-time cost calculations soon.)

[12-Sep-18 04:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Can you help me with these entries, please?

```
minerids needs height
---------------------

``COMING SOON``

notaries height timestamp
-------------------------

``COMING SOON``

```

Need a description of the method, of each of its parameters, and an example of entering it into the command prompt.

If it requires a special setup (meaning, if I can't do it on my regtest asset chain), then I also need a copy/paste of a response.

[12-Sep-18 04:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, here in ``getblocksubsidy``, I see a section about a founder's reward.

This sounds like something leftover from the Zcash team?

```

getblocksubsidy
---------------

::

  getblocksubsidy height_number

The ``getblocksubsidy`` method returns the block-subsidy reward. The resulting calculation takes into account the mining slow start and the founders reward, of block at index provided.
```

How would we change this for KMD? Is there anything we'd need to indicate about how our rewards are calculated -- perhaps the 5% reward?

[12-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright

@jl777c 

In this here,

```
minerids needs height
---------------------
```

what does needs stand for? 

I assume height stands for block height.

Are these numbers, strings, booleans, or something else?

Do they need to be submitted as a JSON object, or are they submitted as standalone inputs?

[12-Sep-18 11:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright What's the maximum length of a kvupdate value?

[12-Sep-18 11:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

So, with some trial and error I find that I only need to submit the height for `minerids`.

I'm assuming the `needs` thing was put there by accident?

Also, in the response I receive, I see that inside the `miners` array there are 64 objects for notary nodes, and then one additional object that has 
```
{
        "pubkey": "external miners",
        "blocks": 541
}
```
Can you tell me about this object?

Also, in the notary node objects, I see that there's a `blocks` property as well. I believe these properties are related? Can you tell me about this as well?

```
{
      "notaryid": 59,
      "KMDaddress": "RWk4WLiAv6MKWLozJbj1jyhayKtjwbtX7M",
      "pubkey": "029d19215440d8cb9cc6c6b7a4744ae7fb9fb18d986e371b06aeb34b64845f9325",

What type of business do you have?

[13-Sep-18 01:52 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

When you're on an asset chain, the other person just needs to also be running the same new coin daemon (which you just created) on their computer.

Since you don't have a GUI software wallet for it, yet (though you may be able to integrate with our Agama wallet), the other person just needs to enter this into their command prompt (I'm typing for Linux, if you need MacOS or Win, lmk)

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIKAFFYCOIN getnewaddress
```
That will create a new address for them.

They tell you what address they have, and then you send them money from your machine by going like this
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIKAFFYCOIN sendtoaddress "YOURFRIENDSADDRESS" amount_number
```
That's it, for the command prompt.

If you decide to integrate with Agama, then you'll have software to make it easier.
