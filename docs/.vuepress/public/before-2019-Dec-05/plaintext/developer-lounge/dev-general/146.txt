The most difficult issue about oracles is that they need to be trusted to various degree to provide accurate and timely data. The danger is that if a trusted node is used to write data to the blockchain, it creates a trust point and a single point of attack. Ultimately there is nothing that can ensure only valid data is written to the blockchain, so what is done is to reinforce good behavior via pay per datapoint. However, for critical data, higher level processing is needed that combines multiple data providers into a validated signal.

Your system is centralized as it can get.  You alone can dictate "truth" with your "hard updates". Before you say "miners decide" let me ask,  who decides which fork exchange run?

[22-Mar-19 08:44 PM] zack#6467
implying that it is trustless if it is not trustless, and then seeking investment from people who you have mislead, I consider that lying.

[22-Mar-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
how are we claiming trustless oracles with paragraph like that

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] zack#6467

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont imply it is trustless, we say it requires trust and we are using the standard definition of oracles

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] MyName#0491
@zack By all means, explain to me how you expect folks to *not* "fixating on the definition of the word oracle" when you started this by literally saying `Advertising it as if it was an oracle is a lie.`...

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Regnar#6164
I posted that link already

[22-Mar-19 08:45 PM] zack#6467
saying "nothing can ensure only valid data is written to the blockchain" is pretty bold.
You are saying that Augur, Bitcoin Hivemind, and Amoveo are all broken

[22-Mar-19 08:46 PM] benohanlon#1119
@zack would you be interested in doing a comparison chart like this of oracle tech etc... https://twitter.com/blockdata_tech/status/1108756379672678401?

Didnt augur have some oracles with the wrong values?

[22-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Regnar#6164
If the data written to the chain was truly valid, they wouldn't need "wisdom of the crowd" to verify it's valid

[22-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Regnar#6164
So no, Augur isn't broken

You claim is that calling it an "oracle" is a "lie"; logic dictates that the definition of "oracle" must then be established in order to support/refute your claim

claiming Augur isn't a perfect implementation of their goal, and claiming that Augur is seeking an impossible goal are very different claims. @jl777c

[22-Mar-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but where in there are we claiming oracles CC is trustless??

[22-Mar-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
there is always the extreme edge case, even in your system

[22-Mar-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I stand by my position, which you also have with the hardfork as backup in place

[22-Mar-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so far from advertising oracles CC is trustless, our position is more that some amount of trust will likely be needed for offchain data coming onchain

[22-Mar-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so the issue is how to best manage it

[22-Mar-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime, there is oracles CC to create a datafee market where data publishers can get subscribers to pay to post data onchain, without any betting involved

[22-Mar-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so the creation . of accurate data becomes possible, even without big money at stake

[22-Mar-19 08:51 PM] Regnar#6164
Augur isn't claiming to ensure only valid data is written, its claiming to build a system to determine what data is valid and which isn't. If ONLY valid data could be written then there would be no reason to build a system to have crowds validate the data...

[22-Mar-19 08:51 PM] zack#6467
anying that is on a blockchain is trustless from the investor's perspective, because the only reason to put it onto a blockchain is to make it trustless.
If it is not trustless, you need to go out of your way to  make that clear when advertising it.

[22-Mar-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that paragraphs achieves what you claim is needed

[22-Mar-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
your claim that we are lying is a lie

[22-Mar-19 08:52 PM] zack#6467
if you are claiming that "some amount of trust is needed", then you cannot also claim it is trustless.

[22-Mar-19 08:52 PM] MyName#0491
`because the only reason to put it onto a blockchain is to make it trustless.`
That's a subjective opinion, not an objective fact

[22-Mar-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
sigh.. are you really this obtuse?

[22-Mar-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
I do not see where we claim it is trustless

[22-Mar-19 08:52 PM] zack#6467
To the best of my knowledge, Amoveo's oracle is in fact trustless. I could be mistaken, but I still speak honestly.

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a paragraph being very clear

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the oracle might be trustless, but reliance on hardforking requires trust

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] benohanlon#1119
@zack but it's your assertion that if it isn't trustless it's not fit for blockchain that's at the core of your arguement

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] zack#6467
Advertising that "Komodo has blockchain oracles" is a lie. it has blockchain trusted feeds.

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] benohanlon#1119
whereas utility might be a good reason for an oracle that is trustful

[22-Mar-19 08:53 PM] MyName#0491
`To the best of my knowledge, Amoveo's oracle is in fact trustless.`
That you can/will manually manipulate it for money is the exact opposite of trustless

`I cannot manipulate Amoveo. My relationship is the same as any other users's.`
OK, then I got confused, what chain is the one that you are capable of doing manual "hard updates" on?

[22-Mar-19 08:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the game theory is that data providers will provide good data if they want to keep getting subscribers

[22-Mar-19 08:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
the person who tells exchanges to use git repo X  and branch Y for Amoveo is trusted

[22-Mar-19 08:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
is what people are getting at @zack

[22-Mar-19 08:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so your claim that we are lying is a lie

lies, damn lies, and oracles

[22-Mar-19 08:57 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c  that isn't secure against retirement attacks, so it is not trustless.

if there is a data publisher, you can trust that he published it

[22-Mar-19 08:58 PM] zack#6467
There are fully trustless oracles. Augur, Amoveo, Bitcoin Hivemind

Augur, hivemind, maybe

[22-Mar-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
augur had oracles with wrong conclusions

[22-Mar-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure about hivemind

[22-Mar-19 08:58 PM] zack#6467
Saying that Augur has an implementation flaw, and that Augur's goal is impossible, those are very different claims.

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, but dont conflate the issues

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a separate issue

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] zack#6467
trustlessness isn't some impossible goal. It is just math.

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
are we saying we have trustless oracles or are we saying nobody can make them 100% reliably

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
or that more extreme measures are needed

[22-Mar-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt a 100% statement

[22-Mar-19 09:00 PM] MyName#0491
`There are fully trustless oracles... Amoveo`
You've literally said that you'll manually "hard update" to mark an oracle "about to lie", which (by definition) makes it "trusted" not "trustless"
One must trust that such "hard updates" are not maliciously altered

"oracles CC allows offchain data to go onchain and then other CC can use that data to change behavior"
This statement right here.
You aren't really allowing off-chain data to go onchain.
Instead you are trusting some person to put some data that may or may not be related to reality onto the blockchain.

[22-Mar-19 09:07 PM] zack#6467
There is no cryptoeconomic guarantees that the data on-chain has any relationship to reality.
