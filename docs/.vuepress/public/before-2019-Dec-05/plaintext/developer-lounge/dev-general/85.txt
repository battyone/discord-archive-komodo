yes its not running its stopped

[16-Dec-18 07:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai ill start with komodo

[16-Dec-18 07:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and then do -zapwallettxs

[16-Dec-18 07:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
do i need to use the command of sapling ?

[16-Dec-18 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should work, if it does not, sapling didnt activate and it might refuse ... you may need to sync a node and it will sync until spaling activates, and from there the rest of the chain will be invalid and you start mining from that block and discard the other chains.

[16-Dec-18 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I have no idea... juts try it

[16-Dec-18 07:13 AM] D.rabbani#9094

updation

[16-Dec-18 08:04 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 08:04 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so if i can update in two staking nodes first ?

[16-Dec-18 08:04 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the komodo

[16-Dec-18 08:04 AM] D.rabbani#9094
will it be fine

[16-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[16-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just dont start staking

[16-Dec-18 08:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
until you update them all

[16-Dec-18 08:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 09:15 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  its still updating

[16-Dec-18 10:06 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright  it says compilation terminated ?

[16-Dec-18 10:06 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 10:06 AM] Alright#0419
post the output here or pastebin

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
this is the errror i got ?

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i start again

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
try `git clean -f` then `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` again

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i directly do git clean -f ?

[16-Dec-18 10:07 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like now ?

[16-Dec-18 10:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
or

[16-Dec-18 10:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
??

[16-Dec-18 10:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
shall i run this

[16-Dec-18 10:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont need to do git reset hard ?

[16-Dec-18 10:08 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again

[16-Dec-18 10:12 AM] D.rabbani#9094
its still showing compilation terminated

[16-Dec-18 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure how you got to this point. Best bet would be to delete the entire directory and clone a fresh version from it

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai and if i run my previous cli commands on that will it work fine ? right with new update version ?

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the process is going on now

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
again

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
lets see

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i forgot to inclide the j -8

[16-Dec-18 10:14 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because using 8 cores

[16-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
ping me if you have any issuess

[16-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
but I'd recommend deleting the entire directory and doing `git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo` again

[16-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Alright#0419
and starting from there

[16-Dec-18 10:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[16-Dec-18 10:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks

[16-Dec-18 10:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill do it if its not successfull

[16-Dec-18 10:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 10:22 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai i got this thanks alot

[16-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
`git clean -f` fixed it?

[16-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
or fresh clone?

[16-Dec-18 10:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
git clean -f fixed it üòÉ

[16-Dec-18 10:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I've been experimenting with low level math surrounding key generation. This has me quite stumped though. This is based on logic here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format
Seems to me I should be able to just change `BC` in this script and be able to convert KMD WIFs to any other network's WIF format, but it only works if I do KMD -> KMD? ü§î

Wallet import format

[16-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Alright#0419
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import hashlib
import base58
import binascii

private_key_WIF = input("WIF: ")

first_encode = base58.b58decode(private_key_WIF)

private_key_full = binascii.hexlify(first_encode)
#print(private_key_full)
private_key = private_key_full[2:-8]

print(private_key.decode("utf-8"))
#print(binascii.hexlify(private_key))


private_key_static = private_key.decode("utf-8")
print('static',private_key_static)
extended_key = "BC"+private_key_static
first_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(extended_key)).hexdigest()
second_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(first_sha256)).hexdigest()

# add checksum to end of extended key
final_key = extended_key+second_sha256[:8]

# Wallet Import Format = base 58 encoded final_key
WIF = base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(final_key))

print (WIF.decode("utf-8"))
```
Any advice?

[16-Dec-18 10:41 AM] Alright#0419
If I input a KMD WIF, the final result is the same WIF I inputted. Which to me, makes it seems like it should work if I change the prefix

[16-Dec-18 10:41 AM] Alright#0419
changing the prefix makes it just output garbage though

[16-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
extended_key = "BC"+private_key_static
for BTC it is 80 instead of BC

[16-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
iguana has C code that does all this

[16-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
when I change it to 80 and input KMD WIF, I get something like this `L4oNTzSTr5CyTtU7MFGQKoTUoS9Hcwgv6nK5pjrbK42qBeopQR9a`

[16-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
Surely, just something I'm not seeing, I've gone over each step over and over though :/

[16-Dec-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC privkeys start with K or L if I remember right

[16-Dec-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so what is wrong?

[16-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
üòÑ

[16-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
it's compressed vs uncompressed

it says that privkey is not on the curve though

[16-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Alright#0419
that site is expecting compressed it seems, converted it and it's fine

[16-Dec-18 11:11 AM] Alright#0419
ok maybe this is a stupid question, but do all private keys have 2 addresses associated with them? The one corresponding to compressed WIF and the other corresponding to uncompressed?

[16-Dec-18 11:12 AM] jorian#4555
1 private key can lead to 2 addresses yes

[16-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

hi is it not necesaary to stop daemon for sapling right?

[16-Dec-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
If you have Komodo daemon running, you can keep it running while updating if your machine has the sufficient processing power. If you prefer to stop it before updating, please use

[16-Dec-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[16-Dec-18 11:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like its optional right ?

[16-Dec-18 11:53 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
you need to restart after update nomatter what - but you can stop before if you want

[16-Dec-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai we need to restart after the update

[16-Dec-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 11:55 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
on a low spec machine - update will be faster if you stop first

the only thing i needed to know that stopping cli is not neccessary if ill do it will be for my benefit
