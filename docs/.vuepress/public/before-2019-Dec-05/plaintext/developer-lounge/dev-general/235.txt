@Slyris yes, I tried and understood the helper C code you made with demo2 folder test I did with the repo  link I gave.

[13-Nov-19 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I did use big int x, and removed it before pushing code and disabling the C line

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Usually if you can compile the libnspv in a static library

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my goal is to call the libbtc and libcryptoconditions functions and calls in go

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] Slyris#2880
you should be able to just run the lunch function no ?

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ah

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok, i was thinking that your goal is just reproduce the nspv command line tool

[13-Nov-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope just aiming for the first most basic thing üòÅ

[13-Nov-19 08:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then would like to do what nspv is doing.... even if I could attempt to do it

[13-Nov-19 08:11 AM] Slyris#2880
You should start with something more easy then

[13-Nov-19 08:11 AM] Slyris#2880
Did you read carefully: https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/ ?

https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/
cgo - The Go Programming Language
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

[13-Nov-19 08:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I watched a tutorial and read bunch other tutorials.... went through it, but didn't read it full.

[13-Nov-19 08:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally what you want is create in C a function that run everything that you need from libnspv, and call this function from Golang

[13-Nov-19 08:13 AM] Slyris#2880
The best things is to create a function that take the argument of the command line and forward it to libnspv

[13-Nov-19 08:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ü§î good thought

[13-Nov-19 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like making a .c/.h file in libnspv which is calling/using libnspv code and doing events etc.
and call this compiled .c code and header in my golang code and perform actions?

[13-Nov-19 08:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that what you meant @Slyris

[13-Nov-19 08:16 AM] Slyris#2880
But to be honest you have to be careful, cgo does not keep all its promises in golang and disables the most interesting features of languages

[13-Nov-19 08:17 AM] Slyris#2880
@grewalsatinder Yeah it's was i mean

[13-Nov-19 08:17 AM] Slyris#2880
For example a super interesting thing in golang is the cross building, it is disabled with the use of cgo, ie no android, no ios and if unix system functions, no windows anymore...

[13-Nov-19 08:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, thanks for confirming. yep, heard some things of performance not so optimal with cgo as with just pure go and pure C.
will keep that in mind.

[13-Nov-19 08:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Mean's that finally waiting for @Sir Seven Cross compat build will be a better idea at the end, he is working on giving nspv binary for every platform already build

[13-Nov-19 08:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay mate. thanks for giving me some direction. üëç

[13-Nov-19 08:20 AM] Slyris#2880
In fact if you want, what would be great is to have the strict equivalent of libnspv written entirely in golang, the problem is that it would require double maintenance. By that it should follow the updates of libnspv in C of jl777 and reproducires without error in golang. Not worth.

[13-Nov-19 08:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[13-Nov-19 08:21 AM] Slyris#2880
I am personally working on a nspv system in C++. My program downloads the latest version of nspv according to the platform, starts the process and communicates in rpc with.

[13-Nov-19 08:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can also make a go code using libnspv's rpc, can indeed also go for making gRPC for libnspv.
but that would mean running the `./nspv` binary and using it's RPC API calls.

[13-Nov-19 08:27 AM] Slyris#2880
I discussed it with @ca333 yesterday in DM, that's not a good idea because it's add an external layers.

He is right to say that every langage have now great http library to communicate with rpc binaries

[13-Nov-19 08:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, true that

[13-Nov-19 08:27 AM] Slyris#2880
Even i agree too that gRPC api is more easy to use than raw http stuff

[13-Nov-19 08:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Because in this way You download a Golang microservices that download nspv and start the process make 2 process for just calling rpc stuff

[13-Nov-19 08:28 AM] Slyris#2880
It's a performance penalty

[13-Nov-19 08:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ultimate thing I want to see is the ability to code cryptoconditions code in go.

[13-Nov-19 08:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and how to achieve it, that looks tough battle

[13-Nov-19 08:29 AM] Slyris#2880
You will need to start from something like: https://github.com/renproject/libbtc-go

implement nspv on that yourself etc

do you tell me which wallet support smart contracts

[17-Nov-19 06:22 PM] pandaanu73#7907
for komodo

[17-Nov-19 06:27 PM] Oszy#5734
latest komodo ocean should support most of them

[17-Nov-19 06:30 PM] pandaanu73#7907
can i fork it for my smart chain

[17-Nov-19 06:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes of course

my smart chain is support smart contract but how to make smart contract do any wallet or web app created like ethereum and xlm.

[17-Nov-19 06:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
you need to code the cc and than make it so it works with spv.

[17-Nov-19 06:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
there is no tutorial for that as far as I know as cc via spv has not been done yet

[17-Nov-19 06:42 PM] pandaanu73#7907
komodo supports smart contract

[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
there are a few yes like rewards ccdice lotto etc. If you need a specific one you need to code it

[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
need to issue cli calls as neede

[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810

[17-Nov-19 06:45 PM] pandaanu73#7907
ok

[17-Nov-19 06:45 PM] pandaanu73#7907
