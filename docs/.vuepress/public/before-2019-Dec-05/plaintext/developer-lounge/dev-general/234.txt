@Mylo have you done a ubuntu/arch package comparison?

No.  Just seems to have less bloat (KDE) and modern hardware support, latest kernel.
It‚Äôs like gentoo without the headaches :abusedsmily:

[06-Nov-19 11:00 AM] Lumbi#8378
Manjaro is also making strides, but Arch Komodo would be cool to have.

if it says `isvalid: true`, then it is a valid komodo address

[07-Nov-19 07:07 AM] Oszy#5734
`getnewaddress ` gives you transparent address
`z_getnewaddress ` gives you shielded private address

[07-Nov-19 07:08 AM] Oszy#5734
z_getnewaddress for ARRR

[07-Nov-19 09:18 AM] Oszy#5734
rpcallowip is only needed if you want to allow the client/daemon to accept RPC connections outside the localhost.
in that case enter correct IP or don't use rpcallowip at all

[07-Nov-19 09:19 AM] Oszy#5734
and add 
`server=1
daemon=1` to your config

[07-Nov-19 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
also add 
`rpcbind=127.0.0.1`

i use this 127.0.0.1 , it return result

[07-Nov-19 09:31 AM] gcharang#6833
@lc123456 it is not a good security practice to access your daemon from another server
but, if you need to do it for testing purposes,
add rpcallowip=your_remote_ip and remove rpcbind=127.0.0.1 from your conf

[07-Nov-19 09:32 AM] lc123456#5516
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0

let me try it

[07-Nov-19 09:34 AM] gcharang#6833
if that doesn't work, use the exact ip of your remote server

[07-Nov-19 09:34 AM] lc123456#5516
add rpcbind?

[07-Nov-19 09:35 AM] gcharang#6833
no
remove rpcbind if it is already present

[07-Nov-19 09:36 AM] lc123456#5516
rpcallowip point one ip ?

[07-Nov-19 09:36 AM] gcharang#6833
try 0.0.0.0/0
if that doesn't work, try one ip

[07-Nov-19 09:36 AM] lc123456#5516
ok

[07-Nov-19 09:37 AM] gcharang#6833
just make sure you don't and will never have actual coins on this node

[07-Nov-19 09:37 AM] lc123456#5516
why

[07-Nov-19 09:37 AM] lc123456#5516
i has  many coin

[07-Nov-19 09:40 AM] gcharang#6833
allowing remote clients to issue rpc calls is not secure
so, it is not recommended
why are you trying to send rpc commands from one server to another?

[07-Nov-19 09:43 AM] lc123456#5516
0.0.0.0/0  this can

[07-Nov-19 09:45 AM] gcharang#6833
is it working?
it will essentially allow any computer on the internet to try and guess your rpcuser and rpcpassword
if you have coins on the node, they can be stolen

can you answer this question?
```
why are you trying to send rpc commands from one server to another?
```

[07-Nov-19 09:48 AM] gcharang#6833
if you are familiar with ssh, you can use it to securely send commands
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/64yorp/rpc_over_internet_how_to_secureencrypt_the/dg6xgxt/>
```
ssh -i /path/to/your/ssh_key.pem -f <USER>@<SERVER_IP> -L 7771:127.0.0.1:7771 -N
```

[07-Nov-19 10:10 AM] lc123456#5516
yes

[07-Nov-19 10:10 AM] lc123456#5516
this is my test env

[07-Nov-19 10:13 AM] gcharang#6833
did you understand how to use ssh to securely issue the commands?

`komodod: error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`

Am getting this after building komodod(and trying to launch it) inside a docker container. Has anyone ever seen something similar? Possible this lib is dynamically linked? Seems that way, yes?

[08-Nov-19 09:54 PM] Oszy#5734
yes i have seen it today on my 2nd machine

[08-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Oszy#5734
which has the exact copy of the first machine's komodo folder, even rebuilt it, still same as your error

how to search send coin number by txid in arrr

[12-Nov-19 07:21 AM] lc123456#5516
@Oszy

[12-Nov-19 07:24 AM] Oszy#5734
You can't. You have to log every tx yourself when sending, `op-id` and `amount`

[12-Nov-19 09:16 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`how to search send coin number by txid in arrr`
@lc123456 you can use
`z_viewtransaction theTXID`

[12-Nov-19 09:17 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
if it was your transaction

[12-Nov-19 10:16 AM] lc123456#5516
z_viewtransaction  not this method

`we use arrr api frequent timeouts`
clean stale transactions more often

[12-Nov-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just getrawtransaction with txid will return info about a txid

was exploring Go <-> C code yesterday.
able to compile/build my test go code with libnspv's libbtc.a, libcryptocoditions.a with include headers to my go test code.
I next tried to use function from base58 and couldn't make it work. Still don't have full understanding of cgo code and stuff.

the header file is included in the go comments
