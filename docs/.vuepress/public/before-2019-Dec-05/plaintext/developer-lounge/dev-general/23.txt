[14-Sep-18 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus there doesn't seem to be a parse error with the createrawtransaction example

[14-Sep-18 03:23 PM] Alright#0419
can you show me what error you were getting?

[14-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
Also, my `help createrawtransaction` is showing something different than your's it seems

[14-Sep-18 03:29 PM] Alright#0419
which branch of komodod are you using?

[14-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
can someone explain to me when `invalidateblock` would ever actually be useful?

[14-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
I understand what it does, but I don't understand the situation where it would be used

[14-Sep-18 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
when your node goes on a fork and you dont want to be on that fork, invalidate the first block of the fork

[14-Sep-18 06:22 PM] Mylo#8306
can that be used as a way to "delete blocks" to try and get back onto main chain?

[14-Sep-18 06:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds like a way that you can manually try to go onto a known good chain, before waiting 100 blocks until reorganization rule kicks in

[14-Sep-18 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[14-Sep-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
given a known fork, just invalidate its first block and nodes wont follow it

[14-Sep-18 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
@dukeleto why is that 100 block reorg rule a thing?

[14-Sep-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
just a hardcoded limit inherited from zcash

[14-Sep-18 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe they inherited from bitcoin

[14-Sep-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
Maybe do away with that?

[14-Sep-18 06:52 PM] Alright#0419
not the warning, but the shutting node down

[14-Sep-18 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
why?

[14-Sep-18 06:53 PM] Alright#0419
it shuts down the network pretty much

[14-Sep-18 06:53 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i guess both good and bad nodes shutdown?

[14-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
yea it shuts down honest nodes

[14-Sep-18 06:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, remove it and see what happens

[14-Sep-18 06:54 PM] Alright#0419
👌

[14-Sep-18 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
I think not allowing it to reorg would be a good thing, but shutting down the node is a bad thing

[14-Sep-18 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
An honest 100 block reorg isn't likely. The only reason that would happen is if there is serious problems with the network

[14-Sep-18 06:58 PM] Alright#0419
not allowing it to reorg will cause a fork, but it's very unlikely to happen without a bad actor doing it purposefully

[14-Sep-18 10:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto 

To crash the chain, I just did the command:

```
curl --user user138763741:pass5ff9f6434ed6405b884fc24ee41e590a64fcf163ee9f9c44e973124935aed7a9fc     --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "invalidateblock", "params": ["02f51fb2793b0728050c5e983ffed669594e0a2dda01dcb7a68d129fd87436e0"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:9801/ | jq
```

I put a .txt file above that has a bunch of garbled gibberish that came out of the `regtest` daemon after some time. You can see it linked above.

[14-Sep-18 10:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

I took the curl example from `help createrawtransaction`, substituted my new `regtest` change's rpc username, port, and password, substituted a known txid, and submitted. Here's the response:

```

[14-Sep-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
should replace `address` with an actual address

[14-Sep-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
but i don't think that's the problem actually

[14-Sep-18 10:35 PM] Alright#0419
also, are you saying that regtest is showing different help docs?

[14-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
what's the benefit of using regtest as opposed to just creating your own asset chain?

[14-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Alright#0419
if there are major differences between regtest and an asset chain, it'd be best to test all of this on asset chains

[14-Sep-18 10:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
no, to get the example, I just typed in `komodo-cli help createrawtransaction`, so that should be the normal example

[14-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
what build of komodod are you on

[14-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Alright#0419
paste the example here please

[14-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The regtest one I just use for somethings. I use KMD for others. 

I'd like to make my own asset chain, but I haven't done it before, and it might (?) slow me down. 

I will be going into the documentation for asset chains soon, and doing the same thing, so very soon I should be familiar with create them.

[14-Sep-18 10:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Mmm, one sec and I'll get it...

[14-Sep-18 10:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
Examples
> komodo-cli createrawtransaction "[{\"txid\":\"myid\",\"vout\":0}]" "{\"address\":0.01}"
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "createrawtransaction", "params": ["[{\"txid\":\"myid\",\"vout\":0}]", "{\"address\":0.01}"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```

[14-Sep-18 10:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm using the KMD build that comes pre-installed with agama.

```
siddhartha@aang:/opt/AgamaApp/resources/app/assets/bin/linux64$ 
```

[14-Sep-18 10:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
that's the dir

[14-Sep-18 10:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We took the CLI wallet off of the downloads page on komodoplatform.com, and I'm not sure where I'd download the full KMD build from.

[14-Sep-18 10:39 PM] Alright#0419
ok, I was confused before because you had extra `'`s

[14-Sep-18 10:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, I think I may have tried a few things and got mixed up. 

But I'm still getting the same error. Let me try without the `address` issue.

[14-Sep-18 10:40 PM] Alright#0419
does taking the quotes away from around `{\"address\":0.01}` work?

[14-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
that needs to be an address btw

[14-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
`{\"<kmdaddress>\":0.01}`

[14-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
not the quotes inside of it btw

[14-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Alright#0419
make `"{\"address\":0.01}"` just `{\"address\":0.01}`

[14-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
this is like the 4th one we've found

[14-Sep-18 11:13 PM] Alright#0419
likely not the last

[14-Sep-18 11:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
```Arguments:
1. "transactions"        (string, required) A json array of json objects
     [
       {
         "txid":"id",  (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout":n        (numeric, required) The output number

2. "addresses"           (string, required) a json object with addresses as keys and amounts as values

[14-Sep-18 11:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the important part

[14-Sep-18 11:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are giving ONE argument, which is an array, where, I think, you should be giving 2 arguments

[14-Sep-18 11:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
or actually, the second argument doesn't have `{}` around it, see that?

[14-Sep-18 11:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've tried it several different ways. Not sure which one is off at this point.

Parse error is worse than "expected type array"

[14-Sep-18 11:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
agreed

[14-Sep-18 11:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can try with the keys, I guess...
