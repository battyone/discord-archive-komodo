these are the steps @NutellaLicka 

there are efforts to automate/streamline most of them but that's under development

> Also, are notarisation costs pay per notarisation?
yes but you pay the yearly amount

Perfect, thanks @gcharang I hadn't dug deep enough it turns out

[27-May-19 06:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Is there a guide cost/notarisation at all?

[27-May-19 06:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
New z_createrawtransaction RPC coming down the line. Let me know if the API makes sense to you and/or if you want it to work differently

[27-May-19 06:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
"you" being anybody that might want to create raw transactions with shielded inputs and/or outputs

[27-May-19 06:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka each coin pays differently based on their min xtn amounts, for instance GAME spends a lot more on notarization because they are unable to make 0.0001 utxos

[27-May-19 06:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ah right. So do KMD charge a fee on top of those per notarisation costs?

[27-May-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, each project negotiates some kind of yearly service fee, in addition to the raw transaction costs

[27-May-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
otherwise, all the work notary nodes do to secure all those 3rd party coins, would be for free. That is not sustainable

[27-May-19 06:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
additionally, some coins integrate dpow themselves or I have been contracted to add dpow to various coins. That is a one time fee that is negotiated based on complexity

[27-May-19 06:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you haven't read this, it goes over a lot of this stuff: `https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md`

[27-May-19 06:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks, that also looks like a must read. Is the actual cost to each coin "in confidence", or are these open figures?

[27-May-19 01:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka every coin makes a custom deal, there is no standard price, as far as I know

[28-May-19 01:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Decker do you have any potential use cases where you would make raw zxtns ? I want to make sure z_createrawtransaction can do things that you might want to do with it, and that the API makes sense

[28-May-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one would assume the use cases would be the exact same as for "normal" raws

[28-May-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 sure, i am looking for specific use cases like "3 zaddr inputs with 1 taddr and 1 zaddr output", things I can actually use as test data to make sure they work

[28-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
z_sendmany does not allow something like that

[28-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
just wondering if there is a specific use case I can test with

[28-May-19 01:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
or I will just make up some junk

[28-May-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that z_sendmany is backwards to sendmany has always been odd to me

[28-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
z_createrawtransaction is meant to be dead simple to use if you know createrawtransaction

[28-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's almost the same, but might need some slight tweaks

[28-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
right now, I make it so you give the `address` of the sapling note (zutxo) you are spending

[28-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it might be possible to look up, but it's hella annoying

[28-May-19 01:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
so that is one additional bit of data you give for inputs

[28-May-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
losing the "no duplicates" constraints of sendmany is the main reason I use raws, if that helps

[28-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i removed that duplicate thing in z_sendmany in kmd a while ago but it seems a recent merge brought it back.

[28-May-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
if somebody wants to send to a duplicate address, my philosophy is "let them"

[28-May-19 01:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
The difference between what RPCs will let you do and consensus rules is very interesting. Some things I see a reason for (protect a user from setting a fee > amount), but others just seem lame (like duplicate receivers). In theory, this protects against "spam" but any real attacker will just use raw xtns. It doesn't actually help anything and makes it annoying to do certain things

[28-May-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c I am merging latest FSM into hush and just kind of wondering: is this the latest verushash v2 I am seeing? or a bug fix to the older version of verushash that kmd has?

[28-May-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not it is verushash 1.1

[28-May-19 02:54 PM] dukeleto#7326

normally that would mess up FR stuff, but they plan to enable that with "Blossom", when the FR ends

[28-May-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so they are trying to morphing gradually into PIRATE, just without forced privacy

@dukeleto By latest Decker's PR we switched from gcc-6 to gcc-8 on OSX because of linkage errors on gcc@6. In case if you have not gcc@8 on your Mac - could you please `brew install gcc@8` and try to compile again?

[28-May-19 06:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i have been using clang 9.1, i will see what I can do. At this point i want to never dev from os x again, lol

👍 😂

I've tested OSX build before this PR and it was fine with gcc@8 on High Sierra and Mojave. For order answered in GH issue too 😃

hmm, yeah it seems that having multiple gcc versions installed via homebrew is not as simple as I thought

[29-May-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
might have to do `brew link` as well

[29-May-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i didn't do that after switching

i am so sick of every time I pull in KMD upstream, it doesn't work on a mac. I am not blaming anybody, it's just so infruriating

[29-May-19 12:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
all i want to do is hack on the code i want to hack on

[29-May-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
and instead, i am deep in the bowels of compiler/linker issues

[29-May-19 12:52 PM] dukeleto#7326

so i am going to try some of that

[29-May-19 12:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
let's see if i break my entire compiler chain

{Reactions}
🤞 

[29-May-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
at least i am learning more about `brew`, tho i don't want to

[29-May-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
Thing I learned: if you don't `make clean` in between changing compiler versions, you can find some weird bugs!

[29-May-19 12:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
so i am compiling from scratch now, with gcc 8

[29-May-19 12:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
not unlinking and relinking probably caused many issues in the past when I tried this trick

[29-May-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, i feel lucky at least, i got `error 77`

[29-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
I didn't set the correct env var for build.sh it seems, it found gcc-6

[29-May-19 01:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
i thought that was the whole point of `brew link`

build-mac.sh is an abomination

[29-May-19 01:10 PM] TonyL#3577
export CC=gcc-6 and so on (thats why it ignores $CC I think)

[29-May-19 01:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
it should not exist

[29-May-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
it existed briefly in ZEC upstream, KMD pulled it in, and then ZEC merged it into build.sh

[29-May-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
so build-mac.sh should not exist

[29-May-19 01:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
it has bugs constantly, because it's forgotten about. The best solution is to merge it back to build.sh. It's probably only a few lines different, but it's super annoying, I know
