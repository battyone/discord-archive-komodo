or if i can have the link for that

[27-Nov-18 11:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As I I might be able to make this happen in run time, using some other code I worked out... my guess is that it somhow ends up with phantom utxo

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont really have a link,. I found it in the source code

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it clears all txs in the wallet

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then rescans it

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to make sure the wallet DB matches the blockchain

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
by any chance are you useing the staking nodes to send transactions?

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if so please dont

[27-Nov-18 11:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

Add -zapwallettx function, a diagnostic tool to assist in wallet r...
It is somewhat suboptimal in that it loads every wallet record, when it really should just scan keys.

[27-Nov-18 11:59 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i am sending transactions

[27-Nov-18 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean using nodes to send transactions

[27-Nov-18 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh god

[27-Nov-18 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😮

[27-Nov-18 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now its seems to be stopped again 😦

[27-Nov-18 12:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on both servers it says invalid block mined try again 😦

[27-Nov-18 12:01 PM] D.rabbani#9094
what shall i do will it erase all trasnaction records 😦

[27-Nov-18 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually when i restarted again it mined the block ?

[27-Nov-18 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
dont really know what is wrong with this chain

[27-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
have you dont zapwalelttxs

[27-Nov-18 12:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[27-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am only guess as I dont have access to you node, but tis treying to stake with utos that dont exist

[27-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
please zapwalelttxs and tell me result after 24-48h

[27-Nov-18 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is valuable info if it proves to work, and I might be able to figure out a fix for it.

[27-Nov-18 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that wont require constant restarts.

[27-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is no chance if losing anything... the utxos are on the blockchain they cant go anywhere, the wallet DB just sucks... A LOT!

[27-Nov-18 12:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this is from BTC ... and we just ahve to live with it at this time.

[27-Nov-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and please use a diffrent node to send txs to the one that is staking, this is 99% likely the issue you have, although I cant rule out another bug of some kind, however we tested these chains very thoughly.

[27-Nov-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i can use staking node 2 as for transactions ?

[27-Nov-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
waiting for it

[27-Nov-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hope it works

[27-Nov-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i need to put that zapwallettxs on both nodes

[27-Nov-18 12:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
as per i have read it removes all transactions that are not in block chain

[27-Nov-18 12:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
am i right but it wont effect any of my transactions ?

[27-Nov-18 12:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and will contine building the blocks from where i left?

[27-Nov-18 12:25 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai its stopped so now i am using this zapwallettxs

[27-Nov-18 12:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okay so i have put all the -ac_name commands and in the end its like -zapwallettxes & ?

[27-Nov-18 12:28 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is it correct -zapwallettxes

[27-Nov-18 12:31 PM] D.rabbani#9094
how long will it take ?

[27-Nov-18 12:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i did zapwallettxes

[27-Nov-18 12:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but it still rescanning 😮

[27-Nov-18 12:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
prays all round

[27-Nov-18 12:35 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes back on track again

[27-Nov-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`how long will it take ?`
`as per i have read it removes all transactions that are not in block chain`
Yes and no
`zapwallettxs` empties out the wallet database and rescans the blockchain and rebuilds the wallet database, so it'll take however long it takes to scan the chain (less time with smaller chains, more time with longer chains)

[27-Nov-18 12:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
actually it wasnt that long

[27-Nov-18 12:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but currently i am again facing the issues of invalid block mined on both of my nodes

[27-Nov-18 12:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
staking *

[27-Nov-18 12:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nodes

[27-Nov-18 12:56 PM] D.rabbani#9094
lets see if it surpass this issues it worked quite well in the beginning build atleast 25 blocks

[27-Nov-18 12:57 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now again its back to normal when i did setgenerate true 0

[27-Nov-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I scrolled back...
You will get `invalid block mined` when you try to build a PoW block for a 100% PoS chain, because "100%"

[27-Nov-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i did set generate true 0

[27-Nov-18 01:03 PM] D.rabbani#9094
on both my nodes ?

[27-Nov-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
-1= all cores PoW
0 = PoS
any positive number = that many cores PoW

[27-Nov-18 01:07 PM] D.rabbani#9094
set its on POS then

[27-Nov-18 01:07 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes *

[27-Nov-18 01:07 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so basically whats the problem now zapwallettxes are done

[27-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but its still stuck

[27-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no block are generating

[27-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am really worried

[27-Nov-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how many addresses and how many UTXOs are you trying to stake with?

[27-Nov-18 01:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai what we did is like set pos splitter on 1st staking node 
pos spiltter on second staking node 

then the mining reward is distributed only to Two particular addresses

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its like 128 addreses in all 64 on 1st 64 on second

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how long is your chain?

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
at some times it mines the block perfectly fine

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
wait

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
20389 its trying to mine  20390 but here its stuck as invalid

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 01:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
please help me out it was woriking fine since 15 days

[27-Nov-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
when did you split them?

[27-Nov-18 01:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
we split them after 100 blocks

[27-Nov-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, not recently?

[27-Nov-18 01:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nope

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
do i need to split them every time

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it means

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so if i stop the daemon and start again

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it will work fine for some of the blocks

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and then again it will be back to normal

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
:/

[27-Nov-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was asking to make sure they were mature enough (as in you didn't do it like an hr ago)

[27-Nov-18 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can i check my balance

[27-Nov-18 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[27-Nov-18 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
getbalance 64

[27-Nov-18 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just hold on

[27-Nov-18 01:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
mature  : 378346454.5002835
immature : 772668475.5634489,

[27-Nov-18 01:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
772M! holy fek

[27-Nov-18 01:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have stopped the daemon

[27-Nov-18 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is your block reward?

[27-Nov-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
100  coins

[27-Nov-18 01:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its distributed on 2 addresses particularly

[27-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you did a 1 billion+ coin premine?

[27-Nov-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
just as a test its not actual

[27-Nov-18 01:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes kind of

[27-Nov-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like it will fall off ?

[27-Nov-18 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`just as a test its not actual`
I get that, I'm just trying to see what you have, where, and why (otherwise I'd just be guessing)

[27-Nov-18 01:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so what is the best step to do ?

[27-Nov-18 01:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now the blocks are fine

[27-Nov-18 01:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because i have restarted the daemon
