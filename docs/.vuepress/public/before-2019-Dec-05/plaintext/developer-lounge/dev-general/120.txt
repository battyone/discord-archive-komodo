[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont want to stake from the 60 billion balance

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i did getbalance 64

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it shows immature 60 billion and mature 0.001 \

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
in staking its 0..01

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so atleast i can transfer 2 million

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
in the mature balance so that blocks go smoothly right

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think you can stake UTXOs below 1 coin

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Oh üòÆ

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its stopped

[09-Feb-19 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
is that not in the doc? Would have to update it if not

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i havent seen it sorry it would of been

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
you're going to have a hard time kick starting the chain again if it's stalled

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but now i want to send some coins to the mature balance

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
would recommend starting it fresh

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai yes no worries

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it is stalled

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
if it's stalled, you cannot send coins at all

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
`i have set generate false`

[09-Feb-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i can send some coins now as well

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have my self set generate false

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
after the mining reward has reached

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
ok can you explain what you ultimately want to accomplish?

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
you want an ac_eras chain with 65 billion coin premine

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
liek the chain can go on to 65 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
I understand that part

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
but what is the trouble

[09-Feb-19 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the trouble is with the staking mate

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like for say

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have 65 billion balance now

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i know that i cannot stake with these coins

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
all 65 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i did `getbalance 64 `

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its giving me only 0.001 in mature balance and thats staking

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
while rest are on immature

[09-Feb-19 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the 60 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
ok, delete the current chain and start it again

mine the first couple blocks

send the coins you don't want to stake to an address not owned by the node you will stake from

do RNDsendmany with the remaining coins you want to stake(must be >1 coin UTXO) ASAP

continue to POW mine until block 100 then do `setgenerate true 0` on the staking node

[09-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
that make sense?

[09-Feb-19 05:18 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yup it does

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thank you @Alright

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
probably best to mine blocks 1 and 2, stop the chain then send/split the coins

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
then begin mining again

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but in the eras the coinbase maturaity is 100 right ?

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
if i mine block 1 and 2 the balance will be 60 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419
Ah yes, this is a mess üòÇ

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oh sorry

[09-Feb-19 05:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
20 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
becasue premine is 0

[09-Feb-19 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c we need some exceptions for ac_eras ac_staked I believe

[09-Feb-19 05:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
supply is zero

[09-Feb-19 05:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yup

[09-Feb-19 05:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[09-Feb-19 05:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai i wil send 2 million to the other node

[09-Feb-19 05:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and then do the RNDsendmany.py

[09-Feb-19 05:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but i am confused about the percentage variance ?

[09-Feb-19 05:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like can i set it at 5 ?

[09-Feb-19 05:22 PM] Alright#0419
percentage variance means all UTXO amounts will be within 5% of each other

[09-Feb-19 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
or something like that lol @blackjok3r made it

[09-Feb-19 05:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hahah

[09-Feb-19 05:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai thanks aliright for the help üòÉ

[09-Feb-19 05:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes its to say how much the utxo size varies... Seems pretty self explanatory üòÇ

[09-Feb-19 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani if you desperately need to do this now, you can change this
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/7598204bf98d5316c3dad7c40a458810b6c71d55/src/komodo_utils.h#L1938

to 
`if (ASSETCHAINS_LASTERA == 0 || strcmp(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL,"<YOUR CHAIN'S ac_name>") == 0)`
then rebuild komodod

[09-Feb-19 05:28 PM] Alright#0419
that will set coinbase maturity to 1, but you would need that change on every single node

[09-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r make a ac_maturity param so we can get rid of this ac_eras exception üôè

[09-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Alright#0419
pretty please

[09-Feb-19 05:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sounds easy enough

[09-Feb-19 05:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I am open to an -ac_maturity pull request

[09-Feb-19 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds useful

[09-Feb-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not so sure, delaying maturing of mined blocks seems a bit artificial

[09-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Alright#0419
should be `if (strcmp(ASSETCHAINS_SYMBOL,"VRSC") == 0)` IMO

[09-Feb-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
except we dont know what chains already are running with eras

[09-Feb-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess those chains can set -ac_maturity=100

[09-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Alright#0419
don't believe we have any chains using ac_eras right now

[09-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Alright#0419
no production chains at least

[10-Feb-19 04:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
we need to fix OS X on the `dev` branch

[10-Feb-19 04:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
```
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `libcc.so', needed by `komodod'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
```

[10-Feb-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe i didn't use build-mac.sh properly, i always forget. trying again....

[10-Feb-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
nope, it seems build-mac.sh errors out with that message

[10-Feb-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
mostly, it's choosing between .so and .dylib correctly in a few Makefiles

[10-Feb-19 04:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
src/cc/Makefile does the right thing, it seems

[10-Feb-19 04:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
but not the top level Makefile

[10-Feb-19 05:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
ooh, i think i just fixed it with `$(OBJEXT)`

[10-Feb-19 05:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
nope

[10-Feb-19 05:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto yea mate, I was using build-mac file

[10-Feb-19 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have a query that i had two nodes from which i generated 10 billion on one node

[10-Feb-19 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i moved the balance on the other node

[10-Feb-19 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
just say 1000 remained on the first node

[10-Feb-19 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and rest on the second node

[10-Feb-19 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
my question is

[10-Feb-19 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the remaining 1000 on the first node

[10-Feb-19 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
is coming in immature balance

[10-Feb-19 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and i cannot stack trhoguh it

[10-Feb-19 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
like why ?

[10-Feb-19 10:32 AM] D.rabbani#9094
whats the problem

[10-Feb-19 10:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
`mature": 0,
  "immature": 7.08024261,
  `

[10-Feb-19 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the things is when i switch from POW to pos after 100 blocks the confirmations of premine balance is reset to `0` why ????

[10-Feb-19 12:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
anyhelp will really be appreciated this is the reason when it reaches the POS stage i have 0 utxos to stake from because the confirmations goes to 0 again during POS

[10-Feb-19 12:02 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  please if you can

[10-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to send th coins before block 10 ...

[10-Feb-19 12:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then dont send tham again
