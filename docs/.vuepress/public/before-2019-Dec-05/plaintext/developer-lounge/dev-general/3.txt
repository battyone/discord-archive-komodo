it's like they sample the blockchain, and find blockhashes which exceed the target by N number of zeros (1,2,3,...) which they call superblocks, and the make a linked list of those blocks. Since they are randomly located and very hard to predict, they are like compressing the blockheaders into a smaller structure. These things are for SPV wallets to use, instead of downloading all block headers. They don't conflict with notarization and both could be used

[16-Jul-18 08:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
Electrum used to download a large static blockheader file from a centralized server, newer electrums store 1 checkpoint per target interval (2016 blocks for BTC) and verify against that. I think nipowpows could be interesting, but I think they still need data in each blockheader, so you either start with it from genesis or you need some kind of fork to get it

[16-Jul-18 08:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
i tried to understand what they mean by "velvet fork" but it just seems like a buzzword to be honest

Have you read the paper of the Avalanche consensus system? A new consensus that is neither PoW nor PoS. They are trying to create a coin based on this.

@Deleted User that is this "bug": https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/issues/185 and the only workaround is to stop electrumx when this happens, run the `compact_history.py` script and start electrumx agaian... here is the CLI for KMD: `COIN=Komodo DB_DIRECTORY=/electrumdb/KMD ~/electrumx/compact_history.py`

still to test notary stuff.  i want to dockerize it (btc done https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-bitcoind-regtest), then create assetchains in docker/regtest mode.  interest should work, but that's an assumption atm - all blockchain functions should work, which is why i wanna test hoek, some basic cc stuff.

[19-Jul-18 11:46 PM] Mylo#8306
are you a dev?  just use docker - you can fire up hundreds of blockchains if you have enough CPU/RAM

I only used it, for scaling because launching 1024 chains in the first teat literally took me all day, it was the most repetitive boring job I have ever done. And if something went wrong it was not easy to find or fix.

[22-Jul-18 01:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that Zcash merged some upstream BTC stuff about "insane fees" (which somebody renamed absurd fees to be politically correct) and there was a bug in it, since BTC deals with fees differently than Zcash, and nobody really noticed, but I did. It effects HushList protocol, which uses amount=0 transactions to use the memo field for "free", other than xtn fee

[22-Jul-18 01:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
with that PR, you can now use the memo field for "free" and blend into the rest of network traffic with a default fee, before, you could not, you had to use a custom fee <= to your amount, or 0 for amount=0, which really stands out
