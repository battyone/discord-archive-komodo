Look inside your (fiat) wallet.   Each note and coin is a "UTXO".  UTXO is non-divisible amount, just like a 20 dollar note.  If you buy something for $10.  you give your $20, and get $10 change, you don't rip your $20 in half.   instead of physical notes with fixed values.  our notes (UTXO) can be any previous amount used for change, ready to be spent again.  hope that helps a bit.  give it another read, slowly.  there's vids on youtube to explain some of these concepts in more real world terms üòÉ

@jl777c I think you will find this wiki page a succinct way to see if incompatible changes are coming in via BTC 0.17, which could effect notaries trying to use the latest btc. There are a few backward incompat changes, of course: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.17.0-Release-notes#low-level-rpc-changes

also, txindexes are now much friendlier in btc 0.17, you can incrementally build them up and use partially synced chains that didn't have txindex: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/0.17.0-Release-notes#transaction-index-changes

but no sense to update BTC

[28-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Meyse#0952
when i run this on windows, it gives a JSON error, any idea why that is? komodo-cli.exe signrawtransaction "hexstring" ([{"txid":"the_txid","vout":1,"scriptPubKey":"bladiebla","redeemScript":"37898ew7er98adjf"}] ["privatekey"])

[28-Aug-18 06:39 PM] Meyse#0952
we cant get it to work, help would be appreciated

[28-Aug-18 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
without the exact cli, impossible to spot any syntax error. dont need the privkey, but it seems you need to escape the arrays

[28-Aug-18 06:44 PM] bartwr#6773
Like this?

`komodo-cli.exe signrawtransaction "hexstring" ([{\"txid\":\"the_txid\",\"vout\":1,\"scriptPubKey\":\"bladiebla\",\"redeemScript\":\"37898ew7er98adjf\"}] ["privatekey"])`

[28-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and put the "[...]" arrays inside quotes

[28-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and \" inside the array

[28-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
\

[28-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
\ "

[28-Aug-18 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
for the privatekey also

[28-Aug-18 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes it is easier to just use curl to submit

[28-Aug-18 06:46 PM] bartwr#6773
`komodo-cli.exe signrawtransaction "hexstring" "[{\"txid\":\"the_txid\",\"vout\":1,\"scriptPubKey\":\"bladiebla\",\"redeemScript\":\"37898ew7er98adjf\"}]" "[\"privatekey\"]"`

Whoo, seems to work indeed!

[28-Aug-18 06:50 PM] bartwr#6773
Thank you very much, jl. Took a while, was difficult to debug. Now this ^ works on Windows indeed. I will remember the fact that curl is sometimes easier to work with.

@criptobear the truth will come out, all these copy catting is similar to forking bitcoin and then claiming your fork is better, even though all you did was change some printouts

and the people who know about things, will see more and more that KMD is leading in many different areas of crypto

[29-Aug-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
any group that is charged with actually researching the various crypto projects seems to rank KMD slightly above its current marketcap ranking, this then becomes the driving force for upward price pressure. but this channel is for devs, not traders

Is it possible to have a separated chain for smart contracts?

[31-Aug-18 11:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes each chain decides if cryptoconditions are active or not

[31-Aug-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and each independent chain runs CC contracts independently, since each chain is independent

[31-Aug-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the only exceptions would be cross chain contracts that use tx from other chains as input to their local contracts

[31-Aug-18 11:06 AM] ttt#3928
so it's depend from -ac_cc config flag?

[31-Aug-18 11:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
This is the network cluster on which the chain can interact with other chains via cross chain smart contracts. This functionality is still in testing. If this is set to 1, the chain will have smart contracts enabled, but it will not be able to interact with other chains. If this is set to any number other than 0 or 1, the chain can interact with other chains on the same network cluster. For example, all -ac_cc=2 chains can interact with each other but may not interact with -ac_cc=3 chains. If you‚Äôd like to explicitly disable smart contracts set this value to 0.

[31-Aug-18 12:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
for MoMoM

[31-Aug-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
that is for fungible chains, it is actually 101+ in the latest

[31-Aug-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so ccid >1 && ccid < 101 are clusters that can validate each other's transactions, but they are not fungible

When you start komodo with an empty .komodo file, shouldnt it populate it with default rpc credentials etc?

Hello,

I don't understand how the initiator redeeming the transaction on the blockchain reveals the secret to the participant.

1) Is the secret sent as clear text in a data field of the transaction? How to send and encode the secret will depend on each blockchain right?

2) What prevents the initiator from sending a wrong secret in the redeeming transaction?
```

Question from reddit üëÜ  https://www.reddit.com/r/komodoplatform/comments/9c7a7u/sending_the_secret_in_the_redeeming_transaction/?st=jlk8t6yg&sh=15c45525

Hi guys. Skeptic here, so pardon the potential fud. Is there any expectation of decentralization at the child chain? They're not inherently central or decentralized? Is there any risk to the other children if one is compromised? Is there any risk to komodo for notarizing compromised child states(?)?

[02-Sep-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if one chain is compromised, that chain is compromised, but it wont affect other chains

[02-Sep-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like if LTC is compromised, DOGE is still ok

[02-Sep-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you are skeptical over

[02-Sep-18 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
independent chains are independent, they independently notarize to KMD

[02-Sep-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and not sure what you mean by "compromised"
