of course, instead of just automatically returning all keys from getinfo, insight lists every key in very redundant code

[07-Jan-19 02:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
which i have just found, and now add another line to, to grab notarized

[07-Jan-19 02:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
bin/mynode/node_modules/insight-api-hush/lib/status.js , of course

[07-Jan-19 02:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is why we can't have nice things

and now i need to figure out how to minify and restart this without breaking the explorer, always fun

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Question? How hard do you think it would be for insight to show more information for a tx?
Is this much the same as what your doing here?  Getting more info from the getinfo call. 
I am about to add information for the export/import transactions to the RPC calls, with the end goal, of the exporer linking from the import tx to the other chains explkorer showing the export.

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r trivial, mostly. Sacrifice to the insight gods correctly and you will be spared

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am just rendering getinfo data on the main index view

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
but same goes for tx view

[07-Jan-19 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... I makanged to get things workign on znomp so I guess it would be similar...

[07-Jan-19 02:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's the same kind of horrific JS you have come to love

[07-Jan-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I should probably start at the explorer right, and then work back to the rpc changes...

[07-Jan-19 02:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
might make it easier down the road

[07-Jan-19 02:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
JS gets data from RPC, stores in variable. You use that variable in a template, that is about it

[07-Jan-19 02:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
yup

[07-Jan-19 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
good luck there üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 02:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
if the hush explorer is down, you will know who to blame

[07-Jan-19 02:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
no idea how to make the live running process take into account a change of this js file

[07-Jan-19 02:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Dont think you can

[07-Jan-19 04:42 AM] Mylo#8306
webpack usually does the minification and build pipeline.

[07-Jan-19 04:42 AM] Mylo#8306
but depends if insight build uses webpack.  there'll be some other js builder in there.

i had to do the same for glxt

[07-Jan-19 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
this is how @pbca26 told me how to do it

[07-Jan-19 08:15 AM] jorian#4555
since i got burned badly by directly editing minified files

[07-Jan-19 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to work with insight atm ... Its pretty horrible... I litterally have to commit every test to git then reinstall the entire explorer each time, trial and error each change its stupid time consuming üò¶

[07-Jan-19 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
you can start a hot version on localhost, but i forgot how

[07-Jan-19 09:13 AM] jorian#4555
we really need more js gurus in here

[07-Jan-19 09:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nar we just need to stop using it

[07-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
whqat I am doing doesn't even apppear to be working ... Im committing changes reinstalling it.... and it stays the same

[07-Jan-19 09:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
guessing I need to figure out how to do what You posted to the webpage repo part

[07-Jan-19 09:17 AM] jorian#4555
stop using js?

[07-Jan-19 09:18 AM] jorian#4555
js being the most used language, yeah, good idea üòÑ

[07-Jan-19 09:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its also the worst

[07-Jan-19 01:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can stop using js for sure, and move to web assembly code and replace that for js üòâ

[07-Jan-19 01:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but still js will still be used a tiny bit there in web page

[07-Jan-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
new frameworks spawning are making it more good to move to just pure core language based apps which can still service with no js usage at all.

[07-Jan-19 01:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be in few years we probably have a chance of a js less web app all built using core language code and html

[07-Jan-19 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
one thing I admire about XMR world is they have pure-html no-JS explorers, because that is much more secure and fast

[07-Jan-19 05:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
some are written in C++, not sure about others

[07-Jan-19 05:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool!

[07-Jan-19 05:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian thank you very much, looking at that now

[07-Jan-19 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
`(no javascript - no cookies - no web analytics trackers - no images -` now that is a real explorer

[07-Jan-19 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like a `grunt compile` and/or a `bitcore-node restart` might be what i need

[07-Jan-19 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
if somebody wrote a similar explorer to the above, for zcash forks, I would buy them a üç∫ or 2

[07-Jan-19 05:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
looks like using teamplate system in the core code with other libraries

[07-Jan-19 05:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool ideas there

[07-Jan-19 05:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will try such things in golang too

@blackjok3r groovy

[07-Jan-19 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopeful a URL redirect with the info in the left address box is enough to link to other explorers.

[07-Jan-19 05:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
saves butchering the JS and templates... looks too hard. üòÉ

i ran grunt compile, it said it worked, and now the explorer index page does not render with ```Uncaught ReferenceError: angular is not defined
    at main.min.js:2```

[07-Jan-19 06:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
i severely dislike JS build systems

[07-Jan-19 06:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 i might could need your help

@kimmel (Pungo.io) 

Thanks!  It's a team effort, for sure, though. Many fingerprints are on every page.

[08-Jan-19 07:42 PM] AspenShredder#5419
is their going to be a max supply of KMD?

[08-Jan-19 07:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
Between 160 and 200mio not fixxed as not everybody is claiming rewards

[08-Jan-19 07:47 PM] AspenShredder#5419
so circulating supply is 160million -200million and  no fixed supply?

[08-Jan-19 07:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
Current cirulating supply is about 112mio
And at block 7'777'777 the rewards are no longer accrued. So 160m to 200m sounds like a good number.
Of course its still 12 years to go so the code can change if community supportsnit.

[08-Jan-19 07:51 PM] AspenShredder#5419
So at block 7,777,777 the total number of KMD is reflective of how many where currently out there and how many were being held collecting rewards compounded?

[08-Jan-19 07:52 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Hypothetically speaking seeing as there will be no way to account for what that would be.

[08-Jan-19 07:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
Thats is correct no way to say now

[08-Jan-19 07:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Just guestimates

[08-Jan-19 07:53 PM] AspenShredder#5419
Block 7,777,777 is still 12 years out?

[08-Jan-19 07:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes 12.5 years from now

[08-Jan-19 07:58 PM] AspenShredder#5419
monthly roi correct?

[08-Jan-19 07:58 PM] AspenShredder#5419
or daily?

[08-Jan-19 07:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
Rewards are accured by blockheight so each block or in minutes each 1 minute

[08-Jan-19 07:59 PM] AspenShredder#5419
5% year?

[08-Jan-19 08:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
5% APR, which if you do each month to maximize, will become 5.1% APY

[08-Jan-19 08:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
utxos accrue a 5% APR reward for up to 31 days, then you must collect reward, and the game starts again

[08-Jan-19 08:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
you might find very old docs that don't have the monthly stipulation, that started at block 1M, iirc

[08-Jan-19 08:01 PM] AspenShredder#5419
so the max looks like it would be 372,446,541 assuming current circulating supply of 200mil, 5.1% APY

[08-Jan-19 08:02 PM] AspenShredder#5419
and with a 12.5 year out block height

[08-Jan-19 08:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have no idea of the stats on lost KMD or KMD that never has interest collected

[08-Jan-19 08:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
so max is most likely much larger than reality

[08-Jan-19 08:02 PM] AspenShredder#5419
and assuming all coins are recieving rewards which they are not

[08-Jan-19 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, only utxos >= 10 KMD accrue rewards

[08-Jan-19 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
utxos smaller than that, don't

[08-Jan-19 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
so the calculation is not simple

[08-Jan-19 08:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
There are a lot of utxos not claiming  I think that would be an instressting stats to do.
Rewards accrued by day month year.

[08-Jan-19 08:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTW, also, utxos older than block 1M still have old reward rules. In case it wasn't complex enough üòÉ
