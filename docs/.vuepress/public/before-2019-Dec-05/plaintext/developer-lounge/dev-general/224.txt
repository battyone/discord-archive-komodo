Could just use KomodoOcean as well

[19-Sep-19 07:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you need a GUI

[19-Sep-19 07:56 PM] xeonrider#3120
wua thanks @polycryptoblog

[19-Sep-19 07:56 PM] jorian#4555
oh right, a QT wallet exists as well, maybe that is safer

[19-Sep-19 07:57 PM] xeonrider#3120
@polycryptoblog I'd prefer a web wallet thing, or something that could interact with a webapp - nothing special.

[19-Sep-19 07:57 PM] xeonrider#3120
I'll look at KomodoOcean

[19-Sep-19 07:57 PM] xeonrider#3120
what is it?

QT wallet for native mode

[19-Sep-19 07:59 PM] xeonrider#3120
I want just the basic things like the tipbot has

[19-Sep-19 07:59 PM] xeonrider#3120
send and receive

[19-Sep-19 07:59 PM] xeonrider#3120
I could wrap something that interacts with the komodo-cli, but that shouldn't be a smart move imho

[19-Sep-19 08:01 PM] xeonrider#3120
where can I find all the commands for komodo-cli? (online)

[19-Sep-19 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`komodo-cli help` - an item list
`komodo-cli help item` - help for a specific item

[19-Sep-19 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's built in, no need to look for it online

That too 😅

[19-Sep-19 08:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, or that 😛

[19-Sep-19 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to his cave_

[19-Sep-19 08:06 PM] xeonrider#3120
so, the cli doesn't have an online reference?

[19-Sep-19 08:06 PM] xeonrider#3120
or it issues all the available api?

[19-Sep-19 08:07 PM] xeonrider#3120
because, couldn't I use the RPC call to do the same?

[19-Sep-19 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
API/RPC tend to be used in conversation interchangeably

[19-Sep-19 08:09 PM] xeonrider#3120
I mean, since I know how to make rpc calls, if the cli uses that, shouldn't I be able to create addresses with the API?

[19-Sep-19 08:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you can, just scroll back, jorian told you how

[19-Sep-19 08:10 PM] xeonrider#3120
ah ok - so how would that work, because normally you'd need private keys or secure a wallet with a seed right?

[19-Sep-19 08:11 PM] jorian#4555
use curl to talk to the blockchain

[19-Sep-19 08:12 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am going to use the RPC stuff from Tony, I am not going to make a terminal application but a webapp

[19-Sep-19 08:12 PM] jorian#4555
awesome 👍

[19-Sep-19 08:12 PM] xeonrider#3120
but I am still not understanding to make a simple wallet, like the tipbot does

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
like i said

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
the tipbot is not a wallet

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
under the hood it probably just tracks `discord user` and the balance it has

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
in a simple db

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
the tipbot is used for tipping people

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] xeonrider#3120
right, so it holds an address and ties it to a user

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
not even that

[19-Sep-19 08:13 PM] jorian#4555
user and balance, that's all you need

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] jorian#4555
to be a tipbot

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] jorian#4555
a wallet is much more complicated

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] xeonrider#3120
but you can withdraw and receive with it too

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] jorian#4555
yes

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I am not going to make a terminal application but a webapp`
instead of curl, it'd be sockets without the curl wrapper 🤷🏽 
It seem like you're trying to over think this and needlessly confusing yourself

[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] xeonrider#3120
thats all the functionality I need

[19-Sep-19 08:15 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am not confusing myself, but maybe I am asking the wrong questions.

[19-Sep-19 08:15 PM] jorian#4555
you just want a chain where you can send and receive coins

[19-Sep-19 08:15 PM] xeonrider#3120
sorry, I'll just move along.

[19-Sep-19 08:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Do you know how to connect to bitcoind?

[19-Sep-19 08:16 PM] jorian#4555
look, i think we've shown we are willing to help, but we can't give you everything on a silver platter

[19-Sep-19 08:16 PM] jorian#4555
there's a lot of documentation

[19-Sep-19 08:16 PM] jorian#4555
if something in that documentation is unclear, ask

[19-Sep-19 08:16 PM] jorian#4555
but really, rtfd

[19-Sep-19 08:17 PM] xeonrider#3120
you are right, sorry. I'll just go.

[19-Sep-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@xeonrider do you know how to make ajax calls to bitcoind?

[19-Sep-19 08:18 PM] xeonrider#3120
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I am already playing with the Komodo rpc using the examples from tony

[19-Sep-19 08:27 PM] xeonrider#3120
I am getting help already from the Verus community, thanks all. I have learned already a lot.

[19-Sep-19 08:27 PM] xeonrider#3120
Won't bother you with my questions.

@xeonrider hey, were you able to launch a chain and interact with it using nodejs?

[20-Sep-19 06:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
@gcharang I was, but I am looking into Verus now with their PBaaS

[20-Sep-19 06:53 AM] gcharang#6833

you'll need to scroll back earlier in your terminal to see what the actual error was

[21-Sep-19 03:01 PM] bspanda98#9356
yes alredy checked but not understand

[21-Sep-19 03:01 PM] gcharang#6833

`please check out the last 3 errors`
We cannot see them
As I said, you have to scroll back in that terminal to see them

[21-Sep-19 03:11 PM] gcharang#6833
what's the error for the fetch params script?

@bspanda98 those bits at the end (that you have shown 4 times now) do not tell us anything, you need to *scroll back further*

Hi guys. Hope everyone is doing well

[23-Sep-19 11:01 PM] nothingtoseehere#2986
I've been playing with the kmd CLI past few days figuring out parameters. I am sure I'm missing something, but am looking for way to set up chain with our own notary nodes. ac_notarypay looks to be for paying the kmd fee for dpow

[23-Sep-19 11:03 PM] nothingtoseehere#2986
I was looking at the rewards module, although it doesn't need to be hosted on vps. Which in my proposed model it is needed.

[23-Sep-19 11:07 PM] nothingtoseehere#2986
@ me if anyone can point me in the right direction

[24-Sep-19 02:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@nothingtoseehere you need to modify source code, that is the only way

[24-Sep-19 02:36 AM] nothingtoseehere#2986
Which would fork KMD

[24-Sep-19 02:37 AM] nothingtoseehere#2986
🤔

[24-Sep-19 02:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, you cannot have your own notaries and be part of the accepted chain (because, consensus)
