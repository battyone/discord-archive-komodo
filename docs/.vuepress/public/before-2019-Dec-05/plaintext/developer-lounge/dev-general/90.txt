[16-Dec-18 04:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its not showing any

[16-Dec-18 04:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 04:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the current longest chain of the block is  87306

[16-Dec-18 04:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its crashed again

[16-Dec-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Dec-18 04:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think thius is the fix .. @Alright might want toi test it first before merging though

[16-Dec-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Verus made some changes that break assumptions

[16-Dec-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
This should revert those and still leave verus stuff woking the same way

[16-Dec-18 04:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i m using the insight one ?

[16-Dec-18 04:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
with sapling_lite

[16-Dec-18 04:33 PM] D.rabbani#9094
please can anyone ?

[16-Dec-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r very basic tests would have caught this breaking change of behavior that came from Verus

[16-Dec-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found them isntantl;y

[16-Dec-18 04:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I fixed them in rush and forgot about it ...

[16-Dec-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
without tests, we will just see this again and again

[16-Dec-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
how many hours of notary node downtime did this cause?

[16-Dec-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed some more of it then ... not 100% sure why its sets gen to false when threads is 0 so i just deleted it .. makes no sense

[16-Dec-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it cause ntoary down time

[16-Dec-18 04:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just exploded the dudes wallet

[16-Dec-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and hes not mean to have those coins ðŸ˜‚

[16-Dec-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will just be that dude in the corner saying "we should have more tests", it's cool

[16-Dec-18 04:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hah I found setgenerate was broken when I was treying to get pos64 workign again

[16-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but it seems it went further than that

[16-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They have defualt threads 0 in init.cpp

[16-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but -1 everywhere else

[16-Dec-18 04:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not a great plan

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
staking changed it's default status in verus recently

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
staking was defaulted to on by default, until stackguard was written, then it was defaulted to off

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it broke komodo PoS

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
like I said, more tests ðŸ˜ƒ

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
stackgaurd is not in KMD

[16-Dec-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
so assumptions of VRSC code may be wrong in KMD

[16-Dec-18 04:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
half of it is ... but it cant work with PoS64 ... i already looked .. as I was just goign to port it top labs myself

[16-Dec-18 04:43 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can i ask a question

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is that the reason

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that the onmly exploeres I know about

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I cant help you with it

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i know @blackjok3r

[16-Dec-18 04:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
no i mean docker ?

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
why cant it work with PoS64?

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt it a matter to call setgenerate true 0

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
set generate was bnroken ... you needed to set it to false before reducing threads

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is a bug

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and for some reason it was defualt to 0 in init.cpp

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i am so stuck sir @jl777c  ? any answer please

[16-Dec-18 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but -1 in komodo_utils.h

[16-Dec-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont use any docker, sorry cant help

[16-Dec-18 04:46 PM] D.rabbani#9094
ohkay

[16-Dec-18 04:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure about all of that PR ... because verus changed the way it worked... unless we can just have verus use the exact same RPC's for mining and stakeing as pos64

[16-Dec-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that would be much easier

[16-Dec-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they use -mint to stake

[16-Dec-18 04:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and -gen to mine

[16-Dec-18 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes -mint was added recently

[16-Dec-18 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok I think thats got it now

[16-Dec-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
set  generate is fixed in that PR, and also you cant try to stake if there is no wallet enabled. 
Notary nodes default to 1 thread
and genproclimit is now default of -1 everywhere.

[16-Dec-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[16-Dec-18 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 05:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hope it might help ?

[16-Dec-18 05:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the problem is i havent setup that server someone else did and he left the job

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
at the moment i am running from docker

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but there is another komodo

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have updated the docker image you told me to

[16-Dec-18 05:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
