could be my ac handling kicks in and it uses the default port

[02-Aug-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe do -ac_name= combined with -regtest

[02-Aug-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
then it would use a different port

[02-Aug-18 08:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
it happens just for the plain `komodod  -daemon -regtest &`

[02-Aug-18 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the ac handling overrides regtest port assignment

morning!!  Yes, generating takes a about 1 minute for 100 blocks.

[02-Aug-18 11:31 PM] Mylo#8306
`-ac_supply=100000000` and generating 150 blocks gets coins.   and mining rewards happen for block height > 100

OK custom rpcport seems like a good enough workaround for me to work with.  I haven't tested.

@Mylo regtest addresses being invalid seems like a bug. `tm` is a prefix from ZEC, and I think Hush uses the same. Something about the base58 prefix of regtest must be incorrect

[07-Aug-18 01:28 AM] Mylo#8306
now a noob question, how are 4 'nodes' created?  and do they sync with each other?   is it just a matter of one regtest chain with 4 wallets?

[07-Aug-18 01:28 AM] Mylo#8306
& thanks!!

[07-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Mylo#8306
because just say i wanted to manually do that on one machine, what would the equivalent be ```komodod -port=XXXX+1``` for each one and get them to sync with each other by -connect=127.0.0.1:XXXX or something?

it's 4 nodes running on your machine, each with their own .komodo/ folder, connected to each other in a particular way

[07-Aug-18 01:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, i think they use -connect= with each other

[07-Aug-18 01:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
line 242 `    from_connection.addnode(ip_port, "onetry")` seems to use addnode with 127.0.0.1 and whatever port is used for each

[07-Aug-18 01:55 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah line 26 has port number 11000 + n for node number plus some modulo thing

[07-Aug-18 01:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
it allows up to 1000 nodes in a test

[07-Aug-18 01:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
and basically chooses the port based on your process id (pid)

Hi @jl777c ,
I am trying to implement KMD claim interest button but I am struggeling to find some documentation on how it actually works. 
This issue: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s/issues/21 is clear to me so ok I know how to get the amount of interest I am eligible to earn from each utxo. I have following qeustions: 
1. Does kmd daemon automatically adds the nlocktime? Or I am supposed to tak the raw hex transaciton and change the last 4 bytes (I believe this is the case)...
2. How does it work? Like who will give me the interest? I suppose somehow the network but how can I tell the network that I want to claim the interest for this specific utxos to that specific vout?

I have skimmed through agama source code and found some referencees in balance.js which calculates the totalinterest and createtx.js which then takes the totalinterest and passes it to transaction builder/creates raw but I still dont see who is signing those txs and where the kmd comes from. Iis it written somewhere else? Thank you for your time

komodod wallet (and agama) adds nLockTime automatically, but the ledger doesnt, so it does need to add it. yes it is the end of the transaction. the funds come from the blockchain rules, it doesnt come from anywhere, it just allows to spend more than the sum of vinds, adjusted by the calculated amount

[08-Aug-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
spending the utxo automatically claims it

[08-Aug-18 12:01 PM] TheTrunk#1040
oh I see now. So if someone sends me 1 KMD I will after few days have 1.1 KMD eventhough the explorer and the transaction will be still saying 1KMD, the network will just allow me to spend 1.1KMD from that utxo right?

[08-Aug-18 12:02 PM] SHossain#0007
minimum 10 KMD required

[08-Aug-18 12:02 PM] TheTrunk#1040
yes I know, this is just an example

[08-Aug-18 12:04 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Ok I tihnk I understand it all now. Maybe why agama is not doing the claim reward automatically?

[08-Aug-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
agama does do the claim when talking to SPV or native komodod

[08-Aug-18 12:05 PM] TheTrunk#1040
I think user see the reward claimed as a new transaction (?)

[08-Aug-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
well using native komodod, it does it automatically, but for SPV it needs to be calculated

[08-Aug-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
not a new transaction, the sum of vins has a bigger value than otherwise, so you usually end up with more change than you otherwise would have

[08-Aug-18 12:17 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Exchanges are mostly utilising standard full node komodod on some linux server. So if you receive funds from exchange, the nLockTime is set defaulty by komodod right? I am thinking if I shouldnt be resending funds from my address to the same my address just to make sure the nLockTime is set. What about pools? There the nlockTime is set by default as well right? I just see so many transactions on explorer with locktime = 0 so that makes me wonder why wallets dont just resend the funds to the same address with nlocktime set

[08-Aug-18 12:18 PM] TheTrunk#1040
it also makes it easier to calculate the reward and funds dont just sit but are in circulation which is a neccessity for the reward to be claimable.

So if wallets just resend the entire address amount to the same address right after some transaction arrives to that address user will be sure that the entire amount of the address is eligible to claim the amount and not just a portion of transactions

pools don't have to worry. they get block rewards of 3KMD and then pay it out to the miners. Since its less than 10 its not getting rewards, and will be up to the miner to take the coins they've recieved and combine them into +10 KMD utxos

and as far as i know, no exchanges are giving out rewards to user.  Some exchanges run komodod in -exchange mode, which gives their rewards back to miners
