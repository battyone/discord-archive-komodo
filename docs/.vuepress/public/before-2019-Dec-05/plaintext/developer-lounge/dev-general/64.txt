@blackjok3r "equal with FSM before vrsc merge" is like, hundreds of commits in the past now üòÉ

[24-Nov-18 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r so you want to carve out some of your changes, but not others, and send to KMD `FSM` branch? and keep some stakednotary stuff separate?

[24-Nov-18 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a complex situation

[24-Nov-18 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
because everything is mixed together, and then you want to easily pull small parts out

[24-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I need to do it how I already said... its the only way ... besically destroy staked repo all together, and stat fomr the verus merged branch and pull staked back in AFTER the fixes james wants.

[24-Nov-18 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we have a horrible bug that was in jls branchBEFORE that verus merge too... of chains not syncing totally randomly.

[24-Nov-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
trying to get somone to tell me where ig originated has been hard...

[24-Nov-18 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but today priority is to track it down if I can.

[24-Nov-18 05:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
the verushash merge was pretty big

[24-Nov-18 05:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
in other situations, you might have other options, but I agree with what you are saying @blackjok3r

[24-Nov-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im not touching that verus merge

[24-Nov-18 05:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r it might not be easy for you to use, but if you are trying to track down when something broke, `git bisect` is the way to go

[24-Nov-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and ths bug existed BEFORE it

[24-Nov-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
starting to affect lots of random things... we have 1 node that is repeatedly doing it .. so thats a good start

[24-Nov-18 05:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
for `git bisect`, you write a shell script that returns true or false, and that defines "good" and "bad" and then `git bisect` can use Newtons Bisection method to cut down the search space in half, repeatedly, to find a commit that "breaks something"

[24-Nov-18 05:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
so you need something deterministic to check for

[24-Nov-18 05:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect

[24-Nov-18 05:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
it can really be a life saver, to track down when something broke. If you can write a deterministic test for it (which isn't always easy)

[24-Nov-18 01:46 PM] enver#0753
Hi guys .. is there  a documentation  about dpow and some examples how to implement it

[24-Nov-18 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
What do you want to dPoW ?

[24-Nov-18 02:08 PM] enver#0753

@enver are you adding DPoW to something?

[24-Nov-18 04:34 PM] dukeleto#7326

Now I remember, bitzec

[24-Nov-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you think DPoW is a scam/hustle, this is a good place to ask questions

if you need technical advice or implementation help, i am a resource

[24-Nov-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
but changing your mind that DPoW is not a scam/hustle, well, we got plenty of people for that üòÉ

[24-Nov-18 04:35 PM] enver#0753
Ok ..  nah didnt say its a scam no way ..

[24-Nov-18 04:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, "hustle" can mean different things

[24-Nov-18 04:36 PM] enver#0753
Just to much of a hustle in that...  how i understud from the docs ... coin  would need  some kind of masternodes

[24-Nov-18 04:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
what do you mean by that?

[24-Nov-18 04:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
no masternodes are needed by coins that add DPoW

[24-Nov-18 04:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD DPoW is not *completely* distributed, there are 64 elected notary nodes which other nodes trust to not be evil. Some coins/communities have a problem with this.

[24-Nov-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am one of those 64 (I actually run it as a team with another person), so maybe you should not trust what I say

[24-Nov-18 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
for examples of external coins that added DPoW: EMC2, GAME, HUSH. None of them have masternodes

[24-Nov-18 04:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
LTC, BTC and ZEC fork, respectively

[24-Nov-18 04:39 PM] enver#0753
Have to read more about how the notarienodes work than...    i see   , i got something  wrong before

[24-Nov-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
@enver notary nodes are a service KMD provides

[24-Nov-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
you don't have to run one. I think I could make that clear in my docs, a few people have that confusion

[24-Nov-18 04:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
you could become a notary node in the future, if you want. That election happens in Q1/Q2 each year

[24-Nov-18 04:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a lot of work, and in reward, notaries earn 75% of the KMD block reward

[24-Nov-18 04:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
but just to add DPoW, you just use the service that notaries provide

[24-Nov-18 04:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
which are "notarizations"

[24-Nov-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
which you can think of as embedding the blockhash of your coin into KMD, which then goes into BTC

[24-Nov-18 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's proof of the correct block hash. even a 51% attack will not be able to make nodes go off the correct chain, even when it's a minority

`in what instance would an honest node build a block on top of a fork 120 seconds older than it's competitor`
In the instance where the DRC has backbone issues created by the CIA in order to support a protocol changing vote blocks that support their particular wants... :trollface: 
or any one of a hundred different things than can happen where a thousand different things can happen during long block times
I can think of a ton of ways that idea can be "reverse manipulated" (some of which we've discussed in locked rooms in the past)

Is Python used (useful) for programming on the Komodo platform or related projects?

[26-Nov-18 06:21 PM] Alright#0419
You can create dapps with python very easily

[26-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
dapps to utilize smart contracts or just general features in the daemon

Would start by looking at either of those and how they interact with the daemon

a CC that knows python and can connect into the blockchain internals

[26-Nov-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
```Chapter 13 - Different Languages
The current codebase is integrated into the komodod codebase, which is C/C++. However, it is possible to use different languages and integrate into the C/C++ as zcash has shown by using the rust language for some parts of the zcashd.

I think any language that is compiled and can create a linkable library while being able to call and be called by C/C++ functions can be used. If you are able to make such a language binding for a simple CC contract like faucet, this will be good for a 777 KMD bounty. Of course, you need to be the first to submit a properly working pull request.

@KomodoWorld the bounty you said for 25K, is it the same as described in chap13?

[26-Nov-18 07:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's a bounty I'm offering myself

[26-Nov-18 07:45 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I hadn't even read that part

[26-Nov-18 07:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
for instructions how it actually can be done you must ask James

[26-Nov-18 07:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, that was written when KMD was at least 2 or 3X current price, and i think is only for a single CC. The 25K bounty sounds like it's for more than just 1 CC

[26-Nov-18 07:49 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's for a full interpreter, not a single cc

[26-Nov-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
and you are not talking about Python which talks to RPC interface, you are talking about about an "interpreter"

[26-Nov-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
define exactly what you mean by that. Python that links to C code ?

[26-Nov-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
it would be much easier to have a python library that calls RPC functions to build CC's

[26-Nov-18 07:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
what is the point/value of linking to C/C++ ?

[26-Nov-18 07:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
WASM interpreter is different, it makes sense to be able to run code in a browser. But why Python?

[26-Nov-18 07:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
i believe there is a 25K KMD bounty for WASM CC interp, as well

[26-Nov-18 07:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
when James sets a bounty more than 777 KMD, you know it's going to be "fun" :abusedsmily:

[26-Nov-18 07:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes that is from me as well. for the python one I can't define it exactly because I'm not a developer... I believed it was almost the same thing

[26-Nov-18 07:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Perhaps James can better define what is required and what can be done
