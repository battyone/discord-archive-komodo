start with -debug=all

[11-Feb-19 12:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and read muillions of lines to work out what cause it

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm pretty sure you were told not to make a chain with that much supply... maybe it overflowed and sees an invalid block who knows

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and read muillions of lines to work out what cause it`
people do that? 😮

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have in the past

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when all els fails its like all you can do

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to see what path the code has taken

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL 99% of the shit I get stuck on is because I didn't ☹

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
same.. until I woreked out how to do it

[11-Feb-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😄

[11-Feb-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I know *how*, the interweb has just made me lazy

[11-Feb-19 12:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I worked out... you can make it sleep when as error happens and then you can catch it without reading every single line 👍

[11-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
haha okay

[11-Feb-19 12:05 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😄

[11-Feb-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are many tricks to working with this codebase that I dont thnk anyone has thaught of before... That ive figured out in the last few months...

[11-Feb-19 12:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
debug all 😄 not doing anything

[11-Feb-19 12:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094

LOL the qt wallet I'm working on has 0 results on virustotal.com for win and nix, but it has 6 hits for virus/trojan/malware for mac

[11-Feb-19 12:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[11-Feb-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when jl says not to do soething you should gnerally listen`

[11-Feb-19 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
please

[11-Feb-19 02:15 PM] D.rabbani#9094
help 😄

[11-Feb-19 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
@D.rabbani insight shows "waiting for blocks" when you first check the site but it usually fills up the blocks.

[11-Feb-19 02:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@PTYX  its not mate

[11-Feb-19 02:16 PM] PTYX#6840
If there are no blocks, then it will remain empty

[11-Feb-19 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thete are

[11-Feb-19 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
conn height is 291

[11-Feb-19 02:17 PM] D.rabbani#9094
there was an error before as well like about 4 months ago

[11-Feb-19 02:18 PM] PTYX#6840
Do you see other blocks?

[11-Feb-19 02:18 PM] PTYX#6840
Or any other info if you check for addresses or transactions?

[11-Feb-19 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[11-Feb-19 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i can see in my terminal the blocks are made

[11-Feb-19 02:19 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but it says waiting for block

[11-Feb-19 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm talking about the explorer itself

[11-Feb-19 02:20 PM] PTYX#6840
If you can't see any block data at all, then it's not communicating with the daemon

[11-Feb-19 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i can see block data

[11-Feb-19 02:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
😃

[11-Feb-19 02:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the transactions as well

still looking: Looking for a C dev to modify my stratum software to have sapling support. 1000KMD bounty. DM if interested

[11-Feb-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers How far off is your pool from stock when it comes to equihash? I know you've done quite a bit over the years, but is that bit "close" to stock?

[11-Feb-19 02:34 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
I don't think sapling is equihash related. it's more like some modifications for the block template, kinda like segwit...

[11-Feb-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's true-ish, but my question was more along the lines of "if I dl the stock bits and make it work, will it be plug-and-play- for your pool or will it need more mods?"

[11-Feb-19 02:36 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
I would expect that would just be fine

[11-Feb-19 02:37 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
this is pretty much the changes that were needed to have segwit configurable https://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp/commit/cbe55a3a84d24df0fda7b170552953b2cbfc7309

If I can remember how to run it (haven't touched it in almost 2 years 😛 ) I can take a look at it later this week if no one else can help

[11-Feb-19 02:40 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
k, I'll ping you if someone steps up before then

[11-Feb-19 02:41 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
not sure if there's a better place to be asking for this

[11-Feb-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not sure if there's a better place to be asking for this`
Not likely (at least not in Komodo discord), most of the rest of us are lazy and use NOMP forks 😛

[11-Feb-19 02:42 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
really thought it would be easier to find someone

[11-Feb-19 02:42 PM] jorian#4555
i have experienced that explorer bug too

[11-Feb-19 02:42 PM] jorian#4555
individual blocks and transactions are working fine, but the homepage stays empty

[11-Feb-19 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
no blocks, no transactions

[11-Feb-19 02:43 PM] jorian#4555
sometimes there are no blocks because the latest blocks were mined a day before, so it won't show up

[11-Feb-19 02:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pools are hard to find devs for in any language

yeah, I wish the original dev that did my equihash stuff would help me but he won't anymore. gave up on equihash

speaking of forks and variants, do you use equihashverify @! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers ?

[11-Feb-19 02:50 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
