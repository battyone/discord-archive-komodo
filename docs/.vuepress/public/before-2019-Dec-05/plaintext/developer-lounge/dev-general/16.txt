@dukeleto @Bryan_Beus  `tmTtqJP1tQfHNRLM6sz189p4wW2mzTjYk4b` does that look like a zcash address?  it's in regtest mode, `getnewaddress`

fwiw  - on a windows machine the chain etc are in the %appdata% shortcut folder.

[07-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
then users would need to delete the subfolders 'blocks' and 'chainstate' etc

[07-Sep-18 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @ttt at first looks like you typed when started your chain `-ac_name=` and `-addnode=`, also `-ac_cc` should be before `-ac_name`

[07-Sep-18 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
And `./komodo-cli` you have to call with `-ac_name` parameter to interact with your asset chain:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=E_CHAIN yourcall`

@TonyL  it's quite weird, because i thought that arguments will be parsed by name, thanks a lot for you answer

[07-Sep-18 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
@ttt üëç There is no argument `anode` so don't think your chain in synch atm.

Any impressions on hole punching and NAT traversal in peer-to-peer networks?
I'd like to gather a list of implementations we could look up to when tackling this in the future (in MM), maybe even reuse something.

[07-Sep-18 02:37 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
(I know that MAID has a hole punching p2p implementation in https://github.com/maidsafe/crust, for example, though their library has certain downsides).

[07-Sep-18 04:57 PM] ph03nix#3115
@artemciy_dice maybe I2P, ZeroNet, UPnP, DHT

[07-Sep-18 05:27 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Thanks, @ph03nix !

IIRC, DHT doesn't have it as a standard of any kind, but some of the major clients implement hole-punching extensions. Thing is, ŒºTorrent isn't OSS and it's hard to say where to look next. (P.S. Googling "*dht hole punching*" gives some POC-level OSS results though! - hyperdht, blunty)

UPnP is a separate thing and isn't as reliable AFAIK.

ZeroNet is on our radar, cool that you'd mention it, do you have any further intel?

I2P ( http://www.geti2p.org/todo.html#nat ) doesn't look like a real hole punching to me, and I'm reluctant to start with that kind of message routing because it raises a bunch of different questions, but come to think of it I should still add such message routing to the list.

[07-Sep-18 05:38 PM] ph03nix#3115
i wouldn't be of any further help with ZeroNet, but i will keep thinking of ideas

@dukeleto or @jl777c 

Mylo was able to help me get a regtest chain going.

Can either of you please help me understand this?

```

  "balance": 1012941229,
  "received": 1012941229
}
```
When we do `listaddressgroupings`, that address has 5.12 coins. 

But when we do `getaddressbalance`, that address has 10.29.

Is there something to understand about how a regtest chain works? Do I need to generate a few blocks after any transactions?

[07-Sep-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe confirmed vs unconfirmed?

[07-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm

[07-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It just updated...

[07-Sep-18 07:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Very weird.

[07-Sep-18 07:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, when I do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD generate 100`, am I mining new blocks?

If so, why doesn't that increase the confirmation count?

Or, is there some other mining process going on in the coin daemon that's making confirmations?

[07-Sep-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure about regtest mode

[07-Sep-18 07:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I'm writing documentation on this right now. I'll say `...shows confirmed balance for an address...`.

[07-Sep-18 08:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus yes, `generate 100` mines 100 blocks

[07-Sep-18 08:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
i've never actually used `listaddressgroupings` before

[07-Sep-18 08:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus one explanation is that something changed between the 2 commands, like maybe you ran generate in a different terminal and it wasn't finished yet

[07-Sep-18 08:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm. Ok, thank you @dukeleto

[07-Sep-18 08:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
can you reproduce that behavior, or does it work fine now?

[07-Sep-18 08:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's another question, this more out of my lack of familiarity with unix commands.

```
    # curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```

In the `curl` command example, I'm assuming I need to change the `http://127.0.0.1:7771/` to the port on my local host. 

I tried both the ports listed in my regtest chain, `9800` and `9801`, from what I saw on the coin daemon launch.

The first returned an error, and the second didn't have anything returned.

I deleted `--user myusername`, since I'm running it locally, but maybe that was a mistake, too.

How can I fix this, so that I can get a result?

[07-Sep-18 08:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
you need a password

[07-Sep-18 08:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
look at what your RPC password is in your conf file

[07-Sep-18 08:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
regtest has it's own rpc port, for KMD

[07-Sep-18 08:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus is this an asset chain in regtest mode, or KMD in regtest mode?

[07-Sep-18 08:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
7771 is a KMD port

[07-Sep-18 08:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ahh, I see

[07-Sep-18 08:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
and not regtest either

[07-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
does activating txindex and spentindex require a full resync or could I just stop KMD and restart with `komodod -txindex=1 -spentindex=1 -reindex`?

[07-Sep-18 08:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
our documentation doesn't show regtest port numbers, I believe it shows KMD ports, even if you use it on an AC

[07-Sep-18 08:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright full resync, baby

[07-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419

[07-Sep-18 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
got cha üòõ

[07-Sep-18 08:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a bug that seems related to a very recent BTC fix, where indexes can be built partially and turned on/off

[07-Sep-18 08:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
but for now, resync'ing is the foolproof way. I ran into weird errors without a resync

[07-Sep-18 08:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is why I say, if you think you need any index, just enable them all, so you will never have to do a full resync in case you want another index

[07-Sep-18 08:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
and if you want one, you probably will soon find they taste nice and want another

[07-Sep-18 08:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
They do look fun. üòÉ Can't wait to have some freetime to play around with some of the data.

[07-Sep-18 08:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto Another noob question: How do I put the password in there? does it go in `--user myusername`? And which port should I use, the p2p port, or the rpc port? (rpc, I'm guessing?)

[07-Sep-18 08:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
rpc port

[07-Sep-18 08:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I think you can do user:pass syntax

[07-Sep-18 08:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is curl syntax

[07-Sep-18 08:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it's `--user username:password`

[07-Sep-18 08:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's kind of amazing how fast these indexes are, all kinds of new possibilities open up when they are enabled

[07-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thanks, @dukeleto,

Still not getting a response. Do I need to indicate an output file?

[07-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or an output method?

[07-Sep-18 08:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
paste exact commands you are running and response

[07-Sep-18 08:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
if it's hanging, you are hitting the wrong port

[07-Sep-18 08:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you get a quick "nothing response", that is probably an incorrect password

[07-Sep-18 08:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
and make sure if your password has special characters, they might need to be escaped.

[07-Sep-18 08:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
it will just output text to your terminal if things are working. also, you can use `curl -v` to get more details

[07-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are the asset chain .conf files different from the main komodo.conf file?

[07-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, yep

[07-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
there, I see it

[07-Sep-18 08:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
in separate folders

[07-Sep-18 08:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let's see if this works

[07-Sep-18 08:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto That worked, thank you!

[07-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, there is one weird discrepancy...

[07-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
actually wait, nevermind, that was something from confirmations again

[07-Sep-18 08:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus sounds good

[07-Sep-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, every asset chain has it's own directory, such as ~/.komodo/AXO/AXO.conf

[07-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
gotcha, thanks

[07-Sep-18 08:58 PM] dukeleto#7326

[07-Sep-18 09:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
While I'm waiting on that one, I'm also working on `getaddressdeltas`.

I can get it to work if I don't include a `start` or `end` point, so, like this:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getaddressdeltas '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb"]}'
```
But if I try and add the start/end points, and also if I play around with the `chainInfo` boolean, I just get an error. I've tried switching between numbers and strings, leaving the boolean in and out, and using blockhashes instead of index numbers. 

Any tips?

I think I'm just making a JSON error.

A few of the combinations I've tried:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getaddressdeltas '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb"], 5, 260, true}'
```
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=SIDD getaddressdeltas '{"addresses": ["RTTg3izdeVnqkTTxjzsPFrdUQexgqCy1qb"], "013088bf85138371f97c71a712b5578be00fe52c12664bc0f2e2f8390b29a8be", "001fd35407abd8f4e2ec9734ce6f91d820ff553efcb9c39d657afed84da84963"}'

Gotcha. Good luck!

[08-Sep-18 12:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto @Alright @TonyL 

Working through some of our `addressindex` startup parameters. Need just some basic descriptions.

`-timestampindex`: I'm assuming this is simply an index of all timestamps (for blocks, transactions, etc.), just like the `addressindex` is for addresses.

`-unspentindex`: I'm assuming this is for utxos?
`-spentindex`: transactions, txids?

Also, on all of these, including `-addressindex`, does using this automatically trigger a full resync? Or do you have to delete manually?

[08-Sep-18 12:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus the error `{"result":null,"error":{"code":-32700,"message":"Parse error"},"id":null}` looks like a bug
