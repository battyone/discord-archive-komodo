it is more likely that you have less than 100 utxos

[12-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
since a utxo needs to be >100 blocks old, if you have less than 100 utxo, you will run out of eligible utxo and if the chain cant make more block, no existing utxo will become eligible

[12-Nov-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
in 100% PoS you have to spend effort to create utxo and preferably distribute to 64+ addresses

[12-Nov-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a reason PoW is more realiable than PoS and the initial distribution problem with PoS is one of its weaknesses

[12-Nov-18 12:53 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
Thanks @jl777c  this explains a lot

[12-Nov-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
with 100% PoS, the entire chain depends on the initial distribution, so you cant just put it all in one address and expect it to work, from a continue staking point but more specifically from a distribution point

64 utxos is enough to begin with, just don't set -pubkey on staking node, and block rewards will stake

[12-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
>64 wouldn't hurt through

[12-Nov-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
64 UTXOs on a couple separate nodes without -pubkey not set is most reliable

[12-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they said they need all the mined funds to go to a -pubkey

[12-Nov-18 02:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they need to set like 5000 utxo on 2 nodes ... and have a 3rd node receiving te funds

[12-Nov-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that isnt staking

[12-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
we need a better doc for it. I'll write up how I do it. There are plenty of ways to do it, but I've found what i do is reliable

[12-Nov-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
we could have some kind of time-out

[12-Nov-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
block hasn't happened in 2 hours? easy diff for a block

[12-Nov-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
although, that could be pretty dangerous if we aren't careful with it

Hey, anyone know when the hard fork will happen to introduce zcash overwinter signature support to Komodo

[12-Nov-18 02:55 PM] ulhaq.anwaar#2918
when we do getblanace64  it returns mature, immature, staking and  notstaking what does each one means?

[12-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mature means the total that is able to stake

[12-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
immature means hte total that cannot stake

[12-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
staking means staking, and the 64 values, are the amount in satoshies in each segid that is staking

[12-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not staking is what it says

[12-Nov-18 03:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can we split the reward on multiple pubkeys?

[12-Nov-18 03:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r  any idea üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
sure just send funds to whatever addresses you want to be staking with

[12-Nov-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
addresses with funds will stake

[12-Nov-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
addresses without funds wont stake

[12-Nov-18 03:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so in the command line do we need to add two pubkeys if we want to perform the operation ?

[12-Nov-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
one pubkey per node

[12-Nov-18 03:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like -pubkey = ****** -pubkey

[12-Nov-18 03:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[12-Nov-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
though you can have other addresses in the wallet

[12-Nov-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we will skip overwinter and go direct to sapling

[12-Nov-18 03:13 PM] BRENNY431#9209
Ok great thanks

[12-Nov-18 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a way to distrubute mined funds to the address's you want ...

[12-Nov-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont blindly use that ... if you can work it out and midify it to work for your use go for it

[12-Nov-18 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its on my lost of jobs to strip that out so it ONLY manages utxos rather than satistically distributing them to stake the most blocks.

[12-Nov-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its not a huge priorty for me atm.

[12-Nov-18 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i have `getsnapshot` in testing on Hush now, would you be able to have a Hush richlist on your awesome site, when it's done?

[12-Nov-18 04:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
Fancy - yes I can host the richtlist do you have an approx. idea of hoe many addresses there are with balance?

[12-Nov-18 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i had to kick of a fresh sync from scratch with all indexes last night, it's at about 90% now. I will let you know when I have some data in hand üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not like BTCH

[12-Nov-18 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX at the time of BTCH airdrop, Hush had 17618 addrs with a balance

[12-Nov-18 04:54 PM] CHMEX#0686
Great thanks thats sounds not like a problem than.

`getblockhashes`call for komodo-cli, has anyone used it before? i can't get it to work. when i read the help, it states to provide 2 timestamps as arguments, as well as a options json object: ```Arguments:
1. high         (numeric, required) The newer block timestamp
2. low          (numeric, required) The older block timestamp
3. options      (string, required) A json object
```
so i create this call: ```getblockhashes 1531440000 1531450209 '{"noOrphans":false, "logicalTimes":true}'``` but it returns: `No information available for block hashes.`

[12-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
then i switch the timestamps

[12-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
but the same result happens

[12-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
did you enable -timestampindex=1

[12-Nov-18 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
that, unfortunately, is not the case and is also not shown in help

[12-Nov-18 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
without timestamp indexes enabled it wont have any timestamp index info

[12-Nov-18 07:05 PM] jorian#4555
was it dukeleto who did all the help texts?

[12-Nov-18 07:05 PM] jorian#4555
should be added

[12-Nov-18 07:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jorian what did I do?

[12-Nov-18 07:39 PM] jorian#4555
i don't know who made the help texts, i thought it was you

[12-Nov-18 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
bitcore comes with help text for it's new RPCs, I may have touched/modified some

[12-Nov-18 07:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
some RPCs bail out with error if the proper indexes are not enabled

[12-Nov-18 07:42 PM] jorian#4555
well compared with the addressindex calls, there it states `(requires addressindex to be enabled).` behind the dexcription

[12-Nov-18 07:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't check if the index is enabled

[12-Nov-18 07:42 PM] jorian#4555
ok

[12-Nov-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
it should throw a more useful error, if the index is not enabled

[12-Nov-18 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
patches welcome!

[12-Nov-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
heh

[12-Nov-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
i'll make an issue

[12-Nov-18 07:43 PM] jorian#4555
üòõ

[12-Nov-18 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's 2 lines of code, you can copy from various other places

[12-Nov-18 07:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I know you can do it üòà

[12-Nov-18 07:44 PM] jorian#4555
of course

[12-Nov-18 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are various booleans, which you can do `if(!timestampIndexEnabled) { throw JSONRPCError ("you need foo index!"); }`

[12-Nov-18 07:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's in various RPCs. And yes, a Github Issue is good too üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 07:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is from upstream, they didn't check either

wow, that was new for #dev-general

[12-Nov-18 08:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
was about to ask if they took KMD, then it would maybe be vaguely relevant :abusedsmily:

A Question came up today....

[12-Nov-18 09:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Have there been any research papers or scientific work done to verify the efficiency/capabilities of dPoW

[12-Nov-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
in concept it is simple. checkpoints work. dPoW creates checkpoints dynamically using a stochastic process among elected notaries

[12-Nov-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been field tested

[12-Nov-18 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
in addition to a lot of internal testing

[12-Nov-18 10:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts we had free public livestreamed pentests by motivated attackers, who failed üòÉ

[12-Nov-18 10:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think those have even more value than academic papers, but we could use some of those too

[12-Nov-18 10:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts it would be nice to verify that dpow was implemented correctly on various external coins, not all coins with dpow have been attacked since adding it. Is there funding available for writing up a paper? I haz LaTeX skillz üòÉ

how do I see z transactions, and not t transactions?

[13-Nov-18 12:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
when I do `listtransactions`, I only get t transactions?

[13-Nov-18 12:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm, that's an idea...

[13-Nov-18 12:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
alas, no luck

[13-Nov-18 12:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have this wallet.dat file from another computer. It had a few z transactions I was doing with it.

I backed up the wallet.date file, and then wiped down the computer for some other experiment.

Placed this wallet.dat file on another computer and resynced the blockchain. 

All of the z operationids disappeared.

[13-Nov-18 12:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And one of my transactions never went through, so I'm trying to see what happened to it, but I can't find the operation id.

[13-Nov-18 12:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
they don't save to local memory?

[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
damn

[13-Nov-18 12:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
how can I pull up old transactions?
