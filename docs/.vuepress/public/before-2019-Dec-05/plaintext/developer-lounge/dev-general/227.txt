[28-Sep-19 07:45 AM] Oszy#5734
we just told you z_listreceivedbyaddress and z_listunspent

[28-Sep-19 07:45 AM] gcharang#6833
z_listunspent ( minconf maxconf includeWatchonly ["zaddr", ...] )
set the maxconf to a value you like to get only the recent ones

[28-Sep-19 07:45 AM] Oszy#5734
try these see if that's what you are looking for

[28-Sep-19 07:46 AM] lc123456#5516
address is too many

[28-Sep-19 07:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Also, `z_listoperationids` might have what you need for recent transactions.

[28-Sep-19 07:47 AM] lc123456#5516
i work on the exchange

[28-Sep-19 07:48 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to log user balances then with z_listreceivedbyaddress

[28-Sep-19 07:48 AM] lc123456#5516
i need has filter condition interface

[28-Sep-19 07:48 AM] gcharang#6833
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listunspent 1 100 true "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\",\"zxxxxx\",\"zyyyyyyy\",]"
```

[28-Sep-19 07:48 AM] lc123456#5516
but we  address is too many

[28-Sep-19 07:49 AM] gcharang#6833
run the command for each address and store the value?

[28-Sep-19 07:49 AM] lc123456#5516
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listunspent 1 100 true "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\",\"zxxxxx\",\"zyyyyyyy\",]"  this order

[28-Sep-19 07:49 AM] lc123456#5516
if node is down,and confirm number more 100, will i miss some tx?

[28-Sep-19 07:50 AM] lc123456#5516
@gcharang

[28-Sep-19 07:50 AM] gcharang#6833
make sure the bolckchain is in sync when you are giving the command

[28-Sep-19 07:52 AM] Oszy#5734
Are you running ARRR node?

[28-Sep-19 07:53 AM] gcharang#6833
you will only get txns that have upto 100 confirmations
also, this command only gives "unspent transactions" not all transactions

[28-Sep-19 07:54 AM] Oszy#5734
log everything internally in a db all the time, as soon as tx coming in, and opid-s when going out and everything will be fine

[28-Sep-19 07:55 AM] lc123456#5516
if i use it,and i cant search by z_listunspent interface

[28-Sep-19 07:56 AM] lc123456#5516
how can i search opids?

[28-Sep-19 07:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
`z_getoperationstatus`

[28-Sep-19 07:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
will return all current opids

[28-Sep-19 07:57 AM] Oszy#5734
then `z_getoperationresult (["operationid", ... ])` to see status

[28-Sep-19 07:58 AM] Oszy#5734
opid-s are only local not on the chain so always log them

[28-Sep-19 07:58 AM] lc123456#5516
but first i dont has operationid

[28-Sep-19 07:59 AM] lc123456#5516
if someone has one  deposit

[28-Sep-19 07:59 AM] Oszy#5734
opid is created when you make an operation like z_sendmany

[28-Sep-19 07:59 AM] lc123456#5516
i cant know this tx operation id

[28-Sep-19 07:59 AM] lc123456#5516
deposit

[28-Sep-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Do as DukeLeto suggested to get the opid

[28-Sep-19 08:00 AM] lc123456#5516
someone send coin to my exchange

[28-Sep-19 08:00 AM] Oszy#5734
no it is not for deposits (incoming)

[28-Sep-19 08:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh

[28-Sep-19 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
that someone has an address right? so as we said before, you can use `z_listreceivedbyaddress "address" ( minconf )` and `z_listunspent 1 100 true "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\",\"zxxxxx\",\"zyyyyyyy\",]"`

[28-Sep-19 08:01 AM] gcharang#6833
you give each user adifferent z-address as deposit address correct?

[28-Sep-19 08:01 AM] Oszy#5734
if you want to run this on multiple addresses put the command in a loop

[28-Sep-19 08:02 AM] Oszy#5734
@mrlynch are you with us? üòÑ I think he has a "guide" of some sort for exchanges how to handle z-tx's üôÇ

[28-Sep-19 08:03 AM] gcharang#6833
you give a user this deposit address:  zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z
to check if the deposit arrived, run
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listunspent 1 100 true "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\"]"
```
in a loop with a timeout of say 10 seconds
any deposits to this address will be credited to the user
change the 1 to the minimum number of confs you choose

‚òù 

[28-Sep-19 08:05 AM] lc123456#5516
?

[28-Sep-19 08:06 AM] lc123456#5516
what should i do ?

[28-Sep-19 08:06 AM] gcharang#6833
and change max confs from 100 to 9999999
because, if you change the deposit address for every  user, there won't be too many txns to this address

[28-Sep-19 08:07 AM] lc123456#5516
use this z_listunspent  interface

[28-Sep-19 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@lc123456 which part of my last two messages did you not understand?

[28-Sep-19 08:10 AM] lc123456#5516
and change max confs from 100 to 9999999

[28-Sep-19 08:10 AM] lc123456#5516
it will return me  too message

[28-Sep-19 08:10 AM] lc123456#5516
more than 100 confirm tx, all return me

[28-Sep-19 08:11 AM] lc123456#5516
and will time out

[28-Sep-19 08:11 AM] gcharang#6833
you don't need to filter for maxconfs because you have given this address to only one user

[28-Sep-19 08:11 AM] gcharang#6833
did you try it and it timed out?

[28-Sep-19 08:12 AM] lc123456#5516
has chinese?

[28-Sep-19 08:12 AM] lc123456#5516
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listunspent 100 99999 false "[\"zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z\"]"

[28-Sep-19 08:12 AM] lc123456#5516
like this?

[28-Sep-19 08:12 AM] gcharang#6833
someone in the community might know chinese
I am not aware of anyone in the team

[28-Sep-19 08:14 AM] gcharang#6833
yes
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listunspent 100 99999 false "["zs1wqykmk74mv2ezjscpxsgzrn4fasqwh50tgk0ym64m45c5yw5fjtpkps64gle963veqzuj04872z"]"
```
in the above command,
100 is the minimum number of confirmations you are expecting
99999 is the maximum number of confirmations you want to filter

[28-Sep-19 08:15 AM] lc123456#5516
for example

[28-Sep-19 08:16 AM] lc123456#5516
z_listunspent  it will filter unspent

[28-Sep-19 08:16 AM] lc123456#5516
if i spent it, this interface cant search it

[28-Sep-19 08:16 AM] lc123456#5516
this right?

[28-Sep-19 08:16 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[28-Sep-19 08:17 AM] lc123456#5516
this not i need

[28-Sep-19 08:17 AM] gcharang#6833
if you spent it, use
z_listreceivedbyaddress

[28-Sep-19 08:17 AM] gcharang#6833
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=BEER z_listreceivedbyaddress "ztfaW34Gj9FrnGUEf833ywDVL62NWXBM81u6EQnM6VR45eYnXhwztecW1SjxA7JrmAXKJhxhj3vDNEpVCQoSvVoSpmbhtjf"
```

[28-Sep-19 08:17 AM] lc123456#5516
we has thousands of users

[28-Sep-19 08:18 AM] lc123456#5516
param send thousands of  addresss?

[28-Sep-19 08:18 AM] lc123456#5516
dont has like "listtransactions" ?

[28-Sep-19 08:18 AM] gcharang#6833
no, repeat this same command thousands of times

[28-Sep-19 08:19 AM] lc123456#5516
this not good idea

[28-Sep-19 08:19 AM] CrisF#3405
fyi, PIRATE has a Chinese channel: `https://discordapp.com/channels/512188534111862784/519706426810302466`

[28-Sep-19 08:19 AM] lc123456#5516
no

[28-Sep-19 08:19 AM] CrisF#3405
They deal in `Z`

[28-Sep-19 08:20 AM] lc123456#5516
if you can know i said

[28-Sep-19 08:20 AM] lc123456#5516
i dont need chinese

[28-Sep-19 08:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Why don't you like @gcharang's suggestion?

[28-Sep-19 08:21 AM] lc123456#5516
execute  z_listreceivedbyaddress  ervery time?

[28-Sep-19 08:21 AM] Oszy#5734
it's the only way to do it

[28-Sep-19 08:21 AM] Oszy#5734
that is how z works

[28-Sep-19 08:23 AM] lc123456#5516
zcash is private

[28-Sep-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
zcash is both private and transparent, it's optional

[28-Sep-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
Pirate is only private

[28-Sep-19 08:23 AM] lc123456#5516
xmr

[28-Sep-19 08:23 AM] lc123456#5516
grin

[28-Sep-19 08:24 AM] Oszy#5734
where is this conversation going now?

[28-Sep-19 08:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm not understanding @lc123456.

[28-Sep-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
xmr and grin are completely different protocols
you can see in this page: <https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/payment_api.html>
all the available z- commands

[28-Sep-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
z-cash doesn't have any more methods to deal with z-addresses

[28-Sep-19 08:25 AM] lc123456#5516
can you support a good suggestion?

can you support a good suggestion?
```
what do you mean?
we have given you what we think are the only methods to do it
maybe join the Pirate discord? they have helped many exchanges integrate z-addresses
they might have better methods
https://discord.gg/rtWbQDk

[28-Sep-19 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
A script to implement gcharang's suggestion is what I would try.

[28-Sep-19 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Also check other sources like ‚òù and see how they are doing it.

[28-Sep-19 08:29 AM] lc123456#5516
i need you help

[28-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Oszy#5734
good idea or not, you have to do it, there is no other way

[28-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Oszy#5734
