best to figure out something else to entice newsletters subsriptions. bring back the tech tuesdays!

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I think our solution will be to post the TT updates to the websites a few weeks after we email it out the email list

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I hear you though guys, not everyone likes email, just as not everyone likes Twitter or FB or whatever other platform

[06-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We def want to cater to everyone's preference

[06-Aug-19 01:04 PM] crumb#2550
it would make sense to wait a day or two, but two weeks seems waaay too long

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] crumb#2550
me talking about twitter was just an example. i'm not talking about twitter specifically. my issues is with holding back valuable information for questionable benefit of gaining a few more subscribers

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We won't be holding back any information tho

[06-Aug-19 01:06 PM] Daniel CP#2020
For the most part, TT updates were a weekly round up of what was already public in other places

[06-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Discord, Twitter, etc

[06-Aug-19 01:07 PM] crumb#2550
so send out newsletter monday evening and post to website tuesday evening. simple 😃

[06-Aug-19 01:07 PM] Daniel CP#2020
All important developments will def, 100% be published on the website ASAP

[06-Aug-19 01:08 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Well the newsletter is Fridays but I still hear you

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll talk with the team about all this, nothing is set in stone

[06-Aug-19 01:09 PM] crumb#2550
website is "ideal" place for pointing others to get official info from. lowest barrier by far

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] crumb#2550
even if i prefer discord and twitter myself

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I agree. The analytics suggest that very few people were reading TTs tbh

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] crumb#2550
no reason to cut them

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Daniel CP#2020
So we were hoping to maximize the value of that content

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Not cut them, just send them to the people that really want to read them

[06-Aug-19 01:10 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And create demand for the newsletter

[06-Aug-19 01:11 PM] crumb#2550
regular weekly updates go a long way towards building trust into team. shows continuous development and dedication

[06-Aug-19 01:12 PM] crumb#2550
do you have numbers to suggest that when sent out as newsletter it will be actually read more?

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Yep

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Well, the email list as a whole. Not totally sure about the Dev persona specifically

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] crumb#2550
it will go out to a bunch of mailboxes, but interacting with it is what matters

[06-Aug-19 01:13 PM] Daniel CP#2020
We have 9K on the email list and typically about 1700 to 1800 people open it

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] Daniel CP#2020
TTs were getting less than 1K page views

[06-Aug-19 01:14 PM] crumb#2550
hmm, yes

[06-Aug-19 01:15 PM] crumb#2550
1k page views is not a lot, but there are more benefits than direct reads. for example the 'trust' factor that Komodo is making progress + SEO value and other stuff

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Daniel CP#2020
I think the trust factor, promoting transparency about what's going on and what we're focused on, that's important. Agree 100%

[06-Aug-19 01:16 PM] Daniel CP#2020
The SEO value is limited unless we target high-volume keywords, which is really tough when the development dictates the topic of the content

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Also, should we move this convo to talk-marketing? Just realized we're clogging up th dev channel 😅

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] crumb#2550
it's not really limited, but long-winded

[06-Aug-19 01:17 PM] crumb#2550
yes, it occurred to me too 😂

need some quick help with python please 🙂

[08-Aug-19 05:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```python
p_math = 2**256 - 2**32 - 2**9 - 2**8 - 2**7 - 2**6 - 2**4 - 2**0
```

[08-Aug-19 05:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what does `**` means here?

[08-Aug-19 05:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that equals to `^` ?

[08-Aug-19 05:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
python prints this for this code:
```python
p_math = 2**256 - 2**32 - 2**9 - 2**8 - 2**7 - 2**6 - 2**4 - 2**0
print(p_math)

OUTPUT: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663
```

If I use `^` with go, it doesn't print that same output
```go
p_math := 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 2^0
fmt.Println(p_math)

OUTPUT: 284

@CHMEX been making some progress on zxtns stats, still more work to be done, but it's coming along: `https://github.com/MyHush/hush3/pull/27/files`

[08-Aug-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX take a look at the heuristics and definitions and tell me if they make sense, or if you want to modify or add different ones

[08-Aug-19 05:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly I have done the low level data collection, haven't modified the RPC yet

[08-Aug-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
no idea of performance costs of this, either. But I wrote it with performance in mind. Instead of looking at data multiple times, we do all the things we need to do with it, when we iterate thru it once

[08-Aug-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX should amount=0 output be considered a payment? Or only amount > 0 ?

[08-Aug-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
My code only deals with Sapling stuff for now, not sprout stuff

[08-Aug-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
so for instance, this code would work fine in KMD, but not for old historical data, only new sapling-only data

[08-Aug-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
my code can deal with groth16 joinsplits, but not old-style sprout joinsplits, that doubles the code, roughly

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
because all those variables and functions are different

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
so for now, I ignore old sprout junk

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
that can be added once this gets PR'ed into KMD

[08-Aug-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
most people only care about current stats and future stats, so it's not a very big deal. But it would be nice to generate historical stats to compare against.

Thanks Emmanuel 
Yes I use the math.Pow() from go to get same result. Since the 2, 256 is long answer it gives big int, and others are short so those are returned as either float64 or int, so I am not getting correct subtraction value. Just figuring out that in go now. Felt it odd that with go I have to do extra work to get same results. @Deleted User

atom or pycharm (but better atom than pycharm - for atom you can install needed plugins to work with both C++ and Python, but in pycharm C++ you'll use notepad-like way 😃 )

Is it possible to develop CDP (collateral debt position) on Komodo using some Antara modules? Similar projects are MakerDAO and it's DAI stable coin.
CDP offers big benefits for base token holders. Holders are not forced to sell their tokens. They can create over collateralized stable coins. This way the can avoid temporary liquidity crisis, use the token to pay for bills without selling the token itself, which could trigger tax event.
They can even buy more base token with stable coin, thus using it as small leverage to increase buy pressure.
