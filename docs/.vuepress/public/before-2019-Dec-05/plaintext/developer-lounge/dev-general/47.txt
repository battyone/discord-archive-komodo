what we need to do to overcome it ?

[30-Oct-18 11:34 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and other question is

[30-Oct-18 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want to mine the chain, you have to specify the parameters like that

[30-Oct-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have added  the node of my partners ip like -addnode= partner ipv4 address ? why the balance is zero on his node ?

[30-Oct-18 11:35 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes please like what i need to do to specify the parameters

[30-Oct-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to have the privkey imported for the pubkey you are using on each node

[30-Oct-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
90% staking and 10% mining
```
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=MGNX -ac_supply=12465003 -ac_staked=90 -ac_reward=2000000000 -ac_halving=525960 -ac_cc=2 -ac_end=2629800 -addnode=142.93.27.180 &
```
100% mining
```
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232 &
```
50% pre-mined + 50% minable
```
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 &
```

[30-Oct-18 11:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i am getting all the balance of the mined coins can you please help me @SHossain  i am really stuck with it

[30-Oct-18 11:36 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so in case of 100% pos it will stop at 100 thats it

[30-Oct-18 11:37 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so the phenomenon is first 100 blocks will be mined as POW and after that POS will take place

[30-Oct-18 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Oct-18 11:37 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and also i need to ask you that why the balance is zero on the partners node ?

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to have the privkey imported for the pubkey you are using on each node

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
use that

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
on the staking node

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
then do `setgenerate true 0`

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okay @Alright

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
you need to do it before block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:38 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it is the segmentation right?

[30-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Alright#0419
when I start them, I stop it after 2 blocks mined, distribute some of the premine to 64 address, then start staking and mining

[30-Oct-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai so i need to run this

[30-Oct-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thats absolutely fine

[30-Oct-18 11:39 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but d you know that why my partners node is not recieving any balance

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
although i am giving his pubkey and his node address while mining

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
is he on the same chain?

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
you sure he has it imported/

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
the address

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes pretty sure mate

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
can you look at debug.log of each node

[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
and make sure latest block hashes match

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no the problem is the balance is coming generating in my node

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
all the balance i am getting it for the mined blocks

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
along with the rewards as well

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it shouldnt happen right ?

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
so you want to mine to his pubkey?

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what you're saying

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
is he mining blocks and it's paying you?

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
or you want to mine blocks and pay him?

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no on his node he is not mining at all

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we are just in a testing phase

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so the scenario is my node is mining and his should just recieive

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] D.rabbani#9094
can i be able to achieve it ?

[30-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
get a pubkey from his wallet and set it at start up your node

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
with -pubkey

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
should watch out though

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
how can you please elaborate it with the example really thankful to you guys with your frequent responses

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
because that will make change addresses his address

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
can't you just send him coins?

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but we didi that right  i mean if you can look at the above code

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we did

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
or have him mine?

[30-Oct-18 11:43 AM] D.rabbani#9094
./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=PINA -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_staked=100 -pukey=03ad303ce5229f15e7170653e6ee084f8f57cb16880bbc6a5f37444b94a7d2906c -addnode=192.168.0.121  -gen -genproclimit=0 &

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
so that's his pubkey?

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
and you're running it?

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
ok

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i am running on my node

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
do `komodo-cli -ac_name=PINA getblocktemplate`

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and by default we do cc=1 what is this ccc

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
it'll output a raw transaction somewhere in there

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] Alright#0419
do `decoderawtransaction <rawtx>`

[30-Oct-18 11:44 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
do you see his pubkey?

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but we have deleted it at the moment

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
on local host

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thing is we are just in a testing phas

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
phase

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yesterday it was mining to his address

[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
if you have his pubkey set and use sendtoaddress, the change will go to him

[30-Oct-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes i have got his pubkey

[30-Oct-18 11:46 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and set it before

[30-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
do you understand what I mean by the change will go to him?

[30-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Alright#0419
you'll send the rest of the UTXO to his address each time you send coins

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
with his pubkey set

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
orite okay okay Thanks

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so on my node ill run like this

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
./komodod -ac_cc=1 -ac_name=PINA -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_supply=10000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_staked=100 -pukey=03ad303ce5229f15e7170653e6ee084f8f57cb16880bbc6a5f37444b94a7d2906c -addnode=192.168.0.121  -gen -genproclimit=0 &

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
correct

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
you need to do genproclimit=1 on a node at creation

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Alright#0419
stop it after block 2

[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and also the &  in the last has dismantled the process

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Alright#0419
distribute coins with the scripts I posted above

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okay

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Alright#0419
then `setgenerate true 0` on the node your distributed coins to

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Alright#0419
and `setgenerate true 1` on another node until after block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so setgenerate true will be on the first node ?

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and setgenerate 1 will be on my node

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
corect

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
need 2 nodes until block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
setgenerate true 1 on the node that isn't staking

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
setgenerate true 0 to stake on the node you distribute coins on

[30-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Alright#0419
you can stop the `setgenerate true 1` node after block 100 if it's 100% POS

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, actually I'm not entirely sure you need the POW node until 100 on 100% pos

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
will have to test it sometime

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
but for now if it's stuck before 100, it's likely that
