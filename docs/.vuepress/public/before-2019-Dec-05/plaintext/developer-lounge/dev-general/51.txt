@blackjok3r I think something like ` if( strcmp("REGTEST",ccdata.symbol) == 0 && blockheight%10==0) { notarized=1; }` maybe be exactly what I need to make it think every 10th block is notarized

[05-Nov-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
NOTARIZED_HASH and NOTARIZED_TXID might not get set correctly, but mostly I want to test dpowconfs, which doesn't need to look at txid or hash

[05-Nov-18 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r Hush does not have exactly the same code, but I think I can port it over to Hush

[05-Nov-18 02:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes just make those functions that check if the op_return data is valid, say yes if regtest

[05-Nov-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i have something like this that I am going to try in Hush: ```--- a/src/komodo_validation011.h
+++ b/src/komodo_validation011.h
@@ -1224,6 +1224,8 @@ void komodo_connectblock(CBlockIndex *pindex,CBlock& block)
             numvalid = bitweight(signedmask);
             if ( numvalid >= KOMODO_MINRATIFY )
                 notarized = 1;
+            if ( Params().NetworkIDString() == "regtest" && ( height%7 == 0) )

[05-Nov-18 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r figured it would be too easy. I think the local `notarized` variable is being set but that never makes it to the globals that the rest of the system uses. But it feels like I am close

[05-Nov-18 04:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I just set all the NOTARIZED_ globals right there

[05-Nov-18 04:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No there is another flag called valid =

[05-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to set that... wher I showed you the PIZZA exception

[05-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely is just a bit further down maybe

[05-Nov-18 04:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe you cant set tx with 0 op_return as valid though

[05-Nov-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r these are coinbase xtns, too

[05-Nov-18 04:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r in regtest, the only xtns in my blocks are coinbase. Maybe if I make non-coinbase xtns, those will work

[05-Nov-18 04:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r something probably is smart enough to ignore coinbase xtns, when looking for ntz's, maybe I can fake that too 😃

[05-Nov-18 04:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think it does that, as when I was getting stked working at the start, it would say all mined blocks by a notary pubkey were notarised.. but not valid notarisations .. only got to the first round of checks.

@jl777c have you seen this "zPoS" from PIVX stuff? they claim to have private/stealth staking: https://pivx.org/zpos/

[05-Nov-18 06:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think zerocoin protocol doesnt shield amounts and that allows calulating stake

"notarized" blocks in regtest! Every 7th block in regtest is automagically notarized, in honor of @jl777c

[05-Nov-18 07:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
this allows testing dpowconfs and various other things related to dpow

[05-Nov-18 07:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
the above is working in Hush, once it's all shiny with some nice passing tests, I will port that to KMD

[05-Nov-18 08:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo notice how `confirmations` and `rawconfirmations` are different

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
that xtn really has 2 "raw" confirmations, but it's not notarized, so dpowconfs holds the confirmations at 1

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is a coinbase xtn with 102 confirmations, and since it's been notarized, rawconfirmations = confirmations

[05-Nov-18 08:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is all in regtest

passing dpowconfs tests in regtest mode!

[05-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Mylo#8306
boom 💥 
i like the equals check rather than introduce flags.
if i was writing a web component for dpow conf, is `listunspent` the only way to get this data for now?
looks like a handy lot of python for the dev community there 😃

[05-Nov-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
seems you don't have it activated

[05-Nov-18 09:35 PM] Alright#0419
it should add "rawconfirmations"

[05-Nov-18 10:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo in komodo, you have to be on master or fsm branch

[05-Nov-18 10:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo you are probably on `dev`, which I don't think has dpowconfs yet

[05-Nov-18 10:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo there are a handful of RPCs that changed with dpowconfs, anything that had a `confirmations` key now has that and `rawconfirmations`

hi i am just having a concern about the ./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8 are these the threads of the core or the aplication level  threads can someone explain it please

[06-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
number of threads used for building

[06-Nov-18 01:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so if  i  use j4 ?? i just need to know whether they are cpu threads or application threads

[06-Nov-18 01:44 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[06-Nov-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
CPU threads

[06-Nov-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
-j4 will take twice as long as -j8 if you have 8 cores

[07-Nov-18 07:16 AM] D.rabbani#9094
hi just a question while practicing .. if i want to get a block reward of 2.3% per year i.e. 5.29 mil /year how should i calculate the reward ? i am just confused

[07-Nov-18 07:17 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and what is ac_end ?

[07-Nov-18 07:18 AM] D.rabbani#9094
"for eg  ./komodod -ac_name=examplecoin   -ac_supply= 2300000000  -ac_reward= 367361111111   -ac_staked=100  -ac_cc=1  -ac_end=9799621"

[07-Nov-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_end is when the blockrewards end

[07-Nov-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the -ac_reward is the blockreward in satoshis

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you can also use -ac_decay to reduce the blockreward incrementally

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also -ac_halving

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
plz read the docs on this

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes read it

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but my question is did i calculate it right ? the block reward

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use getblocksubsidy <height> to verify the blockreward at a height

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
given an expanding supply and a fixed reward, the percentage wont be constant

[07-Nov-18 07:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
will it generate 5.29 mil /year ?

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
blocktime of 60 seconds

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
1440 per day

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
1440*365 per year

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
1440*365 * blockreward per year

[07-Nov-18 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
you can do the math

[07-Nov-18 07:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
525600

[07-Nov-18 07:27 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it is

[07-Nov-18 07:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
if i want to keep 3.3% reward per year

[07-Nov-18 07:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
it will be 1440*365*0.033 ? right

[07-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for the first year, but the supply is increasing, so the percentage will decrease

[07-Nov-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
I think a negative -ac_decay is needed to increase the blockreward over time, but that is not implemented

[07-Nov-18 07:45 AM] D.rabbani#9094
no i just want to keep it fix just as 3.3% per year

[07-Nov-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Nov-18 07:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i got it

[07-Nov-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
to keep a constant percentage, you would need to change the blockreward based on coinsupply

[07-Nov-18 07:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai

[07-Nov-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but with an ever changing blockreward, keeping track of that becomes problematic

[07-Nov-18 07:48 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the coin supply for example say 2.3 billion

[07-Nov-18 07:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and 2.3% will be block reward /year

[07-Nov-18 07:49 AM] D.rabbani#9094
out of it
