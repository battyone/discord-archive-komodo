build komodod before building cclib - or build cclib as part of komodo to reuse the libs/deps from komodo/depends

[02-Mar-19 02:42 PM] ca333#0118
for hackings and mad scientists experiments you can also just install libboost through package manager

[02-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Alright#0419
Does it build cclib.so by just running `build.sh`?

[02-Mar-19 03:09 PM] Alright#0419
I need to do some tests, but I was experiencing problems with it. On a fresh clone, just `build.sh` would work. However after this I needed to do 
```
cd ~/komodo/src/cc
./makecclib
cd ..
make
../zcutil/build.sh```

@Alright  revert boost in the boost.mk file to 1.66 from 1.69 then it works without installing system boost.

[03-Mar-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure why it keeps getting changed to 1.69 when that fails to build... I have to keep reverting LABS back to 1.66 to keep build.sh reliable.

[03-Mar-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r did that come in from a vrsc merge?

[03-Mar-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No

[03-Mar-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just had a fun problem to solve with `git` and I want to share it in here

[03-Mar-19 12:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a fail to build for cclib

[03-Mar-19 12:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ca333 upgraded all our deps, and boost 1.69 seesms to break cclib building, unles you ahve sysrtem boost installed.. Drove me metla on LABS with some users reporting build failed, and others saying ti works lol

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
in the end I did some hacky things, and reverted boost, to get a stable build... its definatly not how its meant to be fixed but it works so until its fixed upstream ... we will use hax. üòÉ

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
ok, should i remove libboost-dev from the deps?

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
My dpowminconfs branch is kind of old and I can't even remember if I based it off of the dev or jl777 branches. So I used `git merge-base` to find the common ancestors to each branch. Then I saw jl777 was the newer ancestor, and so I know to merge jl777 branch into my dpowminconfs branch

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
(loki)(~/git/komodo dpowminconfs $% )$ git merge-base dpowminconfs jl777
76024c356eae352b03c91ec78a611a4761f8311b

```

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here

[03-Mar-19 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not a git command i use all the time, but it's super handy, especially in scripting git

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
`ok, should i remove libboost-dev from the deps?` YES.

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you dont need it...

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
you can use `build.sh` one time on a fresh clone, it builds cclib.so properly

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
after the first time, you must do some janky things

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you jsut need boost to be the correct version... or someone needs to swork out what exact code is failing to build with 1.69 and fix that.

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
isntalling boost as a dep is a hack... its wrong

[03-Mar-19 12:25 PM] Alright#0419
it seems like it's rebuilding libcc.so, but it doesn't from what I can tell

[03-Mar-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
it sounds like libcc build system is janky

[03-Mar-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its broken flat out.

[03-Mar-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
i made it work on os x in a hacky way, i am partially to blame

[03-Mar-19 12:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
but i just added some shine to the top

[03-Mar-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like the build system doesn't understand that some files are generated or need to be taken into account when recompiling

[03-Mar-19 12:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's an age-old problem

[03-Mar-19 12:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not really... Everyone is using diffrent hacks to get it to work. I have what seems to be very reliable on linux atm with LABS  but I know I didnt do it properly... its using build.sh to call manual builds scripts in the correct place. and I reverted deps, so that they build on every system.

[03-Mar-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its not even using a MakeFile

[03-Mar-19 12:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just bash scripts

[03-Mar-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright are these partial compiles or fresh compiles, after a make clean?

[03-Mar-19 12:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
those are different code paths, to the build system

[03-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
the error I posted above was from a fresh VPS I was trying to do ./makecclib on

[03-Mar-19 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes its due to using boost 1.69

[03-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
like I said, it built libso.so once

[03-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
but then after I made some changes and went to rebuild it

[03-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Alright#0419
I was getting that error message

revert that

and it will build woithout isntalling boost

[03-Mar-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
installing boost is covering up the problem

[03-Mar-19 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not fixing it

[03-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419
ok, for now I'll revert adding libboost-dev to deps

[03-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Alright#0419

i am fighting linking bugs in old compilers already

[03-Mar-19 12:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah the reasoning of mine to merge LABS into main KMD was to stoip it ahving lists of 20-30 conflicts every time we try to merge down FSM

[03-Mar-19 12:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
this has been 20X harder than it should be, to finish

[03-Mar-19 12:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r learn more git-fu and you can reduce that stuff, but there will always be some

[03-Mar-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes for asure... atm I found using atom text editor as a GUI for GIT is a lot more powerful than my skills on cli, at least for now

[03-Mar-19 12:35 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but definatly need to work on that.

[03-Mar-19 12:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
looks like this first conflict is because we both added to the bottom of the komodo_defs.h file

[03-Mar-19 12:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
FUN GIT FACT

[03-Mar-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
Git cannot auto-resolve a conflict if you add something to the end of "hunk" of text, but if you randomly insert into the middle, it won't create these conflicts

[03-Mar-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
did a bunch of stuff get added to rpcwallet.cpp?

[03-Mar-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it's just this `test_proof` function, the merge conflict markers looked weird

[03-Mar-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
I need to figure out what the actual cause of it was

[03-Mar-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
that version of boost could have a bug, and/or our build system could be too dumb for the use case we are providing it

[03-Mar-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
neither would surprise me

[03-Mar-19 12:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Alright I told you what the actaul cause of it is

[03-Mar-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But I wasnt able to work out what line of code exactly is failing to link to boost

[03-Mar-19 12:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so reverting bosot was the only option
