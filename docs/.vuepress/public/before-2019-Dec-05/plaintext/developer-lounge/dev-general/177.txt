on some assetnames you need a <br> I think when the assetname is too large otherwise it looks weird... mybe that could be handled nicer with a specific css idk

if "confirmations" is > 1, it is notarized

@gcharang is that live or a mock up? 6 notary confs and 0 confs confuses me

[24-May-19 12:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
did you manage to get that notarized data into the insight-api-komodo module somehow?
I went to the code and was not really sure how it works almost looked like that whole framework internally keeps track of the confirmations.

@CHMEX 
I am currently editing the file:
```
LABSRCTEST-explorer/node_modules/insight-ui-komodo/public/views/transaction/tx.html
```

[24-May-19 01:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i have been thinking lately of explorers and confs and rawconfs and dpowconfs. The situation is very very confusing, even as somebody who wrote dpowconfs

[24-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
or at least a big chunk of it

[24-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX let's say I make a transaction, and it has 2 raw confirmations, but no notarization

[24-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
now I look at an explorer

[24-May-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
the explorer shows me 2 confirmations, because it uses rawconfs

[24-May-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
but when I look at my exchange/app/etc, it shows me unconfirmed!!!

[24-May-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
This has confused me before, so it definitely confuses end users and exchanges and people building apps on top of dpow coins

[24-May-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX which is why I agree with you, that explorers should clarify rawconfs vs dpowconfs, until it's notarized, and then those concepts are the same

[24-May-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it should show 1 confirm, not as unconfirmed

[24-May-19 02:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@CHMEX you were right
it wasn't querying the daemon for the txn, it was manually creating the txn using bitcore-node and bitcore-lib
so from insight-api to insight-ui a newly constructed transaction comes, so the rawconfirmations vs confirmations difference is lost there and there isn't even a field called rawconfs in the insight api's output
for example for getting confs, they are using
```
var confirmations = 0;
  if(transaction.height >= 0) {
    confirmations = this.node.services.bitcoind.height - transaction.height + 1;
  }
```
so I am thinking of bypassing it all together and go for a hacky solution where I will get the data from the daemon directly using sth like stdrpc and display it in the html page

[24-May-19 02:27 PM] gcharang#6833
eventhough the output here: https://kmdexplorer.io/insight-api-komodo/tx/5b905da385d3100f5a8419266d5943f703b334dad05022157bef59a52020d002
looks like a daemon constructed txn, its completely made inside insight-api using bitcore-lib-komodo

[24-May-19 02:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
I have seen ( genie sees it right away and pings me )  negative confirmations which suggests the confirmation code is not using data from the daemon itself...

[24-May-19 02:45 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah, this is what they use:
```js
var confirmations = 0;
  if(transaction.height >= 0) {
    confirmations = this.node.services.bitcoind.height - transaction.height + 1;
  }
```

[24-May-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, that code doesn't do much error checking, does it

[24-May-19 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326

[24-May-19 04:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
listunspent disagrees with getwalletinfo, even after a reindex

[24-May-19 04:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
this happened after i took an old Hush v2 wallet.dat and used it on our new chain with `-zapwallettxes`

[24-May-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
well a wallet from a different chain... not so surprise that wallet info is different

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i guess it's not intended to use this wallet, only sweep it

but things seemed to work so I kind of forgot

[24-May-19 04:50 PM] dukeleto#7326

the RPCs which aggregate seem to be correct, I spent almost all utxos

but listunspent is very confused

[24-May-19 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
it makes it confusing, to try to send out the final dust from this wallet

[24-May-19 04:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
but at least it's not a GUI wallet bug, i guess

[24-May-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
I need to add further docs to that warn people to only sweep with an old wallet, and send it all to a new address in a new wallet

I've got the dPoW confs to display on insight exlorer, you can see the progression of a txn's state as blocks get added and notarizations happen from the images above 
right now:
```
daemon - explorer
confirmation - notary confirmation
rawconfirmation - confirmation
```
eventhough this system the daemon uses to convey the info is understandable by devs, to normal people it would be too confusing

So, the above thing is a proof of concept, I will be tweaking it to have only one conf tab. Its behaviour:
red - unconfirmed
orange with number of confs- confirmed but not dpowed
green with number of confs - dpowed
this should be clear to everyone

[25-May-19 10:37 AM] gcharang#6833
also I have bypassed their calculation of confs to take it directly from the daemon's output of getrawtransaction
@dukeleto

@gcharang awesome work, great for the whole ecosystem üëç

[27-May-19 03:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
This may seem like a silly question but I honestly dont know the answer.
What if somebody tried to start an assetchain with the same name but different parameters as another assetchain already in existence?

[27-May-19 03:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka i went down that rabbit hole a bit üòÖ

[27-May-19 03:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
With Hush?

[27-May-19 03:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka unless name + ac_supply are exactly the same, there will be different "magic" numbers and essentially they are different coins with the same name

[27-May-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka yeah, i tried to use HUSH as the AC name of HUSH v3

[27-May-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
but iguana knows Hush to be something very different

[27-May-19 03:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I was advised to use HUSH3

[27-May-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka it really only matters if both coins want to be dpowed with exactly the same asset name, then one basically needs to choose a new name

[27-May-19 03:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
if they don't want dpow, iguana doesn't know about it and it doesn't matter much. Until exchanges....

[27-May-19 03:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah awesome, thanks! 
Is there an updated, reliable, rpc or list somewhere for all the dpow'd coins?

[27-May-19 05:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, are notarisation costs pay per notarisation?

`As the notarizations are transactions, they naturally have a cost, and this cost is covered by you, the asset-chain developer.`
This indiciates that it most likely is, but isn't unambiguous
