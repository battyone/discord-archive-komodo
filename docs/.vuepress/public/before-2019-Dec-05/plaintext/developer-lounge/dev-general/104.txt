put them in same directory then do `python3 conv.py` and it'll prompt you for pubkey

[17-Jan-19 07:36 AM] Alright#0419
then print address

@gcharang

[17-Jan-19 07:41 AM] gcharang#6833
Thanks its working @Alright

[17-Jan-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@gcharang  you can also use the `setpubkey` RPC

[17-Jan-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I made it return the Raddress for the pool amoungst other things

[17-Jan-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can only set it once though, so might not be perfect for your case.

[17-Jan-19 07:51 AM] gcharang#6833
Yeah. alright's script is easier. I have many pubkeys and need the addresses.

@ca333 @dukeleto @blackjok3r @jl777c 
Am I correct that the "account" feature in Bitcoin -> Zcash -> Komodo is going to be obsolete eventually? Don't remember where I came across this. Just want to confirm.
I want to know if I should code the APIs support like these in my kmdgo package:
```getaccount "KMD_address"
getaccountaddress "account"
getaddressesbyaccount "account"```

[18-Jan-19 12:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mylo do you have any knowledge about it ?

[18-Jan-19 12:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ü§î anyway may be I'll just code i....

[18-Jan-19 12:38 AM] Mylo#8306
replaced with 'label' api https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.17.0#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet

yeah code it imo, it'll be around for a little while in kmd probably üò¨

[18-Jan-19 12:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```satinders-MacBook-Pro:~ satinder$ komodo-cli help getaccount
getaccount "KMD_address"

DEPRECATED. Returns the account associated with the given address.```

[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, leaving this command then

[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] Mylo#8306
hey @grewalsatinder what is crypto conditions dot info url?

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cryptoconditions.info

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] Mylo#8306
think redirect is not currently working, but i might be entering wrong addy

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh the forwarding url

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was forwarding to the old slate docs website

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that no more?

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] Mylo#8306
no idea, i thought it was going to github repo

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, let me check, I'll fix it

[18-Jan-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you give me the new URL ?

[18-Jan-19 12:44 AM] Mylo#8306
i don't know the url sorry.   i thought it was just going to jl's cc guide he wrote up

[18-Jan-19 12:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
according to that bitcoin link I was expecting we'll have the `label` API commands in our forks too ü§î 
couldn't find those commands.

? https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/index-book-jl.html

[18-Jan-19 12:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, it was supposed to forward to this url

[18-Jan-19 12:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct

[18-Jan-19 12:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jl777c I see that for signedmessage API I need to unlock my wallet. but for calls like getbalance, getnewaddress etc like I don't need to unlock my wallet with passphrase ü§î

[18-Jan-19 01:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that how it is suppose to be?

[18-Jan-19 05:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
I would love to get rid of "accounts", but i guess it potentially not make some wallets work?

[18-Jan-19 05:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think "accounts" should be removed from RPC interface, just leave the internals, like a dingleberry

[18-Jan-19 05:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
there are a lot of RPCs dealing with accounts that, in theory, need to learn about dpowconfs

[18-Jan-19 05:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
i would rather delete the RPCs

[18-Jan-19 05:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
but also, don't want to be like Bitcoin Core deleting `getinfo` like a madman

[18-Jan-19 05:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
the accounts feature was written for a very early BTC exchange, the story goes. They wanted to manage all user funds directly in their wallet. It never worked out for them, they ended up not using it, and it's been in BTC core ever since, rotting

[18-Jan-19 07:27 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for background apparent story.  tales from the crypt üòÉ

[18-Jan-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
accounts are deprecated

[18-Jan-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
dont use them

[18-Jan-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
all places that have account just use ""

[18-Jan-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC partially deprecated it, zcash deprecated more. I never use them. assume they dont work at all

[18-Jan-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder getbalance doesnt need a privkey to calculate it

[18-Jan-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is interesting getnewaddress doesnt, but that is because it doesnt have to decrypt anything. it makes a new privkey and then adds it to the wallet is my guess

[18-Jan-19 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, just wanted ask and make sure of things. thanks for clearing.
I guess, still we should check if some API which suppose to prompt walletpassphrase message if somehow is not asking.... if that's that case, then it needs fixing to ask.

[18-Jan-19 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto hey mate, can your tests assure of that thing?

[18-Jan-19 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c 
```$ komodo-cli help sendfrom
sendfrom "fromaccount" "toKMDaddress" amount ( minconf "comment" "comment-to" )

DEPRECATED (use sendtoaddress). Sent an amount from an account to a KMD address.```

[18-Jan-19 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought it's not depricated....

[18-Jan-19 10:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is it?

[18-Jan-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
accounts are deprecated
dont use them
all places that have account just use ""

[18-Jan-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe sometimes "*" can be used

[18-Jan-19 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[18-Jan-19 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

If I could keep this speed, may be I'll be done with adding all basic APIs by end of weekend.

[18-Jan-19 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
@grewalsatinder i see that the code doesn't do any validation of RPC arguments a user enters. for example, i need to use privkeys when signing a multisig transaction, and before my rust code does the actual request, it would first check if the data is actually a privkey. are you planning on doing that too?

[18-Jan-19 01:08 PM] jorian#4555
or do you want to keep the layer as thin as possible

[18-Jan-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I plan to add extra custom features of making creating address wif and all such conversions later to this lib

[18-Jan-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then I'll add all those validation checks for the address pubkeys and whatever is required

[18-Jan-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now I'm only adding the CURL API work to it.

[18-Jan-19 01:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the validation and error etc are all reflected from the API itself, so just giving back those same errors in return to API

[18-Jan-19 01:13 PM] jorian#4555
great stuff

[18-Jan-19 01:13 PM] jorian#4555
you really picked up the pace

[18-Jan-19 01:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I embarrassingly spent N months stuck on something so fundamental, which got cleared in first week of this year.

[18-Jan-19 01:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I'm kinda making progress the same way I used to make with node.js code in my early days üôÇ

is learning go hard?

[18-Jan-19 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is indeed different than anything I have ever learned.

[18-Jan-19 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have my fundamentals of programming all set from C/C++ right from the days of I learned computer fundamentals over decade ago

[18-Jan-19 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
PHP, HTML, CSS, Js, were super easy

[18-Jan-19 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
node.js felt a little odd, but still easy

[18-Jan-19 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Golang is just very very odd

[18-Jan-19 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is basically making almost everything a `type`

[18-Jan-19 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
all those OOPs concepts are managed by `type` and `go` routines

[18-Jan-19 01:17 PM] jorian#4555
rust is married to types too

[18-Jan-19 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I yet to apply all the fundamentals I learned to my next work that I'll do in proof of concept apps.

[18-Jan-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so far work is very basic thing, but it's just doing what it needs to do. call API, get answer, manage error handling and use methods to easily work with go and kmd API

[18-Jan-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's all

[18-Jan-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Apps will need to be concurrent, so will have more go language things used in them.

[18-Jan-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll get to learn making custom transactions through this kmdgo package üôÇ

[18-Jan-19 01:20 PM] jorian#4555
