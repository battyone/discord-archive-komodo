@D.rabbani 100% POS will allow POW until block 100

[07-Feb-19 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
sounds like you aren't staking

[07-Feb-19 06:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright  i forgot to do set generate true 0 and treu 1

[07-Feb-19 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
true 0 on the node that i have dsitributed coins to

[07-Feb-19 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and true 1 on the other node

[07-Feb-19 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and its working fine

[07-Feb-19 06:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
the balance is all on node with true 0

Hello all, question about asset chain creations...
is it possible to use -ac_eras  and -ac_staked together to change the PoW/PoS %?
so something on the line of 1st era to have 80% PoW and 20% PoS
then 2nd era to have 60% PoW and 40% PoS 
and so on with each era.....

[07-Feb-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
eras doesnt work on that

[07-Feb-19 01:43 PM] dude#6062
i didn't think so, had to ask tho... thank you

[07-Feb-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible to do, but someone would have to do it

[07-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dude#6062
what do you mean?

[07-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing that prevents eras functionality from applying to every possible -ac parameter

[07-Feb-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
other than it being an incredibly large amount of work for something that maybe is not so much in demand

[07-Feb-19 01:45 PM] dude#6062
gotcha

[07-Feb-19 01:46 PM] dude#6062
thanks, it was just a thought, but agree not sure demand is there....

[07-Feb-19 01:47 PM] dude#6062
btw thanks for your work on KMD, excellent platform!

[07-Feb-19 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
changing pow/pos % at certain heights will make your difficulty do really weird things. When coins change their pow algo's, they are very careful to make sure their difficulty changes over smoothly instead of making drastic changes. Just another thought. But if you really want to do it, fork KMD and write the C++ üòÉ

[07-Feb-19 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
actctaully it would do very much at all.. with PoS64 at least

[07-Feb-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We looked at something like this for labs but decided against it

[07-Feb-19 10:50 PM] CryptoMedication#4824
Hey team. I'm doing an in-depth write up on Komodo, and I have several questions about the technicals of the project. Do you all know who the best individual would be to have a fairly in-depth conversation about the project? Thank you in advance.

[07-Feb-19 10:52 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c or @ca333

[07-Feb-19 11:34 PM] ca333#0118
We have many skilled team and community-members that can be helpful @CryptoMedication - often we collaborate on this sort of questions to not express/represent things just from one point of view, etc. 

Do you want to have a call, video-conf, etc. or rather just a set of predefined questions that you want to get answered? If the latter - feel free to post us your questions and we will quickly return them answered.

@jl777c  
Found bug on daemon start where it will try to add wallet transactions to mempool and they will fail ContextualCheckTransaction as expired. 
And then it deletes them from the wallet. It seeems to happen before IsInitialBlockDownload() latches toi false, so the fix is:
```void CWallet::ReacceptWalletTransactions()
{
    if ( IsInitialBlockDownload() )
        return;```

[08-Feb-19 12:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cant exactly test fix too eaily but I dont see it causing any harm at all.

[08-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt that make it so it wont process them at all?

[08-Feb-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i see, it prevents deleting from the wallet. probably a good idea

[08-Feb-19 04:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah it just stops real tx being deleted from wallet

[08-Feb-19 04:59 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hi guys i just want to know that on my first node the balance is 3 billion approx on second its 2 million i want to stake it with 2 million only  100% POS

[08-Feb-19 04:59 PM] D.rabbani#9094
like after generating the supply i have transfered 2 million on seocond node

[08-Feb-19 05:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
now i just want to stake with that 2 million with all the reward i did -pubkey

[08-Feb-19 05:00 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but the reward is still distributed between the first and second node

[08-Feb-19 05:06 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@blackjok3r

[08-Feb-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181

I was having issues compiling komodod from `jl777` branch on osx. cclib was first issue. solved it with this:

[09-Feb-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```
brew install boost
brew install libsodium
brew install berkeley-db4

cd src/cc/rogue
CC=gcc-6 ./configure
make

#changed cc/rogue/Makefile
CC=gcc-6



# changes in src/cc/Makefile

CC = gcc-6
CC_DARWIN = g++-6


# changes in makecclib
gcc-6 -std=c++11 -I../univalue/include -I../cryptoconditions/include -I../cryptoconditions/src -I../cryptoconditions/src/asn -I.. -I. -fPIC -shared -c -o ../libcc.so cclib.cpp -L/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.68.0_1/lib -I/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.68.0_1/include -L/usr/local/Cellar/libsodium/1.0.17/lib -I/usr/local/Cellar/libsodium/1.0.17/include -L/usr/local/opt/berkeley-db@4/lib -I/usr/local/opt/berkeley-db@4/include

CC @SHossain

[09-Feb-19 08:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder are you able to simply set `CC=gcc-6` in your shell ? and why CC vs CC_DARWIN using diff compilers?

[09-Feb-19 08:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes as shell command

[09-Feb-19 08:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
setting CC in your bash shell should work, if not, that is a bug in the build system, imho

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
you shouldn't have to set and change it multiple places/times

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
For darwin I did not try

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
CC=gcc-6 ./configure; make

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
i believe i have done stuff like that, but not with this new rogue/cc code

[09-Feb-19 08:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
True, it's just the steps I took to resolve my issue

[09-Feb-19 08:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Must be flexible I guess

[09-Feb-19 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
$(CC) should be inherited from the environment, is all I am saying. I don't *think* you need to modify Makefiles, and if you do, I feel that is a bug

[09-Feb-19 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

gonna try this

[09-Feb-19 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright  can yo please tell me that how do i stop staking from 1 billion because i have used POS staker but its still staking from 1 billion

[09-Feb-19 02:36 PM] D.rabbani#9094
?

[09-Feb-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
what?

[09-Feb-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
no idea what you mean

[09-Feb-19 02:40 PM] SHossain#0007
send the amount you don't want to stake to a different address in different computer or paper wallet which is not staking

[09-Feb-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
@D.rabbani I made a script for starting POS chains if you want to try it

[09-Feb-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
should "just work"

[09-Feb-19 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker

follow the readme for the dependencies
start a brand new chain, just connect two nodes and don't mine any blocks
run `./TUIstaker.py`, on the first menu add your new chain then select it

then select `Start a new chain` from the menu

[09-Feb-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
that's not going to work with an ac_eras chain as the coinbase maturity is 100 blocks

[09-Feb-19 03:06 PM] Alright#0419
you can just use the RNDsendmany option after block 100 if you're using ac_eras

[09-Feb-19 04:41 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai With RNDsendmany

[09-Feb-19 04:42 PM] D.rabbani#9094
when i do like 10 utxos and percentage variance 4

[09-Feb-19 04:42 PM] D.rabbani#9094
nothing happens

[09-Feb-19 04:42 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i mean

[09-Feb-19 04:42 PM] D.rabbani#9094
it doesnt stop staking from the large amount

[09-Feb-19 04:43 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but anyways thanks @Alright  üòÉ

[09-Feb-19 04:43 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i try my best observing different opinions

[09-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
send the coins you don't want to stake elsewhere

[09-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
then do RNDsendmany again

[09-Feb-19 05:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@Alright  can i send some coins from immature balance to mature balance if i can then it will solve my problem

[09-Feb-19 05:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i dont know how to do that

[09-Feb-19 05:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
currently my node is staking from 0.001 baance thats mature

[09-Feb-19 05:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and 10 billion is in immature

[09-Feb-19 05:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i want to send 2 million atleast to mature for staking

[09-Feb-19 05:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and it will defo solve my problem

[09-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Alright#0419
I need some perspective on what it is you're doing

[09-Feb-19 05:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its like the premine 10 billion and then i did  till 60 billion like 6 blocks of 10 billion as a reward

[09-Feb-19 05:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
after that 0.001 will be block reward

[09-Feb-19 05:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
until it reaches 65 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:10 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thats it

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so currently i have 60 billion in my immature balance i know i cannot stake from it

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Alright#0419
have you considered dividing by 10? üòõ

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
haha dividing by 10 üòÑ

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Alright#0419
why 65 billion

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
its just testing purpose

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
not my requirement my supervisor said so

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
given me a task

[09-Feb-19 05:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
to complete

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i am trying different tactics to make the chain work

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Alright#0419
ok so what is the problem?

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i know

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
the problem

[09-Feb-19 05:12 PM] D.rabbani#9094
