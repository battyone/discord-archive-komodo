PoS chains are corrupting wallet.dats ... rescan on every daemon start üò¶

[01-Dec-18 02:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
sounds no bueno

[01-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
Will test it out

[01-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r latest dev?

[01-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
every single daemon start? nothing in particular triggers it?

[01-Dec-18 03:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its been happening for weeks

[01-Dec-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all my CFEK chains

[01-Dec-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Dec-18 03:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
on every start it force rescans

[01-Dec-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this triggers a rescan

[01-Dec-18 03:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does it on every single daemon start for me

[01-Dec-18 03:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Alright

[01-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Alright#0419
just got chain up on jl777 dev

[01-Dec-18 03:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181

no

[01-Dec-18 03:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it happens when you have heaps of utxo and stake

[01-Dec-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I should -zapwalelttxs on one og them and see if it fixes it

[01-Dec-18 03:17 AM] Alright#0419
what is heaps

[01-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
5000+

[01-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at least thats what I have on these

[01-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its always happened

[01-Dec-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wait a sec... debug.log has something

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so maybe it's that wallet in particular?

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its always happened

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
even back on POSTESTs

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, I've seen it, but it wasn't forcing rescan

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
always ignored it lol

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
from what I can tell it's entirely benign

[01-Dec-18 03:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same.... but its not good.... its complaining of a miss9ng vin

[01-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
yes, trying to figure that out

[01-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
don't think it's staking related

[01-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
was getting it while testing oracles

[01-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
but txes eventually went through

[01-Dec-18 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
I thought it was mempool cc spending causing it

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does it happen with le latest change to the mempool fix a day or so ago?

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There was a pretty bad bug in that

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
just noticed it

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
using jl777 dev

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be in that branch yes

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
so then yes

[01-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
should I try a build prior to that PR?

[01-Dec-18 03:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181

I have just ran zapwallettxs on that and restarted it

[01-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
Ah that is not what I am seeing

[01-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
unrelated I'm guessing

[01-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
I'm trying to figure out if what I'm experiencing with oracles is benign or not

[01-Dec-18 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
seems to be so far

[01-Dec-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess I should remove wallet.dat and then import priv key and see what it does ?

[01-Dec-18 03:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this wil be a big issue on longer chains

[01-Dec-18 03:24 AM] Alright#0419
try dumpwallet importwallet?

[01-Dec-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
btw is is "normal" when chains sync... that the upload bandwidth is 5x more than download ? jl just pushed a fix that sped up sync (before it was horribly slow)

[01-Dec-18 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but Im limited by upload bandwidth ... seems really odd

[01-Dec-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@blackjok3r you have a cc activated ac_staked chain running on dev branch atm?

[01-Dec-18 03:38 AM] Alright#0419
cc rpc commands flat out broken?

[01-Dec-18 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Dec-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what do you nede me to check

[01-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Alright#0419
I think it's ac_staked

[01-Dec-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
oh wait ... no thats not staked lol

[01-Dec-18 03:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181

same result

odd

[01-Dec-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
one sec

[01-Dec-18 03:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe addressindex and spentindex are not set

[01-Dec-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there was a fix pushed

[01-Dec-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that maybe is stopping that from activating

[01-Dec-18 03:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try to rsync it with -addressindex and -spentindex

[01-Dec-18 03:46 AM] Alright#0419
Ah I'm an idiot

[01-Dec-18 03:46 AM] Alright#0419

import wallet fixed that problem of missing vin

[01-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now to figure out why its got txs with no vin in the wallet

[01-Dec-18 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Dec-18 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe addtowallet needs to filter txs with empty vin
