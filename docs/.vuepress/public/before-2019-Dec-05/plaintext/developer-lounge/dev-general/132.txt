@D.rabbani depends, what are you paying?

[10-Mar-19 05:21 PM] jorian#4555
the `zc*` komodo-cli RPCs still work. shouldn't we disable those? as they are sprout-only (afaik)

[10-Mar-19 05:23 PM] jorian#4555
or do we still need them for the 2 chains that didn't yet upgrade to sapling?

[10-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Alright#0419
do believe that sprout is deactivated on OOT and ZILLA

[10-Mar-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the CVE gave us little time (or choice), I certainly wish it didnt happen, but it did

[10-Mar-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to ask them

[10-Mar-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
they are nowhere near as bad as blockstream, but that is just my opionion

[11-Mar-19 12:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User from the perspective of other Zcash-derived coins, like HUSH, who were not notified *at all* about CVE stuff, yeah, this transition has not been smooth, to say the least

[11-Mar-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and I was forbidden to tell anybody else, only ca333 and I knew on the KMD side.

[11-Mar-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
and blaming KMD for this is like blaming LTC for what btc legacy guys do, it had to be a passthrough. hey, this is what the zcash company gets $2 mil per month for (about same as ICO amount for KMD to put it in perspective)

@dukeleto  the magic of one working rpc call.
http://116.203.106.19:3002/    it shows stats at the bottom trx / 24 h etc.    
This is a new explorer forked from ravencoin.
I love it it even have a rpc browser interface ( http://116.203.106.19:3002/rpc-browser?method=MoMoMdata ) for all that new stuff.

[11-Mar-19 05:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
it point at BEER at the moment was the fastest to sync

I'm not sure if this is normal or is it just me. I just couldn't get my head around properly with Go concurrency. I read, watch, read another book, online article, try one code, another code bit, 
at this point I'm in just confusing state with sending events update from http.Handler to a websocket via goroutines+channels.

I can code rogue web app, but I am not coding it. want to get my fundamentals clear, as without these fundamentals I'll get stuck ever another step.
Concurrency is like the heart of Go language.

[12-Mar-19 02:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will go through that hint provided by the comment in that question, and see if that clears my understanding

[12-Mar-19 02:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not focusing on making a app for testers or end users, I'm focusing on learning and clearing my Go programming fundamentals, so that I can make some small applications for kmd later

[12-Mar-19 02:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at this point I miss the days of learning programming or some computer science subject with my graduation peers.
we could discuss and help each other, and learn together.
I see there are communities around Go, but may be I came around those who are not as much as helping as JavaScript communities are.

gonna play with that code now

[12-Mar-19 04:11 AM] Mylo#8306
In gorilla chat example, the /ws handler function has a middleman.
Browser connects to /ws
Instead of only w and r for writer and reader, a serveWs has been delegated the mgmt of connection - client.go
When message received by, client.go has a ‚Äúhub‚Äù of all connected clients, the message is broadcast thru hub.
On bcast, sends to all clients in loop.
In html page of clients, on message received appends the received message in home.html

[12-Mar-19 04:15 AM] Mylo#8306
Serve the html from chat instead of cat cat cat or make updateable dom element

[12-Mar-19 04:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
other than this gorilla chat example, I did not find the channel type used as custom type/struct: https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/blob/master/examples/chat/hub.go#L42

using a custom type/struct for a channel

[12-Mar-19 04:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
conceptually, it makes sense, can also understand the code logic flow. 
I'll say I got it, when I'll have my own code doing the same thing.

network communications is fun.  if you haven't solved it by the weekend, i'd like to have a crack.
Reading enough of your example and the gorilla example, the go syntax is less ugly than what i thought of it last week.
