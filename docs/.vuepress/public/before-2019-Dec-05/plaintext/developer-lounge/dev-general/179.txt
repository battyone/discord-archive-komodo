build-mac.sh changed a lot recently

[29-May-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, I think it's fair that some solution is needed to not allow users to get this state:
```configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
 Error 77```

[29-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
and yeah, it sets CC and CXX and various things, i see why it was breaking so hard

[29-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
i set CC but not CXX, gosh

[29-May-19 01:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is a recipe for madness

[29-May-19 01:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL i am trying with gcc-9 set with CC/CXX in build-mac.sh, mostly because i am a masochist

[29-May-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
aaaand same error 77

[29-May-19 01:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
i done messed my compilers up good

[29-May-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i see now that build-mac.sh is not doing the same things as build.sh, it has it's own build infra

[29-May-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
similar to how radix42 got things to build on freebsd

[29-May-19 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
g++-8 seems to compile fine on my side atm, I'm not sure if it supposed to work with gcc-9 tbh üòÉ

[29-May-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I have build-mac.sh without any modifications with gcc-6 in exports but it using gcc-8 during compilation (only one / default installed by brew on this macbook)

[29-May-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
``` brew list
autoconf    binutils    gcc@8        guile        libmpc        openssl        wget
autogen        coreutils    gdb        isl        libtool        pkg-config
automake    flock        gettext        libffi        libunistring    protobuf
bdw-gc        gcc@6        gmp        libidn2        mpfr        readline
```

[29-May-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, actually I have both gcc@6 and gcc@8 hmm

[29-May-19 01:32 PM] TonyL#3577
But build using g++-8 / gcc8
```libtool: compile:  g++-8 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -D__GMP_WITHIN_GMP -I/Users/antonlysakov/latest_FSM/komodo/depends/x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0/include -pipe -O1 -c cxx/dummy.cc -o dummy.o```
and I didn't do any additional manipulations

[29-May-19 01:58 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto
It looks like clue in something different, I have same error as you on latest FSM

[29-May-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
gcc@8 is anyway needed for current compilation but I'm very sorry if confusion from my side ate your time

[29-May-19 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be very recent change so :/

[29-May-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 works?

[29-May-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought they were in sync

[29-May-19 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Trying

[29-May-19 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm thinking now maybe Decker changed something else after I last time tried compilation (or it because of some fresh code which didn't persist in repo from which changes were merged into FSM/jl777), investigating

[29-May-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
the above error is not a linking error

[29-May-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
non-void functions lack a `return`, that should be fixed

[29-May-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
I tried, but that last error about the declaration of `notarisations` is really weird @TonyL . that is the error i pointed out to you originally, @jl777c

[29-May-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think the error line is wrong

[29-May-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's highlighting the wrong line

[29-May-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
because it can't figure out where to show you komodo_connectblock() lacks a return

[29-May-19 02:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's so freaking complex, it took me a while to look at it, and i wasn't sure either

[29-May-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's probably in the last few commits to that function, tho. I was dealing with other compiler issues and never fully debugged the issue

[29-May-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker plz help

[29-May-19 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
jl777 branch build failing with: `ld: library not found for -lidn2` errors so don't think it in sync with FSM (jl777 branch build using gcc6 it seems) https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/gqM4sv6VT5/

[29-May-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 and FSM are in sync

[29-May-19 03:14 PM] TonyL#3577
I was on not correct upstream when tried to build jl777 branch, sorry.. Still wondering what is the secret power to be productive like you 16+ hours per day - just 10+ hours and I'm starting to operate my computer like a dummy üòî

[29-May-19 03:15 PM] TonyL#3577
So jl777 and FSM will generate same errors now (started jl777 branch build to ensure)

[29-May-19 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810

CHIPS is looking for a React Developer who can assist with GUI configuration for the newly create CHIPS Poker GUI.

[01-Jun-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
still has it

[01-Jun-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not happy with it touchpad, since I came from Mac laptops

[01-Jun-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it's wifi chip supports 5GHz, but just don't trust it. Only consider it more compatible with 2GHz

[01-Jun-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
other than that it's good machine

[01-Jun-19 01:11 PM] jorian#4555
hehe, the touchpad was one of the questions i have indeed. Apple makes the perfect touchpad

[01-Jun-19 01:11 PM] jorian#4555
multigesture stuff doesn't work so well then?

[01-Jun-19 01:11 PM] jorian#4555
do you use it daily?

@jl777c there are some interesting things going on here, which could help speed up the sync of KMD and all asset chains. I somewhat doubt Zcash will merge it in, but we may want to grab it when it's working a bit better: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/4037

@dukeleto I don't entirely disagree with that, but like I said I have mixed emotions (mostly due to the concept of trust vs trustless)
