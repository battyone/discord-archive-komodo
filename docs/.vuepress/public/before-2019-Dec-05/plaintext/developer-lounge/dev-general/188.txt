$HUSH is the FIRST Zcash-world coin to remove the need for every single full node to download ~900MB of Sprout params, since we have none of those transactions in our chain!
https://t.co/Mv4Ov6720U
Also dropped a PR to @PirateChain which is in development:

pretty sure Pirate will be second!

[19-Jun-19 08:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
since the entire Hush blockchain is 330MB currently, not downloading a 900MB file we don't need is quite strategic!

[20-Jun-19 02:40 AM] Mylo#8306
@dukeleto when you build the hush daemon is built, how will pirate chain be able to build komodo without downloading the sprout keys.   is there a build switch for building the komodo daemon for this?  (hope that makes sense)

[20-Jun-19 02:40 AM] Mylo#8306
pardon the grammar, just had first sip of ☕

[20-Jun-19 04:29 AM] gcharang#6833
I think for running the KMD chain, the daemon does need sprout params as the KMD chain has sprout transactions on it
but for new assetchains created that have only sapling Z-txns, this will be useful

[20-Jun-19 11:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo Hush can build + sync without sprout params, because we have no sprout transactions in our chain

[20-Jun-19 11:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate can build and sync 32 blocks until it coredumps on the first JoinSplit, currently. But it's reasonable to relax some requirements about validating very old Sprout transactions, so Pirate should be able to do this, with a tiny bit more work than Hush

[20-Jun-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang i think the same trick that will work for Pirate will work with KMD, which does have sprout zaddr xtns in it's history

[20-Jun-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
If a new AC has no sprout xtns on it, it can do exactly the same as Hush and avoid the dumb 900MB sprout files

[20-Jun-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
I synced a HUSH full node last night, from scratch, without ever having any Zcash param files on the computer, via the SilentDragon GUI. It downloaded all params needed (not sprout!!!) and did the diddly

[20-Jun-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@dukeleto can the KMD daemon validate the sprout transactions without the sprout params?

[20-Jun-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
No, but also, validating old transactions that are behind checkpoints and DPoW isn't really providing a lot of security

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Jun-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@gcharang my idea is to make the daemon not download the sprout files, but if they are present, use them. This will allow dev/etc to do sproutly things if they need

[20-Jun-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is a KMD/Pirate optimization

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
since Pirate needs to process sprout claims/etc in the future

[20-Jun-19 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
"If we see a sprout xtn, only validate if we have sprout params on disk", something like that

[20-Jun-19 11:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
and downloading sprout 900MB files become a manual thing, average nodes don't do

[20-Jun-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
understood

[20-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks mate.  i'm tired.  i'll observe this new stream lined d/l stuff.  nice to remove sprout stuff.

@dukeleto @ebfull I've already done this in my reference wallet code branch. There isn't a PR yet because the change depends on earlier changes that are still being reviewed. Am away from my laptop, but I'll add a link to your issue when I'm back.

Hey guys, Can you do some release notes and overall better komodo releases?
Like this https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/dev-multios-0.4.0a-alpha is pretty confusing. We (outside developers) are confused. Is it a stable release, ready for production, or still pre release, what are the changes, is it a fork, when is the fork activation etc...

[21-Jun-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
fork activates july 15th

[21-Jun-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
changes are mostly in the various CC modules, it is basically the annual update

[21-Jun-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how many commits or lines of code, it would be good for someone to indeed go through all the commits and list out the highlights

[21-Jun-19 03:27 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Great, Thank you... Good to hear that we have a release month before activation 😃

[21-Jun-19 03:28 PM] TheTrunk#1040
as some coins give just a few days/week.

[21-Jun-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this was to give us time to make sure everything is smooth and still have time in case anything was not quite right. so far we only found some transient issues with a couple of the smaller assetchains.

[21-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
also, to my knowledge, for KMD itself it isnt actually hardforking as no consensus rules other than season 3 notaries changed

[21-Jun-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
however, if you run with season2 notaries, then your node is basically running without dPoW. it is a graceful degradation, still should work though not secured from 51% attack

please ask any specific questions, now i think about it, i think there were 100,000+ commits

vast majority isolated to specific CC, which wont be active unless those are in use

[21-Jun-19 03:33 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Also wanted to ask if there is some technical documentation on how to implement/ how exactly the over time 5% appreciation works - I mean how to implement reward claiming. I just know that I should basically look at every utxo for a given address, what locktime is there and calculate the amount it can claim and then try to send this new utxo with updated amount to my address. If there is some formula written for the amount, that would be helpful

[21-Jun-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's easier

[21-Jun-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
@lukechilds made a repo with exactly that

[21-Jun-19 03:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TheTrunk just send all funds from an address to itself, with enough for a transaction fee

[21-Jun-19 03:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
that will claim interest via "negative fee"

you will see a fee which is negative on block explorer

[21-Jun-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are running the daemon, just add up the "interest" fields for all the vins

[21-Jun-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is the extra spending that the tx can do

[21-Jun-19 03:35 PM] jl777c#5810
to calculate the value of the "interest" field, that get-komodo-rewards repo has all the gory details

[21-Jun-19 03:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
very cool, i didn't know about that repo above

[21-Jun-19 03:36 PM] TheTrunk#1040
@dukeleto So supposing I have 1 utxo that originally has 100KMD and I just send 99.99KMD to the same address and 0.01 for fee, my address will actually receive lets say 101KMD? Like that simple?

[21-Jun-19 03:36 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Thank you for the repo, going through it 😃

[21-Jun-19 03:36 PM] TheTrunk#1040
oh thats nice simple repo

[21-Jun-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TheTrunk basically, yes. Your receiving address will end up with more funds via a negative fee

[21-Jun-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
let's say you had 5KMD interest on 100 KMD

[21-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
you would end up with 104.9999 KMD in the addr

[21-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
`fee - interest` becomes the actual "fee" once interest is taken into account

[21-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
which is how it becomes negative

[21-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
only utxos >= 10 KMD earn rewards and there are a few other rules

[21-Jun-19 03:45 PM] dukeleto#7326

@jl777c i noticed that agama used to use a double fee (0.0002) for reward claiming, was that to ensure it gets into the next block, for rewards claims that were large in KB size?

[21-Jun-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about agama fees

[21-Jun-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
It used 0.0002 as a fee for rewards

[21-Jun-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a gift to miners?

[21-Jun-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
Not sure, but I wondered if it was to reduce the time somebody's entire balance is unconfirmed

[21-Jun-19 03:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes reward claiming could be large xtns that maybe some miners would not include in a block

[21-Jun-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
that could be, but we dont have a feemarket yet

[21-Jun-19 03:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
not officially 😅

[21-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, true, not a fee market but big tx could easily go over the 0.0001 fee

[21-Jun-19 03:59 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Just an idea - would be good if insight explorer utxo api endpoint would return locktime of it too 😄

[21-Jun-19 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX is that something that is viable or available from the API at all? ^^^

[21-Jun-19 04:09 PM] TheTrunk#1040
It is available from the api, but you need to get the list of utxos and then for each of the transaction get the transactions information. So assuming 50 utxos it means 51 calls instead of just 1

New Zcash source code fork @ArrowCrypto will only have shielded transactions + mine a genesis block, just like @PirateChain . 
Equihash 144,5 PoW, 45s blocktime, 210M $ARW supply.
Maybe they will add DPoW to protect against FPGA dominance and 51% attacks!

Bull markets mean new Zcash forks, at least this one is a "Fork With A Point" (from their whitepaper)

[21-Jun-19 10:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
which I think is a "jab" at Ycash, having no point
