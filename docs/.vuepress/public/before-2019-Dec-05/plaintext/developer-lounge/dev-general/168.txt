FYI Beam is centrally governed by a foundation, not sure if that was mentioned in our comparison.

yeah i tried KMDICE about 20 times in the last week, about 3 or 4 failed at 19619

@dukeleto interesting curl | bash thing.   i'll give instructions to curl ; bash i guess then.

[23-Apr-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo  it's always safer to download a script, read it, then run it

[23-Apr-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
`curl | bash ` looks cool, but is very insecure

noted my man.  will fix in all my copy

[23-Apr-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is an unpopular opinion, but you will be more secure and recommending others to be more secure

[23-Apr-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
that blog post I linked to is the best example of why it's a bad idea

[23-Apr-19 11:07 AM] Mylo#8306
yes exactly.   this is not the most secure thing to be advising.  it is a cool one liner, but ...i guess like in the real world, one liners aren't so great.

My containers infrastracture working similar way - from container I'm using only envinroment, then needed binaries downloading by wget and all setup/start doing by script

Hi everyone, i am new to komodo and i am trying to understand all the functionalities. If I want to create an AssetChain with parameter ac_staked=100 , how can I choose which nodes can stake ? I mean can i configure my chain as a dPOS ?

[24-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
100% PoS chain is staked by the coins that exist

[24-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
distribute coins to the nodes you want to allow to stake

[24-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very important to have good coin distribution for a 100% PoS chain

[24-Apr-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we have NOTHING to do with dPoS

[24-Apr-19 09:33 AM] Marabou#8038
Ok thanks @jl777c , i also don't like dPOS but i'm forced to use it for my work project . But if I want users executing transactions of my coin in my chain but only some nodes are validating ? I mean can I allow only some nodes to validate ?

[24-Apr-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
all full nodes validate all transactions and blocks

[24-Apr-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you could setup SPV servers

[24-Apr-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
then the lite clients wont be validating all the transactions

[24-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Marabou#8038
Ok thank you for the informations. Also i thank you for your work with komodo which is always innovating and not trying to overhype

The PR actually has some of the nicest ZEC tests I have seen, but still not good enough for ZEC

Our IVKs may be in a different format/etc, and that is fine

[24-Apr-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC has some reasonable concerns, I just don't think it's worth not having anything to play with

[24-Apr-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
Current IVKs have the "issue" where you MUST keep track of the zaddr they correspond to, externally

[24-Apr-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not in the viewkey

[24-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
what is the I in IVK?

[24-Apr-19 12:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
so if you lose that

[24-Apr-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
INCOMING VIEW KEY

[24-Apr-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
"read-only" view key, you can only see incoming xtns, not outgoing

AS for Arrr around the cornerüôÉ

[24-Apr-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you lose the corresponding zaddr of a IVK, you must brute force search all of chain history, just like z_importkey

[24-Apr-19 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's ... less than ideal, but hey, still better than nothing

[24-Apr-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC wants to embed some data into the viewkey to make it faster to find the zaddr associated with it, but they don't have any good solutions

[24-Apr-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
or don't care

[24-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
the thing radix added, this is meant to be IVK only?

although maybe I'm mistaken

[24-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you, a KMD developer have 1000 viewkeys laying around, good luck knowing which chain and which network on that chain they go to

[24-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is why I think embedding asset chain name into the base58 prefix would be a good KMD addition

[24-Apr-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
you need to know z address along with viewing key

[24-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
