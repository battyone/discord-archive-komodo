[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
thank you so much for the help

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
we were actuallly puzzled

[30-Oct-18 11:51 AM] D.rabbani#9094
but you made us relief

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
actually we only got two pcs for testing at the moment

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
one is mine and another is my partners

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so we are trying to implement something on it üòÑ

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i will set generate true  0

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and will set generate true 1 on another node

[30-Oct-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
after 100 blocks

[30-Oct-18 11:53 AM] D.rabbani#9094
because we only got two nodes

[30-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
no

[30-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
you *might* need a node that has `setgenerate true 1` before block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
you definitely need a node staking by block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
that is my node

[30-Oct-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
i have node staking

[30-Oct-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
mate

[30-Oct-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
and the other one is my partners node

[30-Oct-18 11:54 AM] D.rabbani#9094
so i wil set generate true 1 before block 100

[30-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
need to set it immediately to mine block 1

[30-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
wait for it to mine 2 blocks

[30-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
do `setgenerate false`

[30-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Alright#0419
follow to guide for the possplitter

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
do `setgenerate true 1` on a *different* node

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
then do `setgenerate true 0` on the node you used possplitter on

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Alright#0419
then just leave it

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
okai thanks @Alright

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
ill do that and will let you know the outcome

[30-Oct-18 11:56 AM] D.rabbani#9094
for sure

[30-Oct-18 12:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
also just one last question -ac_end effective on anything?

[30-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it ends block subsidy

[30-Oct-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
if we dont want to use possplitter method ? is there any alternative?

[30-Oct-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
for that

[30-Oct-18 12:16 PM] D.rabbani#9094
liek we dont want balance to be distributed to 64 addresses?

[30-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont have to, it will just take a bit of time for blocks to be steady

[30-Oct-18 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case for a 100% PoS coin, the initial distribution is CRITICAL

[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so distributing the stake to 64+ people will allow the staking

[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the chain still works if all funds are concentrated into a few addresses, but that is really not a recommended state for a 100% PoS chain

[30-Oct-18 12:21 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thanks mr jl777c really appreciated  for your help and i  also want to appologize for asking so many questions as i am eager to learn the block chain üòÉ but applaud that i am getting it pretty fast

[30-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
always happy to help onboard new devs

[30-Oct-18 01:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
hi getting errors of invalid block mined what is the reason behind this

[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] SHossain#0007
block from another node got accepted in the network. hence, this block is invalid. if on 100% staked chain, after the first ~100 blocks, normal mining will show invalid block

[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as things are in sync and it is mining, you can ignore such errors

[30-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
you will get that on every chain regardless of POS %

[30-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
ignore it

[30-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
it's your node creating the invalid block btw @SHossain

[30-Oct-18 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
which chain?

[30-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[30-Oct-18 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
CCNG?

[30-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
any chain

[30-Oct-18 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
I just mean when you see that error

[30-Oct-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
it's your node mining an invalid block

[30-Oct-18 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...yes. that is correct

[30-Oct-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
not someone else's

[30-Oct-18 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
someone elese mined a valid block and submitted, i mined the invalid

[30-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't have to do with someone else mining a block

[30-Oct-18 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. got you

[30-Oct-18 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks for clearing me up

[30-Oct-18 01:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dukeleto 

Can you please post the return without the grep? I need to see how it fits into the structure of the response.

[30-Oct-18 02:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can you please tell me where to post the screenshot

[30-Oct-18 02:23 PM] D.rabbani#9094

@dukeleto 
I see there's also a property called `pruned` that wasn't in our documentation earlier. Did someone add this recently?

[30-Oct-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus i blame jl777

[30-Oct-18 03:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus it came in via upstream merging

[30-Oct-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
lots of little changes like that will come with this Sapling merge, fyi. Like, a lot üòâ

[30-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ooh boy

[30-Oct-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus that tells you if you are in pruning mode or not, which means not all xtns/blocks are kept, only some

[30-Oct-18 03:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
to save disk space

[30-Oct-18 03:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, one sec

[30-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, I got all of that. Thank you.

@Bryan_Beus your work on docs is *relentless* and *necessary* and makes KMD look really awesome to newcomers, while also very useful to old timers. Thanks again, they look shiny

[30-Oct-18 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
shiny docs to a newcomer, there is almost nothing better to pull them in

[30-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
üòÉ 

Glad I can be useful. I would like to get some coding in at some point.

[30-Oct-18 03:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This stuff is so exciting, I just want to use it!

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Bryan_Beus one of my algorithms is to look at bugs + new features in BTC + ZEC, and see if they exist or can be easily applied to KMD

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Mylo and I are talking about doing some tutorials, so I think that will be a good chance to get in on some of the action.

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
somebody asked for `size_on_disk` for Zcash on Github, so I implemented it for KMD, Hush + Zcash in the same night üòÉ

[30-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nice

[30-Oct-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
the PR I sent to Zcash will sit for weeks, while James usually merges things within minutes or hours. That is something that I really love about KMD

you're a real treasure for our ecosystem.

[30-Oct-18 03:54 PM] dukeleto#7326
contributions feel very welcome, they don't sit on Github forever

[30-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, James is a great tech leader.

[30-Oct-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
I saw this PR on Github, and that is why KMD has `size_on_disk`: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3630

get chain size through rpc ¬∑ Issue #3630 ¬∑ zcash/zcash
Is it possible to get chain size on disk through rpc? The equivalent of bitcoind size_on_disk property from the getblockchaininfo rpc method.

[30-Oct-18 03:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
granted, it was also easy to merge in. Sometimes a tiny tiny BTC feature requires changing 99 internals things, and it's not worth it. This was super easy

[30-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nice

[30-Oct-18 07:45 PM] TK#2921
Hi, I don't know if its the good channel but I've a question about dPOW. I understand that every ten minutes, the komodo blockchain is written on the bitcoin blockchain by the notary nodes so if you want to make a 51% attack, you need to overpower bitcoin. So here are my questions.
1. How (I mean technically) are the komodo blockchain written in the bitcoin blockchain?
2. How the bitcoin is queried by the komodo nodes to verify their chains? Must they run a bitcoin node alongside the komodo one?
3. How the proof in the bitcoin blockchain is known by the komodo nodes?
Thanks in advance for any answer.

[30-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
1. with a notarization tx like: 773e6ee5705023bc1b37ffa4c6fbcfc85d21412ad3ab50e0454e7e281c4952b6

[30-Oct-18 07:54 PM] jl777c#5810
2. only the notary nodes need to run BTC to validate the notarizations, then write the validated data to the komodochain

[30-Oct-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
3. all the nodes look for the validated notarizations and update state

[30-Oct-18 08:13 PM] TK#2921
Thanks.  But what prevent me to make my own notarization, write them on the BTC chain, and do a classical 51% attack? As the nodes validates their komodochain using the validated notarization written in the komodochain, if I make my own notarization and include them in a forked komodochain, how will the attacked nodes react?

[30-Oct-18 08:13 PM] TK#2921
By the way, is there any notarization tx example?

[30-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant make a valid notarization tx

[30-Oct-18 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
invalid notarizations are rejected

[30-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
even if you could create a notarization tx, it would need to be valid, and if it is valid, then it is like a valid notarization

[30-Oct-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
a notarization tx has 13 notary signatures, how do you suggest you will make them?

[30-Oct-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and like I said, since invalid notarizations are ignored, all you can do is make a valid notarization, even if you are able to make 13 notary signatures

[30-Oct-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
did you look at the tx 773e6ee5705023bc1b37ffa4c6fbcfc85d21412ad3ab50e0454e7e281c4952b6 I listed above? that is a notarization tx

[30-Oct-18 08:25 PM] TK#2921
So all the nodes have the list of all notary nodes? Where did they retrieve it?
Thanks for the tx do you have a BTC notarization tx as well?

[30-Oct-18 08:27 PM] SHossain#0007
all tx here represents BTC notarization https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/1P3rU1Nk1pmc2BiWC8dEy9bZa1ZbMp5jfg/transactions
