Kip 0 defines our guidelines

[12-Sep-19 02:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
and I ported over HIP400 as KIP400 with a few edits

[12-Sep-19 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would rather help write KIPs with others than write HIPs myself 😅

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] Slyris#2880
We could install an issue tracker tool on GitHub for KomodoPlatform with some options if you are interested

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] Slyris#2880
Let me know

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks!

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c maybe NNs could publicly vote on KIPs

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
but also, other parts of the community should have a vote

[12-Sep-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
lets get this on komodoplatform with issues enabled, would that solve this issue?

[12-Sep-19 02:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c yeah, fork to KomodoPlatform github, and enable issues, and that should solve it. My fork can be for my changes that I will send via PR

[12-Sep-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
@Slyris hopefully you are able to do this

[12-Sep-19 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
should be about 5 clicks in the github web gui

[12-Sep-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont change the komodoplatform repo

[12-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but I will ask @ca333 if we can open such a tools to this repository

{Reactions}
✅ 

[12-Sep-19 02:45 PM] Slyris#2880
Once I have the authorization I can definitely install a tool from the GitHub marketplace

[12-Sep-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris that sounds more complex than it is

[12-Sep-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are no things to install

[12-Sep-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
Fork that github repo, and enable Issues in the Settings

[12-Sep-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
that's it

[12-Sep-19 02:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
by default, github forks do not have issues enabled

[12-Sep-19 02:47 PM] Slyris#2880
Send me the repo to fork ?

[12-Sep-19 02:47 PM] Slyris#2880
KIP ?

[12-Sep-19 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's above?

[12-Sep-19 02:48 PM] Slyris#2880

[12-Sep-19 02:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's all doable via a few clicks on your mobile phone

[12-Sep-19 02:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am now confused @jl777c , best of luck

[12-Sep-19 02:49 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm at restaurant with my family

[12-Sep-19 02:49 PM] Slyris#2880
If we can wait 2 hours it's great.

`I have 30 discords with 994534594594954 channels`
194534594594900 of them over the other 29 isn't bad 😛

Just because it's a "Proposal" doesn't mean it will be adopted :troll:

I already see one place I forgot to replace HIP with KIP. Easy PR for somebody like @jorian to earn back honor

My KIP 0 is not written in blood

[12-Sep-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_doesn't participate in anything with a CoC_

[12-Sep-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
It most likely needs help to be fleshd out

[12-Sep-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
They are my ideas, that I think are good for KMD

[12-Sep-19 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
And they are the reason HIP400 is named that, the number schemes all mesh together, and that reduces insanity

[12-Sep-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
Instantly, by looking at a HIP or KIP, you know what the corresponding BIP or ZIP is

[12-Sep-19 03:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think defining exactly what things are "allowed" and not "allowed", socially, for our NNs, would be a good brand new KIP

[12-Sep-19 03:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
KIP 7xx are the brand new komodo-specific KIPS, that seemed appropriate

[12-Sep-19 03:14 PM] ca333#0118
thanks @dukeleto for setting this up - very much appreciated!

_will make his 1st PR to the kip about editing the license to not give `Free Software Foundation, Inc.` the copyrights and legal ownership_

[12-Sep-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
I just try to be useful for a bit and move out of the way

[12-Sep-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you misunderstand

[12-Sep-19 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is the copyright of the copyright document

[12-Sep-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can't make an MIT version of GPLv3 copyright document

[12-Sep-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's actually not and it still contains the examples 😛

[12-Sep-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
I very specifically migrated to GPLv3 to prevent Electric Coin Company from using anything

[12-Sep-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's just documentation, but it makes it hard for any for-profit company to use without asking us first. They can use it, but we would have grounds to sue

[12-Sep-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 go ahead and make all the things nice, i didn't add copyrights to everything

[12-Sep-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a super old repo

[12-Sep-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
created 2 years ago for Hush

[12-Sep-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
that i just forked into a kmd version

[12-Sep-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto specifically what I mean by "examples" is LICENSE#L623 and below

[12-Sep-19 03:19 PM] dukeleto#7326

Do you see what I was getting at about copyright attribution, having the only listed copyright belonging to FSF?
I think it would destroy the world as we know it if any such claim was ever lodged by them, but I can see the possibility of such a claim having legal merit

[12-Sep-19 07:29 PM] Slyris#2880
Some elegant cpp snippet i write this evening for people interesting in `ranges` with modern c++

```cpp
 std::size_t system_manager::update_systems(system_type system_type_to_update) noexcept
    {
        std::size_t nb_systems_updated = 0ull;
        auto &&current_sys_collection = systems_[system_type_to_update];
        for (auto &&sys :  current_sys_collection | ranges::views::filter(&base_system::is_enabled)) {
            sys->update();
            nb_systems_updated += 1;
        }
        return nb_systems_updated;
    }
```
