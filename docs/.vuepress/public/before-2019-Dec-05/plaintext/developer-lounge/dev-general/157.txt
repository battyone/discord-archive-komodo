lets say CSW was involved, so sanity and intelligence are not in play

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
I guess I would make a futarchy market asking if it is a good idea to consider this an attack, and to freeze all the money on both sides of the oracle by preventing that oracle from ever closing.

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
if the futarchy market says we should freeze the money, then we would.

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
then CSW wouldn't be incentivized to mess with Amoveo any more

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
by what justification to just confiscate the funds?

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
seems very draconian

[23-Mar-19 05:27 PM] zack#6467
Amoveo uses futarchy governance

[23-Mar-19 05:28 PM] zack#6467
if futarchy tells us to do any hard update or change anything, then we do

[23-Mar-19 05:28 PM] zack#6467
we don't have hierarchy

[23-Mar-19 05:28 PM] zack#6467
futarchy is the ideal way for communities to make good decisions

[23-Mar-19 05:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so this 50% ambiguity is indeed the worst case chain split event, effectively an attack. I guess it could just also be reversed, or partially confiscated

[23-Mar-19 05:30 PM] zack#6467
any hard update is possible once futarchy is involved. we could reverse it or partially confiscate or do anything at all

[23-Mar-19 05:31 PM] jl777c#5810
or even find out which side CSW was on and just declare the other side the winner

they are both doing the same thing symmetrically,

[23-Mar-19 05:31 PM] zack#6467
I don't see why we would treat them different

[24-Mar-19 02:25 AM] walrus#8604
Hi, Just a quick question

[24-Mar-19 02:25 AM] walrus#8604
I am trying to call asset-chain commands with RPC....like the curl request mentioned in the documentation:

[24-Mar-19 02:25 AM] walrus#8604
curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getwalletinfo", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/

[24-Mar-19 02:26 AM] walrus#8604
If I want to replicate the same in javascript (node.js), is it right to create an HTTP request with above mentioned parameters (with configured RPC port of asset-chain).
Is there any recommended node.js module (for webapps) to create these HTTP requests.

from browser you will have a CORS request problem, so just put CORS-anywhere inbetween.   works no probs.

[25-Mar-19 01:05 AM] MyName#0491
Anyone know what causes a node to continually drop peers (or at least think it has)?

[25-Mar-19 01:06 AM] MyName#0491
```
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=RFOX getblocktemplate                         
error code: -9
error message:
Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!
$ komodo-cli -ac_name=RFOX getpeerinfo | jq length
26```

[25-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
@MyName is getpeerinfo showing your own IP 26 times?

[25-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[25-Mar-19 02:06 AM] MyName#0491
nope

[25-Mar-19 02:07 AM] MyName#0491
2 for the pool (which is a different IP and server) and all of the rest are other people's nodes

[25-Mar-19 02:14 AM] Alright#0419
@MyName try restarting the node maybe?

[25-Mar-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
try
`komodo-cli -ac_name=RFOX getblocktemplate "{\"mode\": \"disablecb\"}"`

[25-Mar-19 02:15 AM] Alright#0419
same thing?

[25-Mar-19 07:20 AM] MyName#0491
it seems that when a "local" block (RPC) fails `komodo_check_deposit`, the daemon then decides that it has no peers for all RPC related calls and stays in that state until it gets a new block from one of the P2P peers

[25-Mar-19 07:21 AM] MyName#0491
after the new block from outside source, it behaves properly until another RPC block fails `komodo_check_deposit`

[25-Mar-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@MyName that sounds like a very good bug find. which branch/commit are you testing with?

[25-Mar-19 12:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
@MyName and let me know the exact RPC that you tested with

[25-Mar-19 02:19 PM] MyName#0491
@dukeleto it happens with labs/master and james' FSM, the oldest combination being 3 weeks ago to the newest as of 7 hrs ago
as for the calls, it's a `submitblock` that returns like `checkdeposit: ht.393534 checktoshis 0.00980000 overflow.0 total 0.01000000 strangeout.0` in stdout (obviously a fees issue in the block) and after that `getblocktemplate` fails (as does at least one of the payment calls, but I'm not sure exactly which one).
I haven't tried anything else yet because it requires such a specific fail to begin with that I can't catch inside that 60-90 second window very often.
I working on an unrelated pool that doesn't have that issue, so when I get that one done I might try creating intentionally bad blocks to see if I can force it to try other calls manually.

ZecWallet now has Payment Requests!

Request ZEC from a Sapling address by sending them an encrypted Payment Request using ZecWallet. Both the request and the payment are completely private.

[26-Mar-19 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
seems like a pretty good feature that KMD wallets should learn how to do, and a great use of the memo field to do a completely shielded invoice request + payment

[26-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
is this such a big deal?

[26-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
can just send an encrypted message in opreturn and have an autoprocessing of it

[26-Mar-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess rpc level would be sendinvoice, listinvoices, approveinvoice

[26-Mar-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
GUI wallets supporting it easily is the big deal, bitpay/btcpay have the concept of invoices

[26-Mar-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
that stuff above purely uses the memo field, this is shielded only

[26-Mar-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
and it just parses the memo field like email headers

[26-Mar-19 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
to find the address/amount requested, it seems

[26-Mar-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so making rpc for gui to use seems the thing. and memo field/opreturn, really not much different

[26-Mar-19 08:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
the above GUI needed no RPC changes at all in ZEC, I don't think

[26-Mar-19 08:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's purely a GUI wallet feature

[26-Mar-19 08:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
z_sendmany

[26-Mar-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly you can code the rpc functionality the gui, so that no other gui can use the functionality

[26-Mar-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
or you can put it in the core, so all gui are able to easily do this

[26-Mar-19 08:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
but the wallet needs to be a bit smart to parse memo fields and save some data (sent memo fields are not saved anywhere by default, only received), and a few edge cases like that

[26-Mar-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
what I am saying is that it is a one day task to implement a general invoce rpc

[26-Mar-19 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
and what exactly are the benefits of that?

[26-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
all gui can add the invoicing functionality

[26-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
confused, are you saying it is better to be a proprietary direct in the gui thing vs rpc level?

[26-Mar-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
or that this invoicing has no benefits

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
i don't understand why RPC level changes are wanted when it can be done at a higher level

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
and GUI wallets would have to write much more code to support your new RPCs

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
?

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
sendinvoice address amount reason

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's mostly sending a special memo field and parsing it, some string parsing

[26-Mar-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
listinvoices

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
approveinvoice txid

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that is much more code than doing all the opreturn creation and parsing?

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
you want to add new RPCs, which means GUI wallets writing a ton of code to call them, deal with them, etc... All the code to send/receive z_sendmany should be there

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
no opreturn

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
memo fields

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
sapling only, is all i care about

[26-Mar-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i am talking about taddr support

[26-Mar-19 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is very different, and I can see the want for custom RPCs for that

[26-Mar-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
which can also do zaddr automatically if the destination is a zaddr

[26-Mar-19 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
businesses don't want to broadcast their invoices to the entire world, is my gut feeling

[26-Mar-19 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
shielded invoices are very interesting to them

[26-Mar-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
hence the reason I said encrypted

[26-Mar-19 08:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
i fully support you writing a proper invoicing system that nicely handles taddr + zaddr vin/vouts üòÉ

[26-Mar-19 08:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
might be a nice use of cryptoconditions, or maybe it's even simpler than that

[26-Mar-19 08:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
invoice CC sounds nice, tho

[26-Mar-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
invoice CC would be a good learning CC

[26-Mar-19 08:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe @mrlynch can cut teeth on invoice CC on his way to the vault CC :abusedsmily: , or @blackjok3r who has become a coding monster of late

@jl777c what API/function should I look at if I want to create new KMD wallet seed phrases from the CLI ? Not sure if I want mm or iguana or where to look

[26-Mar-19 08:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
usually I would use agama GUI but I want to automate something and also understand how it works on a deeper level

[26-Mar-19 08:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"calcaddress\",\"passphrase\":\"SEED\"}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"calcaddress\",\"passphrase\":\"SEED 1\"}"

[26-Mar-19 08:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
something like that?

[26-Mar-19 08:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what do you want to do this for? 
MM and iguana can both use a KMD WIF as input to generate wif/address for all other coins/

[26-Mar-19 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r non-digital backup of an entire wallet via seed phrase instead of backing up individual private keys or WIFs

[26-Mar-19 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wasnt even aware you could enter your own seed phrase to the wallet

[26-Mar-19 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
i don't want to

[26-Mar-19 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
i want to generate a new one

[26-Mar-19 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
not make a custom seed phrase, to be clear

[26-Mar-19 09:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
why can't each of my wallet.dat's have a seed phrase that I can use to backup all addresses in that wallet? Why is this all so hard still?

[26-Mar-19 09:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
managing important addresses/keys is still a nightmare in 2019, and light wallets have lots of problems, but backing them up via seed phrases is still massively better than having to constantly backup wallet.dat files and managing thousands of versions of the same wallet.dat files and git repos of wallet.dat files and backups of git repos of wallet.dat files. Maybe I am just frustrated with managing wallets and all I see is it getting more complex as time goes on

[26-Mar-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX where can I read the documentation to `calcaddress` and friends ?

[26-Mar-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
do we have a website with those docs? Not sure I have seen it

I see that I have not come across yet I don't think we have that in iguana / mm

[26-Mar-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
I guess I need to see how the agama GUI does it
