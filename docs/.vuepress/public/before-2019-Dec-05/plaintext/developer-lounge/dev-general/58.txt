[13-Nov-18 10:23 AM] D.rabbani#9094
stuck in the explorer thing for two days

[13-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just restart the daemon with -reindex without stopping the pool

[13-Nov-18 10:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or resync the daemon with the pool running

[13-Nov-18 10:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
already done the reindex but no hope

[13-Nov-18 10:24 AM] D.rabbani#9094
any better explorer ?

[13-Nov-18 10:25 AM] D.rabbani#9094
or if you can give the link for the specific explorer with no bugs ?

[13-Nov-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
dexstats.info uses the insight explorers, all 40+ are working fine

[13-Nov-18 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
bugs are not in the explorer, but something about your setup

[13-Nov-18 10:26 AM] D.rabbani#9094
pardon me @jl777c  i wil look into it for sure

[13-Nov-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
@jl777c  we currently just want one explorer for our coin

[13-Nov-18 10:28 AM] D.rabbani#9094
there is an issue of loading block i think i am missing some step

[13-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
get the komodod with the -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -timestampindex=1 synced before doing anything with the explorer

[13-Nov-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
once the daemon is in sync, then install the explorer

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then there wont be any issue about loading blocks

[13-Nov-18 10:31 AM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks alot @jl777c  probably this is the key we  were missing we will try it now and let you know

Looking for information on the Blockchain starter kit can anybody give me a rundown on how it works and if there are costs?

[13-Nov-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
contact @siu - Chainmakers

[13-Nov-18 12:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
thanks! contact done ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Nov-18 12:24 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks @jl777c  it actually worked thanks alot for help ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Nov-18 04:13 PM] Mylo#8306
@Fartmasta anyone can create a stablecoin provided they have the backing.   there could be lots of stablecoins in the future - or even gov sanctioned stablecoins.  that is an economic, jurisdiction/legal problem.  if they are UTXO (bitcoin protocol) based, they can be tokenized and used around the kmd ecosystem with a gatewayCC contract.

[13-Nov-18 04:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@D.rabbani @CORS1ER 

I'm seeing a lot of new devs show up.

Just a reminder, the new streamlined documentation that's targeted for new developers is almost done.

You can use it in advance here:

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/#introduction

We hope to get it to the main website very soon. Just finishing a few things -- namely, the gateways smart contract and some instructions on creating a cc pubkey address, and then a final check down to make sure all is good.

[13-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 
Who designed the gateways cc?

[13-Nov-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i did

[13-Nov-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
based on multigateway, but more decentralized

[13-Nov-18 05:02 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Hello!

[13-Nov-18 05:03 PM] IndieBlock#3081
In need of a extra pair of hands at all?

[13-Nov-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes! what languages do you code in

[13-Nov-18 05:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

When you get a chance I'll need to question you. I'm looking through the tutorial for gateways, as that's all I've found that's available. Not enough to really dig in.

[13-Nov-18 05:08 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Hey @jl777c  C/C++/NodeJs/GoLang + Any markup/scripting language really

fairly language agnostic providing its sensible.

@IndieBlock what interests you? sounds like you can work on various things

[13-Nov-18 05:11 PM] IndieBlock#3081
I'm happy working on pretty much any aspect (core through to integrations) point in the direction you want me and im happy to make that work ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Nov-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can do core level coding, then custom CC.

auction CC would be good to have

[13-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ya, an auction CC would be very useful.

[13-Nov-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
I can outline a design for it, if there is someone that can code it

[13-Nov-18 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c if you describe it, somebody will code it

[13-Nov-18 05:15 PM] IndieBlock#3081
If you could outline a design ide be happy to draw something up in regards to a backend (and then code it)

[13-Nov-18 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@IndieBlock https://github.com/jl777/komodo/tree/master/src/cc is where all the current CC contract code lives

[13-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
well, not exactly. it takes a bit of mind bending to understand what it means to make a custom CC

[13-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
please read the mastering cryptoconditions first

[13-Nov-18 05:16 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Of course

[13-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can descript the special CC tx that would be needed to implement auction CC, then that is the first step

[13-Nov-18 05:16 PM] IndieBlock#3081
thats what i meant by draw something up, that would involve getting to grips with anything ide need to use ðŸ˜ƒ

[13-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, with lots of help from this channel + jl777, it seems possible. and if the new CC is not too different from existing CC's

[13-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@IndieBlock not sure how your brain works, but if I can read tests for something, it helps me understand: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/cryptoconditions.py

yes, auction CC would be modeled based on the locking of token, specifying auction terms, then at the end of the auction the winner would be able to get the item auctioned

[13-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
i wrote those tests for cryptoconditions, it shows the sequence of RPCs you use to do various things

[13-Nov-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
everyone that didnt win would get a refund

[13-Nov-18 05:18 PM] IndieBlock#3081
@dukeleto I can usually work out how something works from tests etc also ^

[13-Nov-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
would be nice if a dutch auction could also be implemented, then it could be used for ICO sales

[13-Nov-18 05:18 PM] IndieBlock#3081
So it sounds like i can be of use ðŸ˜ƒ that's brilliant ^

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, so many new CCs are waiting to be built. We are making it easier every day. Better error checking, more tests, more CCs, GUIs to make+Generate CC's are being developed

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes we have foundational CC that still needs to be created

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
people have Go/Rust bindings I think, it's growing fast

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but also automated tests

[13-Nov-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
GUI

[13-Nov-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but the most powerful is a new CC

[13-Nov-18 05:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@IndieBlock 

I'm on the marketing team - a  junior web dev pleb and technical documentation writer. 

If you are able to get a CC template together, the marketing team will be very grateful. We try to thank people by promoting your personal projects on our blog, and we're looking for other ways as well. A few things in the works, though nothing settled yet.

[13-Nov-18 05:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
our automated tests have not kept pace with jl777, so if anybody wants to add new tests for new CC's, please do! I can review/help with tests

[13-Nov-18 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
which of course increases the backlog of required docs, tests and GUI

[13-Nov-18 05:21 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Okay, i will be back in around ~30 minutes if anyone would be up for dialogue on moving forward.

@Bryan_Beus  Honestly i'm very feedback oriented so by saying that you give me good motivation to work on it hahah

[13-Nov-18 05:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
An auction CC would absolutely be worth the time to write the docs.

[13-Nov-18 05:21 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Its worth the time to write docs for anything you write ^ standard.

[13-Nov-18 05:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's really not so hard tow rite the docs for CCs, now that I have a basic template. But it helps greatly if the developer has all the rpc calls and examples in order before handing them to me. Otherwise, I wind up trying to chase down information and it triples the time.

[13-Nov-18 05:22 PM] IndieBlock#3081
Right talk to you all in ~30mins :

[13-Nov-18 05:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
sounds good

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I've read through gateways tutorial.

[13-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It is fine for a tutorial, but I need more basic and introductory material.

[13-Nov-18 05:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And there are no code examples.

When you're available, I have a few questions.

[13-Nov-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[13-Nov-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
now is good

[13-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
this gives a bit of background on MGW (yes, from 4 years ago!)

[13-Nov-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
first step is to understand MGW

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
reading

[13-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, so question

[13-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The idea of MGW seems to be broader than just an exchange, but maybe I'm wrong.

I say that because as I read through the tutorial, I see that there can be binding between tokens, gateways, and oracles. Maybe I'm wrong, but this makes it seem like gateways shouldn't be described as just an exchange?

How would you most simply describe gateways, considering these things?

[13-Nov-18 05:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the gateways CC implements a gateway

[13-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the exchanging is by a different mechanism

[13-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles is a helper CC that helps gateways see data from the external chain

[13-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
how can we describe a gateway? I've read through all the material available, and do not yet have a simple description that captures the vision.

[13-Nov-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
what a gateway does is creates a token from deposit of a real crypto

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and when that token is withdrawn, it is converted back into the real crypto

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you know, just like what an exchange does

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, that is much simpler.

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you deposit BTC, you get a balance in the exchange

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
you withdraw from exchange and get BTC in the address you specify

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
in between, it exists as some DB entry

[13-Nov-18 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
for gateways CC, it exists as an assets CC token

[13-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, good. 

Let me see if in the tutorial documentation I can get all the rpc calls real quick.

The only other thing I'm sure I need is an example of each rpc call. (I do not have access to my other node at the moment; it is indisposed.)

[13-Nov-18 05:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, a flow of "I entered exactly this", followed by "I received this exact output." For each command, all the way through the whole cc flow.

[13-Nov-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL do you have this sort of thing?

[13-Nov-18 06:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the TUI does this
