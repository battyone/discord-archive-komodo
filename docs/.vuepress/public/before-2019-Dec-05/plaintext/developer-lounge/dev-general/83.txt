Although its still going to print all those prints when it adds back to the real mempool ü§î

[14-Dec-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
are these prints indicating a massive problem?

[14-Dec-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or can they just be ignored

[14-Dec-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so ... but the wallet is getting corrupted

[14-Dec-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I am having a real hard time tracking it down

[14-Dec-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I hav tried to add loops to clear orphaned txs but that made it even worse

[14-Dec-18 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
is there some way I can pass a blocknotify script a static argument

[14-Dec-18 11:02 AM] Alright#0419
for example `-blocknotify=staker.py <chain>` something like this

[14-Dec-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe: -blocknotify="staker.py <chain>"

[14-Dec-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if that doesnt work, then you can use a fixed file location for the parameter

[14-Dec-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
or the name of the .py script, can be chain.py and it can look at argv[0]

[14-Dec-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r @jl777c I tested ac_period in stakedchain repo

[14-Dec-18 11:22 AM] Alright#0419
let me test the komodo repo before you merge it please

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it earlier... all I did was a founders chain wihtout period

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and then a chain the same with a period

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they worked... the only thing I was worried abnoput was thjat he args didnt work

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
already merged, nevermind lol

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
will still test it again

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Alright#0419
did you add magic change to komodo version?

[14-Dec-18 11:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
also might weant to try syncing ZEX to make sure existing founders is still right.

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
I merged it, but was thinking maybe we use -ac_founders=<period>

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that sounds like a better idea

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, but that would break ZEX

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if you can keep it backwards compatible

[14-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so your way is backward compatible

[14-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
though I think if we didnt change the magic for ac_founders=1, with the period it would be backward compatible

[14-Dec-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt change he magic at first until Alright made me do it üòÇ

[14-Dec-18 11:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
founders = 1 would be right for ZEX wihtout the magic

[14-Dec-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
updated jl777 branch with -ac_founders=<period> change

[14-Dec-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a very good option!

[14-Dec-18 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
similar concept to a super block on DASH

[14-Dec-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
just happens 100% of the time to a static address as opposed to voting

[14-Dec-18 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
can work the same way though

[14-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if jl777 branch tests out, I will update to FSM

[14-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know

[14-Dec-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
this sort of rule will make it problematic for pools that dont use the blackjokr method

[14-Dec-18 12:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha yes ...

[14-Dec-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only chains my pool struggles with are -ac_private

[14-Dec-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
im sure it could be amde to work, but I couldnt get it to after wasting half a day on it

[14-Dec-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
likely after sapling is wel and truly activated I can have a go again when there isnt 2 diffrent address being used.

`this sort of rule will make it problematic for pools that dont use the blackjokr method`
The only real "problem" is if the pool can create/sign the tx
`github.com/miketout/bitgo-utxo-lib` <- goes a long way towards solving many of the past problems

[14-Dec-18 12:26 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c latest jl777 core dumped as soon as a block was mined

can you walk me through how to get backtrace again please

[14-Dec-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`gdb --args ./komodod`

pushed fix to jl777 branch

[14-Dec-18 12:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have always checked something like that in a seperate if above... the if statemnts compare left to right? so if the scriptPubKeyIn in this case, is size of 0, then the second part of the if is not called?

[14-Dec-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
&& and || evaluate left to right and abort if condition is resolved

Cool thanks... always learnign here.. trial and error can be a bad way at times... I think knowing this (although now it seems obvious lol) might have saved me lots of time.

[14-Dec-18 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Attempting to redo mempool fix without a second mempool... it really doesnt need it.

[14-Dec-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
got it working

[14-Dec-18 02:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[14-Dec-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it litterally worked thje first time I tested it üòÇ  had to go ss prints to check...

[14-Dec-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems horribly slow with full blocks

[14-Dec-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to test he old method aswell.

[14-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
what is wrong with current method?

[14-Dec-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if it works, why to fix it?

[14-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its the same with a temp mempool

[14-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
fill the block with txs and it just hangs for ages procesing them

[14-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems it only adds back 2-4 tx per ioteration

[14-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with a full block its taking 800 loops

[14-Dec-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt even sync

[14-Dec-18 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and this is on a VERY fast computer

[14-Dec-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
> if it works, why to fix it?
because it doesnt work üòÇ

totally destroyed it

weird its doing 832 iterations every time though ...

[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
@jorian don't think it has a limit

[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
limited by block size

[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] Alright#0419
other than tx size limit which is 100k if I remember correctly

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
tx size has a limit

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181

transparent sendmany

[14-Dec-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will get about 2000 vouts from a single vin

[14-Dec-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
going to use jl777/FSM to do this same test... just incase something here is diffrent (although it should be exactly equal) 
sending about 1000 sendtoaddress just locks the miner up

[14-Dec-18 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if the order is backwards, it could end up being very slow

[14-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I found up why its locking up. tyring fix now

[14-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but yes it appears to be horribly slow.

[14-Dec-18 03:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
granted I am fiulling the mempool with txs that are all dependant on each other

[14-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe we just need to add them back without all the mempool checks

[14-Dec-18 03:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are invlid they should never propagate

[14-Dec-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not good to have known invalid tx in mempool... but if it is recreating a mempool that only had valid tx, then should be ok

[14-Dec-18 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its quite rare that there is an invliad tx

[14-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
however, the txs in the mempool could also be included in the block...

[14-Dec-18 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
especially one that was valid before the block was processed

[14-Dec-18 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they would be put back into the mempool

[14-Dec-18 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
need to see where the block txs are removed from the mempool

[14-Dec-18 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OR

[14-Dec-18 03:33 PM] blackjok3r#3181
anything thats added to the mempool, can be removed from the tmpmempool
