```./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK getaccountaddress ""```

[22-Jun-19 11:04 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
this gives me RSFqBQTfATXf22C1Ug65zKr1pfggkytZwb

[22-Jun-19 11:05 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I have created 2 another addresses

[22-Jun-19 11:05 AM] gcharang#6833
`./komodo-cli validateaddress RSFqBQTfATXf22C1Ug65zKr1pfggkytZwb`

[22-Jun-19 11:05 AM] gcharang#6833
you will see a pubkey in tehe output

[22-Jun-19 11:05 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
yes

[22-Jun-19 11:05 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
scriptPubKey  and pubkey

[22-Jun-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
pubkey

[22-Jun-19 11:06 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what is scriptPubKey

[22-Jun-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
if you want the same pubkey in another daemon, use `dumpprivkey` to get the privkey and import it on the other chain

[22-Jun-19 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
https://learnmeabitcoin.com/glossary/scriptPubKey

[22-Jun-19 11:08 AM] gcharang#6833
not necessary to understand it for dapp level stuff, but one of the basics of bitcoin script and utxo level validation

[22-Jun-19 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`mykey ..is just a random string I put there... according to the command help ..`
the "random string" would come *after* the key as an account name, if you didn't put the key before that then that's why it errored

[22-Jun-19 11:08 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
dumpprivkey private key gave me ..string starting with  'U' ..i guess it's my private key

[22-Jun-19 11:08 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[22-Jun-19 11:09 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```the "random string" would come after the key as an account name, if you didn't put the key before that then that's why it errored```

Didn't understand

[22-Jun-19 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you wrote that you did `./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK importprivkey "mykey"`
and that you just put in a random string
Unless I read wrong, that's why you got an error
it must be
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK importprivkey theKeyHere "accountNameHere"`

[22-Jun-19 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
account name is best left as just "" because most of the account features are no longer used

[22-Jun-19 11:24 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
theKeyHere -- name of the key?

[22-Jun-19 11:24 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
or actual key

[22-Jun-19 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the actual key, there is no "name of the key"

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok..

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK tokencreate TAK 10 "creating a TAK token"```

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "some inputs signed not with -pubkey=pk"
}

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
getting error

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] gcharang#6833
did you start the daemon with the `-pubkey` parameter?

[22-Jun-19 11:25 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
yes

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```./komodod -pubkey=0221c3b60e61d9fadb7d4a597a1e58bb6157c1878232f1c2756ad3a41e05937da1 -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -addnode=138.201.136.145 &
```

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
this is command I ran

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] gcharang#6833
does the wallet have balance?

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
1 sec

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] gcharang#6833
`getbalance`

[22-Jun-19 11:26 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
23.33095000

[22-Jun-19 11:29 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
1 sec..every address has different pubkey?

[22-Jun-19 11:29 AM] gcharang#6833
yes

[22-Jun-19 11:30 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
why.. 1 pubkey can generate multiple address correct?

[22-Jun-19 11:30 AM] gcharang#6833
no

[22-Jun-19 11:31 AM] gcharang#6833
1 pubkey can generate different addresses for different blockchains
0221c3b60e61d9fadb7d4a597a1e58bb6157c1878232f1c2756ad3a41e05937da1 can generate 1 R address for KMD and the smartchains
a address starting with 1 for BTC so on..

[22-Jun-19 11:32 AM] gcharang#6833
https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php
enter 1 address here, you can see its equivalent address for ETH,dash,btc etc

so you are saying 

1 pubkey -> x blockchain -> 1 address
                  -> y blockchain -> 1 address
                  -> z blockchain -> 1 address

in the python code, the 
```
BASE58_PREFIXES = {'PUBKEY_ADDR': 60,
```
will be different for each coin

[22-Jun-19 11:35 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
1 account will have multiple public keys and balance is on account level correct?

[22-Jun-19 11:35 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no account

[22-Jun-19 11:35 AM] gcharang#6833
it was deprecated

[22-Jun-19 11:36 AM] gcharang#6833
accounts were a collection of addresses

[22-Jun-19 11:36 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
how to check balance of an address

[22-Jun-19 11:37 AM] gcharang#6833
./komodo-cli getreceivedbyaddress "RJSDZjp7kjBNhHsbECDE1jwYNK7af41pZN"

[22-Jun-19 11:40 AM] gcharang#6833
`listreceivedbyaddress` is better

[22-Jun-19 11:42 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
that pubkey didn't have balance

[22-Jun-19 11:44 AM] gcharang#6833
`sendtoaddress`

[22-Jun-19 11:44 AM] gcharang#6833
to the address of that pubkey

[22-Jun-19 11:45 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes..this address got the balance but same error

[22-Jun-19 11:45 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```"error": "cant find normal inputs" ```

[22-Jun-19 11:46 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
actually error changed now

[22-Jun-19 11:47 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I need precise input of 1 coin for this?

[22-Jun-19 11:47 AM] gcharang#6833

this is address who's pubkey  I am using

are you using tjhis command?
`tokencreate TAK 10 "creating a TAK token"`

[22-Jun-19 11:49 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
changed to ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=RICK tokencreate TOK 100 "creating a TOK token"```

[22-Jun-19 11:50 AM] gcharang#6833
100 is the amount of coins you want to use to create tokens -> will create 100 * 10^8 tokens
to create 100 tokens, use `0.00000100`

[22-Jun-19 11:51 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ohh got it

[22-Jun-19 11:55 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
but it will be same price ..doesn't matter how much supply you create correct?

[22-Jun-19 11:55 AM] gcharang#6833
you burn 0.00000100 RICK to create 100 TOK tokens

I am syncing the RICK chain will test

[22-Jun-19 12:06 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
thanks

[22-Jun-19 12:07 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
till that time, I will try with some other pubkey

[22-Jun-19 12:23 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Other pubkey didn't work too

[22-Jun-19 12:30 PM] gcharang#6833
I just tested it, it works @coinmonks || CoinCodeCap

[22-Jun-19 12:39 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what i am doing wrong

[22-Jun-19 01:00 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
these are the correct steps 

1) start the chain without the pubkey parameter
2) getnewaddress
3) validateaddress
4)setpubkey
5) go to faucet and get coins for this address

[22-Jun-19 01:00 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
it worked ..thanks to @gcharang

[22-Jun-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap @gcharang FYI 1 pubkey actually corresponds to TWO addresses (one compressed, one uncompressed), which really represent the same public key integer in two different formats. Both are 2 different valid addresses for the pubkey. Each format of the pubkey still corresponds to ONE single private key. This comes from BTC, not anything special to KMD

[22-Jun-19 01:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
In case things were too simple for you 😃

[22-Jun-19 02:16 PM] TheTrunk#1040
One more q about the rewards. If a locktime in transaction is specified as a blockheight and not a timestamp, the utxo is accumulating the reward too right? And in that case to calculate the reward I should get a block time (of that block in which the tx was) to get the locktime as a timestamp right?

[22-Jun-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
only via timestamp

[22-Jun-19 02:23 PM] TheTrunk#1040
Aha so blockheight locktimes are not getting rewards. Ok, thanks 😃
