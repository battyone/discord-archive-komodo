well, 102% for the portion of the network that is participating

[23-Mar-19 01:40 AM] zack#6467
the attacking version needs to have some signal of how much power they have, to know when to activate the attack

[23-Mar-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
2% bonus paid via some offchain handshake protocol

[23-Mar-19 01:40 AM] zack#6467
even if the 2% is paid off-chain, that doesn't make up for 100% lost on-chain

[23-Mar-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
but you wont know who to punish

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] zack#6467
the attacker blocks have the signal in them

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
all is the same until they unleash the attack

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] zack#6467
we can censor all the blocks with the signal

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
no signal in blocks

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] zack#6467
they need a signal to know when they have >50%

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just a new time delay attack daemon

[23-Mar-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
encrypted comms made via totally different channels

[23-Mar-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i think all looks the same until the moment the attack activates

[23-Mar-19 01:42 AM] zack#6467
so the encrypted messages wont be on-chain?

[23-Mar-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
totally offchain

[23-Mar-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
payments in a different currency

[23-Mar-19 01:42 AM] zack#6467
then I could pretend to participate in the attack even though I am not, to trick them into thinking they have >50% hashpower when they do not

[23-Mar-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe... but only the attacker version is able to properly do the communications to the attacker, takes time to reverse engineer that

[23-Mar-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the signal is very subtle

[23-Mar-19 01:44 AM] zack#6467
if it isn't open source, then it could be stealing private keys. no one would use it.

[23-Mar-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you believe that?

[23-Mar-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
most users seem to like prebuilt binaries

[23-Mar-19 01:44 AM] zack#6467
I guess a miner doesn't need to have any coins in its account to mine

[23-Mar-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems any chain that is specifically targeted with such sophisticated attack would have a hard time to withstand it. diversity of independent chains and have the ecosystem survive even if a few chains succumb

[23-Mar-19 01:47 AM] zack#6467
the miners dont' even run the code. the mining pools do

[23-Mar-19 01:47 AM] zack#6467
mining pools need to hold a lot of veo

[23-Mar-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes 10 nodes for most coins and that is vast majority of hashrate

[23-Mar-19 01:47 AM] zack#6467
it would be hard to get them to use compiled code

[23-Mar-19 01:48 AM] zack#6467
maybe the mining pools aren't even running nodes any more. They just forward the work to the attacker's pool.

[23-Mar-19 01:48 AM] zack#6467
so the attacker is the only one running a modified node

[23-Mar-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
when you lost majority hashrate, i dont think there is a defense

[23-Mar-19 01:49 AM] zack#6467
but then we could delete all the block rewards he pays out

[23-Mar-19 01:49 AM] zack#6467
I think locking up block rewards for a week is a solution

[23-Mar-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
seems it leads to chain split fork

[23-Mar-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe that is deterrent enough

[23-Mar-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so the attacker would need to be more patient and have the attack be much slower

[23-Mar-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
like first refuse to increase blocksize, even though blocks are full

[23-Mar-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then to suggest some convoluted scheme where you have a separate blockchain hidden, but still there

[23-Mar-19 01:51 AM] zack#6467
in Amoveo that wouldn't work. the futarchy markets that determine how we should change the blocksize are off-chain.

[23-Mar-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and then you slowly deprecate all the main rpc calls

[23-Mar-19 01:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jl777c  sounds eerily familiar

[23-Mar-19 01:52 AM] zack#6467
you can't change any part of consensus until you have >50%, and I think locking up the reward for a week makes the nash equilibrium so the attacker can never get 50%

[23-Mar-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC was successfully attacked in this way

[23-Mar-19 01:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Exactly

[23-Mar-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the fee market acting as a bribe

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] zack#6467
I haven't been watching bitcoin enough to know what you are talking about

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been an absolute horror show

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] zack#6467
is there some link that summarizes the story?

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
they changed so much that basically everything that uses BTC needs to be updated

[23-Mar-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the most used rpc calls deprecated

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
no backward compatibility at all, more like anti compatibility on purpose

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
segwit is just crazy

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] zack#6467
interesting. I wonder if this is an opportunity for some new blockchain devs to lead bitcoin

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] zack#6467
if enough users aren't happy with the direction of development

[23-Mar-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and their excuse was that hardfork was impossible, yet they did a hardfork a few months ago to fix the double spend bug

[23-Mar-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
users arent affected much by these shenanigans

[23-Mar-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
just devs

[23-Mar-19 01:55 AM] zack#6467
too bad

[23-Mar-19 02:00 AM] zack#6467
I guess if there are only a handful of mining pools, the attacker might get them all to update almost simultaneously, and we wont have time to prevent the attack.

[23-Mar-19 09:17 AM] Mcrypt#4468
Came across the airgap wallet, which is basically two phones, one offline signing the tx and sending it via qr code to the other phone which than sends it to the chain.  Maybe someone like @lukechilds  could add kmd to the airgap wallet? It's on github and the developer are happy to get any support to add more coins. https://airgap.it/

AirGap - Your old smartphone is your new 'hardware wallet'
With the AirGap two device approach secure key handling becomes more accessible. The AirGap Vault is installed on a dedicated or old smartphone that has no connection to any network, thus is air gapped. The AirGap Wallet is installed on a every-day smartphone.

I didn't know it, I recently bought an Ellipal that works airgapped too. I will have a look at this

[23-Mar-19 09:25 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I can pay a bounty to have komodo supported

[23-Mar-19 09:28 AM] Mcrypt#4468
I think it would be great for whales to have a super secure way to claim interest or at least send kmd around.

[23-Mar-19 09:29 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Airgapped signing is my favourite

im trying to gather up a theory of trust. So we can more clearly think about and talk about the different kinds of trust.
It is based on our discussion from yesterday.

it proposes some open problems

[23-Mar-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you think of chainlink and RLAY?

[23-Mar-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the chainlink model can be mapped on top of the existing oracles CC, by adding aggregation functions. I know you dont like those, so maybe there are flaws with chainlink?

[23-Mar-19 04:36 PM] zack#6467
chainlink is aggregating some trusted feeds right? That just does not work

[23-Mar-19 04:37 PM] zack#6467
It is trust level 4.1, right?

[23-Mar-19 04:37 PM] jl777c#5810
####
Result Aggregation Once the oracles have revealed their results to the oracle contract, their results will be fed to the aggregating contract. The aggregating contract
tallies the collective results and calculates a weighted answer. The validity of each
oracle response is then reported to the reputation contract. Finally, the weighted
answer is returned to the specified contract function in USER-SC.
Detecting outlying or incorrect values is a problem that is specific to each type
of data feed and application. For instance, detecting and rejecting outlying answers
before averaging may be necessary for numeric data but not boolean. For this reason,
there will not be a specific aggregating contract, but a configurable contract address
which is specified by the purchaser. ChainLink will include a standard set of aggregating contracts, but customized contracts may also be specified, provided they
conform to the standard calculation interface.

[23-Mar-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
...

[23-Mar-19 04:38 PM] zack#6467
they can't find a secure way to aggregate, because it is not possible.
Giving the users a bunch of aggregating tools doesn't mean they will magically find a way to use them to make something secure.

[23-Mar-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
We suggest a well known solution to this problem, namely the use of a commit /
reveal scheme. In a first round, oracles send CHAINLINK-SC cryptographic commitments to their responses. After CHAINLINK-SC has received a quorum of responses,
it initiates a second round in which oracles reveal their responses.

[23-Mar-19 04:39 PM] zack#6467
oh, they use commit reveal?

[23-Mar-19 04:39 PM] zack#6467
that helps a lot, it might not be 4.1 then

[23-Mar-19 04:40 PM] zack#6467
so if they are doing commit-reveal, then they want to go with the bitcoin hivemind model of oracle.

[23-Mar-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
their initial:
1: Wait until Req is received from USER-SC.
2: sid ←$ SID
3: Broadcast (request,sid).
4: Wait until set C of 2f + 1 messages (commit, ci = Commitri
(Ai),sid) from distinct
Oi are received.
5: Broadcast (committed,sid).
6: Wait until set D of f + 1 distinct valid decommitments (decommit,(ri
, Ai),sid)
are received where, for some A, all Ai = A.
7: Send (Answer, A,sid) to USER-SC.

[23-Mar-19 04:40 PM] zack#6467
that requires that the oracles make some big security deposits, or hold a votecoin

[23-Mar-19 04:41 PM] zack#6467
because a commit-reveal still eventually has the reveal step, and that step can be used to have a trust-free bribe

[23-Mar-19 04:41 PM] jl777c#5810
they want to get to:
The off-chain aggregation system we propose for ChainLink, with accompanying
security proof sketches, may be found in Appendix A. It makes use of a distributed
protocol based on threshold signatures that provides resistance to freeloading by
f < n/3 oracles. We believe resistance to freeloading is an interesting new technical
problem.

[23-Mar-19 04:42 PM] zack#6467
is the threshold signature supposed to prevent the trust-free bribes?

[23-Mar-19 04:43 PM] zack#6467
I think I can make a general proof that you can't prevent these bribes

[23-Mar-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems they are focused on preventing freeloading

[23-Mar-19 04:43 PM] zack#6467
In Amoveo, a typical oracle only has 1 reporter who makes 1 report, in a single transaction. That is the nash equilibrium.

[23-Mar-19 04:44 PM] zack#6467
so I guess everyone is "freeloading" from participating in Amoveo's oracle

[23-Mar-19 04:44 PM] zack#6467
it isn't a problem for our oracle's security model

[23-Mar-19 04:44 PM] zack#6467
I guess because we aren't based on aggregating trusted feeds.

[23-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems RLAY is the same: As mentioned in 5, each proposition pool has one associated Aggregation Result.
This Aggregation Result can be seen as the consensus for that proposition pool.
We construct an Aggregation Function in line with 8, to satisfy the requirements
of Strategy-Proofness and Collusion-Strategy-Proofness as outlined in 3.

[23-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
With the background of 8, we choose the weighted median over the propositions
in a proposition pool as our aggregation function, as it satisfies those requirements. Together with Proof-of-Coherence and the Payment Function this guarantees the truth-tracking property for the Rlay DIN.

[23-Mar-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
###
so why is everybody aggregating if it doesnt work?

[23-Mar-19 04:46 PM] zack#6467
that is bandwagon fallacy

[23-Mar-19 04:47 PM] zack#6467
Just because lots of people do something, doesn't mean it is good to do

[23-Mar-19 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so these math proofs are just proving some useless theorems?

[23-Mar-19 04:47 PM] zack#6467
I see that you copy pasted some references to proofs, but I have never seem them.

[23-Mar-19 04:48 PM] zack#6467
Hard to judge something I have not seen

[23-Mar-19 04:49 PM] zack#6467
where are you reading this from?

[23-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
their whitepapers

[23-Mar-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but i will trust you that aggregation wont work, so i wont bother with those

[23-Mar-19 04:50 PM] zack#6467
threshold signatures are nice for saving space. but they don't prevent an attacker from bribing the reporters.
