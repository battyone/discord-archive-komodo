"result": "error",
  "error": "some inputs signed not with -pubkey=pk"

[13-Sep-19 06:21 AM] redp1ll#3268
I've added the -pubkey parameter at creation of the chain

[13-Sep-19 06:28 AM] ca333#0118
Hi @redp1ll - please post your full smartchain launch command.

[13-Sep-19 06:28 AM] ca333#0118
@gcharang ^

[13-Sep-19 06:28 AM] redp1ll#3268
Hi @ca333 , thanks for helping me out here! thats the command I used: ./komodod -ac_name=REDPILL -ac_cc=1 -ac_supply=10000 -testnode=1 -pubkey=02a6aa8b937447729ee4fb046b7c82ad5d585ad521a3c472d99d677fdb08f6a547

[13-Sep-19 06:33 AM] Oszy#5734
do you have a balance on the address?

[13-Sep-19 06:35 AM] redp1ll#3268
yep

[13-Sep-19 06:35 AM] Oszy#5734
Done it this way? 
1)  start the chain without the pubkey parameter
2)  getnewaddress
3)  validateaddress
4) setpubkey

[13-Sep-19 06:36 AM] redp1ll#3268
@Oszy yes exactly, and then I sent 100 coins to the address using sendtoaddress

[13-Sep-19 06:36 AM] redp1ll#3268
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REDPILL getaddressbalance '{"addresses":["RQAZumJVoyTXGKrJHoWJRBCaBunz2tbZHK"]}'
{
  "balance": 10000170000,
  "received": 10000170000
}

[13-Sep-19 06:38 AM] redp1ll#3268
one second I might have used the wrong pubkey

[13-Sep-19 06:38 AM] Oszy#5734
validate RQAZumJVoyTXGKrJHoWJRBCaBunz2tbZHK again

[13-Sep-19 06:39 AM] redp1ll#3268

[13-Sep-19 06:40 AM] Oszy#5734
that is different

[13-Sep-19 06:40 AM] redp1ll#3268
yes, pubkey was wrong

[13-Sep-19 06:40 AM] redp1ll#3268
but I launched it again with the new one and same issue

[13-Sep-19 06:40 AM] redp1ll#3268
/komodod -ac_name=REDPILL -ac_cc=1 -ac_supply=10000 -testnode=1 -pubkey=02e3fde1479d3a6811a53e02cdba88cbb2822e2c3a79ce1ae80d24eb486ce50f37

[13-Sep-19 06:49 AM] ca333#0118
@redp1ll which branch are you using and would it be possible to retest without `-testnode` param and setting `-ac_cc` to > 1 - just curious on the result (`1` should work though since CC active if not mistaken). I personally haven't tested this scenario in test/debug mode with only 1 node (yet). Is your error thrown when calling `tokencreate` or at chain-start?

[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] redp1ll#3268
@ca333  I tried without -testnode and with setting -ac_cc=2. the error is thrown when calling tokencreate:

[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] redp1ll#3268
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REDPILL tokencreate NFT 0.00000001 "test"

[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] redp1ll#3268
that's my return when launching the chain:

[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] redp1ll#3268
./komodod -ac_name=REDPILL -ac_cc=1 -ac_supply=10000 -testnode -pubkey=02e3fde1479d3a6811a53e02cdba88cbb2822e2c3a79ce1ae80d24eb486ce50f37

@dimxy do you know the cause of that error above?

[13-Sep-19 07:09 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, most probably this means there are several privkeys in the wallet and some inputs were added from not mypubkey (-pubkey param of komodod) key.
(this check is against if someone issues a token and puts in the token data a pubkey that he does not own the private key for)

@redp1ll please try sending whole balance to the pubkey stated in the pubkey param and retry please.

[13-Sep-19 07:26 AM] redp1ll#3268
probably the best idea is to just delete the blockchain data and try it with a fresh chain?

@redp1ll once you understand the process of launching a smartchain, you could use this repo for testing the different Antara modules
https://github.com/gcharang/create-smartchain
it automates a lot of things
and you can have 2 daemons running on the same computer behaving like regular nodes

yes it is

[13-Sep-19 10:38 AM] redp1ll#3268

[13-Sep-19 10:39 AM] redp1ll#3268
Setgenerate is set true - 1

[13-Sep-19 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
-1 or 1?

[13-Sep-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
how many peers do you have?

[13-Sep-19 11:43 AM] redp1ll#3268
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  -1 to use maximum available processors

[13-Sep-19 11:43 AM] redp1ll#3268
@jl777c none because I'm running it on -testnode

[13-Sep-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with you being the only miner, 1 should be more than plenty

[13-Sep-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with -1 all you'd do is drive the diff up against yourself

[13-Sep-19 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that doesn't really help you fix that it's not mining, but in the long run

[13-Sep-19 11:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what is your output for `getmininginfo`?

[13-Sep-19 11:48 AM] redp1ll#3268
I understand that makes sense, I'll use 1 then.

`"localsolps": 0`
means that it's literally not mining, so hopefully someone else can help you see why (maybe related to the testnode bits? 🤷🏽 )

[13-Sep-19 12:09 PM] redp1ll#3268
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ok I'll try some other stuff maybe I get it solved. Thanks!

one weird thing is the return on the daemon side:

[13-Sep-19 12:10 PM] redp1ll#3268
`notaryid.-1 Mining.REDPILL with tromp
try REDPILL Mining with tromp`

[13-Sep-19 12:10 PM] redp1ll#3268
is that normal? Because when it did mine the terminal output was a different one

yes, that bit is normal

[13-Sep-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

So I'm having a fresh install of Ubuntu 18 and I want to start the komodo chain

[13-Sep-19 03:21 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I;ve followed your github guide;

[13-Sep-19 03:21 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339

[13-Sep-19 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the build.sh script it gets a "transition error" when trying to connect`
I'm not sure what that means
the build script compiles the program, what do you mean "connect"?

[13-Sep-19 03:26 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
well, I imagine that when the build script starts it tries to download the chain:
it says

[13-Sep-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I feel like the fetch-params.sh script is done way too soon, I mean: I removed everything and it's done in a second? that doesn't make sense to me

[13-Sep-19 03:51 PM] jorian#4555
fetch-params.sh downloads stuff into ~/.zcash-params

[13-Sep-19 03:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it's done in a second? that doesn't make sense to me`
from nothing it wouldn't be that fast if you had fiber to the server

[13-Sep-19 03:57 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@jorian So what ur saying there should be something at /zcash-params

[13-Sep-19 03:57 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 so you agree its wierd, lets see

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
@jorian the folder is full, but I doubt it was removed

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
no, the `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh` command downloads its stuff to a directory outside of the komodo directory. so removing komodo doesn't remove those files. once the params are downloaded, they are downloaded

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
I shall remove it and try agian

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
you don't have to remove that folder

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
they are proving keys for the z part of komodo

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
okay

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
so

[13-Sep-19 03:58 PM] jorian#4555
once there, they don't change

[13-Sep-19 03:59 PM] jorian#4555
i'm building komodo now too, let's see if it fails

[13-Sep-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It will complete instantly if run again after it downloaded the params files (because there's nothing to download if you already have them)

[13-Sep-19 03:59 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
Okay, so It makes sense then. @jorian okay, I shall wait to see what your does

[13-Sep-19 04:00 PM] kamitor - Christiaan#4339
