imo, 'disablecb' should be something like 'forcecb', but that's just me

[16-Mar-19 11:33 AM] gcharang#6833
I think its about perspective
we are telling the daemon to disable the coinbase and treat it like a normal tx
which causes the the pool software to be forced to use the tx given from the blocktemplate

[16-Mar-19 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we are telling the daemon to disable the coinbase`
but, you're not
It's literally the opposite of that

the "disable" is that the *stratum* creation is disabled

[16-Mar-19 11:36 AM] gcharang#6833
without `disablecb`, there is also a `coinbase` array, but with it, that same transaction is added to the txns array, did I understand it all wrong?

[16-Mar-19 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless it's been changed since @blackjok3r initially wrote it, the idea is:
the daemon creates the proper "template"
the stratum uses the template as a literal (rather than the "normal" instance where the stratum creates a custom coinbase tx)
the stratum then must take any "pool fees" out later in the payout

[16-Mar-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what makes it work "for every type"

[16-Mar-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because the cb tx *always* is what the daemon says it is

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its both what you arte saying at the same time 😄

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it remvoes the coinbase from the JSON

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and also does what geinie says

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
does it really matter what its called... it works

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
how do you have a cb if it removes the cb?

[16-Mar-19 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
now I'm lost 😕

[16-Mar-19 11:43 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I'm not seeing how it "remvoes the coinbase from the JSON"
it's literally right there

[16-Mar-19 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@blackjok3r ?

[16-Mar-19 11:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it removes the object called "coinbase"

[16-Mar-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the coinbase is not usualy in the transactions object

[16-Mar-19 11:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it moves it to there

[16-Mar-19 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ok, so what's the fundamental difference of a "coinbasetxn" object, beyond tittle hierarchy (I never noticed the change when we talked about it before)?

[16-Mar-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem was that the knomp (or my understanding of JS) refused to use the tx from that object

[16-Mar-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I used the daemon to stick it into the transactions array

[16-Mar-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so it was parsed through as a nromal transaction

[16-Mar-19 11:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then I disabled the entire code path that builds the coinbase

[16-Mar-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, so this way it works with a "normal" stratum instead of just yours?

[16-Mar-19 11:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so no

[16-Mar-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Really a stratum could use the disablecb logic without a change to the daemon

[16-Mar-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I couldnt get that way to work

[16-Mar-19 11:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once it worked I just left it alone, because tbh I had no idea what I was doing.

[16-Mar-19 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll have to look into it more after I get pirate solo finalized, because I also didn't do anything with it because yours "just worked" so I just pointed folks to it
It seems bits of it might not work in the way I thought they did

[16-Mar-19 12:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, it was an extremly simple solution... becasuse JS sucks and doing it any other way would have not worked.. at least for me. 😆

[16-Mar-19 12:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The way I had read it, your blockTemplate.js just used the daemon template rather than calling transactions.js to create the cb manually; nothing more
I'm glad this came up now, given the work I'll be doing next week already

[16-Mar-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no, because of the merkle calcualtion I think it was, I had to pass the coinbasee into the array of transactions as tx 0 on the daemon side. 
The reqrite the merkle tree function in the stratum

[16-Mar-19 12:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and a few other things to make it not build the coinbase at all.. 
The rest of the changes are realted to rtaking fees, and are all in the paytment processor and were a LOT mor complicated than that

[16-Mar-19 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well I knew the latter, that was always my sticking point with it in theory, but that's still a separate matter 😛

[16-Mar-19 12:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tbh taking the fee was never a priotity but I wanted to amke sure the pool software was backwards compatible with all the config options

[16-Mar-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it "works" in that my ZEX pool hasnt been restarted since I set it up, its still running some extremly old STAKED komodod with billions of prints

[16-Mar-19 12:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😂

[16-Mar-19 12:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I still think the whole thing needs a fresh start and stop using bastardized js from 2014 🤷🏽

[16-Mar-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes plz

[16-Mar-19 12:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed, but who has time for that :troll_cool:

[16-Mar-19 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, I'm already doing a rewrite of the payments for the solo setups, so that "sticking point" is kinda moot for me now

[16-Mar-19 12:36 PM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r 
```md
- There are many features in the Komodo Ecosystem that can make an asset chain's daemon produce non-standard coinbase transactions. Examples include an assetchain parameter that creates new coins for a specified pubkey in every block or a CC module that adds outputs to the coinbase transaction.
- This can be dealt using a mode called `disablecb`
  - Usage: `./komodo-cli getblocktemplate '{"mode":"disablecb"}'`
- The block template produced using this mode doesn't have the `"coinbasetxn": { ... } json object` but adds the coinbase transction to the `"transactions":[ ... ] array` just like a regular transaction.
- Now the pool software can use the `"transactions":[ ... ] array` to create a block and take fees in the payment processor.
```
this is what I am adding to the docs. Any corrections/additions?

[16-Mar-19 01:00 PM] Mylo#8306
what is stratum ELI5 ?

[16-Mar-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Mylo 
Long ago, slush came up with a "middle man" theory for a pool to get the relevant data from the daemon and have the pool decide what work to dole out to workers.
With "stratum" (in theory, at least), not every worker is working with the exact same random variable.
This gives the pool both greater control and, in theory, a greater chance of finding a block.
Core developers loved slush and this new theory so much that the code for giving a miner work directly was entirely stripped out of the code and the "stratum" method became the new way of doing things

[16-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Mylo#8306
like a traffic cop?

[16-Mar-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sort of, yes

[16-Mar-19 01:16 PM] Mylo#8306
a juggling traffic cop

[16-Mar-19 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a "layer" (stratum) between the daemon and the miner

[16-Mar-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts with my recent patch, you can now do `komodod --help` and all asset chain parameters are documented

[16-Mar-19 04:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure if that has hit the `dev` branch yet, but it's on `jl777` branch

hi there just wanted to ask that i f i have negative balance  ? and confirmations -1 ? can i use zapwallettxes ?

[16-Mar-19 05:04 PM] D.rabbani#9094
to overcome the issue ?

[16-Mar-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[16-Mar-19 05:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
conf -1 means it was re-orged

[16-Mar-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not on a staking chain.

[16-Mar-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it cna mean it was orphaned block

[16-Mar-19 05:06 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so will it resolve the issue ?

[16-Mar-19 05:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo i am thinking of stupid-simple thing like http://myhush.org/config-generator/ which generates the CLI command to make a new asset chain

[16-Mar-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its supposed to delete them, but it fails to do it cleanly... so I had to fix it with a startup fix that restors the txns to fix the wallet... and they then forever have confirms = -1

[16-Mar-19 05:07 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes its a POS chain

[16-Mar-19 05:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe I can abuse that code to do what I want

{Reactions}
labs 

[16-Mar-19 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@blackjok3r i was not clear, but I mean "it was re-orged away", which is the same as saying it was orphaned. It could have also been re-orged and stayed in main chain, but then it would not have conf -1. We are agreeing 😃

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Mar-19 05:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so can i carry on with zapwallettxes ?

[16-Mar-19 05:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
can someone please answer me than 😄 i think the block was orphaned as well that is why there is several conf with -1 on it

[16-Mar-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
zapwallet will fix it yes

[16-Mar-19 05:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094

nope it didnt solve

[16-Mar-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
although not much balance on that one

[16-Mar-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but still i wanted to know the reason

[16-Mar-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i think probably its because of the account feature like they have use getaccountaddress "NAme"

[16-Mar-19 05:14 PM] D.rabbani#9094
certain account balances are still in negative

[16-Mar-19 05:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
never use accounts they dont really work

[16-Mar-19 05:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes told them but they didnt listen

[16-Mar-19 05:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is there any solution @blackjok3r  to overcome the issue

[16-Mar-19 05:32 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have tried rescan and zapwallettxes
