sir

[28-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so at least there is a work around

[28-Nov-18 11:52 AM] D.rabbani#9094
yup

[28-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see anything where the setgenerate mode is changed on error... maybe it is due to low memory, not sure. important thing is if the setgenerate true 0 cron will keep things running stable

[28-Nov-18 12:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Mem:           3855         196        3457          39         201        3413
Swap:             0           0           0

[28-Nov-18 12:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
mr @jl777c  memory used is 196 its sstill very low

[28-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, 198 is the amount used?

[28-Nov-18 12:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes

[28-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets hope the cron fix works

[28-Nov-18 12:09 PM] D.rabbani#9094
is there any particular cmmand in linux that i can set cron

[28-Nov-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you edit crontab. google will lead to specific answers

[28-Nov-18 12:11 PM] D.rabbani#9094
Thanks

[28-Nov-18 12:51 PM] D.rabbani#9094
i have set the cron jobs successfully

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
@jl777c  hope it wont affect the chain

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i hope it does!

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
by making it continue to stake blocks

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
okai any conseequences

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] D.rabbani#9094
because i have tried it thrice

[28-Nov-18 12:59 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and its like kick starting the blocks again and again

[28-Nov-18 01:07 PM] D.rabbani#9094
till now witht the cron its working fine the boss hasnt come today

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so i am sorry @jl777c  i couldnt be able to get the details of -ac params

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
but  he will  come tomorrow

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
and i ll ask him

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] D.rabbani#9094
thank you so much for the help

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
important thing is that it is running better now

[28-Nov-18 01:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
yes but i set it up after 10 minutes 😃

[28-Nov-18 01:20 PM] D.rabbani#9094
so hopefully i can see large amount of blocks in the mornig 😃

[28-Nov-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, let me know how it goes

[28-Nov-18 01:22 PM] D.rabbani#9094
oki mr @jl777c  thanks

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
is anyone able to tell me what is needed to support sapling on pools?

[28-Nov-18 02:41 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
and perhaps... help me add support for it

[28-Nov-18 02:42 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
is the changes needed in the actual equihash algo or is it the way a pool creates the blocks?

[28-Nov-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the tx that is changed. there is new pool software to handle this

[28-Nov-18 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
tx version 4

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses a different signing mechanism too

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If you use my pool, nothing matters ... although the payment processr would nede a sapling address isntead of sprout.

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
same as ZEC sapling pool

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still not sure why the pool needs to calcualte the coinbase a second time 🤷

[28-Nov-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
clearly not doing that is far easier and is compatible with everything.

[28-Nov-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if standard rpc is used (createrawtransaction/signrawtransaction) it should make a valid tx

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
well.. I mine KMD on my pool, but I don't think I'll be able to after sapling is enabled.... my software is not nomp or mpos

[28-Nov-18 02:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I changed the ZNOMP to just use the coinabse TX... KMD already has the reiured RPC to get that, if you want help implemnting how to use it DM me.

[28-Nov-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just take the pool fee out in the payment processor

[28-Nov-18 02:48 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
well.. for KMD... right now.... this is what my pool software uses to create the coinbase tx's...

`        else if(strcmp("KMD", coind->symbol) == 0) {
                json_value* cb = json_get_object(json_result, "coinbasetxn");
                if (cb) {
                        json_int_t fee_amount = json_get_int(cb, "fee"); // negative
                        json_int_t value = json_get_int(cb, "coinbasevalue");
                        if (value)
                                available = templ->value = value - fee_amount;
                        else if (!available)
                                available = templ->value = 300000000 - fee_amount; // old wallets
                        coind->reward = (double)(available + fee_amount)/100000000;
                } else {
                        stratumlog("ERROR %s template has no coinbasetxn!\n", coind->symbol);
                }
        }
`

[28-Nov-18 02:49 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
but, it's quite different than the znomp's

[28-Nov-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
how do you create the coinbase tx?

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
https://hastebin.com/adogivoqel

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
OK mine is siply NOT making its own coinabse

[28-Nov-18 02:51 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
then if its KMD, it does the extra stuff above

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its using the daemon, with -pubkey as the pool address

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the coinbase from the daemon is to the pools address

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the just passing ti directly though

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
whatever the daemon says is the block

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it just makes hte blcok that

[28-Nov-18 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then takes its fee out int he payment processor

[28-Nov-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it saves a whole lot of mesing about with javascript and nodjs libs... much KISS

[28-Nov-18 02:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
😃

[28-Nov-18 02:54 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
there's also this for packing the tx for ZEC coins:

`static void job_pack_tx(YAAMP_COIND *coind, char *data, json_int_t amount, char *key)
{
        int ol = strlen(data);
        char evalue[32];

        if(coind->p2sh_address && !key) {
                p2sh_pack_tx(coind, data, amount, coind->script_pubkey);
                return;
        }

        encode_tx_value(evalue, amount);
        sprintf(data+strlen(data), "%s", evalue);

        if(coind->pos && !key)
                sprintf(data+strlen(data), "2321%sac", coind->pubkey);
        else if (key && strcmp(coind->rpcencoding, "ZEC") == 0)
                sprintf(data+strlen(data), "17a914%s87", key);
        else
                sprintf(data+strlen(data), "1976a914%s88ac", key? key: coind->script_pubkey);

        if (!strlen(coind->script_pubkey))
                debuglog("%s error, empty script pubkey!");

//      debuglog("pack tx %s\n", data+ol);
//      debuglog("pack tx %lld\n", amount);
}

[28-Nov-18 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is coinbase, so nothing to sign... maybe it just needs to be tx version 4

[28-Nov-18 02:55 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
yeah I'm not sure TBH... a dev did this integration for me and doen't want any more to do with it :\

[28-Nov-18 02:56 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
I tried testing VOT and my blocks are rejected due to sapling so I know it doesn't work as it is anyway

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you just need to change tx version to 4

[28-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
from 1

@! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers it's js, but https://github.com/VerusCoin/s-nomp might help (as near as I can tell he's got those bits all worked out, albeit you might need to look at the dependencies in package)

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  yeah I've looked over most of the znomp's etc... but mines a different beast :\

[28-Nov-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what I mean is that is the specific offshoot that mike wrote for VRSC and it looks sapling ready
language conversion should be the only issue

[28-Nov-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not like znomp where it's stripped out for just ZCL and ZEC

sapling is not active on KMD yet, should be version 1 until it activates sapling

[28-Nov-18 03:47 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
right, but I'll try and get it working on VOT in the mean time

[28-Nov-18 03:47 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
I'm thinknig this is what is setting the version?

`        char eversion1[32] = "01000000";
        if(coind->txmessage)
                strcpy(eversion1, "02000000");
        
        char script1[4*1024];
`

[28-Nov-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is the first bytes, yes. change it it "04000000"

[28-Nov-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
that might be all that is needed

[28-Nov-18 03:49 PM] ! |🆉🅿🅾🅾🅻.🅲🅰| ! - crackers#9719
will simply add an if condition then and see what happens

[28-Nov-18 04:19 PM] gcharang#6833
I am having trouble with the getblockhashes api of KMD, 
```
$ komodo-cli getblockhashes 1474117241 1474115846
error code: -5
error message:
No information available for block hashes
```

[28-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
is timestampindex=1 set

[28-Nov-18 04:21 PM] gcharang#6833
No. I should set this in .conf and restart the daemon?

[28-Nov-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
from commandline, or i guess .conf, without it there wont be any timestamp data

[28-Nov-18 04:24 PM] gcharang#6833
from commandline while starting the daemon?

[28-Nov-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[28-Nov-18 04:37 PM] gcharang#6833
I've started komodod :`./komodod -timestampindex=1` and blocks are synced. Still getting the same above error

[28-Nov-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
was timestampindex active when the blocks: $ komodo-cli getblockhashes 1474117241 1474115846
 were synced?

[28-Nov-18 04:38 PM] gcharang#6833
I don't think so. How do I make it reindex?
