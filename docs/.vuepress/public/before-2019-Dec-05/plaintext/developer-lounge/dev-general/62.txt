[21-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand the need for stakeguard. I guess it's because I don't fully understand nothing at stake

[21-Nov-18 08:26 AM] Alright#0419
what is the problem with staking on two forks at once?

[21-Nov-18 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
other than not really solving anything, I understand that

[21-Nov-18 08:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright there was a big medium article explaining it, but I don't feel I *really* understand it either. I believe there are edge cases, where you can stake on multiple forks at once, and people who do that "cheat" a bit and have better chances to get staking rewards

[21-Nov-18 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright so the point of stake guard is to punish cheaters, automatically, giving the potentially cheated reward to finder

[21-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
your idea of "cheating" is my idea of "being clever"

[21-Nov-18 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you accidentally stake on multiple nodes, and some go on forks, stake guard can steal yo money

[21-Nov-18 08:29 AM] Alright#0419
does it actually negatively impact the network by doing it?

[21-Nov-18 08:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am not saying i think that is "cheating", but that is how it's described

[21-Nov-18 08:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright depends on how you define things, I guess. In your opinion, it doesn't, but in Miketouts, he probably feels it does.

it's a long article, brace yourself

[21-Nov-18 08:34 AM] ph03nix#3115

[21-Nov-18 08:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh wow, then that same error comes back. Ok, I am not crazy

[21-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
if everyone can do it, is it really cheating?

[21-Nov-18 08:36 AM] ph03nix#3115
no

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] ph03nix#3115
it's referred to as stake guard now

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM builds

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to do build.sh a few times

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then make will build it

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright it's a change to effect a change in game theory essentially. Make it so everybody can automatically find a cheater and get rewarded => no economic incentive to cheat

[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c well i have one fix for you

[21-Nov-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
problem with N@S is that if you start preconditioning future blocks for you to win when you win a block. over time you can end up winning all the blocks. like stake grinding

[21-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
how does N@S allow for that though?

[21-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
Can't you do that anyway?

[21-Nov-18 08:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
more error conditions need to be handled, but it's a start

[21-Nov-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need some help converting something in C to arrays.. eg. :
```static const int STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP1 = 1604211111;
static const int STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP2 = 1604222222;
static const int STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP3 = 1604233333;
static const int STAKED_NOTARIES_TIMESTAMP4 = 1604244444;```

[21-Nov-18 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```extern const char *notaries_STAKED1[][2];
extern int num_notaries_STAKED1;

extern const char *notaries_STAKED2[][2];
extern int num_notaries_STAKED2;

extern const char *notaries_STAKED3[][2];
extern int num_notaries_STAKED3;

extern const char *notaries_STAKED4[][2];
extern int num_notaries_STAKED4;```

[21-Nov-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the first one should be easy but can the second one be like: 
`extern const char *notaries_STAKED[x][][2];`

[21-Nov-18 02:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
```{
    {"blackjok3r", "021914947402d936a89fbdd1b12be49eb894a1568e5e17bb18c8a6cffbd3dc106e" },

[21-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c

[21-Nov-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
*notaries_STAKED[x][][2]

[21-Nov-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
what is x?

[21-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
multiple of the last quoted peice

[21-Nov-18 02:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181

{
    {"blackjok3r", "021914947402d936a89fbdd1b12be49eb894a1568e5e17bb18c8a6cffbd3dc106e" },

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant have two levels of [][]

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
no way to know the size

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ˜¦

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they are a constant

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so the size is known

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but [4][][2] is not knowable in size

[21-Nov-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure that will work

[21-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
is the actual size then:
`extern const char *notaries_STAKED1[(sizeof(notaries_STAKED1)/sizeof(*notaries_STAKED1][2]`

[21-Nov-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
more imprtantly what is the size of thethe first part of  [][2] saying?

[21-Nov-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
[][2] is saying is it a pointer to an array of 2 element arrays

[21-Nov-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I understand the [2] however I dont get what the [] means ... is there another way to define that char* array wher it can have multiple elements?

[21-Nov-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
extern const char *notaries_STAKED1[(sizeof(notaries_STAKED1)/sizeof(*notaries_STAKED1][2]
you cant refer to yourself to get the size, that should be an error

[21-Nov-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
lets take a step back. what are you trying to do?

[21-Nov-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes that was a copy paste... the extern s a diff file .. they are defined with the aray then that math under it as the number as a global constant

[21-Nov-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to take the costant array of char* that defines the notary nodes... and put them in to an array of each "era" because for staked, its every 2 months

[21-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and defining each array adds loads of code that seems like it shold not be there

[21-Nov-18 03:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its should all be loops in arrays

[21-Nov-18 03:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
eg.```int8_t StakedNotaryID(std::string &notaryname, char *Raddress) {
  int8_t notaryID = -1;
    if ( STAKED_ERA != 0 ) {
      switch (STAKED_ERA) {
        case 1:
          notaryID = ScanStakedArray(notaries_STAKED1,num_notaries_STAKED1,Raddress,notaryname);
          break;
        case 2:
          notaryID = ScanStakedArray(notaries_STAKED2,num_notaries_STAKED2,Raddress,notaryname);
          break;
        case 3:
          notaryID = ScanStakedArray(notaries_STAKED3,num_notaries_STAKED3,Raddress,notaryname);
          break;
        case 4:
          notaryID = ScanStakedArray(notaries_STAKED4,num_notaries_STAKED4,Raddress,notaryname);
          break;
      }
    }
    return(notaryID);
}```

[21-Nov-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it has to do something like that. seems ok

[21-Nov-18 03:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what if.... each constant like:
```{
    {"blackjok3r", "021914947402d936a89fbdd1b12be49eb894a1568e5e17bb18c8a6cffbd3dc106e" }, 
    {"alright", "0285657c689b903218c97f5f10fe1d10ace2ed6595112d9017f54fb42ea1c1dda8" },
}```
was a structure... nad I made an array of those?

[21-Nov-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
alternative is to make it parse contents from a file, but maybe that is not secure for notary list

[21-Nov-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you can make a structure out of each notary entry and then each era would have a vector of the structure

[21-Nov-18 03:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
perfect ... that seems to solve the issue

[21-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
because its C++ with boost ... having them as a vector  is really easy

[21-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ðŸ¤”

[21-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the notary nodes should be an object

[21-Nov-18 03:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
notaries.getera()

[21-Nov-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it works, doesnt seem to matter how exactly it is done

[21-Nov-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but if it works easier

[21-Nov-18 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then you can do more

[21-Nov-18 03:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm starting to wrap my head around the state... and where you can get things at some time ... mostly because of how many issues I ad with the streamer getting the queue working... and it seems there are ways... maybe we should just make artem city rewrite BTC in rust lol

[21-Nov-18 03:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
