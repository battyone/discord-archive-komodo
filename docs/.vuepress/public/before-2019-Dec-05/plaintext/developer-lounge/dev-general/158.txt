I think there was something like that in jumblr

[26-Mar-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 could you shed some light on how agama GUI wallet generates the new bip39 seed phrase, for a new wallet?

[26-Mar-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think Decker has a script that does this

[26-Mar-19 09:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
it used a seed and than added 1
2
3
etc to get different destination addresses

[26-Mar-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
I thought maybe this script had seed phrase stuff but it does not seem to: https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/genkomodo.php

[26-Mar-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's already part of Agama and KMD stuff

[26-Mar-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am using the debug tools to see what agama does to generate this stuff

[26-Mar-19 09:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, no web api requests, which makes sense. there is no web api for this, it must be doing something else to get the data

[26-Mar-19 09:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
agama *does* allow custom WIF (which I call a seed phrase)

[26-Mar-19 09:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
WIF I thought only meant the base58 representation of a private key, but all these terms have fluid meanings

[26-Mar-19 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
clicking the "custom seed phrase" button on and off gives me a new seed phrase instantly every time in the GUI

[26-Mar-19 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I just want to have that on the CLI

[26-Mar-19 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
"custom wallet seed" is what Agama GUI calls it

[26-Mar-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
sha256(origseed + %d)

[26-Mar-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
knowing any specific sha256 value wont let you calculate any other. the origseed of course is critical and generates all the privkeys

[26-Mar-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
replace sha256 with whatever other crypto strength hashing, you can also make origseed composed out of multiple parts, each of them hashes

[26-Mar-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
just depends on how far you want to go

[26-Mar-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
I had one idea where you made a single passphrase and then randomly flipped bits in it. then you dont directly know where the coins are, but given the origseed you are able to mine them

[26-Mar-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so put a small amount in the direct address from the original seed and the rest in the mineable addresses

[26-Mar-19 09:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
I like it. Sounds kind of like giving yourself a map and burying treasure

[26-Mar-19 09:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
thanks for the mention @dukeleto
if invoice cc is not required urgently i'd love to try my hand at it.. i'm recapping my c/c++ for now, but i'll be full time on kmd & pirate sometime after the nn election 
finally leaving the corp world to do something useful 🤞

[26-Mar-19 09:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch invoice CC might be a good stepping stone to the vault CC which my gut tells me could have more moving parts, but who knows. Both are very interesting

[26-Mar-19 09:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
from the spec i read for vaults, they're proposing a new primitive called covenants 😬 

it all depends on what deadlines are expected by the community, but as i said, i'll have plenty of time shortly 😁

[26-Mar-19 09:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 i am seeing `window.state.randomSeed` which stores the output of the latest generated wallet seed

[26-Mar-19 09:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch keep things simpler than you think you need to, is my life motto

[26-Mar-19 09:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
because life has a way of exponentially making things more complex in ways we never can imagine

[26-Mar-19 09:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's my model as well.. there's never a need to over complicate things
more study is required from my behalf tho

[26-Mar-19 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 ` randomSeed: passphraseGenerator.generatePassPhrase(256)` might be what i am looking for

[26-Mar-19 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
i feel dirty when i crawl thru nodeJS codebases searching for what I need

[26-Mar-19 09:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it's still better than Java

[26-Mar-19 09:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
`import passphraseGenerator from 'agama-wallet-lib/src/crypto/passphrasegenerator';`

```the above GUI needed no RPC changes at all in ZEC, I don't think
it's purely a GUI wallet feature```
@dukeleto unless they've changed something there is not such thing, that hideous thing with the heart on it is a layer app

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 your lib is a very tiny wrapper around bip39.js, i see now

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] pbca26#5430
@dukeleto all you need is bip39

[26-Mar-19 09:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 no comprendo

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@pbca26 i see now that the bip39.c link you gave is pretty nice standalone way to do it from the CLI

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
at least now I understand more about how the sausage is made

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Zec's QT wallet is pure RPC, it's not like Ocean where the daemon is part of it

[26-Mar-19 09:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
agreed

[26-Mar-19 09:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
payment requests are purely a GUI feature, which use memo fields in nice ways

[26-Mar-19 09:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
they are kind of like super simple one-time use HushLists, where there is a message that says "pay me" and you might pay them. It's just nice to see the memo field actually being used

[26-Mar-19 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but that's what I'm saying, it can't be "purely a GUI feature", because their GUI makes RPC calls; whatever you can send through that GUI, you can send cli

[26-Mar-19 09:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think we are just confusing each other with terminology

[26-Mar-19 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[26-Mar-19 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
what I mean to say, is that the wallet is customizing the full node, changing RPCs, adding RPCs, etc.. It just uses the RPC interface

[26-Mar-19 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
Hush is looking for a new wallet to fork for GUI stuff, and KomodoOcean and Zec Wallet are the 2 current contenders

[26-Mar-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
to me, that which is "purely a GUI feature" is something that you can do in the GUI and cannot duplicate with `zcash-cli.....`

[26-Mar-19 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
that doesn't exist, all features must boil down to cli or RPC calls, which are isomorphic

[26-Mar-19 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
i mean to say, it's "purely *implemented* in the GUI"

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
no implementation in internals

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
no full node implementation

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
no C/C++ implementation

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
purely in the GUI

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that doesn't exist, all features must boil down to cli or RPC calls,`correct, that's what I was saying 😛

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
words are confusing

[26-Mar-19 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
let's just use math

[26-Mar-19 09:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
nodeJS wallets look cool, but the security issues really do concern me. I don't think I want to maintain the hush-ng nodeJS codebase and I want switch to a QT+RPC codebase. So I am looking at all my options, and making my upstream something that is funded by Zcash foundation doesn't sound like a horrible idea

[26-Mar-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch there is no rush for invoice CC, until just now, didnt even have it on the actively developed list. before you start in on it, make sure it has some cool features, like automatic payments to authorized invoicers (up to a cap per time period)

[26-Mar-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, it can be used to authorize payments of monthly bills and the burden of invoicing and collecting is on the billings side. which means the biller would need to be able to create the transaction

[26-Mar-19 06:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
trezor-crypto and libsodium does all the heavy lifting, but it taught me some good stuff

[26-Mar-19 06:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i was getting RNG data incorrectly and my seed phrases, every one, had the word abandon 4 times in them, and always started with a word that started with `sc`, weird stuff like that. Taught me a lesson. If I hadn't generated a bunch of seed phrases and looked at them, it would have looked like a "random" seed, but it had a very definite pattern because of my bug
