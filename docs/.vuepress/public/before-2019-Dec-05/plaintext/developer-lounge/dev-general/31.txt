This tag is Linux, but the title is osx.

[02-Oct-18 12:32 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723
It's okay if it's not a build source. Only the daemon should work. Does Agama include it?

[02-Oct-18 12:33 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
yes, Agama install downloads the latest stable prebuilts

[02-Oct-18 12:36 AM] Kyung-Nam Park#1723
I should have said it in advance. I want the official version to be recognized by the Foundation operating on the centos command line.

From the perspective of this being #dev-general, shouldn't folks be building from the https://github.com/jl777/komodo repo?

Hey guys, I'm really new to blockchain dev and working on a project to claim kmd interest using bitcore lib.  My question is pretty simple, functionally can I claim interest if I specify the address and change address, correct fee, etc?  Or is there a particular procedure that needs to be followed to claim interest?

[02-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
I'm looking through the js files for Agama-Web as reference but wanted to see if anyone here has a quick answer

[02-Oct-18 09:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
if i'm not mistaken you need to set the nlocktime in the past so time -777 to accept it in the next block

[03-Oct-18 12:30 AM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
@CHMEX I'm referring to collecting the interest.

[03-Oct-18 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
just spend the utxo. (sum of vins + interest) - (sum of outputs) -> is the txfee

[03-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Oliver Westbrook#7752
Ah, ok.  Thank you @jl777c

a bob node requires native clients of both coins? can't have one on electrum ?

[03-Oct-18 01:59 PM] qmc#4355
or am I missing something

[03-Oct-18 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
electrum is not recommended to use for bob node

[03-Oct-18 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
it will most likely have issues

[03-Oct-18 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
native mode is best for bob nodes

Hey @ca333 Just wondering if we can integrate all repos into KomodoPlatform repo? Or what may be the reason we don't? I was talking with SHossain about updating some aspects of the Komodo Platform Github to better represent the work that is being done. It seems I often spend time dealing with FUD about lack of developer activity due to the insights feature on Github. So things like the scaling stuff, mm2.0, cryptoconditions, etc. SHossain just added the links to these to the "Source of all KomodoPlatform Repositories and Releases" but this doesn't change the "insights" results which often people perform cursory checks on to see if a project is inactive. Thanks.

[03-Oct-18 04:27 PM] qmc#4355
Is there a way for our users to select an alternative config path in native mode ?

which part? There is an iguana program that makes the notarisations, and there is a funciton in ConnectBlock that validates them in komodod itself.
