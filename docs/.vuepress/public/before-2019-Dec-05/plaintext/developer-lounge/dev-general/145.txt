no, each user only controls their own node. you can't cause someone else to fork.

[22-Mar-19 07:57 PM] zack#6467
you can only choose which fork your own node should follow.

[22-Mar-19 07:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But komodo is lying? Lol

[22-Mar-19 07:58 PM] Alright#0419
follow the fork with a lie or your coins become worthless because you can't trade them

I think futarchy markets are probably the absolute optimal tool for deciding on hard updates.
They are perfect for communities to come to decisions.

[22-Mar-19 07:58 PM] MyName#0491
you underestimate the ability to create decision trees that will confound the nodes

[22-Mar-19 07:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like you have an obssesion with deciding who is a liar :troll_thuglife:

[22-Mar-19 07:59 PM] zack#6467
Prediction markets are the best known mechanism for detecting lies, so in a way you are very right.

This is one of my favorite documents about the potential of prediction markets. page 2 talks about lie detecting.

[22-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Regnar#6164
I still think there is a big disconnect here on what an oracle actually is. Ironically enough Zack claiming Komodo is lying (about something?) means we all should have been in agreement to what Zack's definition of Oracle is, making him the "Oracle" of it's definition. Which doesn't seem to be the case. As defined by Komodo's actual documents
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/all_chapters.md#chapter-11---oracles-example>
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-oracles.html#introduction> 

The definition is simply ```"Just what is an oracle? In this context it is something that puts data that is not on the blockchain, onto the blockchain."```
Zack I believe said that an Oracle MUST be trustless?

[22-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Regnar#6164
But by Komodo definition the data doesn't have to be anything, except data that wasn't on the blockchain prior

If you are obssessed with detecting liars you are failing miserably right now

If I made a blockchain to compete with ethereum, and it has smart contracts, but all the smart contracts were trustful, and I didn't warn any of the users that the contracts were all trustful, I would consider that a scam. Wouldn't you also consider that a scam?

Because with blockchain projects, everything is supposed to be trustless, and you need to warn people when you use trust.
It isn't logical to have trust on-chain, because a blockchain is expensive and the only benefit it gives is trustlessness.

[22-Mar-19 08:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[22-Mar-19 08:08 PM] MyName#0491
Well, to start with you're starting with the flawed assumption that ethereum matters or is "competition"

[22-Mar-19 08:09 PM] Alright#0419
Could I have an invite link to your discord? I need to warn them about something

[22-Mar-19 08:09 PM] MyName#0491
After that, you have the flawed assumption that the world is in a trustless state unless otherwise stated

[22-Mar-19 08:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) blockchains don‚Äôt have to be expensive 2) trustlessness is not a necessary requirement for oracles and not the only reason to use a blockchain. 3)  the fact that permissioned chains exist disproves everything supposed to be trustless

[22-Mar-19 08:10 PM] Regnar#6164
```The most difficult issue about oracles is that they need to be trusted to various degree to provide accurate and timely data. The danger is that if a trusted node is used to write data to the blockchain, it creates a trust point and a single point of attack. Ultimately there is nothing that can ensure only valid data is written to the blockchain, so what is done is to reinforce good behavior via pay per datapoint. However, for critical data, higher level processing is needed that combines multiple data providers into a validated signal.```

What unicorn told you this?

[22-Mar-19 08:12 PM] zack#6467
Cryptoeconomics combines game theory and cryptographic protocols so that you can have mathematical guarantees about the reliability of your protocol. This is what is meant by "trustless" or "secure".

Who is the centralized "authority" that you feel defines "Cryptoeconomics "?

[22-Mar-19 08:14 PM] zack#6467
Who is the central authority that says for right triangles A*A + B*B = C*C ?

I am not sure. Asking why math is the way it is, that is a philosophical question.

[22-Mar-19 08:15 PM] zack#6467
A religious person might say that God built math that way

[22-Mar-19 08:15 PM] zack#6467
It is great that we have mathematical tools to know if a bridge will collapse, or if a protocol will be secure.

Introduction toCryptoeconomics
What is cryptoeconomics?
Cryptoeconomics is about...
‚óèBuilding systems that have certain desired properties
‚óèUse cryptography to prove properties about messages that happened in the past
‚óèUse economic incentives defined inside the system to encourage desired properties to hold into the future```
Where is the word "trustless" (or even the implication of it) in that

@zack I haven't read it all, but I think you ask good questions and I think it's very good to get asked hard questions by people outside of our own echo chamber

[22-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Regnar#6164
You do realize game theory isn't trustless right? Nor is game theory a mathematical certainty. It's a way to measure/layout incentives of rational participants who's incentive is in the outcome of the game itself. Game theory doesn't account for those participants whose incentive is derived outside said game, or in the failure of the game itself, or are simply irrational actors.

[22-Mar-19 08:19 PM] zack#6467
Sounds like Vitalik likes to use different jargon from me. I haven't talked to him in like 3 years, so it isn't so surprising that we talk differently.

That being the 10th or 12th time he's written "Nash equilibrium", I'm confident in saying "No, he doesn't"

[22-Mar-19 08:20 PM] zack#6467
game theory is sort of the reverse of mechanism design.
With game theory you are trying to find the best strategy for an existing game.
With mechanism design you are trying to create a game such that the best strategy is your goal.

[22-Mar-19 08:21 PM] zack#6467
I don't know what it means to say "game theory is trustless".
Game theory is math, which is a collection of algorithms. 
"trustless" is a word you  use to describe if a protocol has certain properties.

[22-Mar-19 08:23 PM] Regnar#6164
Game theory is measuring incentives for rational players, most often measured with some basic math. That means nothing in context of what you said earlier ```Cryptoeconomics combines game theory and cryptographic protocols so that you can have mathematical guarantees about the reliability of your protocol. This is what is meant by "trustless" or "secure".```

[22-Mar-19 08:24 PM] MyName#0491
fwiw, "Nash equilibrium" goes out the window when your centralized platform can issue a "hard update" because someone paid you to determine that some oracleX is "about to lie"

[22-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Regnar#6164
Game theory doesn't make anything "secure" or "trustless" it just gives us better ideas of how participants would play the game, assuming their motives and incentives are primarily derived from playing the game.

[22-Mar-19 08:25 PM] zack#6467
game theory doesn't do anything. it is a field of math.

[22-Mar-19 08:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
People being able to get you to make an update could be considered part of game theory.

[22-Mar-19 08:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
*What are the chances costs inputs needed to get Zack to do what I want?*

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That has nothing to do with math in reality.

[22-Mar-19 08:26 PM] MyName#0491
`People being able to get you to make an update could be considered part of game theory.`
And one which factually nullifies "Nash equilibrium" by forcing some actions to no longer be possible

[22-Mar-19 08:27 PM] zack#6467
The  nash equilibrium is that no one will ever try to make Amoveo lie. because they would lose a ton of money, and fail.
So I will never have to do a hard update to prevent an oracle from lying.

[22-Mar-19 08:27 PM] benohanlon#1119
but you are relying on people being able to spot a lie @zack?

[22-Mar-19 08:27 PM] benohanlon#1119

[22-Mar-19 08:28 PM] zack#6467
If someone is making a bet in an oracle, then the outcome of the oracle will cause them to gain or lose money, so they have an influence to keep an eye on it and complain if it looks like it isn't working correctly.

That's literally not true

I pay you "tens of thousands of dollars" to consider "grass is green" to be a lie
You "hard update" to refuse to accept that "grass is green"
I make $900k+
I achieve my optimal outcome

[22-Mar-19 08:33 PM] MyName#0491

[22-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Regnar#6164
zack, what is your definition of Oracle?

[22-Mar-19 08:35 PM] zack#6467
An oracle is a source of information that can't be calculated from a pure function.

[22-Mar-19 08:35 PM] zack#6467
for 2+2 you don't need an oracle, it is a pure function. but "did Trump win the election", you do need an oracle.

[22-Mar-19 08:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
"pure function" has a precise meaning for some people that might not realize

[22-Mar-19 08:36 PM] MyName#0491
`but "did Trump win the election", you do need an oracle`
errr 'is x > y' is a "pure function"

[22-Mar-19 08:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
```
In computer programming, a pure function is a function that has the following properties:[1][2]

Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices).
Its evaluation has no side effects (no mutation of local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or I/O streams).
```

[22-Mar-19 08:37 PM] zack#6467

[22-Mar-19 08:38 PM] zack#6467
Advertising something as trust-free when it is trustful  is a lie.

[22-Mar-19 08:38 PM] zack#6467
@Regnar  you can ask the Amoveo oracle to find out

[22-Mar-19 08:38 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[22-Mar-19 08:42 PM] zack#6467
You guys are fixating on the definition of the word oracle.
I think that jl777c and I agree on the definition.

The problem is that Komodo is leaving a strong impression that they built a trustless oracle with their advertising, they aren't doing anything to alert the investors that it is actually a trusted oracle.

[22-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Alright#0419
Are you?

[22-Mar-19 08:42 PM] zack#6467
My definition of "smart contract" isn't trustless either.
 But if I talk about "blockchain smart contracts", by default it is trustless. I would need to specify if it is not.

[22-Mar-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a prominent paragraph that explains it clearly for people that dont realize to have an individual publisher means you are getting data from that individual publisher

[22-Mar-19 08:43 PM] zack#6467
what paragraph? Maybe  I misread something?

`You guys are fixating on the definition of the word oracle.`
