Hi, could someone please explain interoperability in the context of this channel?

[03-Oct-18 07:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Anything to do with clusters?

[03-Oct-18 07:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think it's a new tech to be announced, recently there was an image posted in marketing with an obvious spoiler

[03-Oct-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ETH was being notarised to KMD... maybe that something... but thats anoher libscott project so I guess we are waiting for him to come back on that one too, my eth notarizer stopped working on latest update.

[03-Oct-18 07:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
The spoiler was "Interchain bridges" or something similar, prob interoperability w non-KMD based blockchains

Ahh, ETH-bridge, thanks!

Once ive figure out how to get my custom inflation algo into a kmd asset-chain, ill be spending 90% of my time here

[12-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Mylo#8306
@Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com use crypto-conditions.   Send the block reward to a crypto condition address then you can do your DoI-SMS thing at any stage.   There’s a response back in the pioneers discord

[14-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I feel a bit foolish leaving the server then. I had no idea someone had replied.

[14-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
@Mylo im in the process of moving interstate. Workstation is packed away already.

[14-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
Ill be back to work in a fortnight... long drive ahead of me

[14-Oct-18 08:45 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
Ive almost been able to reboot peercoin with a very long 'else if' for the inflation model.

[14-Oct-18 08:46 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I have shortlist of codebases i want to test this on. Thing is i dont know any about coding outside of using tutorials and stackoverflow to break my way to something functioning.

[14-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I know its very simple stuff doing it. Ive gone through the code for countless coins. A few use else ifs. Anyway... ive got too many ideas and no one to help ke develop them.

[14-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
The idea of launching zerozed was to somehow self finance and prove the model at the same time

[14-Oct-18 08:48 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
All ive done is ended up been evicted and about 10 grand in debt

[14-Oct-18 08:50 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
Anyways. Ill be back in a couple of weeks to continue on. Peter bushnel of ftc is rebase me to bitcoin abc pretty soon and at that point ill have time to spend on these 2 other coins and the kmd asset chain

[14-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Mylo#8306
@Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com all good man.  but yes, don't be so hasty in leaving after posting useful info - ya never know when ppl will respond.   the google doc much more useful for my reading than the medium post (less reading, straight to details).

OK - what crypto conditions (CC) allows you to do is make custom consensus.  so in the case of DoI-SMS, mine to a CC address (a "smart contract" but more powerful because of it's capabilities) and then redistribute based on whatever algorithm you use.

Perhaps the best way to move foward at the moment is:
 - pick any programming language
 - simulate the distribution in a loop (e.g. for loop, while etc.)
 - print out the stats to a file (e.g. csv or json)
 - have a pretty graphs (either using excel, d3 or plotly) to show what actually happens
 - be able to modify the parameters in the loop

This exercise will give you uncomplicated programming practise.

When another programmer can see what is going on, to port it to say C++ would be much easier to collaborate than to try and implement it from just a whitepaper of sorts.

Collaboration is key and so is looking after yourself.   We are all in it for the long game, the debt is just a number - as long as it is managed.  If management of that to you is paying it all out over 3-6 months - great.   If it's a 5 year loan at $50/month, cool.

All the best in the drive etc.

Hmmmm I wonder if you are deleted user Calem, cannot mention you.
I remember jl777 saying that the different block reward eras could make and approximate curve.
Verus coin had an interesting launch and block rewards locking feature for the early miners.  Currently BR are 24 and not locked.

I’m not sure the block reward is the place for your DoI-SMS tbh.  Using a crypto condition, it would be able to lock block rewards and redistribute them according to anything you want, over time in portions to the miner, or according to off-chain data oracle-ized shared out (again over time and also cumulatively recalculate this period) like mining pool shares, to spread the distribution or “water down” the concentration of high payout BR to early miners.
```

[14-Oct-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
changing blockreward is easily done by making changes to the blockreward function. no need for any complex CC

[14-Oct-18 11:15 AM] Mylo#8306
I think i read DoI-SMS in the context of the BR being shared out, and my thoughts went to the infographic competition - where some of the prize money (5x100KMD) went to other ppl.  So in the case of miners with BR, they can be diffused to other parties involved.   Maybe i am complicating it.

Watching that recent yt upload. Reminded me to mention that the inflation model i want to test as an asset chain, id like to have it as proof of stake as it seems that should be possible.

[14-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Mylo#8306
Interesting, I don’t do any cpp stuff atm but see how things go for the rest of the month in codebase exploration

[11-Dec-18 12:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@libscott @jl777c 
```UniValue crosschainproof(const UniValue& params, bool fHelp)
{
    UniValue ret(UniValue::VOBJ);
    //fprintf(stderr,"crosschainproof needs to be implemented\n");
    return(ret);
}
```
Whats the status on this?
I am assuming this is the RPC I would need to use to verify a tx from another chain on a chain? Say a list of notarisation txids is sent to an oracle, I can use this RPC to make sure that each notarisation actually happened?

[11-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to make a very basic cross chain contract..

[11-Dec-18 12:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But the functionality seems not implemented.

[11-Dec-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
I noticed that too. not sure its status nor its intended usage

[11-Dec-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
in gateways CC I do a cross chain proof using the existing rpc calls

[11-Dec-18 09:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ah ok cool. I will look at gateways as an example then. Thanks 😃

That's why it's a "hard fork", sometimes you simply can't add things without changing the "old" things

Does anyone in here know InternetOf coins? They have a multicurrency wallet with crosschainfunction. It's OpenSource and Komodo should be now problem to include they said. As I am no Dev by myself maybe one of you might have a look at it? Could be another KMD wallet in future? https://internetofcoins.org/blog/multi-ledger-api-live

that's pretty cool

[10-Mar-19 03:40 PM] Mylo#8306
interesting.   
https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-cakeshop if it were updated more often connects to all KMD assetchains, BTC protocol coins.   It's a bit dumb, but could be one part of a solution hybrix offers (if it supported eth + waves etc.)

Hi I am an active member of Zclassic Community, 

I am looking for a solution to use Callisto-Network Smart-Contracts from our Blockchain to design an Hybrid-Ecosystem around or main core. I designed a solution including a Side-chain connected with the Atomic-swaps but I would like to check the feasibility of the project I designed.

[09-Aug-19 02:47 PM] lelonex#7376
Who's can help me to study the possibility to use Komodo interoperability to achieve the goal?

[09-Aug-19 02:52 PM] lelonex#7376
ps.: I am mainly interested to understand the possibility to convert the token/info in both direction Zclassic <[Komodo]> Callisto

[09-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it callisto supports CLTV opcode, it should work with atomicDEX, but i remember one of the zclassic type of coins changed all their vouts to need some strange extra data. if ZCL is one of those it is nonstandard and would require a special handling

[09-Aug-19 02:55 PM] lelonex#7376
@jl777c it is similar Zcash, we share the same code

[09-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then it should just work

[09-Aug-19 02:58 PM] lelonex#7376
we need to write a slice of system to evolve community in developement partecipation without changing the main purpose of the chain: keeping Zclassic 100% community driven

[10-Aug-19 10:41 AM] lelonex#7376
@jl777c what kind of info a swap can share between blockchain to have a full interoperability? Is it possible to interact to a Smart-contract of a specific foreign blockchain? 

ex. If I would like to interact with Callisto ChainLink hub from Zclassic.. can I use Atomic-Swaps as a "proxy" to route disposal to a specific contract on the foreign blockchain?

[10-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
probablly not. atomicDEX is designed to do cross chain swaps of coins

I thought Zclassic was just a zcash fork?

[10-Aug-19 10:48 AM] lelonex#7376
yes, It is

[10-Aug-19 10:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Silly question but what do you use the smart contract for? Why not just use komodo CC on a new chain that you migrate to?

[10-Aug-19 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You could then get dPoW and once james finishes his mining diff algo, you would not get diff stranded any more

[10-Aug-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_adaptivepow is in beta testing now. arguably the best DAA

[10-Aug-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
single CPU can unstrand a chain from any level of diff stranding

[10-Aug-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
massive hashrate increase only gets 3 or 4 blocks before being stopped with diff adjustment that can 600x each block

[10-Aug-19 11:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The DAA improvements will bring in more smaller coin communities that need it 😃

[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] lelonex#7376
we have an improvement about 51% attack reduction. we are testing it. we got an implementation about 2 weeks ago 😃 

my question is about  interoperability and the ability to access to Smart-contacts system using a mediator
