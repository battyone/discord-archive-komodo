Idk about that,   The consequences of the crack epidemic are still fresh

[21-Aug-19 05:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Cannabis makes sense,  low addiction rate, low criminality rate,  not a cheaper way to analogue its medicinal properties,   Defined waste product repurposing.   Cocaine is pretty much the opposite.

[21-Aug-19 06:06 PM] PTYX#6840
There's no medical use cases for cocaine hydrochloride from what i understand.

[21-Aug-19 06:07 PM] PTYX#6840
They have medical use cases for variations of cocaine that are analgesics but it's completely different than the stuff peope buy in the streets. The coicane leaf by itself is an analgesic without being processed.

[21-Aug-19 06:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
2 things I can think of medically .   Dopamine production and analgesic.  And we have L-dopa ( for Parkinson‚Äôs disease ) and novacaine

Procaine and whole slew of Caine ‚Äòs

[21-Aug-19 06:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Novocaine isn't related to cocaine

[21-Aug-19 06:12 PM] PTYX#6840
And neither is lidocaine.

[21-Aug-19 06:13 PM] PTYX#6840
Other than they end in -cain and people automatically relate it to cocaine. Back in the day cocaine was definitely used in tons of medicine but not anymore

[21-Aug-19 06:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Not sure about dopamine. I guess adrenalin would be just as good

[21-Aug-19 06:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Similar chemical structure

[21-Aug-19 06:16 PM] PTYX#6840
Similar, but doesn't come from the plant at all

[21-Aug-19 06:16 PM] PTYX#6840
So in theory, there's no medical use cases for powder cocaine

[21-Aug-19 06:17 PM] PTYX#6840
I somewhat agree with making drugs legal and investing in education / rehab / prevention

[21-Aug-19 06:17 PM] PTYX#6840
But it's also my position that all drugs shouldn't be legal
