@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ Oh really? I have a different point of view. I think traditional service is bad, high cost and lack of efficiency. That's why when using blockchain, we could reduce the cost, save time to find your doctor. It can create a digital ID card to store our information. I see many good usages with Solve.care .

[04-Nov-18 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Liz If you think that anything short of regulation on actual healthcare (and/or the removal of insurance entirely) is going to lower healthcare costs, then you're either delusional or lack understanding of how corporations work

[04-Nov-18 03:48 AM] Liz#1610
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  I'm sorry if I got limited knowledge. So insurance is something that we can't change, right?

They signed a contract with Arizona Care Network, so their project not a concept any more but actually worked ü§î

is software now more secure so that hackers started to explore CPUs ?

[05-Nov-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181

interesting interview with one of the first people to read Satoshi wp

"I have figured out how to redesign the cryptographically secured history database built by cryptocurrencies so that you don‚Äôt need any full nodes.  There are other ways to organize the blocks that give the proof property you need; They don‚Äôt have to form something that‚Äôs only a chain, and you don‚Äôt have to have specialized nodes for the purpose of holding them because everybody can hold just the blocks they need to show the validity of their own txOuts"

"Call it a ‚ÄúBlock Hyperchain‚Äù, by reference to the N-dimensional hypercube it‚Äôs based on and the block chain it replaces."

The first direct observation of gravitational waves captured the merging of 2 black holes which emitted 3.6 septillion yottawatts of power (3.6√ó10‚Å¥‚Å∂ watts), greater than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe https://t.co/...
