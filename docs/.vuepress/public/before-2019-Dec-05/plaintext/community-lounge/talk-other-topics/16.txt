Mobile payments are somehow related to consumption as a result of domestic growth.
Fintech usually grows faster in areas where financial infrastructure development is lagging.
As if
In Africa, where the wireline infrastructure wasn't working,
It's like going straight to your cell phone.
Rather than a retail banking institution,
Wouldn't he have thought that Fintech could grow more stable?
in the result
Before the credit card infrastructure grew,
Skip it.
It seems that it is moving directly to mobile payment infrastructures.
