The Ocean Cleanup suspended as device breaks down in Pacific Ocean
A fracture in The Ocean Cleanup's "giant Pac Man", dispatched to scoop up waste from the Pacific Ocean, has forced the company to abort the mission and haul the apparatus back to shore.

Innovation and expansion of global supply chain network centering on smart contracts and smartcontracts using the integrity of the blockchain are expected to become reality in the near future. However, in order for the emergence of new technology to be incorporated into reality, it must be combined with the overall structural change of the ecosystem. Changing ecosystems is difficult to achieve with just one industry change. Complex changes in various industries require the role of facilitators, not just technology. The role of small but innovative start-ups that pursue change in adventurous thinking is meaningful as a facilitator, but it can not ignore the effects of some multinational corporations, which in itself form an ecosystem, from choosing new technologies.

There was an early assertion that handheld computers would become popular. But start-ups that led to handheld computers have disappeared as quickly as expected. Their innovative ideas and technologies alone could not make consumers carry a handheld computer. It is a fruitful result of a multinational corporation who wanted to buy a big computer and a big computer that led the innovation of battery material. Since Apple and Samsung have made an enterprise-wide effort, citizens around the world have embraced handheld computers, called smartphones, as a component of their lives.

[08-Jan-19 05:12 AM] designer#4893
It could eventually be up to some multinational companies to extend the blockchain and smartcontacts beyond the digital boundaries. Applying Ronald Course's logic, which provides insight into transaction costs and the company's presence, multinational firms have emerged as a solution to the distrust caused by today's global supply chain, which has to cross multiple borders. Although the development of the blockchain could lead to the dissolution of multinational corporations, the conclusion of the logic that the block chain should be chosen by multinational companies before it penetrates the lives of global villagers was a vicious paradox that blockchain advocates cannot think of.

"Decentralization" is a term that is thrown about like jelly beans in crypto. Nothing can be "decentralized" enough for purists and yet the same ppl shill for maximalism when it suits them. The question is not IF a coin is "truly decentralized" (because that is impossible), but rather in what way IS it centralized and what are the pros and cons of the model; eg BTC's ASIC factory owners and black whales & governments vs. PoS coin holders, tech, governance, coin metrics,  ethics, usability, adoption, privacy, resiliency, etc, etc...

[09-Jan-19 11:47 AM] Lumbi#8378
I find Charlie Lee's dilemma amusing, because he is HATED by maximalists and yet has a BTC clone that requires him to defend an outdated, centrist-with-time, monopolistic, chain-analytic, PoW model.

A "hard-upgrade" could be something "mandatory" due to client support but not something that changes on a consensus level that would produce a "hard-fork" and vise versa
