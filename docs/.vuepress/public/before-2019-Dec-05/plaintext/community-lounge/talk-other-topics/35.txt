`Crypto Rich did well, I'd just like to see more.`
Yeah he actually did much better than I was expecting and I think that was in large part due to the fact that he was *actually* interested in learning about PIRATE

Yes 100% he is really into the project.

[29-Nov-18 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe THAT is the avenue to work with. 
Introduce the project to some influencers
Tell them that if they are EXCITED about the project, that a video interview or live can be set up. 
Vet them to make sure they are indeed excited,  prioritize the ones that are.

I loved that vosk was right here early on. I hope that if I do an east coast meet up he can come out.

I kinda wish vosk had done his thing **after** dp listing though
since we were still only doing trades OTC at the time, I think we missed a good chunk of that audience (especially now that all markets are depressed)

I don't think he'd mind revisiting ARRR and an update at some point.

Hey guys what other Projects do you Guys follow/like outside of the komodo Ecosystem ?

[29-Nov-18 10:19 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
such things exist? üòÆ

[29-Nov-18 10:20 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
jokes aside, it's hard enough just trying to follow all of the things __inside__ the Komodo Ecosystem

[29-Nov-18 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
following shit is more than a full-time job

[29-Nov-18 10:22 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
