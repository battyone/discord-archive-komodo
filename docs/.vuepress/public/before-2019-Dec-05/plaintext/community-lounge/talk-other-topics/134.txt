Can such software exist?

[30-Nov-19 12:58 PM] phm87#7395
I keep my keys in keypass. Maybe the software is keypass or sth with multi sig

[30-Nov-19 01:01 PM] Deltazulu#2710
they say to "generate the private keys"

[30-Nov-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[30-Nov-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Keys are encrypted in keypass so when I unlovk it, maybe they are generated

[30-Nov-19 01:02 PM] Deltazulu#2710
@Cryptoon i believe that too
