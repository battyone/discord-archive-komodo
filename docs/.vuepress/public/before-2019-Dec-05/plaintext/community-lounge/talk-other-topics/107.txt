But Amazon is not just tech, it's a very profitable company you are choosing to use

[12-Aug-19 12:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
what is the alternative?

[12-Aug-19 12:12 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I was about to ask

[12-Aug-19 12:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Lots of companies use Amazon btw

[12-Aug-19 12:12 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
also because with their resources, they are probably the most secure

[12-Aug-19 12:12 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
So I'm just wondering if there actually is an alternative for that

[12-Aug-19 12:13 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
there are lots for cloud storage, like photo and documents storage, but this is a different level of service

[12-Aug-19 12:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
yup

The SEC has its next deadlines to approve, deny, or delay the Bitwise and VanEck bitcoin ETF proposals on this Wednesday (August 14) and next Monday (August 19) respectively.

My guess on the probabilities for both:

Delay: 90%
Denial: 9.9%
Approval: 0.1%

[13-Aug-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it might be a stake grinding attack, as the fake stake attack was more a resource exhaustion that crashed nodes, not able to gain funds

[13-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, sorry, reading further there is a second attack called "spent stake" that allows to amplify the apparent stake. so it behaves similarily to stake grinding, but i guess is easier to conduct

[13-Aug-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a pretty simple bug to fix, apparently they allow to use a valid, but already spent utxo to stake with. that seems quite an oversight if it is true, but a lot of the PoS systems use the coinbase for staking, which bypasses most of the usual validity checks. original peercoin didnt have this vuln, but over the years the code was copied over and over and i guess the check for utxo being unspent got removed

[13-Aug-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
for komodo PoS64 chains, the staking tx is not in the coinbase and must be spendable, so the spent stake attack does not apply

What is the future of Bitcoin Hush? I listed it on the directory after someone mentioned it on the Hush channel, but I had never even heard of it before, so it's not promoted very much.
The specs are good and it has been receiving quite a lot of votes, is the project still active with development?

She mentions them a lot in this show. I think she is right to say there will be a crackdown. It already started in general, they are even giving a hard time to Coinbase and Zcash who are both fully compliant.

[17-Aug-19 12:07 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
What I would like to understand better is this...Is an exchange service like Atomic DEX fully decentralized and censorship-resistant, or is it more just non-custodial but can still be taken down?

[17-Aug-19 12:10 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
How do they manage do do this though...has to be distributed in thousands of places like Bitcoin or Tor to be able to do that and they just launched basically

[17-Aug-19 12:10 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

so the more people download the Atomic DEX application, the stronger and more censorship-resistant it becomes

[17-Aug-19 12:20 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
or does it piggyback on some existing network, a bit like dPow?
