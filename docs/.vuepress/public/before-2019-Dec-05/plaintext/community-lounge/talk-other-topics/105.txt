I had asked for opinions about a VPN (Lethean) on this thread a day ago, but didn't get any feedback.
I also asked a friend and this is what he said :
"I don't trust the dVPN that asked for a listing. They have a weak white paper that is short on technicals, and very little explanations about how exit nodes (the people selling their bandiwdth for coins) would protect themselves against illegal activities by end users"
So I decided to don't list it on the directory

[05-Aug-19 12:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
For the little I've read Lethean is a good project, I haven't read fud about it

[05-Aug-19 01:37 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I want to be very careful with which VPNs get listed, because people are tunnelling all their communications through them, they can be useful but also very harmful if made by bad people or even if just made poorly

[05-Aug-19 01:38 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
also why would they incorporate a VPN in the UK, not the best place for a VPN

I've just been asked to list this wallet called "ZenGo". 
On their site they say: "there‚Äôs no private key to worry about. Instead, your security is distributed between your device and ZenGo servers. So even if we get hacked or you lose your wallet, your assets are always safe. You get maximum security with complete control."
Any thoughts?

their tech might be solid
"threshold signatures"
but their advertising is misleading
they say 'keyless', but what they mean is, they integrated icloud with their app as a backup solution for the user's half of the private key
so the user won't lose coins even if they lose the device

Any big explosion has a mushroom cloud, it's not a thing specific to atomic ones

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
But there could be nuclear material in the deposit and danger of contamination in surrounding areas

[06-Aug-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if it were a conventional explosion it would be the biggest conventional explosion to date

[06-Aug-19 01:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if it were several bombs detonating, would be very difficult to have them explode at the same time to get one big explosion like this

[06-Aug-19 01:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but given what lumbi posted, I assume radioactive materials being spread due to the explosion and not as a result from the explosion itself might also be a major concern
