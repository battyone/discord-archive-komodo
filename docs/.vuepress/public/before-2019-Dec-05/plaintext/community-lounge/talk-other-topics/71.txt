CoinRivet sued by Calvin Ayre. I'm suing Calvin for $800 mil. Calvin stated that I committed murder. Completely unsubstantiable. Cuba is a Civil Law country - making lawsuits diffucult. However, I traced his assets to other countries. I will bankrupt him.

[14-Apr-19 01:29 PM] designer#4893
Technology superiority is paramount to businesses, but it is hard to frame market competition and even capture consumer memory.

[14-Apr-19 01:34 PM] designer#4893
I hope to keep in mind that "first" and "market leader" are not synonyms.

[14-Apr-19 01:38 PM] designer#4893
the unique frame should be a way to capture consumer memory. 
the fictional image that lies in consumer memory is more important than the actual product quality.
so far, the iPhone has done well, but Galaxy is not doing well. 
the frame is too strong and can not be broken by improving the Galaxy quality every year. 
so it is important to have a new frame that shows what Samsung is doing well, and a strategy to engrave that frame into consumer memories.

[14-Apr-19 01:46 PM] designer#4893
How about a new "one and only" frame? 
you talk to about the story of 'fast chaser' and 'market leader', but our product is the only one in the world. 
In fact, it is fiction. 
however, 'quick pursuits' and 'market leaders' are just 'fictional frames', just as Samsung has enough reason to feel unfair. 
the important thing is to get out of there. 
to get out of it, you have to throw a new Samsung-led frame.

[14-Apr-19 01:50 PM] designer#4893
I would like to grasp the triangle of 'technology', 'imitation' and 'art' in order to create a unique frame. 
It is this triangle that emphasizes that 'first' and 'market leader' are not synonymous. 
there are many examples of 'first technology' that fall under the curse of the winner. 
also, the first technique is necessarily imitated. 
there are two kinds of imitation. 
it is fake and art. 
for example, the fake is old chinese products and art is apple products.

[14-Apr-19 01:54 PM] designer#4893
I hoped to delay the launch of the Galaxy Fold as much as possible because it is highly likely to ignore the triangle if we are overly immersed in the 'first' to become a 'market leader.' 
It is just showing my cards to the enemy. 
In the end, it can be reduced to the mastery of the master who brought the imitation up to the level of art. 
so I hoped to bring out the maturity as much as possible and to come out into the world with a unique frame that can not be compared.

[15-Apr-19 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, try dropping 10 tonnes of water on a half collapsed/burnt 800 year old structure... would probably do a lot more harm than normal fire extinguishing

While DEXes are cool, I don't know of any existing ones that perform cross-blockchain trades. If you implement your own chain, you'd better have support from the centralized exchanges, or you're out doing back alley "OTC" deals for worthless numbers.

Adam Back back got his letter from Craig today so he will also have a chance to tell his story  under oath in a UK court.  He must really be happy about this given how loud he has been in the last week on his opinions.  :-)

After 16hr:35min of elapsed time, 8 failed payments, 2 refused channels, 3 manually-opened channels, 1 channel opened by autopilot, and hours waiting for confirmations, I am pleased to report that I succeeded in sending $1 from LND to Bitlum and back again. 

The future is...

Anyone actively involved in trying to stop Craig from proving his legitimate legacy to the world is involved in this fraud against Humanity.  We need the Truth now!

The father of Bitcoin is Dr Craig Wright.
