What's your opinion on this ...did Mastodon do the right thing?

[08-Sep-19 02:38 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Many say that GAB is a tool made by neo-nazis, so they are getting banned everywhere, including app stores, browsers etc. It's a difficult subject, because on one side you want free speech, but on the other hand... is what they push just "hate speech" really

saying there are only 2 genders is hate speech now. Scientific fact is hate speech. Think about that.

Free speech is good, but violence is not, so how do you draw a line

[08-Sep-19 03:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
the overwhelming majority of gun violence in america has nothing to do with so called incels.

[08-Sep-19 03:45 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

otherwise it's total chaos

[08-Sep-19 03:46 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
for example is someone started spamming Discord with lots of violent stuff, they would probably soon be banned

[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
There are entire discords out there that would make your blood curl and turn your hair grey. I would ban them in an instant. but regulating free speech will not make shit like that go away. It's just using a straw man argument to rip away rights

[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
definitely not easy

[08-Sep-19 04:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
Certain things were social taboo and were never spoken of . In the current world is seems the only things that are demonized are the things that keep societies together, most likely in an effort to rip them apart. Families, tight knit communities, and healthy relations/dialog.  Now it's all just, "fuck you, die fascist, or liberal commie scum." It's divide and conquer writ large and pervasively.  I feel like I'm watching society collapse sometimes.

There was this project called Beenest, that was supposed to replace Airbnb with their platform and BEE tokens and they raised a lot of money with an ICO.
Now they don't even mention the BEE token on their site anymore:

The site looks nice, probably legal advice/sec led them away from crypto.

I think nobody was using their tokens or crypto and they just made it into a poor copy of Airbnb, quite sad

There isn't even a mention of cryptocurrencies, not just their BEE token

But there isn't even an explanation to their token's early investors
