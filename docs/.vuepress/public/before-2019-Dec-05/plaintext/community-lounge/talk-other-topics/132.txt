user won't know when a channel is opened or closed

[14-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe create a secondary fast trading LN network apart from atomicdex

[14-Nov-19 10:18 PM] phm87#7395
similarly, when you ask a withdrawal on bittrex, several minutes later, a big tx happens to do many withdrawals including yours. Nearly no user will check tx fee

[14-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also LN only for btc

[14-Nov-19 10:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You would create a btc peg on kmd network

[14-Nov-19 10:19 PM] phm87#7395
if we keep reasonable limits, I think it is safe to use LN into atomicdex (but jl777 said he don't agree)

[14-Nov-19 10:19 PM] phm87#7395
a btc peg on ac KMD assetchain (cc peg) is more acceptable

[14-Nov-19 10:19 PM] phm87#7395
but BTC users won't play with this

[14-Nov-19 10:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I disagree

[14-Nov-19 10:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Waves , NXT Ardor Wrapped BTC

[14-Nov-19 10:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
All the same concept .

[14-Nov-19 10:21 PM] phm87#7395
How will they convert their LN BTC (or onchain BTC) to the assetchain ? An exchange ? atomicdex maybe

[14-Nov-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
I understand what you mean about the tech and I agree on that but I think we disagree on how ppl will send the (onchain or offchain) BTC

[14-Nov-19 10:22 PM] phm87#7395
(sorry, I changed the subject from SEO of adult websites to LN into atomicdex and wrapped BTC)

[14-Nov-19 10:23 PM] jspook16#3059
It's all good. I think the consensus was the KMD won't fill that market

[14-Nov-19 10:28 PM] phm87#7395
yeah but I wanted to talk more about SEO and KMD

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] jspook16#3059
How would kmd fit in?

[14-Nov-19 10:36 PM] phm87#7395
I mean that SEO in KMD world is not very used and it can be good to use it more somehow (ARRR seems better at it whatever they do it on purpose or not). I shared few SEO links few months ago and I was surprised that nobody reacted whatever many persons owns websites

[14-Nov-19 10:37 PM] phm87#7395
ETH, RVN and KMD covers similar use cases, it can be difficult to compete except if we target more

[14-Nov-19 10:39 PM] phm87#7395
to give you an example, I have many difficulties to find anything related to komodo using google (because an Island and/or lizard have the same name). I didn't had a look at how google see the docs of KMD but I hope that they respects google standards

[14-Nov-19 10:40 PM] phm87#7395
it is sad but the centralized Google writes the rules here and it is not easy to lure it

[14-Nov-19 10:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
SEO on Komodo website needs work,  2 years of constantly changing shit wrecks what you have built

[14-Nov-19 10:42 PM] phm87#7395
but the good news is that the crypto / smart contrat sectors are not too competitive compared to adult websites

[14-Nov-19 10:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We need backlinks

[14-Nov-19 10:44 PM] phm87#7395
I can give hints but I guess/hope that it is already done

[14-Nov-19 10:45 PM] phm87#7395
and honestly, you don't neeeed backlinks, you just need good unique content that don't change, I'll give you an example

[14-Nov-19 10:46 PM] phm87#7395
if you type on google "how to mine gobyte", you'll see the forum of my pool unimining.net in third position. It was first until few weeks ago

[14-Nov-19 10:47 PM] jspook16#3059
What are backlinks

[14-Nov-19 10:47 PM] phm87#7395
link from a website to another website

[14-Nov-19 10:48 PM] phm87#7395
on your twitter account (or youtube) you can define a website, the link is indexed by google and taken into account

[14-Nov-19 10:48 PM] phm87#7395
a while ago, only backlinks matters

[14-Nov-19 10:48 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy

[14-Nov-19 10:49 PM] phm87#7395
Google bots are more and more intelligent, they identify fakes and copies

[14-Nov-19 10:49 PM] phm87#7395
Google controls many things so they know when accounts are fakes, you need to use vpn and rotate ip

[14-Nov-19 10:50 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok so where do you see kmd in regards to merchant services, adult or not?

[14-Nov-19 10:50 PM] jspook16#3059
I guess I'm trying to find a real use case that kmd can fill

[14-Nov-19 10:50 PM] jspook16#3059
The tech is there

[14-Nov-19 10:51 PM] phm87#7395
as example, if you look at the followers of KMD and ARRR twitters, you'll see many obvious fakes or bots (I think they paid for this), I won't say that it is bad because I made the same thing (but without paying), it is worthless at the end: these twittos are not humans, they won't use any services

[14-Nov-19 10:52 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok..

[14-Nov-19 10:53 PM] phm87#7395
I'll discuss with marketing later (I won't copy paste all KMD docs and adapts few html stuff to suck google)

[14-Nov-19 11:11 PM] phm87#7395
@jspook16 regarding your question ``Ok so where do you see kmd in regards to merchant services, adult or not?`` pegged on something (as discussed earlier with poly), we can replace the something with lower fees. If the interface is BTC compatible, the website can easily add a kmd smartchain without knowing it is one. I imagine to do add it into btcpayserver with wrapped BTC as they add LN stuff into it

[14-Nov-19 11:12 PM] phm87#7395
if they refuse the PR, we can still use and promote our fork of btcpayserver with the pegged assetchain

[14-Nov-19 11:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@phm87  backlinks still do wonders.   Even self propagated ones.   All other things being equal the site with the better backlink portfolio will rank higher.    I would like to see the community link drop more.  Tons of reddit-style sites and others that it would be good to have a stream of our content going .

[14-Nov-19 11:27 PM] phm87#7395
I did nothing myself until now ... but honestly, KMD is not a random shitcoin that I can promote easily based on its bitcointalk announcement. I needed to learn stuff

[14-Nov-19 11:28 PM] phm87#7395
I can help about SEO but I don't want to transform KMD into XVG (from marketing point of view)

[14-Nov-19 11:29 PM] phm87#7395
one idea can be to have one discord channel with posts that people can share/RT (we already have twitter feed but we need to add linkedin and other social medias)

[14-Nov-19 11:31 PM] phm87#7395
another idea is to have a translation budget with bounties: KMD team write docs in some languages and community can translate for free or for bounties

[14-Nov-19 11:33 PM] phm87#7395
Right now, I think that KMD team is translating to chinese but it can be cool to have docs in japanese (maybe @CrisF can help), korean, indi. I don't know if docs are translated in russian (whatever part of the team is russian speaker)

[14-Nov-19 11:34 PM] phm87#7395
I saw nearly nothing in french on KMD, as french speaker, i'd like to translate but without any bounty or else, ppl will write docs around their business (pools, smart contracts, consulting, exchange, stores)

In a recent report, India's Market Research Future (MRFR), a market research institute, predicted that the size of blockchain's market in its supply chain will continue to grow 87 percent every year between 2018 and 23. It means that the amount will grow from $81.4 million in 2017 to $3.485 billion in 2023.

Major players who are playing for this goal cited IBM and Microsoft in the U.S., Abra in SAP, Deloitte in the U.K. and BitFury Group in the Netherlands. The report predicted that even after the blockchain changes the rules of the global supply chain, some countries in North America and Europe will take the dominant position in the supply chain. The prediction is in line with some experts' claims that Bitcoin and Blockchain will further solidify the U.S. dominant position.

China banned the bitcoin exchange, but is sending news that the People's Bank of China will issue digital yuan. Those who understand blockchain as a technology-based source of evidence claim that China is leading in this area. However, in terms of interpreting the meaning of blockchain and cryptocurrency in terms of global supply chain changes, China's approach is useless to change the game. most government is also struggling to understand the current supply chain. It will take more time for the idea to be able to take full advantage of the blockchain to change people's position in the global supply chain.

Order is the domain of the public It may be more than an empirical rule that those who have put resources into the public domain can seize opportunities in creating a new order. most society as a whole has a low understanding of the nature of the order currently in place, the rules revealed or hidden in the game. This may be the biggest barrier to understanding the meaning of the rule-changer Bitcoin or blockchain.
