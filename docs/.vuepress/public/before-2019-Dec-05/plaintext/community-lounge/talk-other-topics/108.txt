I‚Äôm sure Charlie didn‚Äôt establish the Foundation, donate to it himself, buy a bank, and then pay himself all the donations thru that mechanism.

Charlie is a very good, ethical dude. Only assholes would do that.

[17-Aug-19 07:50 PM] joe2x4#5987
5meoDMT is not something I would recommend to most people. You need to be a psychedelic warrior if you want to go there. And with a loud buzz that starts in your third eye, It's like being shot out of a cannon. And when you let go, you transcend space and time and go to the void. 30 seconds later, back in your body with some crazy euphoria. (Hopefully you didn't puke on yourself) DMT however, much much much milder. That I would recommend to everyone who wants a spiritual awakening.

There are no private fiat onramp except for non-listed OTC offers. For that you need to know someone who wants to buy your crypto without doing any KYC.

bitcoin and blockchain at the center of the new international.

maintaining or changing the global supply chain is the very essence of geopolitics. numerous wars in history have been linked to the problem of safeguarding or destroying supply chains. even though the war was apparently intensified by conflicts of religion or ideology, many of it was due to the securing of resources by sea or by sea. even if it wasn't the starting point, the supply chain inevitably changed as a result of the war. the hegemonic state is committed to maintaining the supply chain, which is recognized as the hegemonic state's right and obligation. other countries want their people or businesses to have a better position in the value chain.

such an outward-looking supply chain must be visible and undergo war or equivalent upheaval to change the order once stuck. on the other hand, changes in the quality of the supply chain due to the development of the technology are suddenly completed. When the government recognizes it, it is likely that the change has already progressed irrevocably.

bitcoin and blockchain are qualitative factors that change global supply chain at different levels. If the two change the global supply chain on a fundamental level, it would be like changing the international order without firing a single shot.

major players who are playing for this goal are IBM and Microsoft of the U.S., ABRA of SAP, Deloitte of the U.K. and Bitfury Group of the Netherlands. report predicted that even after blockchain changed the rules of the global supply chain, some countries in North America and Europe will have a dominant position in the supply chain. The prediction is in line with some experts' claims that Bitcoin and blockchain will further solidify America's dominant position.

China has banned the Bitcoin exchange, but the People's Bank of China has stepped up to issue digital yuan. those who understand blockchain based on technology use it as the basis for their argument that China is ahead in this field as well. however, in terms of interpreting the meaning of blockchain and cryptocurrency in terms of changing the global supply chain, China's approach is of little use to changing the landscape. It will take more time to even think that it can change the people's status in the global supply chain by actively using blockchain.

order is a public domain. It may be more than a rule of thumb that those who have put resources into the public sector can seize opportunities in creating a new order. Society as a whole has a low level of understanding of the nature of the order in which it is currently in, the revealed or hidden rules of the game. This could be the biggest barrier to understanding the meaning of the rule-changer bitcoin or blockchain.
