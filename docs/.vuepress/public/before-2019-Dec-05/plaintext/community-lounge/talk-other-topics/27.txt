my propaganda again :pirate:

[18-Oct-18 05:59 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
@benohanlon Hey Ben. Regarding the infographic. I see the the voting system has been added. Was this a change in the rules midway? From team judging to community voting, precisely?

[18-Oct-18 06:11 PM] benohanlon#1119
@MoldyLunchbox we didn't expect so many good submissions that's why we extended for a round of community voting. It had a lot more activity too. So we wanted to maximise on the opportunity. Therefore I suggested the team narrow the selection down. We wanted to be sure we'd be happy with whatever won. Once narrowed down we thought the community could decide.

What did you think of the submissions?

[18-Oct-18 06:21 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
I love the submissions. They all have something special about each of them. I was asking because since I'm subscribed to the Komodo subreddit, I've been keeping tabs on it, it is also the thread with the most volume these days. There seems to be some disparities that worry me however. Hence why I asked about the change of ruling.

[18-Oct-18 06:24 PM] benohanlon#1119
@MoldyLunchbox if you've got suggestions on how I could run it better next time I'd love to improve.

[18-Oct-18 06:24 PM] benohanlon#1119
Or if you're concerned about the votes DM me anything you'd like to flag.

[18-Oct-18 06:28 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Well, I'm not one to tell people how to run their business, and it is not my place. My only worry was the voting procedures. I fear that those with little to no social media presence have been dealt an unfair disadvantage. I was looking at the Facebook voting page when I realized how this might play out and cause some chaos within the community. Komodo is such a great project, I wouldn't want the community to be tarnished by all these... "attempts", if you know what I mean.

[18-Oct-18 06:31 PM] benohanlon#1119
@MoldyLunchbox you're welcome and invited to critique the process. Improving things is what's important. And I'm answerable to the community as well as the team.

[18-Oct-18 06:34 PM] benohanlon#1119
In terms of designers having big audiences we tracked voting in the first round.

[18-Oct-18 06:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
And also shared with a lot of people. Based on the likes and shares (low barrier to action) I didn't think it was an issue, however, I raised the barrier to commenting on the second round... I think it's actually quite hard for individuals to motivate large groups of people.

[18-Oct-18 06:36 PM] benohanlon#1119
But even if they could... Let's consider the goal of the contest which is to get more eyeballs from outside our community to look at Komodo's tech.

[18-Oct-18 06:37 PM] benohanlon#1119
So if a designer could motivate enough people to comment in depth VS email list and other communities make they're influential enough to want them to do it.

[18-Oct-18 06:38 PM] benohanlon#1119
Having said that, this was our first proper contest and there are lessons to be learned.

[18-Oct-18 06:38 PM] benohanlon#1119
I think I'll report all the feedback to the team at the end.
