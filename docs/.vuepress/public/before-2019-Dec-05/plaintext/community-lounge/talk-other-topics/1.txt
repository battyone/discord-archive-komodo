[28-May-18 05:53 AM] ptytrader#0000
That's the damn truth

[28-May-18 05:54 AM] ptytrader#0000
Often sales and marketing drive out the people who got the company to that point. I've seen it happen many times. Eventually those who are the "product" people will start their own competing services.

[28-May-18 06:54 AM] passcombo.com#0000
the "marketing" is what I meet in every aspect of "working life". Whatever you do, even if you are really good at it - you still need to advertise and do a lot of kind of marketing to build your own brand and be recognizable. Maybe it's just part of society nature. People trust in brands, authorities, because they mean more or less "many people trusted him before so he must be good". But this is tricky because since you know this is more important then what you do - you can bypass value creation and focus on the brand building, have weak products or service but well recognized brand - and people will choose you.

[28-May-18 06:55 AM] passcombo.com#0000
For new companies with good offer it's frustrating - because a lot of effort must be put into getting through, and "fighting" with other less good companies.

[28-May-18 06:55 AM] ptytrader#0000
I think a new breed of sales folk will come along that will he more in balance

[28-May-18 06:55 AM] passcombo.com#0000
So a lot of energy must be spent on sth that is not really building a better company, just a better brand.

[28-May-18 06:55 AM] ptytrader#0000
I'm speaking of the traditional sales mentality

[28-May-18 06:56 AM] passcombo.com#0000
I'm not sure - some changes will be there - but how it works is just a reflection of how most human brain works. And this won't change quickly.

[28-May-18 06:57 AM] passcombo.com#0000
However slowly we are moving from working society to information society, and more self awareness may be expected, kind of evolution may happen.

[28-May-18 06:58 AM] passcombo.com#0000
Recently I tried to change work from analytical to music / dj and I found exactly the same - a lot of effort must be done to marketing if you want to share your music and play somewhere. And I'm just goind to give up in 1 month - expectations vs realities. Much work need to be spent on sth I'm not really interested in like "getting customers" 🙂

[28-May-18 07:04 AM] ptytrader#0000
I think we have a preconceived views of what a sales team or marketing should look like. It’s true that you will encounter friction when you do things a different way but as always the pioneers will be rewarded. Maybe it’s just my wishful thinking but we need to find more organic ways of marketing products without shoving spam down people’s throats

[28-May-18 07:05 AM] ptytrader#0000
changing the priorities of a sales team is also a good start. Instead of making it the bottom line to sell as many products you can incentivize them to create value instead.

[28-May-18 07:54 AM] pondsea#0000
The product should really sell itself by solving a problem for the users it is being built for

[28-May-18 07:55 AM] pondsea#0000
Sure you need some marketing but word of mouth is the best form

[28-May-18 07:55 AM] pondsea#0000
Well and a working product lol

[28-May-18 08:37 AM] imylomylo#0000
Take houses for example.  In real estate circles, they say "well listed, half sold" - as in if you do your work as a good real estate agent to make the listing pleasing to the ppl ready to buy (finding the product-market-fit, the house-buyer-fit, it is half sold, meaning less work to sell it.

[28-May-18 08:38 AM] imylomylo#0000
need to find the right product-market fit.
