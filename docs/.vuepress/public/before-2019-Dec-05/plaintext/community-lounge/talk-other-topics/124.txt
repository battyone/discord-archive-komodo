I can't stand "bitcoin experts" like pomp at all anymore. Pomp is probably the most annoying of them all. I muted him in twitter, but he still manages to shows up in my feed all the time. Maybe I'm burned out about crypto or something, but I feel like I hate btc even more every time I see that guy.

I like pomp's btc tweets. Think I don't hate any other cryptocurrency project in ecosystem.

[29-Sep-19 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
haven't seen pomp's tweet to be super maximalist... and his spontanious answers on tv sound good to me.

[29-Sep-19 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even if it's for btc, I see the answers can be for treated for any cryptocurrency in general.

[29-Sep-19 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz, once ppl understand the importance of btc and how this whole money in modern digital world works, they will sure get to understand far beyond btc, what better options there are and how they can do better than btc.

Like every other recent US president, Trump is just a globalist puppet. He was cast to appeal to the the idealogical desires of the dying American middle class. But the political theater is pretty entertaining. Kudo's to the script writers.

No restrictions is a big word when on ETH

so it is only working with erc20 tokens on the ETH chain... but many coins in the top 100 on CMC are not erc20 on eth chain any more, eg BNB

[04-Oct-19 10:01 PM] Regnar#6164
I think we need clearer understanding of what is free and what isn't. It's certainly giving the wrong impression when people think certain parts are free, but aren't, and others are, but are claimed to not be free.

[04-Oct-19 10:02 PM] Regnar#6164
Should show something like how many software companies do this <https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/>

Show the free tier which is a link to the docs and how to list etc. and then the premium tiers which is AtomicDEX mobile GUI, and Atomicdex website etc
