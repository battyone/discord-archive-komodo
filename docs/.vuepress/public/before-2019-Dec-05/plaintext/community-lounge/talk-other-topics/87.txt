i guess they wanted to be able to do all the collecting of these segwit tx as they can?

[24-May-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
now the BCH network accepts replayed BTC segwit tx

[24-May-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and the miners can censor things with their 51% hashrate, so they can replay these and then spend them and mine them

[24-May-19 06:15 PM] jl777c#5810
when the user eventually goes to sell their BCH, they will see it is all gone

[24-May-19 07:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@jl777c didnt you create some tech for bch before the fork? Or that was the double spend protection, nothing to do with segwit?

[24-May-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing dealing with the segwit insanity

[24-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it was just a way to have normal replay protection, which got tweaked a bit and adopted by BCH (no credit given to me)

many of you living in US? I wonder how many of you ahve ever seen/participated in gun shot

[25-May-19 06:31 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or know peopl who owns guns

[25-May-19 06:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have guns, been shot at and have shot at( warning shots not to kill )

[25-May-19 06:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@polycryptoblog  could you describe why soeone was shooting you? robbery ?

[25-May-19 06:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
First time was my sociopathic sister when we were younger after a scuffle,  the other couple was because I was running with a crew I shouldn’t have been , not quite gang stuff but close enough, was a long time ago , over a decade

[25-May-19 06:35 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
specific stat in US ? I think shoting events happen different tiems in different states and so so often

[25-May-19 06:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so can yo utell you feel safe or not so much ?

[25-May-19 06:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
knowing anyone can have a guy, cause it is easy to get

[25-May-19 06:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so it is also easy to get for craxy people

[25-May-19 06:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[25-May-19 06:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I also live in a neighborhood while not too bad still had people getting shot somewhat frequently

[25-May-19 06:39 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
with vgun or with cevlar vest ? 😃

[25-May-19 06:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Both

[25-May-19 06:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
yeah well you could feel even safer driving a tank 😛

[25-May-19 06:41 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
how yo udescribe people in general aware of this , most are somewhat afraid? having guns for protection of vests for protection ?

[25-May-19 06:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Safer than waiting for police .   Most have guns don’t know too many people with vests

[25-May-19 06:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The only ones I know with vests do security work

[25-May-19 06:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Ive been in US only 3 month, NJ and NY never seen shooting or anything

[25-May-19 06:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They aren’t that frequent and mainly concentrated in bad neighborhoods

[25-May-19 06:45 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I wonder how much it is that easy access for having guns make it easier for bad guys to make more bad situations (or crazy people to make harm or just alow for accidents with guns) then actually help to protect

[25-May-19 06:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
you cant actualyl protect against mafia / organized crim

[25-May-19 06:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so you can only protect against stupid people or crazy

[25-May-19 06:46 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and for this case easy access for guns actually might increase harmful potential

disarming is hard, once you introduced guns, really hard to make it in a manner to have less crimes

[25-May-19 06:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
possibly bad guys will keep gun

outlawing anything only punishes "normal" people because criminals don't care if it's illegal

[25-May-19 06:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622

open source serves as a catalyst for innovation by drawing the participation of various developers around the world. few of the various new technologies, which are the main pillars of the fourth industrial revolution, have anything to do with open source. In the future, the seeds of innovation are likely to emerge first from open and decentralized open sources, not from a closed and bureaucratic system. Microsoft is betting on open source because it sees this point. Microsoft clearly understands that it is right to leave the flow to the dynamic currents because it is impossible to control the ocean completely. this is a valuable lesson learned after Microsoft gave up its hegemony in the mobile market to other rivals.

It is not yet clear what big picture Microsoft is painting with ION. perhaps Microsoft, as a rival to Google and Facebook, which have amassed huge amounts of personal information through multi-device simple logins, may use the ION. or it may use ION for services offered by its game platform Xbox and other game platforms in the face of Google's invasion of cloud games. In any case, Microsoft is likely to dominate the decentralized ID standard for now and then step on the pedal of popularization and commercialization in earnest when the market opens later.

Microsoft, in love with open source, has begun betting on bitcoin. bitcoin's neutrality, which has no interest in a particular entity, must have been an interesting subject of study for Microsoft, which realized the potential for open source. Microsoft's move to plan the deployment of services based on bitcoin public blockchain is markedly different from other companies that are issuing their own stable coins or building private blockchain mainnet. Microsoft's experience in transforming itself from a closed monopoly to a leading company for openness and innovation stands out. a proverb comes to mind: "He who builds a castle is doomed, he who pierces a path is exuberant."

@Microsoft is building an open source, layer two decentralized identity network on top of Bitcoin called ION. This network will enable people to control their own digital IDs and associated personal information.
