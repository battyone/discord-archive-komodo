So far, gold has been the only way for an individual to protect his or her wealth against a country run by irresponsible elites. But as seen in the case of the United States, if the state confiscated gold, the individual's assets were forced to be helplessly exposed to the country's tyranny. What's encouraging is that the alternative to gold has emerged since 2009. A neutral one that is as scarce as gold and does not belong to a particular subject. However, compared to gold, it is not easy for the state to confiscate unilaterally, it is easier to convey values across borders, and it enhances an individual's economic independence. This is the right definition of bitcoin, called digital gold.

[14-May-19 09:12 AM] designer#4893
The World Gold Association's denunciation of bitcoin is like the radio association's degrading of TV and the wagon association's cutting down on cars. An error made by the World Gold Association is that it overlooked the fact that Bitcoin has only been in the world for 10 years. Comparing bitcoin to gold at the same time is like comparing the physical abilities of a newborn and a healthy adult. Now, the problem with bitcoin is that most of the time, gold has suffered the same in the past, which can be overcome enough over time. Of course, it is hard to say that bitcoin completely replaces gold in a short period of time. However, if bitcoin slowly builds trust as digital gold, the role of gold, which is used for financial purposes, is gradually transferred to bitcoin.

Given that Bitcoin is slowly evolving into digital gold, it is necessary to seriously think about the possibility of Bitcoin taking over the role it played in the gold standard.

Gold has 0 merchant adoption.

[14-May-19 12:50 PM] PTYX#6840
And Bitcoin is becoming a settlement layer underneath financial services

[14-May-19 12:51 PM] PTYX#6840
Btc will win out in the long haul. In fact, before they take the gold out of the ground they are 90-95% sure of the amount of gold underneath. You could easily tokenize that and remove the need to destroy the earth. If you own the digital representation of the gold, you have a stake of the gold in the ground.

[14-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
gold confiscations limit its usefulness as store of value, always it is made illegal and confiscated when the nationstate needs to boost revenues

[14-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, only the rich and criminals would have gold, so the masses would certainly vote for any such confiscations

[14-May-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
privacy is the key

[14-May-19 01:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
i dont think privacy matters until cash has disappeared

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
then it matters already

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
cash is not legal tender for many things already

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
average joe not too fussed about privacy, they can just pay cash if they want it off thebooks

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-May-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810

i think you overestimate average joes need for privacy at the moment. just my opinion üòÉ

[14-May-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but yet it is very needed to be private to protect from changes in laws

[14-May-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
just the top 1% to 10% needs to care

[14-May-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
they control vast majority of wealth anyway

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes, for elites privacy very important

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
sheeple need not worry

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
talking about average joe

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
average joe with negative net worth, probably doesnt need much privacy

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
until they do

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes

[14-May-19 01:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
we're not there yet, average joe use cash

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
until they do

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
just wait

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
as nationstates run out of money, they will need to confiscate

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but that isnt very popular

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so they will criminalize normal activies and levy fines

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
hey yes we are agreeing

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
im saying were not there yet, and you are saying we are not there yet....

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
eventually everything is subject to confiscation

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on what country you are in

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[14-May-19 01:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
obliviously accepting slow death

[14-May-19 01:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
frog will allow itself to boil to death IRL

[14-May-19 01:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if you put frog in hot water it jumps out right away

[14-May-19 01:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but put it in cool water and slowly raise temp to boil. frog will sit and stay and die

[14-May-19 01:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
i understand

[14-May-19 01:28 PM] nocturnal#2177
i decided a few years back to become part of the problem, instead of a victim

[14-May-19 01:29 PM] nocturnal#2177
you dont find that problematic?

[14-May-19 01:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
do you find inequality of wealth in fiat problematic?

[14-May-19 01:31 PM] nocturnal#2177
@cipi I was saying for most people its not top of there priorites. just saying

[14-May-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
what proof is there that crypto has more inequality of wealth?

[14-May-19 01:31 PM] nocturnal#2177
i dont have proof to hand, i am judging that from a couple of articles i have read mostly about bitcoin holdings

[14-May-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont agree with that for the sole reason that many in crypto did not require any wealth to begin with, yet to be able to generate wealth

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
in the fiat world, without money it is very hard to make money and nearly impossible to make big money

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
crypto is EXACTLY the same

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
in that respect

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] nocturnal#2177
certainly is
