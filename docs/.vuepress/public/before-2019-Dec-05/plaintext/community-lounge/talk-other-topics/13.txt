"Bitcoin," he says, "is our only hope nowadays to survive."

In the 500 years after the Religious Revolution, mankind is in a revolutionary situation every day, and Bitcoin is a by-product of the revolution and one accomplishment that is nothing new.

[10-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wouldnt that crowd the bch chain quite fast?

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but thats why it has 32MB blocks.

[10-Aug-18 12:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and they will probably just increase them to infinity eventually

[10-Aug-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is just a few days work, at least for CC tokens it was

[10-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@blackjok3r wouldn't that just bloat that chain to infinity and thus make running a node virtually impossible due to storage limitations?

[10-Aug-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there are no storage limitations in a cloud instance.... I guess thats where everything is heading.

[10-Aug-18 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
sure seems like it to me

[10-Aug-18 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
unless you use something like komodos system where there are lots of chains üòâ

[10-Aug-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
massive cloud is still easier for very large scale operations though, like the scale test, simply for currency TX, it would be more efficant to just use  multi GB blocks or something lol.

[10-Aug-18 02:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but currency TX's are unlikey needed to be in the millions per second.

[10-Aug-18 02:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Dapps however, for sure, which is where multi chain shines.

[11-Aug-18 12:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just make it uncapped lol, the processing power needed to fill 2mb blocks is huge, it would be unfeasible to for someone to spam attack your chain full at even 10mb using the TxBlaster api I am using in the scale test.

@jl777c  This is the example when I was saying (somewhere in the past) that anonymity can be broken by govs agencies like CIA anyway. They can force cheap factories to install hidden parts, nano-parts that hardly can be detected and for sure not by regular users. That's why I claim anonymity itself is not as important temporary goal for cryptocurrencies  as building  decentralized tools for new democracy which could allow people control gov more then gov control people. I'm happy  Verus started work on decentralized voting and ID. Still it will take years to implement and configure decent decentralized democratic systems online. PS anonymity still is good against most avg criminal users wanting to steal your money- so in terms of general asset protection it works against avg criminals, but not necessarily against specialized hacker groups or gov agencies?
