facehook is horrible. that being said, some presence there is warranted given the soapbox it provides. pretty sure I was kicked from one of the larger crypto groups for criticizing bitfinex. I did find a surprising number of kmd and arrr believers there.  Idk how many paths I crossed with anyone here but anyone on crypto coin trader should know they may be purging all who are not bitfinex fanboys.

Does this look like someone is notarizing data to Bitcoin Cash? <https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/address/1b1itzeSKYEKhdcthUSnNJ47Fx2U8Zwwn> and 
<https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/1b1itzeSKYEKhdcthUSnNJ47Fx2U8Zwwn>
short post about it:
<https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/one-bitcoin-cash-address-is-responsible-for-nearly-50-percent-of-the-networks-transactions-in-the-past-month/> 
apparently this one address is 50% of BCH network activity and looks like all the transactions have Op_Return data.

you have to go 500tx further to find the first one with confirmations

how much are they spamming each second?

I'd love to find out there is a VBK fork that is PoP mining to BCH, or even funnier would be Veriblock mining to BCH on accident.

i'm not sure, kinda hard to tell

Anyone going to try the new Gab, Dissenter browser beta? I currently use Brave, I don't mind the whole BAT model but admittedly I'm stuck unable to send BAT to my browser because I don't own enough ETH üòÇ

[06-May-19 08:45 PM] Regnar#6164
also the idea of BTC lightning network extensions built into the browser is interesting (I'm not well versed on LN)

[06-May-19 08:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I do have privacy concerns with Dissenter extension though, I would assume it has to ping home every time you visit a new webpage, they said they have a `comment badge` that tells you if there are comments on the page you're visiting and these don't track you, but we'll see

Bitcoin has nearly 100,000 nodes, but over 50% run vulnerable code
The number of nodes on the Bitcoin network hovers around 100,000 - which is great for decentralization - but many remain exposed to an old, epic exploit.

`almost 58 percent of Bitcoin nodes¬†are vulnerable to exploit¬†CVE-2018-17144, which allows malicious miners to crash the Bitcoin network with a costly¬†denial-of-service attack.`

`Bitcoin Core devs¬†later disclosed¬†the exploit also allows bad actors to potentially inflate Bitcoin‚Äòs supply past its 21-million limit.`

I want to see someone try to defend this. There's no way.

Just another example of government thugs brutally misusing their "authority." Go figure.

@siu - Chainmakers they were banned because they didn't silence their users unless they broke the law
