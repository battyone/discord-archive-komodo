The attack is not believed to be a consensus attack. Syscoin Block Explorer highlighted that a billion SYS had been mined from a single block and sold through a single account. By hijacking a large number of API keys, hackers were able to buy SYS through other accounts, artificially inflating the price and enabling them to profit with a reported $50m.

NASA, literally, links to and cites the paper that they swear equals "97% of scientists"; meanwhile, 97% of those invited to participate in that paper declined and 100% of those that did participate were, literally, told **not** to give their personal opinion but their opinion of _the position of the **abstract** of the paper_ says (not even if the paper backs the abstract up, but just what's in the abstract).

since it is hard to even find out what the sun's temperature is today (it seems estimates are around 5800 kelvin but it is based on the color and assuming perfect blackbody radiation) especially with solar flares being in the millions of degrees, all the climate change stuff could simply be  change of the average solar temperature.
