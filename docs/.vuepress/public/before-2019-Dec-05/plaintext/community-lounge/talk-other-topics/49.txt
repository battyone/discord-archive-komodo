Yes, it seems going back there is the goal of "green" people such as yourself.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if we define "green people" as those enamoured with tenets of efficiency, and λίθος, blocks, then there could be some distant relation. after all 🍃 s don't fall far from the bush.

[04-Feb-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The good new is that if "green" people ever get their way, then the internet will cease to function and I will stop being forced to see such silly propaganda

[04-Feb-19 03:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because the internet takes more power to function than all the "green" concepts *combined* can provide, much less after you couple that with life-sustaining needs

Solar energy efficiency is actually **reduced** if AGW is factual and "green" plans are valid and reverse the effects. But why let things like "facts" get in the way of your message?

Only wind energy is more green if you calculate total CO2/KWh over the entire cycle

[04-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Solarpanels actually take huge amounts of CO2 to produce

(you have to negate the nuclear waste though)

[04-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362

ITER - the way to new energy
ITER is the world’s largest fusion experiment. Thirty-five nations are collaborating to build and operate the ITER Tokamak, the most complex machine ever designed, to prove that fusion is a viable source of large-scale, safe, and environmentally friendly energy for the planet.

So basically we need to moon, so we can have infinite energy?

[04-Feb-19 06:05 PM] cipi#4502
yes, we can use tritium and deuterium, but Helium 3 is better... fusion with tritium and deuterium will kill your reactor chamber after some time, so you will have to replace it... i am not an physics expert though 😃

[04-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The decay product from tritium is 3H I think

[04-Feb-19 06:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And tritium can be created as a by product from nuclear fission

[04-Feb-19 06:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure if the quantities are anywhere near sufficient

[04-Feb-19 06:12 PM] cipi#4502
and if nothing helps, we will have to do mining on the moon, which is cool stuff anyway :-)
afaik the helium3 is contained in the dust from moon, so it should be easy to get it... just flying regularly to the moon to get some dust could be costly

Seeking acceleration of growth while claiming healing of inequality is the only way to improve the reality of the masses while comforting the minds of the masses. Franklin Roosevelt, who was attacked by Pearl Harbor, declared vengeance, but in his mind, he decided to fight against Germany entirely instead of Japan.
