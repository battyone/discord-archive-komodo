at this point believing he's Satoshi seems a suicide cult

But, how much of that is as a result of CEXs pulling it, rather than the market absent their power?

It wouldn't be surprising if faketoshi does some voodoo with the courts and "proves" whatever to them. They accept it and then further disrupt the ecosystem.

[17-Apr-19 04:43 PM] PTYX#6840
Sure, but while everyone is swabbling the important stuff is put off to the side.

[17-Apr-19 04:43 PM] PTYX#6840
If disruption is what they want, that would do it.

[17-Apr-19 04:44 PM] PTYX#6840
By they I mean the governments and corporations in charge behind them.

[17-Apr-19 05:57 PM] joe2x4#5987
CSW is CIA/MI6/etc. Goal is to dup people into thinking he is Satoshi so they can take over Bitcoin. Definitely a disruption agent now that folks ain't buying it.

Large ego + narcissistic scammer would have only lasted so long. Especially since he can't prove he's Satoshi, and he has no control of Satoshi fortune, what can he possibly gain by trolling the world? I don't think any ego is THAT determined to troll. He has to be an agent.

Three major tragedies in life are poverty in old age, scars in middle age and, finally, success at too young age.

Who wouldn't welcome success? But I think you should be afraid. You can see a lot of people who succeed at a young age and fall apart before the golden age of life.

If one is already successful (=money) upon birth, the problem becomes more complicated. Without a special dream or ambition, it is probably an environment that is easy to ruin.

Analyze how Millennials change the U.S. consumer market and recommend the report. 
<Brand Dissemination's Next Phase: Private labels grow as next Threat for CPG>

[20-Apr-19 01:52 PM] designer#4893
to sum up the Goldman Sachs report in one row, millennial has no brand royalties, so if the price is good, it will turn its back to a small independent brand and private label. due to this tendency, brands that have been in the safe zone will suffer from price squeeze.

[20-Apr-19 01:54 PM] designer#4893
the implications of the report are: If you don't have a brand, but you've made a product that's good in price and even has a high design, you don't have to be afraid. You can trust the Millennials and make and sell them. It may not be without difficulties, but the time is approaching when the moat of existing brands is more helpless than ever!

smart-contract, automatically implemented without the help of the court, was a dream of Western civilization. this term was not designed by Vitalik, came out in the mid-1990s, the era of the Internet. But smart-contract is a beautiful story that is hard to reach.
 
the simple contract that humans make is much more complicated than the Go game in limited space. 

nevertheless, one of the lawyers' sites in the United States, spellbound by the excitedly of the beautiful story that the smart-contract platform be developed by teen genius programmer.

they said "In the future, lawyers need to be coded to survive, but whether they are quick to teach law to coders or whether it is fast for attorneys to learn coding," they argued.

Data quantification is one of the goals of modernity, but it is still rudimentary.

The figure of corporate value of a stock company, which many stakeholders are pushing for, is also a combination of meaningless conjectures. 

Before the smart-contract, all contexts about the contract must be clearly expressed in quantified language in order for the contract to be automatically implemented. It would take dozens of books to specify all the possibilities even if they were to sign a very simple contract.

People don't get fooled if you tell a story that's But if you go beyond people's imagination and tell perfectly beautiful stories, people are unexpectedly gullible.

It may be because people are locking themselves in their own fortresses that will keep their souls beautiful from the irrationality of reality.
