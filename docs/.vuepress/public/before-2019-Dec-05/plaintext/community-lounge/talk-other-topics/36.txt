`In order to increase Aion PoW algorithm‚Äôs resistance to future ASIC designs and to diversify active Equihash parameter sets, we‚Äôve implemented to first novel set of optimized Equihash parameters, since the Zcash implementation‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEquihash2109.`

fek Aion; they are too silly for me to waste my time

[29-Nov-18 10:38 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes Just looking into it. Dont know what to think yet

[29-Nov-18 10:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Equihash was fairly decent idea (except for the RAM theory) as a new "resistance", but once ASICs exist, any change that's merely a RAM requirement change is 0 resistance
