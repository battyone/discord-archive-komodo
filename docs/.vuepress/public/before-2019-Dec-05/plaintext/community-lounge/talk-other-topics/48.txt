[01-Feb-19 04:16 PM] Acura#2748
Ultimately, the only way for Zcash to truly ensure the
size of its anonymity set is to require all transactions to
take place within the shielded pool, or otherwise significantly expand the usage of it. This may soon be computationally feasible given emerging advances in the underlying cryptographic techniques [6], or even if more mainstream wallet providers like Jaxx roll out support for z13
addresses. More broadly, we view it as an interesting regulatory question whether or not mainstream exchanges
would continue to transact with Zcash if it switched to
supporting only z-addresses.

If you don't use private addresses then you don't have privacy; who'da thunk it?

[01-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Acura#2748
The anonymity is too small if only 5% using Shielded adress/transactions 😬

[01-Feb-19 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
even the ones that do use the private addresses, dont really have it

Curious, If resistance is forked from Komodo Market Maker, does this mean that Barterdex, Hyperdex will be able to interact with resistance?  Or is it more like how btc interacts with ltc, ie not at all.

[01-Feb-19 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Hyperdex is a layer GUI, so it can be made to interact with whatever the makers decide it to interact with

Regarding the **Resistance Exchange** I love the idea of a decentralized highly anonymous exchange. The thing I don't like is the flip flop on the subject of KYC  - that's very disapointing.  I also find it tacky that the marketing is done via YouTube shillers who are getting a stake of the ICO... I would like to know if they will be holding the supposed "lockup tokens" in a locked wallet or is it in a bunch of Masternodes creaming the early gains. And if so what happens with all those rewards...

[02-Feb-19 04:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
`Compliance and Know Your Customer (KYC)

    The Resistance team is in conversations with a securities lawyer in regards to complying with all the demands the SEC has for decentralized exchanges. The simple solution is that they are not going to allow U.S. investors and users.

    With decentralized KYC, each trader on the exchange will only trade with those who have passed KYC with Shyft Network. They will not learn the identity of the other party.
        Each trade will be linked to a KYC, but no one will know who is trading, just that they have passed KYC. Decentralized KYC uses blind attestation. This means Resistance gets either a yes or no response when they validate if users have completed KYC.
        If a regulator demands to see KYC for a specific user, they will be directed to the KYC provider that approved the specific KYC. That provider will handle the regulator.
        In that way, you remain private from everyone, except from a regulator that is court ordered to see a KYC.`

The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.
