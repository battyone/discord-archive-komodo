ty üôÇ Would be interesting to determine a % of lost coin each years only due to lost password.

[06-Jun-18 04:26 PM] 1stormingj#0000
That would probably come under the 2% category listed

[06-Jun-18 04:26 PM] 1stormingj#0000
So as a portion of that, maybe between 0.3-1.5%

Interesting perspective:

"This is why interdisciplinary study is so important. There are so many problems that have affected multiple fields but were solved independently.

I know everyone shits on liberal arts degrees, but I'm a software developer with a BA in Biology from a small liberal arts school and I am constantly astounded by how much time my coworkers waste reinventing the wheel.

Software engineers are especially bad about this, they often think they are the smartest people in the room and the only reason a problem hasn't been solved is because nobody has tried using programming to solve it. You can see this in the obits from failed silicon valley start ups all the time:

"We thought we could solve [x], but we ran into the totally unforeseen problem of [y]", when [y] is a problem that literally everyone who has taken a 200 level course in [x] is familiar with. Everyone uses solution [z] instead because it avoids problem [y].

The first step when you try solving a problem should be to assume someone else already solved it and figure out how to find that person."

Great thread about how much EOS depends on a naively drafted "constitution", human-interpreted wet code. As a result EOS will be labor-intensive, permissioned, jurisdictionally biased, and will have poor social scalability. https://t.co/64XzgplMsb

sadly there is a difference between reality and ideal.
the public is not wise, irresponsible, and has no pricks of conscience.
that is why the masses are always dominated.

<@U8WFL9AMU> I think if anything, BTC is the one with the problem, as BitMain controls about 60% of the hash rate, and we know they like BCH.

[08-Jun-18 01:56 AM] maegus#0000
Yup BTC's whole plan for scaling is to cut out the miners lol. Cut off a multi billion dollar industry.

[08-Jun-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#0000
One thing we can now say for certain thoughwith all this hash being added, is that a government or 5 EYES organisation with unlimited funds could probably take over the entire crypto space if it wanted to. Especially is BTC price falls more, making all the old ASIC's unprofitable.

[08-Jun-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#0000
You can guarantee that that hash is new ASICs that are a whole lot more powerful than an S9.

[08-Jun-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Question is are, they Bitmain or a new type from a government or someone else.

>Bitcoin cash is as safe as BTC.
A difference in hash rate is a LITERAL FIGURE showing you this is false
>IMO when you have two powerhouse coins like that on the same algorithm no one is incentived to attack.
On the contrary, because bcash is large enough to have multiple locations available to short it, and easily attacked by the abundance of hash rate mining bitcoin, there's is a huge financial motive and easy avenue for a large mining farm or operation to carry out such an attack. IMO when you have two powerhouse coins like that on the same algorithm no one is incentived to attack.
>I think if anything, BTC is the one with the problem, as BitMain controls about 60% of the hash rate, and we know they like BCH.
Producing the hardware =! controlling the hardware. Bitmain are now also losing the development race to Halong and GMO. Don't mistake a temporary market lead for a monopoly
>Yup BTC's whole plan for scaling is to cut out the miners lol. Cut off a multi billion dollar industry.
No it's not. Mining will continues to be paid for by the block subsidies, channel opening/closing fees, and work to secure the chain.

[08-Jun-18 09:08 AM] passcombo.com#0000
true, are there any players owning like 25-30% of BTC hashrate? if they will to switch to 51% attack BCH - should not be a problem

[08-Jun-18 09:09 AM] passcombo.com#0000
not sure by algo which other networks can be attacked, but much smaller miners can attack probably any other coins below ?

[08-Jun-18 09:10 AM] passcombo.com#0000
owning 1% of BTC hasrate should allow to double spend in other networks - it's probably only a matter if it mapys off more to mine BTC or to attack other network

[08-Jun-18 09:11 AM] passcombo.com#0000
and BTW - is "attacking" in this sense sth immoral in any way? in the end it's just using property of network to make gains... so it's like mining - also using property of network to make profit

[08-Jun-18 09:11 AM] passcombo.com#0000
so we could actualyl say - it's natural evolution - good project will find ways, weak projects will die - evolution

[08-Jun-18 09:11 AM] smk762#0000
its hardocdes into the system, so really no different than bank bailouts. legal, but unethical.

[08-Jun-18 09:13 AM] smk762#0000
cant understand why you'd go for short term theft leading to loss of faith and value in the items stolen, rather than dominate supply long term.

[08-Jun-18 09:13 AM] jl777#0000
if you are depositing to an exchange and then using your hashrate to double spend it, there is clear intent for making an invalid deposit. probably no specific laws against it, but this is not like invoking the existing code of a blockchain to generate extra coins, it is an action against the exchange

[08-Jun-18 09:13 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Simple, because if you're a bitcoin miner you don't care about the long term heath of bch

[08-Jun-18 09:14 AM] 1stormingj#0000
This is about profit motivated decisions with clear paths to execute

ahh. greed. that old chestnut.

[08-Jun-18 09:14 AM] digitalninjaa#0000
Ver would use a 51% attack for his marketing tricks. Something like look more than 51% of btc miners have changed to mining bch üòÇ

[08-Jun-18 09:14 AM] smk762#0000
isnt usuary a form of double spend?

[08-Jun-18 09:14 AM] 1stormingj#0000
And the ultimate example of why sharing a hashing algorithm and not being the dominant chain using it is a critical security vulnerability, I mean we've seen it play out like twice a week for a while now

[08-Jun-18 09:15 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Double spend is an easy one yeah

[08-Jun-18 09:15 AM] jl777#0000
it likely violates the terms and conditions of the exchange

[08-Jun-18 09:15 AM] passcombo.com#0000
<@U02LQ1WHQ> could this also happen to BarterDEX not only CEX ?

[08-Jun-18 09:15 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Shorting seems to be less effective because irrational marketing don't care that their coin is unsecured and useless

[08-Jun-18 09:16 AM] smk762#0000
sounds like the verge holders I seen comments from

[08-Jun-18 09:16 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Unfortunately DEXs do nothing to mitigate this risk, unless you allow your users to set the number of required confs

[08-Jun-18 09:16 AM] jl777#0000
correct, or using notarizations as equivalent of many confirmations

[08-Jun-18 09:17 AM] 1stormingj#0000
In fact you're at greater risk on a DEX because you'd lose the funds, whereas a CEX has to eat the loss

[08-Jun-18 09:17 AM] passcombo.com#0000
so big palyers can decide if they want to rob cex or individuals üôÇ

but maybe it's the same

[08-Jun-18 09:18 AM] 1stormingj#0000
The best thing you can do to protect yourself on a dx is no trade unsecured coins, sticking to highest hash rate for an algo or notatization coins are good ways of doing so

[08-Jun-18 09:18 AM] 1stormingj#0000
And yeah

[08-Jun-18 09:18 AM] 1stormingj#0000
We'll probably see our first dx double spend attack on one of these shitcoins in the coming years

[08-Jun-18 09:18 AM] 1stormingj#0000
On a large scale

[08-Jun-18 09:18 AM] passcombo.com#0000
is there somwhere a summary of biggest networks by hash algo ?

[08-Jun-18 09:19 AM] 1stormingj#0000
There's a website that says how expensive it is to 51% attack different coins

[08-Jun-18 09:19 AM] 1stormingj#0000
That's probably the best substitute

[08-Jun-18 09:19 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Coins that you can buy > 51% of the hash power from nicehash are at the biggest risk

[08-Jun-18 09:19 AM] 1stormingj#0000
Coins that share an algo but can't be bought are a little less risky

[08-Jun-18 09:20 AM] 1stormingj#0000
https://www.crypto51.app/

[08-Jun-18 09:21 AM] smk762#0000
dex mitigates risk by coins being spread out. not immune to attack, but much less cost vs benefit to the attacker.
