JP Morgan to launch "JPM" Cryptocurrency Coin
Jamie Dimon once called Bitcoin a "Fraud"



Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, made his views on Cryptocurrency very clear last year as he called Bitcoin a "Scam"

imo, that kind of article is disingenuous in representation

[14-Feb-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's like reading:
`Man who says Ponzi was a scam artist opens registered credit union!`

[14-Feb-19 02:25 PM] PTYX#6840
that's what the banking types like

[14-Feb-19 02:26 PM] PTYX#6840
we can definitely say now without a doubt they see Bitcoin as a threat

[14-Feb-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I have no doubt of that, but what I'm saying is that just because he has claims against crypto (and specifically Bitcoin) doesn't by its nature make him a hypocrite *solely* because his company creates a coin that addresses the issues he presented. Which is the intended emotional elicit from the blurb

[14-Feb-19 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes and no. They always came forth with the argument for "blockchain" and against "bitcoin"

[14-Feb-19 02:30 PM] PTYX#6840
mainly because they can't control it. they didn't state that, but that's what the JPM coin solves.

[14-Feb-19 02:31 PM] PTYX#6840
It allows them to control every aspect of it and hence: "it's ok now to use this crypto to settle payments, but don't use bitcoin"

[14-Feb-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
But that was his chief complaint, that there is no control or oversight, so it's disingenuous to use phrases that make it seem hypercritical to create an instrument *with* control and oversight.
There's plenty of things to bag on him about without trying to twist perception

BREAKING: A record 7 million Americans are 90 days+ behind on their auto loan payments, a red flag for the economy, @NewYorkFed reports.

It's a million more people behind than during the financial crisis era. Many are under 30 years old.

The real funny is that it's "news" (or even noteworthy) that an additional 1% of auto loans to young are delinquent in the last 2 decades
if anything it's noteworthy because it's **only** 1% more 😣

I mean the car depreciates a looooot faster than you making payments, then it's just really a horrible deal?

[14-Feb-19 04:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you are not able to finance it at 1-2% intrest rate over a max of 4-5 years, you probably should buy a less expensive car tbh

@Cryptoon that would make sense if people that earned $19-29k a year didn't think that they "deserved" a $250k home and $35k car and 6 kids and toys because it's their "right".
Here is the US, we're taught math in school and then society teaches us to ignore that 1+1= 2 and not 30

Well maybe not the market for Ferrari 250GTO or the super early bugatti's

[15-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But air cooled porsches have appreciated insanely the past years for example and it's just not sustainable :p
