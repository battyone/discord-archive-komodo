But u said nah man, you're wrong

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@wanda at a certain point you want something to be true which makes it hard to distinguish facts from fiction

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@wanda do a search for nigerian scammers and tell me how smart people send them a few hundred thousand?

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And its easier to believe fiction as it fits your narrative

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Logic goes out the window at that point

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] wanda#4668
greed?

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And the things you want to be true

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Priva99#5191
And the woman was doing you wrong

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Greed prob also part of it

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Priva99#5191
It only took time to see

[21-Sep-19 08:34 PM] Priva99#5191
Then u felt dumb

There is a aspect of greed, but sometimes it is like having a argument with the girlfriend, you paint yourself into a corner then pride takes over

Virtually no one knows this:

Satoshi‚Äôs original code had OP_PUSHDATA4 which allows 4.3GB data to be included in a single transaction, and IPv6 supports to transport up to approximately 4.3GB packet.

[22-Sep-19 06:03 AM] Priva99#5191
I virtually knew that..
My real human self, nope

[22-Sep-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
pushdata4 and 3 are still there, even though consensus rules make it so they really are not needed, just there for completeness

[22-Sep-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is this thing called varint, which allows to encode various integer sizes based on some special prefix codes, essentially a hard coded huffman tree. and the varint supports up to 4 bytes. my guess is that supporting varint is the reason we have the unused pushdata4

@dukeleto I honestly kind of figured that was the case, kinda like raising pressure of water to raise it's freezing point, I wonder what the effects of the pressure are on the positions of the qubits though.
