@DeMarco what do you mean?

[16-Jun-18 03:32 PM] DeMarco#5676
I have CHAIN assets when I view atomic explorer in 3 of my KMD addresses. The amounts are the same, curious if this was a KMD wide airdrop or just related to notary votes.

[16-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Maybe you voted for Chainmakers?

[16-Jun-18 03:35 PM] DeMarco#5676
I did, but only from one of those addresses I think.

Because Chainmakers did airdrop coins to its voters.

[16-Jun-18 03:39 PM] DeMarco#5676
Maybe I did vote for them from all three.
