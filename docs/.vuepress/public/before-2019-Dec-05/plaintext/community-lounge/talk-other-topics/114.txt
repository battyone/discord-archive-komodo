@PTYX how so?

[16-Sep-19 03:55 PM] PTYX#6840
they launched services that became ubiquitous

[16-Sep-19 03:56 PM] PTYX#6840
what cryptocurrency, good for the earth, or "decentralized" project has done that?

[16-Sep-19 03:57 PM] PTYX#6840
but in order to argue about whether they are good or not, we'd need to establish the meaning of "good"

[16-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Lumbi#8378
@PTYX  ... the public good?

[16-Sep-19 04:00 PM] PTYX#6840
what is the public good

[16-Sep-19 04:01 PM] PTYX#6840
the dictionary says

[16-Sep-19 04:01 PM] PTYX#6840
```Economics
a commodity or service that is provided without profit to all members of a society, either by the government or a private individual or organization.
"a conviction that library informational services are a public good, not a commercial commodity"
2.
the benefit or well-being of the public.
"the public good clearly demands independent action"```

[16-Sep-19 04:02 PM] PTYX#6840
is UNESCO for the public good?

[16-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Lumbi#8378
@PTYX or the benefit of the many (rather than the few)?

[16-Sep-19 04:02 PM] PTYX#6840
ok, point me to an example of a "good" company

[16-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Lumbi#8378
drinkable water is a "public good" (vs. ground water polluting factories).

[16-Sep-19 04:02 PM] PTYX#6840
hmmm

[16-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Lumbi#8378
a good company benefits more than it harms

[16-Sep-19 04:04 PM] PTYX#6840
Nestle has clean water

[16-Sep-19 04:04 PM] PTYX#6840
or drinkable water

[16-Sep-19 04:04 PM] PTYX#6840
i think the definition of "good" is very nuanced and almost impossible to argue because it's subjective

[16-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Lumbi#8378
it's profit motive could be against the public good, if it uses lobbyists to block environmental legislation that would make tap water drinkable...

[16-Sep-19 04:06 PM] PTYX#6840
why not have "good" lobbyists

[16-Sep-19 04:06 PM] PTYX#6840
seems to me that it's the only way politicians get off their ass is with a good lobby

[16-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Lumbi#8378
lobbyists could be used for good... if the economic system allows for adequate participation on that level...

[16-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Lumbi#8378
...how 'democratically participatory' are 'economics' ?

Why do we need politicians again? Insanity is trusting the people who create the problems to fix the problem. It seems that politicians were societies fix to the Byzantine general problem. Can't trust each other so we elect them under trust that they work to benefit society. But politicians are scum humans. Can't trust them either. We can trust POW  however.

Blockchain voting WILL be a human right soon.

Transparency and Auditability WILL follow.

[16-Sep-19 05:25 PM] PTYX#6840
It's naive to think that all of humanity's problems will be solved with trust less or decentralized systems. There's still the human element in everything aspect of society that you must deal with.

[16-Sep-19 05:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Just from my perspective it seems most people need or are molded to trust others to do things on their behalf. In order to really change things you'd need to tear down the establishment.

[16-Sep-19 05:28 PM] PTYX#6840
And even then, you'd have quasi-establishments pop-up to represent a certain people.

[16-Sep-19 05:44 PM] Lumbi#8378
Incremental steps into futurity; why can't that look more civilised than in yesteryears? Technology is a miracle if done right and can do much to repair even past damages.

General consensus amongst a population of sheep may be to place trust in the wolf. the experiment must start small. kind of like this one. I like the idea of republic based model. Humans will always be necessary to manage/communicate things for other Humans. like fleshy API endpoints.

[16-Sep-19 08:16 PM] liqdmetal#8650
is that supposed to be a balanced analysis or a pirate advertisement

[16-Sep-19 08:17 PM] liqdmetal#8650
no too biased, but just enough  to be advertising

[16-Sep-19 08:23 PM] liqdmetal#8650
what is connection of pirate to atomicdex? i mean, ARR is just a fork of zcash

[16-Sep-19 08:23 PM] actionslacks#4072
idk, it's just to demonstrate that this comparison has been made previously. all the pros and cons are there for both protocols.

[16-Sep-19 08:23 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin should be put on the atomic dex

[16-Sep-19 08:24 PM] liqdmetal#8650
some pro cons and some pirate advertisement

[16-Sep-19 08:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
atomic dex currently only works with btc and eth related blockchains. but anything is possible I imagine

[16-Sep-19 08:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
This isn't some tribalistic winner take all project. Everyone involved with Atomic Dex is throwing real money and time at integrating as many protocols as possible. Your claim that people are defensive or biased isn't really supported by the body of work so far.

[16-Sep-19 08:43 PM] liqdmetal#8650
what you posted was advertising, there seems to be little substance to pirate other than marketing. check the githubs and see where more coding is being done. several fellows here have thrown out half truths or half the picture due to their bias

[16-Sep-19 08:44 PM] liqdmetal#8650
more coins on the atomic dex is best practice

[16-Sep-19 08:45 PM] liqdmetal#8650
no anonymity is yet perfected either

[16-Sep-19 08:45 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i also have some questions as to how the atomic dex works but i have not gotten to that yet

[16-Sep-19 08:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Code it up and we will add it

[16-Sep-19 08:46 PM] liqdmetal#8650
its my idea, but i am not a coder, if someone else catches whiff and can/will code, that would be ideal

[16-Sep-19 08:46 PM] liqdmetal#8650
it's no real good idea either heh

[16-Sep-19 08:46 PM] liqdmetal#8650
pretty basic, you would think

[16-Sep-19 08:47 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i mean if pirate coin is getting added

[16-Sep-19 08:47 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin is a no fucking brainer lmao

[16-Sep-19 08:47 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin devs are busy with other things

[16-Sep-19 08:48 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i mean creators of atomic dex would want it to be the best it can be? or to support incestuous projects only?

[16-Sep-19 08:48 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i truly wonder where the pushback is here regarding my suggestion which is to my eye very congruent

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] jorian#4555
You're a grin shiller?

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] liqdmetal#8650
zcash zsnarks

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] liqdmetal#8650
kek

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You are suggesting that we take our resources and apply to another project.   If they want to be in they can add it

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] liqdmetal#8650
if you dont think grin is a good candidate for inclusion on the dex but pirate is

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] liqdmetal#8650
heh

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] jorian#4555
You're in the Komodo discord

[16-Sep-19 08:49 PM] jorian#4555
What do you expect

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
which is an atomicdex discord?

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
adding coins to that is related

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
only fanboy pirate coin allowed cause komodo crew benefits there?

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
amiright?

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
that is the sentiment i am picking up

[16-Sep-19 08:50 PM] liqdmetal#8650
prove me wrong

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] jorian#4555
Of course there is a favor to pirate, nothing wrong with that, it's a successful Ecosystem project

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Nix and Dash also are integrated

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
So no it’s not only pirate

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] jorian#4555
Now you come in, saying nothing but grin needs integration

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] liqdmetal#8650
false that was just a suggestion

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] jorian#4555
Meh

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] liqdmetal#8650
and grin has merit

[16-Sep-19 08:51 PM] liqdmetal#8650
more merit than pirate

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
simple as that

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
are you enthusiasts or salespeople

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
which is it

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] jorian#4555
Saying pirate is just a zcash fork proves enough

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
that is primarily what it is, is it not

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
other than having only private sends

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i mean

[16-Sep-19 08:52 PM] liqdmetal#8650
cmon

[16-Sep-19 08:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can observe Grin inputs and outputs you can’t observe pirates .

[16-Sep-19 08:53 PM] liqdmetal#8650
this is not a which is more anonymous, i will give slight edge to zksnark coins in that regard

[16-Sep-19 08:54 PM] jorian#4555
I can guarantee that pirate has more anonymity than zec

[16-Sep-19 08:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No one has said Grin can’t be added,  but expecting us to do the work for free is not reasonable.

[16-Sep-19 08:55 PM] liqdmetal#8650
yes, requiring anonymous transactions is better

[16-Sep-19 08:55 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin team works for donations

[16-Sep-19 08:55 PM] liqdmetal#8650
fdunding model also not relevant

[16-Sep-19 08:55 PM] liqdmetal#8650
more coins = better atomicdex

[16-Sep-19 08:56 PM] jorian#4555
So Komodo devs should add some wildly ecotic new coin for free, while grin devs can't because no donations

[16-Sep-19 08:56 PM] liqdmetal#8650
look jorian dont bother talking to me if you are going to put things in my mouth

[16-Sep-19 08:56 PM] liqdmetal#8650
poly was the one who brought up payment

[16-Sep-19 08:57 PM] jorian#4555
I wish I could put things in your mouth

{Reactions}
😂 🍆 

[16-Sep-19 08:57 PM] liqdmetal#8650
grin devs are working on other things, im sure they could help the atomicdex devs, between the two devs lies the path to most efficient integration

[16-Sep-19 08:57 PM] liqdmetal#8650
i dont speak for any devs though
