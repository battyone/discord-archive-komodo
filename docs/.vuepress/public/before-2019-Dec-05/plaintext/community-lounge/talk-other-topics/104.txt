A 51% attack on Expanse (EXP) was detected by @metalicjames' tracker. Summary:

- EXP is an ETH clone that uses Ethash, which means 70x Expanse's network hashrate is available to buy on Nicehash.
- $12 was double spent. 😂
- Likely against an exchange

Bitcoin SV appears to have had a 210MB block. This may have sent our node offline and we are struggling to restart it. Other Bitcoin SV block explorers also appear to be down

We're all familiar with the retronym 'snail mail' in regards to the traditional mail system. Let us coin the phrase 'snail money' to the traditional fiat system.

Any thoughts on it?

[04-Aug-19 08:41 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
"Any user can effectively use their computer to mine Lethean and use the mined Lethean for exit node services. This would make it "free" in the sense that you are only using electricity to pay for your VPN services."

what programming language do you recommend to learn if you want to design innovative smart contracts using komodo? don't have much time, and if have to choose and focus.

[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
C++

[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] designer#4893
thanks, what do you think of go lang?

[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
its fine, but there needs to be a way to link in the go language into the komodod

[05-Aug-19 12:30 PM] designer#4893
which languages will be added to komodo in the relatively near future, not in the distant future?

[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
at the rpc level, you can use any language

[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there are already rust modules that can be linked in and are

[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but all the blockchain code is in C++

[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so without knowing C++ you will have a hard time with all the blockchain details
