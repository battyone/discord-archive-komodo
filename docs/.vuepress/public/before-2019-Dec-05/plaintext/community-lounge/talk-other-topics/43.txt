a lot of money is spent on education in 1st world countries, and what is the result? people with little knowledge and understanding taking leaders position to impact the world, and those educated and intelligent serve them to help reach the (mostly false) goals... madness

[17-Jan-19 09:02 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
unfortaunately educations is missconception many times - like learning to memmorize. Ok it is important, but except math-related subjects (which is most) you are not tought to make conclusions from the knowledge, but just memorize it. This way you not only waste energy/time/money, but also make people believe in a dangerouc missconception, that wisdom/science = memorizing. However it is tru that having knolwefe in your mind is awsome and can be important when you are creative, but if you are not creative, you are just "dumb walking encyclopedia" that works as good as library or wikipedia maybe  😃
