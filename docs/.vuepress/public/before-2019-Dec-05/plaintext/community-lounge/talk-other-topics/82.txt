i disagree from personal experience

the more crypto i have the easier it is to make crypto

i talk about starting with nothing and building something

[14-May-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
100x easier in crypto

[14-May-19 01:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
i dont see a huge difference

[14-May-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
as to whether which is easier to do, make more fiat with fiat or more crypto with crypto, that is not so relevant

[14-May-19 01:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
both takes time

[14-May-19 01:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
and effort

[14-May-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
not in fiat world

there are systemic obstacles that cant be overcome without joining the system

[14-May-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
in fiat world, as soon as you make just a bit of money, all the built in vultures and parasites start sucking the blood out of you

[14-May-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
I started in crypto with 2BTC, when it was $400 each.

[14-May-19 01:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
i enjoy a debate with you guys. I am a big crypto fan. but i do think the crypto community has a very blinkered romanticised view

[14-May-19 01:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
and this will hurt the future of crypto

crypto has a much higher ROI for hard working smart people than fiat world

[14-May-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
that means the hardworking smart people will migrate to crypto

[14-May-19 01:36 PM] nocturnal#2177
that completely depends what you do outside crypto and

[14-May-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and be able to bootstrap and build wealth

[14-May-19 01:36 PM] nocturnal#2177

both takes smarts and effort imo

[14-May-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, of course, and relatively speaking less "friction" in crypto world (I am saying for technically knowledgeable people)

[14-May-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
in crypto, knowning tech, is like knowing the right rich people in the fiat world

[14-May-19 01:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes so arena of power shifting to knowledge and wealth

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
instead f just wealth

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the difference is that obtaining tech knowlege is decentralized, at least if you have access to internet

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
me and emmanuel were having this discussion

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
in fiat world, if you are not already part of the rich society, the best you can do is be a servant to the rich

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
that crypto is centralised around knowledge

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
knowledge alone is enough

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we agree!

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
which overall is better

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] nocturnal#2177
than just money

[14-May-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and I claim that access to knowledge is much more decentralized than access to wealth

not sure knowledge alone is enough in fiat world. it is needed, but seems insufficient. in a lot of areas you need some specific licenses,which are near impossible to obtain without having the right connections or a lot of money, hence the difficulty to bootstrap.

[14-May-19 02:18 PM] jl777c#5810
imagine you are born in africa, where at least there is electricity and internet available. in the fiat world, try going from there without any capital and create enduring value that is not able to be taxed, regulated, confiscated away. the arena being the global economy. maybe the other giant difference is that the fiat world is already VERY crowded with well financed and experienced competition for just about everything, while in crypto giant obvious areas are totally unpopulated

[14-May-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so this difference in difficulty is likely temporary and eventually it will become very hard in crypto too, but still it will be possible and open to everyone in the world

Reminder that the SEC has deadlines this Thursday & next Tuesday to approve, deny, or delay its decisions on the Bitwise & VanEck bitcoin ETF proposals. My best guess at the probabilities:

- Delay, 90%
- Denial, 9%
- Approval, 1%

Delay means new deadlines on August 14 & ...
