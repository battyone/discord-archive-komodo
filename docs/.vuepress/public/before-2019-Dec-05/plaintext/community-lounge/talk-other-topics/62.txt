It‚Äôs a republic, not a democracy... or something. If If mob rule takes over here we will have the urban centers calling all the shots for the rural areas. There will likely be a yellow vest style uprising. Only well armed, cause ‚Äòmurica. One state already passed a law to recognize the winner of the popular vote and ignore the electoral college.  If that ends up giving dems the win then mob rule it will be.

@actionslacks how well would private property be maintained, if a majority of citizens become homeless or are unable to economically sustain themselves ?

[19-Mar-19 12:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
Detroit is a pretty good example of that scenario. The big question is, if we are successful in decentralizing voting and government, would people act in their best interest? Or could they be persuaded or fooled into voting against their own well being? Do we need a sort of ‚Äúdigital constitution smart contract‚Äù to provide checks and balances? This shit kind of boggles my mind. We can already see, feel, and breathe the ramifications of our infinite resource economic models. The real wizardry will be in creating a system that benefits everyone and our environment at the same time.

lol Australia IS mobrule as vote here is compulsory .... The idea is that everyone is stupid, and will vote whoever the media tells them to in.. Either way both parties seem to just do the exact same thing anyway.

If anyone likes watching game streams etc i came across Sliver.tv yesterday while looking Theta token, And you can share your free bandwidth while watching streams to earn whats called Tfuel and there is prizes etc to be won while watching streams. Seems to keep attention longer than twitch does given the viewer can earn and win. Tried it out and earned a few Tfuel.

Kleanloop is a Fail attempt at trying to combine block chain with waste reduction. ( My opinion)

https://www.kleanloop.io

A much better idea is to use waste plastic and or other waste to create electricity to power block chain mining. 

Here are two for use at home technologies that destroy plastic and create fuel. 

https://wastebot.com

http://www.blest.co.jp/eng/service/be-h/

Wastebot ~$12500 creates a synthgas that can be run in a generator to create electricity or further refined into diesel for diesel generator.

The Blest machine ~$5500 is more of a traditional pyrolysis machine and it creates oil.

Securities law hack of the day:
- Acquire (somehow) a massive amount of a dead token
- Begin to use dead token like a security.  Ex.:  Pay pro rata dividends for your wonderful NewCo to token holders.  Or just announce a buying plan for previously dead token.

Today there was a Meeting on Mt.Gox

quick division of the numbers gives a good estimate of the payout I guess. 
-They approved 685731182544 JPY according to the document
- They have 135357839701 JPY total assets (JPY+BTC+BCH) at current prices
Meaning the payout rate would be approximately 19,7392%

Just a quick estimation of what we can expect. I also see that the trustee rejected coinlabs claim

Also my claim was approved. ü•≥

I'm a big BCH supporter just purely on the notion. I believe there will be 1 big crypto that everyone is based against(the USD is going to be usurped).

[21-Mar-19 09:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161

maybe I'm still conditioned from earlier Bitcoin years, but I really would like for a single main unit of account. A sort of general accepted measuring stick. But I've realized that you would need the right instrument to achieve it, and open source software isn't one. Hard to expect a single uber winner. There was a lot of friction moving between gold, silver, bronze, salt, pepper, etc... and yet they were used.  Much less friction moving between cryptocurrencies. I think at large scale the market will correct itself to something sane, we're still very early

[21-Mar-19 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that a lot of tech companies will be releasing their crypto projects, telegram, facebook, apple, etc
