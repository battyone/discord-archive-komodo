@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢  same lol,  though debating the merits of just getting the new ones.  I mean this year the gaming variety of nvidia will be coming out  so no major performance improvements , so it will be 1.5-2years at least before another processing based gpu comes along.  Seems like a decent lifespan.  When 1080ti drop down to 300-400 range that will be a steal. I am interested in not so much mining with GPUs but things like vectordash or vast.ai ,  do you have any experience with them ?

the essence of money is versatile. If the ecosystem is valuable, general currency is used. It is no use restricting official currency to tokens. That is, any payment method recognized outside the ecosystem can be used. That is also the definition of a valuable ecosystem. 

If the token, which is made of ICO, is universal, it is also used in other ecosystems.

But ICO tries to resemble mileage and falls into a more serious logical leap than economists who explain money, and is going to go on about it. If a worthless ecosystem recognizes an unqualified token as an official currency, it is close to claiming that the ecosystem is worthwhile and the token is money.

The real reason why many ICO are blocking in front of regulation may be hidden by the intellectual frailties of those who try ICO, the lack of reflection, and the belief in superstitious logic rather than the will of the regulatory authorities.

Bitcoin, which marks the 10th anniversary of its birth, is demanding a humble reflection on the nature of this phenomenon. No, forcing you.

Explained why I took my LN hub down. Every maximalist attacked me, without reading my review

Asked how to add LN as a payment option for my startup. No one replied

This is why https://t.co/sSd1kvBX49 exists. We prove that no one is using what they shill. But I do. https:...

`...that make it impractical even for highly technical users...`
Man, I could almost swear that that ComputerGenie guy has been saying the same thing for years (since about 5 minutes after he 1st heard of what LN was) ü§î

The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin.

This was going to happen eventually. All regulated stablecoins (Paxos, USDC and Gemini dollar) are obligated to know the source of funds coming to redemption. https://t.co/ZYE9RReaWj

I'd be very careful about that.

Looks like scam to me. No team on the website, WP is throwing a few buzzwords around without explaining how they want to implement what, github Repo doesn't have its own code yet, and (worst of all): how are users supposed to get their WavesX tokens? Sure, they log on to the WavesX Wallet, the mapping from the original Waves address to the Waves X address (where the tokens are located), but can only be done via the seed. I wouldn't enter my seed there...

[31-Dec-18 11:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Yes, very risky if the wallet is backdoored
