HempCoin(THC) is migrating to a  Komodo(KMD) Asset Chain.

The KMD migration will be 1:1 swap, migrating to OUR OWN asset chain with the availabilty to LOCK UP 50k & 100k THC secured by dPoW. Benefits of migration include upsteam update capabilities, (when KMD or ZEC update their chain with a feature THC needs), privacy secured by zk-Snarks is optional, & notary nodes as an option to add an extra layer of security and consensus. KMD's tech supports HempCoin(THC)'s interest in providing the agriculture, farming & tobacco industries with the tracking capability required to audit & track a whole crop from seed to sale.

like the silver in keyboards

[12-Apr-19 06:39 AM] Exile13#4458
"lazersteve has outlined a process to recover the silver without using nitric acid. he used a heat gun to reduce the mylar to a solid mass. one mylar at a time making small plastic balls with silver. then using borax to reclaim the elemental silver by melting the silver directly without the need of dissolving the silver first."

if satoshi was a group of people, clearly CSW is not this group of people as he is only one
if satoshi was a single person, then the technical expertise needed is far more than what CSW has shown he is capable of doing. If he can write a CC module in a weekend, I will reconsider
