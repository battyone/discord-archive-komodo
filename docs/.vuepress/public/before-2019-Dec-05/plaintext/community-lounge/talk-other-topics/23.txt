`it's fine to mention strong opinions and still stay respectful.`
@bpkdasbaum `Respect must be earned as giving respect for the simple purpose that you exist devoids all meaning of the word`
`@ComputerGenie Read again. It doesn't say respect...`
In English we have these things called prefixes and suffixes, you really should look them up.
`re·spect·ful
rəˈspek(t)fəl/
adjective: respectful
    feeling or showing deference and respect.`

Saying that being respectful doesn't involve respecting someone is the same horse-assery that got millennials to turn 'literally' into its own antonym

[09-Oct-18 12:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
No need to get upset about it either. Please don't lay words into my mouth though, I didn't say that. I actually agreed on the respect part if you recall.

[09-Oct-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I, literally, pasted the parts that "I recall".

[09-Oct-18 12:44 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, you did good on the pasting, but unfortunately not on the reading nor understanding.

[09-Oct-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
no, I read just fine; however, I reject *your* "understanding", as it fall outside of the actual meanings of the words

[09-Oct-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Had you asked for `decorum`, that would have been correct to your "understanding" of `respectful`.

[09-Oct-18 12:51 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
That's fine, you can keep your own delusions about the meaning of words. I said what I said and I meant it. I didn't say nor want to say decorum as it would have not fit. I am actually sorry here, my mistake, you also most likely read it just fine too, that's easy to do.

[09-Oct-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` I didn't say nor want to say decorum as it would have not fit. `
And that is why you're wrong.
99% of the time I lack proper decorum, it's just not in my nature.
99% of the time I am respectful to those people or things that earn my respect.

[09-Oct-18 12:55 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Do you really though? How do you know?

[09-Oct-18 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
How do I know what?

[09-Oct-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
How do I know that I lack decorum? 45 years of people going 😮 
How do I know that I'm respectful of people and things that I respect? Ask anyone that I respect.

[09-Oct-18 12:58 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
How do you know that you lack decorum and not respectfulness. Also how does it matter that you are respectful to people who earned your respect? There is no need to prep yourself up in this conversation. I believe we both know that neither has respect towards the other here.

[09-Oct-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is best to only respond to what is posted, and not base it on the person

[09-Oct-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Also how does it matter that you are respectful to people who earned your respect?`
Because, words.

[09-Oct-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How do you know that you lack decorum and not respectfulness.`
The fact that I don't follow social norms doesn't mean that I don't know what they are.

[09-Oct-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Decorum is an issue of social norms.

[09-Oct-18 01:01 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Is it a conscious choice?

[09-Oct-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's a conscious choice to not let society dictate what I say or do, yes.

[09-Oct-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because society changes

[09-Oct-18 01:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
10 years ago, 'literally' was not its own antonym.

[09-Oct-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Maybe in another 10 your "understanding" of respectful will be accurate.

[09-Oct-18 01:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Are you able or have you ever in the past followed social norms?

[09-Oct-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm perfectly *able*, I'm not mentally ill.

[09-Oct-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
At least not to that extent.

[09-Oct-18 01:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
What about the second part. Have you ever followed social norms in the past?

[09-Oct-18 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Only as a child and, even then, only under extreme duress.

[09-Oct-18 01:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Just to make it little less overblown and keep to the talking point. Social norms in terms of communication without aggravation of the other party.

[09-Oct-18 01:09 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Duress? You were forced to behave in a certain way?

[09-Oct-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Social norms in terms of communication without aggravation of the other party.`
And that's where the issue lies. I don't care if the other party is "aggravated".

[09-Oct-18 01:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Duress? You were forced to behave in a certain way?`
I'm not sure what hippy commune you were raised in but in the rest of the world parents force children to do things the children don't want to do.

[09-Oct-18 01:20 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I don't see it as an issue, interesting choice of words though. I believe you are free to do so. I am not convinced yet that you don't care. You say this, but it looks more like you are doing it on purpose or you can't help yourself. I am trying to think of a time where I was forced by my parents in a negative way. Sure there are things like taking your medicine, but I can't think of being forced to not aggravate others. My parents weren't hippies either, I learned more from good examples and learned that some communication forms had better results than others.

[09-Oct-18 01:21 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
That safespace thing is ridiculous btw imho. Noone needs that.

[09-Oct-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I am trying to think of a time where I was forced by my parents in a negative way.`
You're using `negative` here in a subjective sense, with hindsight as your guide (which is wrong).

[09-Oct-18 01:22 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I did add the non hindsight example as well.

[09-Oct-18 01:23 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I admitted there are instances of force, though it didn't have the same result on me as on you. I find that interesting.

[09-Oct-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I did add the non hindsight example as well.` I'm not seeing that bit ....

[09-Oct-18 01:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Though I don't know the complexities as well, might have been different.

[09-Oct-18 01:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Why is it wrong though? What is the right way?

[09-Oct-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why is what wrong?

[09-Oct-18 01:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
You're using negative here in a subjective sense, with hindsight as your guide (which is wrong).

[09-Oct-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because you're using your current patterned behavior and thought processes to subjectively determine what is "negative".

[09-Oct-18 01:27 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
How does that differ from your patterned behaviour?

[09-Oct-18 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm a manic depressive, I have few patterned behaviors. Of those that I do have, none relate to rigidly conforming to what any subset of the human species deems as "appropriate".
