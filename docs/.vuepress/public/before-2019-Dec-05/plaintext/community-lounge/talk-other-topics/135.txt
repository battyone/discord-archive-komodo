but i remember he described a very strange variant of shamirs, which seemed pretty bogus

[30-Nov-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
also, at the time it was supposed to have been done (we must ignore the backdating of the tulip trust), the bitcoins were not worth much at all, and to have created such custom shamirs secret handling and throwing away the privkeys... it also seems nonsense

@designer  
China prints money like the US -- straight out of thin air. The difference is, they subsidise industry (CCP party affiliates) while the US taxes companies into the dirt: "Designed in California". 

'Western pluralism'  (divide and conquer) is itself a PLA talking point that gets them access to economic, political and militarily relevant infrastructure. 

There is an engineered 'leadership crisis' in western democracies that may or may not resolve itself. 

Chinese actions are blatantly obvious in 2019. 
They are x1000 more active than the USSR ever was.

HEX is a great idea but because RH obviously gets to keep all the ETH sent to the adoption amplifier it feels like a scam.  Over 21k ETH on day 1, and it runs for 350, based on EOS ICO.
I think there is a chance RH will donate the ETH, then HEX isn't really a scam anymore,
