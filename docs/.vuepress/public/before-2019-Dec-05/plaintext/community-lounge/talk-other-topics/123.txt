Greta is abused young girl and an actress for global marxist movement to put the whole world under UN jurisdiction. Nothing to do with climate.

```
Moreover, absolutely EVERY attempt to fix or peg currencies throughout the centuries has FAILED!!!! In reality, these attempts have been an attempt to smooth out or eliminate the business cycle. Even Karl Marx wanted to eliminate the business cycle and thought confiscating everyone’s assets would kill it. Communism failed, for the business cycle CANNOT be defeated even at gunpoint.

I have warned that the immediate rally in the precious metals was NOT a breakout. I warned that there would still be one more decline to retest support. The critical factor is when the GENERAL public loses confidence in the government. That is more likely to take place AFTER the turn in the business cycle in January 2020.

Bretton Woods and the gold standard failed because they tried to fix or peg the dollar to $35 an ounce of gold, but then they spent freely and waged the Korean and Vietnam wars. This is what I mean. You cannot create any fixed exchange rate or peg and then expect the economy to relinquish its cyclical nature. It has NEVER happened, and it will NEVER happen in the future.```

I wonder how strong the kmd peg system will be? Martin Armstrong strongly suggests that it is impossible for a peg to last due to the swings in the business cycle.

[25-Sep-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a peg maintain by having the supply adjusting, not a fixed supply peg

[25-Sep-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
business cycles are nothing compared to crypto bull/bear cycles

[25-Sep-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
as the crypto value goes up, it can support more stablecoins circulating, so this is allowed to happen

[25-Sep-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
as the crypto value falls, the stablecoins are redeemed and the system balance restored

[25-Sep-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if the crypto value goes to 0, it would cause a problem but as long as there is meaningful value in the crypto, it will support the stablecoins.

I have basically said my point, obviously if @Audo  thought it the right decision to make. Then I support that. I have seen the same user on other servers before swearing and being aggressive.

[28-Sep-19 07:06 PM] Caglio#3337
Alright, I dont agree with the ban, and I was one of the guys he used to fight with, lets not talk about it anymore, until I make petition to unban him and get 12 different votes

What are your thoughts on SafeCoin and their SafeTrade exchange?
I've been asked to add them to the directory, but after some reasearch I see that there's been some controversy in the past and they are a Komodo fork. At the same time I see some good projects like Zel, RVN, Hush are listed on their exchange.

Ask @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 or @Alright about safecoin :p

[28-Sep-19 07:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
They put up a "SAFE" chain that specifically allowed all 64 **Komodo** NNs to mine at a low diff (because they understood fuckall of how Komodo works), some of those nodes did that
and that's the "attack": __people mined at the difficulty they were allowed to according to the chain code__

@D2D privacyalternatives.com  they were informed about the notaries being able to mine at easy difficulty , told james and cg and others to fuck off,  so notaries began mining at easy difficulty .  Not really an attack.

Agreed

[28-Sep-19 10:05 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
@polycryptoblog doesn't sound like a good project to list
What made me consider listing them was that their exchange had Hush, so I thought maybe the past controversies were resolved

[28-Sep-19 10:05 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
stupid nonsense is everything that pomp always says.

[28-Sep-19 10:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@D2D privacyalternatives.com  since the event we haven’t said anything to them so they might have changed their tune just caveat emptor

[28-Sep-19 10:10 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK 👍 The exchange looks ok-ish in terms  of coins listed

[28-Sep-19 10:10 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
But I noticed it doesn't have KMD for example, which I thought was strange for a Komodo fork

lmao Pomp and CZ are both fiends for engagement on social media, CT lurkers are all brainwashed by those two. I enjoy pomps podcast as the guests can be very intriguing but I don't really have anything nice to say about CZ lol

[28-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Pomp has mastered the art of social media in the scummiest ways
