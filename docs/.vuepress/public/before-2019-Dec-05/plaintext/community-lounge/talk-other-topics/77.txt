again, the extent of punishment, if any must fit the extent of crime

[07-May-19 07:58 PM] jansako#3330
one single post without anything else a life in jail should not end with

[07-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
what if the intent was to annoy you

[07-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
or to make a point

[07-May-19 07:58 PM] jansako#3330
to annoy someone is not illegal

[07-May-19 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody posting that they like hitler annoys you

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] jansako#3330
AH could say, I just wanted to annoy Stalin a bit

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] jansako#3330
it does not actually... makes me sad, if anything. I would have a conversation with them face to face...

[07-May-19 07:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
`Promoting ideologies aimed at curtailing basic freedoms is illegal in many countries` - promoting is debatable as well. if i say i like nutella, i'm just stating a fact not promoting the chocolate spread loving ideology
`you look at evidence of thought, patterns` - that is straight out of 1984

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] jansako#3330
wrong formulation, sorry

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] jansako#3330
evidence & pattern of actions Imeant

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is posted over tor, there is no info about the poster

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
trying to control people's thoughts is just plain wrong

[07-May-19 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
all that is there is what was posted, intent is not knowable without invoking thought police

[07-May-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so, if there is no illegal thoughts, then freedom of speech is equivalent

[07-May-19 08:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
`evidence & pattern of action`- in all situations that is called profiling, be it of type racial, ideological, etc is still an inefficient technique when it comes to catching malicious parties

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why we need to immediately develop 100% accurate thought decoding

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
then it can be controlled

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
one can emulate a pattern of action simply to trick that technique

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
in china they are starting to enforce the proper behaviors

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody that doesnt follow, is sent to what are basically prison

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
reeducation camp

[07-May-19 08:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, that's lovely... you jay walk and they automatically take the fine out of your bank account

[07-May-19 08:04 PM] jansako#3330
come on, human societies ALWAYS enforced proper behavior, and always will. It is what the definition of proper behavior should be is the real question

[07-May-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it will get to where if you dont give positive feedback to official party line, you will get reeducated

`this is why we need to immediately develop 100% accurate thought decoding` and end humanity as we know it.. it's useless anyway, just a bunch of biological bags of poo

[07-May-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the terminators already know what to do

[07-May-19 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
first step is to control

[07-May-19 08:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
2nd step is to re-train

[07-May-19 08:05 PM] jansako#3330
sorry folks, my 2 month old has priority on my time... he knows mind control...

[07-May-19 08:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
throw a conflict or 2 for back testing... if accuracy of over 90% is hit.. not a bad day

[07-May-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
USA had a lot more freedoms of speech, freedom of movement, etc. now it is USSA it is much less free

[07-May-19 08:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
UK is even worse.. 'mericans at least still have their guns

[07-May-19 08:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
they're planning to ban knives over there to solve the knife crime issue

[07-May-19 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
in general freedom in areas where others are not being genuinely harmed seems a good idea

[07-May-19 08:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
businesses already planned ahead and are now selling pre-cut, pre-sliced everything

[07-May-19 08:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's not a joke btw

[07-May-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and if somebody is so weak that some statement causes them irreparable harm... not sure what is best

[07-May-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but better if people can be a bit more of an adult and tolerate whatever somebody else says

[07-May-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the big deal about it anyway

[07-May-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
having to worry about everything you say, is in no way a happy way to live

[07-May-19 08:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
humans have grown weak and feeble... mere words induce general panic, self-loathing emotions and disdain towards their fellows

[07-May-19 08:09 PM] mrlynch#5735
it is no life to live indeed.. human life is too short to be preoccupied with what some random other human might think of you

[07-May-19 08:10 PM] mrlynch#5735
and on that note, we defer to Linus

It is a matter of balance. Neither absolute control nor absolute anarchy are something I would like to see. 
Also, just because someone gets offended, it does not mean the speaker is not right...

[07-May-19 08:18 PM] jansako#3330
You are right, mrlynch, at least about the UK :-). Good times = weak people, but still, do we want to see the bad times? (they will come, regardless)...

[07-May-19 08:18 PM] jansako#3330
Goodnight!

[07-May-19 08:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
there is a cycle/pattern in history: good times create weak people, weak people create bad times, bad times create strong people, strong people create good times

[07-May-19 08:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
guess where we are in the cycle, only this time we have the power of machines as well

[07-May-19 08:23 PM] mrlynch#5735

in a spectrum of possible futures, just having some non-zero chance of somebody thinking something bad that could harm someone... better safe than sorry, solitary confinement seems the most humane way to deal with such

[07-May-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so from being allow to say things, to not being allowed to think things that might lead to harming someone elses sensitivities

[07-May-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to police all possible futures!

It's easy to point, to divide, to cast, to separate. We are taught this early that things are essentially different than other things. So then down the line categorization turns in to control because origination infers onwership yes? Ah the 9/10 of the law, property.  For those who think they own things, ask yourself, at what point do you own the air you breathe? At what point do you own the water that you drink then evaporates as sweat? The food that you eat actually never touches your stomach! 
Saying people are weak or strong is easy, can you go to a house that knows no sorrow? The problems that we face will abound endlessly in different times because free will exists, attempting to smash it out will never succeed because imo you cannot kill an idea. You cannot control thought, you may influence it yet the more you squeeze you fist the more leaks from your fingers. I believe life will always strive to survive. 
Good thing is it's now, not yesterday, never will be tomorrow. Always today.
