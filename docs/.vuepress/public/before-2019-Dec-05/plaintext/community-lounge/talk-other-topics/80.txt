and who is doing the ordering

[12-May-19 08:31 AM] designer#4893
How did a free individual human create a repressive State?

[12-May-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
generally speaking, the more people concentrated leads to centralized state

[12-May-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and arbitrary rules deemed necessary to maintain the centralized control

[12-May-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
go to places with fewer people

[12-May-19 08:32 AM] nocturnal#2177
yes i agree, i think the balance between de/centralized is the key

[12-May-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
less controls (generally speaking)

[12-May-19 08:32 AM] nocturnal#2177
and which arena have central organisation and which dont is important

[12-May-19 08:33 AM] nocturnal#2177
for example finance and power should be on the decentralised spectrum. but things like health care and infrastructure creation need co-ordination to be efficient

[12-May-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why health care needs to be centralized

[12-May-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
roads yes

[12-May-19 08:34 AM] nocturnal#2177
maybe not health care but you know what i mean

[12-May-19 08:34 AM] nocturnal#2177
but health care is good have unoform level of care across society

[12-May-19 08:35 AM] nocturnal#2177

[12-May-19 08:35 AM] nocturnal#2177
and standards

[12-May-19 08:35 AM] nocturnal#2177
across society

[12-May-19 08:35 AM] nocturnal#2177
was my thinking

[12-May-19 08:35 AM] nocturnal#2177
same as education

[12-May-19 08:39 AM] nocturnal#2177
anyways.. a simple way to stop people physically stealing your crypto I think will be major thing in the future. get working on it üòÉ haha

human hates complexity. human likes simplicity.
human don't like to think. human like to just follow.

[12-May-19 08:57 AM] designer#4893
human is selfish and greedy.

[12-May-19 08:58 AM] nocturnal#2177
this is all true. the opposite is also all true

[12-May-19 09:15 AM] designer#4893
Since the public is the epitome of irresponsibility, fools who believe in democracy as learned in school should be careful and be careful.

@mrlynch wouldnt that be an insane battery drain and defeat the purpose of a mobile device?

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
they can do updates every N hours or on demand.. btc blocks are known to come rarely

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
add some pruning to it to not take up much space and it can be done.. i think

[12-May-19 10:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
maybe they also add a 10k mA battery :troll_thuglife:

[12-May-19 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But then you are not really contributing to the network is other nodes cant constantly connect to yours?

[12-May-19 10:09 AM] mrlynch#5735
it doesn't matter.. only miners secure the network anyway.. csw said so :troll:

[12-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
likely it will be headers only SPV wallet

[12-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont believe they mean full BTC node, the way it is supposed to mean

Maybe noob question, but if blocksize is 1mb for example, this does mean that this is the MAX size right?

[12-May-19 07:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So bigger blocks only a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô anyway if they are full?

[12-May-19 07:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if big blocks are already full, then reducing blocksize would just require more blocks to get tx through

[12-May-19 07:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So both have the same effect or either tx fees would just skyrocket again?

[12-May-19 07:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1) small blocks but faster blocktime
2) bigger blocks same blocktime

[12-May-19 07:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In order to avoid high tx fees

[12-May-19 07:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Both would have same effect on blockchain size
