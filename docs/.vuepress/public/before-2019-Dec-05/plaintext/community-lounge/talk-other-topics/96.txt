please ignore that criminals can easily hire people with no criminal record to do KYC

make silly rules that only make life difficult for non-criminals, dont affect the criminals at all, but as a side effect lets the electronic police state monitor every move you make

Yes it feels that way, more about absolute control by a few, like it's happening in China. And I think many other countries would love that too. But also the "algorithms" they use seem to be really badly done, I mean if you read the reviews on TrustPilot customers are constantly getting their accounts frozen, real horror stories by people who sound totally innocent. 
This is an example with N26, but there are similar ones for all banks or mobile banks:

N26 is rated "Bad" with 2.9 / 10 on Trustpilot

If facebook tries to act like a nation state, then other companies will launch a competitor to libra.

If there are multiple libras, then the threat of freezing your bank account stops being effective for controlling people.

Who knows what will happen. I believe it's a distraction. Libra might be able to reach more users but Bitcoin will remain the largest threat to the banking system

I guess they fear organized companies more than they do semi-organized crypto projects.

[23-Jun-19 01:47 AM] PTYX#6840
Their gov's reaction to the libra coin seems to me like they know something that we don't. It's possible that people in the inner circles of finance know already the power that those corporations already have and are fearful of what they could do with a cryptocurrency outside of the central banking system

While Facebook's Libra doesn't compete against any open, public, permissionless, borderless, neutral, censorship-resistant blockchains, it *will* compete against both retail banks and central banks. This is going to be fun to watch.

content addressable files protocol, auto identity protocol, bitcoin data protocol, etc. are being created. the important thing is that the base protocol must be stable in order for the layer at the application level to be applied. so the lockup of the protocol is very important.

protocols should be stable without arbitrary change while maintaining scalability.

"Stay hungry, stay foolish" means continuation of meaningful life. 

It's hard to be hungry when you're wealthy.
It's hard to be foolish because success makes you feel smart.

Computers have become cheap.
In the past only rich people could learn to program.
Now time is the limiting factor, not money.
The next generation of great programmers will be from South Asia, Latin America, and Africa, not Europe or USA.

Do you think a coin will be more valuable if it backed by a big company?

[26-Jun-19 03:50 PM] PTYX#6840
@nancysb Komodo has a company in Hochimin if I'm not mistaken.

[26-Jun-19 03:51 PM] PTYX#6840
An entity or something that represents its interests. I'm not 100% on the dets.

a long, short time if 7 months is long. I dare say that the next year is a time to study and judge each other's minds. It's where the next 1-2 years will decide our future.

Bitcoin -> Altcoin, the order is still valid. 
The final winner will not be out of the picture until 2020. 
In the meantime, radical sell is a dangerous choice.

It's going to be a tough fight. It has to be really powerful. need to be cool-headed rather than optimistic.

Fibonacci number
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
