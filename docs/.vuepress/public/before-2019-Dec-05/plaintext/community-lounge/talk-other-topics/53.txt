Will people really spend $70-$700 to open/modify a lightning channel when there's an Altcoin down the street which will process a (USD-denominated) payment for $0.05 ?

Many people seem to think yes but honestly I just don't get it

```A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The   problem   with   this   solution   is   that   the   fate   of   the   entire   money   system   depends   on   the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.```

bitcoin itself has to maintain maximum dispersion to survive in hostile environments, so practical use comes with a number of constraints. By taking side chains and utilizing the diversity of large blockchain ecosystem without fundamental modification of bitcoin codes, Bitcoin core developers claim that practicality can be secured. they are also well aware that, after all, all blockchain can be side chains for each other.

If a number of ecosystems using blockchain are connected together to form a jungle, will the jungle be horizontal? 
Bitcoin core developers's answer to this question is empirical. 
In state of nature, as long as the one-to-one network of relationships with hubs is centered, radial structures are the cheapest. 
then it would be a question for investors of cryptocurrency to find out what the jungle hub of blockchain would be.
