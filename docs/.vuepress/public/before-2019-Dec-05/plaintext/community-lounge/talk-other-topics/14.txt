[16-Aug-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it increases usage of KMD and that is really all that is important in the long run, all attempts at locking people into paying fees, just wont work, this is open source. anything that locks people in will just obsolete itself. only if people actually use a currency will it have real value. usage, usage, usage

In my opinion, since a decentralized exchange is suitable for transactions between cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency ecosystem must be expanded deeply for a successful decentralized exchange. when the ecosystem is deepened, people can obtain cryptocurrency in a variety of ways, by providing services and goods to nearby neighbors. once any form of cryptocurrency is available, it can be exchanged for the desired other cryptocurrency through a decentralized exchange.

If this is the case, the government will no longer be able to control the cryptocurrency in the way of pressure on centralized exchange. from the point of view of the authorities it is better for the authorities to nurture centralized exchange and let people stay in centralized exchange with the central server.

for the same reason, i think regulators don't will issue dollarcoin or eurocoin, because maybe government could lose control of money completely.

cryptocurrency exchange is the gateway and power of the world of cryptocurrency. If Facebook, Google, and Starbucks are not interested in the cryptocurrency exchange business, that's more bizarre.

many users mean the formation of large communities, and community formation is the key to money creation. after all, huge social media such as Facebook and portals such as Google are independently committed to creating currency like bitcoin. therefore, cryptocurrency exchange is a strategic point that must be secured in order to create an independent coin.

Google's move to build its own blockchain is no longer a secret. Vitalic, an etherium developer, said Google had approached him to build its own blockchain platform.

Platform, which is an independent blockchain, technically overlaps with its own cryptocurrency. "If Google, Twitter, and Facebook make their own cryptocurrency, it will become huge because of the user base they already have." said Philip Snow, CEO of British investment company Blackmore Group. 
given the fact that two billion people are the usual means of payment, the social networking services dinosaurs' own money could challenge the status of dollars or yuan at once. In fact, Facebook tried a project called Facebook Credit, but it had been frustrated.

"cryptocurrency" led by dinosaurs also has an advantage in gaining public trust rather than "bitcoin," which leadership difficult to find. bitcoin has problems with governance, such as failing to solve problems such as capacity expansion over the years.

[17-Aug-18 09:13 AM] designer#4893
there is no governance problem with Google, Facebook, or the coins that Goldman Sachs will create or lead. strong governance can respond immediately to various crises and system failures. 
also, it is more convenient to use them in everyday life because the price of the trusted global companies is more stable than the government agnostic money. 
spread of cryptocurrency led by Internet dinosaurs will be fast, as leadership deficient cryptocurrency such as bitcoin from trials and errors can be omitted.

success of governance cryptocurrency could cause bitcoin prices to fall or even fail. but there is another possibility. importance of bitcoin can be highlighted while companies are building exclusive blocks and fighting to make their own cryptocurrency into the online world's key currency. bitcoin is best for the role of mediating mutually exclusive monetary blocks. bitcoin is value neutral for a particular currency because it has no governance. that is why bitcoin can become a key currency that connects different monetary communities.

Is the Bancor decentralized exchange?

In fact, general public, and even ordinary investors, are not interested in philosophical debate over distributed system. they pursue both safety and convenience. even if they are contradictory attributes. 

smart contract is never convenient. a convenient contract is to sign the customer agreement of a large company. large company themselves provide trust and they can be held accountable when problems arise. 

however, the more convenient the contract, the greater the variation between the parties. so, the information and authority side can unilaterally change the contract. advocates of bitcoin view money as a product of contract. bills issued by the central bank are contracts between the state and citizens, but countries with strong information and authority change contracts from time to time.

since the smart contract uses the attributes of the blockchain, it can not be changed and the contract is executed by the system itself. the contract is fulfilled even in situations where it is difficult to believe the elements outside the system, such as courts, police, and prisons.

bitcoin is a smart contract currency, expressed in codes that can not change the issue amount, issue rate, and issuance method. not only are those who can read the code attesting to this fact, but the fact that bitcoin have endured 10 years in a hostile environment gives them faith. however, not all smart contracts have been validated for a long time as bitcoin.

In fact, hacking incidents involving loopholes in smart contacts continue to take place. It is due to the inevitable gap in knowledge. hackers are digging into the blind spots of codes that the public as well as developers do not understand.

'Smart Contract' needs to solve three problems

what service should be complemented to spread uncomfortable smartcontracts? 
this question is also to predict the development of cryptocurrency ecosystem. three tasks are key. 

first, smartcontract code should be reviewed to see if it represents the business contents correctly. this is because ordinary people do not understand the programming language that is driven in the blockchain.

second, a laboratory testing the resistance of the code is also needed. just as you are clinically testing new drugs for limited patients, you can run your code on a closed network and look for code loopholes from a hacker's perspective. VeChain and HackenProof utilize collective intelligence to test their code for immunity in a way that gives rewards to hackers hacking smartcontracts codes. 

finally, it is necessary to seal the code until launching. despite code that has been verified with time and money can be modulated just before the signature.

In the world of cryptocurrency, a moderate form of leadership is essential. but in order for someone to have the power to take action in an emergency, like Bancor, programmers should create a secret door called a backdoor.

the problem is that hackers are after the backdoor itself. bitcoin advocates are adamantly resisting building up their leadership, remembering that the oldest hacker is a government that claims to be the savior of a crisis and keeps a secret door.
