If the government allows financial institutions to deal with bitcoin, it is highly likely that it is money laundering. Bitcoin should be legalized right now only to ignore other factors and prevent money laundering.

Someone just did a lot of work producing an invalid block. The miner rewarded 13.26546691 BTC to itself instead of 12.5, so it was rejected from the network. This is why we run full nodes.

"A new report by the American Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) says the US‚Äô geopolitical adversaries are deploying blockchain technology to help avoid sanctions and counter US financial power.

According to the FDD, with the increase of adoption of cryptocurrencies around the world, efforts are underway to build new systems for transferring value that work outside of conventional banking infrastructure.
Governments in Russia, China, Iran, and Venezuela are experimenting with the technology that underpins the crypto market, said the report. They are prioritizing blockchain technology as a¬†‚Äúkey component of their efforts to counter US financial power.‚Äù RT News

Bitcoin is not a pyramid of fraud as conventions are conceived. Nor does it promise a romantic cyber utopia that naive idealists expect. Rather, it is likely to be transformed into a means of imperialism through stages of commercialization and regulation. And now these signals are occurring. However, it is only caught by noise and is not attracted attention.

financial companies are not properly aware that financial hegemony will be transferred to global digital platforms due to bitcoin. Idealists in the blockchain community who cry for decentralization seem to be mired in their own world. Investors and scammers who entered the market for one-pocket money only seek to make money, but are not interested in the mid- to long-term development of the industry in the first place.

[13-Jul-19 07:54 AM] designer#4893
It is true that bitcoin faced several crises, such as when government regulations on digital assets were tightened, when altcoin, including eth, emerged and threatened bitcoin's status, when bitcoin became a hard fork, resulting in the creation of a payment-specialized bitcoin cache. but bitcoin's vitality was strong. like hydra, where more throats rise when the neck is cut off, bitcoin rather became stronger every time it went through hardships. there will continue to be incidents that will put bitcoin at risk in the future, but I think bitcoin will survive in the future and prove its tenacious vitality. 
(the next crisis will be the stable coin published by governments and global companies. but even this will not overthrow bitcoin.)

President Trump is right to say that cryptocurrencies have no fundamental value, writes Brett Arends.

You're shocked that a guy whose career revolves around writing for the WSJ and about the Dow doesn't like crypto, right?

It is a wake-up call to those who are obsessed with any ideal of blockchain. Idealists seem to have no doubt as they believe they can decentralize power with a blockchain and make society transparent. but to put it coolly, decentralized is Utopia. It can never be realized. It may seem desirable, but it is a very unlikely concept to be realized. communism, which dreamed of equality for all, and democracy, which was aimed at national sovereignty, have both failed or degenerated. blockchain is said to bring out the moldy concept of decentralization to ensure censorship resistance, transparent society and privacy. however, the decentralized philosophy of blockchain has been undermined, and the once idealists are turning into extremely realistic merchants who roll the abacus. all these predictions are based on human history.

privacy. It's a very important concept. however, people are not as sophisticated as they thought they would be in protecting their privacy. this is because the convenience of services in return for privacy is too great. In china, which is becoming an advanced country in digital finance, citizens are giving up privacy and receiving high-quality financial services. If such a step is made, it is predicted that a submissive newcomer who will leave privacy to the nation and post it on Instagram after receiving the first grade in social credit rating will appear.

How a quantum computer could break 2048-bit RSA encryption in 8 hours
A new study shows that quantum technology will catch up with today‚Äôs encryption standards much sooner than expected. That should worry anybody who needs to store data securely for 25 years or so.

This is amazing. Huawei quality. Remember, backdoors are unnecessary when your firmware is a pile of CVEs.
