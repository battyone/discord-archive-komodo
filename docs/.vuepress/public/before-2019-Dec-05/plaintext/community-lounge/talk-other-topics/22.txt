serious question: is it possible to disable GPS/Mic/Cam hardware on Google Pixel phone ?

[04-Oct-18 09:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
im sure it wouldnt be too hard to open it up and remove said components

[04-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty sure some company in aus sells "hardened" versions of them with that special kernel

[04-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
and gps mic cam removed

[04-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
so wouldnt be impossible

for pixel, copperhead was good until it had constant updates pushed to it by it's main dev.

[04-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since the main dev is no more with copperhead, that os is in weird state

[04-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the update keys deleted by main dev as he had that control

[04-Oct-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to happen to all the good ones these days... must get paid off lol

[04-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so there is no new updates since then

[04-Oct-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
some controversy etc. haven't looked into it much

[04-Oct-18 09:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in any case, I'll just turn to stock android os for pixel 3

i've been wanting one for so long but it hurts my soul to pay over 500$ for a cellphone.

[05-Oct-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@PTYX u cant use apps like uber, watsapp, google apps like google maps, but I don‚Äôt need them on my Android really. For email client it has k-9 email. Not pretty, but a nerdy cool. Netflix, prime like apps I haven‚Äôt tried
Silence, conversations are best replacement for watsapp or telegram 
Sygic with subscriptions is best as alt maps, but I still missed google maps a lot on it.

[05-Oct-18 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Copperhead is not getting any updates for some long time now

[05-Oct-18 02:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If I need to get updates from copperhead I will have to send the phone to ncrypt ro update again. Maybe wash and reinstall fresh os. Free of charge I guess. But I heard it‚Äôs not getting as good or enough updates as it was getting with it‚Äôs original dev.

[05-Oct-18 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So will see what I will fo with it. Thinking of keeping this android as is, and replace my iPhone with new pixel 3.
