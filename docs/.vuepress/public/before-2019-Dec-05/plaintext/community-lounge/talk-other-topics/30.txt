Good work from @AlethioEthstats. As they point out, the fact that EOS had massive outflows from the crowdsale contract DURING THE SALE is hugely problematic. Why did they depart from the established best practice and do this?

all along I have assumed that EOS used ICO funds to purchase more ICO and open market on the exchanges. It is possible that the total actual ETH raised is much less than $4 bil. consider this was mostly during bear market, how could each day EOS selling out at such high levels?

[28-Oct-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
one way is to just take the first 5 days amount raised and recycle it every day to buy whatever unsold amount of the 2 million lot
