Can't agree more!
I started with a Go based web app for Rogue
found what I needed to code to make it run in web page via web terminal 
Maybe I should have just coded the half-working solution
There is a problem which is one of the core feature of Go language, Concurancey. I didn't get that well clearly understood. Spent another week+ reading books and watching video. Understood that to good part, now doing exercise making that issue coded and confirm if it's working.
In my head I'm doing exactly what you saying, but if you mean I should code a code for public testing and use, I'm not going there yet, since I'm focusing on learning first instead of making a sample or something for someone to use.

[24-Mar-19 09:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
C language learning is a side-learning activity, it's Go language what I'm focusing on more

[24-Mar-19 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since I'm totally moving away from JavaScript world.

[24-Mar-19 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Coded so far 3 projects with this project, 
Partial parts of BitcoinDark Desktop app, years ago, well before Komodo was born , the SuperNET days
Iguana Wallet, the codebase from where Agama Wallet was evolved to what it is today
BarterDEX GUI - the one I proud of, and kinda dislike at the same time too, since it's all JavaScript and the headaches it gave me while coding it.

[24-Mar-19 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't wish to code any other project in JavaScript, so I'm on pause on any other activity here

[24-Mar-19 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
until I get my understanding clear on my Go code and make example codes

I'm pretty new at messing with programming languages, mostly mess with R, Python, and some other db stuff. One thing that has been a challenge is with my classes, they never teach you how to set up your own environment on your computer. Everything is assumed you will be walking into an established setup.

[25-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Regnar#6164
Like when should you be using VMs, how to set up paths, what's good practice for breaking up code. Basically I would make little things and realize I could break them apart into smaller pieces to make it less complicated, or going through githubs and looking at how people write their code.

[25-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Regnar#6164
Also running into a bunch of issues where the things I need (or think I need) aren't supported for windows, that's fun.

[25-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Regnar#6164
so now I'm looking around at linux based systems for my laptop that will be good for me to practice programming and still have ability to do work related stuff (excel, word, powerpoint, etc)

[25-Mar-19 04:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Ok, I am probably am going to get flamed for this, but here goes. Windows is pretty much the only system that will give you "issues", unless you are working with Microsoft tools; basically Visual Studio which comes with a fancy .msi installer takes care of most things for you and you are pretty much stuck with the .NET family of languages. For everything else - Python, Ruby, JS, etc, etc., you are going to need the  Linux subsystem, which will make life a lot easier, but still will be horrible. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Now, personally, I'd say if you have to resources is to either get a Mac (a BSD under the hood) or go Linux. If you have never used Linux, I think the experience to work in it for your development will make you a better programmer, administrator and a better power user. Languages such as Python thrive when running under a Unix-like environment. Work "related" stuff can easily be done with alternatives, but I can understand your fear for crossing over. That's why there is something called dual-boot ;)

Also these "missing classes" are often best practices and nine of ten times, a quick google gets you far; its the hacker way.

If you go Linux, I personally love Debian-like distro's, where Ubuntu is probably the most care free for you.

I haven't used Mac too much but my current laptop is still pretty good quality so I don't plan on switching anytime soon, I'm thinking Linux based is probably the route to go, and yea, I've been pretty much looking up everything as I go. Duckduckgo has been awesome with all the stack overflow best answers right in the browser.

[25-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Regnar#6164
I haven't really thought about the dual boot option, I'll have to look into it. I have seen a few of the things like libreoffice, but there's also online based Microsoft office, worst case.

[25-Mar-19 05:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Actually, consider an online option, like Google Docs. Unless you really need office for "work", go Office 365, they have the genuine office stuff too (at a cost). LibreOffice is pretty awful, actually. On Mac, just go for Pages/Numbers/etc. and there is Office for Mac.

[25-Mar-19 05:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(also, operating systems are personal preferences... just stick with what keeps you productive)

[25-Mar-19 05:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I haven't tried LibreOffice yet but it seems pretty hard to beat the MS office stuff.

[25-Mar-19 05:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, Google's docs is pretty awesome. Office is ancient.

[25-Mar-19 05:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Change is inevitable.

[25-Mar-19 05:17 AM] Regnar#6164
lol I do not see it that way, Google docs has been a pita

[25-Mar-19 05:18 AM] Regnar#6164
but, none of these barriers seem impossible to overcome haha

[25-Mar-19 05:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
In what sense?

[25-Mar-19 05:20 AM] Regnar#6164
Mostly the slides imo. The sheets are getting much better especially with pulling web data (excel is pretty crap at it) though now I just do it in python and save to CSV so maybe less relevant

[25-Mar-19 05:20 AM] Regnar#6164
can't say anything bad about word or google docs, kinda hard to mess those up

[25-Mar-19 05:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

So if the only thing I can think of that is Windows specific is the MS Office Suite, it seems it would be fine to just run MS Office Online while using Ubuntu for OS? my criteria are programmer friendly, lightweight (since it's a laptop), privacy minded, touch screen capable, I don't really play heavy games, crypto friendly, and have to be able to do excel/word/powerpoint type stuff for work.

In fairness, it's not like BU was going to be `too closely associated with the Bitcoin community`, so that they fall to one side or the other of 2 guys having a dick-swinging contest isn't all that meaningful, is it?

That combined with the irony that his reason for leaving is confusing in and of itself.
One of the organizers of BU/SV conferences is quitting because BU is "associated"  with SV?
