old time hand voting and law creation must be changed with internet democracy and forum-like law creation, then we see as democracy 3.0, but tools not yet ready: internet voting, superior forum engines, digital identity / maybe all needs crypto and decentralization

[04-Jun-18 04:58 PM] passcombo.com#0000
when all tools ready = we dont need politicians -> only ideas + voting. But we do need managers / officers to manage country. But then we can change them frequently since law creation will be totally separate from governance managers.

so "freedom of press" as long as they are closely monitored and punished for any statements against the state?

state and their friends

[05-Jun-18 12:57 AM] smk762#0000
a subset of "freedom", monitored for compliance, and revoked if in breach. Every time I walk past a tv, the 'home of the brave' is doing some paranoid authoritarian bs. Dissonance thrives.

The short selling market, which artificially moves stock prices and makes money, is an ecosystem in which financial companies, thousands of brokers and various pension fund foundations are intertwined. they are small, but they are strong enough to form a strong interest group. blockchain securities platform is the wall to cross.

[05-Jun-18 04:51 AM] toycrane#0000
It is important that the CEO, who is openly antipathetic to the U.S. financial industry, is working with regulators such as the SEC itself. The regulators are joining the project that could shake the foundation of the traditional financial industry. It is a change that was unlikely to be possible just a year ago.

important and not rewarded

[05-Jun-18 02:06 PM] 1stormingj#0000
Not with a measurable unit, but the removal of trust and ability to validate your money is it's own reward

[05-Jun-18 02:07 PM] 1stormingj#0000
And nodes not being rewarded for validating is a big concession from "non-mining nodes don't matter"

[05-Jun-18 02:10 PM] emmanux#0000
electrum servers could implement some little fee to maintain their service up, and clients could implement a validation of electrum servers to only work with those that have their p2p open to the world (full nodes).

[05-Jun-18 02:10 PM] emmanux#0000
win-win-win

[05-Jun-18 02:13 PM] 1stormingj#0000
Sure, but the cost of running a full node is so more or less free rendering such a service redundant

[05-Jun-18 02:13 PM] 1stormingj#0000
HDD space and the bandwith required to sync and maintain the chain is marginal

[05-Jun-18 02:18 PM] emmanux#0000
you sure? I think it consumes a lot of traffic quota.

[05-Jun-18 02:19 PM] emmanux#0000
storage is not that much, sure, but bandwidth... not sure.

[05-Jun-18 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#0000
if enouhg people had nodes, bandwidth would be low. I havent opened my BTC node up, but all my KMD assets + game uses very little.

[05-Jun-18 02:32 PM] emmanux#0000
well, egg or chicken? I think that more rewards = more open nodes.

[05-Jun-18 02:33 PM] emmanux#0000
if there were incentive for open to p2p electrum servers, there would be an exponential grow.

<@U66SWTM47> I suppose that depends on where you live and what kind of capacity you have, but I'm currently on copper cabling using a mediocre, below national average connection (admittedly in a first world country) and have no issues maintaining my node while also using and sharing the internet with several others

[05-Jun-18 03:21 PM] 1stormingj#0000
And because bitcoin actually has a blocksize and peer limit, there's not expected growth in these variables, so it stands to reason it will continue to be more accessible in time

[05-Jun-18 03:50 PM] passcombo.com#0000
I got enough energy. I also tried everything in life waht was supposed to bring me happy. And it all failed 😛

[05-Jun-18 03:52 PM] passcombo.com#0000
Most things we do in ealry life is repeating what other people do - by assumption that if other get temporary satisfaction - we should also get it. Sometimes for some people it works. But not for all.

[05-Jun-18 03:55 PM] passcombo.com#0000
Only source of hope I found is following those guys who teach "no-mind" 🙂 , and claim they got full satisfaction in life. Some way it make sense  what they say (we all deeply identify with mind which is a tool for solving problems, not a tool for happiness), but it's more like a gift from life if you ever get 100% self-realisation, then sth you can achieve.

[05-Jun-18 03:57 PM] passcombo.com#0000

"Blockchain backed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and ZenCash, are built on a “proof-of-work” system. That means that the network goes along with what a majority of ‘nodes’ (or miners) say is true. It’s a secure system because to trick it, you need to control more than half of those nodes, or an equivalent amount of computing power."

How is it possible to have an idea of the amount of lost coins ?

[06-Jun-18 03:41 PM] 1stormingj#0000
There have been a couple of articles discussing the idea, it depends why you assume they're lost. Some estimations believe X% of coins that having moved in a certain period of time are statistically likely to be lost, there's a few hundred thousand believed to be owned by Satoshi that are 'lost', there are some quantities publicly acknowledged as lost and other known quantities that have been intentionally lost/destroyed/otherwise been made inaccessible
