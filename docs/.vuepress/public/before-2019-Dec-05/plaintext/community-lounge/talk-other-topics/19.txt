I can probably order multiple for some friends should that help keep costs down?

[18-Sep-18 02:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or lower cost a piece

[18-Sep-18 02:42 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I can ship you more than once at the same price, they're light and can fit in box

[18-Sep-18 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, keep me posted!

[18-Sep-18 02:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I just ordered a new one with modifications, once I get the design right I will make a large order

I don't know about "vastly superior", but as @MashuriBC said they are not mutually exclusive.

This guy is paranoid:

[22-Sep-18 05:43 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
"I always feared that someone from the bankster circles, someone injected into the Bitcoin development circles with the sole goal of wreaking unsalvageable havoc, would do exactly what happened."

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think he is being paranoid

[22-Sep-18 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
removing the check for duplicate inputs is essentially allowing a double spend to happen. if a 1000 BTC utxo is duplicated, you get an extra 1000 BTC created

"the best developers in the world" made this change and had it live for 2 years, before BCH dev found it and reported it responsibly

The error may be valid, but believing banks join forces, and make one employee to secretrly destroy btc making such bug is paranoid to me

[22-Sep-18 09:56 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
there are better ways for destroying btc, like making another crypto, making popular and fully centralized

[22-Sep-18 09:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
beside banks not really interested much in this space (except exceptions)

[22-Sep-18 09:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and why destroy sth you may profit ? üòÉ counter logic

[22-Sep-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but the entire bitcoin core devs were bought and paid for...

[22-Sep-18 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
who financed blockstream?

[22-Sep-18 01:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if banks financed them then if they wished BTC to fail they would not finance it at all; I believe in more simple solutions (like bug is either a mistake; I waould believe in a purpose bug is someone directly makes money on it), but maybe Im wrong

The platforms we use to interact with blockchains are nowhere near secure enough‚Äîand bad actors are taking advantage of it.
