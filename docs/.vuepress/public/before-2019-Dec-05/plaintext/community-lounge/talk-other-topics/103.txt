I've just been asked by a fairly new privacy coin project called PRiVCY (PRIV) if I can list them on the privacy tech directory I have. 
But I never heard of them before, would be great to have some opinions here.
They are a POS/POW hybrid privacy coin with tor routing
They are on CMC and also on Coingecko.
The explorer on their site doesn't work, it shows a blank page, while the explorer for their coin on blockexperts.com works.
Let me know what you think

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/privcy/

[26-Jul-19 06:59 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
IMO using Tor isn't anything special, any coin do that
stealth addresses ok but not unique
~30% of total supply under team control seems too high...

In fact, it is a little difficult to tax Bitcoin under the existing national taxation system. When there is a need to exchange cash after using a personal key, the user can inform the individual key through 1:1 OTC transaction and receive cash. This method eliminates the need to pay taxes on bitcoin transfers/transfers.

I believe that the central bank's CBDC issuance is an attempt to tax the transfer/transfer/use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency by eventually creating a paperless world, in which records are traced to the digital world 'when electronic currency from the central bank and bitcoin are exchanged.' That's why the IMF also said, 'The electronicization of paper money can happen sooner than you think.'

Now it seems like a piece of facts, but in the end, a piece of the puzzle is coming together to make a picture. 
I feel that the world is changing too fast.
