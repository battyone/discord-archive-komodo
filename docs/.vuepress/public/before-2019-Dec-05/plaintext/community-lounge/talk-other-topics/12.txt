[29-Jul-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so i am fairly confident in my prediction being correct

[29-Jul-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
what that means is whatever liquidity telegrams bring to crypto, BTC will share in it. so like in any market, all new competitors end up helping the market leader by doing anything in that market

[29-Jul-18 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So in the end when a telegram is succesful at bringing mass adoption to the space that this will reflect on the rest of the cryptosphere as well?

[29-Jul-18 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems hard to avoid pulling bTC along and with that, the alts too

[29-Jul-18 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the thought originally come to me as I live on cryptocurrency for daily living.
I understand that not every day and time remains same always.
today we can consider btc up from it's starting years, but can we consider it greater in value for sure in coming years?
same goes to the holdings of eth, kmd etc. etc.

[29-Jul-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
first of all nothing is "for sure"

[29-Jul-18 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that happens like the existing long term holdings goes down in a decade etc 
what should be my backup strategy etc?

[29-Jul-18 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
rebalance annually with the "liquidity holdings", the part of the portfolio that is in BTC

[29-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
say 50% in BTC (or the #1), then 16% in the 2, 3, 4th

[29-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but only after BTC dominance is below 20%

[29-Jul-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, any new comer will be in the 4th rank for one year and then as it goes 10x, you end up with more than having had just BTC

[29-Jul-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
of course it can happen pretty fast, so whenever there is some "external" crypto that has all the right stuff, start shifting some bTC into it. likely it will be hard to miss this process happening

[29-Jul-18 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, in that case I need to switch to btc and eth some for sure üòÑ

[29-Jul-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you need to have a liquidity portion of your portfolio that is only about liquiidity, 10% to 30%

[29-Jul-18 09:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right....

[29-Jul-18 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
how does the future of BCH looks like?

[29-Jul-18 09:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still hodl some.... and thinking to move it's half value to eth

[29-Jul-18 09:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for your advice James. always helpful. üôÇ

[29-Jul-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is one of the top liquidity coins

[29-Jul-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that gives it a long life just from network effect, but it is mostly from trading, not usage

[29-Jul-18 09:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see what I have from the top list:
btc
eth
bch
ltc
iota
etc
zec
sc
stratis
kmd
vrsc

[29-Jul-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
maybe it's already fine as is... but still will move some value to eth

[29-Jul-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
