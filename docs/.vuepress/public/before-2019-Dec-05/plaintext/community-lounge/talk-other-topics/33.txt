@jl777c @blackjok3r since request to get details getting lost in mining conversion about ZEX in #zexo channel can anyone explain how z DeX hybrid thing works, or will work?

Yeahhhhh, up till reading the above few comments, I was having hard time understanding  this zex thing. Their webpage, white paper, ANN page, not much actually info of what/how. So to summarize zex is an exchange using colored coins spun up by CC with possible barterdex backend integration in next year?

[13-Nov-18 04:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
barterdex is Atomic Swaps tech.
Zaddex is Crypto Conditons Smart Contract based On-chain DEX, like NXT Assetchain has been.

[13-Nov-18 04:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
based on Assets Crypto-Conditions Smart Contract and Gateway Crypto Conditions Smart contract

[13-Nov-18 04:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
combination of these two CC makes better proxy-token based DEX than any other DEX in industry.

[13-Nov-18 04:38 PM] joe2x4#5987
Thanks. That description is a mouthful but better than anything I could gleam from official sources.

Just got 2 1tb Samsung 970s for my PC to put in raid, those are not super fast like the optanes but for the price I think they are the best ones out there that you can actually use, at a point faster is just waste of money for 99% of tasks.

Along with 2x 8tb WD reds, for 18tb storage :O
