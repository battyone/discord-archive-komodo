Hi everyone. 

After more than 4 months of trying to have BAY listed on the OEX exchange, we have had to concede to the fact that they have stolen our listing fee and will not be listing us. 
We have tried many times to get an exact date of listing and each time there has been a delay with various excuses.
Knowing we have had 3 BTC stolen which could have been spent on marketing or put towards another exchange listing is very frustrating. We will look into legal options to try and recover the fees, as long as it isn’t too expensive of course.
Please feel free to share this news on social media or other chats, and let’s help to make sure no other projects are scammed into losing money from this exchange.

[21-May-19 09:07 PM] vicmao#2684
Beware of OEX exchnge... BitBay paíd a listing fee, haven't been listed and they don't Payback It back. I'm a Komodo holder and a BitBay holder too. 
I just wanted to let you know and warn you.

Reading this makes me think, what ever value of 1 $BTC or any other cryptocurrency to a $1000,000 (million), or $1000,000,000 (billion) or whatever fiat currency might be in future, would it even be worth it at that point? We're better using cryptocurrency for services now...

Financial Position

Strong operating margin & balance sheet -- new products/services & additional strategic acquisitions

Volume is driven by volatility -- revenue opportunity in both increasing & declining markets

Easy expansion -- this leading execution platform can readily add additional financial services & products for the blockchain & crypto space

so at least you can see what kind of multiplier they are using for their 4bn valuation and you can look at some benchmarks

[22-May-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810

[22-May-19 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah that's what I'm thinking as well

[22-May-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
they only want "take my money" type of investors

[22-May-19 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
at least it is a bit better than IEO

[22-May-19 04:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
also you need to be an accredited investor - meaning you have too much money to worry about loosing some in this pitch  if you decide to invest 😄

[22-May-19 05:25 PM] Regnar#6164
I would assume you can get some financials by signing up through the site. While I'm all for investing in exchanges as a different method of exposure in the crypto space, I'm hesitant with that offering. I'd rather build my own 😛

$BCH 51% attacked by unknown attacker trying "steal" segwit coins. https://t.co/LvE0NV4YZM and https://t.co/VZPCkF6M11 then reorged and took the coins themselves to distribute them to "rightful owners" which seems rather impossible.

they used to have a specific restriction from spending it, but i guess in the recent hardfork they removed that restriction for some reason
