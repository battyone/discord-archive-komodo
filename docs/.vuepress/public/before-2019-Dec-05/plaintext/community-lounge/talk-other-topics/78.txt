Global financial companies that are trying to issue stable coins are well aware that blockchain is transforming financial innovation from zero-sum games to positive-sum games.

[08-May-19 04:09 PM] designer#4893
stable coin itself seems to have no special advantage other than that it is a quick micropayment. but if the blockchain eventually becomes the foundation of the global supply chain, the stable coin will play a crucial role in turning the supply chain into a huge financial network. stable coins, which are reliably exchanged for dollars or yen, are essential as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a collateral for credit in a blockchain supply chain.

[08-May-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
fiat backed stablecoins have the big advantage in that the issuer can simply collect the interest on deposits and if they just are transparent about the deposits, people are happy

[08-May-19 04:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what does that mean @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢

[08-May-19 04:14 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Cryptoon It means that people seem to be massively misinformed about bech addys because of adoption

[08-May-19 04:19 PM] designer#4893
another variable called blockchain appeared in the fierce game board spread among dinosaurs, and is changing the rules. the reason banks are paying attention to stable coin is because they expect blockchain to regain its leadership by using its influence on financial innovation.

of course, IT companies, not banks, can participate in financial innovation with blockchain as a weapon. however, issuing a stable coin that is linked to the dollar or yen requires a number of deposit accounts to be legally secured. otherwise, they will have to go through a banking network again in the process of collecting paper money from selling the staple coin, and it is uncertain whether the government will give them permission. If it is a bank, it is enough just to exchange the balance of the bank into a stable coin.

shares or real estate registrations of coded companies in blockchain are split up like tokens. shipped agricultural products, wine that has been bottled, and tuna caught are tokenized, which can be sold to an unspecified number of investors. at the same time that all assets are capitalised, the liquidity of all capital is immediately possible. another name for the blockchain is the trust network. In the end, blockchain dramatically increases the size of credit.

[08-May-19 04:22 PM] designer#4893
the real power of blockchain is the ability to monetize all assets.

if you meant about the tx comment, most bitcoin clients are programmed by default to not accept transactions that pay 0 fee (in fact if you try to broadcast it through most explorers it will get kicked back as "invalid")

fees growing 40x, and the peg is still not holding. maybe because the interest doesnt go to the holder of the coins, but just as profits to the makerdao. also calling something that has some committee making arbitrary decisions a "DAO" is not right. it isnt fully automated, certainly isnt decentralized
