The organization's mandates are:

To foster competing implementations of the Bitcoin protocol in order to provide more choice to node operators and to add robustness to the network.
To support the continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system as described in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper [PDF].

$VBK is gonna precipitate some fun stuff from the #Bitcoin maximalist zealots:
args for permissioning OP_RETURN
soul searching about what chainspam is
no more "short #altcoins to 0" gloating

[26-Mar-19 08:33 PM] PHBA2061#2530
This is the first IEO offered by bittrex, but on binance launchpad there were already 3 IEO with 3x return, people are going crazy over this new IEO trend.

[26-Mar-19 08:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah that the only reason I would buy it

[26-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Buy - wait for pump by platform - dump

[26-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because its massively inferior to dpow

you have to be very fast though, last time I tried on binance, the IEO was sold out just after several second.

We are excited to announce that Bittrex International will host an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) of VeriBlock's VBK coin beginning at 9:00am PDT (4:00pm UTC) on April 2. VeriBlock and its novel Proof-of-Proof ("PoP") consensus protocol is the first and only technology in the world to allow any blockchain to inherit Bitcoin's unprecedented thermodynamic Proof-of-Work security in an entirely Decentralized, Trustless, Transparent and Permissionless ("DTTP") manner.

[26-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Markus#5464
hm ü§î

[26-Mar-19 09:54 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I found this answer by the admin of VeriBlock's Discord 
`i can answer that somewhat.  KMD implemented dPoW which is similar in concept to VBK's PoP mining except that the difference is the function of submitting merkle roots to bitcoin's chain is distributed and decentralized in VBK's infrastructure to PoP miners (anyone can start PoP mining).  For KMD, they elect 64 "notary" nodes annually in February, that perform a similar function to a PoP miner by grabbing KMD's merkle root at 10 minute intervals and submitting it to bitcoin's chain.  The part which makes it kind of centralized is that KMD rewards their notary nodes for performing that function by allowing notary nodes to mine PoW blocks on an easy difficulty, such that 75% of the blocks are mined and rewarded to a notary node whereas only 25% go to GPU miners.  The problem with this, is that their election for each years notary nodes is dependent upon which candidates get the most amount of vote tokens.  Their vote tokens are handed out at a 1:1 ratio to the holders of KMD.  So you get the existing notary nodes getting the majority of the block rewards (KMD coin) and they also end up with the majority of the vote tokens every year.  So obviously they will keep voting themselves in.

From an altchain perspective, KMD also has a yearly fee that they charge to each altchain for performing this "notary" service.  Essentially that notary service is the same as what PoP miners are already doing.`

[26-Mar-19 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The biggest difference is the 3x cost in BTC of VBK and  100x+ more tx on the BTC chain

[26-Mar-19 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
also mining rewards are a small fraction of 5% APR, so their delusion that notaries making 20,000 KMD per year can vote themselves in when it takes 1 million+ to get elected makes no sense

[26-Mar-19 09:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And historically people without KMD have been elected

[26-Mar-19 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and what happens if the PoP miners get less in rewards than the BTC txfee? wouldnt that mean there wont be any more PoP to BTC?

[26-Mar-19 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it seems they are making some extreme fud about notaries

according to their WP, looks like they're also based on the OP_RETURN, the only difference compared to Komodo is any miner can notarize üòï

[26-Mar-19 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, even a mining pool can do this

[26-Mar-19 11:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Couldnt a pool then start notarizing falselyvif they have enough hash? Pointing a fork to be the real chain?

[26-Mar-19 11:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Gonna read their wp tomorrow, late low üò¥

[27-Mar-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seems to open up the possibility of nicehash attacks, having notarization fully decentralized might not really be such a good thing

"As explained by Bithumb, the company failed to consider the possibility of insiders including employees and contractors breaching into the system of the exchange to steal millions of funds held by the company."

So... you want some of that sweet, sweet staking yield, right? Have you looked at the other side of the equation (i.e. inflation)? Do you know the real yield?

Homo sapiens has not found, and will not find, a way to equitably distribute capital and distribute it in a manner that everyone agrees.

The easy way to solve ethical conflict in this matter is to pour water on the road. In other words, we abandon the accumulation of capital, so there is no capital that the elite can plunder. 

Perhaps the most righteous solution to this is the historical experience that has made mankind most painful. Homo sapiens' ethics of footing on this earth have a natural limit line, and for any reason they are not content to dream beyond their limits. 

If I say that I will institutionalize it, I may immediately receive the curse of Icarus as a punishment.
