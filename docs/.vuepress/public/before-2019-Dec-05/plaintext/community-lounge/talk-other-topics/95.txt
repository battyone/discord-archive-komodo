The HempCoin $THC is closer to the new Komodo THC chain.

All THC coins needs removed from ANY exchange including Coinomi to a QT wallet. Coins in a QT wallet will be in the Snapshot for the new technology chain.

Now something really interesting is going on at Bitcoin World. Perhaps the full picture of the Satoshi mystery will be fully revealed between late this month and the middle of next month.

A U.S. court has issued a final notice to Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi, to come up with a list of early mining bitcoin. Otherwise, contempt of court may be applied.

Craig claims to be Satoshi, but he doesn't have a key with a million bitcoin right now because it's in a common purse designed by Dave Kleiman, who helped with security-related work during Bitcoin operations.

Kleiman died in 2013 and his brother sued Craig to give his brother's share. Kleiman left a USB when he died, and his brother kept it. The USB may contain the secret of the security wallet, but Kleiman's past partners testify that it would be difficult to solve even if it were.

If Craig is really Satoshi, he was been made a good use by Kleiman.

Kleiman's brother, his lawyer, and Craig share the premise that Craig is Satoshi and that Kleiman assisted in his work. Craig is almost the only one who is being sued by people who are convinced of his existence.

It is not until January of next year that the wallet of the security key is handed over to him, and that is what Craig believes and may have to ask the dead Kleiman.

If Craig is a fake Satoshi, the lawsuit itself should be the play of the gang. To prove that Craig is Satoshi. If Craig is Satoshi, he can win an inexhaustible copyright suit on blockchain-related core technologies and share profits later. If so, he is in a position to go to jail by a U.S. court for pushing the play too hard.

[21-Jun-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
dust sent to hundred+ big BTC addresses, to establish links between wallet addresses if the user is careless

[21-Jun-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
that is likely sent by chainanalysis

[21-Jun-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
then if any of those addresses carelessly send and a different address is included in the vin, BAM! the two are linked

[21-Jun-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
this sort of thing can also deanonymize XMR and GRIN, though with GRIN you dont even need to use the dust as miners get all the tx in plaintext

What I'm wondering is: How is an Exchange supposed to send the data required to another wallet address? I know they only need to do that if they're dealing with another company, but still...

[21-Jun-19 06:31 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Will FATF require special company addresses, so the exchange can distinguish that?

[21-Jun-19 06:31 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I don't think so, not to mention not being able to transmit the data without putting a LOT of data on the chain.

[21-Jun-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems all addresses need to be registered by an exchange into a central database so all the other exchanges, officials, hackers, your neighbor, can tell exactly all the addresses you have

There has to be better solutions where a person and a business can comply with aml but possibly keep their data encrypted and only allow certain providers to see it within a certain time frame.

[22-Jun-19 06:10 AM] PTYX#6840
It depends. Aml doesn't assume you guilty. It's an invasion of privacy in a sense

[22-Jun-19 06:10 AM] PTYX#6840

Once you did the due diligence which is part of the aml and kyc you would be able to determine if the client has or has had any problems with the law.

[22-Jun-19 06:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Then it's up to the business to assume the risk

in theory perhaps, but in reality, storing this information makes it potentially available to anyone with the means or skills to get a copy.

I mentioned the Reserve Protocol  but now I can't find where I posted it. I shared it because maybe it could be useful to Komodo as there is some work being done on stable coins. Everybody is talking about Libra, but this new project is backed by some huge players including Peter Thiel and Coinbase Ventures and their aim is to replace FIAT with a better alternative.. They have two coins, one is the stable coin that will come out, and one is the one that fluctuates (called $RSR - Reserve rights) and helps the stablecoin keep stability. It's a shame they launched on Ethereum and not Komodo... Towards the end of the talk they do mention privacy and maybe using ZK-Snarks (but as a choice, with also transparent addresses, like ZCash). The interesting concept in this talk is that the stablecoin can be pegged to other blockchains. I think they have a great logo by the way - for what they are planning to offer.

I think no matter how great a project is (like Reserve), if it doesn't offer strong privacy it's a problem...nobody wants their finances to be public. In this talk they say they like the idea of pseudonimity (like Bitcoin) but that will be less and less private in the future with analytics becoming more and more sophisticated. But I find it much better than Libra which I don't trust at all.

It must not be easy to find a balance between privacy and security for policy makers and governments, as the two go against each other. But what's annoying is that I think they do things wrongly, usually targeting innocent people and constantly harassing them as if they have done something wrong, while the criminals go mostly untouched.
