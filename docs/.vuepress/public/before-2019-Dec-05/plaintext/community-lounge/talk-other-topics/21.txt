possible, but then in the future dev will be the one telling AI what to code. Now the path is: product owner preparing requirements -> dev implementing. I can't see how product owners will be able to explain AI what to code. DEvs will do that, only new specialization will be needed... until there will be such advanced AI that hearing what product creators wants will ask a lot of specific questions to precise and then make a code... far future ?

Hey guys can someone tell me why would I use xrp over any other "fast coin" thats decentralized blockchain. I just dont understand  how xrp fits to this space. asked this on Crypto.com discord and the aswer was because its fast. so is there a real reason why so many praises xrp?

I think ripple labs did a lot of the work on Crypto Conditions ?

[03-Oct-18 02:32 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
and why do i live in a reality where xrp is the hotstuff and no one knows about komodo? i mean independent blocchains with the security of btc and anonimity from zksnarks AND scalable since everyone has their own blockchain

i wouldnt say small part

[03-Oct-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but I added a significant layer on top, so now we have specific CC vout types

[03-Oct-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
each new CC is like a new p2pk, p2pkh, p2sh type of output

[03-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
XPR itself is terrible

[03-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it exsts only to fund Ripple Labs

[03-Oct-18 02:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the entire coin was premined

Is there anything for the consumer from Ripple labs? I understand why people would fund say Crypto.com since consumers can spend and trade easily with the app but does ripple give anything to tehe consumers?

I know that they help banks to transfer money around but is it just for banks?

[03-Oct-18 02:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dont really know that much about it, but ripple labs has done some good work in the space in general. I remeber watching a video about it but cant find the link atm.

[03-Oct-18 02:53 PM] M√∂r√∂k√∂lli (Boogeyman)#8765
it seems so because i cant get no real answers from any subreddit or discord group
