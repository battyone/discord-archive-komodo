@APompliano No one takes cash in China anymore. It's all wechat pay and they keep a credit and social score on you. You go below the score limit, they cut off your paying ability and you can't even take public transport. You can not complain about this online.

Hamilton's bank model was nearly identical to the Bank of England, except Hamilton wanted to exclude the government from being involved in public debt. Apparently, it was the best machinery at that time?

[06-Sep-19 05:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hamilton basically invented the airdrop.  Following the American Revolution,  The new United States was in debt to several foreign powers ,  uniquely each state had its own debts and its own currency.  To get the states out of debt and the nation under one currency, he proposed the first central bank of the US ,  adopting the states debts as the basis for international credit.

neutrality is all the more important because blockchain is the area of communication that even platforms need to be compatible. Google and Facebook will never participate in blockchain that was created by Kakao or Line. on the other hand, TCP/IP, the Internet protocol, is free and voluntary. this is because the protocol itself is neutral and there is no need to rely on a particular principal. In other words, in order for blockchain to become a protocol, preconditions such as fixity, firmness, market competitiveness, neutrality, and compatibility must be met.

Protocols should be fixed. While Bitcoin appears and developers who have jumped into the industry may be young Silicon Valley-type developers, it seems that they think change and improvement are ideal and good directions. Ethereum has been redirected or modified once every six months, and various blockchaines have sought to apply new technologies to suit the trend each time.

What they did not understand was that for the ecosystem to develop, protocols must be stable and unchanged. TCP/IP has rarely changed since its advent. This fixedness and stability give businesses and developers confidence to create the protocol-based service. If entrepreneurs are creating something and some developers have to arbitrarily modify protocols to make them incompatible or change the direction of the business, who will inject capital and time?

[07-Sep-19 09:14 AM] designer#4893
Thus, diversification/multi-diversification of the technological development of an industrial group is not an absolute development Building technology and services on fixed protocols is a real development. For bitcoinSV, the components of the protocol are not changed, while ensuring scalability. If a change in BTC, such as segwit, RBFs, etc., or unverified technologies such as CTOR and Pre-consensus in BCH are simply started to be preferred and good by a particular developer, the change will be sustainable and impedes the development of the ecosystem.

Bitcoin SV launched 14 protocol layers, 35 development tools, and about 161 services in the eight months since its inception. It's like 0.7 projects a day were born every day. The reason why this explosive growth can be achieved is that the protocol is guaranteed to be secure and scalable.

Unfortunately, the worst misunderstanding created by the emergence of Vitalik and Ethereum is the trilemma. Scalability, de-centrality, and security mean that three rabbits cannot be caught at once. For example, if you want to gain the scalability and security of a blockchain, you have to give up decentralization. Thanks to the trilemma, the blockchain industry is divided into blockchain that emphasizes "remoteness plus security" and blockchain that emphasizes "extended plus security."

A representative example of blockchain that emphasizes decentralization and security is bitcoin. They have practically given up on expansion and are obsessed with digital gold and safety assets, which are economically insane ideologies. On the other hand, examples of blockchain emphasizing scalability and security are EOS or Kakao's Clayton-type blockchain, where participation in the network is not competitive

author denies the trilemma itself. reason why trilemma does not exist is that of these three factors, scalability, decentrality, and security, the definition of de-centrality itself is wrong Decentralization never means the number of nodes. Just because the number of nodes in a particular blockchain is larger than the other blockchain does not mean that it is more de-centralized. The word decentralization should be replaced by the competitive openness of the network.

[07-Sep-19 09:21 AM] designer#4893
Decentralization is essentially the robustness of the network. this means that the network cannot be interrupted by a particular entity, whether it is a hacker or a state. Blockchain developers seem naive to think that as many nodes as possible should have all the data for the robustness of the network. What they didn't understand was that the robustness of the network was not affected by the number of nodes, but by the connections between the nodes.

centrality and centralization of network topology are distinctly different concepts. Bitcoin evolves over time into a network that is centrality. As few hubs as possible when the miners are connected and the transactions are spread over the entire network, so that they can be safely transferred even if they are not a confirm.

[07-Sep-19 09:26 AM] designer#4893
In order for the network to go through scalability, security, and de-centralization, the BTC's 'Raspberry Pi Node' based network is in vain because the nodes participating in the network must be connected together. When nodes distributed around the world are not directly connected to each other, and are connected only to the surrounding nodes, the network itself is only configured in mesh form, and this type of network is never safe nor expandable. After all, powerful nodes that can connect to each other have to be responsible for the security and expansion of the network.

Bitcoin's original design was for large data centers to form networks. And the reason why those data centers can be created is "economy." Blockchain's focus on security plus scalability described above is a very important missing element. All protocols, as well as blockchain, expand on the basis of economics. The reason the Internet Protocol, which was not able to send a picture, was able to communicate and stream 5G is because of the economy that provided an incentive to advance the technology.

[07-Sep-19 09:34 AM] designer#4893
Think about why big companies like AT&T and Verizon use astronomical capital to build infrastructure. This is because the Internet economy, which is worth trillions of won, is derived by having an infrastructure that transmits more data quickly as 'competitive'. We can use the faster Internet every year and pay reasonable costs in "how much for a few gigabytes." Blockchain is no different at all.

As the economy of the Bitcoin ecosystem grows, more data and more transactions need to be put in, and the miners who deal with them get a reasonable price (=Transaction Fee. Although BTC cannot achieve this economic growth because of block size being 1MB, it has already extended the default value of block size to 2GB for Bitcoin SV, which follows the intent of this Satoshi Nakamoto.

In order for this economic expansion to take place, participation in the network must be free up. In other words, if you have capital and technical skills, you should be able to act as a node in a network without someone's permission. The reason why blockchain in the form of EOS and Clayton is unsustainable is that competing participation of the network is impossible. No matter how many hundreds of nodes are created, participation criteria can never be seen as a neutral, sustainable decentral network if the criteria are developers' choices, partnerships or high capital.

Blockchain can be maintained only by a thoroughly capitalist system. This market competition and the economics of that competition maintain the protocol. Just as there are countless carriers around the world, and just because their sizes are large, no one is calling the Internet a centralized protocol, so is blockchain. I dare say. Clayton, Link and many other blockchaines end up ruined.

bitcoin = bit(information)+coin(money)

Bitcoin is a combination of bit and coin. bit means information, coin means money. The meeting of data and values means that the data itself is a player of financial value as described above. We only own it as a key. In other words, combining the possibility of putting data into a blockchain with the ability to place monetary value on that data could change the paradigm of the Internet itself.

It is a service where people who want to write, encrypt, and put it on a blockchain, and show the entire text when they make small payments with bitcoin. The writer broadcasts encrypted messages through the Bitcoin network, and the user sends money to the data, but is directly passed on to the person who owns the data with the key. This seemingly simple service implies quite profound content.

A small amount of monetary value can be attached to the data, which means that the Internet's chronic problem, the advertising-based economy, can be brought back to a consumption-based economy. Until now, most IT companies have transformed the industry by providing free services and selling traffic and users' personal information to advertisers. This is because most of the information that communicates on the Internet and actions on the Internet cannot be financially valued.

The consumer economy, which buys and sells $100 pants, works perfectly without problems through the Internet, but even though very low-priced actors such as Facebook's good, Twitter Post and KakaoTalk messages are valuable, they have to be provided free of charge because there is no financial platform to value them. I use these services for free now, but in fact, my data is being sold out, making me a commodity for myself.

The change in the media industry is more pronounced. Before the development of the Internet, people paid subscription fees and bought high-quality newspapers. It was strictly an economic activity through a direct exchange of values between service providers and consumers. After the advent of the Internet industry, the media had to survive on advertising sales with traffic ahead of news quality, and as a result, low-quality news and fake news became the dominant world.

People are tired of advertising-based Internet. Until now, there has been no choice but to spend a small amount of money without my personal information being used or seeing advertisements. Pay-as-you-go-based services are now available in areas such as video, blogs, social network
