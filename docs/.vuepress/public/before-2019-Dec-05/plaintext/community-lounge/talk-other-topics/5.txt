wow that's interesting

[08-Jun-18 09:22 AM] jl777#0000
correct, if 1BTC is a big trade in DEX land, then all the same effort needs to be done to gain 1BTC as tens of millions of dollars

[08-Jun-18 09:22 AM] 1stormingj#0000
DEXs require more work to be done to execute, but can be done with almost complete anonymity

[08-Jun-18 09:22 AM] 1stormingj#0000
It's only a solace while DEXs are illiquid

[08-Jun-18 09:22 AM] jl777#0000
yes, no need to photoshop any id documents

I have no idea how it's calcualted and if correct/ relevant but most coins on the list attack is quite cheap

[08-Jun-18 09:24 AM] jl777#0000
!!! now we know your chicken

[08-Jun-18 09:25 AM] smk762#0000
$7 to attack moon coin? I suspect it is really a death star.

[08-Jun-18 09:26 AM] smk762#0000
I've been blocked from a couple of cex for trolling signups.

[08-Jun-18 09:31 AM] smk762#0000
kmd should apply for listing on https://www.crypto51.app/

[08-Jun-18 09:31 AM] jl777#0000
it was there, but when we explained about notary mining, they couldnt calculate the costs for attack, so they removed KMD

[08-Jun-18 09:32 AM] smk762#0000
got to be at least same as BTC no?

[08-Jun-18 09:32 AM] jl777#0000
actually a bit more to undo past notarization

[08-Jun-18 09:33 AM] jl777#0000
but much less to rewrite the non-notarized part of the chain

[08-Jun-18 09:33 AM] smk762#0000
or they consdering potential for malicious notaries?

[08-Jun-18 09:35 AM] smk762#0000
so thanks to bitcoin, we're more secure than bitcoin, but with a temporary attack surface the size of an intergalactic rodent?

[08-Jun-18 09:35 AM] jl777#0000
with KMD both 51% hashrate and notaries corruption is needed

[08-Jun-18 09:36 AM] jl777#0000
at current marketprices the mining reward is not enough to get a very high hashrate

[08-Jun-18 09:36 AM] jl777#0000
over time, this will change but for now the non-notarized chain should be considered unconfirmed for large transactions

[08-Jun-18 04:15 PM] newkemet#0000
shoot 3 times in the head i guess ?

[08-Jun-18 06:23 PM] jjk14150#0000
if all of the big payment companies make their own blockchain, would that make the current cryptocurrencies obsolete?

[08-Jun-18 06:23 PM] jjk14150#0000
or if Amazon, walmart... make their own bc

[08-Jun-18 06:25 PM] jjk14150#0000
i guess they'd be similar to ripple? Controlling their own supply

[08-Jun-18 06:34 PM] cryptoon#0000
Would they even need a currency?

[08-Jun-18 06:35 PM] cryptoon#0000
Or just a public ledger?

[08-Jun-18 06:36 PM] cryptoon#0000
I assume it would be somehow centralized, so no need for pow/pos to secure it, so no need for a currency to incentivize the people securing it?

Anybody know about the fork at Tezos?
To claim the new "Tezos Libres" they ask for a cryptographic signature and to obtain it they have to give the secret key or private key.

‚ÄúSix mistakes mankind keeps making century after century:
Believing that personal gain is made by crushing others;
Worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected;
Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it;
Refusing to set aside trivial preferences;
Neglecting development and refinement of the mind;
Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.‚Äù-Marcus Tullius Cicero
