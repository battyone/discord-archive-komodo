closed source, maybe it has some backdoor that allows the binance to make any tx they want to, like ripple being able to edit XRP being a feature they are proud of

@bergealex4 I think long long term (30-50 years) you'll be able to do everything on top of Bitcoin and there will be no use for any other cryptocurrency. But for the next Bitcoin bull run, a Lightning Network on top of Litecoin could provide a use case.

@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ they want you to think it is just standard ToS. but it also allows them to have account freezing, funds confiscation, etc. in their closed source, doesnt it? and nobody could complain as it is in the ToS

first of all, I'm surprised that Zuckerberg's courage and frankness. a developer-turned-manager can carry on a long-term conversation with a world-class master's degree without a manuscript... nevertheless, the limitations of a lack of a dimensional understanding and insight into the world and history are clearly revealed.

@Deleted User just that Harari's logic is more refined.

for example, 55-minute question of democracy and totalitarianism, 
soviet Union's defeat in the cold war, was due to the technical limitations of the central planning system, and now that data technology has developed dramatically, is not totalitarianism a threat? to this mid-level question, zuckerberg seems to be just expressing his optimism for democracy.

[27-Apr-19 11:01 PM] bogybogy#3962
bout ERC20 -- barring something rather surprising coming up, our beta will be on the good old ERC20 AGI token, but indeed we are building our network so that it would be possible to switch blockchains without messing with the AI Agent code.   We have also mapped out a scheme that could allow multiple blockchains to co-exist within the SingularityNET Agent world, but it's not at all sure that we will end up going this direction...I think after the Platform release they will do everything to be well known everywhere. Until then 200-300m and later on I hope way more 

Ben Goertzel 
"Response to some previous message: Of course, if a shift were made in future away from ERC20 or to a framework enabling a mix of blockchains, it would be done in a way that would preserve the proportional value of the current ERC20 AGI tokens... anything else would be wrong and ridiculous...About Hashgraph, i think this and other graph-based mechanisms are quite interesting, but Hashgraph right now is not free and open source sofware, which is not optimal from my view...I expect a bunch of other graph based approaches will emerge in the next years.And then of course there's our Anton Kolonin's Proof of Reputation scheme, which could be implemented as our own -chain- (more likely graph) or in partnership with another project. For smart contracts, I like the approach of our partner project Kirik.io ... formally verifiable/analyzable smart contracts ... fits naturally with AI ...The reason to have a cleanly layered software design is to be open to the best possibilities that emerge as things advance (as advance in this space is so rapid and unpredictable) ... but for the beta we are sticking with the blockchain-layer software that is most robust , best adopted and easiest to work with at the present moment.."Ben Goertzel

government cannot stop the blockchain-or exactly bitcoin revolution. It is a great achievement of Satoshi Nakamoto who devoted their lives to separating monetary power from corrupt political forces that control money. bitcoin is the last hope of the a powerless commoner in a disgusting world where hard work is deprived of all the fruits of sweat by bad governments.

An ideal smart contract that is implemented without the help of an authoritative arbitrator, and furthermore without human intervention, is not feasible. If possible, it is a very special case and it is time to give up ideals little by little. So the courts and lawyers can rest assured. 

Even so, however, the passion for smart contract generated by blockchain is not meaningless. Although Ethereum does not make smart contract possible, there is a growing possibility that global companies, spurred by Ethereum, will build an ecosystem that partially complements. The fact that legislation to recognize blockchain-based smart contract as part of a contract is underway in many U.S. states is also an incomprehensible contradiction from the ideals of smart contract. However, it is highly likely that in the near future, mankind is not even aware that it is a smart contract while utilizing an industrialized smart contract.

he thinks its game over for bitfinex

@klein quadriga, exmo, coinapult,and CEX.io were involved at one point or another

[28-Apr-19 01:45 PM] PTYX#6840
BFX distanced themselves from crypto capital a few years ago. However, when they first launched they used cryptocapitals withdrawal and deposit methods

Yeah but this is the first time I have heard about the white label exchange service and liquidity providers from crypto capital

[28-Apr-19 02:09 PM] klein#5233
I also think they (bfx) are delusional if they think they can just ignore these requests from the US government

[28-Apr-19 03:15 PM] PTYX#6840
It doesn't seem they were running a whitelabel exchange service. They ran a liquidity service.

[28-Apr-19 03:15 PM] PTYX#6840
Albeit, exmo, CEX.io, and quadriga are very similar.

If you think-

-harassing former coworkers *years* after being fired is fine

-using company time to work on a competing product is fine

-stealing merch is fine

-medical conditions are hilarious

then congrats! You are a Samourai Wallet co-founder.
