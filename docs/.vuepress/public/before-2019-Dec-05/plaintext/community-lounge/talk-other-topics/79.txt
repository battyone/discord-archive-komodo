this is what you get when a society accepts the "everyone gets a trophy" mantra.. you end up with a bunch of disconnected, living-in-a-bubble "leaders"

[10-May-19 07:54 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw:
in '87-88 insurance was disconnected from "healthcare" (not a synonym for it), considered a "fringe benefit", and a reason to select one job over another

[10-May-19 07:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
before the voting season in an election, candidates should take a raven test (language agnostic) and go through some herculean tasks to prove their salt

[10-May-19 07:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
otherwise you get poor design with faulty logic and flawed execution passed as "laws"

[10-May-19 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What I mean is that "everyone should have healthcare" isn't the same message now as then
then healthcare meant feken healthcare
now healthcare means insurance because actual healthcare reforms will never happen --- too much $ involved

The same thing would happen to anyone sitting down with a task in front of an unfamiliar interface. 

It’s like sitting your grandma down in front of a terminal window and asking her to give you a list of files without ever telling her about “ls.”

[12-May-19 08:07 AM] nocturnal#2177
if everyone is there own bank

[12-May-19 08:08 AM] nocturnal#2177
everyones life savings can be robbed just by breaking into their house and forcing them to send you their btc

[12-May-19 08:08 AM] nocturnal#2177
I cant see any way round that physical security issue....

[12-May-19 08:15 AM] nocturnal#2177
what do you mean? @designer

[12-May-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont let people know how much you have, how would they know how much you had?

[12-May-19 08:21 AM] nocturnal#2177
they wouldn't, the same a way a burgler doesnt know what is in your house, but they assume there will be something

[12-May-19 08:21 AM] nocturnal#2177
and if everyone's saving are in crypto (in the future) then you can be fairly sure there will be something

[12-May-19 08:22 AM] nocturnal#2177
especially in a big house

[12-May-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so have some decoy accounts

not all in a single address

[12-May-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or say it is in PIRATE, then it is really hard to know the total as an outsider

hmm if a group of guys have you and your family tied up in your house i think most ppl will hand over what they have

i think its a real problem tbh

[12-May-19 08:24 AM] nocturnal#2177
but sure there is a solution... there usually is

[12-May-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] nocturnal#2177
there you go 😃

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] nocturnal#2177
sounds complicated for average joe

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
you can truthfully say you dont have it

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] nocturnal#2177
but if its your life savings would be worth setting it up

[12-May-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
or just multisig

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] nocturnal#2177
yes good thinking

[12-May-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
or timelocked multisig in a timelocked ladder

[12-May-19 08:28 AM] nocturnal#2177
i think these things will become very important

@nocturnal that's why elite rules society. people are not rational. the world need order.
