Deanon 96% of $GRIN + $BEAM transactions, oh my!

Mimblewimble is no panacea.

This technique has been theoretically known for over 1 year:

yes I remember too- just seems as if it has been ignored so far (try that first), and just been 're'-discovered .. maybe the topic gets some traction this time around

[18-Nov-19 05:07 PM] phm87#7395
I am in a Grin channel, everybody knew about this pb. They say that the guy who published the tweet was looking for traction/marketing
In addition, during the grin testnet, they relaunched chain from 0 several times. I think that it is possible that Grin is not the final coin, they can launch anogher one. So this kind of pb is tiny. Other privacy features should be released next year

so when BTC goes belly up (as also Rick Falkvinge explains very succinctly), Komodo can then notarize to whatever Big Kahnua emerges after that?

the more complex the ecosystem, the more the central role emerges. bitcoin maximalists believe bitcoin will become the center of the giant blockchain ecosystem. the overwhelming proportion of bitcoin in terms of total value and the fact that powerful governments have failed to say they would ban bitcoin is a "phenomenon" that strongly supports the prediction that bitcoin's ruggedness will be the bed for sophisticated technologies.

[19-Nov-19 05:07 AM] designer#4893
If you admit that bitcoin is more like currency or currency, this logic of putting the status quo at the forefront will be stronger than you might think. The key to money is trust, which is empirical. The undeniable phenomenon of Bitcoin maintaining its oldest, most expensive and most robust system cannot separate the public's trust in bitcoin, which is a competitive advantage that can hardly be overturned until a strong shock comes.

another technically overwhelming blockchain system is unlikely to have a strong impact on bitcoin. 

this is because the technology used for bitcoin is crude. you may think it's rational to push out a crude technology by more sophisticated technology, but because it's crude, it's possible to boast sophisticated techniques. 

bitcoin is not optimized for any particular use. It's the result of choices that give up much of it to reinforce its predictive nature. the fact that coin's creator does not appear in the media also helps to increase predictability, but above all, the neutrality that bitcoin is not influenced by big companies or strong nations is the identity of bitcoin.

acknowledging the fact that bitcoin is or is close to money, this logic that puts the phenomenon ahead is more powerful than you think. the core of money is trust, which is empirical. the undeniable phenomenon that bitcoin is the oldest, the most expensive and the most robust system, and the public's trust in bitcoin is inseparable, and this is a competitive advantage that cannot be reversed until a strong shock comes.

Saying "there is no proof" is something entirely different

[21-Nov-19 07:03 PM] allbits#5898
Or you might say something like "the only proof so far is ... and that should be disregarded because of ...".   Then you would be advancing the discussion instead of obfuscating it

[21-Nov-19 07:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Proof would be showing the transactions that were a sale to this OTC broker as well as some sort of statement that he was not supposed to sell.    I’m not saying anything should be disregarded but all that is presented right now is some guy in telegram making an accusation

[21-Nov-19 07:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m not in dune nor tezos btw

[21-Nov-19 07:07 PM] allbits#5898
There is also the Dune Network statement which is circumstantial evidence that something serious is afoot. Organizations don't cause people to be suspended for mere "some guy in telegram"' stuff.  The Dune statement is additional "proof", if you actually understand the word

[21-Nov-19 07:07 PM] allbits#5898
proof

/pro͞of/

noun

1.

evidence or argument establishing or helping to establish a fact or the truth of a statement.

[21-Nov-19 07:09 PM] allbits#5898
All through the K64 saga, people kept saying "there is no proof". There was lots.

[21-Nov-19 07:10 PM] allbits#5898
In this case, I have no idea where the truth lies, nor do I even care. Just cleaning up your false statement that there is no proof

[21-Nov-19 07:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What is the evidence establishing the truth of the claim that Fabien was dumping millions of Dune

[21-Nov-19 07:12 PM] allbits#5898
Anyone can answer that. You can answer it yourself. What you mean to say is that you discount that evidence, or find it completely unsubstantiated or even false, for whatever reason. Not that it doesn't even exist.

[21-Nov-19 07:13 PM] allbits#5898
I'm not sure why you're having trouble understanding such a simple concept.

The guy said that we should look at balance of dn1RwYfk5Mgd43xzbcD5pvDmHUsYuX4Bmbjc, 400k should come from the 600k coming from  KT1NwrTJhKZ6GB8Sq4Dx3cbaM1WPJJRniYGz

@phm87  thank you,  that is some evidence

[21-Nov-19 07:16 PM] phm87#7395
You re welcome but this info iscoming from a guy who don t like one guy at Dune and kmd

[21-Nov-19 07:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Better than the telegram message which provides nothing

[21-Nov-19 07:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don’t have a horse in this race,  I’m not discounting any evidence just trying to find out what the evidence of the claim is.

[22-Nov-19 12:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
🤷‍♂️ he didn’t dump 8m

[22-Nov-19 12:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
2m remains in account so that’s 25% accounted for. 12m founders coin have not moved as promised

[22-Nov-19 12:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
300k was loaned to me to help my baker not over delegate I have written contract in regards to this

[22-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
xxx,xxx was airdropped to some Ocu community members and Zexo etc

[22-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
At least 50% is already accounted for

[22-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It’s all tezos fudders joining and trying to wreak the project. Fabien has not even had a chance to reply to any of it before everyone took the word as truth

[22-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If you actually check the linked tx between the accounts there around 500k

[22-Nov-19 12:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
That’s 10k or so. Hardly anything to blow this big out of proportion
