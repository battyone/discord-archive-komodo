It is unlikely to be given so much time to accept that ownership carved in Bitcoin is more certain than that of global companies or the U.S. government.

Bitcoin becomes the safest register office of Human Inventions.

[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] designer#4893
In fact, the argument between the on-and-off-chain camp is so hot because it touches on the essential question of "what is Bitcoin?" If mainstream media, the public and on-chain advocates focus on the value of implementing low-cost payments, which was also the original purpose of bitcoin, those who prefer off-chain methods consider Bitcoin to be the "safe registry" invented by mankind.

Distribution is merely a technical solution for better resilience and robustness. 

Neutrality of the ledger network is the break-through. 

A tech that focuses on distributing nodes for the sake of decentralization without achieving neutrality is useless.

china seems to have finished cleaning up traffic in relation to blockchain. It's scary but I'm looking forward to it.

We are now at the beginning of the Bitcoin imperialist era.

BTC empire ?

Our aircraft carriers will be powered by BTC

[28-Oct-19 02:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
maybe nuclear carriers already mine BTC

[28-Oct-19 02:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That would actually not be too stupid... aircraft carriers are able to generate more than they consume most of the time, would make sense to use some of it to mine

[28-Oct-19 02:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
and if done in international waters maybe even taxfree

Cryptography is a tool; it can be used to hide secrets via encryption but it can also be used to track data via public keys & digital signatures. It should come as no shock that government adoption of blockchain technology will be to take advantage of the latter.
