Artificial intelligence and  5G what could go wrong

[24-Jan-19 09:49 PM] PTYX#6840
5G is dangerous to humans is what I read. Most people don't know that to give cancer to rats, they expose them to a certain wave frequency for an amount of time. I saw a hearing of someone talking for the full research of 4g and 5g effects on the body.

[24-Jan-19 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
everything, including pure H₂O, "causes cancer in lab rats" 😕

They say 5G heats your blood and diabetes and other heart diseases could be targeted into someone

`Could you boil water with 5G?` depends on the MPa, I reckon

there was also temperature measurment (a bit of water)

[24-Jan-19 10:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
no significant temperature gain

[24-Jan-19 10:03 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
meaning - tempretature could go up 0.1 but it could be also due to many people around

[24-Jan-19 10:04 PM] Hermes#6934
Well if Soros and Trump agree on something I am pretty sure they don't want China taking over their infraestructure

[25-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Roger Stone, a key ally of Donald Trump, has been arrested on charges of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements, the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has announced.

[25-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Hermes#6934
No ties to Russia just perjury trap

[25-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Hermes#6934
when the FBI doesn't have any real evidence they just make a perjury trap...

[25-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Hermes#6934
If you don't remember something exactly as it happened ...something from 5 years ago you can commit perjury

[25-Jan-19 02:22 PM] Hermes#6934

yeah the thing is that this guy was giving constant interviews and so they can use his interviews as perjury evidence

[25-Jan-19 06:01 PM] Hermes#6934
yeah I was thinking the same until I saw a very crazy video...so crazy that I felt as if a demon came out of the screen of my laptop

[25-Jan-19 06:07 PM] Hermes#6934
I think they are in the point of no return...by the end of the day...Maduro is just  kicking the can for a few more months the most...the next excuse will be that there are people extracting oil and gold from the border in Brazil and Colombia and a small invasion of that territory will take place
