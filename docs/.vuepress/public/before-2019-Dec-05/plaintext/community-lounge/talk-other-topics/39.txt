It is interesting to watch the Komodo team.
If you try to match trends, markets and regulations, innovation will never come. 
keep going your own way. 
I believe that if you feel a thrill in every part of Komodo, it will spread like an epidemic. 
I want to be more crazy about Komodo.

such brilliant minds at work

[19-Dec-18 08:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but LN makes sense if you can open/close a channel easily, even if infrequently, the idea the end users will only ever transact on LN with hardly a single 'settlement' tx in their life (I've read this idea) has still a lot of unresolved practical issues

[19-Dec-18 08:13 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but if you question all this, they get mad at you

[19-Dec-18 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
in our CHIPS work we are trying to use the LN in a hubless environment and it is not been easy to get it to work as there are a lot of important functionality not there yet. so channel creation is needed more often than otherwise

[19-Dec-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and that takes a confirmed BTC txfee, which in the fee market scenario is 10x to 100x more expensive...

[19-Dec-18 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
they painted themselves into a corner with the LN requiring a totally new infrastructure from daemons, wallets, explorers, etc.

Even if you flip that, the motivation becomes Hillary-esque in that it's far more of an enterprise solution for Bitcoin rather than something "most users" would ever have a realistic use for (absent wide-spread adoption of BTC as an actual currency)
