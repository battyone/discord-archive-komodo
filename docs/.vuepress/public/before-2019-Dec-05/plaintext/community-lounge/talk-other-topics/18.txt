this is good for the government if large financial companies play an important role in the crypto-currency ecosystem. this is because the government can manage the crypto-currency ecosystem by controlling financial companies. the reason why SEC does not approve Bitcoin ETF is because it lacks confidence that the government can manage it.

[09-Sep-18 12:33 PM] designer#4893
The approval of the ETF is more likely to be given as a result of mainstreaming than to mainstreaming cause, but it is not a good result for those who advocate the philosophical value of bitcoin.

@medium sized komodo, I remember my first week in my first job like yesterday, it was awful, I knew I couldn't do that for +40 years, and it terrified me and made me depressed. The good news is it forced me to 'construct' a much better way to make a living rather than accept working in horrible toxic environments. I now have the perfect job for me, it took a while to 'Make' it, but it was worth the effort. Most people stay in less than ideal circumstances because they can tolerate dissatisfaction much better than me, but the long term effects can be negative on your well being, you can easily become cynical, bitter, jealous, mean spirited. Consider your current feelings as a source of motivation power that can get you from A to B, good luck!

[17-Sep-18 12:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I typically never stayed at a job I no longer liked except for my last job because o had children and bought a house and being in a small town, good paying jobs are not the easiest to come by, however since I been working here, mostly as a volunteer,  not part of the team, its something I really enjoy and I can work when ever I want, although latley that has been more hours than any "real" job I have ever worked, guess that's what happens when you enjoy something.
