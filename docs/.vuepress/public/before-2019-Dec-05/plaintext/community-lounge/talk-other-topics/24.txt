Woah, where did that come from. Sorry to hear man .___. sounds rough, I don't have anything to compare or relate to that. I appreciate you being open about it though. Didn't expect it to go that way.

i think he also has some OCD, so it would be good for people to give him some slack

[09-Oct-18 01:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
shouldn't have moved away from slack then ;D

To a certain extent, I had to switch from slack to discord because of channeling. 😛

[09-Oct-18 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
As far as OCD, I often kid about that but the doctors that I've seen in the past tend to be wishy-washy on if they agree or not (pretty much a 50/50 split)

[09-Oct-18 01:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
So, may I assume you chose not to care, because it's an uphill battle for you personally? Seems like a spiral looking from outside in, again don't know what it's like. But it looks to me, if you are already depressed, you aggravate people, they treat you badly because of it. Which potentially adds to your depression.

[09-Oct-18 01:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Be that on purpose, by choice or unconcsiously.

[09-Oct-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not about a "battle", it's more about the fact that I find less gain in "sugar coating" things, they are what they are. I'm the "no, your fat ass makes your ass look fat in those jeans" kind of guy.

[09-Oct-18 01:40 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Would you be surprised if I tell you, neither am I?

[09-Oct-18 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And outside of 5 people, how people treat me or "feel about" me doesn't ever have an impact on my depression (it doesn't work that way).

[09-Oct-18 01:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
How do you know for certain that it doesn't affect you?

[09-Oct-18 01:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 this kinda explains me too.... 🤔

For someone like me, the world could be unicorns shitting rainbows and when the chemical imbalance hits it hits.

[09-Oct-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Conversely, everything could be total shit and the manic kicks it.
State of life and surroundings has nothing to do with it.

[09-Oct-18 01:45 PM] Meyse#0952
We all like to be as effective and efficient as possible, sugar coating things is not that

[09-Oct-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I have to, my wife is one of those people. 20 years and I think I've seen her be blunt twice.

[09-Oct-18 01:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
By the way, I wish people would not butt into the conversation here. Nobody cares about your opinions here. This is between us. Just because we started this in a public channel doesn't mean we (or at lerast I) want your attention.

[09-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Meyse#0952
I cant live with people like that. They annoy the shit out of me

[09-Oct-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Nobody cares about your opinions here.`
You do realize that you having that same shitty attitude is what spun this in the 1st place, right?

[09-Oct-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
-----------------------------
Normally, people as nice as my wife aggravate me just because they are breathing, but she's just too wonderful to not want to be around. (plus she puts up with me)

Back on track. Genie. How come you recognize it as shitty?

[09-Oct-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Again, my recognizing what is "right" and "wrong" according to social norms and basic reason and logic have nothing to do with my willingness (or lack thereof) to follow social norms.

[09-Oct-18 02:01 PM] Meyse#0952
Social norms are strange constructs of humans anyway, they are unlogical. I dont deal with unlogical things. I might be wrong on this one tho

[09-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Meyse#0952
I like this conversation, i will keep intruding

[09-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` they are unlogical`
Actually they aren't, most are formed on the foundational belief of "if I'm nice to you, then you have to be nice to me" and everyone feels nice.

[09-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Meyse#0952
Yes i had that thought too, but deep down, i feel everyone should do what they want without Social norms and feel nice too. Would be possible i think if people focused more on themselves

[09-Oct-18 02:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I would like to contest that, there are definitely those egoistic feelings in some. There are genuinrly people who believe: if am nice to other good things will happen, but i don't expect or request it.

[09-Oct-18 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`everyone should do what they want without Social norms and feel nice too`
That can't happen, because then I can't force you to treat me the way I want to be treated. It's not actually about how you treat others, that's just the wrapping paper, it's about how people treat you.

[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Meh, it doesn't work both ways though. While some people can stay above it and see the big picture the ones who only feel can't switch away and stay logical.

[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Especially people like us in chats like these, we are not the norm.

[09-Oct-18 02:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Lots if people are the feeling type and that's the only way you can convey information to them.

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I don't see a lot of people like genie, me or you meyse.

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Meyse#0952
I think it could happen, eventually, when people will accept that the only ones that are responsible for their shit are themselves

[09-Oct-18 02:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Don't have numbers but meybe like tops 5% of population.

[09-Oct-18 02:09 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
If you go by mayer briggs, the logical types percentages are abysmally low

[09-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Meyse#0952
Yeah but jeez, if im not an optimist in some things life would be utter shit lol

[09-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Meyse#0952
So if all the worlds biggest percentage are feely people, Komodo has a long way to go

[09-Oct-18 02:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Well, good talk, thanks for sharing. It was interesting. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 , we are not too different. If you ever change your mind, let me know. I am happy to give you a few pointers on how to maximize communication results for F type personalities. I speak from experience, it took me years to learn this shit and I had the opportunity to field test in a customer support environment, where you have the biggest exposure and endless test subjects, it still feels like being a chameleon, but it has its use. I am not a natural at all in this, I can assure you that the brain is a wonderful thing and it can adapt. I don't think it's valid to use your situation as an excuse as jl777 suggested. I understand you better now, thanks for sharing. I will keep it in mind, but I won't hold you to lower standards or cut you more slack because of this. I hope you understand and don't mind.
