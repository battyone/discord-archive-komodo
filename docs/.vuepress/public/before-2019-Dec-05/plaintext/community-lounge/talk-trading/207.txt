`underserved` is a subjective term, not a legal argument

[14-Oct-18 01:42 AM] Geocold51#6462

you are showing with every single one of your replies that you are completely UNAWARE of the possible implications of what you attempted before

[14-Oct-18 01:47 AM] PTYX#6840
and they can construe it as losses

I honestly thought it was going to be anon. Was surprised when he was on screen and making sure the camera was angled right, so we could appreciate his full beauty 😄

No, 'bitch' is a noun, not a pronoun. 😝

[14-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
don't post your communications to your lawyer

[14-Oct-18 01:50 AM] Instel7#1416
You can keep doing it and even stream it, but watch out leaking your identity, that can go very wrong

[14-Oct-18 01:51 AM] PTYX#6840
@Geocold51 my suggestion to you. stop posting and talk to the lawyer. i would even reach out to einstenium and BTCP to make sure they understand you didn't have any bad intention

And if you want to practice 51% you could spawn up some assetchains

[14-Oct-18 01:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And if you get ambitious try hybrid assetchains

[14-Oct-18 01:59 AM] PTYX#6840
Komodo is too centralized for such things poly.

Beat him to death in the initiation

140 KMD well spent I suppose

[14-Oct-18 02:03 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
He didn’t want ARRR

[14-Oct-18 02:04 AM] Japesmith#0609
Cos he had nowhere to dump it

[14-Oct-18 02:04 AM] 0x03#8822
@polycryptoblog tho you gotta admit not everybody shows up 'by way of 51% attack'

[14-Oct-18 02:04 AM] 0x03#8822
that may provoke more...brutal responses

[14-Oct-18 02:05 AM] 0x03#8822
and considering that, a black eye was all we did to him i think

[14-Oct-18 02:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes still he's a kid though, brash ,  I hope he just is more careful next time,  he could end up dealing with some sue happy assholes if he targets the wrong chain

Now I'm gonna give a proper use to this channel 👀  Can anyone recommend me a platform for changing about 60 Kmd for BTC, someone has recommended me Shapeshift and Changelly

Changelly

[14-Oct-18 02:13 AM] 0x03#8822
