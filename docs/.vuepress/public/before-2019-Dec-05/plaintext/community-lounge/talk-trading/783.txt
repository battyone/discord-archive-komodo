I’ve got 13 SUPERNET and 30 DEX. Want to trade for 500 KMD

[20-Jun-19 12:11 AM] jspook16#3059
@bishop how much "bulk"

[20-Jun-19 12:13 AM] bishop#9773
up to 275k

[20-Jun-19 12:54 AM] p.#1126
Kmd being a nice dragon and going poop for Zoo keepers

[20-Jun-19 03:32 AM] jspook16#3059
@bishop what kind of exchange price are you looking for?

[20-Jun-19 03:33 AM] bishop#9773

blz sir not that low

[20-Jun-19 04:43 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Just in case I'll set buy order  at 10k

[20-Jun-19 05:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
i have set mine at 1 sat just in case

[20-Jun-19 06:13 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm not convinced that objections raised vs Libra by some States is just posturing like jl said, it's true that they would love more surveillance but there's another side to this coin: a successful Libra with its basket of fiat currencies would be a competitor to monetary policies, imagine Zuck deciding which fiat are worthy to be included and how much and Libra holding enormous reserves of them. Badly managed fiat would suffer the most. It's like a private G20. The scare is real. Now India also added to the countries announcing bans

[20-Jun-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
libra, the underground "crypto"!

[20-Jun-19 06:17 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's not a crypto, it's a third side

[20-Jun-19 06:18 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
we have fiat/central banks - decentralized crypto - and now Zuck trying his own thing

[20-Jun-19 06:18 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
except that unlike crypto, they can kill it in the cub

[20-Jun-19 06:19 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
certainly not something I want to use anyway, but the triello is fantastic

[20-Jun-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how they can kill it. FB can afford to pay for whatever licenses, bribes, etc

[20-Jun-19 06:20 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
blackmail could work better, given all informations it has access to

[20-Jun-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810

[20-Jun-19 06:48 AM] Keppie#5156
Second biggest loser on binance 😢

[20-Jun-19 06:49 AM] Keppie#5156
Please print a higher low 😄

[20-Jun-19 06:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Libra launching feels like  Déjà vu for some reason

[20-Jun-19 07:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok 10 sats, but this is pushing it

[20-Jun-19 07:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
i dont think kmd would get that low

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
ICO prices again!

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If it does risk reward would be too great to miss out on

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well ICO was 12.8k or something

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
almost there

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Too bad we have no where to long KMD 😦

[20-Jun-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
of course in fiat, still 10x ICO

[20-Jun-19 07:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's get to 128k sats so we can be 100x fiat 😛

[20-Jun-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810

James do you know if Binance DEX supports atomic swaps at all?

[20-Jun-19 07:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sorry i mean the binance chain, they just did a proxy BTC asset BTCB or something

Try buyng at 80k 😃

[20-Jun-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i would assume BNB could support atomic swaps

[20-Jun-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Might be worth the time to do a atomic swap between BTCB and KMD for some CZ brownie points

[20-Jun-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i think they use atom chain, not directly supported yet

[20-Jun-19 07:26 AM] Malti#3948

Morning all! ☕

[20-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@hyperDEX I will make sure kmd is one of the coins which Zaddex aims to allow margin trade on

[20-Jun-19 07:44 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Long kmd :Komodo: long live the dragon 🐉

[20-Jun-19 07:50 AM] betterzen#2372
Hello ! Do you know something about when Changelly start again exchange KMD ?

[20-Jun-19 07:53 AM] Flexatron#8809
15k sats like gravity at kmd

[20-Jun-19 07:54 AM] Flexatron#8809
It always drops back to it after 20k+

[20-Jun-19 07:59 AM] LocoMB#8593
has been so for a long time now- a bit annoying, to be sure.. buuut I would add to what you said: _until it doesn't!!!_ 😀

[20-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Flexatron#8809
Yeaa

[20-Jun-19 08:18 AM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
KMD volumes are always so low.

[20-Jun-19 08:19 AM] 𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™*#4914
When large volume hits , wink wink

[20-Jun-19 08:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then the new buyers are initiated

[20-Jun-19 08:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

hacker dumping loot?

[20-Jun-19 08:24 AM] Sherdogz#6731
I thought the hacker loot was bought back?

[20-Jun-19 08:43 AM] crumb#2550
James said that if a reasonable offer would be made, he would consider it

[20-Jun-19 08:43 AM] crumb#2550
he didn't say it already happened

[20-Jun-19 08:44 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Ooh so

[20-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For now James and some other donors funded out of own pocket

[20-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jansako#3330
I wonder how much of the downward pressure comes from KMD holders diversifying into Pirate & other ecosystem coins? Possibly the Hacker as well, of course.

[20-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Why would you diversify in other ecosystem coins at this stage? I would think you should have done that much earlier.

[20-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Downward pressure would only occur if the ecosystem coin sellers, sell the kmd they get afterwards

[20-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wich isnt a 1:1 relation I think

[20-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And ecosystem volume apart from pirate maybe is very low compared to total kmd volume

[20-Jun-19 09:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
diversifying in ecosystem projects in KMD is not really exactly as diversifying in the tokens based cryptocurrencies we have seen in other blockchain projects.

[20-Jun-19 09:04 AM] jansako#3330
Not a 1:1 but it was not there before

[20-Jun-19 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in KMD ecosystem, these coins are using their own native cryptocurrency value to transact and are in no way dependent on KMD fort trading and transactions etc

[20-Jun-19 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is very different than other blockchain based tokens or cryptocurrencies.

[20-Jun-19 09:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It looks to me like someone is driving the price down, maybe to accumulate im not too sure but there is no way there is this much sell pressure over this long period of time where people are selling for a profit

[20-Jun-19 09:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when I started in cryptocurrency space, I targeted to accumulate 200,000 NXT at that time.

[20-Jun-19 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was also diversifying that value to NXT based projects

[20-Jun-19 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then gradually seen the value of NXT in those were down as compare to what I had put in

[20-Jun-19 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz locked to NXT currency to transact and trading

[20-Jun-19 09:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD ecosystem project from it's incept are totally free from this kind of lock in

[20-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Keppie#5156
:pirate:

[20-Jun-19 09:22 AM] jansako#3330
It is always easier to believe in a mysterious malicious force suppressing the price (ever popular in crypto), and just because someone is paranoid, it does not mean 'they' are not out there... But, as you said, this has been going on for too long. And anyone selling now would be 3x up from the $USD low last year. Not a bad return if you have to present quarterly/yearly accounts...

[20-Jun-19 09:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well you do need to remember that there has been this cycle every few months, it only takes 1 or 2 cycles and you can make a lot of money

[20-Jun-19 09:24 AM] jansako#3330
Funny how you say that 'within' the ecosystem it is not diversifying, then in the next sentence you say how the prices of the ecosystem coins are not dependent on each other... it would be one or the other I should think 😃

[20-Jun-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
15k to 38k to 15k to 22k to 15k to 80k

[20-Jun-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
😛

[20-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jansako#3330
@hyperDEX if the market pressure is upward, you would spend your pump profits on price suppression real fast...

[20-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jansako#3330
daily volumes are still large enough that it would eat your profits

[20-Jun-19 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I have seen it all from 8k sats to 100k sats, there are cycles
