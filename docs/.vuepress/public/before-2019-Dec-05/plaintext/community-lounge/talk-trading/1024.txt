Caglio has a point. There is a lot of KMD tribalism/elitism here.

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Markus#5464
u know why tech is not a thing? Cause average joe investing dont give a shit ATM about tech until big names start using the tech what was spent so much time building and then the average joe starts to understand what the deal is

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Caglio#3337
and then we quote him

[06-Aug-19 01:19 PM] Caglio#3337

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus average joe in the US will be looking for tech come Sep

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
1 step ahead to crash ? or what ?

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Markus#5464
tech...well u have atomic dex, no regulation can stop it everyone can use it

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
noone will use it anyway

[06-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Caglio#3337
people dont even know there is something like that

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Markus#5464
they had 1k registrations if not more first week

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Caglio#3337
good

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Markus#5464
without any real hype about it

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Caglio#3337
of that 1k registrations

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Markus#5464
thats pretty damn good

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Caglio#3337
everyone is from this channel

[06-Aug-19 01:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
@meatspoon  it's not like other discords where you get banned for disagreeing. And atomic dex is open to every other project out there. thats not elitism

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We have 1k people talking here?

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
we have in the server

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
But it can also be bots or whatever

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Saying we are the best because we are the best shows we are stating the truth in tech/atomic swaps

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
If bots can trade money, they surely can register for something

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
We are the best in the steady decline and shitty market

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Caglio#3337
marketing*

[06-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Markus#5464
there is no real usecase to mass reg bots to a discord unless ur point is to spam DM

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Markus#5464
thats only thing that can benefit bots

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD is the best

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
Fuck the rest

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
:abusedsmily:

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
its ok

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
soon enough we will be able to play k64 games on our platform

[06-Aug-19 01:23 PM] Caglio#3337
that might helps us a bit

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is where you misunderstand @Caglio . Most here would welcome other projects with tech. It is the ones that dont and have nothing viable to add to crypto like Verge/Tron/LTC

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
actually that poker project is probably the best

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
CHIPS?

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
@actionslacks I am not saying it is pure elitism in here, but there are many here who deserve to eat some humble pie and get their balls busted by Caglio.

[06-Aug-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
Too bad all those coins you mentioned are way above us

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For now ðŸ˜ƒ

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Markus#5464
why does today matter

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Not verge LOL

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
dude forever

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Markus#5464
ETH was 9$ went to 1400 in 12 months

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah that is one project we constantly shit on here

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] Caglio#3337
we went from 15$ to 0.5 in a year

[06-Aug-19 01:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
And ETH is a shitcoin according to most in this channel

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah god forbid having eth over kmd

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
who did ever heard of ethereum

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ETH has scaling issues and multibillions to find a solution

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] dan.#2473
theres x maximalists in every discord

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Markus#5464
my point was how much u can realistically gain value in short amount of time, KMD can easy jump to 10$ in a couple of months with no issue

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
no issue ?

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes

[06-Aug-19 01:26 PM] Caglio#3337
kmd have issue  going from 1 buck to 1.20

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Right now the liquidity is flowing to BTC

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Flint#6435
and no good news and releases like Antara and DEX help the price at least stay at the same level - but on the contrary we are falling and falling, regardless of whether Bitcoin is growing or falling! we just fall no matter what!

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is not like every other alt is pumping and KMD is dumping

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Caglio#3337
@Flint thank you sir

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I learned and worked with open source tech in the days when people were ridiculing my choice of working on Linux over Windows doing System Admin jobs. I see similar patterns of debates about different cryptocurrency projects.

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We do a 10% we move up basically 10 spots, keep things in perspective

[06-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Caglio#3337
satinder I really respect you

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Caglio#3337
I never seen you shitting on anyone, therefore your voice have some meaning to me

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
glad to hear mate ðŸ™‚

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Caglio#3337
But honestly, over 90% people here are just brainwashed

[06-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Caglio#3337
And same way I annoy you with the facts, you annoy me with your blindness

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
top 10 tech, 20$ easily, bla bla

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
wake up

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't chat enough to decide on that percentage, but the chats I have done with dev community are not in that percentage of your mention.

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's my assessment.

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I dont even know who are devs

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I know you and jl

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's OK ðŸ˜„

[06-Aug-19 01:29 PM] Caglio#3337
and that audi guy

[06-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Flint#6435
when the komodo token begins to be used widely for exchange for cross-border payments to pay for coffee - then we will see growth - and now speculators and weak hands rule the ball

[06-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Caglio#3337
anyway, ta da for now

[06-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Caglio#3337
i will be here later to shit on kmd again

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No when KMD tech solves real problems like you know, DEX, that will be the best marketing we can get.

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
if someone uses it

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So instead of sitting here, why not complain about atomicDEX so you can actually add some value and improve it

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
if other dex get out

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
noone will use ours

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
so

[06-Aug-19 01:31 PM] Caglio#3337
you did nothing again

[06-Aug-19 01:32 PM] Caglio#3337
and thats like forever and in every aspect

[06-Aug-19 01:32 PM] dan.#2473
non troll thought, I am worried atomixdex, and what it can possibly solve with no kyc, will somehow have the US gov point their fingers at Apple and Google and ban the app. Apple and Google don't give a funk and will ban without thinking

[06-Aug-19 01:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Any ways you have wasted enough of my time, i will chose to build something for the incoming users looking for a WORKING DEX to migrate to.

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok make sure all those 72 users have a nice time there

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] Caglio#3337
with no scalability problems

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How can they ban a APK side loaded

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] dan.#2473
ok yer just being obtuse now man

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How can they ban a github app

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] dan.#2473
thats only android phones

[06-Aug-19 01:33 PM] Flint#6435
On June 9, the manipulators wanted us to believe in an endless native and the price was 0.0002203 satoshi, but a month later we made holes in all levels that gave hope
