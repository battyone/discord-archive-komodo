so it could prevent connectivity issues etc

[11-Apr-19 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Usually more important to stay updated when using native, but using latest version is always the best üòÉ

[11-Apr-19 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Komodo dump when btc rise, komodo dump when btc falls...

[11-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
WTB 50 BTC of KMD, dump to me

[11-Apr-19 08:30 AM] crumb#2550
komodo also dump with new tech. always remember 1/tech :abusedsmily:

[11-Apr-19 08:32 AM] crumb#2550
coingirl why worried? you are / have been a longterm holder. this too shall pass

[11-Apr-19 08:34 AM] coingirl87#6489
I only want to understand the sense. Why people sell kmd when btc rise ? Why people sell kmd when btc fall and why people sell kmd when team announced so much good stuff?

[11-Apr-19 08:35 AM] crumb#2550
in one word. bots

[11-Apr-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
bots are coded with fiat target price, and they seem to be biased to push the price lower

[11-Apr-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so with a 10 BTC bankroll on both sides of the bid and ask, as people buy and sell, the bid is gradually dropped. like boiling a frog

[11-Apr-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
then when the price is 30% below where it should be, a big buy eats all the sells that followed the bots down the lower prices

[11-Apr-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in other words, dont pay much attention to day to day prices, very much pushed around by forces that have ZERO interest in making it reflect the "real" price. of course, if enough people believe the bot pushed price, it becomes real

when entire market is like that the instructions to the bots are to suck out BTC from all the other coins and likely convert the BTC to fiat

[11-Apr-19 09:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Well I didn't sign up for that.

[11-Apr-19 09:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
How do I get off this ride?

[11-Apr-19 09:02 AM] coingirl87#6489
Thank you for explanation

[11-Apr-19 09:02 AM] Sherdogz#6731
@Cryptoon never mind in works againüëç

[11-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Sherdogz#6731
So what should be the "real price" atm

[11-Apr-19 09:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTC needs to at least retest the daily 200sma

[11-Apr-19 09:07 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont like the fact that it hasnt

[11-Apr-19 09:08 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also daily RSI needs to reset, at least reach 50 and bounce from there.

[11-Apr-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
when it dropped from 6k it didnt retest much for a long while

[11-Apr-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is sort of the reverse? though taking much longer time

[11-Apr-19 09:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It can correct sideways around $5k for some time and reset indicators that way too

[11-Apr-19 09:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It's what it did on the previous sideways before this pump

[11-Apr-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in a bull market, no reasons are needed for the price to go up

[11-Apr-19 09:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
IF this is a bull market.

[11-Apr-19 09:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
from past experience i can say we should not stay waiting for a lower low below december 2018 bottom. But who knows.

[11-Apr-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
one way to tell is if the price just goes up for no reason vs. down

[11-Apr-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
3150 seemed a pretty extreme low and with everyone sure it would head to 1500

[11-Apr-19 09:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i wont call thsi a bull market until 8/41 weekly crosses over.

[11-Apr-19 09:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, typical mentality of a bottom.

[11-Apr-19 09:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh the pump over 4.2k was because of short squeeze, no?

[11-Apr-19 09:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the same as the top... everyone was posting charts of how low it could go.

[11-Apr-19 09:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
both sides leveraged very high and it was a coordinated pump to squeeze shorts out of their positions?

[11-Apr-19 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not exactly

[11-Apr-19 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the pump over 4200 was because the resistance was 4200 and it got broken so many people closed shorts and bought.

[11-Apr-19 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"coordinate" is relative in a market.

[11-Apr-19 09:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A chart of a market is the perfect example of how present becomes past.

[11-Apr-19 09:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its easy to define the past, but the present is being written in front of us without ever being able to be sure how it will become the past.

[11-Apr-19 09:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Dont get me wrong... in terms of positioning, btc looks super bullish. Its on top of weekly upper bb, broke above weekly 41ema, bounced off weekly 200sma, volume has gone up with price.... etc.

[11-Apr-19 09:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
all of these are bullish signs, but need the confirmation of making a new support on a new height.

[11-Apr-19 09:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It already made support of the lows below $4200

[11-Apr-19 09:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is support right here.

[11-Apr-19 09:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But this is resistance and it needs force to break through it... and it needs to get it now, before breaking out

The Bitcoin Chart NOBODY is Seeing Right Now
There are some important signals on a chart of bitcoin that very few people are watching right now. What does it mean for BTC? We explain in this video. For ...
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UC04WfmZJh8/maxresdefault.jpg

[11-Apr-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Allessio thinks we are still in wave 4

[11-Apr-19 09:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is one theory, but again, history in btc says you should not sit and wait for a 5th wave on corrections

[11-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the truth is that nobody knows and nobody can be sure until it is obvious

[11-Apr-19 09:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And this "wave 4" seems to be extending  in rise and time enough to be almost invalidated

[11-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Markus#5464
there is so many different theories

[11-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the max it can rise before being invalidated?

[11-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
6kish?

[11-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Markus#5464
i have seen ppl saying that we could go to 6k, get rejected drop to 4k and repeat upwards creating a accumulation range between 4-6k

[11-Apr-19 09:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, $5800 - $6k should invalidate it being a wave 4

[11-Apr-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we could be the mirror of when we were at $15k after the $20k peak. at that moment people didnt know that it wouldnt just go back up again

[11-Apr-19 09:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
From my experience i would invalidate it from now, since btc never has 4th waves like this

[11-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Markus#5464
@siu - Chainmakers what do u think about stochastic being maxed on weekly

[11-Apr-19 09:31 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, i expected it to continue too. I failed on that top.

[11-Apr-19 09:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Stoch oscillates much faster than RSI and it could be easily reseted with a sideways correction.

[11-Apr-19 09:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We could get one last flash crash to retest a 3rd time the weekly 200sma

[11-Apr-19 09:34 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is the most plausible scenario given the sudden bullishness

[11-Apr-19 09:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Weekly 200sma is around $3800 now

[11-Apr-19 09:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That would be the ultimate troll both for bulls and bears

[11-Apr-19 09:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ultimate opportunity for institutions to not scoop, but dig out all coins possible

[11-Apr-19 09:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And it happened back in 2015 so its possible

[11-Apr-19 09:36 AM] Markus#5464
well i wouldnt be sad with a drop to 3800ish, already got buy orders at 3800 üòÑ

[11-Apr-19 09:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its not the same to say "i wouldnt" that "i am not"

[11-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Markus#5464
so u think its a possible scenario?

[11-Apr-19 09:38 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its on the table, yes.

[11-Apr-19 09:40 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also real trend change in btx happens with some bad news that become good somehow.

[11-Apr-19 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That news many wait in a bear market to keep selling, turns out to become a buy opportunity

[11-Apr-19 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Back in 2012 it was silk road being taken down

[11-Apr-19 09:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In 2015 if i remember correctly it was because of mtgox trial starting.

[11-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Markus#5464
well in my opinion we will have another visit to 3500ish but it wont be long lasted and then its begin of next uptrend

[11-Apr-19 09:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not sure what the catalyst this time around would be.

[11-Apr-19 09:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
China bans have no effect anymore

[11-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Still waiting for China mining ban effect lol

[11-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
then we have to remember the 2020 halvening , usually market start to trend upwards 1 year ahead of it

[11-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
so this dip would need to hurry up abit if it will be like that

[11-Apr-19 09:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe it can be that the feds capture the iranian guys that were doing the ransomware attacks to get paid in btc?

[11-Apr-19 09:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That could be some kind of catalyst news that people might interpret aa bullish

[11-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Markus#5464
actually china "want" to ban bitcoin mining haha

[11-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Markus#5464
just checked google

[11-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Markus#5464
"China wants to ban Bitcoin mining because it 'seriously wasted resources"

[11-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Markus#5464

@crumb snapshot/airdrop takes time, might vary in a few hours, assume 13th April 23:59:59 as a deadline

[11-Apr-19 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@kolo the main question seems to be 23:59:59 where?

[11-Apr-19 10:38 AM] kolo#1111
Deadline to get your funds in transparent wallet

[11-Apr-19 10:38 AM] Keppie#5156
Time zone he means

[11-Apr-19 10:38 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
