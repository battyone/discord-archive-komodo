1% of my stash would have been at the ‚Äúi have a $30k bag‚Äù price level, the rest would have hit single digit sats, so maybe $1000 in reality :abusedsmily:

I mean I don't keep coins on exchanges unless that exchange happens to get hacked and frozen while I'm trading into more KMD.

price went back to the green line. it overshot a bit, but realized it and is now oscillating around the 24hr, the recent pattern is to do that for a day or so and then go up about 5%

[15-May-19 07:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe alts get a little breather then

[15-May-19 07:11 AM] Malti#3948
