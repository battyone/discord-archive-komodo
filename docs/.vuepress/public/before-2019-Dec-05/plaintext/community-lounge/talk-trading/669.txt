Good trade if you caught that pump 😮

[21-May-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Do people buy coins they hate just for pumpability?

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
do people hate coins ?

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Just luck

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I would never touch BSV....

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or verge

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I didn't know I had it until 2 weeks ago

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or a crap load of other coins

[21-May-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
HAHA

[21-May-19 08:35 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Is that an acceptable excuse?

[21-May-19 08:35 PM] Bittersweet#9376
🐷

[21-May-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody that had BTC got BCH and then BSV

[21-May-19 08:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok that’s acceptable

[21-May-19 08:36 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Ah yes, I had bch (still do)

[21-May-19 08:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah i get that, more of a general question.

[21-May-19 08:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[21-May-19 08:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
lol

[21-May-19 08:42 PM] Tek#5253
@Cryptoon same

[21-May-19 08:42 PM] Tek#5253
I used to do what I like to call the "xrp/xlm" trick but it only works when there is hype for them

[21-May-19 08:43 PM] Tek#5253
> buy xrp/xlm with eur on kraken.
> send to binance
> pay $0.001 fee
> wait half an hour
> sell for 2% more BTC

[21-May-19 08:43 PM] Tek#5253
I did that like 10 times lmao

[21-May-19 08:43 PM] Tek#5253
but never have I ever held it

[21-May-19 08:43 PM] Tek#5253
> holding ripple or xlm

[21-May-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
im now donig the same thing but with BCH since the withdraw fees are low for it on Kraken

[21-May-19 08:44 PM] Tek#5253
but I tend to keep the BCH instead of trading it to BTC cause BTC suckx

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
tfw bought more KMD

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
I uess I have to double my collection amount

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
: D

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
for sure

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I've been thinking the entire day

[21-May-19 08:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
at what price I would sell some ARRR for more kmd

[21-May-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
i think this is a great buy in price

[21-May-19 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_still doesn't understand why people send shit back and forth to arb rather than just maintaining trading balances_

[21-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
imagine if whalebro wanted to buy 100k now

[21-May-19 08:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it takes quite some funds to keep trading balances on different exchanges @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[21-May-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`imagine if whalebro wanted to buy 100k now`
he would click twice and do it

[21-May-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it takes quite some funds to keep trading balances on different exchanges`
I believe the old folks used to call that "living within your means" 🤷🏽

[21-May-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
if they enable NANO on more exchanges its going to be THE bot coin

[21-May-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess if you count your time and activity as 0 value....

[21-May-19 08:58 PM] Tek#5253
under second transaction time + feeless

[21-May-19 08:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
there are so many exchanges and so many different trading pair combo's to arb

[21-May-19 08:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
even within your means it's not possible to keep relatively worthwhile pieces of your trading bankroll on each and every one of them

[21-May-19 08:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but I get what you mean

[21-May-19 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`there are so many exchanges and so many different trading pair combo's to arb`
yes, and by the time you count man hours moving shit around to make "2%", you really end up with a 0.5% loss

[21-May-19 09:00 PM] Tek#5253
🤔 dunno man I'm on benifits

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
so man hours don't matter

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
its also 80% of my last paycheck when I still worked

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
so why even work

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
ive been on benifts for 6 months now, just dumping it all in crypto

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
so confy

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so man hours don't matter`
Said every person who decided that they have no self-worth, ever

[21-May-19 09:01 PM] Tek#5253
> assuming things

[21-May-19 09:02 PM] Tek#5253
> projecting

[21-May-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
also no one arbitrages manually man you write a bot

[21-May-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

[21-May-19 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm neither projecting or assuming
If you say that your time has 0 value (which you literally did), then your self-worth (in context) is non-existent 
Because, words

[21-May-19 09:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is always an opportunity cost

[21-May-19 09:04 PM] Tek#5253
i think we have a misinterpretation possiby at my side

[21-May-19 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`also no one arbitrages manually man you write a bot`
If you had an arb bot, then you wouldn't be manually transferring shit and would have to dig through a shit ton of logs to even see that 2% move 🤷🏽

[21-May-19 09:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless physically unable to work for example

[21-May-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253

[21-May-19 09:07 PM] Tek#5253

I'm applying for "assistant manger" now

[21-May-19 09:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If I didnt have to pay that many taxes that would probably be a difference of several 100k a year for me though 😦

[21-May-19 09:09 PM] Tek#5253
