as long as newbs can be convinced to sell, the price will stay low

[23-Apr-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
once the volume dries up, then the price will go higher

[23-Apr-19 06:42 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Good Info also advice from my friend : neither it's a liquidity play to usually sell into or acquire, either way it's probably bad to trade that as there is no true edge in something like that unless you're reading the tape

ZEC/BTC just hit a new all-time-low in the last few minutes

[23-Apr-19 06:55 PM] jl777c#5810

[23-Apr-19 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is the new king. nothing else matters. dump city

[23-Apr-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if this causes you to panic, then reduce your exposure

[23-Apr-19 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD at -3% against BTC is one of the better performing ones and climbed a few spots on CMC, any maybe a few pennies USD

[23-Apr-19 07:02 PM] mrlynch#5735

KMD sure is crushed, up 3 cents (2.857%) this week
damn the bad luck
If this trend continues, we'll only 2x in a year 😡

[23-Apr-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or KMD must not be an altcoin

[23-Apr-19 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🙂

[23-Apr-19 09:21 PM] altcoinist#1501
Kmd still does better than most other coins

[23-Apr-19 09:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

@Deleted User alts are already 30-40 % down against btc. I don't think that it would be good time to sell now as it won't last longer. Maybe I'm wrong but in crypto everything can happen 😃

[23-Apr-19 09:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

_doesn't remember because he was just a poor blue-collar bastid back then_

[23-Apr-19 10:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
its coming and I think crypto will follow accordingly

[23-Apr-19 10:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I highly doubt a second bull run of crypto before a recession.

[23-Apr-19 10:52 PM] phm87#7395
After the .com bubble, about 10 years were needed for the sector to recover. I don't know for crypto

Klein your basically hoping for the impossible it's an absolute and overdue. Better to get it earlier than later; last thing I want is for it cause Dark Ages in countries.

And cheer this madness on

[23-Apr-19 11:12 PM] klein#5233
(I never said no big stockmarket crash, ever)

[23-Apr-19 11:59 PM] richardt#2807
It seems the only thing that's been consistent in crypto is that the market goes up with every bitcoin halving.  But that's just a correlation.  No one can say for sure it will happen again with the next halving.

[24-Apr-19 01:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Each halving should have less significance given the supply being almost all mined now

[24-Apr-19 02:23 AM] jspook16#3059
