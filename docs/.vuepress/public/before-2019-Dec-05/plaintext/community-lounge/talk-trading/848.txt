every single altcoin discord is having complaints about marketing, when BTC dominance is rising, alt coin prices goes down in satoshis. that is the definition of BTC dominance

what? KMD is above verge

[26-Jun-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
kmd will again go all time high and then again will go low. this is the cycle.

[26-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought verge has very good marketing, how can kmd be above it?

[26-Jun-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when it will go all time high, that won't be certainly because of KMD's marketing....

[26-Jun-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
All time high is not the marketing.

[26-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
also KMD is #43 on CMC coins list

[26-Jun-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this whole CMC points and positions on solely based on it's market value is wrong. Many experts in industry complained about it's positions and valuation this way.

Mass adoption when is this going to happen? i still don't see many people using blockchain. Companies are getting in to it governments also.

[26-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
an easy to use atomic swap is a key part of the equation

[26-Jun-19 09:43 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Consider having a look at VerusCoin and the PBaaS developments, if contemplating switching ecosystems... üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
especially with all the regulations, it will be one of the only regulation safe harbours, though you still will have to file every single transaction in some jurisdictions. at least you will be able to do the swaps without anybody giving you permission

[26-Jun-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
in parallel getting more and more projects into the ecosystem is another key part of the equation

Stupid is back

[26-Jun-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
we perform well with those two areas, then when BTC dominance drops back below 50%, and alt season kicks off, then KMD will be doing just fine

[26-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Malti#3948
are new projects in the ecosystem in the pipeline actually?

[26-Jun-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i would assume so. nobody needs our permission and the docs at https://kmd.io is pretty good
