Was on holiday for the past week, got back home, immediately to realise how I missed drinking good coffee and how hard it is to find places with good coffee

@Cryptoon what's your prep look like? I recommend using good spring or well water.

[08-Nov-18 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bottled spring water

[08-Nov-18 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Beans most important though

[08-Nov-18 09:49 AM] Lumbi#8378

@Cryptoon there's some cheap high-tech German air roasters on the market. IOT it up and have some fun. Roasting is where the science is.

Decentralized crypto exchanges will be charged for the distribution of unregistered securities in the US if they operate in the US.

A big blow to "decentralized" exchanges. In the coming months, we will see how many of the "decentralized" exchanges are actually decentrali...

"SEC charges EtherDelta founder with operating an unregistered exchange -- its the agency's "first enforcement action based on findings that such a platform operated as an unregistered national securities exchange."

[08-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if it is decentralized

[08-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
who will they charge

[08-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Lumbi alas I already have a lot of stuff going on, so don't really have the time to start looking into that 😄

True DEX participants will probably be charged individually

[08-Nov-18 04:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you have sells and buys listed, you’re the exchange

[08-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Does EtherDelta have KYC?

[08-Nov-18 05:06 PM] meatspoon#7860
How would the authoritaaays know who was using it?

[08-Nov-18 05:29 PM] Lumbi#8378
ED was a shitty exchange, the working ones are in working locations apparently.

[08-Nov-18 05:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’ll go full NSA on your ass to keep the plebs in line

[08-Nov-18 05:30 PM] Lumbi#8378
That's pretty much par for the course; or did they stop doing something?

[08-Nov-18 05:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
One of the other projects that i am excited about is CryptoBridge. No KYC (ever) no limits on withdrawals or deposits. Once they have federated gateways up, there will be virtually no way a government entity can stop it.

[08-Nov-18 05:32 PM] retto#3664
kmd touching the bottom of the cup...should be going up for a bit if it holds its shape which it has since april

[08-Nov-18 05:32 PM] retto#3664
@meatspoon  whats a federated gateway?

[08-Nov-18 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Basically a node that puts up a bunch of collateral to ensure it doesnt act maliciously. So different gateways will be for different coins

[08-Nov-18 05:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
That is my layman’s interpretation of it. All gateways must act cooperatively within the federation or lose their stakes

[08-Nov-18 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
They are already one of the largest DEX’s out there and they are adding ETH support followed by ERC-20 tokens, then stable coins and cryptonote protocols.

[08-Nov-18 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
Profits are decentralized too. Ownership of a native token determines what share of trading fees/profits are distributed, paid in BTC every two weeks. Its an elegant system

[08-Nov-18 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
Gut?

[08-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Lumbi#8378
DE for 'good'

[08-Nov-18 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ahh, i agree then. Mostly shitcoins for the moment, but all that is changing.

[08-Nov-18 05:39 PM] Lumbi#8378
RVN is there... TLY soon 😉

[08-Nov-18 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, that might have been the first exchange to list RVN. There are definitely some peanuts in the shit pile.

[08-Nov-18 05:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
They also have a legal team that reviews all coins prior to listing to make sure that (for the time being) none can be considered securities. Once the federated gateways are up, though, it may not matter anymore.

[08-Nov-18 05:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yup

[08-Nov-18 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
Shitcoins gotta pay. Devs gotta put hours in for every shitcoin, get wallets sorted out and whatnot.

[08-Nov-18 05:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
I would imagine that fee will disappear entirely with federated gateways. Anyone with sufficient collateral will be able to run a gateway.  Different gateways for different coins.

[08-Nov-18 05:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
Gateways will collect fees generated from that specific coin, i believe.

[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
The incentives are all pretty well thought out. The exchange takes no fees right now other than the 2 btc listing fees. All other fees are given back to bco stakers and market makers.

[08-Nov-18 07:06 PM] wolfgang#3508
@meatspoon   yeh. Love CB.. Just have to boast I was the 632'nd staker of bco lol

been amazing to see it grow over the past year

[08-Nov-18 07:09 PM] wolfgang#3508
on a side note. Noticed the securities discussion above...

[08-Nov-18 07:09 PM] wolfgang#3508
little confused about how it all works. Isn't SEC based in the US?  So if someone launches something that could according to them be considered a secuirty in some place like South East Asia.  Do they have a right to shut them down>

[08-Nov-18 07:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
@wolfgang  I am envious.  I was late to the party.  I started dollar cost averaging into BCO about halfway thru this year.  Very excited for what the future holds for BCO.  Passive income coins tickle me in all the right places.

{Reactions}
💯 

[08-Nov-18 07:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
Good question, I am not sure.  I would imagine there are lots of ways that the SEC can apply pressure outside of the US borders (in addition to it being very FUD'y if the SEC singles a project out).  The SEC could probably lean on whatever government to try and get them to do their bidding.  So CB's solution I think has a good shot.  The devs are anonymous and they are trying to make it so they can completely step away from the project and just let the gateways handle things.  So in theory, a gateway could get shut down if it were in a jurisdiction controlled or influenced by the SEC... but that would be just one coin on an exchange and someone on the other side of the world could reopen that same coin/gateway.

[08-Nov-18 07:14 PM] wolfgang#3508
which is amazing

[08-Nov-18 07:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
or I suppose the SEC could go after Bitshares, but that network might be too robust at this point to bring it to heel.  The future is going to be very interesting to watch

[08-Nov-18 07:14 PM] wolfgang#3508
a lot of people fail to realize what CB is capable of

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
on a side note speaking of interesting projects, you heard of Haven Protocol? XHV?

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
Been mining them for a while aswell

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have.  its hard for me to wrap my mind around

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
likewise

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
Im just accumulating

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
been mining RVN, XHV and KMD

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
for a good 6months now

[08-Nov-18 07:15 PM] wolfgang#3508
lol

[08-Nov-18 07:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
nice.  Stepollo, one of the CB team turned me on to ARO.  been mining that

[08-Nov-18 07:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
how is the XHV miner?  is it pretty easy or does it require a lot of tinkering?

[08-Nov-18 07:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
May have just answered my own question with a search...  XMR stak looks like

[08-Nov-18 07:21 PM] snowdamn#2414
all loopholes end as soon as there is need to convert back to fiat
they can simply say you can't present exchanges from DEX as source  (if not that they are outright illegal)

[08-Nov-18 07:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think I understand your first statement, and I agree for the time being.

[08-Nov-18 07:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
in your second, are you saying that the IRS or SEC would say that someone filing taxes can't submit trades made on a DEX or that they could just make DEX's illegal?

[08-Nov-18 07:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, i'm saying that they can simply do the former
if they don't make it outright illegal

[08-Nov-18 07:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, i am no lawyer (nor am I a rocket surgeon), but I don't think it would be in the IRS's best interest to tell people they werent allowed to voluntarily declare income.  As for making something illegal, I think Congress has to do that.  The SEC can apply pressure and make claims that organizations are not in compliance, but I don't think the SEC typically goes after individuals that arent whales

[08-Nov-18 07:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
so if a DEX has millions of users, the SEC is going to go after the DEX, not the users, right?

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, SEC doesn't make the laws and its jurisdiction is to go after owners, operators, beneficiaries, etc.

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
on the corporation level

[08-Nov-18 07:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
fair enough, just as a police officer's job is to go after, say, drug dealers... but they don't typically mess with an individual who has a dime bag in his pocket

[08-Nov-18 07:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
so in the example that wolfgang and i were making, that of CryptoBridge, its hard to guess how the SEC might try to apply pressure.

[08-Nov-18 07:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
i was talking from a user perspective
sorry if i changed subject

[08-Nov-18 07:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, thats ok.  Obviously, as a user, i am very interested in that perspective too

[08-Nov-18 07:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
for me, i will be reporting my BCO staking payouts with my taxes.  I am curious to see how my accountant handles it.  She is gonna hate me.

[08-Nov-18 07:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
right now i think the IRS is playing catch-up.  I think the people who declare their crypto income aren't gonna get messed with much and I doubt the IRS will be taking note of different exchanges (yet).  My hope is that CryptoBridge (and other DEX's) get off the ground and become essentially unstoppable before the alphabet soup agencies even take note of their existence

[08-Nov-18 07:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
and if cryptos truly get adopted, those who HODL might not have to worry much if all BTC wallets end up having privacy features or if privacy coins get adopted

[08-Nov-18 07:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
if all cryptos become untraceable, they are essentially like cash.  Vendors who accept them will then have the choice of reporting or not

[08-Nov-18 07:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
and the consumer will be pretty empowered

[08-Nov-18 07:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
they're fighting a losing battle
because they're trying to fit crypto into the old finance infrstructure and tax accordingly
but this cannot happen because of the most important feature of crypto...  ability to control wallets!
