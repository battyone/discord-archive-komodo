you can see that hte market is irrational just by looking at the fact that BTC is the biggest by a huuuuuuge amrgin

margin

[29-May-19 04:53 PM] Mische#6695
It would be nice to 51% attack all of them and let them burn

[29-May-19 04:53 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
who would we notarize to then

[29-May-19 04:53 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
not a good promotion for blockchain tech as a whole if every project gets attacked

[29-May-19 04:53 PM] Mische#6695
Ok let’s keep btc being btc

[29-May-19 04:54 PM] Mische#6695
Verge #51, KMD #52 right now - verge got 51% and KMD protects

[29-May-19 04:55 PM] Mische#6695
This is fucked up

and lets not forget about XRP at #3

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I may be stupid, but I can math

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] Mische#6695
Cryptoreddit also got too toxic since bubble pop, can’t promote KMD there, anything besides NANO gets downvoted to hell

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
ZEC at like 25 while ARRR is at like 250

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
fuckn ridiculous

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
we should 1000x every KMD, so the verge moon boys go "oh it's only $0.001? it has so much room to grow"

[29-May-19 04:56 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If eth solves its problems its going be worth as much as btc in market cap or more... 🔮

[29-May-19 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
that is honestly why I think XVG is as high as it is, new traders not understanding wth marketcap is

[29-May-19 04:57 PM] Mische#6695
Yeah I remember that time every coin with a low price got pumped like hell

[29-May-19 04:58 PM] Mische#6695
Sort by price and it was also sorted by gains lol

[29-May-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
@FlyingDutchman first mover doesn't necessarily have to be the best competitor

[29-May-19 04:58 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
lets get kmd to $10k in 10 years

[29-May-19 04:59 PM] Mische#6695
Let’s make KMD outperform the rest of the market :troll_hurt:

[29-May-19 04:59 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
that, but while the market as a whole is still outperforming itself

[29-May-19 04:59 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
thus, performance sqiared

[29-May-19 05:00 PM] Mische#6695
I mean it’s possible

[29-May-19 05:00 PM] Mische#6695
CG just does some math and boom KMD #1

[29-May-19 05:00 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

`CG just does some math and boom KMD #1`

[29-May-19 05:05 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
courts gonna rule that zooko has to pay alimony in KMD

[29-May-19 05:06 PM] Mische#6695
She suffered from schizophrenia, depression and more and got it healed by eating nothing but animal products, mostly beef

[29-May-19 05:06 PM] Mische#6695

[29-May-19 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I want to live somewhere where 20 people disappear, they all have delivering to your address in common, and no one even questions it

[29-May-19 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

We got another countdown

[29-May-19 05:37 PM] Mische#6695
I think the last one was the brown sheet video right ?

[29-May-19 05:39 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Dash doesnt have tech, it only has marketing videos with girls in them.    And therefore it has a high marketcap, because price = 1/tech.

[29-May-19 05:39 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i missed a lot of messages, i thought i was replying to the most recent ones lol

[29-May-19 05:40 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Tek should trade his KMD for Dash then 😛

[29-May-19 05:42 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
wait barterdex is coming out on June 1?!

[29-May-19 05:42 PM] Mische#6695
The link from reddit doesn‘t seem official

[29-May-19 05:43 PM] Mische#6695
But I will definetly try next barterDEX

[29-May-19 05:43 PM] Mische#6695
Had no luck with the last one

[29-May-19 05:44 PM] Mische#6695
I think it took me 3 hours to get 4 small trades with pizza/beer

[29-May-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
I hope they add decentralized margin trading to barterdex later.....that would be a killer

[29-May-19 05:44 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they honestly just need a super sexy gui

[29-May-19 05:45 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
a lot of people get turned off from new services cuz the guis arent as developed as the tech

[29-May-19 05:45 PM] Mische#6695
I am still erect when I‘m thinking of the liquidity multiplier

[29-May-19 05:46 PM] Mische#6695
Get all the fat finger !

[29-May-19 05:46 PM] Markus#5464
Still wondering if u can trade any pair u wish or if there is a set of pairs

[29-May-19 05:46 PM] Mische#6695
And pair will be possible I think

[29-May-19 05:46 PM] Mische#6695
And you can put the same coins into different orders until the first one hits

[29-May-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
We will see how well it will perform liquidity wise

[29-May-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
cause  i assume there is no order books?

[29-May-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
that is visible for ppl

[29-May-19 05:48 PM] Mische#6695
There were orderbooks in mm1

[29-May-19 05:49 PM] Mische#6695
And with the liquidity multiplier liquidity shouldn‘t be a problem

[29-May-19 05:49 PM] Mische#6695
Especially if Auto pegging cmc prices or something like that will run smoothly

[29-May-19 05:49 PM] Alright#0419
the margin trading thing has nothing to do with barterdex

[29-May-19 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
#kmdlabs is launching a chain with prices CC sometime this week, margin trading on LABS

[29-May-19 05:50 PM] Markus#5464
Yea i know its a complete different thing i just meant it would be amazing to have those 2 in 1 place

[29-May-19 05:50 PM] Alright#0419
Tony put together a nice web UI for it, so should be pretty noob friendly

[29-May-19 05:50 PM] Markus#5464
hm interesting

[29-May-19 05:50 PM] Markus#5464
will have to check it out later then 😄

[29-May-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
going long on kmd will probably end up making u a killing if it goes to its true valuation

[29-May-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
@Alright will there later on be apis available ?

[29-May-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
it's entirely api based

[29-May-19 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
but we have a web ui on top of it for less technical people

[29-May-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
so u can build ur own margin trading bot connected to it?

[29-May-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
yes, what we're launching this week is more of a testing phase though. You can get a taste for it, but we wouldn't recommend large amounts for now

[29-May-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
the way LABS is setup, if you find a bug, you can make a "bounty claim" to our notary nodes and get paid in LABS for it

[29-May-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
Alright sounds great

[29-May-19 06:30 PM] Tek#5253
I bought some IOTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

[29-May-19 06:30 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 06:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
lol! 👯 👯 👯

[29-May-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
I bought a small bag just in case it moons all the way to $1

[29-May-19 06:31 PM] Tek#5253
also bought RVN

[29-May-19 06:31 PM] LocoMB#8593
hold on to them- they were @ 35k Sat already, and should go there again, and beyond! 🌝

[29-May-19 06:32 PM] Tek#5253
yes I plan too hold these for long term
