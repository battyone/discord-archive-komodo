10% is not any pump.

[29-Aug-18 03:20 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
very soft upward correction

[29-Aug-18 03:28 PM] shnu#0359
an undervalued project rising 10% or even 20% is not a pump. HODL till you see those double-triple digits.

BTC will go sideways for a while with ups and downs until capitulation happens

lol people calling a 10 % increase a pump

[29-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Buddz1993#5380

Why would GMO Internet switch all mining capacity to $BTC from $BCH? Only ~$37,867 for one hour 51% $BCH attack? Does DARI ratio account for block maturation times? Nov fork? What could possibly happen with this $9B testnet? Sure is fun to watch! 😂 💩 https://t.co/2P5...

@vin_thetown @monerotrader @WattCrypto @TraceMayer @rogerkver $kmd Komodo can notarize all of these BTC forks to $BTC for the measly fee of 300KMD/yr.

That will solve your 51% dilemma

Since peercoin

[30-Aug-18 12:17 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think it's been five years now. Peercoin still needed miners with it so it was half way there.

I don't know much, but that usually means the stock market is in for a big correction soon

[30-Aug-18 09:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its nigh 😄

[30-Aug-18 10:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You know whar has not done a ATH? DOW

[30-Aug-18 10:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Which is not a good sign since dow should lead.

[30-Aug-18 10:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And yes... its due to have the biggest correction ever in history.

I have been looking for a way to plot S&P without FAANG

[30-Aug-18 11:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I read an article that would be a good way to see when the bull is ending

[30-Aug-18 11:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
FAANG is now worth as much as the sum of the bottom 250 in the S&P 500

[30-Aug-18 11:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you lost me there.

[30-Aug-18 12:03 PM] jorian#4555

[30-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers I meant if you were to calculate the value of the S&P500 without it taking into account the FAANG stocks, then you could already see the graph flattening, meaning the bullrun is actually ending

[30-Aug-18 12:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ahhh okok

[30-Aug-18 12:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
FAANG is Faceboom amazon apple netflix google

I tried to plot SPX-AAPL-GOOGL-... in tradingview but then realized it just substracted the absolute values of those stocks, and the SPX itself is a weighted index

[30-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Otherwise this would be it without FAANG 😄

[30-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But it's not that simple

[30-Aug-18 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that would be similar to removing BTC from the overall crypto index

[30-Aug-18 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah something like that

[30-Aug-18 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
except not really, because when btc goes up alts go up in usd as well. While this is not necessarily the case for FAANG and the rest of the S&P

[30-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, the article said it was a good indicator of predicting the end of the bull as FAANG skews the results of SPX too much

[30-Aug-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weird part of this is that the DOW is still lagging and SPX and NASDAQ are already in ATH

[30-Aug-18 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
normally its the contrary

[30-Aug-18 01:27 PM] stealth#9257
When is the Kmd rebrand and what will that actually mean?

[30-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Bittersweet#9376
Hahahhahaha

[30-Aug-18 02:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers I think it has to do with cheap money being available and companies in the s&p that are generally more prone to overinvesting by PE firms?
