[30-May-19 08:24 PM] Alexfrog#1338
btc will alternate up and down $500, and KMD will tank another 10% each time until KMD at 0

[30-May-19 08:24 PM] jorian#4555
btc up: kmd down
btc down: kmd down

[30-May-19 08:24 PM] jorian#4555
let's call it a healthy retracement for KMD

[30-May-19 08:25 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[30-May-19 08:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is there any actual liquidity on binance for KMD

[30-May-19 08:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No wonder the price fluctuates or dumps, no real market

[30-May-19 08:51 PM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 08:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I hodl, i don‚Äôt generate taxable income via trade

[30-May-19 08:55 PM] Alexfrog#1338
The best thing about coins like KMD that only ever go down is that they generate no taxable income, only losses üòÑ

[30-May-19 08:56 PM] Tek#5253
if a single trade is a taxable event where you live than you are not a free man
