btc bouncing back to $4K

[25-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a feeling that most people still hodling will also hold to 2k sort to speak

[25-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I doubt retail investors can have this much effect on price

[25-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So must be a bigger game with large whales dumping

[25-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Possibly buying otc dumping on market to buy more otc cheaply

[25-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As jl alluded to a couple of times

[25-Nov-18 11:27 AM] demols#8610

Is just a healthy correction. :abusedsmily:

[25-Nov-18 12:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So 4 days of sideways to come then we test 3k dead

[25-Nov-18 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@demols the couple of btc mined everyday is peanuts compared to total volume of btc traded...

>Is just a healthy correction. abusedsmily
It seems like we are on the unhealthy part of the correction now

[25-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

If you take out the parabolic, there's nothing "bad" about BTC living in the 3200-4600 range

[25-Nov-18 12:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

You don't have to nail the end of the cycle to know that buying KMD sub-$1 is going to pay dividends down the road.

[25-Nov-18 03:02 PM] Cassius#9158
I mean all crypto. And you don't have to call it perfectly, just be vaguely contrarian. In practice, 90% of people aren't.

`why is binance wallet under maintenance?`
Because their helpdesk was caught up, not doing any work, and someone decided to create an issue to put them back to work

[25-Nov-18 06:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
Genie selling/deposit or buying/withdrawal? 🤔

[25-Nov-18 07:04 PM] Vertigo#0439
KMD is doing pretty terrible ... Compared to others.

Coinbase's last round - Lead investor is Tiger Global. These guys are hyper focused on tech and rarely lose money. Same guys who invested in airbnb, uber, stripe, square, netflix, facebook etc...

@AndrewK you do know binance's kmd wallet is under maintenance right?

[26-Nov-18 02:30 AM] AndrewK#3947
@bishop yea they won't show you the deposit address, but I have the address saved somewhere. Not sure if they will register it or not if I sent KMD over there.

[26-Nov-18 02:32 AM] ph03nix#3115

_hopes that they lose the db to every address linked to any account where someone knowingly sends to an exchange when the exchange says not to send_

[26-Nov-18 02:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, "needing" to dump (at 1/2 the price it was last week) in order to "pay bills" is a sure sign that you're over-extended and should rethink your process

@AndrewK you do know that if a daemon is offline, it doesn't matter if you have your address or not, nothing is going to be credited

[26-Nov-18 02:41 AM] bishop#9773
...until the daemon is back in sync

[26-Nov-18 02:42 AM] AndrewK#3947
Or its called operating like a responsible commodities producer and taking profits when prices are still above costs and not gambling on intra-weekly volatility.

[26-Nov-18 02:44 AM] AndrewK#3947
Its ok for people to have different goals and operational models, @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

Tbh at this point I dont see the harm in even waiting a couple of days before you sell to pay costs

BTC's looking like it didn't want to bounce hard. Thinking it could be another leg down and maybe that's where to grab some bargain-basement KMD.

[26-Nov-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
