Thanks jl üòÉ

[15-May-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
its just a 24hr average from the DTO (decentralized trustless oracle) chain

[15-May-19 07:13 AM] Malti#3948
Eth made an 8% jump overnight so I hope this is a small taste of alt season reelin in

[15-May-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
no guarantee that the whales will keep using this, so be careful. it is useful to see when they change their pattern. I think when they do, we will finally see the normal correction everybody knows should happen

[15-May-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the BTC price is no with any weight, you cant buy any big amounts of KMD at current prices

[15-May-19 07:14 AM] Malti#3948
I put a stop loss now

[15-May-19 07:15 AM] Malti#3948
Binance trading still interrupted till 5pm or something tonite? (Belgian time)

[15-May-19 07:16 AM] Malti#3948
8k seems like a stabilizer really

[15-May-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810

The system upgrade has now begun & trading has been suspended.

The upgrade will take approximately 6-8 hours.

There will be a 30-minute window to cancel orders, process deposits, withdrawals & use other account related functions before trading resumes.

@jl777c any plans to bring back the kmdbtcchart from the slack days?

[15-May-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some day, that was indeed useful and calming

[15-May-19 07:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah, buy when graph curves up, sell when curve down

[15-May-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810

the 30 minute window where people can manage their orders has started

[15-May-19 12:30 PM] Malti#3948
so in 30 mins binance live

[15-May-19 12:32 PM] Malti#3948
50k BNB will be distributed for the inconvenience

[15-May-19 12:33 PM] Malti#3948
All users with valid trading volume of 1 BTC or more (buy & sells) across any trading pairs on Binance during the promotion period will split a pool of 50,000 BNB.

[15-May-19 12:36 PM] Malti#3948
so by trading you can earn your right to claim a part of the BNB

[15-May-19 12:36 PM] Malti#3948
by paying fees, you can earn a small chunk back basically

[15-May-19 12:36 PM] Malti#3948

So Binance did maintenance but did not disclose what happened in the hack, I am even more skeptical now.

the 30 minute timespan where peopel can manage orders

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
that annoys me

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
basically Binance gets a view of what the market will do,

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
doesn't this all seem like a big scam?

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
so they have 30 mins to set their orders to counter it

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
and run away with the most profit

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
I say this as a miner who very very rarely dabbles in exchanges

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
This all seems like a massive massive scam

[15-May-19 12:56 PM] Malti#3948
let's say this profit will be around 7000 btc +

[15-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
Binance and MtGox have a lot more in common than people would like to think

[15-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
MtGox wished it had it's own shitcoin like BNB

[15-May-19 12:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
Binance is a more evil, more financially optimized MtGox

[15-May-19 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
tradingvolume will be HUUUGE

[15-May-19 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
expect them to make the 7k BTC back in no-time

[15-May-19 12:58 PM] Malti#3948
i set my sell orders on trex

[15-May-19 12:58 PM] Malti#3948
hope the difference between them won't be too big

[15-May-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
high probability binance will go down for a while because of high traffic tbh :p
