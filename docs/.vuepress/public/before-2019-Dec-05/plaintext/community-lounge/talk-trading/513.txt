if the sole saving grace of currencyX were that currencyY had value against currencyA, then currencyX actually has a 0 value

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you wouldnt change the sex right ?

[03-Apr-19 11:20 PM] richardt#2807
Without BTC, there wouldn't even be a KMD....

[03-Apr-19 11:20 PM] p.#1126
i dont see people swapping KMD for large amounts of FIAT in swap groups, I do see BTC though. maybe one day there bud

[03-Apr-19 11:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I would like to change all my KMD for fiat

[03-Apr-19 11:20 PM] Caglio#3337

[03-Apr-19 11:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` Just don't get what's with all the hate for BTC around here`
for me it's on a technical level, but what I initially said has no animus (just a simple stating that for crypto to work then there needs to not being an absolute cross-pegging of value to any one crypto)

[03-Apr-19 11:21 PM] Caglio#3337
Or 20$

[03-Apr-19 11:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Without BTC, there wouldn't even be a KMD....`
And without 15 other cryptos before it, there would be no BTC
Bitcoin solved 1 problem, long ago, it's solved now move on

[03-Apr-19 11:23 PM] p.#1126
move on

[03-Apr-19 11:23 PM] p.#1126
good timing

[03-Apr-19 11:23 PM] richardt#2807
Ok.  Can you tell the rest of the market to also move on so our KMD's can be worth much more?

[03-Apr-19 11:23 PM] p.#1126
must be rich beyond measure

[03-Apr-19 11:23 PM] richardt#2807

do believe we will see BTC's market share continue to drop as long as core is at the helm

[03-Apr-19 11:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Well in that case, if we're looking for a de-coupling then may not happen in our lifetime

[03-Apr-19 11:26 PM] Caglio#3337

[03-Apr-19 11:31 PM] Alright#0419
I think the only realistic way to decouple from BTC would be to fork BTC into a million pieces

[03-Apr-19 11:32 PM] Alright#0419
and have large support for each

[03-Apr-19 11:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
economically you can't fork BTC into 2 pieces, thanks to Coinbase and lemmings 😕

[03-Apr-19 11:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I've always told people who are skeptics about crypto that in the end, it will not be our generation that will mass adopt crypto, it will likely be the next generations.  The reality is crypto is aiming to replace institutions that have been in place for generations.  I think it's wrong to compare it to the internet or email.  The internet or email didn't try to replace any major institutions

[03-Apr-19 11:40 PM] p.#1126
so you send letters in envelopes still

[03-Apr-19 11:41 PM] Alright#0419
just imagine if we had a well established alternative to debt based economy in 2008

[03-Apr-19 11:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's 1500 steps between not seeing BTC as "the" currency and mass addoption

[03-Apr-19 11:56 PM] Alright#0419
BCH has much more potential for mass adoption than BTC, not a shit coin

[03-Apr-19 11:56 PM] Alright#0419

[04-Apr-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
BTC has hard forked numerous times. the "original bitcoin" no longer exists

[04-Apr-19 12:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC solved 1 problem, a decade ago; what has it done since?

[04-Apr-19 12:00 AM] Alright#0419
BCH is the closest thing to the "original bitcoin" tech wise

[04-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it has increased my fiat  value 😄
