`Remember the good ole days when arrr was cheap..`
It's currently at 14% **of** the price I last sold OTC at...
As Carly Simon once said, "these are the good old days"

IEO Playbook:

1) Sell low % of supply in IEO (6% or less)
2) Quick pump once trading starts
3) Slow decline after

All IEO's are down >20% from their price high after trading commenced. Good for a quick buck I guess 🤷‍♂️

Almost all cryptocurrency related news are positive

[22-Apr-19 04:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I bought Arrrr at .1 - .14 - .18 and .2 
I was concerned long term and admit fomoing in a bit.

[22-Apr-19 04:28 AM] FishyGuts#5085

the bull market is almost certainly back as indeed the press is 180 degrees from almost all being negative to almost all being positive. this process to "reeducate" the masses so they throw money into crypto means we are in the next cycle

[22-Apr-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810

Kraken listing cosmos, so called "Supernet competitin" I think it claims to be

[22-Apr-19 09:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Most people are probably wondering wtf supernet is

[22-Apr-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
they actually say "SuperNET competition"?

What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain interoperability project based on the Tendermint consensus protocol. Cosmos and Tendermint aim to provide a fast and highly scalable consensus protocol and reduce the time and complexity involved in building Blockchain applications, providing a stable interface for popular programming languages. Cosmos comprises a decentralized network of independent, parallel blockchains, each powered by the core consensus protocol, with constituent and derivative blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem understood as “zones” operating in proximity to the principal. ATOM is the token powering the main Cosmos Hub.

I dont remember if they says so, but I remember years ago some people discussing it that way/ dont remember who

[22-Apr-19 09:09 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
anyway funny they are 1800 place on CMC as CMC cannot recognize their tokens supply current, which is "bonded" I think in explorer about 120 mln, almos 5$ each which is 0.6  billion $ today

[22-Apr-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
well they implement a subset of what komodo offers, and it seems they did a decent job

[22-Apr-19 09:11 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
interesting will be to see any price effect, while being 0.6 B $ cap they are 1800 on the list

KMD inflation rate was only around half the maximum reward rate mentioned recently?

[22-Apr-19 10:50 AM] klein#5233
would be good data to have a dexstats.info

[22-Apr-19 10:51 AM] klein#5233
monthly/quarterly/yearly inflation rate

[22-Apr-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the rpc call automatically calculates the raw numbers so it should be possible

[22-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe even can be extrapolated forward to see what the likely supply is at 7777777, the true max possible would be 0.415% more than the exact supply at 7777777

[22-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, but there is a tail emission of 2KMD for the following 7777777 blocks and then 1KMD, which means in 1000 years there might be close to a billion KMD

[22-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
all a very small change to total lifetime emission and a negligible inflation rate, but as long as KMD value becomes reasonable, still enough to fund NN forever

In the beginning, we thought that the advent of this trend was a technological advance. It seemed as if it served as a component of a large ecosystem of blockchain and combined with each other to create technological/social values. however, the development of technology and the diversification/multiplexing of technology are completely different concepts. Since blockchain is a protocol based on machine-to-machine communication, it cannot be considered progress unless it is a single protocol. 

nevertheless, now the most promising time in the blockchain industry than in the past six years. I don't think to ruin party, but I think I was drunk for a while. the more I get to know, the more grand this technology is than I thought, and it's worth spending the time and effort ahead. this time may be the only chance to focus on the essence.

just judging how lawyers present em on meetings and are busy handling this, I don t know on other places but things are evolving here and not only in france, like spreading, but what we see here as very slow is like a speedrun for em, and all of em begin to care about cryptospace. STO being some sort of financial "well viewed" solution by lawyers because they contributed to it

[22-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
to me we re just in the middle of a spiral, we re still close to the center but considering a year like a full turn you can see what spreading could mean after just a few years
