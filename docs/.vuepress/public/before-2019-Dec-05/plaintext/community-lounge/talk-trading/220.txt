I think he will accumulate this week.

[17-Oct-18 07:18 AM] dokrates#8987
anyways sell now is dumb

[17-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Maybe starts driving price up for a weekend.

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jorian#4555
a push to $2 would be nice

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jorian#4555
but this whale wouldn't do that

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] dokrates#8987
why?

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] jorian#4555
why buy at 2 when you can buy at 1.20?

[17-Oct-18 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Why push it to $2 .. if you can buy 20% or more of the supply at $1..... then pump it to $100

[17-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jorian#4555
yes. question is when he deems it worthy to pamp

[17-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Mark81#4505
Once btc shows strenght.

[17-Oct-18 07:21 AM] jorian#4555
did fakeout happen yet?

[17-Oct-18 07:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe this whale doesnt want his btc any more :trollface:

[17-Oct-18 07:22 AM] ph03nix#3115
must be genie :trollface:

[17-Oct-18 07:23 AM] dokrates#8987
i see the weekly chart, and it looks pretty beautiful. Macd turned green, volumen increased significantly, also looks like bottom has been reached

[17-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Keytothegate#8453
Yeah from TA perspective it's pretty, hope we can capitalize on bullish momentum

[17-Oct-18 07:24 AM] jorian#4555
i really fear for a fakeout

[17-Oct-18 07:25 AM] jorian#4555
the one spike of volume we had 2 days ago was purely tether panic

[17-Oct-18 07:25 AM] jorian#4555
and that volume wasn't even huge

[17-Oct-18 07:25 AM] jorian#4555
also, on the daily everything is still set for bearish continuation

[17-Oct-18 07:25 AM] jorian#4555
but yeah, TA is useless

[17-Oct-18 07:26 AM] dokrates#8987
past week was 5 milions volume, and this week only wednesday, and we are over 5million volume

[17-Oct-18 07:26 AM] dokrates#8987
wait until sunday, and this week will show big volume

[17-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Mark81#4505
What you think No:1 bitmex on leaderboard by profits (AngeloBTC)  saying that btc had it last drop?

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
WTF

[17-Oct-18 07:28 AM] Keytothegate#8453
Some bullish / interesting news (for the larger public) like 1M tps experimentation would add nicely to this (maybe) starting uptrend

[17-Oct-18 07:30 AM] dokrates#8987
awesome @hyperDEX

[17-Oct-18 07:33 AM] dokrates#8987
whale is back

[17-Oct-18 07:34 AM] dokrates#8987
if you think, it will be pretty smart, put a big wall, and little orders of 3000 4000 5000 above it

[17-Oct-18 07:34 AM] dokrates#8987
usually people doesn't dumps into a buy wall

[17-Oct-18 07:36 AM] Mark81#4505
Fomo will bring public

[17-Oct-18 07:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It seems there is a drawback every time and then a big spike to 19kish again

[17-Oct-18 07:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So I think whale is suppressing price first and have people sell in his buywall then market buy to 19k and remove wall to let people dump again

[17-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Rince and repeat to accumulate between the levels you want

[17-Oct-18 07:38 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, is accumulating nicely

[17-Oct-18 07:38 AM] dokrates#8987
looks like a smart whale, he knows what is doing

[17-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Mark81#4505
Move wall up and build below that nice buy orderbook. Take wall off and let komodo rain to you.

[17-Oct-18 07:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Seems like he may be getting a bit desperate

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes especially now. He is locked.

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We just need him t take it over 20k then all the TA guys will jump in

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] dokrates#8987
i think he may push the price up a little to fill 244btcs XD

[17-Oct-18 07:46 AM] dokrates#8987
21k sat will be nice

[17-Oct-18 07:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
About 30k KMD asks till 20k

[17-Oct-18 07:51 AM] dokrates#8987

Or had enough for competition.

[17-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Mark81#4505
He is in no rush mode.

[17-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Mark81#4505
Dump incoming?

[17-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Mark81#4505
Dumps to himself orders?

[17-Oct-18 08:06 AM] dokrates#8987
dump with no volume

[17-Oct-18 08:07 AM] Mark81#4505
He is so readable.

[17-Oct-18 08:07 AM] dokrates#8987

play money

[17-Oct-18 08:10 AM] dokrates#8987
lovely how he plays with people emotions

[17-Oct-18 08:10 AM] Mark81#4505
So he has at least that amount.

[17-Oct-18 08:11 AM] dokrates#8987
yes, the wall was 1.3M, and in the beginning was 1.9M

[17-Oct-18 08:11 AM] dokrates#8987
so he push price down with all amount he bought past days

[17-Oct-18 08:11 AM] BlockTech#6895
it was 2.5M in the begging i think

[17-Oct-18 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
look at all the lack of liquidity at the buy side

[17-Oct-18 08:12 AM] dokrates#8987
sell wall removed

[17-Oct-18 08:12 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:12 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:13 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
fishermen use part of their last catch as bait ðŸ˜‰

[17-Oct-18 08:16 AM] Mark81#4505
It might be that he sell on his own orders.

[17-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Mark81#4505
He has hardtime accumulating. He needs to play dirty with motions

[17-Oct-18 08:19 AM] dokrates#8987
those who sold below 19.5k are now crying XD

[17-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Take motions off your trading and it will be just numbers.

[17-Oct-18 08:21 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:21 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I missed the action

[17-Oct-18 08:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There was a sell wall to force asks to put it before his big sell order?

[17-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
