the best way to use the cpu

[09-Apr-19 07:27 PM] nocturnal#2177
ill check it out @PHBA2061

[09-Apr-19 07:37 PM] nocturnal#2177
what is all the fuss about vbk?

[09-Apr-19 07:38 PM] nocturnal#2177
is it a komodo asset? or competitor? Or just a coin people here are into?

[09-Apr-19 07:40 PM] crumb#2550
VBK *thinks* they are a competitor. so far the way they do stuff has not been very impressive. and as they are still not fully open source it is very difficult to assess what really happens under the hood

[09-Apr-19 07:41 PM] crumb#2550
right now it appears that they have not thought about all the possible attack/abuse vectors in their approach

[09-Apr-19 07:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
what makes them a competitor? they are dpow too? or what is the comparison?

[09-Apr-19 07:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@nocturnal check out verus ($vrsc) for CPU mining

[09-Apr-19 07:42 PM] nocturnal#2177
thanks hollowman yes i was looking at that

[09-Apr-19 07:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
im not sure how to calculate my hashrate

[09-Apr-19 07:43 PM] crumb#2550
VBC claims they protect chains against 51% attacks, but so far it appears it is merely *detection* of 51% attacks

[09-Apr-19 07:43 PM] nocturnal#2177
does komodo also make that claim?

[09-Apr-19 07:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

KMD *protects* chains who are using dPoW. there have been multiple occasions where people tried to attack it

[09-Apr-19 07:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
with 51% attack?

[09-Apr-19 07:45 PM] crumb#2550
they all failed

[09-Apr-19 07:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
no not possible

[09-Apr-19 07:45 PM] nocturnal#2177
as nobody has 51% so what kind of attacks

[09-Apr-19 07:46 PM] crumb#2550
there have been tries to do a 51% attack and double spend coins protected by Komodo's dPoW

[09-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
On weaker chains it certainly is possible

[09-Apr-19 07:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Without dPoW

[09-Apr-19 07:46 PM] crumb#2550
@nocturnal you might want to read up on stuff

[09-Apr-19 07:47 PM] crumb#2550
understanding tech helps to make better long-term investment decisions

[09-Apr-19 07:47 PM] nocturnal#2177
lol

[09-Apr-19 07:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
a lot of blockchains are vulnerable to 51% attacks, i.e. almost all except the main one using a specific algo. There have been plenty of succesful attacks in the past months. Chains protected by dPoW have been safe

[09-Apr-19 07:47 PM] crumb#2550
and separate whitepaper unicorns and rainbows from reality

[09-Apr-19 07:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
you can fake nodes or some such to pretend having 51% or summat like that

[09-Apr-19 07:48 PM] nocturnal#2177
im more interested in the ideas than the inner workings

what you are saying does not really make sense. how can you judge if ideas are realistic or not, if you don't know how they work

[09-Apr-19 07:49 PM] nocturnal#2177

im interested in the potential for blockchain to re-organise society and power

[09-Apr-19 07:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
and grand nonsense like this

[09-Apr-19 07:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
>I want to make money
Ok, you should probably research what has real substance
>lolz loserz I hab life trololol

[09-Apr-19 07:51 PM] crumb#2550
so any doo-doo that sound awesome, you just think is a great idea?

[09-Apr-19 07:51 PM] nocturnal#2177
hahaha

[09-Apr-19 07:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
in that case

[09-Apr-19 07:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Cz binance is an advisor

[09-Apr-19 07:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
i think the complexity of blockchain tech effectively makes it a centralised system. Just that the centralisation has shifted to a different arena - one based on specific knowledge

[09-Apr-19 07:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
which overall i find preferable to centralisation around banking

[09-Apr-19 07:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
is that with the turtle? üòÇ

[09-Apr-19 07:57 PM] nocturnal#2177
no, no programming

[09-Apr-19 07:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
not since making the turte move on the amiga

*turtle

[09-Apr-19 08:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
i like turtles

[09-Apr-19 08:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
so how does dpow protect against malicious turtle attack?

[09-Apr-19 08:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
or 51% attacks

Delayed Proof of Work Explained
It‚Äôs 2018, and we have recently witnessed many 51% attacks (Double Spending) on various Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains.

[09-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Caglio#3337
I like turtles also

[09-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Caglio#3337
They are lovely creatures

[09-Apr-19 08:05 PM] Caglio#3337
However their poop smells so bad

[09-Apr-19 08:07 PM] nocturnal#2177
delayed proof of turtle is the future

[09-Apr-19 08:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
so like... that article is long... and im tired

[09-Apr-19 08:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
basically dpow uses btc chain somehow as an extra layer of verication

[09-Apr-19 08:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
can it be summed up in a sentence?

[09-Apr-19 08:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
the gist

[09-Apr-19 08:09 PM] nocturnal#2177
was this invented by komodo?

[09-Apr-19 08:10 PM] nocturnal#2177
go turtles

[09-Apr-19 08:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
that cool

[09-Apr-19 08:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
so the 64 notary nodes

[09-Apr-19 08:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
is that basically a centralised system?

[09-Apr-19 08:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats a pushing it alot

[09-Apr-19 08:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
they are operating with the same interests in the same syste,m

[09-Apr-19 08:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
and are open to collaborate

[09-Apr-19 08:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
as much as they want to

[09-Apr-19 08:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
much like international governance for example

[09-Apr-19 08:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
dpow is a system of centralised security

[09-Apr-19 08:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
its not a dirty word

[09-Apr-19 08:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
you can own it

[09-Apr-19 08:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
not centralized, the notaries are elected yearly and are different people. They don't have any power on the consensus of protected chains. It's not dPoS. Every notarization turn is done by a random pick of 13 notaries that must all agree on the same data. Also all normal nodes like you and me, check that the notarized data is correct. Incorrect notarizations would be ignored.

[09-Apr-19 08:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah btc is centralised around mining

[09-Apr-19 08:17 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's a decentrlized method to add checkpoints, on top of existing consensus of blockchains

[09-Apr-19 08:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
decentralisation is only conceptually true of P2P transactions on a system

[09-Apr-19 08:18 PM] nocturnal#2177
behind the scenes crypto is centralised around various pillars

[09-Apr-19 08:18 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats ok

[09-Apr-19 08:18 PM] nocturnal#2177
the p2p decentralisation is still an improvement

[09-Apr-19 08:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
decentralization is a spectrum, dpow is far from the centralized end

[09-Apr-19 08:19 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats a good way to put it

[09-Apr-19 08:19 PM] nocturnal#2177
im using p2p as a shorthand for joe punters sending each other dosh
