Hollowman brings an abacus and a smartphone to parties so he can mine KMD manually and upload his shares to a pool via text message.  All while engaging in social intercourse.

Philosophical question what makes a "good " shitcoin?

[03-Sep-18 03:07 AM] Don King#8901
A good shitcoin has enough supporters to float to the top of CMC along with the cream

[03-Sep-18 03:09 AM] Don King#8901
A rising tide lifts all good shitcoins

[03-Sep-18 03:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
A shitcoin which is good? 
In my opinion a good community,
Constant supporting community of miners,
Buyers and hodlers,
New features built or not doesn't matter, that is why it is shitcoin. Coz it doesn't serve any purpose, other than just fun and learning for newbies.

[03-Sep-18 03:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Doge fits in that description

[03-Sep-18 03:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's a shitcoin. But I guess a good one. 😂

[03-Sep-18 03:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And no I don't hodl doge, before anyone asks. 😅

[03-Sep-18 03:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Same is LTC. I hodl some. It taught me what small miner is and how to use/play/mine with small miner.

[03-Sep-18 03:33 AM] ryman112#0068
A good shit coin requires a catchy name and a promise of solving a problem that is so complicated that teams of folks have been trying to solve for years.  Then you tell the idiocracy about it.  Then you farm them like sheeple and then BAM!  You have a shit coin.   Im taking a shit
So I know about this.

[03-Sep-18 03:35 AM] ryman112#0068
As far as good coins imo are kmd link req and pundix

You get 4 guys to control all perception of what is "good" and you name it "Bitcoin Core"

[03-Sep-18 05:05 AM] snowdamn#2414
ideal plan:

[03-Sep-18 05:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
have KMD scalability test while BTC > $7k and ETH < $300

[03-Sep-18 05:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
KMD justifiably pumps

[03-Sep-18 05:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
then pumps again when the overall pump comes 😉

[03-Sep-18 05:08 AM] snowdamn#2414
"have KMD scalability test" means only if it just so happens to be ready

[03-Sep-18 05:08 AM] snowdamn#2414
not worth the risk rushing it, of course

[03-Sep-18 05:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its darn close to being able to be run. 99% of the stuff is finished.

How much gas would someone hypothetically need to cripple ethereums network? From the cc document I read gas was made to stop people spamming the network. Is this just a deterrent, or does it cost a boatload for someone to cause harm to eth?

[03-Sep-18 08:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
And when is eths scaling solution supposedly completed by?

[03-Sep-18 08:03 AM] jspook16#3059
no idea...300 isnt too crazy....i remember when eth was 3 and slowly crept up to about 300

[03-Sep-18 08:03 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe Kilo Mike Delta can get to 60

[03-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not the spam that is the issue, it is any popular dapp that uses millions of gas. each instruction costs gas, so that is why ETH tx numbers are so high, you run one contract and it counts as many transactions

[03-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
for KMD, a CC transaction is just 1 transaction

[03-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
with 1 txfee, denominated in that chain

[03-Sep-18 08:08 AM] jspook16#3059
crypto kitties..

[03-Sep-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if any single dapp gets mainstream popular, ETH becomes saturated and gas prices go up for everyone

[03-Sep-18 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this is built into the design

[03-Sep-18 08:09 AM] jspook16#3059
i guess when crypto dragons come around kmd wont have that issue

[03-Sep-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst the cryptodragons chain might bog down (if it reaches 5000+ tx/block) but no other chain would be affected

[03-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD design is a dedicated chain for each dapp

[03-Sep-18 08:12 AM] jspook16#3059
is there already a crytpodragon chain? interesting i didnt know that. so each dapp would have its own tokens?

[03-Sep-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
a hypothetical cryptodragon chain

[03-Sep-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
unless the cryptodragon team likes to pay txfees in some other chain, it would seem they would just launch their own dedicated chain. that is why I made it so easy to launch a new chain

[03-Sep-18 08:20 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe I'll claim it first. You have have put together something really impressive

a cryptodragon game would be really awesome

[03-Sep-18 08:30 AM] jorian#4555
who actually played that cryptokitties thing?

[03-Sep-18 08:31 AM] ca333#0118
you d have to call it "Komodoshi", not cryptodragon - there is a full concept out already i wrote many months ago. We even have 2 worlds (= 2 chains) that are connected with the dragon-bridge (=barterDEX). And much more fancy stuff.

[03-Sep-18 08:31 AM] ca333#0118
@jorian some in our team were checking it out. @benohanlon has some kitties

Ethereum Block Reward to Decrease from 3 ETH to 2 ETH | Coincodex
Ethereum Core developers have decided to implement EIP 1234 (Ethereum improvement proposal) in the upcoming Constantinople upgrade. EIP 1234 entails a reduction of the block reward from 3 ETH to 2 ETH, slowing down Ethereum’s inflation rate.
