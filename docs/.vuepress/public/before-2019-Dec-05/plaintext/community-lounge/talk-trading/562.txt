i like the UX of trex waay better

[18-Apr-19 09:26 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Morning peeps, That oracle article ruffled a few feathers eh

[18-Apr-19 09:26 AM] Markus#5464
well bottom was around 19,8k so i call it 20k not 19k

[18-Apr-19 09:27 AM] Markus#5464
so were almost back at that lvl...price now 21.1k

[18-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Buddz1993#5380
BNB and XTZ keep exploding

[18-Apr-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
what feathers were ruffled?

[18-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I can see us doing the same as BNB honestly

[18-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Markus#5464
dont wanna know price of BNB end of next bullrun

[18-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Buddz1993#5380
They have been pumping quite hard on a market like this letâ€™s see what they do in a bull market indeed

[18-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Markus#5464
wouldnt be surprised to see BNB 200-300$

[18-Apr-19 09:33 AM] Markus#5464
looks like we got added on Huobi Korea aswell

[18-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Malti#3948
if you look at BNB chart

[18-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Malti#3948
how it outperformed the bear

when is RedFox Labs going to start operating or did they already begin?

[18-Apr-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
well using the median of submitted prices is clearly flawed. do people need a diagram to understand this?

legal innovation

[18-Apr-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
from the chainlink whitepaper:
"Detecting outlying or incorrect values is a problem that is specific to each type
of data feed and application. For instance, detecting and rejecting outlying answers
before averaging may be necessary for numeric data but not boolean. For this reason,
there will not be a specific aggregating contract, but a configurable contract address
which is specified by the purchaser. ChainLink will include a standard set of aggregating contracts, but customized contracts may also be specified, provided they
conform to the standard calculation interface."

it sure sounds like data aggregation. maybe this can be mitigated to some degree.

[18-Apr-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
also the incentive for miners to mine proper prices is the incentive to mine blocks. all prices are part of the coinbase, without valid prices, no new blockl

I have a math degree, I can spot "fake math" and "lying with statistics" a mile away. @jl777c I am happy to give a math analysis of any algorithm you want me to look at

[18-Apr-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
aggregating a bunch of prices from random sources is as silly as VBK trusting notarizations by random miners

[18-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
my algo doesnt need math to prove itself as it is common sense. all nodes validate all prices, so each node becomes part of the decentralized trustless oracle

[18-Apr-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no master node telling the others what the value is

[18-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no aggregating of trusted sources

[18-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes validate, like decentralization

[18-Apr-19 09:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
aggregating "trusted sources" is open to Sybil attacks, right?

[18-Apr-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if the trust is based on reputation, then you are limited by the value of the reputation. nothing prevents them from lying other than the loss of reputation

[18-Apr-19 09:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am unclear on how everybody defines trusted/trustless, I read the convo for days with Zack/jl777+others, but it was a lot

[18-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if you trust the source, then sybil attacks are not possible without infiltration, but it becomes a trusted oracle

[18-Apr-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if you rely on a node to be honest, you are trusting that node

[18-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if every node validates, it is trustless

[18-Apr-19 09:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like Twitter is just arguing over the definition of words again, which LAWYERS love, it's what they are paid to do. Their existence is governed by them getting judges to agree to their definitions of words

[18-Apr-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
since it doesnt matter what any other node says, if the data is invalid, each node will see that for itself

[18-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it is possible to mitigate the problems caused by data aggregation, by stake weighting, reputation, feedback, secondary reward coin, etc.

[18-Apr-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but that requires a very complex structure and can you really be sure it is really immune from attacks?

[18-Apr-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i did the trustless oracle in a week, a few bug fixes over the next few weeks, it is very small amount of code. cant be too complex

[18-Apr-19 09:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
:troll_king:

[18-Apr-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
does chainlink say that there is no exploit possible? I think the data can be messed with, but then it can be detected and the culprits punished. while this is good for the long term, it does mean that invalid data can be oraclized

[18-Apr-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a bad data detection system? but who detects the bad data if the bad data got oraclized? how it is undone and fixed? is the blockchain rolled back?

[18-Apr-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
in a complex system, all sorts of complex things can happen, especially at the edge cases

[18-Apr-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i do agree that chainlink has some clever things to prevent leeching (where one node copies another nodes data, so doesnt do much work), but that isnt the main problem

before averaging may be necessary for numeric data but not boolean. For this reason,
there will not be a specific aggregating contract, but a configurable contract address

[18-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to say we will have standard aggregating contracts, but if that is a problem you can make a custom one.

[18-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so how to detect the falsified data?

[18-Apr-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what if the data is just biased by 3%, do people lose reputation over that?

[18-Apr-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the lawyer guy seems a bit misguided: "The truth is a schelling point, i.e., everyone tends to converge on this number."

[18-Apr-19 09:58 AM] dukeleto#7326

[18-Apr-19 09:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
seems like they say "we will just fudge stuff if it doesn't work"

[18-Apr-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
when I read that paragraph, i sort of lost interest in chainlink. and maybe didnt read into how amazingly they prevented freeloading with fancy math

[18-Apr-19 09:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, "lawyer guy", I don't think he understands anything he is speaking about, but is super interested in using smart contracts in his law firm

[18-Apr-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the fundamental problem of an oracle is "Detecting outlying or incorrect values"

[18-Apr-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and here it sure sounds like they are aggregating data, onchain or offchain, with a standard contract of a custom one that magically aggregates and knows which data is the attackers data

[18-Apr-19 10:00 AM] Malti#3948
everytime someone says :"I'm not saying this as a xyz fanboy" then you can be sure that he/she is an xyz fanboy and is saying this as an xyz fanboy

I admit I am no expert on oracles, I am just a simple C programmer. and I can usually tell when a problem is unsolved and being punted to some future solution
