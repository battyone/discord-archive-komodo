If you're up 2% then sell. Because you will live another day with profits.

[11-Oct-19 11:39 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Someday KMD will do a 5-10x sprint like LINK or RAVEN did some time ago, i just know it. And even then i am not selling, mainly b/c i lost my google verificator for all my CEX accounts üòÑ

Lots of ads lately of amfeix first blockchain fund....üòñ 
I guess they did not know about supernet  and mshark when they did that ad

[11-Oct-19 12:15 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Amfeix is a fund with a basket of crypto's with them skimming off 20% of the profits? Why would you not just get a range of coins yourself instead?

[11-Oct-19 12:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
in theory because there is a fund manager behind it who has all the trading skills and believes in TA. Not sure what convential (Hedge)Funds charge you maybe 1-2% but on the investment?

[11-Oct-19 12:23 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I pay 0,35% but thats calculated over the assetsvalue invested. Luring ppl in that think "if i lose at least i don't pay fee" is a clear red flag for me. Besides that, crypto is not mature enough for me to invest a serious % of my liquid assets and i think that goes for almost all of the ppl they are targeting with this easy-entry-into-crypto-product. If you really think that you can work miracles you would ask for a flat fee, even when you have a loss year (b/c you have put the same amount of effort into it, maybe even more trying to get into the black). So fee only on profits screams scam to me. TLDR: Scam.

[11-Oct-19 12:25 PM] CoinKing88#1540
A fund like this will get ppl rekt that can't miss the money they invested

[11-Oct-19 12:28 PM] CHMEX#0686

i dont get why komodo is worth less than doge

[11-Oct-19 03:02 PM] Neko#5830
why

[11-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
the question I ask myself everyday

[11-Oct-19 03:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The main reason is, people are stupid.

[11-Oct-19 03:17 PM] Neko#5830
so true

[11-Oct-19 03:36 PM] allbits#5898
Look at coinmarketcap and see how many markets there are for doge and how many for kmd. It's 312 vs 24

Then consider that, at the present time, the by far predominant use cases for crypto are permissionless store of value, speculation, and transferring value to and from and between centralized exchanges. Doge has a far, far bigger network as far as that's concerned and so, while these remain the predominant use cases, how is it surprising that doge and ltc etc have higher market caps? Blaming it on others stupidity is not correct in my opinion.

[11-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Neko#5830
most of the volume is fake

[11-Oct-19 03:46 PM] allbits#5898
Bizarre response since I didn't mention volume. I suspect you're being willfully blind to a plain reality.

[11-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Neko#5830
nothing time wont fix

[11-Oct-19 03:55 PM] allbits#5898
I agree that Komodo is actively pushing towards other use cases that would change this market dynamic.
