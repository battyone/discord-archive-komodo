Never mind the free marketing via Pirate and soon k64 success

[26-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Markus#5464
from where did the 70m ‚Ç¨  investment into K64 come from? RFox?

[26-Jun-19 02:27 PM] longdo#9167
Wake up Kmd, go to Neo, Qtum,...

[26-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Alecandro#1179
@Markus they will be announcing all that any day now. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs from RFOX though

[26-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
Okay

[26-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Alecandro#1179
But I‚Äôm just guessing

[26-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
RFox doesn‚Äôt have ‚Ç¨78M to play with

[26-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs definitely a big company with big time fuck-around cash

[26-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Markus#5464

Did you know @KomodoPlatform is actually an advanced technology partner? (highest partnership with @amazon) 
Did you know that using the soon to be launched #Chainlizard you can launch an independent #AntaraSmartChain that is AWS hosted with a few clicks? $KMD

Instead of making an announcement of the announcement announcing this, @KomodoPlatform is just focused on making it happen and driving adoption which in the end will drive the entire crypto ecosystem. $KMD

this isnt institutional buying here...hedge funds typically dont chase price this aggressively. looks like panic retail buying afraid of missing the run or some dumb government money (no joke) paying any prices

isnt Russian government even mining bitcoin? read it during 2018 maybe fake idk

[26-Jun-19 02:59 PM] c2k#4915
exactlly,,,any unstable country. they can print all the money they want but that causes inflation which has dire consequences. accumulating BTC allows them to spend money on "currency" without affecting their own economies
