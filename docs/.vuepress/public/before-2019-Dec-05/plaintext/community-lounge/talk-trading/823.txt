i like that answer

[22-Jun-19 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but generally speaking paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to get fake trading volumes, it is just nonsense, though you can pretend 20% of your marketcap is trading every day

[22-Jun-19 06:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[22-Jun-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810

No

[22-Jun-19 06:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
bottom of KMD ?

[22-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Markus#5464
Would it be possible to create a trading bot algo to force up price without buying it urself?

[22-Jun-19 06:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I believe so

[22-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Keppie#5156

[22-Jun-19 08:50 PM] Markus#5464

[22-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Mark81#4505
Why count on whalebro?   Beatles said it best: Let it be.

[22-Jun-19 08:52 PM] Mark81#4505
Komodo will do it thing.

[22-Jun-19 08:59 PM] Mark81#4505
I have seen how these cycles play out and wouldn't want to take any other route to get in goal. It's part of these markets. Just ride and joy!

[22-Jun-19 09:03 PM] Markus#5464
holy shit

[22-Jun-19 09:04 PM] Markus#5464
scroll down check money flow in the last 24h

[22-Jun-19 09:05 PM] allbits#5898
@Markus you often talk about tether printing. Are you saying you have information that they just issue tokens without any backing?

[22-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Markus#5464
i dont have information but im sure they do

[22-Jun-19 09:06 PM] allbits#5898
Ahahaha

[22-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Markus#5464
but there was a post not long time ago that was stating that it was only 75% backed

[22-Jun-19 09:06 PM] p.#1126
75% researched :3040_suspepe:

[22-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Markus#5464
so how come they keep printing

[22-Jun-19 09:06 PM] Markus#5464
where does that money come from

[22-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Markus#5464
around 2 bil printed in 6 months

[22-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Markus#5464
thats quite alot

[22-Jun-19 09:07 PM] allbits#5898
No it isn't

[22-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Markus#5464
Alright let me create a stable coin, supply will be 10 bil but its backed by nothing

[22-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Markus#5464
same shit

[22-Jun-19 09:08 PM] allbits#5898
Totally different. You're a nobody

[22-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Markus#5464
and tether is not backed fully

[22-Jun-19 09:08 PM] allbits#5898
You just make stuff up and state it as fact

[22-Jun-19 09:09 PM] allbits#5898
You can look at the NYAG correspondence and it strongly implies full backing

[22-Jun-19 09:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It was like 80ish percent backed

[22-Jun-19 09:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Still better than a bank

[22-Jun-19 09:11 PM] allbits#5898
Then they shifted money "temporarily", backed it 25% by paper, and then, under strong pressure, did a private placement to be replace the paper. That's the information that's out there but for shine reason you think your feelings are a higher authority

[22-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Markus#5464
on the website from tether

[22-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Markus#5464
it says its backed by 2,545 bil

[22-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Markus#5464
why is market cap then 3,532 bil

Guy links a document clearly stating that balances were shown as of June 1, 2018. Jeez. I won't waste time discussing this with you. Your feelings are a higher authority so basis for rational discussion. You'll keep believing in the "tether printer theory" like so many do.

[22-Jun-19 09:17 PM] allbits#5898
I'm not adding it's not a scam. I'm saying there's no evidence to support that statement

[22-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think tether is 90% legit

[22-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Have some problems with confiscated funds

[22-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362

cya dude

[22-Jun-19 09:18 PM] allbits#5898
The document says June 1, 2018. Are you being deliberately silly?

[22-Jun-19 09:19 PM] allbits#5898
That was your "evidence"

[22-Jun-19 09:20 PM] Markus#5464
i understand that aswell but in my opinion if they want to be transparent and get ppls trust like they try to do then why not atleast update "proof of funds"

Tether Attorney Confirms not 100% of USDT is Backed by Fiat
The biggest stablecoin is the world, Tether has been under fire from critics recently following the Bitfinex scandal which revealed that the exchange lost $850 million and masked the whole sum with Tether.

[22-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Markus#5464

[22-Jun-19 09:21 PM] Markus#5464
they even admit its not fully backed

[22-Jun-19 09:22 PM] allbits#5898
That document strongky implies it's fully backed. Read every I said upthread. You're not very good at this are you?

[22-Jun-19 09:22 PM] allbits#5898
You were bragging about your research skills earlier

[22-Jun-19 09:22 PM] Markus#5464
