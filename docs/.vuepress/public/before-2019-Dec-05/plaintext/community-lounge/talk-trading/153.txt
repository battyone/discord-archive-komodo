[12-Sep-18 11:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ETH does seem like it can capitulate more, but still, the bounce off this might be explosive

[12-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Markus#5464
If he is not stupid then probably already done so

[13-Sep-18 12:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
he is not stupid , that I can confirm. Here is his address https://etherscan.io/address/0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b

[13-Sep-18 12:07 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
How can you call somebody who build ETH stupid?! LOL

[13-Sep-18 12:08 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
you must be smarter than him then

[13-Sep-18 12:11 AM] Markus#5464
Well we all have different mindset, different goals and being smart can mean alot of different things, he might be a smart programmer but financially the opposite. Just a small example doesnt have to be that way. My words were more meant towards that if he cared or would of bothered he would of sold and seen the huge dump coming and take advantage of it to accumulate more eth then he already had

[13-Sep-18 12:14 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I just think that judging him stupid is very harsh üòÑ I will never use the word stupid to refer to anybody. But that's me. Cheers

Still rolled back the blockchain üòõ

[13-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, questionable decision LOL

[13-Sep-18 12:23 AM] bishop#9773
I just think a blockchain should be immutable so ETH is a nonstarter and I would rather support ETC... if things can be rolled back, just run a centralized DB

[13-Sep-18 01:34 AM] meatspoon#7860
I hear what you are saying, bishop, but this entire sector is brand new.  Projects are still just learning how to walk so a few stumbles will occur and the community will help with critical feedback.  Mistakes will be made and lessons learned.

[13-Sep-18 01:41 AM] bishop#9773
Absolutely @meatspoon but part of that is realizing that once a mistake is made, you move forward. Just resetting things because you fucked up (or someone fucked up) isn't acceptable when you pitch a technology as forward-focused and not being able to be changed historically. Rolling back the blockchain changes history.

[13-Sep-18 01:43 AM] bishop#9773
No programmer is infallible when it comes to code, but when they make a mistake, they learn from it. Hopefully it isn't detrimental in the process but you learn nonetheless.

[13-Sep-18 02:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Everyone is stupid in one way or the other.  However there are logical thinkers and emotional thinkers.  Who are you?  I am logical hence my many battles in relationships with women.  Not to underrate but thats how it has been
This market is a bunch of emotionally pegged people and they will lose every time period.  You invest and wait.  Period

Centralized exchanges will be a thing of the past within five years. They will be replaced by distributed networks of nodes that facilitate trustless atomic swaps between different cryptocurrencies. Fiat will enter these networks through USD backed stablecoins.

Monaize will be happy

[13-Sep-18 08:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
definitely good news for monaize. If the credit card companies stop being protectionist luddites we could hopefully see a breakout

[13-Sep-18 09:36 AM] sœÜldat#8733
it's a good thing to hide an evil. French banks are increasingly blocking deposits and withdrawals for crypto exchanges (kraken, coinhouse, coinbase..) and closing accounts

[13-Sep-18 09:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
That's banks everywhere. wells fargo is still giving me shit on my coinbase acct here in the states. They're afraid. and they should be.

[13-Sep-18 11:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@actionslacks BB&T never gave me any problems

What‚Äôs the crowd think? @barterdexr just seems like a knock-off

[13-Sep-18 01:11 PM] LocoMB#8593
remembering the viciousness IOTA was fought with- now all the FUDDERS and trolls have passed away...
what is BarterdexR?

[13-Sep-18 01:11 PM] LocoMB#8593
some knockoff like Blocknet?

[13-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or an attempted scam account of the Barterdex twitter account

[13-Sep-18 01:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bdexrekt seems like a blocknet knockoff?

[13-Sep-18 01:12 PM] LocoMB#8593
no, like Blocknet is a Supernet knockoff
