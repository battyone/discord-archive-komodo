Dont worry guess it will be fine

[26-Oct-19 12:23 PM] Markus#5464
at this point i would not be surprised to see kmd below 1k tbh, sad but ye just gonna buy more ðŸ˜„

[26-Oct-19 12:34 PM] Lennart#9331
BTC did retest the descending line from our descending triangle and is now trying to push the next leg up IMHO

[26-Oct-19 12:35 PM] Lennart#9331
next target 11,3K I believe..

[26-Oct-19 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Alts are permanently fucked imo

jl777c always seems to chat  alot when the market is falling

[26-Oct-19 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He always chats a lot

[26-Oct-19 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Just not always in trading ðŸ™‚

[26-Oct-19 02:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Andersen I often look at the diagonal between early 2019 local lows

[26-Oct-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you expand you can see that today/yesterdayâ€™s bounce was on that diag

7300-7400   it's  a bottom  ?

[26-Oct-19 02:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No, i charted a diagonal trend between feb-april lows and thatâ€™s where 7300 touched the diag yesterday for a bounce

[26-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Markus#5464
I think this pump was a fakeout, looking at today daily it does not look good

[26-Oct-19 02:36 PM] Markus#5464
that massive wick is questionable

[26-Oct-19 02:37 PM] Markus#5464
1300$ wick

[26-Oct-19 02:38 PM] Markus#5464
might be a good shorting opportunity

[26-Oct-19 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, i still wouldnt touch that

[26-Oct-19 02:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Weekly looks lit ðŸ˜ƒ

@willofleo nothing wrong with boosting morale

[26-Oct-19 03:43 PM] richardt#2807
TA means nothing when the president of a particular large country announces he supports blockchain tech ðŸ˜„

[26-Oct-19 03:49 PM] richardt#2807
Unfortunately, this may indicate that the next major bull run could be catalyzed by politics/politicians rather than actual tech

[26-Oct-19 03:50 PM] richardt#2807
If true, KMD will be left behind yet again

[26-Oct-19 04:00 PM] Neko#5830
kmd has many different use cases that btc cannot offer, blockchain industry is not just speculation

[26-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Neko#5830
but until the market speak you are technically right

[26-Oct-19 04:01 PM] Neko#5830
the market for kmd

[26-Oct-19 05:26 PM] tolken#2655
I agree with what jl is saying, weâ€™re mostly watching bots trade to fiat. More of this behavior this past year than ever. Iâ€™d buy more Kmd right now but tapped out at moment.

[26-Oct-19 05:38 PM] Bitfinger#6245
If news trumps TA then why did code I wrote a year ago start printing the first buy signals since 12k the last couple of days?

@Bitfinger what about KMD

[26-Oct-19 05:44 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Not liking the bear market, been giving a few buy signals since $1.20, so we should get back there... not sure when though

[26-Oct-19 05:50 PM] Bitfinger#6245
We retraced my last sell candle around 70c so I don't think we'll go much lower

Hidden bullish div on RSI too ^^^

[26-Oct-19 05:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Weekly has a pretty big bullish div in MACD

[26-Oct-19 06:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In RSI too

[26-Oct-19 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Should kmd decide to break the chains and pump for once its going to be fast and violent imo

[26-Oct-19 07:26 PM] Markus#5464
Would feel much better if whales decided to push back price to 10k sats atleast and keep it there rather then slowly humiliating us

[26-Oct-19 07:36 PM] Flint#6435
the best strategy now is to buy KMD, averaging weekly in small portions until you get above 0.00011
In January, you will bite your elbows that you did not buy now! My forecast is at least $ 2 until the end of February! Remember my words

that btc daily candle woah ðŸ¤”

[26-Oct-19 07:39 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Was just gonna say that  @Markus its horrific

[26-Oct-19 07:39 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Better do something in the next few hours

[26-Oct-19 07:39 PM] Markus#5464
if it close like this it will probably be one of the biggest upward wicks btc ever had in its history

[26-Oct-19 07:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Bounce off the CME futures daily 200ma will be legendary

[26-Oct-19 07:46 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Lower tf starting to look bullish, should bounce soon imo

Really truly never thought it'd hit 5000s

[26-Oct-19 09:25 PM] bishop#9773
@Flint Friendly 100 KMD wager that says KMD won't be $2 (or more) by March 1st 2020

[26-Oct-19 09:26 PM] bishop#9773
Had to edit the year in there, didn't want to lose on a technicality

[26-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder... if all bots arb on usd price, technically if you marketbuy kmd/usd on bittrex for example, because it would take a while for bots to react, wouldnt the weighted cmc price would be skewed upwards too much

[26-Oct-19 09:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which would cause binance bots to go crazy for example?

[26-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
On the kmd/btc pair

[26-Oct-19 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I really hate bittrex, but its something Iâ€™m gonna try and find out after my holiday ðŸ˜ƒ

[26-Oct-19 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Have higher sell orders on kmd/btc on bittrex, pump kmd/usd on thin orderbooks on bittrex, have bots take out your sells and then dump price again on kmd/usd to fill your low kmd/btc orders

[26-Oct-19 09:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wonder how the bots would react

[26-Oct-19 09:37 PM] jspook16#3059
@bishop the would the wager be in a CC? that paid out if it hit $2 before March 1st 2020 :troll_hardcore:

[26-Oct-19 10:42 PM] Neko#5830
ha people wagering means it will reach $2 before

[26-Oct-19 10:42 PM] Neko#5830
before some were saying the coin was dead

[26-Oct-19 10:42 PM] Neko#5830
this is bullish talk

[26-Oct-19 11:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Anyone who spends more than 5 seconds at komodo can see itâ€™s not dead

[26-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@bishop  youâ€™re on

[26-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
100 KMD

[26-Oct-19 11:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We need some kind of remind bot

[26-Oct-19 11:23 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Whoâ€™s betting against or for?

[26-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Iâ€™ll join in on the kmd > $2 train

[26-Oct-19 11:24 PM] KTnoc#4131
bet on sats would be more appropriated ðŸ˜‰

[26-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iâ€™ll make it 777 KMD if youâ€™re feeling froggy

[26-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck sats

[26-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dollar fiat was the wager

[26-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Dollar fiat it is

[26-Oct-19 11:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
100 accepted, 777 if you wanna play (optional, 100 already set in stone)

[26-Oct-19 11:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@bishop

[26-Oct-19 11:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

kmd by march 2020 >= 2$

[27-Oct-19 12:27 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I dont see why it can't happen.

[27-Oct-19 12:39 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Is there a betting tool that is able to allow the individual losing to end the bet, at a premium, if the other party approves?

It would take the amount of days passed, and the probability of winning into consideration, and this would all use kmd

[27-Oct-19 01:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Looks like that

[27-Oct-19 01:39 AM] Privatoshi#9487
It started using just 3 markets..
But it outlasted Veil, the Eth Prediction Market,  they closed their doors in June, I think

[27-Oct-19 01:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Millions in funding and they failed to get going

[27-Oct-19 01:40 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Due to difficulties with running ```decentralized``` markets

[27-Oct-19 01:42 AM] Privatoshi#9487
I don't see any cc-predictions
