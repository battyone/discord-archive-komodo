that makes it better for the rest of us

[08-May-19 03:02 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
but how does it really help the individual in questions

[08-May-19 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what individual? I guess I missed a conversation somewhere 🤷🏽

[08-May-19 03:04 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
the "those people" you referenced in your previous comment

[08-May-19 03:04 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they unwittingly help the rest of us, but how does it help them in the first place to invest in ARRR over KMD, assuming they only care about profits

[08-May-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the question is which is likely to have a higher ROI

[08-May-19 03:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
assuming "only care about profits", ARRR is (in theory) more possible to hit 4k sats than KMD is to hit 56k sats

[08-May-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is the most private coin with $5 mil marketcap vs XMR over a billion

[08-May-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is $125 mil marketcap and we like to think undervalued.

[08-May-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
which is more undervalued is what the real question comes down to. there is no price peg between ARRR and KMD

[08-May-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
though ARRR price has pretty closely tracked fiat mining costs

[08-May-19 03:07 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
ah

[08-May-19 03:07 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i got it

[08-May-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE can go up 100x, that is not so crazy

[08-May-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then again so could KMD...

[08-May-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
other than the earliest days, PIRATE trading at 0.03 KMD or above for the most part

[08-May-19 03:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
pirate at 5x DP ARRR/KMD would just about come even with ath, iirc
and a climb from there would be more market likely than a climb from KMD 5x (absent a full bull run, imo)

[08-May-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
adjust for fiat prices when KMD was at 50 cents

[08-May-19 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in fiat prices, it is much closer

@FlyingDutchman to make it even more difficult, I like Chips ods , betting is the mass adoption catalist of crypto I think so you need to spread your love ;0)

[08-May-19 04:31 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
whats the progress looking like on the CHIPS GUI

[08-May-19 04:32 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and for that matter, what's the progress on the Komodo Redesign, the BarterDEX new GUI and full implementation, and the blockchain-as-a-service product

[08-May-19 04:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
looking very good

[08-May-19 04:39 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
when is it expected to launch?

[08-May-19 04:39 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
I assume the price of CHIPS will increase substantially at that point

[08-May-19 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure of any launch dates, we still need a dedicated gui dev to complete the gui for production

[08-May-19 04:43 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
If i wanted to purchase CHIPS, where would I do that

[08-May-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
coinexchange.io has the best liquidity

[08-May-19 04:50 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
wait, so if CHIPS becomes mainstream and has a price explosion, this does not necessarily mean that KMD prices will increase with it?

[08-May-19 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
are you asking if the market will act rationally?

[08-May-19 04:54 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
im asking if usage of separate tokens/services that were built on the Komodo platform, such as pirate or chips, will boost KMD prices

[08-May-19 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
though the CHIPS will lead to KMD and once people actually take a look at KMD, they tend to stick around

[08-May-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if somebody that ignored KMD in the past pays attention after CHIPS, then it would seem that it would help. it is the sticky content concept

[08-May-19 04:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
okay

[08-May-19 04:55 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
but there is no direct tie between the price of KMD and a coin on the ecosystem

[08-May-19 05:05 PM] cascrypto#8206
yes, no direct tie!  but if the kmd eccosystem grows the it has a positive effect

[08-May-19 05:05 PM] cascrypto#8206
more volatility

[08-May-19 05:05 PM] Malti#3948
the binance hack and 'reset' of the chain was actually a nice gateway to start talking about dPoW today to some people at work.

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] Malti#3948
and since I work closely together with IntellectEU it was a nice audience to talk about the qualities of KMD

[08-May-19 05:07 PM] actionslacks#4072
so people were advocating for rollong back blockchains for binance's incompetence?

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think some underestimate the impact CHIPS will have on the value of KMD. I see CHIPS as a way to show to retail investors and consumers that the tech created by the devs of KMD actually works and not just fancy words.

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Malti#3948
the twitter thread that tracked down all transactions said all those btc would be unspendable

[08-May-19 05:09 PM] Malti#3948
but idk what that means tbh

[08-May-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810

On weekends, I met with representatives of several startups to discuss scalability, sharding. But stormy discussion was caused by the KMD system multiple clusters of chains (assets). Future is mass adoption and simplification. That what we do at IBM. And that what doing Ko...

@Kitchen Table

[08-May-19 05:12 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm not arguing that tech doesn't work, I know that it does. I see CHIPS as a way for normal users to use something on a blockchain and actually see it.

[08-May-19 05:12 PM] Malti#3948
the only way to mass adoption is letting people use blockchain without knowing it tbh

[08-May-19 05:13 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It's obvious what I'm trying to convey is being lost. So I'll end with CHIPS is good for KMD>

[08-May-19 05:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
So are the stolen btc spendable or not?

It is very strange to me that someone would have the intelligence, resources, savvy & access to hack major 'whales' on Binance's platform via API, yet be so incompetent as to drown $40 million in addresses where the funds can't be spent.

here it's something about unable to be spent, but don't ask me what he/she means with it

yeah volume gets real when you start selling real btc and not just wash trading on exchange db's

@Malti bull is in weekly 8/41 emas are crossing now. Price pushed forward after break above 41ema. Also bad news are not bad for price anymore

[08-May-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty cool thing about Graviex is they understand DPoW, so they are using a 5 confirmation limit

[08-May-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
which means it will be very fast to move HUSH in and out of Graviex. Txbit currently uses 25confs

[08-May-19 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
amazing to talk with an exchange that seems to grasp DPoW, and benefits from dpowconfs

Fellow Binancians,

Due to irregular trading on some APIs, Binance will restrict all currently existing API keys to have trading functionality only. These keys will then be removed in full at 2019/05/08 4:30 AM (UTC). ```
`Due to irregular trading on some APIs`? Really? That's what they're going with?
