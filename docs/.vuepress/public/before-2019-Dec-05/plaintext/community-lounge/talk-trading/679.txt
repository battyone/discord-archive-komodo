[24-May-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810

`Liquidated long on kmdusdt, sell 20,000,000` Its pretty sad that KMD doesnt have any usd coin pair on any bigger exchange

[24-May-19 06:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You know what was a joke right?

[24-May-19 06:46 PM] Markus#5464
Thats why i said so, cause i wish there was

Wonder if margin trading will be available for every listed coin on binance

[24-May-19 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
that would be sick

[24-May-19 06:48 PM] Markus#5464
probably not 😄 imagine low liquidity coins, make 100x long and throw 1 btc market buy and u make tons of gains haha

[24-May-19 06:49 PM] Alexfrog#1338
more like you throw 1 btc market buy, and then the buy support is too far down and you get instantly liquidated lol

I called out that crypto cowboy guy on this discord a few days ago. Says he wants "marketing". What he means is he wants the team to blow scarce resources on fluff in order to generate a short term pump to cover his speculative losses. Now he says that refusal to do that is "dumb". I happen to think it's responsible stewardship and the mark of a project that is smart and forward looking. Resources are spent on real development, infrastructure, supporting ecosystem projects and, when the time is right, marketing geared to actual end users. I'm long and strong, based on the best ideas development in the space, and a wonderful and growing community of development talent.

In reference to CowboyCrypto; he's just frustrated. It's been a long difficult bear market for many.

[24-May-19 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Looking for reasons to blame I guess

[24-May-19 09:17 PM] Vertigo#0439
I put a sell of all my KMD 1 to 1  BTC.

[24-May-19 09:20 PM] phm87#7395
if 1 BTC = 1 KMD, I don't know if it still makes sense to notarize KMD on BTC

[24-May-19 09:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
if BTC is still the chain with the most hash yes

[24-May-19 09:22 PM] SHossain#0007
price has nothing to do with hash

Bitcoin Cash Miners Undo Attacker's Transactions With '51% Attack'...
Two mining pools recently carried out a 51 percent attack on the bitcoin cash blockchain.

lulz

[24-May-19 09:24 PM] phm87#7395
sorry I mean if hashrate of KMD is above BTC's one but not sure how to compare (maybe cost per hour ... or per block)

Lol ok

[24-May-19 09:26 PM] Buddz1993#5380
easily done

[24-May-19 09:26 PM] phm87#7395
@Buddz1993  BCH is not the top coin on its hashing algo so other pools can attack it (in theory)

[24-May-19 09:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Someone offer them DPoW

[24-May-19 09:26 PM] Buddz1993#5380

soon to take over BTC ( price / coin )
never heard of it

[24-May-19 09:27 PM] Buddz1993#5380
@phm87  sure but for many its the  real "BTC" lol

[24-May-19 09:27 PM] phm87#7395
@CHMEX  I know that my question is very theoric for now

[24-May-19 09:28 PM] phm87#7395
ok I can write bitcoin core and bitcoin abc, I don't care about terms or what is real or not real ... 96% of the planet think that all cryptos are not real

[24-May-19 09:28 PM] Buddz1993#5380
a coin with that reputation shouldn't be so vulnerable to attacks,

[24-May-19 09:29 PM] Buddz1993#5380
that only proves that its super overvalued like most top coins , oh well I guess I can talk like that about nearly all coins in the crypto market besides a few..

[24-May-19 09:29 PM] phm87#7395
are you talking about the segwit thing or the 51% ?

[24-May-19 09:30 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well both

[24-May-19 09:30 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think the question is just fine...

[24-May-19 09:30 PM] phm87#7395
well, the weird segwit tx of the "attacker" respected the consensus if I understood correctly so it was not an attack

[24-May-19 09:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380
it was stopped

[24-May-19 09:31 PM] phm87#7395
thanks to a 51%

[24-May-19 09:31 PM] phm87#7395
coordinated by 2 pools

[24-May-19 09:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Exactly

[24-May-19 09:32 PM] phm87#7395
How do you define bad and wrong in the crypto sphere ?

[24-May-19 09:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
loool

[24-May-19 09:32 PM] Buddz1993#5380
my point exactly

[24-May-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
It happens that I joined a discord to disclose a bug to a shitcoin dev, I was banned and my messages deleted. Then I sent a good miner to do the same thing and printscreen it. As coin dev didn't agree that it was a bug, can we define it as a feature ? (as it is inside the consensus rule of wallets at exchanges and so on)

[24-May-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
in few words, they added a "mandatory" dev fee that was mandatory to pay but amount can be chosen by pool ^^

[24-May-19 09:34 PM] phm87#7395
it was fun times

[24-May-19 09:38 PM] richardt#2807
BTC creeping back up again.  Which only means one thing... KMD going down.  😄

@allbits if "that crypto cowboy guy" is who I think it is, he was absent away from home on a job for months and all the ARRR he had was locked when he came home. It wasn't "speculative losses", it was realized losses.

[25-May-19 12:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
There’s a second zc->zs movement next fork, isn’t there?

[25-May-19 12:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not realized losses if so @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[25-May-19 12:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes there is and any trading opportunity losses over the last 2 months are factually realized

[25-May-19 12:50 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

One of my greatest fears for retail investors in crypto is that many are drawn to the next shiny thing & become bored with a simple strategy.

Form a thesis. Build conviction. Stay disciplined.

And remember that sometimes the best investment is not doing anything at all.
