Where does this idea of government pumping doge comes from? It doesnt make any sense.

[09-Sep-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the only semi-rational explanation for DOGE price action?

[09-Sep-18 02:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
When governments are so good at forming peoples opinions, why would they need to actually invest money to make crypto look like "a joke"?

[09-Sep-18 02:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
My rational explanation is that doge got capital from ETH market cap because of the dogetereum thing

[09-Sep-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but who would want to pay ETH txfees for DOGE? that makes even less sense than govt buying DOGE

[09-Sep-18 02:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its just fan boysism

[09-Sep-18 02:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
To imply people actually care about high gas fees, ETH would have never got so high in market cap in the first place

[09-Sep-18 02:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Gov buying doge is just a lazy conspiracy theory

[09-Sep-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but who other than testers would want to deposit DOGE into ETH and use ETH for transactions instead of just using DOGE directly?

[09-Sep-18 03:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I understand that technically it doesnt make much sense. But its just the "partnership", "integration" message what seems to be catchy.

[09-Sep-18 04:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Actually do we know if it goes the other way?

[09-Sep-18 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what other way?

[09-Sep-18 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
like ETH becoming DOGE?

[09-Sep-18 04:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Use eth buy dog Ethereum convert back to doge

[09-Sep-18 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think so... that was what it was supposed to do.

[09-Sep-18 05:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That would explain the sinking ship of Ethereum and doge price rise.  Combined with other factors.   Just the last time I remember doge pumping in a bear market was when cryptsy was going belly up

[09-Sep-18 05:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Conspiracy theory time :  quiet exodus out of eth into doge to prevent bank run on exchanges.

[09-Sep-18 05:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im no fan of conspiracy theories, but i do agree that if something fishy is happening, it must be from ETH

[09-Sep-18 05:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
DOGE is just DOGE

I'm glad we didn't take off with the dICO idea,  that is going to be the death of Eth ,  each well funded ICO is a sword of Damocles over the coin.

[09-Sep-18 05:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If Eth goes then 1000 projects are #rekt

[09-Sep-18 05:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Don't get me wrong having some ICO projects is ok and is necessary to build an ecosystem,  but Eth is *all * projects and projects have expenses.

[09-Sep-18 05:15 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The problem is that ETH never got over ERC20

[09-Sep-18 05:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And can't implement scalability until after Casper which has been delayed at least another year

[09-Sep-18 05:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i was told yesterday that SingularDTV got a cease and desist notification from the SEC

[09-Sep-18 05:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they hold 200k ETH

[09-Sep-18 05:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and they need to give them back to the investors now.

[09-Sep-18 05:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I know it because they had a branch here in Puerto Rico and a friend of mine knew the guy they hired here

[09-Sep-18 05:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They had given the Puerto Rico offices $1m to establish here and now they have to take it back.

[09-Sep-18 05:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont know how many more projects are in the same position as this one.

[09-Sep-18 05:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Might be part of the issue regarding ETH death.

[09-Sep-18 05:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and this whole selloff in general.

[09-Sep-18 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but how could a decentralized project be forced to do anything?

[09-Sep-18 05:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
decentralized? lol Singular DTV seems to have been a corporation established in the USA

[09-Sep-18 05:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
dICO need to raise most funds in BTC or other liquid coins, the tech makes it possible and it's the best idea. KMD will never suffer the same selling pressure as ETH

[09-Sep-18 05:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ICOs did collect BTC too.... i dont think that is something relevant overall

[09-Sep-18 05:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Even if not it probably offered to us citizens which breaks the securities law.  Funny though because it's not illegal to buy an unregistered security and there types of unregistered securities that are legal.

[09-Sep-18 05:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This info came from third persons so im not sure about details.

altough the price that we are sitting at its juicy enough to drop a few more fiat into this..

[09-Sep-18 09:28 PM] jspook16#3059
for long term HODLing maybe get 25% now....save the rest of your fiat for other lower points you think we might reach...

[09-Sep-18 09:29 PM] jspook16#3059

[09-Sep-18 09:30 PM] jspook16#3059

eventually it will be right lol

[10-Sep-18 12:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its kind of hard for it to collapse when its so horribly rigged by central banks inflating all the fiat so heavily the last 10 years but at some point soon they can't/won't keep doing that. From what I know money supply has already slowed significantly this year, so it can't be far away.
