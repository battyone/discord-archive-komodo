no it's a wrong statement altogether

[17-May-19 05:09 PM] jorian#4555
it received 160,000

[17-May-19 05:10 PM] jorian#4555

anyone here have experience or knowledge in making trading indicators? Im trying to make a indicator for tradingview to help maximize profits while swing trading

[17-May-19 06:22 PM] 74D30#6106
TA does not correlate with crypto. Pattern is large cap run, mid cap run, small cap run. But what do I know I'm just a dude

[17-May-19 06:22 PM] Markus#5464
so hodl is the only way?

[17-May-19 06:23 PM] Markus#5464
if so, when u take profits?

[17-May-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
after it goes up the target amount, sell off a percentage

[17-May-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
always recoup capital, before the long hodl

[17-May-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
like sell half after double, the capital comes back, the rest can long hodl

[17-May-19 06:24 PM] Markus#5464
JL u got any ideas what a indicator need to compare to buy as low as possible and sell as high as possible?

[17-May-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[17-May-19 06:25 PM] Markus#5464

[17-May-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
make a set . of moving averages of longer and longer periods

[17-May-19 06:26 PM] jl777c#5810
when the price is above the fastest MA, that MA above the next slower MA, .... all the way to the slowest, SELL

[17-May-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
when the price is below the fastest MA, that MA is below the next slower MA, ... all the way to the slowest, BUY

[17-May-19 06:27 PM] jl777c#5810
this will end up only buying when extremely oversold on all time periods and selling when overbought on all time periods

[17-May-19 06:28 PM] jl777c#5810
depending on the MA periods you choose it might only issue a few trades, but the rarer the trades, the higher chance they will be profitable

most aggressive is to just ping pong from long to short to long based on these triggers

[17-May-19 06:29 PM] Markus#5464
Alright thanks, will work on that and i quess i can make adjustments based on how often u want to get signals

[17-May-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
tune it based on backtesting,but dont overtune it

[17-May-19 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
best to backtest against a variety of trading pairs

[17-May-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
use the ones that get the most consistent results, which usually wont be the one with the absolute best as that one likely is just overfitted

[17-May-19 06:32 PM] Markus#5464
Make sense

We must not choose anything other than a maximally decentralized base as the foundational settlement layer of the global economy.

It's been there a while and it's been shrinking. We've had 2 or 4 of these big whales the last two to three weeks and people always sell into it. Whenever I see these walls I always assume two things:
1. They probably know something to buy that large amount
2. They plan on selling at a much higher price than where they're buying.
