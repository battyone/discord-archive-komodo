[02-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It will be worth zero

[02-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And all can have a tiny slice of KMD for free

[02-Aug-18 10:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then it will rocket to infinity

[02-Aug-18 11:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In another chat someone told me something that seems kind of dumb but it relevant

[02-Aug-18 11:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
These are traders/investors

[02-Aug-18 11:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was talking about kmd and new developments.... answers where... "nice but meh"

[02-Aug-18 11:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I asked what was about kmd that dont convinced

[02-Aug-18 11:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Answer was "just another shitcoin"

[02-Aug-18 11:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Seems like there is no message out saying what is innovative about kmd

[02-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
To most fly by night investor, if the coin isn't in the top 20 then it's a shit coin.

[02-Aug-18 11:09 PM] eXpect-Hans#3390
guys why is the price falling like that??

[02-Aug-18 11:18 PM] shrk#2280
