[23-Oct-18 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
DCR is because it's getting listed on binance

[23-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[23-Oct-18 09:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think today might be doom day in stocks

[23-Oct-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been hearing things similar

[23-Oct-18 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
we shall see

[23-Oct-18 09:44 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nikkei just dumped today

[23-Oct-18 09:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[23-Oct-18 09:45 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
eh lul nasdaq rejected at 200 day lmfo

[23-Oct-18 09:46 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
russels is already below previous low and way below 200

[23-Oct-18 09:46 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
snp below 200

[23-Oct-18 09:47 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
well, if they do indeed all close below 200, then even the bots start panic selling i guess ^^

[23-Oct-18 09:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lets see how it goes

[23-Oct-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is BTC a safehaven ?

[23-Oct-18 09:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I like that btc doesnt have anymore sellers heheh

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats all we care about right?

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Until it becomes a safehaven it isnt

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For now, we are just ahead in the bear market heheh

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
agreed ... not holding any myself ... I piled nearly all my money into paying off debt

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the stablest of coins at 6400

[23-Oct-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
figured that was safest play

[23-Oct-18 09:49 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
there are arguments for and against it,  general FUD in all markets can also catch on to btc

[23-Oct-18 09:49 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i personally think btc is a hedge, while it will drop probably due to first move along, it will rebound

[23-Oct-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when stocks dived few weeks (?) back BTC aslo fell , but far less.

[23-Oct-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a lot of people think that way, but unless whales also do, it will fall with everything else.

[23-Oct-18 09:53 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
there is also a base to btc itself, the break even,

[23-Oct-18 09:54 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
watched a recent interesting interview with tom lee from fundstrat

[23-Oct-18 09:54 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
he mentioned that stocks are traded 240:1 speculatively while btc is only on a 4:1 ratio

[23-Oct-18 09:54 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
he sets the break even at 6k, which he thinks is while we are also holding on this level

[23-Oct-18 09:54 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
end of year should be about 8-9k break even

[23-Oct-18 09:55 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
btc has almost never traded below the break even

[23-Oct-18 09:56 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
when looking at the feb/march  stocki market corrections, they also had impact on btc price, since it was above the BE

[23-Oct-18 09:56 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
also a few weeks ago it was just correction, markets didn't go below 200daily, this time it's different

[23-Oct-18 09:57 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
with a real crash ppl will start to look for alternatives

[23-Oct-18 09:57 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
instead of stocks it's gonna be gold/silver

[23-Oct-18 09:57 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
and hopefully digital gold aka btc

[23-Oct-18 10:00 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
so a conspiracy scenario for me is: financial markets crash, institutions dump btc to get more short liquidity, dump to ~3k, some scared bottom sellers, institutions buy up all the coins, price rebounds to 8k and goes up

[23-Oct-18 10:01 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
but more likely is, not a big reaction and 4th quarter strength up in general along the BE

[23-Oct-18 10:01 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
then some small correction in january

[23-Oct-18 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, with Trump reacting against the FED intrest rate policy, I can see him pressuring them to keep rates low, thus keeping the financial markets pumped artificially

[23-Oct-18 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Last week or even maybe 2 weeks ago he already went on a rant against the fed

[23-Oct-18 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Biggest problem atm is fucking Italy spending too much money

[23-Oct-18 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It will be interesting to see how the ECB will react

btc in general hasn't reset on the monthly yet though IMHO

[23-Oct-18 10:05 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
oh yeah almost forgot: we are also just a week away from a trendline in price that has held since 2011

[23-Oct-18 10:08 AM] ph03nix#3115

BTC traders active in the OTC market know that for all of 2018, large bidders have lived at 6K and under. Lot of fishing/expressions of interest there. Buyers here see that as a backstop. If price rises, patient 6K guys would probably start reaching.

my fear /worst case bearish scenario is, that price does break down below the turqoise line, due to monthly rsi/macd, in 2014 crash we only restarted the bullmarket after the monthy reset

[23-Oct-18 10:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
I should probably re up soon though

[23-Oct-18 11:16 AM] Tek#5253
I seem to notice the more smarter people and devs that actually know stuff are in the BCH camp

[23-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Tek#5253
while all the people that don't even work in IT, like in the multiple facebook crypto groups im in are in the BTC camp

[23-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Tek#5253
@Cryptoon I'm collecting BCH XMR DCR and KMD mainly right now

[23-Oct-18 11:18 AM] Tek#5253
well not collecting DCR anymore but it's part of my main holds

[23-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Im holding small portions of btc and eth for liquidity

[23-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[23-Oct-18 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
yeah uhm instead of throwing brainless memes around you should instead check out whats happening in the BCH camp and what's happening in the BTC camp ( nothing )

[23-Oct-18 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
then decide where you go

[23-Oct-18 11:27 AM] Tek#5253
lighting doesn't work , do you even follow the news?

[23-Oct-18 11:27 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
topkek. comes into kmd discord, implies everyone using btc is dumb and bhc devs/users are much more intelligent, gets a meme reply, gets offended :trollface:

[23-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Tek#5253

[23-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Tek#5253

We have a PoC CC that make LN not required .. BTC was killed by core ...

[23-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its developemnt stopped dead a long time ago

[23-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
However its hash rate means its still the best blockchain

[23-Oct-18 11:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD needs BTC ðŸ˜‰

[23-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Tek#5253
rumour has it that people in the BCH camp found a new algo/miner to mine BTC at much better rates than the competition

[23-Oct-18 11:35 AM] Tek#5253
that they are now driving up the difficulty
