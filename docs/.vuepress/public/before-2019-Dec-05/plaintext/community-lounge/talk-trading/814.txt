Well itâ€™s gym time now to get a clear head for trading time afterwards ðŸ’ª

[22-Jun-19 09:23 AM] Oszy#5734
good call

[22-Jun-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
to predict the KMD low, you need to predict the short term BTC high

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Markus#5464
wow KMD is ultimate rekt

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
deaded

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Tek#5253
10k is the bottom

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i called it

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Tek#5253
jl was joking when he said it but its actually tru

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Tek#5253
^

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
James, the bitmaps/KMD_BTC graph not updating anymore?

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] Markus#5464
if btc will keep going and real fomo euphoria will kick in then kmd can definitely go way lower

[22-Jun-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it stopped updating

[22-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Tek#5253
yes. I also have an order at 7777 sats

[22-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Tek#5253
> not having meme orders

[22-Jun-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
anything is possible

[22-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i remember 2 bears ago, BTCD went below $1, seemed pretty bleak, ie. $1 mil marketcap!

[22-Jun-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
even in the bull market, until the end KMD price wasnt that big

[22-Jun-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
even fiat price was struggling to get past 50 cents, then one day was over $1, then $3, $5 and even up to $15

[22-Jun-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
altseason seems to be just several months long, the rest of the time subject to the BTC whims

[22-Jun-19 09:31 AM] kaks#6612
if btc goes to 20k alt coin suffer more

[22-Jun-19 09:32 AM] Markus#5464
dont know why ppl seem to surprised that btc break all resistances while tether printing non stop pushing price up

[22-Jun-19 09:32 AM] Markus#5464
quess ppl are happy their bags grow but dont look at what really is happening

[22-Jun-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be a good leading indicator

[22-Jun-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
cant you make decent money doing 100x bitmex longs when the printer spews out $100 mil USDT?

[22-Jun-19 09:33 AM] Markus#5464
definitely

[22-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
350+ BTC sell wall

[22-Jun-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
its not the tether its the shorts getting rekt then shorting again getting rekt again

[22-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
being eaten away pretty fast on binance

[22-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
200btc left

[22-Jun-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
this is going to break through 11k

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
100btc

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
yeah...

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
think so too

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
gone

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
12k was the target

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Mische#6695
Wow

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
this morning I got another "go long" signal from the signal grups

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
less than 5 minutes to eat through 350+ BTC sell wall at 10790

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
they are usually correct honestly, atleast the last weeks

[22-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Markus#5464
how is it hard to give signals when it goes parabolic

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Markus#5464
set long and forget it

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
they haven't been wrong on going long for a week now

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
i haven't gotten a "go short" message

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
only a "go long"

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
and "target reached"

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Markus#5464
if u look at the chart its not very strange

[22-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
im in a few signal groups and pump and dump groups for market research

[22-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Tek#5253
( i don't pay any memberships)

[22-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Markus#5464
just keep in mind that parabolic rise usually means 80% correction from where it started

[22-Jun-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just munching through 30btc "walls" like nothing

[22-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Markus#5464
so this could go to 20k easily then crash down to 8k

[22-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
doubt. if the cycles hold true

[22-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
anything below 20k is the new bottom

[22-Jun-19 09:39 AM] Markus#5464
dont forget this is most likely not a bull market but a halvening rally

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Markus#5464
usually happens 1 year pre halvening

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes this isnt really happening

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
I think we r gonna have a super massive run. the greatest of them all

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
the last golden bull run

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all a big bull trap

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i predict 3 more bull/bear cycles

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
following old patterns

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
im thinking 2 more cycles where BTC is dominant

[22-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Markus#5464
well not bull trap but if we check previous halvenings it rally for roughly 12 months then dump hard

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
then it will be big enough to be like stock market

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
im thinking ETH is gonna take over at one point

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
already has more markets than btc

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Markus#5464
That would be silly

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] CoinKing88#1540
eth? eth only went to the moon b/c of all those ERC-20 ICOs imo

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Markus#5464
a non scalable coin to be nr1

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
ETH will scale eventually

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
ive read reports of 600tx/sec

[22-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
already on testnet

[22-Jun-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
100 btc defending 10900

[22-Jun-19 09:42 AM] CoinKing88#1540
BTC going for 11K as we speak now

[22-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Markus#5464
kmd going for 10k :troll_king:

[22-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[22-Jun-19 09:42 AM] kaks#6612
@jl777c so can btc break 20k lvl?

[22-Jun-19 09:43 AM] CoinKing88#1540
BTC ate through 550 BTC sellwall @ 10860 15 minutes ago like it wasnt even there

[22-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
that held for 2 minutes

[22-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this is pretty amazing power

[22-Jun-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
a LOT of money is flowing into BTC

[22-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Markus#5464
it will keep going up as long as there is no whale dumping huge amounts in matter of minutes

[22-Jun-19 09:44 AM] CoinKing88#1540
No smart whale is gonna dump now

[22-Jun-19 09:44 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Just wait, road to 13-15K is like free money now

[22-Jun-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
3000 BTC was dumped the other day, slowed it down for a few hours only

[22-Jun-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, 13k to 15k seems an easy target to hit

[22-Jun-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but 11k bears are defending

[22-Jun-19 09:46 AM] Markus#5464
pretty parabolic

[22-Jun-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the peak of 40k instead of 20k

remember that at the top of this cycle you wont even notice this anymore. it will be a small bump on a flat lnie
