`if only idiots will buy BTC, why do you own BTC?`
Is that rhetorical or do you really not get why I'm fine with selling an antiquated, valueless thing to some moron that thinks it has value?

[17-Sep-18 04:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
earlier you implied that you hold BTC.  you said it is massively overvalued and presumably will die a fiery death soon.   Why would you hold an asset like that?

[17-Sep-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because even if it drops to $920, I still double my investment...

[17-Sep-18 04:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
your language is very judgmental, by the way.  I am sure some people reading your comments are BTC holders, and you are calling them idiots and morons.

[17-Sep-18 04:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
anyone buying this dip, for example, is an idiot in your opinion

[17-Sep-18 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not saying that "holders" are "morons and idiots", I'm saying that "People that believe that BTC, as a part of modern tech, is a *store of value*  that has more value than any random object (or other currency) are morons and idiots"

[17-Sep-18 04:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
But you don't double your investment, Haiduc.  You get rekt.  You are consciously making the decision right now to not sell for 6K.  That is a choice.  If we go to 920, you wont be doubling, you will be losing over 80%

[17-Sep-18 04:43 PM] snowdamn#2414
it's only money lol

[17-Sep-18 04:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
so your inaction, by not selling, indicates you are choosing BTC over 6k in fiat.  By your own logic, your choice to hold BTC is moronic

[17-Sep-18 04:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I paid $460, and anything over $460 is profit and I'm losing nothing other than that which is intangible

[17-Sep-18 04:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
have you ever taken any econ courses?

[17-Sep-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just *a few* 😉

[17-Sep-18 04:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
we need $50k BTC to bring good vibes back

[17-Sep-18 04:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
then you are familiar with opportunity cost.  yet ignoring the concept

[17-Sep-18 04:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you're looking at unrealized gains/losses and pretending that they are realized 😣

[17-Sep-18 04:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
don't forget to price in taxes if you want to be serious about it 😉

[17-Sep-18 04:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
inaction is a choice.  You are essentially choosing BTC over fiat every moment you carry BTC.  But that action is incompatible with your stated view that BTC will go lower and die

[17-Sep-18 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_paid more in taxes because of BTC than he paid for his 1st home 😦_

[17-Sep-18 04:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
yup

[17-Sep-18 04:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon I live in the US with a President that doesn't even understand the basics of how government works and might **still** get reelected, I place an infinitesimal value on fiat atm

good luck man, things are gonna be frustrating as reality continues to not mesh well with your world view.

@snowdamn the answer to the stepped over question is "yes"

`good luck man, things are gonna be frustrating as reality continues to not mesh well with your world view.`
I'm glad that you are special enough to read minds and know what my "world view" is, it saves me about 400 pages of typing 🙂

[17-Sep-18 04:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
When someone just slips anti-trump criticism into a debate about cryptos, uh, yeah that helps bring things into focus.

[17-Sep-18 04:57 PM] dan.#2473
as long as people keep mining the hell out of it it'll have a value

[17-Sep-18 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not "anti-Trump", per se; I'm anti-moron in all situations...

[17-Sep-18 04:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Especially when that person still looks to be wet behind the ears and he is saying a 70 year old billionaire knows nothing about government...

[17-Sep-18 04:58 PM] jorian#4555
i hear Trump? #talk-other-topics  plz :trollface:

[17-Sep-18 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If Trump could scrape together 50 million of his own cash, I'd be impressed; so, let's dispense with the using partnerships and partial ownerships net-worth as something meaningful, OK?

[17-Sep-18 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
You certainly seem to think a lot of people are idiots. Maybe its just that you are so smart, that everyone else is just a mouth-breather in comparison.

[17-Sep-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm a realist; statistically, a lot of people **are** idiots

[17-Sep-18 05:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
Right. Bitcoiners, Trump, people who voted for him, anyone who doesnt see your vision of which cryptos “should” succeed. The list is long so far and we have only been chatting a short time.

[17-Sep-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon You really strike me as the type to wonder why an average child would get all "C's" on their report-card and not all "A's and B's" 😣

[17-Sep-18 05:04 PM] meatspoon#7860
I spend zero time wondering that.

[17-Sep-18 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
You do a lot of bragging, Haiduc. And you spend a lot of time calling people idiots.

[17-Sep-18 05:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
Just an observation

[17-Sep-18 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` And you spend a lot of time calling people idiots.`
My comments reflect my environment?

2+2=4, I'm not going to pretend it's 5 just to make people happy

BTC sux as tech and as a "store of value"

[17-Sep-18 05:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
Haha, suck, huh?  Have you created anything, Haiduc?  Other than that insanely macho thumbnail avatar?

[17-Sep-18 05:08 PM] BlockTech#6895
I agree with you for the math, and BTC tech sux, but the store of value is defined by people and adoption, more than by tech i thing, just my opinion.

Personally, I despise the fact that ETH exists over ETC, but I'm still waiting for a single, rational argument that states why BTC is a more valuable (aka "better") "store of value" than ETH [specifically 30x] or KMD [specifically 6300x]....

[17-Sep-18 05:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  massive amounts of hardware securing it

[17-Sep-18 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is also secured by the same hardware

[17-Sep-18 05:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
@polycryptoblog plus, massive amounts of national currency that has been converted to BTC in the country where the majority of the said hardware is located 😉

[17-Sep-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is a bit like proof of electricity

[17-Sep-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
which is a very real cost even if you cant hold it in your hands (for very long)

[17-Sep-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so it has a relatively high cost basis and someone who went to the trouble to spend $5000 on electricity for a BTC is less likely to sell if for less than $5000 than someone who purchased it at $500

[17-Sep-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is true that the recently mined BTC at $5000 is a small fraction now, so the predominant price setter is the fact that it is trading at whatever price

Little help

[17-Sep-18 05:47 PM] dan.#2473
it might be a 'blessing' that btc is a simple chain, being that if it employed things such as the way eth does smart contracts, it would be more expensive (in fiat) to utilize it's security via OP_RETURN

[17-Sep-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
invrmd160 and invsha256

[17-Sep-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
just do invsha256(invrmd160(base58 address -> rmd160)) and you will get the pubkey, then do a pub2priv on that to get the privkey

[17-Sep-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
alternatively, just scan 2^256 addresses generated from privkeys

@polycryptoblog Do you have stats supporting number of units of hardware or did you just pull that statement out of "the party line"?

[17-Sep-18 06:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
statistically, comparing units is akin to comparing apples to oranges, but I'd be interested to see whatever stats you've amassed and the supporting data

not sure I understand... i thought holochain didnt have a blockchain, but it is using KMD dPoW somehow?

they seem to be able to run apps on it and those can be blockchains and he plans on bilding one with the komodo consences

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢   S9i is 94w/TH  Bitcoin network hashrate: 44.8 exahash = 44.8 million terahash.  Or about 3.1 million machines.  .  With a 4.2 gigawatt power draw Ethereum: Network hashrate: 222 TH  = 222 million megahash is about 1.2 million machines at  .91 gigawatt power draw

[17-Sep-18 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@polycryptoblog so, in other words, you're just making shit up based on some random extrapolation of some random equipment and no factual basis 😣

[17-Sep-18 09:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's taking an estimate,   Based off of the most popular  mining hardware for each of the algorithms and it's power consumption .

[17-Sep-18 09:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The thing is Ethereum is not even close,  so where is your counter argument

[17-Sep-18 09:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and you offer what as evidence that anything more than a fractional amount of BTC hash comes from `S9i` or that it's "the most popular mining hardware"?
