That $kmd rebrand didn't exactly have the same effect as  raiblocks -> $nano or antshares -> $neo did it...The crypto community has become apathetic towards used up FA...Basically partnership with major company or stfu.

:troll_lol:

[21-Jul-19 11:40 PM] Markus#5464
99% of ppl probably dont even know about kmd aws partnership

[21-Jul-19 11:40 PM] Markus#5464
not even this rebrand barely mentioned it

[21-Jul-19 11:41 PM] Markus#5464
its like kmd dont want to spread the word and then its too late

[21-Jul-19 11:42 PM] Markus#5464
would not be surprised to see other projects use kmd tech and market it and then they get the attention and kmd not

[21-Jul-19 11:42 PM] Markus#5464
might even happen

[21-Jul-19 11:43 PM] Caglio#3337
@p.  true.... everyone actually knew this will happen, we just didnt know we will got cumdump logo

[21-Jul-19 11:46 PM] p.#1126
wouldnt be surprised if we have a big green dildo soon

[21-Jul-19 11:46 PM] p.#1126
TBH

[21-Jul-19 11:46 PM] Markus#5464
we are pretty much on the edge to fall down back to 9k

[21-Jul-19 11:47 PM] Markus#5464
so a green candle would be nice for sure

[22-Jul-19 12:08 AM] Caglio#3337
Or we can go back to 5k

[22-Jul-19 12:08 AM] Caglio#3337
and everyone else is gonna buy more

[22-Jul-19 12:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
maybe a red reverse dildo

[22-Jul-19 12:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
inverted dilly

[22-Jul-19 12:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
the average crypto investor cannot be bothered with reality.

[22-Jul-19 01:00 AM] JimD#9272
Gotta get Mcafee in here to hype us up

[22-Jul-19 01:00 AM] Caglio#3337
good idea jimd

[22-Jul-19 01:00 AM] JimD#9272
KMD to 200$ by 2020

[22-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Caglio#3337
but we cannot afford anything

[22-Jul-19 01:01 AM] Caglio#3337
cos every guy in kmd owns only 400$

[22-Jul-19 01:01 AM] JimD#9272
I will buy more, its cool

[22-Jul-19 01:01 AM] JimD#9272
we have to win the popularity contest

[22-Jul-19 01:02 AM] Caglio#3337
Obviously only discord users are buying more kmd

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
i cant imagine how things will not go apeshit when the mobile dex goes live. it just destroys everything else out there.

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] Caglio#3337
Wont change a single thing

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] JimD#9272
Gotta get those network effects from users

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] Caglio#3337
We might get 30% green candle

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] JimD#9272
who is KMDs PR guy

[22-Jul-19 01:03 AM] Caglio#3337
and then 34% red

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] Caglio#3337
I should be, honestly

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
Someone needs to be shilling this 24/7

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] Caglio#3337
Those who dont want to buy kmd, or say eos is better

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] Caglio#3337
well we beat them up and throw them in a thrash can outside

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
That is just ignorant

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
caglio would get sued for harassment at the first conference

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] Caglio#3337
so next time they wont talk

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
EOS is a glorified database

[22-Jul-19 01:04 AM] Caglio#3337
Probably action, probably

[22-Jul-19 01:05 AM] actionslacks#4072
but you still got my vote caglio

[22-Jul-19 01:05 AM] Caglio#3337
There is that little bitch bitcoin maximalist

[22-Jul-19 01:05 AM] Caglio#3337
He was fighting with that other little cunt roger ver

[22-Jul-19 01:05 AM] Caglio#3337
IF you remember, when ver flipped and started to show him middle fingers

It seems like many people like $KMD $LINK & $TOMO right now...

Give me one solid reason why youâ€™re interested in this project.

[22-Jul-19 01:05 AM] Caglio#3337
And the other bitch went bcash bcash bcash

[22-Jul-19 01:06 AM] Caglio#3337
I would take their souls

[22-Jul-19 01:06 AM] Caglio#3337
Specially that maximalist one, he was so rude

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] JimD#9272
crypto is pretty tribal

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] JimD#9272
battle of the moonboys

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] JimD#9272
well see if tech wins out in the end

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] Caglio#3337
Probably not

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] p.#1126
lool

[22-Jul-19 01:07 AM] Caglio#3337
At least not kmd tech that noone knows cos we cannot afford a normal marketing

[22-Jul-19 01:08 AM] p.#1126
alt hell

[22-Jul-19 01:08 AM] p.#1126
meet u there

[22-Jul-19 01:08 AM] Caglio#3337
But some other shitcoin that isnt good at all, but people heard about it, cos someone invested few thousands

[22-Jul-19 01:09 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, seems to be the way things work ATM

[22-Jul-19 01:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
considering the target most projects are gunning for we should all be working together. cumbuya and shit man

[22-Jul-19 01:09 AM] Caglio#3337
@p. bring ur kalash

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] JimD#9272
I have to imagine as time goes on and more and more projects die off because they are shitcoins, people will look for alternatives and find KMD

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] Caglio#3337
That wont happen jim

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] Caglio#3337
Just look @ the numbers

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] Caglio#3337
5 shitcoins are born and maybe 1 dies

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] Caglio#3337
So there will just be even more and more shitcoins

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Shitcoin hydra

[22-Jul-19 01:10 AM] Caglio#3337
for someone to recognize kmd, 80% of coins should die right now

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
May happen

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Caglio#3337
Prolly not

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Caglio#3337
It didnt happen in 2017

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Caglio#3337
And whales are earning money on those coins anyway

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Most coins are dreadfully low on liquidity

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] p.#1126
new coins replacing old ones now

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] p.#1126
and not many stick

[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but on a bigger ratio

[22-Jul-19 01:12 AM] JimD#9272
ya, I think it takes a lot more to pull out a successful coin than it used too

[22-Jul-19 01:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
kmd has been open to the integration and acceptance of any other project's coin into the atomic dex since this whole thing started. rvn fanbois dissing kmd in their discord while kmd is actively working to integrate them into mobile dex

[22-Jul-19 01:12 AM] JimD#9272
coins can't be pure shit anymore

[22-Jul-19 01:12 AM] p.#1126
i heard kmd hired keanu reeves as a spokesperson

[22-Jul-19 01:12 AM] JimD#9272
When do we buy our superbowl add

[22-Jul-19 01:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
you gonna trust joe sixpack with the private key to his 401k?

[22-Jul-19 01:13 AM] Caglio#3337
I think I messed up a lot

[22-Jul-19 01:13 AM] Caglio#3337
I invested back in 2017, and had profits, good ones

[22-Jul-19 01:13 AM] Caglio#3337
I havent sold

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
Then 2018 happened

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
But the biggest fail I did

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] JimD#9272
weeeeeee

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
Was the investing in coins at the first place

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
I should have come into crypto world, yes for sure

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
But to scam people

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] p.#1126
buy btc and stick it up your ass

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] Caglio#3337
Money is to be made here, but not by investing in crypto

[22-Jul-19 01:14 AM] JimD#9272
I only invest for the 10X

[22-Jul-19 01:15 AM] JimD#9272
and anything I make off the 10X goes into the 100x
