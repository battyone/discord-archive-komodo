No argument here

[22-Nov-18 08:40 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
The need for the US gov to get their piece of crypto taxes, and KYC requirements, is almost taking US investors out of the primary markets (without work arounds). That sucks beyond belief

[22-Nov-18 08:41 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
* Don't mind paying fair taxes at all, but preventing us from being able to stay on the early opportunities is criminal

[22-Nov-18 08:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
The financial oligarchs in control of the status quo are very afraid. Hence the attacks and fear mongering. It‚Äôs gonna come to a head sooner or later. This movement cant be stopped.

Kmd being under the radar could be a blessing as far as getting traction in the states

[22-Nov-18 08:46 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
I agree. But we definitely are going to have to fight along the way, I think. Upheaval and change of the status quo is going to meet massive resistance.

[22-Nov-18 08:46 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
And the markets are already being heavily manipulated by those with the major resources

[22-Nov-18 08:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
It could be the fight of our lives, I‚Äôm ready.

You and me both, brother. I'm an honorably discharged US Marine. Would have died for my country. But not for the 1%. For what we should be as a free nation, not what we are currently

[22-Nov-18 08:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thanks for your service. the tech is getting closer to ready. The real challenge will be educating the public imo.

[22-Nov-18 08:51 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
Appreciate the thx. Very different now than back in the Vietnam era. Totally agree on getting the public (sheeple) to rise to the challenge. We're on the cutting edge here, but many people I mention these things to give me a blank stare

[22-Nov-18 08:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah their eyes glaze over almost instantly it seems

[22-Nov-18 08:52 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
yep.. thats the frustrating part. At least for me.

[22-Nov-18 08:53 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
They don't get it. How much privacy they've lost. How little freedom they actually have. Or how the corporate interests are bleeding them dry

People do seem to understand how the prices of things keep going up at the grocery store or the endless rise of rent. I usually start with the fed. But  yeah. I think there are enough people into it for speculative reasons now that its getting pretty big. Just need to point out that it was born in response to the banker bailout. Everyone pretty much hates the bailouts I‚Äôve found.

[22-Nov-18 08:57 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
Satoshi's main driving force. Yes... that's a good point. Feed that anger in the bailouts. Hasn't gone away

[22-Nov-18 08:57 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
Good angle to use

[22-Nov-18 08:59 AM] CRYPTOFUTURE#6398
K.... thanks for letting me vent @actionslacks , lol. Just popped in to see what's going on here. Best regards and have a great Thanksgiving. Got to redirect a Z9 mini to another coin and check the markets. TTYL

Hang in there, @Vertigo .  Looks like market cap is plunging again.  We can all have a good laugh at ourselves and know that this is the work we put in... dealing with this roller-coaster.  if it pays off, we can then chuckle at the haters

my 22k is 1.5k because I bought new miners, does that count?

I think we may have some break from drops now. Drops probably initiated by some event (some big player selling). If it stop we should see some increase.

Not saying that it has or hasn't, but how does anyone know what the bottom is at this point?

You won't know capitulation for sure until it happens. Should be pretty clear with hindsight.

Also wouldn't rule out another big drop. Another descending triangle forming which might well break down again

judging from some of the youtube peeps i follow, another drop is indeed coming

[23-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But isnt it usually that when everyone sees the drop coming, the drop will not come?

[23-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As when everyone expects a drop, you should already have sold/be selling

[23-Nov-18 04:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So the drop should already be occurring
