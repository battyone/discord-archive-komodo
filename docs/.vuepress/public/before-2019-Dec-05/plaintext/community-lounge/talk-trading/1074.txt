JUST IN 

as per sir @loomdart ‚Äòs request, this thread is abt the on-going sells off made by PLUS Token, the biggest Chinese PONZI which scammed ~70K $BTC + ~ 800K $ETH 

I mentioned it briefly in my last Coindesk oped but worth additional attention as it may cause furth...

I think this is one of the largest bids I've ever seen on bittrex 

looks like the $VBK team are using IEO funds.. to uhh.. buy the token back at less than a tenth? of IEO price

I love crypto.

How much a recession can affect on the price of Bitcoin and the rest of the top and bottom alt coins, and in what period of time span?

[15-Aug-19 04:13 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It would be really bad.  Crypto isn‚Äôt developed enough as a stand-in for fiat so probably would be liquidated first.

Bitcoin's price could fall 50% from today's price of $10,600 and the digital currency would still be outperforming the S&P 500 in 2019.

Paradoxically yes.   Even though more money being printed to correct growth rates should raise the ‚Äúprice‚Äù , crypto‚Äôs utility as a store of value diminishes due to other needs having a higher marginal utility.  An example : a recession hits and the company you work for goes under and it‚Äôs hard to find work due to increased competition.   Would the normal person have an issue of liquidating their crypto for life needs ( still have to eat pay rent etc. ) .  I believe they wouldn‚Äôt . On a larger scale, if credit access is restricted companies may tighten their belts in regard to how much they are willing to exchange for ( crypto will cost more to get and get less if sold ) .   Alts have it worse as it will spark a bank run to bitcoin and other fiat liquid alts.

[15-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Flint#6435
from this wedge there really should be a high breakthrough upwards, but when and how much this wedge will continue to decline is not even clear even under analysis. the market has not yet decided on bitcoin! But for us this is already a good opportunity, and maybe the last one to buy at such a cheap price! then you can regret after 2-3 years that you didn‚Äôt buy and vice versa - if you buy for 2-3 years, then in any case there will be a good increase in investment!

[15-Aug-19 06:14 PM] jspook16#3059

Now is the perfect time to accumulate bottomed out KMD ecosystem projects. Dollar value quite low, btc value REKT, kmd value semi-rekt. Personally accumulating hush and labs but ARRR looks amazing and Verus is always a good buy

[15-Aug-19 08:15 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
think of it as an even more degen way to stack KMD, instead of diversifying into altcoins for more bitcoin, you're diversifying KMD shitcoin holdings to pick up ultra shitcoins for more kmd
