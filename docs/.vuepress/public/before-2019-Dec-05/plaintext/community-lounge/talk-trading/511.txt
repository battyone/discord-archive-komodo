Seems like BNB is one of the few coins to actually have inverse correlation with btc

🚨 THIS IS HUGE: the SEC just released an official statement on “Framework for ‘Investment Contract’ Analysis of Digital Assets” analyzing whether a digital asset is a security or not

because when I want to know what an SEC report says, I always turn to twatter instead of the actual report

Why does KMD need 120 confirmations on a deposit on Binance?

[03-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because they’re tards?

[03-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bittrex is only 30 iirc

[03-Apr-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CoinKing88 because they did it to all equihash coins in 1 blanket move and never singled KMD out

[03-Apr-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
binance uses some custom way to detect confirmations

[03-Apr-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so dpowconfs didnt automatically work for them

[03-Apr-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if it did, we would ask them to set it to 20 or 30

[03-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Caglio#3337
120 is just plain stupid

[03-Apr-19 04:21 PM] Caglio#3337
2 hours...

[03-Apr-19 04:21 PM] Alecandro#1179
my god, KMD just cannot stand up to btc moving at all lol

[03-Apr-19 04:25 PM] Markus#5464
btc getting rly close to 21 monthly ema line....last bear market it touched that line and got rejected and dropped 40%

[03-Apr-19 04:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so you mean unless btc goes sideway, kmd has no chance to rise ? 😂

[03-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Correct

[03-Apr-19 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Even then

[03-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
More advanced competitors have entered the market now

[03-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD is obsolete

[03-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

i dont se KMD dumping against USD though

[03-Apr-19 04:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
was that really the reason for the doge pump?

[03-Apr-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes

[03-Apr-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
doge is very susceptible to twitter pumps

Im sure KMD would pump too if Elon Musk posted something about it though

[03-Apr-19 05:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean, its not hard to understand why 😂

[03-Apr-19 05:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So this rally is based on the premise that the SEC is re-evaluating their position about digital assets in general?

[03-Apr-19 05:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im sure they will do some ambiguous comment to dump the price again :p

[03-Apr-19 05:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It just feels so accurate.   Especially when you listen to the first.  
He said and 5 times in a row and used the words "finanical System" as 80% of a 12 word sentence.
They should have edited it better 😂

[03-Apr-19 05:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I cant hate on the guy for trying.  Hes just what we need to get the masses interested.
