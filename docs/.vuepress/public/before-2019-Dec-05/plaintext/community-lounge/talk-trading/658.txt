“Mining pirate” will be to crypto fund sourcing as “tragic boating accident” is to gun owners losing outlawed weapons

“You mined $87 million worth of pirate?  Really?”

What's the context? Jus woke up. Didn't read chat.

[17-May-19 09:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yes, I secretly developed 0.0000087 nm mining chips

[17-May-19 09:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
what's an outlawed weapon? thought you can still legally own an AT4 as long as you point it the right way

[17-May-19 09:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In USSA, some states outlawed scary looking versions of semi-auto rifles

yeah.. why did u  @phm87?

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
I don t plan to short it. I just need to know where we can short it to hedge

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
isn't that an intention to short?!

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
No

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
One of the CC’s?

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
Short is not bad btw

[17-May-19 09:44 PM] phm87#7395
Shorters fuels price up when they are wrong

[17-May-19 09:45 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's not what she said

[17-May-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395
Short is more risky than hodl. You can loose 100% with shorts

[17-May-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395

Short is just selling to buy more back later a lesser price

[17-May-19 09:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You probably mean leverage?

[17-May-19 09:48 PM] phm87#7395
Serious traders talk about all trading tools (perpetual swaps, futures, ...)

[17-May-19 09:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sidenote regarding the trading history, isnt that just an easy excuse to not have to serve you anymore? I mean who in their right mind keeps track of all trades for 6 years?

[17-May-19 09:49 PM] phm87#7395
No I mean to short. I never used leverage

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then a short is just selling now to buy back later at a lower price?

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] phm87#7395
Yes

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That is litterally the definition of going short

{Reactions}
😂 

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can sell on any exchange?

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Keep the btc/usd

[17-May-19 09:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Wait for kmd/btc price to drop

[17-May-19 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Buy with the same amt of btc more kmd than before

[17-May-19 09:51 PM] phm87#7395
But if your bet is wrong, you will be forced to buy then it will fuel up price. So shorts fuel price up (when bet is wrong)

[17-May-19 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So as I said what you are asking is leverage

[17-May-19 09:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont think it is offered anywhere for kmd

[17-May-19 09:52 PM] phm87#7395
Leverage is sth different I think

[17-May-19 09:52 PM] phm87#7395
If price is going down and I bet on it, I should do a short

[17-May-19 09:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The only way shorts get liquidated is when price moves too low that they are forced to leave their position

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-May-19 09:52 PM] phm87#7395
Leverage is that if I want to trade with 1 kmd having effects of 4 kmd. 4x leverage

[17-May-19 09:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And that is only the case when they first ‘borrow’ = leverage the kmd to then sell the kmd to buy back later

[17-May-19 09:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The profit/loss is the difference in kmd when you close the position

{Reactions}
👌 

[17-May-19 09:54 PM] phm87#7395
Yes the borrow thing but you cannot withdraw these borrowed coins (if short with leverage)

[17-May-19 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You can do 2x etc but then the leverage is higher, you just borrow more

[17-May-19 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But 1x is also leverage 😃

[17-May-19 09:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(If that makes sense)

[17-May-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
Without leverage and only with shorts (leverage -1x if you want), its possible to loose all your balance. Short is risky

[17-May-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
But ok I will search for exchanges to hedge

[17-May-19 09:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Long is too if your coin becomes worthless

[17-May-19 09:56 PM] phm87#7395
In my head, it should exist on DEX

[17-May-19 09:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
#cc-prices might do this I think
