BTC is an ancient dinosaur, which should not be 'fixed', but allowed to die and become extinct, to make way for new and improved tech driven currency

[19-Jun-19 04:04 PM] Malti#3948

[19-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Malti#3948
could just be that electrum server is out of sync for a little while. try again in a bit 😃

[19-Jun-19 04:08 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
0.5.6

[19-Jun-19 04:08 PM] Malti#3948
