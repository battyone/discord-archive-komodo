[15-Jul-19 08:14 PM] CoinKing88#1540
yeah JL is a secret reference to a bullmarket and bearmarket graph, 777 is the price of KMD in 2022.

That old guy looks like a pedo

[15-Jul-19 09:22 PM] dan.#2473
That was the rebrand :troll:

[15-Jul-19 09:24 PM] Malti#3948
Seems like atomicdex channel is open

[15-Jul-19 09:24 PM] Malti#3948
So things are getting through, slowly

[15-Jul-19 09:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Worth waiting

[15-Jul-19 09:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
Ron Paul is who indirectly got me into bitcoin. I think the pedos in washington are pretty much identified at this point. It's not Ron Paul, otherwise he probably would have had a chance at President.

[15-Jul-19 09:38 PM] richardt#2807
Don't know about you guys, but pump or no pump, I'm just excited for KMD to finally release something on time and as planned 😃

[15-Jul-19 09:41 PM] Alecandro#1179

[15-Jul-19 10:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@richardt pumps are short term anyway. I hope this is the start of the Komodo awareness campaign 😃 That will give us long term price appreciation and acceptance in this crypto space.

[15-Jul-19 10:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Lieutenant too much emotion from a AI

troll_cool 

[15-Jul-19 10:13 PM] richardt#2807
Yeah, finally getting recognition for all of the innovations is more valuable than anything

[15-Jul-19 10:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep, i hope KMD being known will also shift the cryptospace away from all the marketing vaporware and projects with actual tech gets the market caps they deserve.

[15-Jul-19 10:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Litecoin at however many billions for being 2nd is silly.

[15-Jul-19 10:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
All the bitcoin gold/diamond/whatever goes to 0

[15-Jul-19 10:15 PM] COCO#8088
Any news to pump it ?

[15-Jul-19 10:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
i failed my diet......dont know if that is worthy of a pump

[15-Jul-19 10:16 PM] richardt#2807
If it was Litecoin announcing an atomic DEX, it would have been pumped to >$1k by now

[15-Jul-19 10:17 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and bitcoin gold and diamond wouldve also pumped w it

[15-Jul-19 10:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes exactly,the thing here is that, the best tech or innovation in general does not matter, until it does

[15-Jul-19 10:17 PM] hyperDEX#6586
With the US stance taken, that will matter more than anything soon

[15-Jul-19 10:19 PM] COCO#8088
When announce?

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio dont equate being 2nd to good.

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Litecoin is sponsor of ufc

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Caglio#3337
and now that rugby team

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What was their ROI?

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Caglio#3337
ROI ?

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I have no idea

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Pornhub got paid $2M by Verge, what was their ROI?

[15-Jul-19 10:20 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
Caglio logic: sponsors sports team, therefore has quality tech
