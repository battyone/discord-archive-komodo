If you know, then things are as they are... if you do not know, they still are as they are.

We know.  They know that we know.  But we pretend to not know and they pretend to not know that we know.  Everybody knows.

lol Coinbene is a joke

[05-Mar-19 06:06 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Seems like a strong exchange but hey maybe it's not for us.  Jerry was a nice dude to work with but ultimately It wasn't a fit for us at this time.

to be honest, the bull will stop when it stops rallying

[05-Mar-19 06:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
you can always see it as a future KMD bull run in the coming months? üòÉ

[05-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Markus#5464
it will be interesting to see where KMD price will land end of upcoming bull market end

[05-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Markus#5464

Discusses risk, finance, decision making, markets and more.

The audio gets ironed out after the first 2 minutes.  It's messed up at first.

"Trade is a mutually beneficial process... a transaction in which both parties perceive themselves as wealthier than before.  What a radical idea."

Sounds like some JL777 type shit to say.

@Markus it does seem that the next bullrun will take into consideration projects with real strong development and software that works

[05-Mar-19 11:11 PM] PTYX#6840
Komodo will be on that train

Hm we will see, on 2 day chart macd is about to cross downwards

[06-Mar-19 10:48 PM] Markus#5464
when that happened on 1 day chart we fell from 27k to 22k

[06-Mar-19 10:52 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
27k was unnatural and anomalous

[06-Mar-19 11:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How dare you use averages and not the tops of candles for your hopium charts!

you think the volume is fake?

[07-Mar-19 01:31 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
is this all time high for volume?

[07-Mar-19 01:36 AM] Markus#5464
check their orderbook and u will understand üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 01:36 AM] Markus#5464
0 movement

[07-Mar-19 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Average volume is 1-3% of coin supply

[07-Mar-19 01:36 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Today is crazy

[07-Mar-19 01:36 AM] Markus#5464
binance got way more legit volume then huobi

[07-Mar-19 01:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shots fired

[07-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
BNB is still pumping

[07-Mar-19 03:51 AM] PTYX#6840
It's good to see Huobi's tactics in action

[07-Mar-19 03:51 AM] PTYX#6840
It could be faked volume or a cmc glitch

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Markus#5464
well if u go to huobi u do see the volume displayed on CMC

{Reactions}
üëå 

[07-Mar-19 03:53 AM] Markus#5464
so its on Huobis side

[07-Mar-19 04:16 AM] Markus#5464
BNB 200% price gain in 90 days

[07-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
BNB 16.55% 24 hr change

[07-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
if it does that for the next 23 days straight, it will beat BTC marketcap

[07-Mar-19 04:44 AM] Markus#5464
this wont end well üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 04:45 AM] Markus#5464
many ppl will get rekt by the dip

[07-Mar-19 04:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I heard that to participate in token sale you have to buy BNB

[07-Mar-19 04:46 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so everytime there is token sale, BNB price goes up

[07-Mar-19 04:46 AM] Markus#5464
RSI on weekly chart is 89 for BNB

[07-Mar-19 04:46 AM] Markus#5464
actually 90 even

[07-Mar-19 04:47 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it was set up like ethereum

[07-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So i think it might overtake ETH place if it keeps going

[07-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Markus#5464
idk what will be so special about it

[07-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Markus#5464
their blockchain wont have smartcontracts even

[07-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
ME neither, I will just enjoy the ride with my small bag and cash out üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Markus#5464
üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 04:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the quarterly token burning, the employees prefer being paid in BNB, 100k to apply for their DEX listings , exchange fee discounts

[07-Mar-19 04:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not sure what else

[07-Mar-19 04:51 AM] Markus#5464
i dont get it being paid in BNB as employee, crypto space is not rly that huge yet to pay stuff like ur bills with crypto

[07-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but currently the push is done by people who wants to participate in the ICOs, that's my take anyway

[07-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
they have fiat gateways for BNB already as well

[07-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Markus#5464
but this hype is extreme, ppl push price like the coins will run out, as if supply would be similar to btc

[07-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Asian likes to gamble

[07-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Markus#5464
its a gamble to get paid in BNB also, imagine u get paid idk 2000$ worth of BNB and once u get paid price drop 5%

[07-Mar-19 04:55 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
40% hold by the team

[07-Mar-19 04:56 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
10% by angel investors

[07-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
also a rumor about validator node almost like masternode

[07-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Markus#5464
interesting üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 04:59 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so the RSI might be similar to eth during the last super bull

[07-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But i got in around .0013

[07-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Markus#5464
RSI was at 95 for btc end of 2017

[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I just hope that binance won't get hacked anytime soon üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
IT will kill the momentum

[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Markus#5464
interesting that eth actually had a huge run in mid 2017 before the big run end of 2017

[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Markus#5464
didnt know that üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Markus#5464
it was bigger in mid 2017

[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the ICOs rush

[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Markus#5464
it peaked at 0.15 btc a piece

[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Markus#5464
damn

[07-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, so my sell target will be around that probably

[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
üòÑ

[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
imagine if u sold at that top then bought it back before end of year run

[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
then sold again

[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
thats huge

[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the only thing that can stop the momentum is hacking and or CZ got hit by bus , So i can only pray

[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Markus#5464
i feel binance got pretty good security

[07-Mar-19 05:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yes, they do

[07-Mar-19 05:09 AM] Markus#5464
but then again everything is hackable nothing is 100% bulletproof

huh, rollercoaster action for KMD on binance

[07-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Mark81#4505
24h volume over 17 million usd for kmd now.

[07-Mar-19 06:37 AM] Mark81#4505
Mostly from huobi pairs.

[07-Mar-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
people complained about low volume

[07-Mar-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
now it is high volume, people complain about the high volume

[07-Mar-19 06:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Well isnt high volume good thing? It tells about people being interested.
