[30-May-19 06:20 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
Realistic way of solving scaling is to have lots of shitcoins

[30-May-19 06:20 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912
But too much shitcoins crash the market

[30-May-19 06:21 AM] ì°¨ë¯¸ìˆ™#8912

[30-May-19 07:00 AM] Bittersweet#9376
no

[30-May-19 07:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
if supernet cashes iota out at anything over a 1$ that's an awful lot of kmd

[30-May-19 07:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
This market just seem like people are panic buying anything bitcoin related or with any semblance of legitimacy

[30-May-19 08:10 AM] LocoMB#8593
I doubt that supernet will cash out any more IOTA, becuase they already did, with humongous profit.
Since IOTA is poised to go intergalactic, forfeiting that possible ride would be bad strategy. but that's just my opinion... ðŸŒŒ ðŸŒŒ ðŸš€  ðŸŒŒ

@LocoMB I agree with you.

[30-May-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
I half agree

[30-May-19 08:52 AM] jorian#4555
james is still in ARRR halving mode

[30-May-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
lol

[30-May-19 09:12 AM] klein#5233
completely disagree

[30-May-19 09:13 AM] klein#5233
If its going to be a komodo eco system asset, it should divest non komodo assets

[30-May-19 09:14 AM] klein#5233
There is also the opportunity cost with not investing all of these IOTA funds into komodo based assets

[30-May-19 09:15 AM] klein#5233
What shows the most promise of growth?

[30-May-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
ARRR mining rewards have halved

[30-May-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
nethash is down only about 30%

[30-May-19 09:26 AM] klein#5233
@grewalsatinder  @LocoMB  has anything significantly changed lately with IOTA? last I checked it was a steaming pile of shit

[30-May-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
not trolling just curious/uninformed

[30-May-19 09:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sometimes I truest the crowed ðŸ˜„

[30-May-19 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just have a speculative opinion on IOTA
