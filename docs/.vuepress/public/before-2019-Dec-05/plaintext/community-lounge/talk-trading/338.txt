$BTC update: Did you sell everything yet?
They are lying to you! $BTC is the worst performing asset of the last decade! It has been in a ear market since 2011 you plebs

The text "In 2011, BTC couldn't break the resistance and has since been in a bear market" seems, uh, suspect.  This has been a bear market this whole time?

[10-Dec-18 02:20 AM] bishop#9773
Yep, with higher and higher highs. Makes sense.

Is binance Dex like barterdex?

[10-Dec-18 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No

[10-Dec-18 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is like Waves or NXT

@hastrup

[10-Dec-18 11:43 AM] hastrup#8742
Then it's not a Dex why are they saying that they are a Dex

[10-Dec-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an onchain DEX, since all transactions on a single chain are atomic actions, it is even an atomic swap DEX, just not cross chain

[10-Dec-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the cross chain part that makes it difficult

[10-Dec-18 01:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
WTB ZEC with KMD

[10-Dec-18 01:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[10-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Acura#2748
WTS DEX / BOTS for KMD

[10-Dec-18 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
anyone that can put up some ZEC/KMD orders up in barterdex? would appreciate it

[10-Dec-18 03:39 PM] tolken#2655

[10-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Are there any exchanges

[10-Dec-18 04:04 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[10-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Anyone looking for 3000kmd

[10-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
At current rate on digital price with 5% discount

[10-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Which is already quite a bit lower than binance

[10-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Will be putting order up soon

[10-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
4500kmd*

[10-Dec-18 04:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@tolken im looking to buy some ZEC, if it can be on barterdex, better.

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Kmd @ 5-10% below market will be up on digital price in 5 more confirmations

[10-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Grab yourself a double bargain

[10-Dec-18 04:31 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
A bargain on a bargain

[10-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Vertigo#0439
Is that exchange safe?

[10-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Vertigo#0439
Never used it before

[10-Dec-18 05:02 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
yes, I believe a lot of komodo assetchains use it, have had no problems so far

[10-Dec-18 05:03 PM] Vertigo#0439

we seen a spike from 1300

[10-Dec-18 09:52 PM] yorklab#7270
No idea. Bitcoin controls much of the Alt's price, so who knows.

[10-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Twitch.KNZN#9717
and volume looks very weak but there isnt much sell action so alot off long term investorsd

Are you sure you've got the right fishyguts?

[11-Dec-18 01:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Check the #5085 after the name. There was a scammer impersonating him a month or so ago, could be that. Unless you're trolling. Because FishyGuts is trustworthy and many would vouch for him

[11-Dec-18 01:32 AM] Stinkfist#7610
yes i have the right guy

[11-Dec-18 01:33 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Okay, well I'd just wait to hear back from him. He is a trusted member of the community.

[11-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Stinkfist#7610
i sent him .024 bitcoin for 2100 C25 over 24 hours ago . said he would send me my coins after 2  confirmations and  have yet to see them.. I can post our entire conversation  if that helps... i would just like what i paid for or my BTC back

[11-Dec-18 01:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It would not help, no. I haven't seen him on much the last day or two. So maybe just wait for him to get back. Again, he is a trusted member of the community

[11-Dec-18 01:43 AM] Stinkfist#7610
he is on now, i have sent him a message everytime i see him online now i get no response, hoping this will guilt him in to doing the right thing...or i will continue to warn everyone about him

[11-Dec-18 01:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I will see if I can get in contact with him

[11-Dec-18 01:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So my friend who had eth last January was told by me to sell at least his original investment.  He didn‚Äôt. 


Now he just asked me ‚Äúeth is $2 above where I bought it, should I sell?‚Äù

I love the Smells of capitulation in the morning.

[11-Dec-18 01:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Stinkfist I assure you that was not me.  
Go to the private chat and click the user.  What‚Äôs the # after their name? 
I was at the LA auto show all day yesterday and 4x4 all day before that.  Definitely did no crypto stuff this weekend.

[11-Dec-18 01:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What is c25?

[11-Dec-18 01:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Post the conversation is fine but check the # after the user.  

We‚Äôve had people impersonate me in the past on pirate.

[11-Dec-18 01:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Does it still say FishyGuts with my pic or deleted user?

[11-Dec-18 01:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I keep having shossain or others block the frauds.

[11-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Stinkfist#7610
well this sucks...

[11-Dec-18 01:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@SHossain can you block FishyGuts6295

[11-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Stinkfist#7610
yep everything is the same

[11-Dec-18 01:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I lost 390 KMD last month trying to buy those A9s the guy was selling in the mining room.

[11-Dec-18 01:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I feel your pain.  

Luckily @Deleted User is working on a solution for trading OTC.

sorry man didnt even know that was something you can, why does discord allow that, same name...

[11-Dec-18 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Man we need to finish the blockchain based caht dAPP... that helps a fair bit... as each person is a pubkey with a name as their alias... reamoves hte abilty for impersonation.

[11-Dec-18 01:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
No need to be sorry.   Communication solves most problems.   The admins will ban that user but someone can do it again.  Sad, I agree.

[11-Dec-18 01:55 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So Pirate wants to fight that.   We have a discord Escrow bot in development AND @Deleted User is working on another solution too.

[11-Dec-18 01:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Like every chat platfrom allows this stupid thing... but short of having KYC for discord, what can you even do about it lol.

[11-Dec-18 01:55 AM] Hermes#6934
I dont see the alias anymore

[11-Dec-18 01:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
WHats the name in your chat log now @Stinkfist ?

[11-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Hermes#6934
if you see him again let me know and I will ban him

[11-Dec-18 01:56 AM] FishyGuts#5085
