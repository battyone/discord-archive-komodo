The power we are seeking to unleash with the 2020 campaign is not the power of John McAfee. It is the power of the individual.

[19-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
For a good two years bitcoindark was stable at 1 dollar. There was a few times it dropped lower, mid 60 cents, but it always came back to 1 dollar. Then it shot up to over 100 dollars after the KMD swap mostly from whale games. I'm seeing KMD staying around that 1 dollar mark kind of like bitcoindark has done.

[19-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
