lol I'm not surprised

[26-Apr-19 12:00 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
That looks too much like an excuse to dump. Why does New York thoughts on bitfinex matter when Americans are not even allowed to trade on the exchange except through VPN? The thing with tether is their own problem.

[26-Apr-19 12:01 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`‚ÄúOAG has reason to believe that Bitfinex still allows New York-based individual investors to deposit, trade, and withdraw virtual currencies. and engage in other transactions. on the Bitfinex trading platform.‚Äù`
And we're surprised that a company in China doesn't hold themselves accountable to some random **state law** in the US, right?

[26-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Also look at the fact a whole lot of longs were closing hours before this news hit and it looks to be whales playing games.

They will

[26-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[26-Apr-19 02:13 AM] klein#5233
"RFOX can be purchased using USDT only"

[26-Apr-19 02:13 AM] PTYX#6840
Probably best to ask them

[26-Apr-19 02:14 AM] PTYX#6840
And not make any assumptions.
