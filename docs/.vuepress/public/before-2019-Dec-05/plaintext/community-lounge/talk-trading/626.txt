We looking to add VPN and VPS payment options soon.   I've been unable to do some direct sales but I will have some time here soon to start beating the streets with a marketing campaign.

[10-May-19 04:52 AM] FishyGuts#5085
After next week.  Our newest main dev quit his fucking job to work on Pirate, so ... you know... no pressure to succeed or anything.

Bitcoin at important price level

We are currently at monthly resistance: https://www.tradingview.com/x/HLpHgKRO

This is very important area. We may see some spikes above but this is the last area bears have to step in otherwise Bitcoin is coming above $7000 in day or two.

[10-May-19 01:52 PM] Tek#5253

[10-May-19 01:52 PM] Tek#5253
if things progress well I technically don't need to cash out and I just use crypto cards or whatever, pay with crypt directly

exiting ain't that easy- Q is always what are you gonna do with it, and what about the taxman

[10-May-19 02:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
I think no real crypto HODLer is going to sell BTC and keep $500k in a BofA or Citi cash account, or buy bonds or FAAANG or some other garbage - that doesnt leave much

[10-May-19 02:20 PM] LocoMB#8593
thinking in Bitcoin as Andreas keeps saying - wtf am I going to do with a piece of paper saying that JPMorgan owes me $500k?

üòÖ oh well, that'll solve the pension crisis for sure, so instead of keeping all your money in BTC, maybe think about diversifying, e.g. into LYFT
