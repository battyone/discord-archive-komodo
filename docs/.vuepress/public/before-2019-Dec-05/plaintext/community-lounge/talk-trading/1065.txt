What do you guys recommend to pick up at these levels, pirate or kmd?

[12-Aug-19 05:14 AM] house#8741
@jspook16 ... i'd be willing to bet that Pirate makes a %100 move before komodo.
Both are great buys at this level though

[12-Aug-19 06:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For sure

[12-Aug-19 07:19 AM] tolken#2655
Beer...  anyone still selling that? üòõ

[12-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Gordon Komodo dominance topped for now

[12-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Money flow into alts

[12-Aug-19 08:19 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not sure how long

[12-Aug-19 08:21 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@house why has nobody forked or replicated pirate all private transactions yet ???

[12-Aug-19 08:21 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I own pirate but I am unsure , if it was so gamechanging where are the cloners

[12-Aug-19 08:27 AM] Oszy#5734
well there's one that stole the name and brand at least, mr pirate cash from russia üòÑ PoS + Bridge Dex forked he's so proud of himself

[12-Aug-19 09:01 AM] house#8741
It‚Äôs not a mainstream thing @mrtzmp3 Private only transactions is a very niche project template. Of course you can easy fork it, but as we are the pioneers in the space I suspect people are watching to see how it pans out. As you can see, most people are in crypto for trading to make money, I can‚Äôt lie, so am I, but I value the technology and am sticking to my guns and putting my money where I believe the most innovation is taking place. As such, I see Komodo and Pirate as top of the heap. Let the kids play their trading games üòâ

bad news for alts

[12-Aug-19 01:33 PM] Markus#5464
btc dominance bounced 2 times testing support

That 72% is significant resistance

[12-Aug-19 04:22 PM] washparkdlt#6482
If it breaks 72 it has room up to 80%+

[12-Aug-19 04:23 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I personally think btc risk is to the downside

[12-Aug-19 04:25 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Potential retest of 9kish strikes me as the highest probability but who knows

interesting is binance twitting about KMD but little impact on the price

[12-Aug-19 04:31 PM] tolken#2655
Interesting.

[12-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Markus#5464
no worries

[12-Aug-19 04:33 PM] Markus#5464
its actually perfect

[12-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Looks like some action on binance now

[12-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
What did Binance tweet about KMD?

[12-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Some trivia q about the usd value of the airdrop

[12-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why anyone would think that would drive action is beyond me

[12-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
ahh gocha, must have missed that one haha

[12-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
obvious C.$200,000 since it before was 250k and price went down

[12-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
$87 now

[12-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Was $400k

[12-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sign up, get rekt

[12-Aug-19 05:14 PM] Markus#5464
but i dont see how a quiz tweet would push price

[12-Aug-19 05:14 PM] Markus#5464
like someone was expecting

[12-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Price drives news, not the other way around

[12-Aug-19 05:17 PM] phm87#7395
I received an alert: kmdbtc up. Maybe a double bottom. I will wait for another alert to confirm. Can someone do a TA of kmdbtc ? Thx

[12-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464
too early to call it a double bottom

[12-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464
its up less then 10%

[12-Aug-19 05:18 PM] phm87#7395
I agree

[12-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Bitfinger#6245
4hr bull div, like I said yesterday

[12-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Markus#5464
we have had divergence on daily and weekly for long

[12-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
kinda have to close above 17k to confirm that downtrend is broken

[12-Aug-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
or atleast create a higher low

[12-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Andersen#8337

Use firefly to read divergence. Daily and weekly are not nearly as clear as 4hr, but the higher tf divergence has to be triggered sometime

[12-Aug-19 06:13 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
getting close to being up 7.77%

[12-Aug-19 06:46 PM] dan.#2473
i find it unlikely this mini whale gets dumped on anytime soon

[12-Aug-19 06:46 PM] dan.#2473
he just needs to keep on keepin on

[12-Aug-19 06:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@phm87 purple line is support/resistance, if it closes above that on a timeframe you are confortable with and possibly retest it with confirmation, then it's a buy. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qbn7FB7V/

[12-Aug-19 06:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
alternatively, gamble to buy now with tight stop loss

[12-Aug-19 06:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
all this is assuming btc doesn't rekt alts again in the next days

[12-Aug-19 06:49 PM] phm87#7395
Thank you for the TA. I should have the same horizontal.
I have a bias because Iwas looking in 4H. Daily or weekly can give me the big picture

[12-Aug-19 06:54 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@phm87 mind though, the last time we were at the same situation, the retest failed. https://www.tradingview.com/x/kv9FFcfJ/

I believe it's a nice discount here anyway though for long term accumulation

[12-Aug-19 06:55 PM] phm87#7395
Indeed but btcusd movements influence whole altbtc

[12-Aug-19 06:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
let's see how usd does

[12-Aug-19 06:57 PM] phm87#7395
I have a bias compared to traders because I have a mining pool and a Notary Node that are printing alts out of fresh air. I stillneed to decide when to sell, when to hold and sometimes buy

[12-Aug-19 07:00 PM] Caglio#3337
moon mooon

[12-Aug-19 07:00 PM] Caglio#3337
lets go moon

[12-Aug-19 07:14 PM] Markus#5464
not gonna moon

[12-Aug-19 07:14 PM] Markus#5464
but it can go up abit yes, mooning would mean its too quick = sell quick

[12-Aug-19 07:21 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
current aim is to recover back to the 1.65ish area where it was stable like a month or teo ago

[12-Aug-19 07:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245

[12-Aug-19 08:08 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Any news or random pump?

[12-Aug-19 08:08 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[12-Aug-19 08:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like the bots are going to try to dump into that buy

[12-Aug-19 08:49 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@hyperDEX is the atomicdex beta generating fee that is gonna be distributed to Dex holders?
