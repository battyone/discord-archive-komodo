Actually, according to average life expectancy, I do

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
However its proven it does not work like that

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
It is already on DP...

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
and DEX

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, volume of 35$ per day

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
well, it IS there and can be traded

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jansako#3330
it was alot more liquid before

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, now imagine they start selling it on dp

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
for 0.64$

[13-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Caglio#3337
with current price of 5 cents

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] jansako#3330
so how fast or if it dumps depends on the buy side

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It is proven??? What is proven to work like what? If I would have invested 5 years ago in BTC, I'ld be rich too. Hell, if I bought at every BTC low I'ld be rich...

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Caglio#3337
You would for sure

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Caglio#3337
On ethereum also

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Caglio#3337
Litecoin would make you really happy 2

[13-Aug-19 11:35 AM] jansako#3330
they can try to sell it for 0.64, but there must be  buyer for it right?

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
Exactly jansako

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
So if they end up on binance

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
or some other exchange with big liquidity

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
they might start with a price like that

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
prolly wont hold tho

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
b ut on dp

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
the mega arb for the first 10 minutes

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
they cant do it

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] jansako#3330
or however long it takes for the deposits to arrive

[13-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Caglio#3337
hahah yeah, thats what I thought

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Caglio#3337
and then it goes back to shitty price again

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
like I said, depends on how deep pockets the buyers will have

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
potential buyers

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Well, if you think they can't keep that price level, speculate on it... Could earn you a lot of money

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Caglio#3337
how ?

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Caglio#3337
and they cant hold 0.64 cents

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
I ain't selling until 0.5 KMD per...

[13-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Shit

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337
thats not gonna happen 😄

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] jansako#3330

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] jansako#3330

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337
oh

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] jansako#3330
SN 50

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Markus#5464
Litecoin probably made their biggest mistakes i wonder if it will ever recover

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Google for 'speculative trading'... A whole new world will open... even if prices go down, there's money to be made...

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] Caglio#3337
markus ? what are you talking about ?

[13-Aug-19 11:38 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

2/ It's no secret that we have purposefully kept Litecoin's code very close to Bitcoin's code. Since we are mostly just merging in Bitcoin changes, we only need a lead Litecoin Core developer doing the merges and the rest of us help with code reviews, testing, and gitian b...

[13-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Markus#5464
litecoin is mostly top 5 cause its almost as old as bitcoin

[13-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:43 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:43 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 11:44 AM] Caglio#3337
average joe isnt interested in crypto

[13-Aug-19 11:44 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 11:45 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Aug-19 11:45 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Caglio#3337
Worst thing is

[13-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Caglio#3337

[13-Aug-19 11:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if lead dev just merges commits... is it really a tree?

[13-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Caglio#3337
I traded kmd for it 😦

[13-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
If I just bought it with cash, it would be no problem

[13-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
I just cannot believe in idea, someone will actually play those shitty graphic games

[13-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Caglio#3337
Maybe it will, but I certainly doubt it

[13-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Markus#5464
