[06-Aug-19 04:27 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Who was here during last bullrun ??

[06-Aug-19 04:27 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
At which point did alts start to moon ?? When dominance flipped or when it reached certain point going down

[06-Aug-19 04:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I suppose also bigger caps mooned first ??

[06-Aug-19 04:28 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Then middle etc

[06-Aug-19 04:43 PM] joe2x4#5987
I think it might be time to consider that cag is a paid disruptor. But blocking her/him/xer makes reading this channel much much better.üëÖ

[06-Aug-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337

So many green bars

[06-Aug-19 05:46 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Paid disruptor lol

[06-Aug-19 05:47 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
He doesn't get paid anything for disrupting , that's the sad thing

[06-Aug-19 06:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
I would rather see amusing disruption than echo-chamber KMD-tech circle jerks and talk of accumulation now to sell when KMD hits $50 in 2020.  But, hey, that's just my preference.

@meatspoon Agreed, when kmd topped back in late 2017 people would get banned for venting on the old telegram channel xD

[06-Aug-19 06:23 PM] Lanii#8302
The good ol monaize days ^^

[06-Aug-19 06:26 PM] dan.#2473

[06-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302
I was thinking of doing a write up on how to properly trade head and shoulder pattern, would anyone be interested in that?

[06-Aug-19 06:28 PM] dan.#2473
i would read it

[06-Aug-19 06:28 PM] Lanii#8302
Proper as in don't get jebaited and rekt

[06-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302

Monaize lol god that pissed me off

[06-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Thievery#4576
I'd be down @Lanii What pain patterns do you trade on with crypto?

[06-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont really trade patterns but some price action that I trade paints the head and shoulder

[06-Aug-19 06:46 PM] Lanii#8302
However I think retail is not trading it correctly

[06-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Lanii#8302
I think the way I trade it compared to the way you are supposed to trade it in text book way is more efficient.

[06-Aug-19 06:49 PM] Lanii#8302
I'll make a chart to explain

[06-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Tek#5253
No one cares about your stupid patterns

[06-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Tek#5253
> muh head and shoulders

[06-Aug-19 07:35 PM] Tek#5253
Lmao

[06-Aug-19 07:41 PM] nocturnal#2177

[06-Aug-19 07:41 PM] Tek#5253

I wouldn't worry too much about crypto. Now with the FED lowering the interest rates I can see lot's of people going to crypto for remitance and even to avoid the debt system of the FED. Not completely avoiding the system but just to mitigate the risk

[06-Aug-19 08:10 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
In certain periods of time ...5D Chess

[06-Aug-19 08:57 PM] tolken#2655
Fuckers seriously think I‚Äôm selling Kmd at these prices? I‚Äôm riding this shit to 0.

{Reactions}
üëå üëç 

[06-Aug-19 08:57 PM] tolken#2655
come one come all and dump your Kmd. Let‚Äôs do this shit.

[06-Aug-19 09:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Well btc possibly about to take huge dump. Kmd bots selling beforehand

[06-Aug-19 09:03 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
My theory

[06-Aug-19 09:06 PM] dan.#2473
kmd aint going to 0

[06-Aug-19 09:07 PM] dan.#2473
medium whale just sold a bunch tho

[06-Aug-19 09:07 PM] dan.#2473
200k or so

[06-Aug-19 09:08 PM] Neko#5830
looks like the orderbook is being sold

[06-Aug-19 09:08 PM] dan.#2473
market sells?

[06-Aug-19 09:09 PM] Neko#5830
its about half of what it was a few weeks ago

[06-Aug-19 09:09 PM] dan.#2473
seemed like a market sell of 200k kmd over 6 minutes

[06-Aug-19 09:10 PM] dan.#2473
few more of those bad boys and im back in the game

[06-Aug-19 09:11 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Hey what do you mean the Horizen discord banned you for mentioning Pirate? @actionslacks

[06-Aug-19 09:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
80k dollars was sold

[06-Aug-19 09:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Because btc rekt now

[06-Aug-19 09:12 PM] Neko#5830
when there is no one else left to sell

[06-Aug-19 09:12 PM] Neko#5830
then we rise

[06-Aug-19 09:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
in a couple of months alts will be so low the traders will start salivating and get back in

[06-Aug-19 09:14 PM] dan.#2473
there will be a bottom for good alts

[06-Aug-19 09:14 PM] nocturnal#2177
but btc pwns the crypto capital for the immediate term

[06-Aug-19 09:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Look for weekly bottom

[06-Aug-19 09:15 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Traders usually don‚Äôt salivate over assets that don‚Äôt show relative strength.

[06-Aug-19 09:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
And allin if you want alts

[06-Aug-19 09:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
find the bottom and short it üòÇ:

[06-Aug-19 09:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@washparkdlt that's why 90 loose

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] washparkdlt#6482
It will take sustained relative strength against btc for any traders to be interested

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
90 %

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Sure

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@nocturnal hahah

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] washparkdlt#6482
But that‚Äôs more like ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù

[06-Aug-19 09:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
at some point ppl start getting gready with dreams of 100x etc when prices get very low

[06-Aug-19 09:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
plus btc dominance been on parabolic rise

[06-Aug-19 09:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
at some point things will shift

[06-Aug-19 09:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
although many alts will get culled this cycle i think

[06-Aug-19 09:19 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I think btc dominance may rise to 72-82% leading up to halv before an alt season late 2020/21. Might be a slog here

[06-Aug-19 09:19 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Wish it weren‚Äôt so

[06-Aug-19 09:19 PM] nocturnal#2177
sounds plausible to me

[06-Aug-19 09:20 PM] nocturnal#2177
but might not be as bad as that, who knows

[06-Aug-19 09:20 PM] washparkdlt#6482
In $ terms maybe

[06-Aug-19 09:20 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Against btc may be ugly

[06-Aug-19 09:21 PM] washparkdlt#6482
But who knows

[06-Aug-19 09:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah it will be good for the market ultimately

[06-Aug-19 09:21 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Any partnerships on the horizon?

[06-Aug-19 09:21 PM] nocturnal#2177
the amount of shitcoins is embarrassing for the space

[06-Aug-19 09:21 PM] washparkdlt#6482
So many

[06-Aug-19 09:23 PM] washparkdlt#6482
The market doesn‚Äôt seem to care about tech yet. More partnerships and usability

[06-Aug-19 09:23 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah no ones is using dapps etc which is a shame

[06-Aug-19 09:23 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Right

[06-Aug-19 09:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
but it still feels like its the next step in the road to global intergration after the internet
