Again btc go up..kmd down ...i will never understand this logic

[23-Apr-19 05:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
btc goes up people sell KMD to ride the btc wave
btc goes down people sell KMD to buy USDT
at least thats my idea how it works

[23-Apr-19 05:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Sideways is when you buy alts

[23-Apr-19 05:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
there is no logic- just impulsive action

[23-Apr-19 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Again btc go up..kmd down ...i will never understand this logic`
Because BTC is a god and KMD and other "alts" are an *alternative* to god BTC
It's literally in the language that people like @mrtzmp3 use

[23-Apr-19 06:11 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
People like mrtzmp3 what

[23-Apr-19 06:12 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Apr-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
its one think to talk about it, another to panic when fiat price is stable and BTC price is dropping less than the average

[23-Apr-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
let us try to be a bit more logical and a bit less emotional

[23-Apr-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
unless buy high, sell low is your goal

[23-Apr-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
then its ok to continue with all the emotion based stuff

[23-Apr-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```People like mrtzmp3 what

Whats yout point```
The phraseology of "alts" puts BTC above everything else

[23-Apr-19 06:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Hmmmm

[23-Apr-19 06:16 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No Panic at all here

`its a widely accepted term`
Yes, because it's a widely accepted concept that goes with the word and it's the answer to her question (my personal feelings have nothing to do with it)

P.S. - If you want a word that *actually* pisses me off: 'literally' (when used as its own antonym)

[23-Apr-19 06:21 PM] jl777c#5810
