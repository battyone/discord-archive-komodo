intuitively stayed away from projects promoted by "big finance" guys like Reggie. Veritaseum was shady from the beginning.

[14-Aug-19 08:17 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 08:18 AM] Tek#5253

@polycryptoblog well air drops of new tokens were not working, buybacks not working so now start the printing presses?

[14-Aug-19 08:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So instead of the Waves Community Token, there will be what? a new Waves Staking Token?

[14-Aug-19 08:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now if they print more waves does he not realize that by printing more, the fact that you are gaining more, what you hold is dropping just as fast which has a net effect of 0, but would be negative for the people not staking.

[14-Aug-19 08:59 AM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Tek#5253
adoption is adoption

[14-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Tek#5253
no one will ever pay a parking ticket with BTC cause fees and slow

[14-Aug-19 09:00 AM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253
maybe not in my liftime

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253
but happen it will

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
Maybe in countries like similar to Venezuela but try that in the US or Europe, cant see it happening.

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253
there's many countries that have inflation problems

[14-Aug-19 09:01 AM] Tek#5253
argentina, turkey

[14-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Tek#5253
countries in africa

[14-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Markus#5464
Yes but they would never allow a foreign currency to take over

[14-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Tek#5253
bro if your national currency turns worthless because the elite rulers in the USA ( all national currencies are rules from the usa) decided so

[14-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Markus#5464
Africa yea probably

[14-Aug-19 09:02 AM] Tek#5253
yes they will eventaully stop using national currencies

[14-Aug-19 09:03 AM] Tek#5253
iran is another great example

[14-Aug-19 09:04 AM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 09:04 AM] Tek#5253
keep your realities to yourself

[14-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Markus#5464
I mean up to u what u believe will happen

[14-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Markus#5464
but i dont have same view

[14-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Tek#5253
I know how the current finanical system works

[14-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Tek#5253
and its not pretty

[14-Aug-19 09:05 AM] Markus#5464
I know also but i dont see them giving up their money supply control without a fight

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
they wont give up control. they already control crypto too

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
its about the middle men that are going to change

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
the fairly rich

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
but not the top

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
those will lose their wealth

[14-Aug-19 09:06 AM] Tek#5253
unless they have crypto that is

[14-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Tek#5253
for everyone that's poorcrypto is just an opportunity to earn shekels that don't lose value, from the start

[14-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Markus#5464
Then again it depend on what crypto will succeed, im not sure if any of the existing once will be it

[14-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Tek#5253
doesn't matter which one will be the ruler. as long as you are in the better system you win

[14-Aug-19 09:08 AM] Markus#5464
Enough that central banks make a global currency and average joe will use it then rest of crypto wont see adoption

[14-Aug-19 09:08 AM] Tek#5253
my dads brother is filthy rich in fiat but he doesn't understand inflation and how he's being robbed by holding fiat

[14-Aug-19 09:08 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
to a new generation

[14-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Tek#5253
a new system

[14-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
my boomer dads brother still thinks crypto is going to 0 because of his stocks propaganda he reads

[14-Aug-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
