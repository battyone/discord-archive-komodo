Verus Votes plz.   Do it now!

Why KMD looking sad today? When moon?

[05-Nov-18 05:52 PM] Acura#2748
@Vertigo Usually around 5:40pm each night you can see the moon in the sky - just look up.

[05-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Markus#5464
I think KMD need some serious marketing to get it growing....volume is way too low, hardly believe coinbase will list a coin with no volume doesnt rly benefit them

[05-Nov-18 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd 2.0 rebrand will be finished by december I believe?

[05-Nov-18 07:00 PM] Sdunbar#5064
yeah volume on this coin has almost consistently been one of the lowest of the top 100 coins by market cap

[05-Nov-18 07:01 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I think it's still actually unheard of by many  many people in the cryptosphere

[05-Nov-18 07:55 PM] ryman112#0068
Yes and that is a big problem

[05-Nov-18 07:55 PM] jl777c#5810
why cant the community help spread the word?

[05-Nov-18 08:10 PM] Alice#9607
Lets unleash the tweet storm, the email tsunami, and the facebook flash mob!

[05-Nov-18 08:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm doing my best on socials but most eyes are always on ethereum. But I feel the tide will change within 2019, Komodo will win by sheer superiority even if it needs to do 2x better for 1/2 the recognition

[05-Nov-18 08:23 PM] crumb#2550
i fully understand that vast majority of crypto media is pay-for-play, but we need some kind of 'authority' sources to confirm that what Komodo team has done, is actually top-notch stuff. 

otherwise now matter how much the community members try to mention Komodo on different channels, the answer seems to be:
Komodo? never heard or read about anything about them. so probably nothing really going on there...

wrong statements, but unfortunately this kind of dialogue happens often

[05-Nov-18 08:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess china govt is not authority enough...

[05-Nov-18 08:26 PM] crumb#2550
also a lot of developers form other projects fail to recognise the achievements. i remember a twitter conversation about Verus solving the nothing-at-stake problem and Vlad Zamfir flat out denied to comment

[05-Nov-18 08:26 PM] crumb#2550
actually he said something like: not going to promote your sh#t token

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] crumb#2550
yeah, the china thing is a good start

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] crumb#2550
but very few have picked up on it

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CZ from binance knows about komodo, had good things to say

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] crumb#2550
i was just about to say that

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
many that do the deep research know, but of course only a small percentage do any research

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] crumb#2550
he had some good words

[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and consider reading a tweet as research

[05-Nov-18 08:29 PM] crumb#2550
i remember reading through the *whole* bitcointalk komodo thread, before deciding to join

[05-Nov-18 08:30 PM] crumb#2550
took some time, but turned out some of best time spent. that was spring 2016

[05-Nov-18 08:31 PM] crumb#2550
so yeah, my definition of research differs from most, when they claim they have researched something

[05-Nov-18 08:32 PM] crumb#2550
sorry, i thing it was spring 2017

[05-Nov-18 08:32 PM] crumb#2550
think

[05-Nov-18 08:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's hard to do research but in the end the proof will be in the pudding, once Komodo scales and offers many real world use cases, that will set a new bar that only a few wll be able to match

[05-Nov-18 08:34 PM] crumb#2550
i'm patient, but as the bear market starts to fade all the moonkids come out again

[05-Nov-18 08:34 PM] crumb#2550
demanding marketing

[05-Nov-18 08:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Rebranding will help with the message

[05-Nov-18 08:37 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
and I've said before,  IMO bear market doesn't help improving the crypto market, old shitcoins and hype get just  replaced by new shitcoins and hype. Only scaling with real world use will make a difference

[05-Nov-18 08:47 PM] modereck#4269
How can rebranding help people to know more about the project?

[05-Nov-18 08:48 PM] modereck#4269
thats the problem

[05-Nov-18 08:49 PM] crumb#2550
the rebranding includes clear distinctions and descriptions about all the different components of komodo ecosystem tech

[05-Nov-18 08:49 PM] crumb#2550
dex. jumbler, dpow etc

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
because rebranding includes a new website witih well defined messages and sources catering for developers, businesses and users

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] jansako#3330
The marketing question is a funny one... In a bear market people say: Why do marketing in bear market, let's wait for bull! In bull market, everything is rising, often people in charge do not feel the need for marketing because the price is going up. I am aware of there being a lot of effort expended on the rebranding, so this is in no way a criticism towards the KMD team!

[05-Nov-18 08:50 PM] crumb#2550
it's much more than just a new website and logo

[05-Nov-18 08:51 PM] crumb#2550
most people just think there is new logo coming

[05-Nov-18 08:51 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
exactly, now it's hard to understand what Komodo is about from a quick view and sources are sparse, it needs an effective guide and message for different categories

[05-Nov-18 08:51 PM] crumb#2550
the price movement is not the goal

[05-Nov-18 08:52 PM] Vertigo#0439
I think if we name 1 kmd satoshi a Gecko everyone is just going to say hey how cute I want in!

[05-Nov-18 08:52 PM] crumb#2550
it's about being clear what's been done here

[05-Nov-18 08:52 PM] jansako#3330
indeed. price movement would be a consequence of increased use

[05-Nov-18 08:53 PM] Vertigo#0439
That's all I got

[05-Nov-18 08:55 PM] Lieutenant#1428
Want the whole crypto world to talk about kmd ? go to top 20 coinmarketcap.

[05-Nov-18 08:56 PM] crumb#2550
bitconnect was in top20 :abusedsmily:

[05-Nov-18 08:56 PM] Lieutenant#1428
It is better than any rebranding.

[05-Nov-18 08:56 PM] jansako#3330
putting the horse before the cart methinks

[05-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jansako#3330
but there is the question of what is easier

[05-Nov-18 08:57 PM] jansako#3330
or more desirable to begin with

[05-Nov-18 08:57 PM] crumb#2550
yeah, pushing the price is probably the bad way to go about things

[05-Nov-18 08:58 PM] Lieutenant#1428
bitconnect ponzi - It is not comparable

[05-Nov-18 08:58 PM] crumb#2550
you can't sustain artificially hyped price levels

[05-Nov-18 09:00 PM] crumb#2550
i haven't made a single tweet mentioning komodo price

[05-Nov-18 09:01 PM] crumb#2550
i avoid talking about token prices. it's secondary

[05-Nov-18 09:01 PM] crumb#2550
tech and adoption are vastly more important

[05-Nov-18 09:01 PM] crumb#2550
awareness about Komodo needs to help adoption, not to hype price

[05-Nov-18 09:06 PM] jansako#3330
My number one trouble with crypto in general is that I am having trouble finding people that 'need' it. I work in a software dev company, even for us I am not able to find a clear use case where I could tell the owner something like: we should use blockchain tech to solve this business problem. I know he would jump on it, but so far I have been always able to find a 'better' (faster/simpler/less expensive)  approach, so we never needed it. TBH the 'I need to be safe from government/USD collapses tomorrow etc' stuff is just BS for most of businesses and especially the genpop out there

[05-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jansako#3330
Sure, IF the worst ever happens, the fringe will be vindicated but one should not build one's business model on the apocalypse incoming (unless one is selling survival equipment) üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Having money under your total control, accepted worldwide and sent in seconds, and market-driven instead of political, that is itself a great use case

[05-Nov-18 09:09 PM] jansako#3330
In theory yes, in practice?

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I do use it in practice! And really love it

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
then there's tokenization of securities and real world things

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] crumb#2550
it will take time

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] jansako#3330
You CAN use it, you do not NEED it

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] jansako#3330
ther is the difference

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
ask in Venezuela if the they need it...

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] crumb#2550
but central bankers are inflating their way out of overspending all over the world

[05-Nov-18 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`My number one trouble with crypto in general is that I am having trouble finding people that 'need' it.....should use blockchain tech to solve this business problem. `
Perhaps don't fall into the trap of conflating crypto and blockchain?

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] jansako#3330
do they? just ask Maduro...

[05-Nov-18 09:11 PM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ agree.

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] crumb#2550
it's highly likely that really good use cases come from places we can't imagine yet

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it can be hyped for uses that are not well suited or really needed, but the good uses are there

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] crumb#2550
who could imagine facebook in 1998

[05-Nov-18 09:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
don't feel forced to use it, in most cases your business doesn't need it

[05-Nov-18 09:13 PM] jansako#3330
yes, therein lies the main marketing hurdle (for me)

[05-Nov-18 09:14 PM] crumb#2550
there was a pretty sensible article in Coindesk couple of days ago from a guy working for big four auditor EY. his main message was that even if it solves problems, it still too much hassle to change the existing systems that are already in place

[05-Nov-18 09:15 PM] jansako#3330
It must solve problems 'better' (faster, cheaper, easier) than the existing methods.

[05-Nov-18 09:15 PM] crumb#2550
not just better, but orders of magnitude better. to overcome the inertia

[05-Nov-18 09:16 PM] jansako#3330
The bigger the difference, the faster the adoption, but 'just enough better' is good, over time

[05-Nov-18 09:18 PM] crumb#2550
it is very different for different industries/companies. the bigger the company, the harder it is to overcome inertia

[05-Nov-18 09:20 PM] jansako#3330
You are right, but that can be solved by leveraging early adopters etc. To circle this back around, with KMD 2.0 I would love to see a focus on solutions for real 'business pain'. @KomodoWorld , if you are still listening and in case you guys are gathering feedback. üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Things like tokenization of securities or the Mattereum project need intelligent legislation that supports and doesn't block such uses

[05-Nov-18 09:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
otherwise there will remain a fringe

[05-Nov-18 09:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
countries are different, there are friendly ones and other less so

[05-Nov-18 09:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it will take a couple of decades IMO

[05-Nov-18 09:24 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
to see sizable effects on many aspects of life

[05-Nov-18 09:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
personally I'm more in the political fringe, so I want use this tech to help local secessions bypassing existing censorable methods of organization, trading and exchange üòÉ

[05-Nov-18 09:27 PM] crumb#2550
if the answer to all economic troubles is just turn the money printing into high gear. then crypto as money or means of payment might become a reality sooner than we think

[05-Nov-18 10:57 PM] ryman112#0068
So if someone where to say Google Komodo and that's what most would do what would they find?

[05-Nov-18 11:02 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
nobody just randomly googles komodo

[05-Nov-18 11:03 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it doesn't work to google the coin name for like 95% of the coins

[05-Nov-18 11:04 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
you always search for *yourcryptohere*+coin or *yourcryptohere*+crypto or *yourcryptohere*+bitz¬¥coin

[05-Nov-18 11:04 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
at this point you do get the correct results

[05-Nov-18 11:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i believe the problem would be more how to get ppl to even google for komodo in the first place

[05-Nov-18 11:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
i got here through word of mouth from another trader

[05-Nov-18 11:06 PM] ryman112#0068
We are talking about people who don't know shit.  Not people already aware
