That‚Äôs what KMD does

[23-Aug-18 01:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have some indications about it not being a triangle, it being a ending diagonal. Although it cant yet be certain.

[23-Aug-18 01:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is the bad thing about triangles. You only know where they will go when they break.

[23-Aug-18 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as long as the team members keep being selfish assholes that do their job and push out great tech

[23-Aug-18 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd will dump

thx @siu - Chainmakers srsly

[23-Aug-18 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the fisrt smart contracts ever deployed in a utxo chain are almost ready

[23-Aug-18 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but, then we will need a gui for each contract.

[23-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Has the code for full CC already been forked into KMD?

[23-Aug-18 01:47 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Looking around.. crypto's still bleeding like shiiiiit

[23-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is the CC spoken of still only on the test chains utilizing them?

[23-Aug-18 01:49 PM] xRobeSx#5136
its in Komodo codebase @Hollowman9000 but only enabled for assetchains, not KMD yet afaik

[23-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[23-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
When does the once a month reward claiming requirement kick in?

[23-Aug-18 01:50 PM] xRobeSx#5136

[23-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Letting heat lease away, it loses value faster than is gained via forge rewards though :abusedsmily:

September 30th next ETF decision

[23-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe the markets will wake up in the runup to the date

[23-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As far as I can tell that one has the biggest shot of being approved

[23-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Until then it‚Äôll just more margin traders getting busted on bitmex

[23-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[23-Aug-18 02:16 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
@Cryptoon The next ETF decision is Sept. 7th

[23-Aug-18 02:17 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
-Sept. 7th: Bitwise ETF First Deadline 
3 possible outcomes: approved, denied, or delayed

[23-Aug-18 02:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[23-Aug-18 02:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ETF is s mainstream news manipulation thing.
Stupid thing isn‚Äôt useful to small traders like me who doesn‚Äôt have anything in stock market.

ETF is incremental for going mainstream IMO

[23-Aug-18 02:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
but we are not there yet

[23-Aug-18 02:35 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
i think they will deny all of them, it's to risky for the SEC to approve it atm

[23-Aug-18 02:35 PM] WhiteWidow#8771

Any crazy predictions for it? üòÅüòÖ

[23-Aug-18 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007

[23-Aug-18 02:58 PM] snowdamn#2414

How does the assets work? Every time 1m is reached its paid out?

[23-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there a way to see how close to the mil is

[23-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
And would we not be able to buy it right before the 1m? Or is it paid out only if you hold for whole duration?

[23-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hows it work exactly :o

[23-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There are adresses where you can see how much has been accumulated I think

[23-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Paid out to holders at time of payout

[23-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or are people smart and price reflects it aka drops right after payout

[23-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or are payouts too tiny for people to bother atm

[23-Aug-18 03:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I assume because more people are buying price will go up and return on investment will be lower

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1M usd paid out over 1M DEX is 1 usd per dex

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Interesting :yassinkomodo:

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
At current prices that is +-11% return

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(I think supply of DEX was 1M, not sure)

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] Yassin#3685
1M

[23-Aug-18 03:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
I expect the supernet payout to be at approx 0.16 kmd per supernet

[23-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sort of want passive kmd

[23-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sort of dont want to risk trading away kmd

[23-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
üòÇ

[23-Aug-18 03:14 PM] CHMEX#0686
For crypto maybe around 0.23kmd / crypto

[23-Aug-18 03:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
And revs approx 0.01kmd/revs

[23-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX?

[23-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I looked into it a while back and thought DEX/Jumblr were the best to buy now speculating on an increase in usage of both platforms

[23-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And now DEX is 50% cheaper so yea :p

[23-Aug-18 03:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Buy buy buy

[23-Aug-18 03:26 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
was there any distrib of fee to DEX assets yet ? By far I remember there was only Supernet and tha other one like 5% sth

[23-Aug-18 03:28 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
DEX value depends on DEX usage, which depends strongly on DEX promotion/marketing. Same story as in CEX - if you want more profit you need to fight for attraction.

[23-Aug-18 03:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
Anyone here use cryptobridge dex?
