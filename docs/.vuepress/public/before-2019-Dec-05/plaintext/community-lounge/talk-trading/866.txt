silly man hours went into it. I personally spent multip;e hundreds of hours on it and only started working on them a few months ago

[27-Jun-19 03:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
barterdex was completely unprecedented. i'm more interested in who the competition will be. likely no one for some time because no one else has managed to pull it off

[27-Jun-19 03:55 AM] richardt#2807
apparently atomicdex is much better in terms of usability and reliability

[27-Jun-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its mobile only, so just that itself make it easy to use. Personally I think without a desktop app or something to make bobs eaier to run it will still lack liqidity but who knows.

[27-Jun-19 03:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main issue was that the thing was too hard to use,, that seems to have been solved

[27-Jun-19 03:57 AM] richardt#2807
hard to use, unreliable, and no liquidity

[27-Jun-19 03:58 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôll make bobs again and provide liquidity. I had to step away for a while; but if bobs can run reliably and trade, liquidity won‚Äôt be a problem for the the main coins

[27-Jun-19 04:00 AM] actionslacks#4072
well all jumped in, figured it out and set an atomic swap record. the same will happen again. i have little doubt

kmd is like that kid in school who always gets picked on, but then everyone cheats off of his homework.

why is the digitalprice price for ARRR  higher than coinmarketcap rates?

[27-Jun-19 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
real price is higher, the CMC exchanges are having issues with the wallets, so the price becomes lower

[27-Jun-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
cryprobridge hasnt sent withdraws in a month, people are reluctant to buy ARRR there

[27-Jun-19 06:36 AM] rainbro7#4735
Whats the next big coin JL777 , it was awesome watching you past picks (stratis, SYS). Ya gotta have some new picks?

@jl777c seems like tron is doing a 20M buyback of TRX on the open market over 1 year.

[27-Jun-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can you announce that you are doing a 1 B buy back of Komodo over the next 500 years? Im sure that will pump the price üòÑ

[27-Jun-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@rainbro7 before it used to be not so hard to find the good ROI potentials, find good devs in a project that is raising relatively small amounts. nowadays, almost all decent projects are getting tens or hundreds of millions, making the upside limited. add in the risk factor and not much makes me want to invest. for now i am picking mostly ecosystem projects that are without any big ICO/funding, but with a good potential. so yes, the PIRATE, VRSC, CHIPS and I have been converting the other coins to KMD for this bull run

[27-Jun-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, it is a big paper loss, but i dont plan to sell any time soon. the rewards alone will be able to fund things for 12 years

[27-Jun-19 07:33 AM] Trent R.#5556

I‚Äôve been looking into downloading the wallet, haven‚Äôt had the time to with work lately.

[27-Jun-19 07:34 AM] Trent R.#5556
Been invested in kmd for over a year now. The progress and updates you guys have been releasing are tremendous.

[27-Jun-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the time to sell altcoins is when BTC dominance is making new lows, when it is making new highs is the absolute worst time to sell

[27-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Trent R.#5556
Agreed. The bitcoin pump we‚Äôve had over the last month has just been confirmation of a bull market. It‚Äôs a cycle and alts are always involved. Just have to be patient

[27-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a two stroke engine, the BTC dominance increases the overall marketcap for the next stroke that pulls it into altcoins

[27-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Trent R.#5556
Will the rebranding have any effect on KMD itself? Like will you be creating a separate project and moving away from the KMD currency?

[27-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so as painful it might be to look at the satoshi prices, this is worlds better than if BTC was making new lows and sats were double the price

[27-Jun-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is here to stay

[27-Jun-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
rebranding wont change that, the name stays too

[27-Jun-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
also antara is not a separate coin/project, it is the name for all the new tech

[27-Jun-19 07:37 AM] Trent R.#5556
Yes. I read all about Antara. Showed evolve.komodo to a few of the developers that i work with

[27-Jun-19 07:38 AM] Trent R.#5556
The UI design alone would take devs weeks to design

[27-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Trent R.#5556
The only part i was confused about was rebranding, couldn‚Äôt find enough information regarding what would happen/effect the KMD currency itself

[27-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Trent R.#5556
When one sees rebranding in the crypto market it scares investors. Making them think they are starting over/ doing something completely different. Meaning that their past work is no longer going to be needed

[27-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Mark81#4505
I think this komodo rebranding is really rebranding insense of what that word means. It's about making brand that you connect into name komodo by from just visual outlook.

LUMBER connects with ppl on a viseral level. My first-grade teacher used to have a yardstick aptly named "Dr. Wood". He cured all ills, real and imagined. :troll_thuglife:

[27-Jun-19 08:07 AM] gcharang#6833
@Trent R. in the beginning, KMD was a zcash clone(privacy) protected by bitcoin's hashrate (security)

 Now it has so much more
- smartchains with customizable parameters 
- custom consensus modules
....

rebrand is to bring the new features into the image of what Komodo is

@jl777c so what does actually a rebrand here means, if we actually dont rebrand it?

[27-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean how are we change the image of kmd to ppl

[27-Jun-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
rebrand != rename

[27-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Caglio#3337
but we wont change the name ?

[27-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Markus#5464
by giving it a refresh and updated view

[27-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337
so komodo stays komodo, but its rebranded, so I ask how, how will ppl even know we rebranded anything

[27-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337
but most of the ppl dont even know about us markus

[27-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Caglio#3337

@blackjok3r that could work

[27-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
a average joe will never understand what exactly kmd tech is doing... and when u explain they will be like thats complicated but yet they will have a little more understanding

[27-Jun-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
It is a market strategy of giving a new name, symbol, or change in design for an already-established brand. The idea behind rebranding is to create a different identity for a brand, from its competitors, in the market.

[27-Jun-19 09:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
As afar as I'm aware there are many working products

[27-Jun-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
most people still think KMD is just a zcash clone

[27-Jun-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
reality is far different

[27-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Caglio#3337

antara is the name for all the CC, smartchains, etc. a single name for all the complex tech.

[27-Jun-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the aim is to reduce the 1/tech effect by making all the tech map to a single "antara"

[27-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jansako#3330
Why don;t we just call it a PR push or Promo/Marketing campaign? Since it is not really a rebranding, more of a 'increase brand awareness' with many new PR vehicles employed?

[27-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
new visual identity, website, messaging, ...

[27-Jun-19 09:07 AM] jansako#3330

[27-Jun-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it is "rebranding" -> "or change in design for an already-established brand."

[27-Jun-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
design and messaging being changed

[27-Jun-19 09:08 AM] jansako#3330
Seems people confuse rebranding with a rename, or expect the latter as a part of former?

[27-Jun-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
1/rebranding!

[27-Jun-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i am told this is a rebranding, seems best to stick with it as it also fits the definition

[27-Jun-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the people that are expecting just a name change, would then be surprised

[27-Jun-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, something that will make it very clear komodo is not just a zcash clone
