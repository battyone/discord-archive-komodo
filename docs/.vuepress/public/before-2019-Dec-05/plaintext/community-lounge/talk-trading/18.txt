Sweet üëå Ride that wave!

[23-Jun-18 02:13 PM] RAE#3178
So many different opinions about BTC atm. I'm gleaning most are bearish for a breakdown to low 5k.

[23-Jun-18 02:18 PM] RAE#3178
Any ideas for the volume atm?

[23-Jun-18 02:18 PM] RAE#3178
KMD volume that is

[23-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
