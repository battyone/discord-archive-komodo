500$ stop hunt, market manipulation at its finest

[12-May-19 11:58 AM] Markus#5464
only in crypto üòÑ

[12-May-19 11:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what you mean by market manipulation?

[12-May-19 11:58 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what would not manipulated market be?

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this confuses me a lot.

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
so if there is 70% longs

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
and market drop 500$

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
its not obvious bitfinex and bitmex market manipulating?

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
ok

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what about the stop hunt on the way to $7.5k, wasnt that manipulation then?

[12-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
it was

[12-May-19 12:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then its not manipulation

[12-May-19 12:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if its up and down, then its just market being the market

[12-May-19 12:00 PM] Markus#5464
i have different view xD

[12-May-19 12:01 PM] Markus#5464
but i dont complain

[12-May-19 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
everyone tries to manipulate the market

[12-May-19 12:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that becomes a non manipulation because when everyone is trying to do the same it gets nulled.

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
lets take 4.2k as example

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
it broke

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
500 mil got liquidated

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
if it instead was 500 mil longs

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
it would most likely go down

[12-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
in other way bitmex would get bankrupt

[12-May-19 12:04 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
?

[12-May-19 12:04 PM] Markus#5464
doubt they could pay the 500 mil longs with leverage

[12-May-19 12:04 PM] Markus#5464
with a 1k candle

[12-May-19 12:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the closed short pumps the price, the opened long gets the momentum of that pump.

[12-May-19 12:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That's if it is 50/50 split right though? If say there is 80% longs vs 20% short, the 30% shortfall here comes out of Bitmex as you are counter trading them essentially

[12-May-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It would be a margin call

[12-May-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the loss is not taken by the house, its taken by the user

[12-May-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If there is 4B worth of longs and 1B short, if the longs win how will the short cover?

[12-May-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is loss taken by the house, thus the loss fund they have.

[12-May-19 12:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In case they get someone who cant cover a margin call

[12-May-19 12:29 PM] Markus#5464
this is exactly what i was talking about

[12-May-19 12:30 PM] Markus#5464
this is why they manipulate price opposite direction

[12-May-19 12:30 PM] Markus#5464
cause they cant cover it

[12-May-19 12:30 PM] Markus#5464
obviously its not individual ppl pushing the price opposite direction

[12-May-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but they are not the only exchange

[12-May-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and they can manipulate price in their exchange but cant manipulate the whole market

[12-May-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hence they become just another player

[12-May-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a big one

[12-May-19 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and yes, im not discarting manipulative attempts.

[12-May-19 12:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But even then, not all tries are assured to be won

[12-May-19 12:36 PM] Markus#5464
shouldnt forget that Tether is stable coin by Bitfinex

[12-May-19 12:36 PM] Markus#5464
and its traded on most exchanges

[12-May-19 12:37 PM] Markus#5464
so they can pretty easily sync trades between multiple large exchanges

[12-May-19 12:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
true

[12-May-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
where does kmd signs up for that??? :troll:

[12-May-19 12:40 PM] Markus#5464
get usd pairs

[12-May-19 12:40 PM] Markus#5464
it sux that kmd doesnt have usd pair on binance

[12-May-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
USDT*

[12-May-19 01:02 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
why there isnt hype around kmd? cosmos out of nowhere came and every one talks about it

[12-May-19 01:09 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Deleted User you say cosmos better developed than kmd?? kmd team saying that they solved scalibility and they are so fast but i dont see hype around it and no one talks about it. if eth did that now it would all around the internet

[12-May-19 01:12 PM] p.#1126
Eth doesn't need to exist

[12-May-19 01:13 PM] Tek#5253
cosmos isn't exactly new and they didn't come out of no where

[12-May-19 01:13 PM] Tek#5253
in 2017 people wer already talking about cosmos

üëç 

[12-May-19 01:14 PM] Tek#5253
also cosmos ico investors are up 40x or more and they get their funds unlocked in ~ T-2weeks

[12-May-19 01:14 PM] Tek#5253
so expect a dump

[12-May-19 01:17 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Deleted User formal??  why it is a big problem?

[12-May-19 01:19 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Deleted User aha i hear you. about komodo succeses , why their fast blockchain not hyped like the other teams .the teams that just talk and not have a soloution yet

[12-May-19 01:24 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@Deleted User tnx for explaining it. cosmos implemented multi chain assets . isnt that right?? how kmd can deal with his rivals

[12-May-19 01:28 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
yeah you are right. tnx for answering. when you should think kmd would have big announcement about  project prgress?

[12-May-19 01:28 PM] CoinKing88#1540

To be honest, if you follow dev channels here, there are "big announcements" just about every week. They happen so often and so quickly they often go unnoticed other than a mention in a Tech Tuesday

[12-May-19 01:39 PM] Alright#0419
or some tweets from "IBM" ü§£

[12-May-19 01:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Any plans on rewarding people to come build on Komodo or like a once off outreach? Some dev support:free dPoW for a year for top project idea proposal? üò¨ Willing to fund half the dpow

[12-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Check out #kmdlabs @Crabby Paddy

[12-May-19 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
there are a few people who have said they will fund dpow costs for any community projects that seem worthy

[12-May-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I‚Äôm sure Alright can explain it 100x better then me

It's easier to become anonymous than to prove your identity to someone. Especially when this someone is unknown.
