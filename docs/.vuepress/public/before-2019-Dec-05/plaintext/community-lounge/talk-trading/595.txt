Paint a H&S and then go in balls deep with no lube on the shorts that piled up

[02-May-19 03:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now that everyone is longing?

@Markus hows that leveraged short working out for you? the $5500 you said wouldnt happen, happened

[02-May-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
didnt mention anything about 5500, and even if we dont count the premium on finex, prices are 5400 everywhere else ðŸ‘Œ

[02-May-19 04:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last candle on blockfolio looks interesting though

[02-May-19 04:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
seems bittrex touched 5500 and then pushed back to 5430

@Markus there is an imposter pretending to be you!

you just about guaranteed that the TA said it cant go above 5.5k

[02-May-19 04:25 PM] Markus#5464
5422 high on coinbase, 50 weekly ma 5460 :troll_lol:

[02-May-19 04:26 PM] Markus#5464
so plan is valid

[02-May-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you will open the 100x short today?

[02-May-19 04:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
One of those TA guys. "sure it went up 10 percent but it didn't reach the exact point I said it would so therefore I'm right. Continue to short as planned."

[02-May-19 04:28 PM] Markus#5464
either way im no expert in TA i just learn by doing and give out my personal opinion about what i think will happen. Thats no financial advice and nobody should trade based on my charts unless they believe its the right thing to do

[02-May-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
wow, thats a lot less sure than before. I thought TA could predict exact timing and everything

[02-May-19 04:34 PM] Markus#5464
Idk why ur trolling i thought this is a trading channel but it turned lately into a general talk channel and whenever any trading topic starts then ppl literally bash this ppl for trying to stick to what the channel was meant for

[02-May-19 04:36 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm all for posting TAs in this channel because if it represents the same as the other TAs on tradingview, then I know to do the opposite.

[02-May-19 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I was wondering

[02-May-19 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if you long/short something 100x

[02-May-19 04:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If it goes the other way more than 1% you get liquidated right?

[02-May-19 04:38 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[02-May-19 04:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or if you just hold more in your acct the position stays open?

[02-May-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464
I think not

[02-May-19 04:39 PM] Markus#5464
maybe it depend of contract type i think there is different kind of contracts

[02-May-19 04:40 PM] Markus#5464
i dont do bitmex

[02-May-19 04:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
me neither, just wondered

In some cases, the shorter balance is not enough. In few cases the lost was put on all shorters. There were 2 or 3 stories like this in crypto

[02-May-19 04:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why would one then even go 100x leverage, I mean in times of extreme volatility 1% is nothing

[02-May-19 04:43 PM] jl777c#5810
my only issue with the TA peoples is their position that it is the "bible" and that nothing else matters and that it works perfect

[02-May-19 04:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So you get liquidated in the blink of an eye, and if you have a bad internet connection one sec and you are fucked

[02-May-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
which is implicit in statements like "xyz price cant happen because of TA factors abc..."

[02-May-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
ofc everything can happen a good example is when price flew from 4k to 5k, 500 mil got liquidated on bitmex so clearly ppl didnt believe it would break through

[02-May-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
TA is a tool whose efficacy is debatable and it is far from any guarantee as can be evidenced by the reluctance for TA believers to do 100x leverage

[02-May-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
of course 100x leverage is pure insanity for crypto, easier just to send funds directly to the bitmex address

[02-May-19 04:46 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It was a good bet that bitcoin was going to 5k or higher when 95% of all TAs were drawing lines to 1800 or lower.

[02-May-19 04:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

why do we even talk about 100x? ðŸ˜„

> not going 1000x

Too easy. Just watch on what @Hollowman9000 buys then sells shortly after. Buy that and hold it until 1000x gains.
