Iâ€™m somewhat of an expert in absurd thinking

[22-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Markus#5464
Flint is a AI or something? ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] Flint#6435
@Hollowman9000  lots of! but I will try to explain the principle of memorization with a simple example: you probably know that the Mercedes logo means Mercedes and the Toyota logo means Toyota - although there is no hidden information in the logos or a hint in the form of letters - you either know it or not - this is an associative series - on this all learning Chinese is built!

[22-Jun-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the original emoji

[22-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How difficult did you find western alphabet languages to be, having Chinese as a first language @Flint ?

[22-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  yes - like jl 777 - I am an AI from the future - there is a bitcoin of 100k ðŸ¤–

[22-Jun-19 04:07 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I think the KMD ico is still my big winner. Considering I swapped thousands of bitcoindarks that was purchased at 50 cents.

[22-Jun-19 04:08 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
There is only one jll777

[22-Jun-19 04:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
jll777 is earth2 jl777

@Hollowman9000  A special ping yin system is used to study æ‹¼éŸ³ for this

[22-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tried command line

[22-Jun-19 04:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pinging yin keeps timing out

[22-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Flint#6435
and I think that jl777 is Satoshi himself in a new reincarnation!)

[22-Jun-19 04:14 PM] Flint#6435
@Hollowman9000  usually start learning Chinese from this! Well, if you know Chinese and English in China, you can concoct something on a python (or other programming language) - then the Chinese will flood money

Who sell such a big amount to supernet?

[22-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Markus#5464
@Hollowman9000  enough if u check how much Tether printed lately

[22-Jun-19 04:30 PM] Markus#5464

i quess btc pump is on it again

[22-Jun-19 04:52 PM] kaks#6612
I think what btc ia doing now is b-wave, at least should test 21 EMA which is 6k lvl to be healthy bull market

[22-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
crypto market is too manipulated atm so anything can happen, tether keep printing non stop to push price

[22-Jun-19 04:53 PM] kaks#6612
If the test happens we are 100% in bull market

[22-Jun-19 04:54 PM] kaks#6612
What is going high must go down for sure

[22-Jun-19 04:56 PM] kaks#6612
Look at previous bull market and now 
Previous toke 1.5 year to confirm
How this one only in 6 months all saying its a bullmarket and even didnt retest the 21EMA ðŸ˜‚

[22-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Markus#5464
there is alot of red flags but everytime i even mention something negative about the current market state everyone freaks out saying its normal

[22-Jun-19 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I was like that last night

[22-Jun-19 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I had a blast mostly by myself

[22-Jun-19 04:58 PM] kaks#6612
More high is going now is more risky

[22-Jun-19 04:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I got asked why i was so celebrative

[22-Jun-19 04:59 PM] kaks#6612
If i were you i'd sell all btc and wait for the correction ðŸ˜‚

[22-Jun-19 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I said because btc was above $10k and the faces were ðŸ™„

[22-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Markus#5464
its also funny that we just flew by 200 daily ma and never even considered about testing it as support

[22-Jun-19 05:05 PM] kaks#6612
Imo, If we are in bull market btc have to retest this lvl http://imgur.com/hRCLz6j

@jl777c any opinion on images above?ðŸ‘†

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
only the future can answer what will happen for sure

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] Markus#5464
but yes i see ur point and its possible....i dont think this is a bull run, its way too parabolic growth. And i will defend it with Tether printing non stop u can check their market cap and it will talk for itself

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
nearly anything is possible

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
all i know is that if it keeps going up, then the price cant go down that much

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] kaks#6612
I just compared between the previous bullmarket and this one

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
this bull market WONT be like the last one

[22-Jun-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
100% guaranteed

[22-Jun-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this is the first bull where the establishment is vested in crypto

[22-Jun-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
last bull had to be stopped as the "wrong" people (us) had most all the crypto

[22-Jun-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
hence the big bear so they can buy it

[22-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Markus#5464
think so too but we cant deny that a higher low is needed to confirm the bull market

[22-Jun-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
this is the same crowd that makes the stockmarket where it is

[22-Jun-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
a series of higher highs can get to 40k, and you will still say it is some bear market wave and not a confirmed bull?

[22-Jun-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
at some price level, without whatever technical confirmation, it becomes a bull

{Reactions}
ðŸ‘Œ 

[22-Jun-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you are thinking about markets that dont have a drastic change in liquidity

[22-Jun-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
well i dont think its a bear market but better to have confirmation then to get fucked over right ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
then the normal oscillations are in play

[22-Jun-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but if 10x the water is put into the same space, well, what matters about normal harmonic oscilations?

[22-Jun-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if as allbits say, institutional (read trillions of dollars) investors are allocating some percentage to crypto

[22-Jun-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that will translate to an entirely new level of market capitalization and it will indeed make gaps, unconfirmed whatnots and just higher and higher prices

[22-Jun-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
like PIRATE

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it went from 0.03 to 0.18?, probably it broke many TA rules. so it means it will correct back to 0.05 to confirm??

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Flint#6435
in the market of manipulators nothing guarantees testing 21 EMA (

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
when small caps are becoming midcaps, the patterns are broken

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is going from midcap to largecap

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
rules will be broken

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
sorry

[22-Jun-19 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
cant predict the exact path

[22-Jun-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
did the bolivar paint the proper TA patterns?

[22-Jun-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
will it fill in the gaps for when it was actually worth something?

[22-Jun-19 05:14 PM] Markus#5464
There is way too less data when it comes to Pirate to consider real TA and read previous patterns

[22-Jun-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
observe what is happening

[22-Jun-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the best advice

[22-Jun-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be a wild ride, that is an almost sure thing

[22-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Markus#5464
yes for sure it will

[22-Jun-19 05:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
mow much liquidity did tether print?

[22-Jun-19 05:16 PM] designer#4893
If we use stable coin as a hedge of inflation, will that be stable?

[22-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Flint#6435
the pirate is recovering its previous volumes - it may be a short-term illusion as well as the direction of the trend - too little historical data for now - but fundamentally money should be poured in like in one of the digital offshore companies!

[22-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Flint#6435
@designer  good question

[22-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Markus#5464
Tether marketcap went from roughly 1.7 bil to almost 3.6 bil

[22-Jun-19 05:17 PM] Markus#5464
since december

[22-Jun-19 05:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
well there you go. bitfinex scam team must have taken on some new partners

[22-Jun-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus most of that tether is backed by at least something, dont worry

[22-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Flint#6435
@Markus  but you do not forget that this is not fiat money so much bitcoin is gone and transfusions of altcoins with questionable value!

[22-Jun-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
"something" ðŸ˜„ might aswell be backed by dogshit :troll_lol:

[22-Jun-19 05:19 PM] designer#4893
the first concept of fixing prices will be shaken by global villagers who want to keep them as inflation targets for their currencies without exchanging money. making fine adjustments to keep this promise will strangely make the organization resemble the government.

[22-Jun-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it was indeed surprising that after finding out 25% of tether are not backed at all, the price of it didnt change much

[22-Jun-19 05:20 PM] Markus#5464
Pretty sure they just adjusted the value

[22-Jun-19 05:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
maybe because people are used to fractional reserve systems

[22-Jun-19 05:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
75% backed makes it look like gold compared to the dollar

[22-Jun-19 05:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
pirate is new enough that if they want to acquire it they will have to buy it with btc.

[22-Jun-19 05:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
10% backed would make it equivalent to what banks loan out everyday

[22-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Flint#6435
How much REAL money backed up by something other than mining and the price of electricity entered the market capitalization? I believe that ten times less! Â fomo is our enemy
