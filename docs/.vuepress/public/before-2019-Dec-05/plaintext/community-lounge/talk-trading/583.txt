At least this isn't IOTA. That coin only knows one direction and it isn't up. It used to be #4 on CMC.

A quick question -from where a decentralised exchange will pick up the price of BTC

[26-Apr-19 04:50 AM] hastrup#8742
Wtb 500 bots 500 jumblr offer 2k komodo

@bogybogy you place an order and see if someone fills it

[26-Apr-19 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
that is like asking where a CEX will pick up the price of BTC

[26-Apr-19 05:10 AM] Alright#0419
or you see an order and fill it ofc

But guys, when was the Wall St Journal Finex FUD release today? 

5:15pm EST. Then tweeted by the publisher at 5:21 EST. 

Coincidental timing?

is tether about to pop? Anyone actually understand what that thing from NY AG means?

[26-Apr-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
they confiscated $850 million and then accuse tether of being short of funds by $850 mil

[26-Apr-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
which I guess is sort of true

[26-Apr-19 10:49 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lmao

[26-Apr-19 10:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not short of fund they accused them of loosing them right ?

[26-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
"you are bankrupt by $850 million and misleading all the people in new york." 
"no we arent, we have all our funds over in that account"
"we just seized it"

according to this ccn article is says they lost $850M then used tether reserves to try to cover it up

[26-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
ccn is not a good source for these kind of things though

[26-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Alright#0419
I'm just trying to figure out if this means they're insolvent in regards to tether reserves

[26-Apr-19 10:52 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Well at least KMD didnt tank again in sats. We might have hit a bottom.

US government siezed money from a french bank because they we transacting in USD with iran

[26-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
they did lose it when the govt confiscated it

[26-Apr-19 10:52 AM] klein#5233
outside of America

[26-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so they printed tethers to make up the difference

[26-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
seems normal

[26-Apr-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810

these USD stable coins are playing with fire

[26-Apr-19 10:53 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
They minted only 300 million yesterday i think

[26-Apr-19 10:53 AM] klein#5233
do not fuck with them

[26-Apr-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
but only 2% premium for the backed stable coins so the market doesnt seem to care too much

[26-Apr-19 10:54 AM] CoinKing88#1540
the existence of stable coins is based on the hassle with banks/governments not allowing easy USD/EUR pairs.

[26-Apr-19 10:55 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[26-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
is it backed by verifiable crypto reserves?

[26-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont know the details

[26-Apr-19 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
I think KSB is redeemable, could be wrong though

[26-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i talk about a decentralized stablecoin backed by crypto value

[26-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
where users determine when to issue stablecoins by borrowing against their crypto deposit

[26-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and anybody can be a liquidator to liquidate accounts that have too little reserves to be safe

[26-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
for a slice of the gains

[26-Apr-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so the most leveraged get liquidated to remove stable coins from the system to restore balance

tether down to $0.99 if anyone wants to take a risk for 1% profit 😂

[26-Apr-19 10:58 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
If tether was about to collapse , why its still 0.99

[26-Apr-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
all other than overnight 99% drop scenarios appear to be pretty solid. in an overnight 99% loss in the backing crypto, not much can be done other than to socialize the losses
