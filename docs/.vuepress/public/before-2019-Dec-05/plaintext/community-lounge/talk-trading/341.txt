You scripted the removal of the rest of the rewards?  Or do you check daily and remove as they unlock?  Is there a way to merget that WIF to a different wallet ?  ( As if you didn't consider all this before).

[13-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Vertigo#0439
Yawn bought a bit more

[13-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Vertigo#0439
Is like crack or meth

[13-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Vertigo#0439
You buy and you get some awkward number , buy some more to make it a round number. You get some rewards it makes it awkward again.

[13-Dec-18 01:08 AM] Vertigo#0439

Will sapling mean Komodo has double the transaction per second

[13-Dec-18 02:08 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So we achieve 200m?

[13-Dec-18 02:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sapling upgrade includes block size increase, yes. That means a single blockchain transaction amount to double than before.
scaling solution is NOT about single chain, but multiple blockchains working as a group, a cluster, like a 1 single organism??
the way scaling solution works, it is already proven to show over 45,000+ transactions per second.
that demonstration showed how the scaling solution works. It doesn't actually need another demonstration, but it is good for marketing to show such demonstration, as kinda people believe what they see. I don't have update on scaling. Just join #dev-scalability to ask and know more on it.
there is factually no limit to the limit of transactions per second as per the solution provided by Komodo.

What is funny is that everything happened when this right wing...bad people started winning in different countries...the US - Brazil - Italy-  Hungary - Poland -French yellow vest protests...it goes on and on...as the fight with China for technology and patent stealing for Artificial intelligence microchips is brewing.....suddenly they stopped the easy money from the Federal reserve and the stock market crashed....and crypto as well....all is just a coincidence....I bet that if Brexit is done as the people wanted it to be...it would be the last shoe to drop...for the Central Banksters....

[13-Dec-18 07:44 AM] Hermes#6934
Technology is the only fight left...and the patent stealing is not enough to make the artificial intelligence microchips...only one company has the machine that China is looking to copy or steal...to start making their new copies of these microchips...but they haven't been able to get them...because it's of national security so China can't get them till this day ...and that's where we are in the asymmetrical war 5d chess game that is happening.

[13-Dec-18 08:14 AM] wolfgang#3508
so what will the sapling upgrade mean for the price

[13-Dec-18 08:45 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[13-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
dunno but I bought yesterday and I am happy today

[13-Dec-18 09:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Hermes easy money stopped back in 2015.

[13-Dec-18 09:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Rates has been going up since then too.

[13-Dec-18 09:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont think its a "fed conspiracy" againa the right wingers

[13-Dec-18 09:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@wolfgang sapling is price growth potential for Arrr - since it allows more easy maintenance of wallets for exchanges - more easy adoption - but it's only potential, depends how well it will be used to get new listings

[13-Dec-18 09:30 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also user friendly so bigger potential for growth (about 5x faster transactions - if I'm not mistaken -, my avg z-tx was about 1 in before, so I expect it to be about 10s after sapling)

[13-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
50x faster

[13-Dec-18 12:54 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, big money doesn't want to pay more than $3400 it seems
how long can they hold the line? 🤔 
not long me thinks

[13-Dec-18 12:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
i believe big money will give in once $3600 holds

[13-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Tek not many places left... poloniex, but who cares about them

[13-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I'm going to make one more call the 2017 bull was super profitable for miners. I'm going to make the call that the 2020 bull will make the 2017 bull look like child's play.

Waves has been doing a good development job but this usually means absolutely nothing, it's strange for once seeing the crypto market valuing it. It gives hope that also Komodo and others can decouple from Btc

@Vertigo  you just had bad luck, usually if your tx has 1 conf. then it's good, I guess your tx was included in block 553679, and somehow it took 50 minutes to find block 553680
