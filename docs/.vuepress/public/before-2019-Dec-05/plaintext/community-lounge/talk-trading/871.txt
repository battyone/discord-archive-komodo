[27-Jun-19 07:55 PM] crumb#2550
ok, but how many users will be there day 1

[27-Jun-19 07:56 PM] crumb#2550
all i'm saying is, that it is a process

[27-Jun-19 07:56 PM] Markus#5464
how many other platforms got the feature to do so?

[27-Jun-19 07:56 PM] crumb#2550
no quick bucks

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] crumb#2550
i am not saying it is not good/cool/beneficial or whatever

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] crumb#2550
just don't expect something massive to happen overnight

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] crumb#2550
i'm not

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Markus#5464
it should be a quite big deal and can get alot of attention

[27-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Markus#5464
ofc u shouldnt expect anything within a day

[27-Jun-19 07:58 PM] crumb#2550
just following the dialogues here i get an impression that some people hope to make a quick buck

[27-Jun-19 07:58 PM] crumb#2550
they will get burned

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Markus#5464
i think most ppl can agree on kmd being totaly rekt last month or 2

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Markus#5464
from 28k to 9k

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Markus#5464
thats terrible

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] crumb#2550
i have bought some KMD @ 48k sats

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] crumb#2550
i'm not complaining. why should i?

[27-Jun-19 07:59 PM] Markus#5464
well that was during 2017....should never fomo parabolic rises

[27-Jun-19 08:00 PM] crumb#2550
it was not fomo. i bought in batches over a longer period of time

[27-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Markus#5464
well u got ur strategy so thats fine

[27-Jun-19 08:01 PM] crumb#2550

@Markus you only get rekt if you sold, if you dont sell, this is just noise

[27-Jun-19 08:07 PM] crumb#2550
also it's important to remember what was your rationale for buying in the first place

[27-Jun-19 08:07 PM] crumb#2550
if that has not changed, well no reason to worry

[27-Jun-19 08:07 PM] Markus#5464
I think many ppl expect btc value to rise to ATH on many alts....i dont think it will, like lets say btc will go to 100k end of this cycle,  would be silly to see lets say Eth being worth 0,1 in current state

[27-Jun-19 08:08 PM] crumb#2550
just embrace the fact that world does not go how you want it to go, **most** of the time

[27-Jun-19 08:13 PM] tolken#2655
@crumb i dont think it‚Äôs just a name, or else the July 15th would be meaningless. I expect there to be a whole lot of refined documentation to accompany it.

[27-Jun-19 08:14 PM] tolken#2655
I think it marks one of the most concrete evidence of marketing getting up to speed with the tech. The easier KMD is to use and understand, the faster the adoption.

[27-Jun-19 08:15 PM] crumb#2550
my point was not to expect immediate reaction in regards of price movements

[27-Jun-19 08:16 PM] crumb#2550
i don't mean to downplay the Antara announcement

[27-Jun-19 08:16 PM] tolken#2655
The KMD dump should be evidence of the significance of this release üòâ

[27-Jun-19 08:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD bears taking a stand, had 30k sell walls, half down on binance

[27-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Markus#5464
btc dropping so its expected

[27-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Markus#5464
$ price goes up in sats

[27-Jun-19 08:25 PM] blubbi#0643
if ur dealing with money, never decide emotional, be patience and rational

[27-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Hermes#6934
Hello there ...why my bitcoins are going down?

[27-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Hermes#6934
who is responsible for this?

[27-Jun-19 08:35 PM] kaks#6612
me

[27-Jun-19 08:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
jesus

[27-Jun-19 08:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is kmd going to sustain above $1

[27-Jun-19 08:44 PM] Oriol02#9169
People now is in panic. So you can expect the worst (in the short term). Every altcoin is sinking

[27-Jun-19 08:46 PM] crumb#2550
expression "blood in the streets" might be appropriate perhaps? and what do you do, when that happens? **SELL?** :troll_hardcore:

[27-Jun-19 08:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Hermes you need to jump into btc discord and ask them to market better

Pitty most households have had 5(and 2.4)Ghz wifi routers in their houses for years now. We better ban them all. And dont forget actual microwaves. That are used to heat food... with microwaves.. (2.45Ghz typically)
I'd be here all day if you wanted me to list everything around you that used between 300mhz and 300ghz.. You're a tin foil hat warrior if you think the introduction of a 5G system will have a large percentage increase of overall microwave radiation around you. It will be a minimal increase compared to whats already out there.

@CryptoInvestorAU there's "trading" and there's filling 3 screens with essentially the same thing
and then there's doing that thing  in 4 different channels

@polycryptoblog  Insects as well. There is as much as a 90% decline in insect populations now being reported in many areas

it's pretty neat when you can poison/irradiate a population and they pay you to do it.

im sure we'll feel the effects 10 years from now but it will be considered impossible to pinpoint that actual causes since its not immediate
