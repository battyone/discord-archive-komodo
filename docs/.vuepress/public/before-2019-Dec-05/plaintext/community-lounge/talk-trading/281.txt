Not really worried about KMD. But i am a little worried about a long, dismal crypto winter.

Someone got hold of @halfin first bitcoin address private key, spend from it in 2017, and encoded a message in late october into the last transaction.

They will try to claim it's an address Satoshi owned and the message is coming from him.

Uneducated people will believe ...

Impossible to know, access to a satoshi key is one thing, but could have been stolen

[16-Nov-18 08:54 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the address belonged to Hal Finney

[16-Nov-18 09:02 PM] Don King#8901
Either way (satoshi or Hal), message content is worth noting

[16-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Don King#8901
Hal is dead, so can't be him

[16-Nov-18 09:05 PM] Don King#8901
Yes, he is a possible candidate, no evidence will ever solve the satoshi riddle now, that's the way he/they wanted it

[16-Nov-18 09:27 PM] Don King#8901
You believe Hal gave CSW Bitcoin? Lol

[16-Nov-18 09:35 PM] Don King#8901
Hal said in 2013 he put all his Bitcoin in a safe deposit box for his family, if he was satoshi that's where the 1M satoshi Bitcoins are.

The proof that someone holds Satoshi's keys is that they move coins mined before block 78 (the first block mined by Hal Finney) and that they announce beforehand how much they are moving and what address they are moving the funds to.

That's it. Nothing else counts.

[16-Nov-18 09:40 PM] Don King#8901
IMO satoshi entity includes ķleiman, CSW, Hal, plus some others. Who controls keys now does not prove who did what, some keys could have been given to others voluntarily,  some other stolen. Ķleiman and Hal are dead, and we will never know how CSW, or anyone else, came to possess them. Does look like CSW has some satoshi keys, even if he acts like a dick

[16-Nov-18 09:43 PM] Don King#8901
I agree, CSW is not 100% of satoshi, but he probably knows more of truth than anyone alive. He never claimed to be 100% of satoshi, he always said others helped him

[16-Nov-18 09:43 PM] modereck#4269
but whats the purpose of CSW? what he want for crypto in general?

[16-Nov-18 09:45 PM] Don King#8901
I don't like segwit,  and prefer big blocks for scaling, so I agree with CSW, but he is an argumentative arrogant dick, BUT, I think he hams that up now, free marketing

[16-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Don King#8901

SV is catching up, this war needs to stop 😑

[17-Nov-18 08:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
seems to me BCH brand may collapse totally - first failure was loosing BTC brand 2. is war, which is worse then splitting - as one side wants to destroy the other value is much less certain - on normal fork usually if you hodl you don't loose - have both coins, but here 1 coin want to kill the other - different story

[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I wonder which coin will gain the most after BCH lost

[17-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What if the losing party points its hash towards btc

[17-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sparking a pump because more costly to mine btc

[17-Nov-18 08:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
sv only 6 blocks behind now. but what that means, if anything, idk.

[17-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
they are different forks, it only matters if people think it matters

[17-Nov-18 09:12 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so SV is not planning destroy ABC fork anymore ?

[17-Nov-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
they are, but since they are different chains now, its not like ABC fork will reorg to the SV fork even if the SV fork becomes the longest chain

[17-Nov-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so SV needs to mine SV for public opinion and separately attack ABC just to do whatever attack they want to do

[17-Nov-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
in a normal 51% attack, there is only one chain to deal with. here, there are 2

[17-Nov-18 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
Abc just jacked their hash way up. Pretty entertaining honestly. just gonna sit back and watch the money burn.

We can, the price of BTC will continue to be depressed.. well you know, there are electricity bills and we hold BCH as we burn BTC.

But, all this does is make https://t.co/qTwQRglyGU and Antpool less viable as the market overall drops... So, win win

they are both burning hashrate for bragging rights. there are two different chains (without replay protection), so the market would need to decide which is the real BCH

[17-Nov-18 01:38 PM] snowdamn#2414
i hope the market dumps and goes back to BTC
right after, Core bites the bullet and comes with a MAJOR block increase
BCH never recovers
things go back to normal
i wake up
