Time to convert some to bullion

[13-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Markus#5464
XRP shouldnt even be on the list, it should be used by banks not exchanges

[13-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Dec 2017 was time to convert to bullion, now is ime to get into the few good cryptos

[13-Mar-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ... ripple labs did make crypto conditions that we based our smart contracts on .... so theres that I guess, they ended up removving it from XRP too I saw the other day, so we got it for nothing. üòÉ

[13-Mar-19 03:45 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok, had breakfast...time to get some AWS stuff working

[13-Mar-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm... I think we should make an AWS endpoint for this migrate processor man, it should be really easy.. and can easily process entire blocks of migrate transactions

[13-Mar-19 03:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[13-Mar-19 03:47 AM] Mylo#8306

[13-Mar-19 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool. I'll keep testing it and bug fxing... it will eb really easy to slap a front end on it and do batch process.

[13-Mar-19 03:48 AM] Mylo#8306

Fuck is going on with the price

[13-Mar-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its working atm... but I have some problems with the status output... it makes so many variations of the import txn, that it loses track of the txid of the one that was sucessful

[13-Mar-19 03:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok sorry
