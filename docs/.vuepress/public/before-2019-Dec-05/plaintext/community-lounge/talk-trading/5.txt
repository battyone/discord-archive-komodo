[slack] <hollowman9000> Wat

[15-Jun-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> @ dafuq u think ur going

[15-Jun-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Matrix!

[15-Jun-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> it sucks, but it's safer

[15-Jun-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> fundazu safu?

[15-Jun-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> How many super important secrets are you guys sharing in the backrooms of slack?

[15-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> You don't want to know. We would have to kill you after you know.

[15-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon>

[15-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Ignorance is bliss.

[15-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> tell me

[15-Jun-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> One way ticket, there is no come back.

[15-Jun-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I don't know man... there are some pictures circulating about some team members wearing bikini in the beach... James drunk dancing on a table... no man, you don't want to know, seriously.

[15-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Now I understand

[15-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Rule n.1 about the komodo backrooms

[15-Jun-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Dont talk about the komodo backrooms

[15-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Hahaha joking... it's just end-to-end encryption. Beta, or alpha, idk, so don't send privkeys, but... safer than Slack. I seriously assume that a lot of Slack employees have access to our PM's.

[15-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> sending privkeys over the internet or in general seems like a bad idea

[15-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Same for telegram, the decription key to decrypt chats is held by the company

[15-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> I think that #trading belongs to Discord, a lot more people there. Sadly Discord does not allow login in from a vpn.

[15-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> So it's a no-no to me.

[15-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Discord doesnt allow vpn?

[15-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Weird

[15-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Oh, i didn't know. Well, here it is not held by any company, your keys are yours.

[15-Jun-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> So, i'm recommending this app (riot.im on Matrix.org) to everyone, EVEN WHEN IT SUCKS right now, from a UX point of view.

[15-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> Cryptoon, it allows via SMS confirmation. I didn't test if those virtual cellphone numbers are working for it, i'll try right now and tell you.

[15-Jun-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Not sure if they are valid solutions though

[15-Jun-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Jun-18 04:45 PM] elPataDeLana#9387
