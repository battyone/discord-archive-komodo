per piece

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Buddz1993#5380
This is the reality of things unfortunately

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Any investment I make, I write off in my mind. At the moment I invest it’s a big loss. If it returns me some, it’s all profit that way.

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Caglio#3337
yes

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:16 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:16 AM] Caglio#3337
so invest more here advice

[11-Aug-19 11:16 AM] Caglio#3337
doesnt really help me right

[11-Aug-19 11:16 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
If you’re in that deep, I can only conclude that you invested more than you’re prepared to loose.

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Exactly my friend

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Caglio#3337
honeslty people dont invest money to lose it

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Caglio#3337
and honestly always same bullshit talks

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Caglio#3337
6.5$

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Only invest like 10% of your total capital

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Caglio#3337
we csnt go under 5.5$

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Caglio#3337
unless we do

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] Buddz1993#5380
10-20% is already a lot

[11-Aug-19 11:17 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
In that case: don’t sit staring at exchange rates. Leave it be for a month or two... better for your heart. You’ll live longer

[11-Aug-19 11:18 AM] Caglio#3337
u dont get me

[11-Aug-19 11:18 AM] Caglio#3337
this 10k is dead

[11-Aug-19 11:18 AM] Caglio#3337
no recover from it ever

[11-Aug-19 11:18 AM] Caglio#3337
but i cannot afford myself new investment

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
If you feel that way: take your losses and let somebody else profit from your cheap assets.

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Caglio#3337
and the whole idea of invest more pisses me off

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Caglio#3337
lol if i lost 8.5 k

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Caglio#3337
doesnt really đatters is it 10 or 8.5

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Caglio#3337
if i was 10/15% in a loss ok

[11-Aug-19 11:19 AM] Caglio#3337
i can live with that

[11-Aug-19 11:20 AM] Caglio#3337
and repay debt with it

[11-Aug-19 11:20 AM] Caglio#3337

[11-Aug-19 11:20 AM] Caglio#3337
so no

[11-Aug-19 11:20 AM] Caglio#3337
but investing more ? big no

[11-Aug-19 11:22 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I recently liquidated coins below 1% of their purchase value. I gambled wrong on those coins. Luckily I spread the risk. In this market I don’t sell anything. I’ll leave it be for a while. My annual investment budget is depleted, so I feel bad I cannot invest more at the moment.

[11-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s obviously sad , but if you believe in the team and that they have a product that will be used in the future you have simply to wait for a rebound if you think a rebound won’t likely to happen and lost faith in the project independently of the losses just take them and move on

[11-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s gonna be better for your health

[11-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Caglio#3337
i dont believe we are hitting 6$

[11-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
not in the near future

[11-Aug-19 11:24 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I believe we’ll hit that... eventually... no telling when... if I could, I’ld be a billionaire...

[11-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
i was rdy to pay more than 6$ in the past, while I wouldnt pay 1$ anymore, so I guess I lost the faith someway along

[11-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Caglio#3337
and maybe one day yeah, but time is also important thing

[11-Aug-19 11:25 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
These are difficult times for all altcoins. All we small investors can do is wait patiently for better times.

[11-Aug-19 11:27 AM] Buddz1993#5380
Exactly either wait or take the loss if you think it’s gonna drop even further

[11-Aug-19 11:27 AM] Buddz1993#5380
So your dollar cost average was 6$?

[11-Aug-19 11:29 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
If one invested in January (the worst time to board), that would be possible.

[11-Aug-19 11:29 AM] Buddz1993#5380
i was rdy to pay more than 6$ in the past, while I wouldnt pay 1$ anymore, so I guess I lost the faith someway along < when KMD was worth 6$  it hadn’t done half of what it achieved today and now we are trading at 90 cents range so it’s kinda oversold and undervalued imho

[11-Aug-19 11:30 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It is still an altcoin and behaves like that... no matter what tech involved, all altcoins go through that period.

[11-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Buddz1993#5380
How long it will take to reach those levels again ? I would like very much to know but no one can tell you that not even TA.

[11-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Buddz1993#5380
exactly it’s pegged to btc

[11-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Buddz1993#5380
So it depends on btc .

[11-Aug-19 11:31 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Since economic growth is decreasing all over the world, I suspect we’ll be in for a rough ride

[11-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
@Buddz1993 nah average is below, 4 would be ok for me

[11-Aug-19 12:06 PM] Caglio#3337
maybe 4 and something

[11-Aug-19 01:18 PM] JvdP#8992
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 maybe not. Look at how people flee into gold when the economy takes a nose dive. With bitcoin a "store of value", you might see similar action in your rough ride scenario...

[11-Aug-19 01:21 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It could result in different scenarios... people could stop investing in crypto, but it could also result in fleeing into crypto. We’ve never seen crypto acting in a global depression, so as far as I’m concerned: anything is possible.

[11-Aug-19 01:52 PM] designer#4893
Research is overrated. You learn by doing, not searching. Research only gets you what others are thinking about.

[11-Aug-19 01:55 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Research allows you to learn from other people’s mistakes, instead of making them yourself.

[11-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Any reason my message got deleted earlier? Is there a narrative I need to be sticking to?

[11-Aug-19 03:41 PM] CoinKing88#1540
We dont like Bond villains, you should have stayed in Gold, mr Finger

[11-Aug-19 03:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245
🤔

[11-Aug-19 04:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Bitfinger what was your comment?

[11-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Bitfinger#6245
4hr bull div working out nicely

[11-Aug-19 04:11 PM] Bitfinger#6245
I'd mentioned it 14hrs earlier that's why

[11-Aug-19 04:11 PM] phm87#7395
BTCUSD 4h or KMDBTC 4h ?

[11-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Kmdbtc... wouldn't chat btc here

[11-Aug-19 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont think that is a comment worth deleting

[11-Aug-19 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have been looking at that for the past couple of days

[11-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Me either

[11-Aug-19 04:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have been looking at a "bottoming structure" the last couple of days

[11-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yeah I posted a chart a couple of days ago... looks like bottoming to me

[11-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Been KMD supporter since btcd swap so don't hate me coz of my avatar

[11-Aug-19 04:17 PM] Bitfinger#6245
If we can push past this little top at 7800 in the next few hours we could get a nice pump vs. Btc... I'm expecting btc to go below 9k soon

[11-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Bitfinger#6245
gl everyone

[11-Aug-19 04:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
godspeed

[11-Aug-19 04:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
good luck

[11-Aug-19 04:39 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Hey y’all. May I ask a daft question?

[11-Aug-19 04:39 PM] washparkdlt#6482
kmd is no longer a privacy coin, is that correct?

[11-Aug-19 04:40 PM] phm87#7395
Yes. It is fully transparent now

[11-Aug-19 04:41 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Thanks @phm87.

[11-Aug-19 04:57 PM] crumb#2550
afaik less than 1% of kmd users were using z addresses anyways. use ARRR now. that's also jl777 suggestion btw 😃

[11-Aug-19 04:58 PM] washparkdlt#6482
Thanks @crumb. I’m not looking for a privacy coin myself, just wanted to make sure kmd was now fully transparent.

[11-Aug-19 05:02 PM] washparkdlt#6482
That number (1%) is fairly common across privacy coins (or features) afaik. Others have reported similar usage.

[11-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pirate is 99.99% private

[11-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Probably more

[11-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Forced shielded transaction is the only way to ensure privacy

[11-Aug-19 05:27 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I see. Thanks @Cryptoon

[11-Aug-19 05:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
funny how quite it becomes here when KMD (and every other alt but ok) is slowing climbing, haters went to sleep 😄

[11-Aug-19 05:29 PM] washparkdlt#6482
I’m going to search to see if I can find an article about the “transition”. It’s interesting

[11-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Transition?

[11-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CoinKing88 hehe true

[11-Aug-19 05:39 PM] washparkdlt#6482
kmd moving from privacy to full transparency

[11-Aug-19 05:39 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
is there any way to get old price date from bittrex back?

[11-Aug-19 05:40 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
tradingview changed someting a few weeks ago, so the chart before that is not loading data

[11-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@washparkdlt aha, I believe jl made a medium post about it, not sure

[11-Aug-19 05:45 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@CoinKing88 ready for 0.00004 KMD/BTC? If we break down here. That's 50 cent bottom :>

[11-Aug-19 05:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
bring it on, 50 cents would be a nice level to get some more kmd

[11-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Neko#5830
too good to be true

[11-Aug-19 06:07 PM] Caglio#3337
@CoinKing88 I dont think there are kmd haters in here honestly
