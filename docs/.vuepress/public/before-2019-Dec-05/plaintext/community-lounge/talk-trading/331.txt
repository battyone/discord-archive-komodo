@Steve Lee in my experience exchanges who lost zcash are open to listing pirate and therefore KMD. üòú
Hit up Brian Armstrong!

JUST IN: S&P 500 futures plunge as much as 1.9% on heavy volume. Traders couldn‚Äôt immediately pinpoint a trigger for a decline of that magnitude https://t.co/Ykv1qx2VaW

maybe the US stock market imploding is what we need to start another bull market

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Weird

[06-Dec-18 08:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if it has anything to do with the OPEC decision planned

Spx imploding might be what we need for btc to really die

[06-Dec-18 09:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
people talk about breaking the btc/altcoin  peg.

[06-Dec-18 09:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
but I think breaking the crypto/stock market correlation would be a big deal

[06-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or that crypto can finally be a contrarian investment to stocks

[06-Dec-18 09:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
How

[06-Dec-18 09:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its so far speculatuve technology

[06-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Its a replacement for the traditional system manipulated by banks and governments

[06-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Although crypto is manipulated as well

[06-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
At least the prices are

[06-Dec-18 09:35 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

MakerDAO peg is still holding but thing start to look hot, if Eth falls below ~92 there could be a compounding liquiditation effect and below ~65 is total disaster

[06-Dec-18 09:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
if current bottom holds, i predict $7250 BTC & $325 ETH short-term

[06-Dec-18 09:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
new bets would have to be placed at those levels

[06-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Vertigo#0439

üôè it's short squeeze or they're out for blood...

[06-Dec-18 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ETH touched $96 USDT on binance

[06-Dec-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
barely holding $100 USDT

[06-Dec-18 11:15 AM] snowdamn#2414
if BTC doesn't hold current bottom, kiss it bye bye

[06-Dec-18 11:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
double digit eth is a death sentence for the majority of ico's

[06-Dec-18 11:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
if they didn't cash out... or did their ico in the ussa

[06-Dec-18 11:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
I have a feeling solidity dev's will be a little bit cheaper for a while

[06-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
lot already cashed out

[06-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Flexatron#8809
the smart ones atleast

[06-Dec-18 11:27 AM] Flexatron#8809
the big stocks have been bulling too long..was in need of a correction imo

[06-Dec-18 11:29 AM] Flexatron#8809
glad I got out of the vanguard all stock early

[06-Dec-18 11:30 AM] snowdamn#2414
question is if we should've gotten out of crypto end of 2017 üò∂

[06-Dec-18 11:31 AM] snowdamn#2414
many lambos sacrificed...

[06-Dec-18 11:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah work asked me about the 401k thing, no thanks, I've seen this show before.

[06-Dec-18 11:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
spoiler alert... it's all a giant shit show

[06-Dec-18 11:50 AM] Flexatron#8809

It's always darkest before the dawn

[06-Dec-18 12:58 PM] LocoMB#8593
WAVES made  a nice pump by 100% in BTC- from 27k to 54k Sat

[06-Dec-18 12:59 PM] LocoMB#8593
team always seemed very determined- looks like they are getting somewhere now

[06-Dec-18 01:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
factom is doing very well also. A great team who has done a lot for the crypto community in my neck of the woods. I am glad to see their success in these market conditions.

[06-Dec-18 01:13 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yep, factom's performance is quite impressive

ETH $98...

[06-Dec-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
EOS is almost below $2

[06-Dec-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
15 cents to go

[06-Dec-18 01:44 PM] snowdamn#2414
everything is automated against BTC moves
question is if BTC has hit bottom or not
no one with pockets big enough to move the market is looking outside BTC...

[06-Dec-18 01:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
btc breaks 3500 today

[06-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why

[06-Dec-18 02:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
idk, I just like making bs predictions.

[06-Dec-18 02:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
i wouldn't be surprised if we get a $1000 hourly candle tbh

[06-Dec-18 02:01 PM] snowdamn#2414
going up lol

[06-Dec-18 02:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
eth hit double digits. ico's are in full panic mode right now

[06-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as if they werent already lol

[06-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
there is no difference between 200 or 100$ ETH if you raised most of your capital when ETH was 1000$ üòÑ

[06-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Blood every where and BCHSV decides to pump. Someone is using their own cash to prop the price up.

[06-Dec-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
And what makes you think that doesn't happen with BTC too üôÑ

[06-Dec-18 02:14 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
BCHSV doesn't control the entire market. For it to break from the standard norm means someone has a deep attachment to it.

[06-Dec-18 02:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
i wonder who that could be?

[06-Dec-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the ABC/SV ratio is almost 1:1!

[06-Dec-18 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
wasnt it 5/1 at one point?

[06-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It did and with the market going the way it is, perfect time to push it to finally surpass it.

[06-Dec-18 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810
bitmain doesnt have any more money to pump ABC

[06-Dec-18 02:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
where the hell is sv getting its money? are they just gonna burn it a big bonfire forever?

[06-Dec-18 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
One of SV's backers is a Casino Billionaire

[06-Dec-18 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They will continue to pump it ... only questrion is when they will stop

I dint believe a player like bitmain will give up easy billions... better to make friends with some govs or other billionairs, make a news that will pump to 1k $
