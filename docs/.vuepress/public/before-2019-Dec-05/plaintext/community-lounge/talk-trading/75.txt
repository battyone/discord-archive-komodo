hmmm. doesnt seem like th e joking kind to me

tx, that clarifys

joking not the number but wheter this explain alts down as it's just the same way of saying the same thing

[31-Jul-18 07:27 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
btc dominance = alts down

[31-Jul-18 07:28 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or 4 = IIII

[31-Jul-18 11:38 PM] ryman112#0068
That still doesn't quite explain why alts are down.  Eventually one wont have anything to do with the other.  Totally separate entities and investments.

[31-Jul-18 11:41 PM] ryman112#0068
Google doesn't have anything to do with Ford or Johnson and Johnson so on and so forth.  Just shows how early we are in this market.

[31-Jul-18 11:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
alts are down because there's mass delusion that any price under $9999999999999999999999 for BTC is bad

[31-Jul-18 11:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and BTC is a stone around our necks when delusions say that BTC is doing poorly at only 10x over 24 months

[01-Aug-18 07:24 AM] Malti#3948
didn't you get it at a better price last weeks than you would get it now? :p

[01-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[01-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
lowest I bought was at 21k sats

[01-Aug-18 07:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think it was like 23 when I 1st bought last year

[01-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
last year lowest I bought was 17k I think

[01-Aug-18 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
either I missed that or it was before I found KMD

[01-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Malti#3948
I bought through Bitpanda last week for fiat

[01-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Malti#3948
which was nice

[01-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Malti#3948
thanks to Cryptoon as I wasn't aware :p

[01-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Correction, lowesst I bought was 20k december 7

[01-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
After that it dipped a bit further before the runup

[01-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Selling on hyper not the best way

[01-Aug-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As the orders don't stay open I think

[01-Aug-18 08:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
correct, hyper does not have "good til canceled"

[01-Aug-18 08:22 AM] kknd#1201
better off using bdex?

Bit of a stretch at best

[02-Aug-18 12:33 AM] jspook16#3059
how does somebody earn crypto when they are a liquidit provider? is it fees?

How is net hash determined?

[02-Aug-18 12:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it solely calculated from difficulty

[02-Aug-18 12:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or is there some form of self-reporting going on with how much hashpower you have?

[02-Aug-18 12:38 AM] jspook16#3059
no idea

[02-Aug-18 12:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
From difficulty

[02-Aug-18 01:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Hollowman9000 `How is net hash determined?`
Almost always it's an estimated calculation of what hash it would "likely" take to solve the last *X* blocks in the time that they were solved in

[02-Aug-18 01:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, diff and time are the only true factors

[02-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sorry a bit out of the loop üòõ What exactly is a crypto-condition, is komodo the only blockchain with them or are there others? What advantages does it have to smart contracts/are they the same

[02-Aug-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
google cryptoconditions, it is a proposed IETF specification. to my knowledge KMD is the only one with a working implementation. CC contracts are utxo based. As such it has the advantage that things like a dice CC can be written in a few days and it is totally blockchain enforced. the downside is that it is utxo based and a totally different way of doing contracts. Currently I have written assets/tokens with built in DEX, faucet, rewards and dice. in the last 2 weeks. they are at cli level only.

still in testing, but there are rpc calls that already work. These are native contracts and run at full speed. I think ultimately there will be a large overlap in the types of contracts that can be done via CC and by other methods, but probably some would only be able to be done via CC and there might be some that CC cant do (though I have not run into any such yet)

[02-Aug-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the more you get into mining, and only take out of it the actual expenses, is the more you can grow mining and afford to spec other things
but that's a scale thing, because no one is getting rich off 1 ASIC or 1 GPU
