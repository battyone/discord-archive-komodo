over DOW 30K just before US elections

[12-Apr-19 11:42 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but this will be the last imo

[12-Apr-19 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
after this move, the end of the world will come.

[12-Apr-19 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
maybe not... who knows

[12-Apr-19 11:43 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
inflating a bubble with free money works until it doesnt.

[12-Apr-19 11:45 AM] klein#5233
as crazy as that chart looks DOW over 30k

[12-Apr-19 11:46 AM] klein#5233
this is the most unloved bull market

[12-Apr-19 11:46 AM] klein#5233
we haven't hit mass euphoria

[12-Apr-19 11:52 AM] klein#5233
US indexes into all time highs could be the catalyst that puts the bottom in crypto

[12-Apr-19 11:53 AM] Sherdogz#6731
😬 I shouldn't have sold yesterday

[12-Apr-19 11:53 AM] klein#5233
KMD making a move

[12-Apr-19 11:53 AM] klein#5233
always HODL

[12-Apr-19 11:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, you should have sold your BTC yesterday

[12-Apr-19 11:53 AM] klein#5233
I concur

[12-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes I see it now eel shit happens 😏

[12-Apr-19 11:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
buy high, sell low = 🚫 
don't do that

[12-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
when BTC went up, the other coins sold off

[12-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then BTC went down and the other coins sold off again

[12-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a sign that one of these sells were not right and will be undone

[12-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
unless it is the end of the world

[12-Apr-19 11:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please, raise your hands whoever fud sold KMD yesterday 🖐

[12-Apr-19 11:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
😂

[12-Apr-19 11:57 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that seems to be a trend when the unicorns and rainbows only make quick appearances
>BTC is up sell everything we're getting rich!
>BTC is down sell everything we're doomed!

[12-Apr-19 11:57 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I bought more am I even allowed to say that? :troll_king:

[12-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Other coins selling when btc pumps and dumps is something that happens frequently.

[12-Apr-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but it makes no sense

[12-Apr-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
on one of those, but not both especailly in the same time period

[12-Apr-19 11:59 AM] klein#5233
It doesn't have to make sense

[12-Apr-19 11:59 AM] klein#5233

[12-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Sherdogz#6731

`people are irrational`
Welcome aboard, Captain Obvious, it's nice to meet you...

[12-Apr-19 12:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Moods here change so drastically given the conditions of the market lol

[12-Apr-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Wave 1 is insecure hope, wave 2 is quick mood change to dispair

[12-Apr-19 12:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
seems bipolar as usual

[12-Apr-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The wave 3 comes and acknoledgement happens

[12-Apr-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
4th is a sudden realization of risk

[12-Apr-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And 5th who we all know its euphoria

[12-Apr-19 12:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
What wave are we on now?  Waters feel a little choppy.

[12-Apr-19 12:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
And I keep feeling something nibble on my toes. It’s freaking me out.

[12-Apr-19 12:54 PM] klein#5233
I marked out a few days ago

[12-Apr-19 12:54 PM] klein#5233
going to keep scaling in at these areas

[12-Apr-19 12:54 PM] klein#5233
but if we break below 89

[12-Apr-19 12:54 PM] klein#5233
and stay below it could get bad

89 looks like a very important level we have to hold above

[12-Apr-19 12:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
With all due respect I can't trust anything u say because u think hybrid cars are a good idea :troll_king:

[12-Apr-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein why look at KMD/USD chart?

[12-Apr-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
My 70 yr old mom likes hers

[12-Apr-19 12:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'm a bush nechanic

[12-Apr-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
you are adding the variable of KMD/BTC to BTC/USD in your chart, it makes no sense

[12-Apr-19 01:00 PM] klein#5233
I'm happy to have this conversation off topic

[12-Apr-19 01:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe if KMD/USD had volume, but it doesn't

just like ZEC/USD chart is not nearly as useful as ZEC/BTC, but that is just me

[12-Apr-19 01:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
But KMD/APPL

[12-Apr-19 01:01 PM] klein#5233
funny you say that people I know who have built fink race trucks think toyota hybrid are great

[12-Apr-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Find some parts for a hybrid when stuck in the Australian outback

[12-Apr-19 01:02 PM] klein#5233
becuse they also owned and repaired them

[12-Apr-19 01:02 PM] klein#5233

`you are adding the variable of KMD/BTC to BTC/USD in your chart, it makes no sense`
careful @dukeleto you're starting to sound like that genie guy 😛

[12-Apr-19 01:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@dukeleto true, market with most volume should br the one used for charting

[12-Apr-19 01:14 PM] klein#5233
@dukeleto because people still ultimately care about usd value

[12-Apr-19 01:14 PM] klein#5233
look at that chart and see how many times it had a reaction off that level

[12-Apr-19 01:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I guess that's why genies unicorn is everywhere

[12-Apr-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`look at that chart and see how many times it had a reaction off that level`
and look at both charts and see how often there **isn't** a 1:1 conversion across the mess

[12-Apr-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the number of times that the "correct" inverse movement happens is far less than one might think

[12-Apr-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
42%

[12-Apr-19 01:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Always been 42%

[12-Apr-19 01:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[12-Apr-19 01:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
