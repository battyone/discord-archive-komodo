the easiest way would be provide a nxt address, user send the asset to that address with their waves address in a message

[27-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I did receive another message by the looks of it from sasha. Not sure but a link to https://twitter.com/coinomat1

[27-Mar-19 01:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's another guy, he contacted me too, he was trying organize a group to pressure Sasha about the swap. It seems it worked

[27-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I knew it was a new twitter account and was skeptical. Will still do the email address thing again and go watch a movie since he is no JL777.

I swapped everything to waves during ICO

[27-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Read between the lines with his response to my “is it better to hodl the nxt assets or swap”

[27-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
He said better to swap

[27-Mar-19 01:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So I swapped

[27-Mar-19 01:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Even negotiated above his published swap prices for cryptocard

[27-Mar-19 01:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sank the waves into chronobank ICO because profit is the enemy

[27-Mar-19 01:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Poor Nxt, not even page 1 cmc material anymore

[27-Mar-19 01:28 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I talked to sasha directly during the swap and he swore that cryptofund would not be abandoned. I kept those 40k crytpofunds and I've regretted it since. It did make me ignore waves and put money elsewhere.

[27-Mar-19 01:28 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Ardor at 66°

[27-Mar-19 01:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Waves has done good for me, I decided to hold the assets and it wasn't a problem to wait a few years but I wished for more clarity about their future

[27-Mar-19 01:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fahrenheit or Celsius?

[27-Mar-19 01:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I dumped everything on the nxt platform

[27-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Minus a transpotimer ticket

[27-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Poor time bus

[27-Mar-19 01:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Ardor chart is as flat as dead. Lesson: if jl777 says your idea is flawed, listen

[27-Mar-19 01:32 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I still got a large chunk of Waves during the ICO and made out during the bull run but never consider it a long hold because of what sasha did to the NXT assets. If he had just said "swap or lose out" my ass would have swapped.

[27-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I dumped 30k waves prior to their rocket

[27-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sucked watching chronobank tank while waves rocketed

[27-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@Hollowman9000 do you think waves will go up after    the Vostok airdrop?

[27-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No idea, I don’t have an interest in waves anymore

[27-Mar-19 03:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Veriblock is doing a IEO in bittrex and bittrex i shilling the hell out of them

[27-Mar-19 05:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im told that Bill Shihara who works at bittrex is also a team member of veriblock, so there is that in case you see a lot of news and shills about it

[27-Mar-19 05:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
they are marketing it as the first and only way to secure a blockchain with bitcoin level security checkpoints

[27-Mar-19 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`first and only`?
 I'm 😕 and 😖

`*jl777cToday at 12:36 AM*
the reality is that the market for dPoW is the first few pages of CMC. dPoW primary purpose is to secure the KMD ecosystem. If that is all it does, it is fine. The twitterati are not the customers
Adding more coins is a service we provide, basically at our cost to other projects, so if they want to take advantage of it, then we are happy to help. if not, it is ok too.
We have by far the most efficient notarization service immune to nicehash notarizations as only elected notaries can make a proposed notarization as a group. Cost per notarization is 1 KMD txfee every 10 blocks vs. N BTC txfee every block. Maybe I am wrong about the N BTC txfee per block per chain, but based on the number of VBK BTC tx during testnet (for one coin?), it could certainly be the correct math
so dozens of BTC txfee per block paid for by share of coins mining reward... the economics dont seem to be too good for these chains`

[27-Mar-19 06:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
`*jl777cToday at 12:12 AM*
if VBK will saturate the BTC blockchain with all the notarizations for coins that cant afford to pay a few thousand a year, then it will take a load off of us to secure just the larger chains. So these smaller chains will end up paying 10x more in their own coin that for dPoW and to miners... who tend to sell, which would cause downward pressure, maybe not so much if it is only 1% of blockreward, but what if it ends up at 10%+ of blockreward
Anyway, if VBK does really well, that puts a rough valuation on the dPoW aspect of komodo, even if it is assumed they are of equivalent value. so this will be interesting to see`

yet another "we did it first" statement from another coin yey... 🙄

[27-Mar-19 06:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
Well back in the day blocknet proclaimed something similar about an atomic swaps exchange. You can see where they are now. Let them have their fun. If it works, more power to them.

"first and only way to secure a blockchain with bitcoin level security checkpoints in an entirely Decentralized, Trustless, Transparent, and Permissionless (“DTTP”) manner"  

the key word is 'permissionless', they make a great deal of it but, as jl777 explained, there are good reason he choose the 64 notary way. 'permissionless' could backfire greatly and costs are much higher

[27-Mar-19 07:19 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
when there's more usage and data, a comparison matrix w dPoW will be very useful for marketing

Litecoin Whale Brings Decentralization Issue to Forefront - Dash News
This post is also available in: DeutschLitecoin has recently come under scrutiny for having 35.4 million Litecoins, or about 60% of the total coin supply, moved by one entity. The move was initially pointed out by Weiss Ratings, which does not bode well for the cryptocurrency...

is it just me or does that "whale" look like a cartoon image of Trump? 🤔

[27-Mar-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
60% of LTC owned by a single entity? maybe a CEX? early miner? how can anybody get 60%

[27-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That seems crazy, cant it be coinbase or something like that? But even then, such centralization isnt a good thing...

[27-Mar-19 09:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can image a lot of new people buying ltc on coinbase because it is a ‘cheap’ coin and then keeping them on cb

_wonders how we went from dICOs last year to "IEOs" on CEXs this year 🤔_

[27-Mar-19 10:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its the newest money printing scheme

[27-Mar-19 10:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although bittrex and coinbene are doing it wrong

[27-Mar-19 10:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You need to launch your coin first like BNB and you need that coin only to buy into the IEO, that way you get a double pump, one from the ieo and one from your own coin

[27-Mar-19 10:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Such amateurs 🙄

[27-Mar-19 10:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends on the circumstances of your project which is the best method for public offering'

[27-Mar-19 10:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
Coinbene has their own coin though, it's called CONI

[27-Mar-19 10:37 PM] PHBA2061#2530
anyway the IEO model benefit both the CEX & the projects

[27-Mar-19 10:38 PM] PHBA2061#2530
only those speculators have no idea what they're about to buy though lol

[28-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I like seeing something daily, makes me feel people are dedicated and the coin is alive.  like the komodo tech tuesday and the friday emails.   some coins, they basically look dead most of the time.

[28-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
with yet another exchange hack of only ETH, I begin to wonder if ETH is fundamentally less secure than BTC based coins. Certainly having all the ERC20 accessible via same ETH privkey makes things less isolated, but both cryptopia and coinbene only lost ETH and ERC20...

[28-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
could it be the exchanges are using some lite wallet like parity?

[28-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Alexfrog#1338
what do you mean another one, today?

[28-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
cryptopia and now coinbene, two rather large ETH based hacks

[28-Mar-19 07:42 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ive never heard of coinbene

[28-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810

[28-Mar-19 07:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol, their tweet about it was "Somebody doubt CoinBene was attacked by hacker recently because our maintenance.
We CoinBene are so sorry that made everyone worried for this problem".  

Much english, such professional. 😄

[28-Mar-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
seems google translate it was

[28-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so, these exchanges should probably make a different wallet for every ERC20 token, with different keys stored independently

[28-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so they dont lose every one of them to a single hack
