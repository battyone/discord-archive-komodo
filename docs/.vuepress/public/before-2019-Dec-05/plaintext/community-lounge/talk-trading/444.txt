litterally cashed out my fiat the other day about 5mins before that huge red candle... was so lucky

[27-Feb-19 01:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sadly that pretty much true lol

[27-Feb-19 01:48 AM] Markus#5464
i had a strong feeling it was going to happen

[27-Feb-19 01:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
same... there was too many moon charts being posted

[27-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed, assoon as a tiny green candle shows up whole of twitter and around goes bullish lol

[27-Feb-19 01:50 AM] Likewise#6767
so guess what wil happen......yep the hure red dildo does his thing

[27-Feb-19 01:50 AM] Markus#5464
but at the same time its pretty interesting to see how literally every big company started talking about blockchain recently

[27-Feb-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
blockchain isnt going away ... the tech is extremly lucrative for the big boys.. it enables their spy machine to be more efficiant

[27-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes, this is another thing I'm followoing closely.......institutional money?? Really, well so far PA is telling is the complete opposite.

[27-Feb-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but due to BTC core... they are probably not going to use BTC üò¶

[27-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Likewise#6767
devs have fucked up on a lot of projects with their childish nerdish attitude

[27-Feb-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I spent my time not trading but learning hwo it works... and coding etc, this community has been awesome... in a year I have gone from noob to dev... I figure I willl always have a job in this space and thats how I will get my fortune üòÉ

[27-Feb-19 01:52 AM] Likewise#6767
it is this baby attotude that keeps real money away

[27-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
that's awesome bro, I have no idea about coding lol

[27-Feb-19 01:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC core is there just for that reason lol.. they are paid by someone

[27-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
I'm leaning that way too

[27-Feb-19 01:54 AM] Markus#5464
for sure u doing well black, even being a notary node operator for KMD is great, i would like to take a shot at that aswell but dont see myself getting on average 1 mil votes

[27-Feb-19 01:54 AM] Likewise#6767
and dont know but if I have to choose between Ver and WRight. The Doc it is, jsut have more confidence in his personality then Ver. I know both are scammers but IF have to choose. WRight it is

[27-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Likewise#6767
sad really that the inudtry is  being held back by politics really, hence why I say that they shold stop making fools about themseves about privacy and decentralized lol.

[27-Feb-19 01:55 AM] Likewise#6767
this whole show is far from decentralized. Ask coinbase and good ol ripple lol or whatever they like to callthemselves

[27-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Markus#5464
lol XRP is the most centralized crap, isnt like 85% of supply held by the team itself

What I think, very very unpopular but it couild well be that 20K was the all time high, never to be breached again or maybe in a few years on a fluke

[27-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Likewise#6767
I know, being sarcastic

[27-Feb-19 01:56 AM] Markus#5464
ye i know üòÑ

[27-Feb-19 01:57 AM] Likewise#6767
who is it bro < Ver or WRight

[27-Feb-19 01:57 AM] Likewise#6767
I'm with Wright to choose the less of both evils

[27-Feb-19 01:57 AM] Markus#5464
well i quess time will tell what btc will look like in the future

[27-Feb-19 01:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
SV is the clostest thing to the real BTC just by facts ... but not sure its the wright direction to go in either. üòÜ

[27-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Markus#5464
but

[27-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Markus#5464
why any of those when we have kmd? üòÑ

[27-Feb-19 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well KMD still needs a very secure chain to notarize to soooo

[27-Feb-19 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise you trusting 64 notary nodes that easy mine to secure all teh chains notarized to it...

[27-Feb-19 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
KMD is a great idea and recycles a lot of wasted energy but without that energy being used in the first place.... Not sure it can function so good.

[27-Feb-19 02:02 AM] Markus#5464
what would happen if btc go PoS like eth

[27-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Markus#5464
the chance is not very big but if we play with the idea

[27-Feb-19 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as long as the stake was distibuted well enough it would be ok...

[27-Feb-19 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think... like it depends... PoS has other problems... I think maybe if BTC was to die, we could notarize to Verus LOL .... the currently notarize to us haha

[27-Feb-19 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That said I dont think BTC will actually die.. maybe not moon to some insane value, but its not goign to die.

[27-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Markus#5464
What about Eth after PoS upgrade, better or worse?

[27-Feb-19 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dont know ernough about it to say

[27-Feb-19 02:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
There devs and traders here with larger bags than yours @Likewise. This isn‚Äôt a pissing contest. I appreciate your insight but this isn‚Äôt forex and talking down to those who have been in the crypto game from the start is kind of obnoxious imo.

[27-Feb-19 02:11 AM] Likewise#6767
not talking down but when devs and other insiders dump on their "kids" I find it laughable that those "kids" dont seem to realize that and keep on thinking they are going to come out winning.

[27-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
@Likewise I believe Ver was justified fighting against core

[27-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
Wright just seems to do it for the sake of doing it

[27-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419

[27-Feb-19 02:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thankfully it seems to have turned into a race to foster adoption as opposed to a hash war.

[27-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Likewise#6767
The whole crypto show left a bad taste with many. Remember the stories about guys getting loans to buy crypto back in 2017, the 2018 dip buyers.......the 2019.....

[27-Feb-19 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lots of ppl got totally rekt 2017/2018 ... but tbh a lot of those ppl were pretty stupid

[27-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Likewise#6767
Also guys I trade with, since last year have been following and wathcign PA, they are far from impressed and TBH the RR is way better in tradional markets so they have lkost the bit of interst they had

[27-Feb-19 02:23 AM] Likewise#6767
sure, stupid because of listening to all them crypto fairytales

[27-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Likewise#6767
so there is me left in my per group lol, just telling this to show the younge crowd that the majority of my age group has little to no interest in it. Just me and a few other lost old sould I guess

[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Likewise#6767
Of cours the :influencers" will tell you differently but I just say what I see among my peers.

[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
when everyone is telling you to buy you sell.... This is pretty basic stuff

[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Likewise#6767
as 10K was the last time or 8K was it lol

[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My mum got rekt... I told her to get out in december 2017 about 25 times... she refused and lost everything

[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Markus#5464
but price is "cheap" now, they say that we should buy so now we sell? :troll_king:

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Likewise#6767
what is cheap or expensive üòâ

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well a few days ago... it was all moon charts ... everyone bullish then massive red dildo

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Likewise#6767
it is how the market defines it and it is obvious that nobody wants to pay high BTC prices, see PA

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
seems to be pretty easy to predict to me

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Likewise#6767
sure, as usual

[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
I thought for sure buying bch before the fork war was a no brainer. Still waiting to recoup on that one.

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Likewise#6767
yes but in that case as I said you are much better of tradign SPX500 th RR is way better the nwaiting for an pump/dump

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
or... crazy idea

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Alright#0419
use it as money

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
buying BTC before the BCH fork was a no brainer...

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any fork after that ... nope

[27-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Likewise#6767
if some here really got the trading skills they say they should really trade SPX500 and other indicves on leverage and make some reall money

[27-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Markus#5464
problem for me is opening hours of traditional stocks, in crypto its 24/7

[27-Feb-19 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dontr trade ... but I did move some things around in mid 2017 that turned out to be vbery profitable.

[27-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Likewise#6767
u dont need to sit and watch it all day ;0

[27-Feb-19 02:30 AM] Alright#0419
knowing next to nothing about traditional markets, i find it pretty comical that they close for the day in 2019

[27-Feb-19 02:31 AM] Markus#5464
even more annoying is weekends not open at all

[27-Feb-19 02:33 AM] Likewise#6767
