not sure if you can even model something like that with predictive capabilities that are right enough of the times to be profitable

[02-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and if you are able to do so, let me know, I can probably get you a couple of 6-7 figure/year jobs easy 😄

[02-Jul-19 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
😄 haha

[02-Jul-19 09:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
https://vsysrate.com looks like the coin is controlled by asian exchanges

[02-Jul-19 09:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Good old Peercoin days

[02-Jul-19 09:55 AM] alen#3721
@hyperDEX im one of those who are not sellinf btc ar 20k...i didnt do it im 2017 and wont do it now either

[02-Jul-19 09:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That was my mistake in 2017, need to take some profits then you dont have to sell during the bear

[02-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I already took some out

[02-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Already have points in mind where I will do it again

[02-Jul-19 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
going to take jl's advice to heart and sell on the way up :p

[02-Jul-19 09:58 AM] alen#3721
We were all greedy thinking it will go higher..bit we remained cool and strong during bear and didnt sell..actually i bought 1 more when it was 4k

[02-Jul-19 10:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
i had 0 dry power to buy with.....so i think always have some in reserve

[02-Jul-19 10:01 AM] cascrypto#8206
Same here hyper

[02-Jul-19 10:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone take notes and remind us when the bull comes 😄

[02-Jul-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
dont forget to sell at the ATH!

[02-Jul-19 10:02 AM] alen#3721
How do u know i it will be ATH

[02-Jul-19 10:02 AM] cascrypto#8206
He has a graph

[02-Jul-19 10:02 AM] cascrypto#8206
With no noise

[02-Jul-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
best way is to use tachyons and get a message from the future

[02-Jul-19 10:04 AM] alen#3721
Im selling when im satisfied with the price...and even then i will sell only 1/4 of portfolio

[02-Jul-19 10:04 AM] alen#3721
I have a plan to leave to my 2 kids each gets 1 btc..have no idea if it will be worth anyithing but still

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c what happened to your kmd graph ? 😛

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
that server died

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
buy under the line, sell above

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
oh ok

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, buying when it is below the line and curving up

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
sell when it is above and curving down.

[02-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
that worked most of the time

[02-Jul-19 10:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
can we bring that server back to life?

[02-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
will need to update the code too

[02-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i will think on it

[02-Jul-19 10:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[02-Jul-19 10:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
had to look what what Tachyons were

[02-Jul-19 10:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
learned something today

[02-Jul-19 10:37 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Normally, a good exit strategy is to sell when multiple parabolic rise channels get broken

[02-Jul-19 10:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tachyons don’t exist

wow! Yes MAXCOIN! ... lol.. even made a ceremony out of creating the genesis block  on his show

[02-Jul-19 11:02 AM] LocoMB#8593
total whack job- but he did a good job railing against Wall Street and trying to crash fiat by shilling silver - a long time ago

[02-Jul-19 11:03 AM] LocoMB#8593
these days he is shilling for DASH, EOS and such things

[02-Jul-19 11:04 AM] LocoMB#8593
I wonder if he just went total loony or if he just needs the money

[02-Jul-19 11:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
what happened to his coin?

[02-Jul-19 11:04 AM] Markus#5464
bitcoin is mad

[02-Jul-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586

maxcoin used to be up there with BTCD

[02-Jul-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
on CMC

[02-Jul-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
people dont seem to realize how good a result it is to be able to maintain the #50 spot on CMC, with daily new hype coins being released

[02-Jul-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, much better to rise higher, but just maintaining against the constant stream of new projects, that is still quite good.

[02-Jul-19 11:08 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c how low u think BTC will go?

[02-Jul-19 11:08 AM] LocoMB#8593
oh well - Maxcoin was always just meant to be an art project, so excessive trolling about this would be inapproriate

[02-Jul-19 11:09 AM] LocoMB#8593
@Markus have you already consulted your other crystal balls?

[02-Jul-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus just watch and as long as it is going lower, odds are it will keep going lower still

[02-Jul-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
inertia, it goes on longer than seems reasonable. you might get your retrace to $6100 after all, then again it could reverse and go to $15k

[02-Jul-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
when a single trader can make a $200 mil short and then move the market, the question is more, will there be a $300 mil long trader or not

[02-Jul-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
impossible to predict when individuals can affect the outcome, just like psychohistory

[02-Jul-19 11:11 AM] Markus#5464
well my 6k hopes were when it was 8-9k before going parabolic up to 14k....but sure it can yet go to 6-7k lvls even lower who knows rly

[02-Jul-19 11:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Max Keiser is a clown, you dont take clowns seriously

[02-Jul-19 11:13 AM] Markus#5464

crypto volume overall is not rly that huge....if u would delete all stable coins volume would quickly dry up
