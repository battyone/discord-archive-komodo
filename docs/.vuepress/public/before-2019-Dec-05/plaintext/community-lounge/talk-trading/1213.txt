@siu - Chainmakers I think a desktop app would put more liquidity on the Dex and the bridge the cex

[17-Nov-19 07:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
The upswing does look very fragile

[17-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You will have liquidity provider apps for mm2.0 üôÇ

[17-Nov-19 08:03 PM] Markus#5464
on weekly yea but dont know how big deal it is üòõ

[17-Nov-19 08:03 PM] Markus#5464
if they want to pump they will then resistance doesnt rly matter

[17-Nov-19 08:03 PM] blubbi#0643

[17-Nov-19 08:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well i has been all slow gains up till now, no real mega candles

[17-Nov-19 08:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hasnt yet really felt like big time fomo buying either, right??

[17-Nov-19 08:04 PM] blubbi#0643
neither big volume

[17-Nov-19 08:04 PM] CoinKing88#1540
1  big buy and we are at 20k sats, orderbook is not that big

[17-Nov-19 08:04 PM] blubbi#0643

[17-Nov-19 08:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
50 btc up till 20K sats

[17-Nov-19 08:05 PM] Markus#5464
hopefully we dont dump too hard when deposits get enabled on binance üòõ

[17-Nov-19 08:06 PM] blubbi#0643

[17-Nov-19 08:09 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Markus Dont think so, KMD is listed at enough large exchanges. A (mini) whale is still able to sell pretty easy at bithump, huobi, bittrex etc etc.

[17-Nov-19 08:09 PM] CoinKing88#1540
As i am typing, there is the red candle üòÑ

[17-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Markus#5464
its expected that there will be pullbacks but looking at the rally last 3 weeks every dip gets bought up

[17-Nov-19 08:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
New weekly candle will require quick pullback for support

[17-Nov-19 08:12 PM] jspook16#3059
Pamp is over..

[17-Nov-19 08:13 PM] Markus#5464
@jspook16 u been saying that for 2 weeks, just like how Caglio used to be few months ago

[17-Nov-19 08:13 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@jspook16 almost nothing in the orderbook until 12800 again

Hey, y'all. Anyone in the US using VPN to trade og binance? Does it work well?

[17-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Potato Guy 9000#2499

Whatever is left in the tard bucket should be eyed closely come next bull run

[17-Nov-19 11:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tard bucket = coins that are allowed on USSA-approved exchanges

[17-Nov-19 11:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Majority of tards won‚Äôt be VPNing anything

How long have binance deposits been disabled fore?

[18-Nov-19 03:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Trex would have to offshore, kill KYC, and trade ARRR to regain any street creed with me

[18-Nov-19 06:04 AM] Privatoshi#9487
For me, Trex would have to have deposited 1 BTC in my account, with a personalized dashboard, no fees for life & list Hush, ARRR , Verus , Utrum & Labs...and kUSD & KMDice

[18-Nov-19 06:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Trex stopped new markets for US traders, starting with DragonChain.

[18-Nov-19 06:06 AM] Privatoshi#9487
Even Binance doesn't enforce the non-US trader policy. I'd trade on Beaxy before Trex üòÇ

like Ark and Stratis were projects that I also liked and followed a bit. Seeing where they are now.. rank 143 and rank 110.. Komodo has done great if you look at it objectively

[18-Nov-19 12:48 PM] Neko#5830
komodo proves satoshi got a lot more right than people like vitalik think, look what unstable mess eth is

[18-Nov-19 12:48 PM] crumb#2550
wasn't stratis like a top15 coin? once upon a time...

[18-Nov-19 12:48 PM] Neko#5830
it was

[18-Nov-19 12:48 PM] crumb#2550
or top10 even

[18-Nov-19 12:49 PM] crumb#2550
how are they doing tech wise, haven't followed them for a long time

[18-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Malti#3948
stratis used to be the most succesful (in terms of ROI) ico ever

[18-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Malti#3948
ark used to be top 30

[18-Nov-19 12:54 PM] Malti#3948
tech wise, idk. dropped out of their discord a while ago

[18-Nov-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to be 1 STRAT == 10 KMD

[18-Nov-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
now 1 KMD == 3 STRAT, so a 30x difference

[18-Nov-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i keep saying this, but most people dont realize how positive it is that KMD has held onto top 50 CMC as there are so many new projects, stablecoins, etc. that arrive over the years. just staying at the same rank is quite a difficult task that few coins have done.

pulling back to get parachute

[18-Nov-19 04:28 PM] richardt#2807
Deposits opening soon. People likely getting ready

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] Malti#3948
how do you know the deposits are opening soon?

[18-Nov-19 04:39 PM] tolken#2655
Dump, baby.

[18-Nov-19 04:42 PM] Malti#3948
as long as we stay above 11k and even 10k I wouldn't call this a dump

[18-Nov-19 04:55 PM] FreakBros#8449
Could be wrong but I'm waiting on the bittrex wallet to go into maintenance mode as an indicator that were getting close to all exchange wallets going live again

[18-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ah bittrex is still open?

[18-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I cant imagine big accounts not having an account on bittrex to offload a bit

[18-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was one of the few big exchanges for a long while for kmd

[18-Nov-19 05:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
before binance in december 2017
