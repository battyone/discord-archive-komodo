the polymers are better, but the principle techniques are still the same

zadexx sounds kind of kinky

[19-Mar-19 05:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[19-Mar-19 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I wasn't aware it was redfox behind it

[19-Mar-19 05:20 PM] PTYX#6840

Urban Dictionary: Sadist
One who gets pleasure (often sexual) from the suffering of others. It is a common myth that sadists like masochists, however the true sadist can get no pleasure from the pain he causes the masochist because the masochist is enjoying it.

WTB JUMBLR, DEX or REVS assets

[19-Mar-19 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@digital bullion I think @Acura might be selling some DEX

[19-Mar-19 06:51 PM] Acura#2748
Yes - but i think i will no more selling the DEX Asset - because it will massively growth in the future

HODLing has become a way of life for me- I have bags of a dozen+ James assets dating from way back in 2014 ... 🎭
I'll be damned if I dump these carelessly

[19-Mar-19 06:55 PM] jorian#4555
WTS DEX @ 25 KMD each

[19-Mar-19 07:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll sell some @ 26KMD each

[19-Mar-19 07:12 PM] Acura#2748
2017 end of the year i had seen Dex Price of 58KMD 😎

[19-Mar-19 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hehe yeah right before the launch of hyperdex it was trading at 34kmd a short time

what is DEX coin?

[19-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Markus#5464
use case? why worth so much?

[19-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jorian#4555
great questions

[19-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jorian#4555

Pays fee to holders

[19-Mar-19 07:25 PM] jorian#4555
jk

[19-Mar-19 07:26 PM] jorian#4555
it indeed pays the fees of barterdex trades

[19-Mar-19 07:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Having an equivalent volume to stex, would net quarterly fee payments

[19-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Markus#5464
Alright cool

[19-Mar-19 07:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just a napkin estimate

[19-Mar-19 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its simple, every $777 million of mm2 volume will generate $1 mil of dexfee, half going to DEX, the rest to the other assets and GUI devs. It seems a large amount but exchanges like exmo ( a bit bigger than yobit) do that much volume every month

[19-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now imagine a lot of projects adopting the marketmaker and paying fees in a network of dex's

[19-Mar-19 07:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And then 777M$ a month doesnt even sound that farfetched

@Acura your hopium about the DEX could be well-placed after the barterdex 2.0

@FishyGuts hah, definitely introductions should be nice 😃 Anyway, good work RFL

[20-Mar-19 06:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Bitcoin Benny aren't you on this RedFox train?

[20-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(sorry not that familiar with the current Komodo celebrities)

[20-Mar-19 06:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes, you are correct.

[20-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
afaik, RFL is like the Komodo Accelerator/Incubator, right?

Probably the most important 2 weeks for #Bitcoin in the last months. Facing the yearly downtrend channel resistance.

Do or die.

It would be good, because Ethereum people have plenty of choice when it comes to accelerators.

[20-Mar-19 08:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Too bad I am not the right candidate for such things, because my slides are awkward and my plans are outrageous and chaotic.

[20-Mar-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The first design of slides is never a good one

[20-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Keep tweaking and taking feedback into consideration

[20-Mar-19 08:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Most important thing is to tell a story to the audience, slides should be there to support with for example images etc, but not too much text let alone new info that you dont mention in your speech

[20-Mar-19 08:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tell a story with start and ending, use examples to keep it light and understandable for the audience
