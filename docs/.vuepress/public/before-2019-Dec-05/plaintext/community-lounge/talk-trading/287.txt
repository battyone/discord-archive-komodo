I'm still waiting for just the right moment to let loose `!kmdtip shitstorm`.

It¬¥s hard...Almost like me playing poker last weekend. I was drunk and I had double cards on my hands.

[19-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Many months ago I said I'd buy more at 25 cents each when it got there

[19-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
people laughed.. now at 25 cents im not sure i can even make myself buy

[19-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Sdunbar#5064
5 cents i'll do it though just for the sake of doing it

[19-Nov-18 01:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[19-Nov-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what if we hit 4900

[19-Nov-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
then ETF news hits

[19-Nov-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[19-Nov-18 01:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362

kmd $100 is not impossible imo

[19-Nov-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, i'm loaded in case a catastrophic event happens
choose wisely üòâ

[19-Nov-18 01:53 PM] dokrates#8987
kmd 100$ could be huge

[19-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
only 11.5billion mcap

[19-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
with current circulating supply

[19-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or was that closer to 100m circulating

[19-Nov-18 01:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
doesnt matter

[19-Nov-18 01:56 PM] dokrates#8987
it is 10 times past ath right?

[19-Nov-18 02:03 PM] BlockTech#6895
around 7 times, it reached 15$ a few minutes.

[19-Nov-18 02:04 PM] BlockTech#6895
I was so excited, looking at my portfolio, bought at 7$. was already at 15$ HODL, and look where i am now, an amazing 0,7$ üòÇ

[19-Nov-18 02:06 PM] BlockTech#6895
I won't sell before 30$, exepted if it's a "Pump".

[19-Nov-18 02:11 PM] dokrates#8987
15k sat is a good price i think

[19-Nov-18 02:11 PM] dokrates#8987
im happy buying at this level

[19-Nov-18 02:19 PM] BlockTech#6895
I can't understand who is selling those amount (wall being slowly eaten on binance) at 15k sat.

[19-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Lieutenant#1428
btc 4900$ = kmd 12k-13k sat

[19-Nov-18 02:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm ready for the incoming ice age üò∑

[19-Nov-18 02:22 PM] dokrates#8987
why those math?

[19-Nov-18 02:23 PM] dokrates#8987
@Lieutenant why 4900$ = 12-13k sat ?

[19-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I don't understand how you can predict a bottom at this point

[19-Nov-18 02:34 PM] BlockTech#6895
I personnally think, the wall will hold us above 15k sat. (exept if he removes it.)

[19-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Sdunbar#5064
i dont think there is any bottom

[19-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Sdunbar#5064
well zero is bottom

[19-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Sdunbar#5064
effective zero like maybe there will be a price but no buyers

[19-Nov-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wall is 'only' 20btc

[19-Nov-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not that much

[19-Nov-18 02:43 PM] Sdunbar#5064
not that much at the current BTC price :p

[19-Nov-18 02:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
at the same time only 6BTC marketbuy needed to get to 17k

[19-Nov-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Prices falling on low volume also means not that many people actually selling

[19-Nov-18 02:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is good

[19-Nov-18 02:45 PM] BlockTech#6895
I'm pretty sure, most of the dumping is bot pushing the price down

[19-Nov-18 02:45 PM] Lumbi#8378

What satoshi price did this coin ICO at?

[19-Nov-18 02:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Why is it not possible for a 100 dollar KMD?

[19-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
who says its not possible?

[19-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think above most said it was very possible

[19-Nov-18 03:34 PM] ryman112#0068
@Phba2061

[19-Nov-18 03:35 PM] ryman112#0068
He said its not possible in his opinion.  I was asking why he thought that

[19-Nov-18 03:35 PM] dokrates#8987
yes, but 100$ maybe within next 2 years

[19-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
aaah

[19-Nov-18 03:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
my bad

[19-Nov-18 03:37 PM] ryman112#0068
No worries

[19-Nov-18 03:37 PM] ryman112#0068
I believe we have more potential than 100 dollars here

[19-Nov-18 03:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
We might need to see other projects die before that happens.   I don't know anything, but it seems like we need a quarter or more of the top 100 projects to just go ahead and die.
