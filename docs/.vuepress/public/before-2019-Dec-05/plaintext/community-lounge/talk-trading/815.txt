if btc will rally to 40k to me that means rektening of alt have not even begun yet

@jl777c what if BTC really breaks past 13K ?

[22-Jun-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus depends on how it gets there

[22-Jun-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
totally depends on if it "rests" for a week here and there

[22-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and especially the 10% to 15% corrections that last more than a few hours

[22-Jun-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if it just keeps gaining 10% per day until it hits 40K, then yes, BTC dominance would be 77.7%

[22-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Markus#5464
well i hope so, kmd need to get back up to 20k this is not healthy

[22-Jun-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this defense of 11k seems an important battle. would be much better for price to retest 10k and make sure it is strong support

[22-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Markus#5464
-45% in 11 days

[22-Jun-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a bull run

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Dont whine about that please, you had a option to sell for BTC if you wanted too. You choose to hodl en hope for gains in sat and it backfired

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Deal with it

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Tek#5253
the shorters trying to keep it down lol

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Tek#5253
I wonder if tone vays added to his shorts

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC volumes double normal

[22-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
@CoinKing88 i didnt get rekt i just recently bought into kmd so no significant loss yet

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess at BTC dominance, if it really get past 70%, KMD price will hit hard by bots adjusting it's price against fait money ðŸ¤”

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
does anybody track fiat flows, is this actually fiat coming in, or just USDT

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I need moar BTC!!! :troll_hmm:

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c i think its both

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Tek#5253
but no proofs

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i remember seeing a site that somehow tracked that

[22-Jun-19 09:54 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Just wait it out, most alts will recover. KMD has done well lately so i expect it to recover well above average

in Polo days ( _wen polo?_ ) I tried, long and shorts there.
it was fun, until it wasn't.
Only tried to learn what the heck this whole thing was.
Learned that the same old way of mine which I trust is just study the damn project, understand and do long term holding than this heart attack kinda shorts/long trading ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 09:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was nice little lesson.

[22-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Tek#5253

;d

[22-Jun-19 10:13 AM] Markus#5464
Yea i think blockchain devs will be really attractive upcoming years when more and more want to get into blockchain

[22-Jun-19 10:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
actually blockchain tech developers who really understand the underlying tech will be a lot valuable to industry than the dApp developers.

[22-Jun-19 10:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are many dApp devs popping up. But it's the core devs which are scarce. VERY VERY Scarce.

[22-Jun-19 10:17 AM] Markus#5464
ofc, most of the dapp devs are just there for the money not the tech

[22-Jun-19 10:21 AM] Markus#5464
did u start learning how blockchain works from kmd?

[22-Jun-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
Thats pretty awesome

[22-Jun-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
great story

[22-Jun-19 10:26 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
rip KMD satoshi value

[22-Jun-19 10:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[22-Jun-19 10:27 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I'm shooting for 2500 sats

[22-Jun-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
I think its time to hide my stack of kmd for a while and forget it

[22-Jun-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
will get depressing to look at it ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 10:28 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea I will HODL on maybe check back in 2 years

[22-Jun-19 10:28 AM] Markus#5464
and then u get back and its even more rekt ðŸ˜„

[22-Jun-19 10:29 AM] Markus#5464
1k sats and btc price being 200k :troll_lol:

[22-Jun-19 10:29 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea 500 sats

[22-Jun-19 10:30 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
1k sats is $2 at 200k so lol sounds about right

[22-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
that would not be such a great performance

[22-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
1.4$ to 2$ in 2 years

[22-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Flint#6435
it is strange that on the background of hacking a purse the price has grown and now there is a big drain on the price! why such a dump - it panic sales to buy Bitcoin? But we broke through several levels of the bottom (((

[22-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
ye ppl sell for btc

[22-Jun-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
fomo

[22-Jun-19 10:32 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
the KMD btc chart looks no where near a reversal .... kmb/btc looks ugly

[22-Jun-19 10:32 AM] Flint#6435
but important annual levels are broken down

[22-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
well we are heavily oversold now....even on daily

[22-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
so bounce could be explosive

[22-Jun-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a massive 10BTC for sale below 15k

[22-Jun-19 10:33 AM] Flint#6435
Perhaps I will use this chance and buy more while everyone is selling!))

[22-Jun-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
10BTC isnt quite everybody selling, just a few is enough to change the price that is displayed

[22-Jun-19 10:34 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I wish I had more dry powder, bought a lot at 17k sats

[22-Jun-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
which is 18 BTC away

[22-Jun-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
when this turns, these low prices will be snapped up very fast

[22-Jun-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
i bought most at 14k and 15k

[22-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Flint#6435
Where is our minimum bottom according to you? paired with the dollar, everything is fine - and a bitcoin is a mystery
