I'm really not much into trading and TA, but that triangle makes obvious a large move is close and I've seen many repeating the same

@siu - Chainmakers looks ready to go, but also looks like 2014 bulltrap all over again rsi and macd in same setup. I have hope that we will bounce off the longer time trendline since 2012, might as well crash down again to 200weekly MA as it did before https://www.tradingview.com/x/zo4wJAv5/

imagine getting more kmd at 0.5$ :abusedsmily:

[20-Oct-18 09:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That can happen too

[20-Oct-18 09:20 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@kmdwhale please pump to 100k sats, we all exit the market and comeback in 6 months :>

[20-Oct-18 09:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
btw I assume even whales play with only 5% or their portfolio. So by this his pockets are ~30mio deep. Does anyone know this to be true? Anyone ever playeds with/known whales, do they go all in?

@bpkdasbaum  I think he is setting up the stage for christmas time when everyone is on vacation and wants to play.

[20-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Alice#9607
Whales certainly do not go all in at this stage.

[20-Oct-18 10:26 PM] Alice#9607
If you look at the KMD chart it is a low risk entry point now.

[20-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Llama#1330
or maybe its a palm beach whale buying before they tell everyone else to buy up to $10

Come on KMD I need to buy 157 more go down a bit.

[21-Oct-18 01:27 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Question: could a whale sell to himself on binance? making it appear as if there is more buy volume than it is in reallity?

[21-Oct-18 01:55 AM] bishop#9773
Sure

[21-Oct-18 04:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
Compared to gold and silver manipulation. Kmd is childs play. Crypto is only in its speculative phase. This market is only 100% manipulation and hype

[21-Oct-18 05:10 AM] actionslacks#4072

[21-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if the whale has found a way to manipulate bots with the way hes placing the orders etc

[21-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And to be able to buy large amounts without pumping price

@bpkdasbaum I think this whale pockets are lot deeper than 30 million since i think its same guy that has bought over 7 million kmd from begin of january during this bear market.

Bitcoin rising again, reaching 6550$ again on CMC, let's hope it keep getting that way and not a dump to 6k$ =D.

@BlockTech volume has turned to dust on Binance

[21-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
is this USD or USDT?

[21-Oct-18 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think average

[21-Oct-18 10:59 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also $100 is not something to write home about

[21-Oct-18 11:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Bitmex still $6,440.50

[21-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
seems bitmex might be the most "real" of all these prices?

[21-Oct-18 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
CB has price":"6436.75000000"

[21-Oct-18 11:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah seems like USD spot is at a discount to fakeusd spot

Also Bitfinex is losing lots and lots of volume, was 21st yesterday now in the 30s. They were top 5 from memory for a long time

No that wouldnt be the cause as i am pretty sure i saw the volume change only in the last week.

[21-Oct-18 11:55 AM] Acura#2748
ok

[21-Oct-18 11:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe tether fud really killed off the big volume players

[21-Oct-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
tether implosion could take down bitfinex

nobody knows as the exact details of tether, bitfinex corporate structures, funds on deposit, etc. are all based on trust in bitfinex

finally he discovers it and 154K KMD! also doing some payments to some other addresses

[21-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
seems pretty unlikely this is any binance cold wallet @hyperDEX

[21-Oct-18 12:14 PM] snowdamn#2414
i have no skin in the game when it comes to USDT, but wasn't there an audit/confirmation from 3rd party of fiat reserves recently?

[21-Oct-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[21-Oct-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
auditor did quit though

[21-Oct-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or was fired

[21-Oct-18 12:15 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I knew it was a matter of time before he claimed it. No way he was going to let that be a miner reward.

We will be moving some funds between our cold wallets. A tell tale sign of a new cold wallet on Binance is two small transfers from and BACK TO an existing wallet, then a large transaction. No need to be alarmed. Funds are #SAFU.

[21-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I'm going with no cold storage for the time being. Someone knows they can make some serious bank on the interest alone when KMD hits 100 dollars.

You know how you hit the claim button in Agama and for 1 block your wallet shows 0 funds? I bet he was sweating bullets during that one block.

what is the meaning of cold storage? if someone accidently guess your key does it matter it's cold storage or hot storage? he just got the access right ?

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is it a problem for crypto that it is "too virtual" ?

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
once you do a tx, it isnt cold anymore

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
too liquid

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the pubkey is known

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so the proper procedure is to send all funds to a new cold address

[21-Oct-18 12:34 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
you can try to guess private key from public ?

[21-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
no, but QC has efficient ways to calculate from it

[21-Oct-18 12:35 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so cold address = never send outgoing ?

[21-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
when it is cold, then it is only known a hash of hash, which QC has no significant advantage over random guessing

[21-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if you ever make a spend, you need to disclose the pubkey to do the spend

[21-Oct-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and then it isnt cold anymore

[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so we can 100% say that the RD7SZpgtfrLXB32bRcckYaVmre2ByL73Pi is not any binance cold storage

[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so zksnarks also have advantage here ?
