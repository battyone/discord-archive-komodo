[14-Jun-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Weren‚Äôt they going to do an airdrop for 50% of the tokens?

[14-Jun-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Or was that PRL?

[14-Jun-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Dont remember but one of the tokens was mostly airdorp

[14-Jun-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> airdrop*

[14-Jun-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> Not sure tbh

[14-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> im open to free airdrops though

[14-Jun-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> ChainZilla will be making an airdrop after we deliver our first app

[14-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Airdrop to...

[14-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> I will most likely make 2-3 airdrops and a small ICO but I need to workout the scheme to minimize cheating and reward kmd users

[14-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Kmd?

[14-Jun-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> It will be a mix between sign ups and KMD users

[14-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> alright cool

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> bounce bounce bounce bounce

[14-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> Has there been any more interest from projects regarding DPOW @PTYX?

[14-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Yes

[14-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Guardian which is a conservation project chose Komodo due to the DPoW and flexibility of the chain.

[14-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> fantastic, Glad its getting some traction

[14-Jun-18 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> They will go online in the coming months and they plan to ico in December. It's a very diferent project though since it involves land tokenization and also contracts to protect the trees within the property

[14-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> sounds interesting, look forward to hearing more

[14-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> I look forward to telling moreüòÄ

[14-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> lol keep it coming then

[14-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> what other little bits of news do you know about hehe

[14-Jun-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> We are stake holders in Abee Ride which us a decentralized Uber that will launch in the coming months. We almost went with Komodo but chainzilla wasn't ready at that time so he will use erc20 for the funding round

[14-Jun-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Maybe I can convince him to migrate later

[14-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> They are working closely with Dash. Actually sponsored by dash

[14-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> shame on the erc20 but yeah hopefully you can migrate them

[14-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Yes it's OK. Lots of interesting projects are coming

[14-Jun-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> dash have sponsored alot recently

[14-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> I wanted to make sure our legal structure was ready before we take on any icos

[14-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> Dead cat bounce today?

[14-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> Looks it

[14-Jun-18 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> Wish you the best with chainzilla üëç

[14-Jun-18 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CryptoNinjaa> komodo eats dead cats

[14-Jun-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> Bounce from lower weekly bb should be no joke

[14-Jun-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> when this ends?

[14-Jun-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> when moon?

[14-Jun-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> üöó ‚ùî

[14-Jun-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> Yeah, we‚Äôre supposed to be at 800k sats

[14-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> What the fuck are we still fucking around with in the 20k‚Äôs?

[14-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> Get your shit together

[14-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> :smiley_abused:

[14-Jun-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jeezy> needed to unload some at 33-35 actually, lets  make 20k great again!

[14-Jun-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Blocktech> We just got from rank 61 to 60 on CMC ^^. And are battling with 30k.

[14-Jun-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> Bounce from here should take us to weekly 20sma at least

[14-Jun-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> bollinger tweeted about a bb squeeze forming for btc

[14-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> should be pretty violent as well

[14-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> is it a bit more stable now?

[14-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> in comparison to 2014?

[14-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> maybe because other actors are jumping in?

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> Depends if you think Tether is willybot 2.0, but personally I don't think the 2014 repeat narrative is appropriate

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> So much has changed since then

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jeezy> 4.8-5.2 sounds realistic

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> Millions of new market entrants, huge tech maturity

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jeezy> CT  "pros"  seem more or less  confident

[14-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> 5k has the classic 'too many people expect it' problem

[14-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> I would expect it to break or not touch, a bounce exactly in that range seems unlikely

[14-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jeezy> you think we bounce from 5.8?

[14-Jun-18 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> People change, market cycles dont

[14-Jun-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> I guess we can only hodl, wait and see.

[14-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> As these predictions become more and more accurate every cycle, people will begin being better prepared for the next one, reducing its effect.

[14-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> 5k is what a lot expect, so expect 4k

[14-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> there will be chaos if everyone expects 5k and it still goes lower

[14-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> Tell me more.

[14-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <emmanux> What kind of chaos?

[14-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> figuratively. like you said everyone thinks 5k so it will be 5k. but what if it goes lower? all those people expected 5k, so BTC permaded?

[14-Jun-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> If a lot of people expect 5k wont they start buying before?

[14-Jun-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> So we wont see 4k?

[14-Jun-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> i don't know, i'm just blurting out shit üòõ

[14-Jun-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> we're gonna have to wait and see

[14-Jun-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> but there certainly are similarities with 2014

[slack] <jorian> 'in het verleden behaalde resultaten bieden geen garantie voor de toekomst' üòõ

[14-Jun-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Blocktech> It never stop where people expect it. i think it will stop at 7k

[14-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> I think we are going to pump to 30k

[14-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> The target everyone expect is normally missrd

[14-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
