@jl777c you are great at naming things, got a suggestion

[24-Jun-19 11:03 AM] jansako#3330
You always got things like "Pokermaster", Poker Unlimited

[24-Jun-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
how about just "CHIPS GUI"

[24-Jun-19 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
chips is a pretty good name

[24-Jun-19 11:05 AM] jansako#3330
it is, if you have a substantial marketing budget...

[24-Jun-19 11:11 AM] jansako#3330
What is the most important selling point? Maybe that needs to be in the name?

[24-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe lightning chips, would tap into a new market segment

lightning poker is a ripoff of lightning roulette

[24-Jun-19 11:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Lightning Chips is the front runner

[24-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But can also use it for blackjack etc

[24-Jun-19 11:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah im thinking of that too.

[24-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm debating whether having something crypto related in the name would be a + or -

[24-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Will it throw people off or attract more people?

[24-Jun-19 11:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
