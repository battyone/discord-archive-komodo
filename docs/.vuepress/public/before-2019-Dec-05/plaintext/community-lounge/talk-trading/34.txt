[29-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Lumbi#8378
KMD is the best currency on barterDEX.. makes trades flow

[29-Jun-18 05:50 PM] 12thandgrantco#3354
I have a balance in my LTC wallet that I want to send to my ledger but it says 0 balance when I click the send tab. Anyone know why?

[29-Jun-18 05:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It would be extremely helpful, to themselves and others, if people would stop posting random questions in channels that render those questions off-topic

[29-Jun-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
BarterDEX GUI app help is in #dev-tradebots

[29-Jun-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
So, other than test coins, are there any ETOMIC markets to trade straight across (i.e., not using it as a proxy, but giving it value)?

[29-Jun-18 06:21 PM] ryman112#0068
Dunno I'm one of those weird guys that uses it a a proxy but doesn't give it value🙃

[29-Jun-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I meant, specifically, a currency value 😜

[29-Jun-18 08:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD/etomic

[29-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Etomic valued at $5.44

[29-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Per blockfolio

[29-Jun-18 08:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So

[29-Jun-18 08:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Can we dump to 5k already so we can start fuelling for moon again

💯 

[29-Jun-18 08:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean this is boring as fuck

[29-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Jazzy#0001
In this market a bottom is going to look like capitulation

[29-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Jazzy#0001
I wouldn't expect a sudden dump and following reversal

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Jazzy#0001
We have to find the bottom, then find resistance, and then get the volume to breakout

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Jazzy#0001
Could be a while, I've mentally prepared to buckle in

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Jazzy#0001
And it's a great time to cost average in more btc

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Tyrael#0138
could be something brewing, i don't like the connection of Brock pierce with Tether and EOS

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I see cryptotwitter capitulating for a while now tbh

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Jazzy#0001
People are definitely starting to

[29-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Tyrael#0138
including this shit centralizing crap

[29-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hell it’s almost starting to get to me as I’m becoming annoyed by retards even more than usual

[29-Jun-18 08:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But last time we saw the reversal, I was almost contemplating selling kmd

[29-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And i would never forgive myself for selling now

[29-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So if my own despair meter is any sign

[29-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then we’re not at the bottom by a long shot

[29-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I’m caring less in general atm

[29-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And buying more

Blockfolio lists it

[29-Jun-18 10:21 PM] Bowdo#4054
The office accountant smugly asked me how my crypto was doing this week.   Don't have a good reason to think so, but it makes me feel like might have got near bottom.

[29-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Bowdo#4054
Looking forward to the next time she asks and I'm 5x in the green (again).

[29-Jun-18 10:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Should’ve asked her how the President/CEO’s dick tasted

[29-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“When the bull run reactivates, maybe you’ll be lucky enough to taste mine”

[29-Jun-18 10:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Make sure you have alternate means of income though

[29-Jun-18 10:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

This one is even more beautiful than the Bubble Phase patterns on $BTC. 

Pretty strong here and many of the $STRAT holders are so depressed, while the team is seemingly working hard. 

Beautiful.
