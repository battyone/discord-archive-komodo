how do we prevent something like this from happening again

[09-Jun-19 05:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
No shitty closed source modules

[09-Jun-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
there was source code to it

[09-Jun-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
just the binary didnt have to match the sourcecode

[09-Jun-19 05:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
To not dependent TOO MUCH on dependencies and code your code as much possible as you can, and review the imported code thoroughly, and also in case you really do depend on the dependencies lock the version number of the dependency to NOT auto upgrade to latest without a review.

[09-Jun-19 05:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The best security practices MUST be followed by the devs who build the applications.

[09-Jun-19 05:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
No matter which programming language one uses, there are practices which help. from C to any other modern language all are like getting reusable code from other places via libraries, how the devs manage the security and practice their coding of software is a big thing to keep things secure and isolated it out of vulnerabilities.

[09-Jun-19 05:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
With node.js I just find it too much of work to review code of 100s of other unknown dependencies which has further of their own dependencies, and so on and on.
So, the best is to code all the those things as much possibly as you can by your own self.

[09-Jun-19 05:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but since with package manager and modern languages allow to share even a small notify feature like code, many devs just pick the 3rd party code and re-use it.

[09-Jun-19 05:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just a small example, I can't emphasise more on just code the code even if it's small just by your own self and use it.

[09-Jun-19 05:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not to depend on too much on small things on 3rd party.

[09-Jun-19 05:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
as lesser the software will need dependency on external sources at compile time the best it is.

Whales realize the difference in paying a few cents more in fiat value per coin is meaningless in the grand scheme of things. That's like arguing over buying BTC at $1 vs $2

[10-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064
1 dollar vs 2 dollars = 2x the coins bro

[10-Jun-19 12:49 AM] yorklab#7270
@bishop Agree. We're talking a penny or two, and they're not going to sell for a few sats profit. I've seen lots of those big buys now for about month. I figure if they're buying then I'm holding.

[10-Jun-19 12:50 AM] yorklab#7270
BTW, when the flash pump happened, that buy wall at 20K was still there at the time.
