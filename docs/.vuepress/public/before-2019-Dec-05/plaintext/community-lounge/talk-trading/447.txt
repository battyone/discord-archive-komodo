Does your jetski have a cupholder for your wine coolers?

[28-Feb-19 03:18 AM] Likewise#6767
it has a stand to watch graphs 24/7 completely unneeded

[28-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Likewise#6767
lets be an adult, as  Iasked others, if you really are that great a trading, bring on them results, I will bring on mine, instead if being a baby

[28-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
@Likewise that is a bot you're talking to

[28-Feb-19 03:20 AM] Alright#0419
Terry that is

[28-Feb-19 03:21 AM] Likewise#6767
cool, I like what it has to say

[28-Feb-19 03:21 AM] Likewise#6767
makes more sense then what the usual kids sprout on here

[28-Feb-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
if you really are as great at trading as you say, you should make a twitter account and make your predictions there

[28-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Alright#0419
dismissing everyone as "kids" and yet I haven't seen you make any calls yourself

[28-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Likewise#6767
No, foirst of all I dont say Imt hat great, second of all I am in no way interested in followers lol and all that shite

[28-Feb-19 03:24 AM] Likewise#6767
why would we, we make money trading no need to scam others

[28-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Likewise#6767
All I'm saying, in the adult trading world, we dont get on eacht otehs back we just show track record and basically we work together, hence why we laugh at this kindergarten here

[28-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Likewise#6767
I guess some most be really stressed watchinbg every tick, all you need is the daily close to know how much progress has been made. But yeah  I forgot, the experts here catch all bottoms and peaks lol. later kids, enjoy your new found wealth, dont forget to pay rent to mom

[28-Feb-19 03:34 AM] 74D30#6106

[28-Feb-19 12:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sharding, whatever

[28-Feb-19 12:58 PM] PHBA2061#2530
not yet I think, it is an upgrade for smooth transition from PoW to PoS

[28-Feb-19 12:59 PM] PHBA2061#2530
sharding won't be available until completed transition to PoS, if I'm not mistaken
