@Hollowman9000 hush v3 has it's own whitepaper, but there is no updated HushList whitepaper for Sapling stuff yet. SilentDragon is the proof that it works, then I will update the whitepaper. jl777-style

i would not predict anything when it comes to 2 years, if kmd gets the word spread and the big bag holders see the potential then kmd doing a eth 2.0 is not impossible

[24-Jun-19 06:07 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I've been thinking it will do an ETH move one day.... just not sure on the time frame..... prob anywhere from 2-5 years is my guess

[24-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
as KMD tech approached infinity, price approaches zero

[24-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
then after everyone sells all the KMD to me for 1 sat, I will use it to create the singularity

[24-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Oszy#5734
but at ETH tokens need ETH to work. at KMD you don't need KMD to run asset chain. why would it increase the price?

put it all on a nano s and kiester it for safe keeping

@Oszy using that logic, BTC price should never increase

[24-Jun-19 06:11 PM] Alexfrog#1338
btc price increases because its tech gets worse as core team prevents improvements and fees increase.  and price = 1/tech üòÑ

[24-Jun-19 06:12 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe LTC is a better illustration that usage alone has a fair amount of value

[24-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and people seem to use LTC a lot for transferring value faster and cheaper than BTC

[24-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there is not really any other functionality

[24-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to buy LTC to create a new anything, yet it is worth how much?

[24-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jl777c#5810
just from its usage as currency

[24-Jun-19 06:14 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD is the currency for the ecosystem. as the ecosystem grows, the value of KMD grows

[24-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Oszy#5734
understand, thanks for explaining. i was just thinking at ETH price levels and why ETH is where it is, and of course KMD will increase who knows by how much and when, but it will sure.

[24-Jun-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think ETH price is where it is to a  very large degree due to the size of its ecosystem

[24-Jun-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it also has tokenomics and people maybe put too much weight to the tokenomics aspect

[24-Jun-19 06:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if tokenomics worked so good, the NXT 10% tax rate and sky high txfees would be dominating the industry

[24-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes

[24-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Alexfrog#1338
better scaling and lower fees is why KMD is superior to ETH

BTC Dominance:  59.5%
