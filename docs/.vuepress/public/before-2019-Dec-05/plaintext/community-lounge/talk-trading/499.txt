hmm... I never checked in detail what Bithunb is- but it says on their banner s.t. about 'DEX' - seems it can't be so DEX then, if it was hacked...

So what are we going to do about onboarding. Shops to accept ARRR?

[30-Mar-19 09:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We’ve got a VRSC and ARRR bounty for each shop and user that signs on.

$KMD #KOMODO

One of my largest bags.
Ready to breakout.

In $BTC pair: nice ascending triangle. If we can break through 29K resistance, the 46K target comes in play for a swing.

In $USD pair: tested resistance some times now. Next test = breakout. Looking at $1,80.

`Alot of exchanges are starting to tighten down.`
That's the duality of trying to turn uncensored currencies into regulated commodities 😕

We will need some votes on this one for KMD.   Raven has a big community of long time miners who have bags to pump 😃
I might be one of them :trollface:  but the facts in the vote are in KMDs favor.

[30-Mar-19 07:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There is a change coming on Tuesday April 2 that may affect you if you make bank deposits or withdrawals through your Kraken account. Your account is only verified to the “Tier 2” level, which in some countries enables bank funding in small amounts of $2,000 USD or less. In order to streamline our client experience and offer better overall service, we are simplifying the Kraken verification levels. Since your account is only verified to Tier 2, the change on April 2 means that an upgrade will be required to have continued access to bank funding. Upgrading your account is a smooth and easy process requiring documentation such as a government issued ID and proof of residence. After the upgrade you will enjoy much higher funding limits and other benefits such as higher margin trading limits and access to Kraken Futures!

[30-Mar-19 07:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kraken also demanding more kyc shit

[30-Mar-19 07:38 PM] hastrup#8742
@Cryptoon thx for the heads up! 👍

anybody care to take bets which exchange will be first to ask for DNA swabs? [so easy and convenient, just stick the little cotton thingie in your mouth and send it to us] ☄

[30-Mar-19 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my money's on Coinbase

[30-Mar-19 08:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I say bitmex

[30-Mar-19 08:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That way they can see for correlations between mental retardation found in DNA and using 100x leverage

[30-Mar-19 08:21 PM] bishop#9773
Coinbase would use a rectal test before they did mouth swabs.

[30-Mar-19 08:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe they do a twofer

[30-Mar-19 08:38 PM] bishop#9773
Precisely, start rectally before swabbing the mouth. Coinbase style (A-to-M)

[30-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is barterdex 2.0 ready yet?

[30-Mar-19 08:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Now is the fucking time tbh

[30-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Thanos#0414
@Hollowman9000 what is bartedex?

[30-Mar-19 08:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
a decentralized exchange

[30-Mar-19 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
True dex

[30-Mar-19 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[30-Mar-19 08:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[30-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hindered by its engine currently

[30-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Thanos#0414
in which platform? Komodo?

[30-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s platformless really

[30-Mar-19 08:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Load your coin, find your market

[30-Mar-19 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes it's by komodo

[30-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Thanos#0414
sounds great!

[30-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
As in, you don’t have to own KMD to use it

[30-Mar-19 08:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not really "on" komodo, since you store your coins in your native wallet of whatever they are

[30-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Thanos#0414
and how will it connect all available markets? will it use something like ZRX relay?

[30-Mar-19 08:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I think anyway, it’s been over a year since I last tested it

[30-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Thanos#0414
sry but im new in Komodo

[30-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Loads the respective blockchains

[30-Mar-19 08:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Swaps between them, chain to chain

[30-Mar-19 08:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Thanos the over-simplified explanation is:
you open an app
it uses P2P to connect to others that have it open
you trade freely with whomever has what you want

[30-Mar-19 08:47 PM] Thanos#0414
but will it have liquidity?

[30-Mar-19 08:48 PM] Thanos#0414
because chain to chain swaps will require liquidity to fill high volume orders right?

[30-Mar-19 08:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yes

[30-Mar-19 08:48 PM] Thanos#0414
thats great!

[30-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Needs market makers, there are some but not enough

[30-Mar-19 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
obviously if you want 10 CoinX then there needs to be someone with 10CoinX to fill your order
how many someones there will be, who knows

[30-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Thanos#0414
and when will it be available?

[30-Mar-19 08:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In testing now

[30-Mar-19 08:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
2.0 version will be easier to use and offer a more flawless experience
