[07-Mar-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
who knows how much KMD they actually have. it seems they must be trading among themselves

[07-Mar-19 06:55 AM] Mark81#4505
that list only involves people who have registered and are verified users. dont know what are limits for non registered users.

[07-Mar-19 06:57 AM] Mark81#4505
and there are lot of existing volume from else where since those accounts holds volume from beginning of contests.

[07-Mar-19 07:06 AM] Mark81#4505
By watching huobis orderbooks you can see something doesn't add up. there is not enough liquidity for such volumes. price would skyrocket with that volume.

[07-Mar-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
off book orders?

[07-Mar-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
some exchanges let you put orders that dont appear publicly, but they fill if a matching order comes in

[07-Mar-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
huobi does have a lot of very big traders for whom a million per day is just a small test trade

[07-Mar-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and with all the recent news about KMD, maybe was already curious and making a "free 50000 KMD" pushed them over the edge to start trading

[07-Mar-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then so did the other guy

[07-Mar-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and they now self trade to their other account to boost volumes to crazy levels

[07-Mar-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just a theory and possible explanation for what we see

[07-Mar-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
big question is what happens after the trade competition

[07-Mar-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
these are huobi traders trading to win the trading competition

[07-Mar-19 09:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you have a million kmd and dump it after the competition, the damage will be bigger than the 50k kmd bounty :p

[07-Mar-19 10:49 AM] Keppie#5156
About 22 hours left on the trading comp on Huobi

[07-Mar-19 10:52 AM] Keppie#5156
As they state here, there is a ranking which is updated on march 4 & 6. Can anyone help me out with a link to that

[07-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Vertigo#0439
I  can put 10 kmd to keep the competition for another month.

[07-Mar-19 11:04 AM] Keppie#5156

Huobi is making the wash-trading on Coinbene look like child's play 😄

[07-Mar-19 11:30 AM] Keppie#5156
They upped it to 300kmd every 6sec lol

[07-Mar-19 11:31 AM] Keppie#5156
Not sure what the deal is with fees on huobi. But losing this trading comp with 3mil kmd traded must hurt lol

[07-Mar-19 11:32 AM] Keppie#5156
50k kmd doesnt even break even the trading fees

[07-Mar-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
what are the trading fees? 1%??

[07-Mar-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
50K KMD would cover 50 million trading at 0.1%

[07-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Keppie#5156
Ok mis calcs

[07-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Keppie#5156
it's 0.2%

[07-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Keppie#5156
But im sure the huobi whales own a ton of huobi tokens; equivalent of bnb

[07-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Vertigo#0439
If we get to a $100 dollars I will buy a Komodo dragon and name it James.

I put heaps/all of my super annuation into some gold miners in 2017, and while gold hasnt done well, they are up like 70-130% in the same time 😃

[07-Mar-19 02:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so either, they figured out how to mine gold waaayy cheaper or people are specualting that gold si going to rise a lot.

[07-Mar-19 02:37 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I have a feeling JPM will launch a silver backed coin with all the physical silver they are hoarding.... I could see them doing that one day

[07-Mar-19 02:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Gold looks dog shit tho`
yeah, it sux that all the gold above ground is only worth 8.64 trillion US$

[07-Mar-19 02:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
gold as a store of value in modern society is only slightly less silly than cowry shells

[07-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Wazzup#0510
that s not how gold works as a store of value lol

[07-Mar-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, there`s about 2 trillion US$ just waiting for you to dig up if you really don't like your tiny investment at $1,288.87 an oz

[07-Mar-19 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`that s not how gold works as a store of value lol`
oh? please elaborate....

[07-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Wazzup#0510
"gold as a store of value in modern society is only slightly less silly than cowry shells" you first...

[07-Mar-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because it's not the 1800s and it's only real non-utility value is, quite literally, the exact same as when societies used cowry shells

[07-Mar-19 02:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Jewelry: The Primary Use of Gold
 Financial Gold: Coinage, Bullion, Backing
 Uses of Gold in Electronics
 Uses of Gold in Computers
 Uses of Gold in Dentistry
 Medical Uses of Gold
 Uses of Gold in Aerospace
 Uses of Gold in Awards & Status Symbols
 Uses of Gold in Glassmaking
 Gold Gilding and Gold Leaf

Hell no, there is a flat price floor for gold that will be sustained if speculation goes away and for that it has intrinsic value

[07-Mar-19 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I love that I say "non-utility" and your response is utility, ty for being predictably wrong

[07-Mar-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
based on your premise, one should stop investing in gold and buy shares of white oak

[07-Mar-19 02:52 PM] Wazzup#0510
how did you come up with that lol ?

[07-Mar-19 02:53 PM] Wazzup#0510
Yes, a lot of things have  intrinsic value, but investing in something purely based that is retarded.

[07-Mar-19 02:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because it has more utility and is more scarce at the higher utility levels

[07-Mar-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
naturally increasing store of value

[07-Mar-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
literally the older it is, the more utility it has

[07-Mar-19 02:54 PM] Wazzup#0510
Yeah, as if the world  will not evolve

[07-Mar-19 02:55 PM] Wazzup#0510
You speculate on the future appreciation in value of something

[07-Mar-19 02:56 PM] Wazzup#0510
if you tell me long term you see white oak appreciating in price

[07-Mar-19 02:56 PM] Wazzup#0510

[07-Mar-19 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Yeah, as if the world will not evolve`
Yup, right past the concept of gold as a "scarce resource" (we literally throw the shit away) and a useful store of value 🙄

[07-Mar-19 02:57 PM] Wazzup#0510
scarcity doesn t imply value

future utility
