We have a very long way to go before market interest and volumes can support anything close to that

[25-Jul-18 11:56 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Taken a peak at the KMD distribution lately?

[25-Jul-18 11:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Piss one or two of those whales off and KMD is smoked

[25-Jul-18 11:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Single satoshi level smoked

[25-Jul-18 12:04 PM] jorian#4555
better set my buys then

[25-Jul-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly at 100x current market cap there would be 100x more daily inventory. Nowadays it is about 1.5 BTC

[25-Jul-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
every day. such massive sell pressure

Dark Net episode 3 season 2 on netflix is on bitcoin

[25-Jul-18 12:30 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Maybe we'll see more upwards movement when all kmd is mined and in circulation?

[25-Jul-18 12:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
most of it comes from the 5% rewards

for that to happen you'd have to wait about 13 years üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 12:46 PM] crumb#2550
then all the KMD from the rewards should be in circulation

[25-Jul-18 12:47 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
No problem.. will wait till then.. meantime accumulation.

Nice!!!!!!!!

[25-Jul-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
10% usage level of BTC, above BCH

[25-Jul-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems KMD focus on actual usage has been effective

[25-Jul-18 03:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
With each additional notarizing chain KMD is used more.

[25-Jul-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the actual activity of ETH chains are overstated as to what people consider transactions and for KMD it is understated

[25-Jul-18 04:06 PM] crumb#2550
for me it's a bit surprise to see EOS that high

[25-Jul-18 04:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
At 0.5 sec blocktime thats 172k trx per day just for that. Lots of the rest might be voting.

[25-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Go all in EOS?

[25-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
BTC abc correction on the 1W

[25-Jul-18 04:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Test 7600?

[25-Jul-18 04:18 PM] CHMEX#0686
The only EOS I know with actual usage is Canon EOS:trollface:

[25-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
kmd is up 9 % idk if the volume can indicate a breakout since btc is going to slow down a little bit now

[25-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but ta indicates bullish divergence.

[25-Jul-18 04:37 PM] Buddz1993#5380
4 mil of volume is quite a lot compared to what we are used to see from weeks.

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Depends how skittish it is

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Buddz1993#5380
last time we had this volume we were touching 4  usd price,

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Watch a few dump and new buys vanish

[25-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye it can be a pnd scheme once again.

[25-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
RSI curving up nicely though

[25-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380

[25-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thats a lot.

[25-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I've noticed a lot more people talking about komodo in the crypto sphere. Someone liked how it looked.

[25-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thus price incrased 1.82 usd

[25-Jul-18 05:43 PM] jorian#4555

I always felt like komodo deserved the 2 dollar mark or more when compared to other coins of higher value. Of course I wont argue for 50 or over.

[25-Jul-18 05:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
He could have waited till friday :/

[25-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You had the dude asking which scaling chain he should use on twitter

[25-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I've been getting a lot of outreach from the various blockchains/crypto to explore powering our ecosystem - so which do you work with and would recommend for high TPS and volume?

He has a nice bag of followers it seems

[25-Jul-18 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
I think blocktivity showing KMD with 10% of BTC activity and more than BCH was noteworthy

[25-Jul-18 05:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Have you seen the avi stat too?

[25-Jul-18 05:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

So I've been recommended to look at @Ripple @KomodoWorld @Omise @DigiByteCoin @orbs_network @OSTdotcom - anyone else I should look at for high TPV and TPS payments?

if I were trading on central exchanges, I would set buys below market and wait for the dumpers

[25-Jul-18 06:01 PM] jl777c#5810
there really isnt a cheap way to get lots of KMD as the sellside isnt that big

[25-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There was a 12k sell order on Trex a few days ago

[25-Jul-18 06:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Think whoever that was capitulated and dumped the buy side though

[25-Jul-18 06:02 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That looked savage at ~19k aswell

[25-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably looks really savage in hindsight
