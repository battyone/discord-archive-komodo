`perhaps it doesn't have the best tech now but that doesn't rly matter...`
🤦🏽 
`Which coin is the real btc?`
none

[10-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
im sure genie want to point out that he doesnt give a shit about btc anymore cause its not the same like it use to be

[10-Feb-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
KMD the real btc :troll_king:

[10-Feb-19 05:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Markus I don't give a shit about it because BTC isn't Bitcoin and I care about currency and not commodities (or else I'd still be trading cattle futures and hog bellies)

[10-Feb-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Lanii That you can make the claim that a tech coin that doesn't have the best tech should still be counted as among the "best" leads me to believe you're too much of a fanboy to even have a rational conversation with, so I'm going to lunch now

[10-Feb-19 05:36 PM] richardt#2807
I think he is right though.  If looking purely at consensus instead of opinion, BTC is still the best coin.  KMD is notarizing to it after all.

[10-Feb-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`consensus` of what?
consensus of forced options because CEX's only offer 2-4 options for base pairs?

[10-Feb-19 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`KMD is notarizing to it after all.`
for entirely unrelated reasons

[10-Feb-19 05:40 PM] richardt#2807
Hashrate and consensus are entirely unrelated?

[10-Feb-19 05:41 PM] Lanii#8302
So just because for example nano or some other shitcoin that is fully centralized and has better tech should overtake btc?

[10-Feb-19 05:41 PM] Lanii#8302
Obviously after 10 years there are gonna be new coins with better tech

[10-Feb-19 05:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That it has the greatest invested in hashrate by no means makes it "the best coin"
and yes "Hashrate and consensus are entirely unrelated" because you're comparing apples to oranges and saying bananas are awesome

[10-Feb-19 05:41 PM] Lanii#8302
But there is only one btc and I couldn't care less about your shitcoins with muh tech

[10-Feb-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But there is only one btc and I couldn't care less about your shitcoins with muh tech`
then why dafuq are you here, you silly feken troll?

I might be a fanboy, but way better being a btc fanboy then bch "satoshi real vision" fanboy

So as hashrate goes up, consensus is unaffected?

[10-Feb-19 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody know what is going on with SIA? there seems to be 3 coins with significant hashrate

`So as hashrate goes up, consensus is unaffected?`
99.9999999% of the time, yes
Most hashrate increases are coupled with non-nodes mining in public pools and consensus is entirely unaffected
Because, Bitcoin

@jl777c  are you trying to make a point or just asking? 😃

[10-Feb-19 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Feb-19 06:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@meatspoon as always, it's not about "viewpoints", it's about facts
If you mine in a public pool with 1 S7 and then you purchase 100000 S15s and mine in that same pool with all of them, you have not changed consensus one iota

[10-Feb-19 06:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
You are a classy renaissance man, PP... The pinnacle of gentlemanly behavior.  A model to children and grown men alike.  Not at all, uh, the opposite of those things.

[10-Feb-19 06:24 PM] richardt#2807
So if you suddenly gain over 50% of the hashrate, that doesn't change consensus at all?  Thought that was the whole idea behind a 51% attack...

[10-Feb-19 06:26 PM] richardt#2807
Besides, I wasn't originally talking about consensus within a single blockchain, but consensus about which blockchain is the real or "best" one.  It seems that the answer is whichever one has the highest hashrate

[10-Feb-19 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`So if you suddenly gain over 50% of the hashrate, that doesn't change consensus at all? Thought that was the whole idea behind a 51% attack...`
you're conflating concepts
`So if you suddenly gain over 50% of the hashrate, that doesn't change consensus at all?`
If, as stated previously, that increase stays with the same 1 node then , no, that doesn't change consensus at all (not even the slightest bit). If this is consusing to you, then I suggest you look up what "consensus" is/means and how it works.
`Besides, I wasn't originally talking about consensus within a single blockchain, but consensus about which blockchain is the real or "best" one.`
Again, this is at best a skewed concept.
>Bitcoing is the best because Bitcoin is the best, even when it's not
leads to the inability for any other coin to ever be "the best".
 `It seems that the answer is whichever one has the highest hashrate`
Even to that end, other algos have different means of measurement. By that hashrate measurement alone concept, VRSC is 42x "better" than ZEC and has a difficulty 3307x harder than KMD, so everything in the equihash realm is shit and we should just all dump it all and bow to VRSC as our new god

[10-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
sia situation shows that is not necessarily the case

[10-Feb-19 07:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Dang, I hope you aren't disagreeing with the Pink Pony.  He will have to tell you how wrong you are...  because of "words", as he would say.

@meatspoon Any time you want to point out something I say as being factually incorrect, feel free to do so as opposed to your usual trolling

[10-Feb-19 07:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
Oh, you have already informed me that all of my opinions are wrong while yours are not. So I am all squared away. But feel free so sort JL out. Sounds like he isn’t in 100% agreement with you and, as you y have noted many times, you are not wrong. So seems like he could use some of your respectful guidance.

[10-Feb-19 07:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've never claimed that I'm never wrong; that's merely your trolling claim
I've been factually wrong many times and never once afraid or shy to admit it when someone points out something I'm specifically wrong about
That's the difference between me stating facts as I know them and you spewing silly trolling opinions

@siu - Chainmakers it’s funny how that is often how it ends with him tho... sensing a pattern here.

[10-Feb-19 07:31 PM] richardt#2807
So now the argument is about who is better at arguing.  It never ends.  😃

[10-Feb-19 07:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
Not with the Pink Pony, it doesn’t.  For months and months I have watched him be rude and patronizing to people, pushing otherwise curious and respectful people into arguments for the sake of arguing.  Its a bad look.

[10-Feb-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`...into arguments for the sake of arguing....`
Pointing out that which is factually inaccurate is not "for the sake of arguing", but rather for the sake of being factually accurate.
Or would you prefer we just say "fek facts" and whatever cockamamie idea gets the most believers on didntreddit becomes our new "reality"?

[10-Feb-19 08:31 PM] Ocash#5347
@meatspoon you're totally right. However, in this case that guy was calling KMD a shitcoin (if I understood well) and  @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 had every right to call him troll. I'm with him on that one. There is a place and time for everything. Going in the KMD channels calling it shitcoin is the definition of trolling.

[10-Feb-19 08:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
` in this case that guy was calling KMD a shitcoin (if I understood well)`
Literally what I got out of what he was saying and why I asked him why he was even here

[10-Feb-19 08:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
Who?  Matrapaz?  I saw him calling other coins shitcoins and lamenting that KMD had less volume than shitcoins....

[10-Feb-19 08:36 PM] Ocash#5347
Yes. He said "your shitcoins"

The only tech coin I ever tout is Komodo, so the reference can only be to Komodo

[10-Feb-19 08:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because, context and words

[10-Feb-19 08:39 PM] Lanii#8302
Lol, I never actually called kmd shit coin

[10-Feb-19 08:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
Fair enough. I suppose that was a rude thing of Matrapaz to say.  Another related observation, Pink Pony tends to bring out the worst in people.

[10-Feb-19 08:39 PM] Lanii#8302
I've been a big fan of kmd since mid 2017

[10-Feb-19 08:40 PM] Lanii#8302
I was calling shitcoins whatever he was refering to as "the true bitcoin"

[10-Feb-19 08:40 PM] Lanii#8302
Which I asumed must be the satoshi vision or something else with "great tech"

[10-Feb-19 08:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
That actually makes more sense.

[10-Feb-19 08:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
PP is always getting his panties in a bunch over BTC.

[10-Feb-19 08:40 PM] Lanii#8302
I also said I cant belive so many shitcoins have more volume then kmd

[10-Feb-19 08:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I was calling shitcoins whatever he was refering to as "the true bitcoin"`
then you never actually read the words I typed and merely inserted whatever you wanted my words to say (more than once I've, literally, said "none" are)

[10-Feb-19 08:41 PM] Lanii#8302
Im not rly here to convince people but it seems as his arguments are coming straight from Roger Ver

as is my hate for bcash

[10-Feb-19 08:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
I think its funny that PP will call BTC a shitcoin knowing that he will likely offend many people here who own BTC. But then he will act like he is taking a principled stand against people (maaaaybe) implying KMD is a shitcoin.

[10-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Lanii#8302
It doesn't rly matter, if btc dies everything will die with it

[10-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Lanii#8302
Btc is the front of crypto

[10-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Lanii#8302

A system that was designed to be "electronic cash" stops being that system when the current regime literally states that they want it to be precisely *not* that

[10-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Lanii#8302
and therefor its not worth anything anymore?

[10-Feb-19 08:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`and therefor its not worth anything anymore?`
Worth something and being *the* measure of value aren't the same thing
Yes, BTC has worth (because all things with 2 or more people assigning worth to them do); however, it shouldn't be the god-like end-all of value becuase there's no basis for it being so

[10-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Lanii#8302
Well that is just your opinion

[10-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Lanii#8302
and obviously market doesn't agree with you

[10-Feb-19 08:51 PM] meatspoon#7860
but, but, but.... Genie's opinion is right!!  He told me so!  (rudely, i might add)

[10-Feb-19 08:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Actually, the market *does* agree with me, they are just slow to catch up to what I say :P
If you doubt that, search our old slack and you'll see I called the current market well over a year ago because the bubble had no foundation
