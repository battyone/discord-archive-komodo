[22-Jul-19 01:18 AM] JimD#9272
600 bucks I mined from Eth turned into 25K

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] JimD#9272
I sold it for 15K and then watch it go back to nothing as the market tanked

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] Caglio#3337
very good, I understand you have the time to wait for it

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] JimD#9272
it was glorious

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] Caglio#3337
You earned and cashed out

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] Caglio#3337
Well played sir

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] JimD#9272
Im betting something will happen again

[22-Jul-19 01:19 AM] Caglio#3337
In long run, I am pretty sure some crypto will make ppl rich

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Some can wait, some can not

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] JimD#9272
I have some time

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Many will fail tho

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] Caglio#3337
But I have respect for guys like you and Charlie Lee

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] Caglio#3337
You were smart enough, and cashed out

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] JimD#9272
hopefully crypto will fuel my midlife crisis

[22-Jul-19 01:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Playing with profits is good

[22-Jul-19 01:22 AM] p.#1126
@Caglio  loan me 5 dollaz

[22-Jul-19 01:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm just waiting for the mobile dex. the demand is baked in thx to govt hype. I'm not selling. I made the easy money in 2017 as well. this is like the retirement bag. It's been pretty exciting. dont let this shit bother you too much. it was every bit as gut wrenching in 2017.

[22-Jul-19 01:23 AM] Caglio#3337
@p. I cannot, I need to buy myself a ledger and buy some bitcoin so I can stick up  my ass, also that ledger will solve my problem with komodo shitty wallets ( :

[22-Jul-19 01:24 AM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks Respect for you 2 sir

[22-Jul-19 01:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
if you have to sell, just dont sell the whole stack

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
i learned that one hard

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I lost so much money on gambling

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I am deep in this shit, and would be happy as gamblers are

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
just to get their money back

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
But

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I am willing to gamble it all away

[22-Jul-19 01:25 AM] Caglio#3337
Few thousands of $ wont change my life, so it might even go to 0 as far as I am concerned

[22-Jul-19 01:26 AM] Caglio#3337
I am not selling it unless I am @ least out with a money I invested in

[22-Jul-19 01:26 AM] Caglio#3337
I am probably not buying more tho, I had enough of it

[22-Jul-19 01:28 AM] JimD#9272
I would rather buy a coin like KMD than BTC.  Solid tech and low market cap

[22-Jul-19 01:29 AM] JimD#9272
Though it pretty obvious BTC would be a winning strategy

[22-Jul-19 01:29 AM] JimD#9272
Have been buying BTC on the Dips, waiting for the bounce then buying KMD

[22-Jul-19 01:29 AM] JimD#9272
so tend to go in with a 10-15% buffer

Disclosure: I plan to move ~20% of my crypto portfolio to ZCash this quarter.

After transactions are complete (first initiated earlier today), Iâ€™ll still be majority BTC, but ZEC will leapfrog ETH as my second largest holding.

Eth is completely fucked

[22-Jul-19 01:05 PM] Markus#5464
cant even come up with own solutions with a mountain of devs

[22-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Neko#5830
it is known

[22-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Markus#5464
imagine kmd with all those devs, kmd tech would be few decades ahead of reality

[22-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Markus#5464
even more then now

[22-Jul-19 01:10 PM] JimD#9272
I thought Matic was going to scale Eth

[22-Jul-19 01:11 PM] hyperDEX#6586
there are like 2-3 different scaling projects worth lots and lots of money.....

[22-Jul-19 01:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
They dont have to scale if they get the money ðŸ˜„

[22-Jul-19 01:12 PM] JimD#9272
Im a matic investor and been getting dumped on for months now

[22-Jul-19 01:12 PM] JimD#9272
thats what I get for trusting in pajeets

[22-Jul-19 01:13 PM] Neko#5830
scaling is what kmd did, separated chain with the security of a big one

[22-Jul-19 01:13 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, KMD is a great solution

[22-Jul-19 01:13 PM] JimD#9272
Now we just gotta convince people ðŸ˜‰

[22-Jul-19 01:14 PM] Neko#5830

People are too short sighted

[22-Jul-19 01:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Give kmd another year, price might be higher or might be lower, but i cant say without any doubt, we will have lots of users using our tech.
