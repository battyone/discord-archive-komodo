[26-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Mark81#4505
There seems to be blood on streets for some.

[26-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder thats bullshit

[26-Jun-19 02:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
obviously that's just my opinion, you can go check with the marketing team

[26-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Mark81#4505

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
@Malti btc doesnt need any ?

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Monero is not easily traced, ofg course it will tank, because wall street doesnt  like it.

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Mark81#4505
Okay in terms of one year salary?

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
One year salary it is mark

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If indeed this is the institutional money causing the pump

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
a little bit above

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
But if I sell it now, its not that much

[26-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Caglio#3337
It would be like 10/11 months salary

[26-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337
It might go back up tho

[26-Jun-19 02:12 PM] coingirl87#6489
You say marketing has no money? I think thats not true...maybe somebody of marketing or jll777 can say how the fund of marketing is

[26-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Markus#5464
why would u sell now anyway.,...wait 1-2 year and kmd will be significantly higher then today

[26-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Mark81#4505
You won't be alone on that ship.

[26-Jun-19 02:15 PM] coingirl87#6489
Its ok when you are not going with my opinion but its not ok, that you make jokrs about me or my feelings about bad marketing....i give komodo 50 btc in 2016 to do good things...90%is very good but for me marketing is not so good as the could be...so i "complaining" about it

[26-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337

this bullshit does nothing

[26-Jun-19 02:16 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Marketing is fine, there are solid posts about new things on Twitter and Medium

[26-Jun-19 02:16 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Marketing is not announcing a annountement of a partnership that most coins do

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They did the chainlizzard and mobile dex apps

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats the starting bullshit

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Both of which are awesome pieces of software i tested myself

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Caglio#3337
We need to make people aware of the coin, not letting them "find about us"

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Cos they wont

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Caglio#3337
Wake up ppl

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Caglio#3337
They fucking wont

[26-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Malti#3948
But what do you want marketed? 
"Buy Komodo"
OR
"Use Komodo"

[26-Jun-19 02:18 PM] c2k#4915

[26-Jun-19 02:19 PM] coingirl87#6489
@siu - Chainmakers totaly agree with you but to be honest....99% of people cant difference between good or bad tech...people also think, that facebook coin is better than bitcoin

[26-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Ok, enough, everything is fine

[26-Jun-19 02:19 PM] coingirl87#6489
