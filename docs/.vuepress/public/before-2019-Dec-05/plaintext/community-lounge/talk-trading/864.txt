@Markus as long as you dont mix the dust with utxo from a different address, no info is leaked

[26-Jun-19 08:38 PM] Alecandro#1179
jeeeeeez some real shit is going on right now with BTC lol

[26-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you just use the wallet to sendtoaddress, it is apt to combine random utxo together and all that are used are linked

[26-Jun-19 08:38 PM] Markus#5464
alright i see

[26-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not any normal market action, it is a coordinated action. the goal could have been to simply accumulate a lot of alts at 50% discount

[26-Jun-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
most people are stuck with a binary decision at the current bid/ask

[26-Jun-19 08:40 PM] dan.#2473
looks like 2500 btc dumped with a quick look

[26-Jun-19 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
an army of "its the end of the world", "there is no marketing" to push some peoples panic buttons

*dan.: dafuq is wrong with market sellers n buyers*

nothing is wrong üòÉ just another day at the office

[26-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so the fact that a few panickers sold at bargain prices, does not mean that is a solid high volume price

[26-Jun-19 08:41 PM] Markus#5464
coinbase goes between 12k and 12,5k in seconds üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810

now stop dumping kmd

[26-Jun-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
and the alt prices are net below where it was, so time for the harvesting of low alt prices

[26-Jun-19 08:42 PM] Markus#5464
and this is why bitcoin wont see a ETF anytime soon

[26-Jun-19 08:42 PM] Markus#5464
good luck to ppl who hoped for it üòÑ

[26-Jun-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of work to make 25%, but when playing with 100,000 BTC, i guess it might be worth the trouble

[26-Jun-19 08:43 PM] Oriol02#9169
longs are rekt xd

[26-Jun-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
also notice that coins not in the top rankings had no fiatbots adjusting their prices in realtime

[26-Jun-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this alts go lower when BTC goes up, is a fiction that is created by the fiat bots, for their masters profits

[26-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
most people wouldnt adjust their BTC price for a coin, based on the realtime fiat price

[26-Jun-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some miners would if all their costs are in fiat, but what i see is vast majority of top altcoins fiatpegged during these BTC surges

[26-Jun-19 08:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Coinbase down

[26-Jun-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that is not any normal priceaction, even if we all got used to it
