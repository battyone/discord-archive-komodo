[09-Nov-19 09:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Suprisingly quiet here with this extreme pump , compared to when it dumps

[09-Nov-19 09:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

Is this cuz exchange listing?

[09-Nov-19 10:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
doubt it, never heard of those exchanges tbfh

[09-Nov-19 10:30 AM] jeezy#3408
just part of the current alt push I guess

[09-Nov-19 10:30 AM] jeezy#3408
still if its enough to break   above key levels we could at least hold sideways and build more up from it

btc dominance broke trendline

[09-Nov-19 11:24 AM] CoinKing88#1540

Nice pump this morning to 9600 sats

[09-Nov-19 11:24 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Feels like so long ago that KMD did moves like this

[09-Nov-19 11:32 AM] jorian#4555
it means either BTC is about to take a dump, or alts are going to have a little revival

[09-Nov-19 11:32 AM] jorian#4555
or a bit of both

[09-Nov-19 12:07 PM] Neko#5830
its possible kraken or some big exchange is going to list kmd

Wallet maintenance' for Komodo on Binance over past days...

[09-Nov-19 12:24 PM] CHMEX#0686
there will be an update later this month

[09-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Citex is a good exchange I think, they also list ARRR iirc

[09-Nov-19 12:26 PM] CHMEX#0686
they listed it even on their own initiative. Maybe some C level Person likes the KMD ecosystem

[09-Nov-19 12:26 PM] Cryptoon#3362
We the future

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Neko#5830
nice they have usdt pairs

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
kmd only listed on btc and eth tho

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
sadly

[09-Nov-19 12:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bittrex also has a usd pair

[09-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And very thin books

[09-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Markus#5464
oh wow its listed on usdt also

[09-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Markus#5464
nice

[09-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Markus#5464
strange, their announcement was writing btc and eth

[09-Nov-19 12:31 PM] Neko#5830
what are the chances of komodo pulling a neo/antshares

[09-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
thats what we all wish for altho im not gonna have such hopes cause nobody knows ðŸ˜›

{Reactions}
KMD 

[09-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Neko#5830
yeah

[09-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Chances are there

[09-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure how high

[09-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Would prefer a steady growth though

[09-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
10% weekly is fine :troll_lol:

[09-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Markus#5464
u guys got any goals and targets for this bullrun when it comes to kmd and btc?

[09-Nov-19 12:36 PM] Neko#5830
it feels like komodo will spike to $5 any day now

[09-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have a certain target for my total portfolio where I start taking profits weighted for each coin

[09-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Did so early this summer luckily enough which allowed me to rebuy 3x the amount of kmd for that part

[09-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Markus#5464
thats amazing ðŸ˜›

[09-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But Im not a good trader tbh

[09-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And I always feel bad for selling

[09-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ðŸ‘†

[09-Nov-19 12:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yes

[09-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
always tough to let them go!

[09-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sell on the bullrun upward and buy during bear, but its easier said than done

[09-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
soon as price goes up a bit I want them all back !

[09-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Haha for real

[09-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe when we go 4x from here I take out a % to cover the amount put in and after that only cashout or reinvest rewards

[09-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Markus#5464
I think we will have a interesting year next year, alot of ppl talking about a huge collapse in the stock market 2020 and not even gold have managed to hold up during previous stock market crashes

[09-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
look at kmd 6 hour chart

[09-Nov-19 12:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
moving perfectly sideways at the moment

[09-Nov-19 12:47 PM] Markus#5464
daily is straight up, parabolic rise

[09-Nov-19 12:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
some whale set their bot to accumulate KMD through thick or thin for like 2 weeks straight? lol

[09-Nov-19 12:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
oh it's looking good, don't get me wrong, sideways motion prob a bullish flag of sorts, not a TA guy myself.. anyone in here do charts ?

[09-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
where you think we're headed ?

[09-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
expect any significant retrace / entry point? right now ?

[09-Nov-19 12:50 PM] Markus#5464
well at this moment were fighting resistance

[09-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Markus#5464
But it does look like kmd got alot of power at this moment, so i dont expect a pullback yet even if it would probably be healthy after this massive rally

[09-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Markus#5464
in the end we pumped 83% in 2 weeks

[09-Nov-19 12:51 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
niceeeeee

[09-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that where we are at now?

[09-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or the peak ?

[09-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Markus#5464
well the peak of 9,6k is 83% gain from the bottom we created

[09-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
gotcha

[09-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Markus#5464
but i hope it keeps going and that we can create a new base above 10k

[09-Nov-19 12:53 PM] Markus#5464
that would be great

[09-Nov-19 02:01 PM] Neko#5830
ill assume bilaxy volume is 90% fake

[09-Nov-19 02:22 PM] cipi#4502
do they have deposits/withdrawals open?

[09-Nov-19 02:35 PM] Oszy#5734
nop

[09-Nov-19 02:36 PM] Oszy#5734
but i also think they do't have 4 million daily volume with and orderbook like that

[09-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Andersen#8337
Opinion : atomicDEX stress test has attracted a large number of users to participate in the lottery.  They had to check the atomicDEX in the case.   They saw that this is real and it works.   We also need a stress test with a lottery, and the project will go straight to the top20 .

[09-Nov-19 04:41 PM] Markus#5464
Not sure the new users got the feeling that atomicdex works since it was not rly working during stress test but it was done intentionally to see where it breaks and to collect useful data ðŸ˜›

[09-Nov-19 04:44 PM] Andersen#8337
They could have tried atomicDEX after the test, when things started working out the way they should.

[09-Nov-19 04:44 PM] Markus#5464
True

[09-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Poststresstest communication was also on point tbh

[09-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Could have given a lot of confidence

[09-Nov-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
Indeed it was rly impressive

[09-Nov-19 05:07 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
10k sats soon?

This is a retrace up :)

[09-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
+13% today, we are on a moon mission !

[09-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
lets reach that 200 daily ma

[09-Nov-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
~11k

[09-Nov-19 05:35 PM] tolken#2655
I made a tiny profit in the abyss. But didnâ€™t get greedy and sold at a modest gain. Was goofy when we broke below 0.00015 if you ask me. But whatevs.

[09-Nov-19 05:40 PM] richardt#2807
Alot of excitement about the pump, but let's not forget it's still down over 90% from ATH. I suppose we should still be grateful for little gains here and there ðŸ˜„

[09-Nov-19 05:41 PM] CoinKing88#1540
If a shitcoin like Link can do 500% gains why not kmd? Next week will be epic
