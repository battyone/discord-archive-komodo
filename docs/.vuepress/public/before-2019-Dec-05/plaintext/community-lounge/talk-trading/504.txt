Bound to happen

[02-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if you have tons of money, and you want to buy alts, you pump BTC.  it makes alts tank, then you spend the btc on them

[02-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so dumb

[02-Apr-19 04:57 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the kmd/$ pair is still doing well though

[02-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Alecandro#1179
haha I was just going to say - que "$ value of portfolio watching only"

[02-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
who cares about kmd/$

[02-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i only care about satoshi price

[02-Apr-19 05:00 AM] p.#1126
dropping faST

[02-Apr-19 05:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
like, this would be fine, if alts would go UP like this if btc dropped

[02-Apr-19 05:01 AM] p.#1126
btc needs to find and hold not drop for that

[02-Apr-19 05:01 AM] p.#1126

[02-Apr-19 05:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
sold an alt that hadnt tanked yet and bought under 25500 😄

[02-Apr-19 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sold an alt that hadnt tanked yet and bought under 25500`
so, you bought BTC at $19,000?

[02-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
bought kmd under 25500 sats

[02-Apr-19 05:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, you said alt that hadn't tanked yet so the natural assumption was BTC

[02-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
youre saying btc is an alt 😛

[02-Apr-19 05:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
hehe

[02-Apr-19 05:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[02-Apr-19 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

`im not sure why you think i think that Genie

then why use terminology that suggests you do?

[02-Apr-19 05:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
other coins are only "alts" if BTC is "the coin"

[02-Apr-19 05:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`genie, because when i use those words everyone else understands what i mean,`
Yes, you mean that you want all other coins compared to BTC in a manner that BTC matters most
because, words

[02-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but i'd probably just have still spent all my btc 😄

[02-Apr-19 05:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
