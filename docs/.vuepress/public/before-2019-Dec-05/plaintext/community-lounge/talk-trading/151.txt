"The median home value in Chicago is $225,600"

fuck me 1 house in straya  or 3 houses in merica

[12-Sep-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the house price here is so high, because the government structured the economy to source all its debt from the housing market

[12-Sep-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
rather than borrow itself

[12-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
dunno if thats true

[12-Sep-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
pretty much

[12-Sep-18 11:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its far less than here... but minimum wage is bullshit anyway, it creates LESS jobs by having it

[12-Sep-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
im supposed to be on centrelink ATM, looking after small children all day...

[12-Sep-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
kunts make it so hard to claim, rather instead have 0 income

[12-Sep-18 11:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at some point they will stop paying out, so may as well figure out how to live without it before that happens

[12-Sep-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
managed to claim 26K off my Super as insurance last year, so wont lose any of that in a stock Market crash, plus its all in Gold and Energy stocks.

Regarding intrest rates, why would anyone take adjustable rates in times with rates at an all time low? Arent you better off locking that shit down for the following 10-20 years?

[12-Sep-18 11:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Myself... there was no option to take a fixed rate, as I used a government backed "no deposit loan"

[12-Sep-18 11:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But I also only spent less than 1/5th the average price.

[12-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, I see a lot of friends taking them as well when they also have the option to take fixed rate loans

[12-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And when I ask them why they just say it's cheaper now

[12-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
'Do you think rates will always stay this low?'

[12-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
We'll see when we get there

[12-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
lol

[12-Sep-18 11:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol... I figured that they would just not raise it as it would crash the economy... they gone too far to go back now üòÑ

[12-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They have to turn em up, or the mismatch between financial markets and real economy becomes too big

[12-Sep-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
isnt that already the case ?

[12-Sep-18 11:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for a few years now

[12-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Up to a certain degree yes

[12-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But now they can still fix it without causing too much pain

[12-Sep-18 11:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
question is do they want to?

[12-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yep

[12-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem is you have elections every 4-5 years, which doesnt incentivise the powers that be to take sensible long term decisions

really is pointless voting here... so they made it cumpolsory and a $50 fine if you dont vote... but if you never sign up, they never fine you.

centralized govt health agencies rubber stamping the latest greatest treatment because of corruption should be a huge deal but it's not sad;y

[12-Sep-18 11:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe we need verifiable and immutable decentralized but anonymous treatment results to grade medical device products?
