Shit, we‚Äôve climbed back up the cmc to 64 from like 69 the other day, even at these shitty ATL prices.

[05-Sep-19 08:46 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, was certainly a gamble, particularly when CZ tweets a few days ago something like ‚Äúbe safe out there!!! Use a yubi key, don‚Äôt loose funds!!‚Äù

Price jumped but only on one exchange CoinEx which reports highest volume. Could be fake volume, not sure. If other exchanges will not follow, it‚Äôs gonna be just a short lived p‚Äôn‚Äôd.

About this openmarketcap: What is this NVT score they have? Higher the score, the more speculative the token. Komodo NVT 188.521. Matic is lowest one with NVT 3.121. because Matic isn't speculative token? wtf? If you ask me, I don't think there are something more speculative than unofficial off-chain eth dapps scaling solution. ü§î

Maybe (may not) in October altcoins trend reversal could happen.

This is my current analysis for $ETH (along with many other  altcoins that are forming falling wedges) üìä

I think $ETH may see a slight decline for September, but if Bitcoin manages to follow the pump I've called, I predict an alt season to begin by the end of September...

maybe this NVT marketcap/volume metric is something. Kmd seem to be there in the middle and there are many coins higher up with lot less trading volume than kmd.

I think utrum doesnt get enough credit as a kmd project. It has been the most consistent in delivering what has been promised. @Sri is a very well dedicated guy who has made ends meet since the very beginning.

It has been such kind of ride for us. We delivered on all our promises, be it Hold rewards and now Portal itself which is a social network and one stop place for reviews, predictions, insights and reports. Now that we  launched the portal, sole focus is marketing now.

@grewalsatinder opinion on eos ?

[05-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Caglio#3337
i have strong urge to buy eos for some reason, i know ur not financial mastermind, but asking from a dev point of view

[05-Sep-19 01:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't heard much good about EOS and couldn't find much in favour of EOS

[05-Sep-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from dev point of view, it sounds worst than ETH

[05-Sep-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the point here is what is your reason to hold some cryptocurrency.

[05-Sep-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
as I understand there must be only 2

[05-Sep-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
- being a developer you develop using that project

[05-Sep-19 01:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
- being an investor you want you portfolio value increase using that project's tokens hoping it's adoption and value will increase over time

[05-Sep-19 01:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so, let's also go over the investment part of thoughts

treasure 

[05-Sep-19 01:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is rank 8 on CMC
market cap 3,046,520,927 USD
total supply 1,027,143,468 EOS 
circulating 930,443,457 EOS 
1,027,143,468 - 930,443,457 = 96700011 yet to be produced
so about 90% of the total supply is already in market

[05-Sep-19 01:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
CMC shows the lowest price of about 8400+ sats, and top ever about 201k+ sats, and current 30k+ sats

[05-Sep-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
seeing some points mentioned in the article I linked, like few block producers and recent months showing some news on EOS and few other's devs expressing the concerns in the technical parts is one thing which is from developer point if view I don't like.
from investor point of view, it took an year to complete an ICO, and that is too much long time to for an ICO. Kinda ridiculously long! Chances of manipulation with the raising money during the ICO and inflating the value of token is very high even in case we trust there isn't. But probability says it's high.
Also, if you calculate the value it's each token is worth based on how much supply is there in the market and it's total supply number, you

[05-Sep-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you'll see it's extremely overvalued

[05-Sep-19 01:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's also go with the value assessment as I see

[05-Sep-19 01:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Goddamn it, now when u put it this way, i dont want to buynit, but instead get rid of mine :/ continue pls

[05-Sep-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just try to see what a project is giving in value to market and what it's current price is

[05-Sep-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so let's calculate some numbers

[05-Sep-19 01:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if I have 1 BTC and need to decide where i want to put in what I'd do

[05-Sep-19 01:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and remember, the goal is only to raise the cryptocurrency overall value of the portfolio and NOT FIAT!

[05-Sep-19 01:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
because in long term FIAT is NOT GOOD

[05-Sep-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and you can think of shuffling the cryptocurrency value from one to another as per your favourite cryptocurrency

[05-Sep-19 01:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
be it BTC, ETH, KMD, etc etc

[05-Sep-19 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if I take it to count for BTC to raise in value in long term, I'll just think about BTC value in the potential

[05-Sep-19 01:23 PM] dan.#2473
one things for sure, selling kmd and rebuying kmd is a surefire way to get more :troll_lol:

current price of EOS 0.00030941 BTC

[05-Sep-19 01:24 PM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder well I do want to obtain more fiat, not more crypto, I got some extra cash at the moment, so I care more about pure fiat price than satoshi movement

[05-Sep-19 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so 1 BTC / 0.00030941 per EOS BTC price = 3231.95759671 EOS in total

[05-Sep-19 01:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Caglio sure, can cover that view as well

[05-Sep-19 01:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so at this moment, if 1 BTC is used to buy you'll roughly get around 3200+ EOS

[05-Sep-19 01:26 PM] dan.#2473
definitely need to commit to either fiat or btc. its a lot like shooting a basketball and aiming for the backboard or the hoop to swoosh it in. gotta pick one or you'll miss.

[05-Sep-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if I compare it with the project like KMD what will I get:
current KMD price 0.00006431 BTC
1 BTC / 0.00006431 per KMD price in BTC = 15549.68123153 KMD

[05-Sep-19 01:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
total supply of KMD ever going to be 200,000,000+ million

[05-Sep-19 01:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's also check on ETH, coz after BTC that's mostly ppl's favorite

[05-Sep-19 01:28 PM] dan.#2473
15k kmd, lol
