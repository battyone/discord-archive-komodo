if we want to get money and not btc

[05-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
well bitcoin wont be everything so it doesnt rly matter what sats value rly is

[05-Aug-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
quite sure the world wont apart from a centralized currency ever

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
so there might just be a global fiat currency sooner or later

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Who knows what happens

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Honestly I dont see bitcoin going away

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
I could see alts, or shitcoins however u prefer them to

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
to go away

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
bitcoin wont go away but it wont be money also

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
it will be store of value

[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats true

[05-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464
crypto also wont go away, its the new shit

[05-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but I was saying this year ago

[05-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464
companies might even issue their own coin later that act as a stock

[05-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Shitcoins shitcoins shitcoins

[05-Aug-19 02:05 PM] Caglio#3337
Who needs this much coins

[05-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Caglio#3337
noone needs em

[05-Aug-19 02:06 PM] Markus#5464
to me having a company stock on a blockchain sounds pretty good

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
Yup

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
I prefer the way it was back in 2017

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
with 500 coins and money spread over them

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
not now on 2500 coins

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
and growing up every day

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Markus#5464
well idk if u can count all 2500 as coins....hundreds if not even more then 1k are probably abandoned

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] Caglio#3337
because world cannot exists without such amazing projects

[05-Aug-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there are closer to 25000 coins

[05-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
anyway you understand my point

[05-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
every day, a new great coin pops out

[05-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Caglio#3337
while 30 of them dont have a real life use

[05-Aug-19 02:08 PM] Markus#5464
Sure everyone want to try to be apart of the evolution

[05-Aug-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337
it is very good for all who have those coins

[05-Aug-19 02:12 PM] Caglio#3337
overall helps the price to go down

[05-Aug-19 02:14 PM] joe2x4#5987
Altcoins have a very big use, you spend your Bitcoins on them. Without altcoins, Bitcoin would just be cashed back out to fiat. Off course 25 new shitcoins a day need to be created, what you think things like BBQcoin actually had value? If Satoshi didn't want alt coins, he wouldn't have made Bitcoin open source. Satoshi knew what would happen.

[05-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah ?

[05-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
so when btc was 1 cent value

[05-Aug-19 02:15 PM] Caglio#3337
he was about 1000 other shitcoins that will be traded 1000 : 1

[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
I certainly doubt that

[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
supply and demand

[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
if u value it like that

[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, it could be traded with existing 400-500 coins, even tho with 30 coins

[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] Caglio#3337
No need for millions of them

[05-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
its just begin

[05-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
wait 3 years

[05-Aug-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
u will have probably 1 million coins

[05-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
Well this way

[05-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
We will either have million coins, or really few

[05-Aug-19 02:18 PM] Caglio#3337
I think both options are up now

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
so if kmd will stay in top 100 when there is thousands if not hunded thousands of coins.....thats pretty damn good

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
True, but maybe we wont be top 100 in a month

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
And also

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
u think short time frames

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
As far as I am concerned if we were top 10 now

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
nothing happen over a night

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
With this price and value, I wouldnt care

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
give it time

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
I gave it almost 2 years now

[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Nothing good happened

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I am not being salty now, just real

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Caglioâ€™s farewell speech

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
nah I am on this ship until it sinks

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
im sure there is things cooking what they dont even tell us.....not all partnerships are being announced before right moment as example

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
If ur talking about KMD, I dont care really

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
We are not getting back at ath

[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] Caglio#3337
I doubt even 5$

[05-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
unless btc moons to few milions

[05-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464
and if we do then what?

[05-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
We wont, so no worries about that

[05-Aug-19 02:21 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean, not in a normal timeframe

[05-Aug-19 02:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
why should a partnership be a big deal anyway? attaching your dev project to the boat anchor of corporate bureacracy seems like a dumb idea to me.

[05-Aug-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
so question is why u guys even invest into kmd when ur so bearish and negative about it ?

[05-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
I wasnt been so bearish and negative before

[05-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
Being inside this discord and finding out some stuff

[05-Aug-19 02:24 PM] Caglio#3337
totally killed it for me

[05-Aug-19 02:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
Caglio is a fed

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I understand price is out of our hands

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
But I was so bullish on ltc, my first coin

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I still have it

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
It dropped down and all, but I am still fine with it

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Even tho I hated charlie @ one moment

[05-Aug-19 02:25 PM] Markus#5464
ltc is fkn garbage compared to kmd, what usecase do ltc have? u can trade and pay with it and thats it

[05-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Beauty ? Hm I dont agree with that, beauty passes by soon, about technology as being beautiful... well maybe to some

[05-Aug-19 02:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
just having a wallet and a pr team seems to be all you need right now. this will change though.

[05-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
crypto is in such a early stage

[05-Aug-19 02:28 PM] Markus#5464
even if bitcoin exist since 10 years, crypto overall is just getting started

[05-Aug-19 02:30 PM] Caglio#3337
Passes by?

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] p.#1126

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] p.#1126
Dont want that

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Caglio#3337
Beauty passes yeah

[05-Aug-19 02:31 PM] Caglio#3337
