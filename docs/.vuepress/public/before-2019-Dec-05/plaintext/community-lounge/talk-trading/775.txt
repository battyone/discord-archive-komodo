[18-Jun-19 11:17 PM] yorklab#7270
@Vertigo There's a large sell wall on Bittrex that's keeping it down. I went to Coinexchange and noticed their wallets on both OOT and KMD are back up. I'm beginning to wonder what's going on with Binance.

[18-Jun-19 11:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
binance is at the eye of the storm right now. I'm sure they are in the shit up to their eyeballs now that even clueless politicians are starting to understand what is happening.

Are you not using a VPN?

[19-Jun-19 03:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
AKA rawdoggin' the internet?

[19-Jun-19 03:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you are, you should sign up and pledge to begin using a VPN.   Don't worry, noone will know you're doing it to pay for porn because you will hopefully be able to pay with $ARRR.  In addition, we are giving users 1 year free if the provider decides to accept $ARRR as a payment option.

While Facebook's Libra doesn't compete against any open, public, permissionless, borderless, neutral, censorship-resistant blockchains, it *will* compete against both retail banks and central banks. This is going to be fun to watch.

you can't really scam if you are the buyer

[19-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
you don't even need to take anything with you to the meet

[19-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 11:16 AM] Tek#5253

One big thing to highlight is that libra has a programming environment. As long as it has a timer and hash... We can perform atomic swaps and FB can't stop anyone entering the "crypto" market. https://t.co/qZovt3fcBi
