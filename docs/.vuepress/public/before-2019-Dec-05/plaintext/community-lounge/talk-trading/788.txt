I'm quite certain in America you'd definitely serve time for that.

[20-Jun-19 08:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Well in America of the past, if you make enough money through the sponsorship you can buy your way out of jail.

[20-Jun-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt there legal paperworks that make it all ok?

[20-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and there was no legal proof that bitconnect was a ponzi, until very late in the game

[20-Jun-19 08:38 PM] dan.#2473
sometimes, didnt turn out good for bernie tho

[20-Jun-19 08:38 PM] BlackJesus#6161
plausible deniability?

[20-Jun-19 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt any company with a good legal staff will have any troubles for an unconvicted customer

[20-Jun-19 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810

Blackjesus says anyone who accepts advertising revenue has a legal responsibility to due diligence the business of said advertiser. Where'd you come up with that? Your feelings? It's definitely not the law. Nor should it be.

Serve time?!

[20-Jun-19 08:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Maybe I'm confusing endorsements with advertising. You do have a due diligence for the former.

[20-Jun-19 08:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
People have been held liable for endorsing products that end up being scams

How is hosting adverts not in the same vein as endorsing.

[20-Jun-19 08:47 PM] allbits#5898
What a bizarre world you're proposing. Nobody would be able to accept advertising

[20-Jun-19 08:49 PM] allbits#5898
Meanwhile in the real world, actual knowledge of the fraud and/or proof of a common purpose would be required to impose liability, especially to "serve time"

[20-Jun-19 08:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So if my likeness was of value and I could attach it to products at will for compensation (trump tower i.e.). I'm not liable at all to do any due diligence before signing the contract?!?! @allbits So at worst I'll just suffer some mild backlash from endorsing a bad product.

[20-Jun-19 08:52 PM] dan.#2473
i dont think this situation is black and white

[20-Jun-19 08:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm honestly curious.

[20-Jun-19 08:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Please do explain allbits

[20-Jun-19 08:56 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I guess what I'm arguing is liability for those who perpetuate a scam knowingly or unknowingly.

[20-Jun-19 08:56 PM] allbits#5898
will only be liable if the injured party can prove all of the elements of negligence liability: duty, reliance, breach of duty (negligence), injury, and causation. If any one of these five elements cannot be established, then liability will not result. The case law in this area leads to the conclusion that absent some significant involvement or control, assumption of responsibility, or clear negligence, is not likely to be held liable for its good faith endorsement of vendor products or services

[20-Jun-19 08:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So they kind of have a good Samaritan clause for hosting adverts?

[20-Jun-19 08:57 PM] allbits#5898
That's for a civil claim. "Serving time" would require actual knowledge and/or a common purpose

[20-Jun-19 08:57 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's what im pulling from your "not likely to be held liable for its good faith endorsement of vendor products or services
".

[20-Jun-19 08:57 PM] allbits#5898
Coinmarketcap.wasn't anywhere near any of this

[20-Jun-19 08:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I was wrong on the criminal accusation of CMC.

[20-Jun-19 08:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yeah CMC isn't visited by me much anymore

[20-Jun-19 09:00 PM] allbits#5898
Hosting advertisements is way in the clear. You shifted to talking about endorsements so I answered that

[20-Jun-19 09:01 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Based on the precedence set by the telemarketing industry it's still hard for me to not argue that running Advertisements is not a form Endorsing.

[20-Jun-19 09:02 PM] dan.#2473
what if the adverts were for harvesting baby organs

[20-Jun-19 09:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I mean its why PBS doesnt run porn ads :/

[20-Jun-19 09:02 PM] BlackJesus#6161
They don't want to be associated with it or endorse it.

[20-Jun-19 09:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
porn ads would pay more money would they not?

[20-Jun-19 09:05 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@dan.  I would assume the channel or station I was watching endorsed that behavior.

[20-Jun-19 09:06 PM] dan.#2473
yeah, it was a rhetorical question. I dont think this is black and white.

[20-Jun-19 09:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yeah it's a grey area but liability can be argued for it.

[20-Jun-19 09:06 PM] dan.#2473
if anyone thinks its a free market so baby organ ads are ok, you can fuck off

[20-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Tek#5253
where can I buy some baby organs

[20-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Tek#5253
I could use some rejuvenation juice

[20-Jun-19 09:07 PM] dan.#2473
probably many places

[20-Jun-19 09:07 PM] BlackJesus#6161

[20-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Tek#5253
rumour is if you torture them first the blood fills with endorphins and if you eat the baby organs then you get super high

"Liability can be argued for it" only by ambulance chasers or internet "experts" with no knowledge of the field

[20-Jun-19 09:10 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Are you a lawyer @allbits? I mean this is the internet you can be anything you want bro.

[20-Jun-19 09:10 PM] dan.#2473
yes i used the extreme on purpose. there has to be some lines drawn somewhere

altho the majority would agree its criminal and evident, the fact that its criminal is still subjective

[20-Jun-19 09:12 PM] dan.#2473
so what is criminal

[20-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Tek#5253

[20-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Tek#5253
> dealing with plebs

[20-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Tek#5253
then ask the pleb to sell you a child

[20-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Tek#5253

rumours of a 2k candle online

[20-Jun-19 09:53 PM] Tek#5253
You don goofed.

You don't even know what you missed out. I am so fuckin thankful my coworker got me involved in btc back in 2015, i literally owe him everything. My initial goal was ok lets get 1.0, then 10 then..... you get it.

We are at the point of FAST take off. What i mean is it is creeping up daily, but we haven't had a 2k candle yet....we will. it is going to get aggressive fast. 

i truly truly hope most of you out there have 1.0 or much more. for those doubting btc and the direction its headed, i hope you find a way to cope when you look back and think "man if i only put in $1000 in 2016".... 

And for you bears, now what? Facebook (in the eyes of normies) legitimized the space. libra is still a shit coin, people will research libra and then instantly find bitcoin. you think they WONT invest in btc after reading about its magical powers?

Silly no BTC anons, you're life is going to suck in 3 years or less.

I'd be happy if it goes down, i'd buy more. Now, I'm planning to buy some KMD but I'm waiting that a bottom is drawn a bit

[20-Jun-19 10:00 PM] Flexatron#8809

Iâ€™m more confident in ETH

[20-Jun-19 10:13 PM] Tek#5253
Yeah its either xmr or eth thats gonna make a massive green candle or a few

[20-Jun-19 10:14 PM] Tek#5253
I think xmr has more chance cause ETH has too many projects dumping all the time for funding ( ico 's )

[20-Jun-19 10:15 PM] Tek#5253
but once ETH starts mooning and it breaks like 0.036 its gonna go straight to 0.056 cause gamblers have million dollar shorts on ETH

[20-Jun-19 10:16 PM] blubbi#0643
i would bet on xmr
