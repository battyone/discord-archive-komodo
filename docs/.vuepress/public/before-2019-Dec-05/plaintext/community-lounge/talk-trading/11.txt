@ComputerGenie good to have you back

It'll be a bit before I'm "truly" back, but I will be in chat a bunch more now

I am 12 days without a BLTN notatization, looks like the chain is dead, no transactions. üòï

[21-Jun-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would there be a way to make liquidity and matching easier for our dex? Say person A wants to swap from ARK to OMG. 
Instead of just putting up an order to sell ark for omg, would the system be able to bring in person B and C?

So if person A is wanting to swap ARK to OMG, and no current orders available. 
Person B wants to go from OMG to NEO. 
Person C wants NEO to ARK. 
Would a system be able to be implemented where person A B and C are automatically matched and swapped? Seeing as fees are low enough for multiple trades to reach the endgoal outcome?

I dont know if im talking out my ass my brains a bit sizzled atm. 
But I think it makes sense? LOL

[21-Jun-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Il try simplify it. Persons 1 2 and 3. Tokens a b and c. 

Person 1 wants to swap a to b
2 wants b to c
3 wants c to a

1 gives 2 his A, 2 gives 3 his c, and 3 gives 1 his A

[21-Jun-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
So like a way to match 3 or 4 people together and either automatically have the coins swapped to respective wallets, or for it to be done automatically but through the whole process. So 1 and 2 swap, then 2 and 3, then 3 and 1

[21-Jun-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would that make liquidity a lot higher? Momom? Matching of matching of match? üòÇ 
Or even having an order sold for bitcoin/kmd, then that coin to coin wanted, except its all automated so as long as bitcoin or kmd (or any coin) is a major pair or has better liquidity than other coins, it would help out more obscure pairs like if someone wanted to swap EXP for STRAT or some low volume coins together

[21-Jun-18 01:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just having it as an option like "allow double trade" or someshit

[21-Jun-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <tolken> i‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äùm following, but it sounds like you‚Äôre looking for a way to add dependencies to the trades, dependencies between multiple parties.

[21-Jun-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <tolken> Maybe what you‚Äôre looking for is a sort of routing mechanism. The thing with BarterDex presently, is that if such a multi step path exists with online/active liquidity providers, it‚Äôs just a matter of the client barterdex api user finding that route an executing it. Writing a bot that would do that might not be terribly difficult. You‚Äôd need to listen to the peer network and see what pairs do exist, what the utxo/liquidity of the various players are.  With low liquidity, this will still be a bit challenging and frustrating if machines don‚Äôt remain on continuously.

[21-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah i dont really know tbh just throwing out ideas. I meant for it to more be a future fearure for barterdex, because I can see it multiplying liquidity many many times. I dont know how something like this would work or be programmed in but i presume itd be like the ai of chess or something where it looks for all possible routes/trades available and then executes? üòÇ idk

[21-Jun-18 03:37 AM] gcharang#6833
I think it's  a nice idea  which can work if zero-conf trades are leveraged while programming it.

[21-Jun-18 03:52 AM] tolken#2655
you're likely only one pair away from where you'll want to be at any given time though. So SHIT token to ETH, ETH to KMD or example. That's more likely than finding a SHIT to UMR (unidefintified mushroom coin) UMR to ETH, ETH to KMD.

[21-Jun-18 03:55 AM] tolken#2655
Its an interesting problem. All of these obscure coins whine about not being on big exchanges.. but when exchanges hold every coin, what's going to make listing one over another special? Bdex will trade any pair. I'd imagine there will be a dominant REL, maybe not BTC, but who knows - maybe KMD will actually become the most popular on Bdex, despite not being 'forced' to use it üòâ

[21-Jun-18 03:56 AM] tolken#2655
maybe 'become' is the wrong word, i mean remain.

[21-Jun-18 03:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yep but if we want it to be as user friendly as possible, last thing we want is 100 people complaining they cant trade their shitcoin for another coin üòÇ instead of forcing them to go through and see what shitcoin to shitcoin to wanted coin trade, if it was automated itd help heaps with that and liquidity. If kmd became a major pair,and if it had orders for most or all coins, then anyone could technically go from coin to coin by leveraging the main coin

Eg. Shitcoin -> kmd -> coin wanted

{Reactions}
üòÅ 

[21-Jun-18 03:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
As long as kmd or the main pair has good liquidity, then other coins could use that to act as person c so coin to coin would seem easier on the user end

[21-Jun-18 05:00 AM] tolken#2655
I hear ya. Just don't see all shit coin getting any volume without mr shitcoin dev possibly making a shit/kmd  and/or shit/btc pair to get the ball rolling. All the fancy stuff we just discussed won't help one bit unless someone, somewhere, wants to fulfill a shit trade.

[21-Jun-18 05:02 AM] tolken#2655
Considering ERC-20 is supported in bdex now, that opens the door to a wide variety of shit/pairs. Once someone has komodod running, every eth token is at their fingertips to provide liquidity.

[21-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Ary#9754
will kmd be as dank as eth?

the only way to fix the issues caused by not enough bobs, is to get more bobs

[21-Jun-18 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
anything else is trying to fix one thing by fixing something else

[21-Jun-18 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as there is a common trading pair, ie. vs. KMD, then there will be a one hope path from any coin to any other. we dont force people to use KMD, but the natural inertia will make KMD the most active. unless some other coin takes the initiative to make all the liquid bob pairs

[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Utrum is a good project. A lot will come off it

[21-Jun-18 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> PRLPAY seems to have a great market niche in the Philippines

[21-Jun-18 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> And GLX might become a huge thing too.

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> In a bear market like this one, we are going to need to wait to see the true potential of many projects.

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Imo KMD is getting more attention during the bear than what it did during the bull, which imo is a great thing since its taking the attention from the people that matter

That's what we want :)

[slack] <pondsea> Well TRX and Tron could dump to 1 satoshi, that might brighten up my day

[21-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CHMEX> It might when the chain reaches 20TB on SSD or when the contract? which freezes the TRX for voting cracks.

[21-Jun-18 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Or something uses the 1tb ram lol

[21-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <chmex:matrix.org> Yes the RAM specs are killing it aswell.
Also in order to convert your erc20 to TRX you have to deposit it on a exchange before the 26th or something apparently no outside of a CEX convertion for the moment. Than getting it out of the CEX there are 300 TRX fee plus showing of the chicken

[21-Jun-18 12:59 PM] CHMEX#0686
They are asking for the supernodes to have 20TB SSD standby

Now, you know now that you said that, if it gets hacked KMD will get blamed üòõ

[21-Jun-18 01:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
That was on one of the docs. They call it SuperRepresentative they have similar benefit lile notaries on kmd they can mine the blocks voted each 6 hours. At least last time I readit the docs and specs change each day.

[21-Jun-18 01:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
Somehow it has some java interface and the whole thing runs on java not that there is something wrong about it I just dont understand it...
Ow and their aim is 1000 payments per second

[21-Jun-18 01:04 PM] CHMEX#0686
I think its big on marketing and they hired some 300 devs... anyhow thats my 2 cents on Tron

[21-Jun-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
300 devs?

[21-Jun-18 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be a horrible mess with 300 devs

[21-Jun-18 01:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
massive amount of devs always works; just look at how awesome the first 1500 builds of Win 10 are üòú

[21-Jun-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to write a good novel. having 300 writers is not sane

[21-Jun-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there are very, very few projects that an fair well with more than a couple dozen devs and eve fewer that can do so with that many full-time devs

[21-Jun-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org>  > [discord] <jl777c> its like trying to write a good novel. having 300 writers is not sane

Are you saying the bible is not sane? :troll:

[21-Jun-18 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not to mention the management delegation nightmare that 300 would create

[21-Jun-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
90% of bugs will be written by the bottom 10%, which in this case are 30!

[21-Jun-18 01:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And the idea behind BNTN is also great, especially since they already have a working product and customer base

[21-Jun-18 01:31 PM] Jazzy#0001
I dunno, you can make perfectly good things with 300 devs but not if they're all working on the same product

[21-Jun-18 01:31 PM] Jazzy#0001
But if you have 10 devs on blockchain dev, 15 on wallet, 15 on app dev, etc

[21-Jun-18 01:32 PM] Jazzy#0001
Then you can actually product a large number of things at scale

[21-Jun-18 01:32 PM] Jazzy#0001
But you'd probably need another 15% extra people just to manage it

[21-Jun-18 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
broken down to parts, maybe; but like I said, that's a nightmare to delegate (and exponentially more difficult with each typeA in the mix, because they will want to move cross-project with things in A that create issues in B)

[21-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Jazzy#0001
lmao how many type A devs do you know

[21-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Jazzy#0001
And how many do you think Tron could actually hire?

[21-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Jazzy#0001
That's the real question I suppose

[21-Jun-18 01:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
almost all of them üòõ

[21-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Jazzy#0001
Maybe it a regional thing, but almost none of the devs I know are type a

[21-Jun-18 01:36 PM] Jazzy#0001
But then almost nobody in this country is type a

[21-Jun-18 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[21-Jun-18 01:41 PM] Jazzy#0001

Texas?

[21-Jun-18 01:41 PM] Jazzy#0001
UK

[21-Jun-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Yeah, if you think the UK lacks Type A people, then you need to get out of the house more often

[21-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Jazzy#0001
I think we have Type A people, but I think the vast majority of native brits are not them

[21-Jun-18 01:43 PM] Jazzy#0001
