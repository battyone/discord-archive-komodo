[17-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
He is just trolling for fun

[17-Oct-18 08:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is probably the whale himself (buy and sell)

[17-Oct-18 08:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He is forcing  people to sell before his wall

[17-Oct-18 08:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
so that people will sell into his buy wall?

[17-Oct-18 08:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah

[17-Oct-18 08:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020

[17-Oct-18 08:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020

[17-Oct-18 08:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
At the mercy of the whales üòÉ

[17-Oct-18 08:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
For that sort of money I‚Äôm sure they would have a strategy

[17-Oct-18 08:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
That*

[17-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Mark81#4505
They want to avoid getting over 20ksat. For sure.

[17-Oct-18 08:30 AM] dokrates#8987
yes

[17-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Daniel CP#2020
why tho? why suppress the price?

[17-Oct-18 08:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
TA people will enter

[17-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Mark81#4505
Now they are too close to get any chances for accumulating.

[17-Oct-18 08:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
20k is a key area

[17-Oct-18 08:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If he wants to buy he should put that sell wall higher and the buy wall close to market price

[17-Oct-18 08:32 AM] ph03nix#3115
it might be his cat

[17-Oct-18 08:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Hmm both walls back 20 sats apart

[17-Oct-18 08:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and someone eating his sell wall LOL

[17-Oct-18 08:33 AM] dokrates#8987
understandable

[17-Oct-18 08:33 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:33 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[17-Oct-18 08:33 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:34 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:34 AM] dokrates#8987

[17-Oct-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
whale market bought 200 BTC worth?

[17-Oct-18 08:35 AM] BlockTech#6895
130BTC i think.

[17-Oct-18 08:35 AM] Mark81#4505
Ouh he is in trouble....

[17-Oct-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
hollowman killed it?

[17-Oct-18 08:36 AM] snowdamn#2414
don't ask how much the üê≥ bought, but how much it is planning to make!!!  üòÄ

[17-Oct-18 08:38 AM] BlockTech#6895
Invest 350BTC today, get out with 35'000BTC in 2021,, nice ROI ^^

[17-Oct-18 08:38 AM] snowdamn#2414
100x is fine by me

[17-Oct-18 08:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Forcing the fish into the channel üòõ

[17-Oct-18 08:38 AM] dokrates#8987
he needs to buy all to 21k sat and all of his buy wall will be filled üòõ

[17-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Mark81#4505
It started when he's big buy wall were cornered near 20k and couldnt get price down without selling to others buy orders .

[17-Oct-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
I think there is less than 50 BTC on the sell side to 50k sats

[17-Oct-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the sell side is a dynamically bot created illusion to force the price down

[17-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Mark81#4505
I think best thing he could do now is to get out off market and fight on another day.

[17-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Mark81#4505
Or then just clean sell side with massive pump.

[17-Oct-18 08:44 AM] dokrates#8987
move the sellwall to 21k

[17-Oct-18 08:44 AM] dokrates#8987
he must clean sell side to 21k and then get out and wait, otherwise he is not going to take more coins around this price

[17-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Mark81#4505
Its not easy to be whale. üòÇ

[17-Oct-18 08:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
if only üê≥ were as patient when dumping...

[17-Oct-18 08:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
we're flirting with 20K again, will be interesting to see whether the whale pushes price back down

[17-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Daniel CP#2020

20k buy wall getting hit

[17-Oct-18 10:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Very little sells though, only 10k of 1m lol

[17-Oct-18 10:09 AM] BlockTech#6895
every time he put/take off his wall, he actually spend 100$ of fee. (Edit, didn't knew but No fee is order is not filled)

[17-Oct-18 10:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
why?

[17-Oct-18 10:11 AM] dokrates#8987
really? there is a fee just to put and remove the wall?

[17-Oct-18 10:11 AM] dokrates#8987
i don't think so

[17-Oct-18 10:11 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
bots would be bamkrupt lol

[17-Oct-18 10:11 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
you only pay fees if order gets filled

[17-Oct-18 10:11 AM] dokrates#8987
exactly

[17-Oct-18 10:14 AM] dokrates#8987
