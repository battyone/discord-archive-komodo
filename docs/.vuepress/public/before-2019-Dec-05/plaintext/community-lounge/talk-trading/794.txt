Im not but i have no option

[21-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Malti#3948
might sell my XMR for KMD when we hit 12k

[21-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
I soldall my kmd short after the wallet hack news came out

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
this dumpening has nothing to do with the hack

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
all alts are getting rekt

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
look at Strat, XLM even, ARK

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
rekt rekt rekt

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Tek#5253
it does'nt, but it didn't dump after the hack either, while it should have

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Tek#5253
so now it will dump extra hard

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
why

[21-Jun-19 12:20 PM] Malti#3948
lol that makes no sense

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
it makes no sense people should dump when a hack happens? funds where not safe, imagine if you had 20k kmd and the hacker got it

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Who here is in to Elastos?

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
holding kmd was dangerous.

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948
but it was prevented

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
better of having it on an exchange

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948
lessons learned

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Markus#5464
actually kmd was overbought during wallet hack period so it made sense to go down, maybe not this much but btc now being reason and also possibly US ppl cant use binance

[21-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Malti#3948
lessons that are still to be learned at other projects

[21-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Malti#3948
if anything I'd rather put my money now in Agama than in a wallet that was not yet hacked

[21-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[21-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Malti#3948
yes because Binance is unhackable

[21-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Malti#3948
...

[21-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I expect people with large amounts of KMD were not using Agama lite node. Anyone with that type of money will go extra security and use native or CLI.

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
bro I could have been financially ruined if the hacker got my kmd

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Neither of those were effected by the hack.

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
and many other people also thought kmd was safe

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
a safe hold

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Malti#3948
KMD blockchain is safe

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
the wallet wasn't

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Malti#3948
which is your choice to use

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Malti#3948
code is open source

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
agama was recommended by the kmd team

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Malti#3948
so if you're so concerned, then check the source code

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It was a safe hold as long as you didn't use lite node.

[21-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
lmao almost no one runs a full node

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
lets not forget 10 mil kmd was compromised

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
10% of the supply was comprimsed

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
that they know of

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I do and my funds were part of the "safe" crowd.

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
and 10% of that 10% was hacked

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We need a capitulation

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A fat finger

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Malti#3948
seems like a good ratio to me

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Markus#5464
most of ppl probably use a hardware wallet

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
it wasn't safe man. I put all my trust into this and I could have gotten my funds stolen. It would be more safe to just hold on binance

[21-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
I could have been destroyed, and some people did get destroyed

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Someone who gives up and sells his stash for whatever price

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
they didn't

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
jl put the funds up

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
still a price drop was warrented

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
like i said I like how they handled it but still

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Sherdogz#6731
@Tek  if you'd be financially ruined by that hack you arent diversified enough

[21-Jun-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The selloff didnt happen before because most people hold kmd off exchanges to accrue interest

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once they noticed the hack it was to late to deposit to exchanges

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So now they are exiting

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Malti#3948
I showed the documentation of KMD to my developers today

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
actually I did manage to send to binance before deposits were closed

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Malti#3948
they have been quietly reading since

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
and my adress was compromised

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Stupid move at this point imo, but what do i know

[21-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
i used the seed 1 week earlier

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It seems like we are doing the final wave C of the whole correction since 2017

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Tek#5253
does it mean moon?  : D

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Malti#3948
i assume siu is talking elliot waves

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not before an ATL imo

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yes, elliott waves

[21-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Malti#3948
by the way who here goes to K64 event?

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Malti#3948

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Markus#5464
maybe ppl should look at this before saying this dump is cause of the hack

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Malti#3948
if you weren't a racist I would carpool with you

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Markus#5464
u can see that btc go up and kmd down

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Malti#3948
:troll:

[21-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
dude ive said already its not dumping because of the hack

[21-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
but it should have

[21-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
so now it has double dump power

[21-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253

Wtf? Jokes? @Tek

[21-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Tek#5253
also if you deny the differnences between the human species you are a brainwashed zombie

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Ooh you're a stormfronter

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Tek#5253
no im a realist

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Markus#5464
no need to be racist

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Tek#5253
environment dictates which genes express themselves and we all dindt grow up in the same environment

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Tek#5253
so we are different

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Tek#5253
we are all dogs

[21-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Tek#5253
