Is that him trolling though?

I fully expect for kmd to release the mobile dex, and for the price to go down as a result. The crypto space makes no sense whatsoever .

the VBK 's Discord sure is a hot place üòÇ

[02-Apr-19 11:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They aren‚Äôt securing anything yet.  Also so far I‚Äôm not quite sure what prevents an attacker from 51% VBK and protected chain simultaneously where they just notarize attackers fake protected chain over the real one.

[02-Apr-19 11:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or have a chain using it so the system can be tested

[02-Apr-19 11:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don‚Äôt understand close source for things that are supposed to be open source (eventually) .

[02-Apr-19 11:35 PM] PTYX#6840
Smells wrong all over. And people not questioning the closed source launch is strange as well

Would like to spawn a chain to test your claims

[02-Apr-19 11:55 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201

How much do you want for a PoP bot?

[02-Apr-19 11:59 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
yeah but i asked you something else.

[03-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
a bot that can do the PoP for me. Like looking at the correct fee and if fees are increasing i need it to be able to built cptf chains

[03-Apr-19 12:01 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
sending btc tx from the pop miner basically

There are several fee estimators for btc, surprise there isn‚Äôt API you could use

[03-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
@polycryptoblog  the is for sure.

[03-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
or better is just to have the current fee+2 and then to be able to build cptf chains or whatever they are called

[03-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201

This project also got sued by Microsoft back in the days, and they won those cases. The allegations were that they stole the microsoft code to create the dll files for their open source OS project. The project proved they coded the same dll by coding themself, since to achive the same result the part of code bits had to go through the same code logic.... something like that... have followed this project for some time when I was doing sys admin jobs for some time back in the days.

I read somewhere recently that hackers been able to put malware code into the USB cables itself. üòÖ 
they don't even need to be the full memory flash drives, just plug the cable to charge or connect another device and get hacked!
