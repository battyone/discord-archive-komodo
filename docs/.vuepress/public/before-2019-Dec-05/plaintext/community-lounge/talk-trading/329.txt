ye possible but dont u think that will change as more and more institutional investors get into the game?

[04-Dec-18 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Dec-18 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually, I think institutional investors will *increase* the volatility because they buy shit just because it exists - I made a killing on UNIT last Nov because them dummys live on FOMO and 0 due diligence

[04-Dec-18 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
sold like $9 worth of UNIT for $1400+ 😛

[04-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Dec-18 05:58 PM] jorian#4555
not too bad

Grand cycle repeat theory
December 15th seems to be the cut off for price drops.
Compared to 2014 crash and the 2 year bear market there are many similarities to now

[05-Dec-18 12:31 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Biggest crashes brought us down 93% and 86%. Right now we held in the middle of nowhere at 82%. People might take out some money after new year to pay taxes and dec/jan has often weak price action / low volume. This is like to bring the price down a notch till around 88% which brings us to ~2200$ (previous resistance on the monthly candle, again this is similar to the 2013 bubble.)
The wick did extend further below. Last line of defense would be previous ATH at 1170$.
1170 is a 94% drop from ATH to old ATH. I expect resistance at the 200weekly MA and strong resistance at previous resistance of old ATH.

[05-Dec-18 03:12 AM] tolken#2655
screw that. Let’s see some killer dApps rolled out on KMD and get more use so it can’t drop.

[05-Dec-18 03:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Working on it.. Theres a few great ideas going around ATM... Just need to get this sapling stuff tested and rolled out and labs chain launched. :D

@blackjok3r might as well use the state to fund...

[05-Dec-18 03:15 AM] tolken#2655
I still haven’t taken the time to learn how this all works. I’m kinda itching to write a game on it though.

[05-Dec-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I could, look after small children full time for last 6-8 months, when my wife was doing this and I was working full time she got a fairly decent pay from the government... I jut never applied for it... Way too hard and rather not have to deal with them, but might need to do it soon sadly.

[05-Dec-18 03:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
A game was my first idea, but the scope is a bit large, just do whatever I can and try thing out, wasted a massive amount of time so far but knowledge is invaluable down the line.

[05-Dec-18 03:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Think for me I will just keep building out on labs and try to teach others and give them a community to dev around. Hopefully things start to move a bit faster, main issue seems to be most people don't have enough time lol

[05-Dec-18 06:32 AM] tolken#2655
I don’t have much time outside my family and 9-5 work. For last couple years I was maybe only getting 5h of sleep at night (so I could try and become financially free from work) which I found isn’t really compatible with my body. Just don’t know how to get ahead without doing something on the side. I truly hope this community will continue to grow and thrive. I will continue to help it do so.

[05-Dec-18 06:33 AM] tolken#2655
I’d much rather use the 9-5 to be building out KMD dApps.

[05-Dec-18 06:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181

@siu - Chainmakers unless they just recycled the first weeks ICO funds to keep buying EOS from themselves and "only" actually raised $200 mil

[05-Dec-18 09:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have seen similar things said.

[05-Dec-18 09:06 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no way to prove for sure, but EOS can clear any doubts just by showing the wallet(s) with the $4 bil

[05-Dec-18 09:06 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Start-up Block.one raised $4 billion, eclipsing all but two of the world's biggest IPOs this year, but the product is not live.

was it just recycled funds?

[05-Dec-18 09:10 PM] jl777c#5810
is it trading at 50% discount to funds on hand?

The fundraising brought in 7.12 million in total ether as of Wednesday night, according to Token Report, a division of blockchain advisory firm New Alchemy. At Thursday's U.S. dollar exchange rate of $576 per ether, the ICO has brought in the equivalent of $4.1 billion. This amount could change depending on the price of ether once the sale closes.

[05-Dec-18 09:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So they had 4bln when eth was at $576

[05-Dec-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
but they were allowed to move the ETH 10 days after the ICO started

[05-Dec-18 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
including being able to sell it
