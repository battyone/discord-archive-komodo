I agree that Komodo need to be explained better, there are plans for total revamp of this

[20-Jul-18 06:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They haven't committed to anything.  No one is throwing their established system away for blockchain tech yet.

[20-Jul-18 06:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
vested or not, either it works or not. They can't change that. Once we have proper migration tools and CC proof of concept, we'll start a campaign to move erc20 to Kmd

[20-Jul-18 06:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
The EEA is kinda committed.  Corporations have employees on their payroll working with ETH developers.  They have sunk money into it, hedge funds will be buying it soon, wallstreet already has its tentacles wrapping around ETH.  ETH is it for a while, man.

[20-Jul-18 06:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
The big money will not fail.  ETH ETF's will come out in a year or two.  Game developers will use ETH for unique item drops.  Everyone is starting to look hard at ETH or they are paying people to start implimenting integration

[20-Jul-18 06:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A chain that can't support the load of one app is going to be used by everyone....

[20-Jul-18 06:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
And, not to beat a dead horse, but big corporations wont sign contracts with people named JL777 or R2D2

[20-Jul-18 06:54 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
for the simply making money it could be true, untill it last. Don't let you be fooled that most of what this space offers NOW is going to survive in the LONG TERM

[20-Jul-18 06:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's why there are independent businesses that will make those contracts for tech integration

[20-Jul-18 06:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
you couldnt get a CEO of a respected company to ever partner or use a product made by an anonymous person who hasnt stepped back/down like Satoshi

[20-Jul-18 06:55 PM] c2k#4915
MYSPACE , AOL, etc were first to mkt too...and corporations committed to them em masse. but better services came along and now AOL  MYSPACE etc are gone.

[20-Jul-18 06:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
as polycryptoblog said there are KMD ecosystem companies making those partnership

[20-Jul-18 06:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
which ones?  Any the average person has heard of?

[20-Jul-18 06:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Go read the EEA list of affiliates.  Its the frigging who's who of fortune 500 companies

[20-Jul-18 06:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
as money continues to pile into ETH the dev's are going to work themselves to death finding ways to scale.  They have so many fortunes to make, they will scale that bitch

[20-Jul-18 06:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
As evident by all those "successful" eth projects

[20-Jul-18 06:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
is there a successful KMD project?

[20-Jul-18 07:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Dpow

[20-Jul-18 07:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Paid over a million out so far

[20-Jul-18 07:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
Because there are successful ETH projects

[20-Jul-18 07:01 PM] yorklab#7270
@meatspoon much of what you said has been echoed before and I think the Komodo team now realizes this so changes are on the way; unfortunately, it will take some time. I think we'll see many improvements/changes between now and end of year.

the success of komodo isnt dependent on big corporations btw

[20-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Meyse#0952
the NEW businesses that arise from the decentralized movement will make it a succes

[20-Jul-18 07:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
Not sure what age demographic yall are from, but I am old enough to remember playing text based computer games on black and white monitors.  The first to market means a lot.  When computers first came on the scene, the first movers dominated for a long time.  Same with electronics, internet, anything tech related.  Shit, even space flight.  ETH is it, gentlemen, for quite some time.

[20-Jul-18 07:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
Maybe, Meyse.  I dunno.  But while those new businesses are promising little green shoots coming out of the ground, next to them is a sapling named ETH

[20-Jul-18 07:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Eth has no scalability, recursive contracts are retarded. And rely entirely on the premise that a coder will not make a mistake because there is no way to rectify it.  Take Gavin wood for instance ,  a simple mistake locked up 100mil+ usd of eth up

[20-Jul-18 07:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I see Ethereum as Komodo testnet

[20-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Meyse#0952
we are early days, eth will run into a wall sooner or later

[20-Jul-18 07:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
for building Dapps, Komodo will be at least an order of magnitude better and more secure. The underlying architecture is completely different.

[20-Jul-18 07:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Casper, sharding 3yrs and still nothing

[20-Jul-18 07:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
more erc20 = more migration to Komodo

[20-Jul-18 07:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
wait when Augur is ported on Kmd, they're already complaining about gas

I remember putting a music casette into a player and run start  commands on commodore 64.. then the data would be read from the tape and ...load... 😂

```Not sure what age demographic yall are from, but I am old enough to remember playing text based computer games on black and white monitors.```

My first introduction was punch cards in college.

[20-Jul-18 07:08 PM] meatspoon#7860
@polycryptoblog  But  things change and are improved.  Protocols are fine tuned, yes?  The haters pooped all over BTC just 7 months ago for expensive tx costs, the ecosystem adjusted to it.  ETH is going to sort out its scalability, one way or another.

[20-Jul-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC wont go away neither will ETH, but why the thinking that they have to be dead? the spread of grassfields doesnt make all the trees go extinct

[20-Jul-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
crypto is very diverse and there will be millions of blockchains

[20-Jul-18 07:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Meyse Yes, ETH will run into a wall, sooner or later.  But its miles down the road from all of the alt coin laggards.  Miles.  And every coin will hit a wall sooner or later, many coins will hit multiple walls.  ETH just has such a huge head start, good marketing, good PR, tons of high priced talent, huge community, etc

[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
And the switch from 512k floppy disks to 2Mb disks was amaaazzingg..

[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
MSFT has thrown countless dollars to create Win10, vs. unix which is developed with much smaller budget. yet both are still here

[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
open source projects are not commercial enterprises

[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
throwing money at development only gets you so far

[20-Jul-18 07:11 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
"Yo dude, this game is on 4 floppydisks mate.. 😎"

[20-Jul-18 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason KMD will survive and thrive long term is that people dont like to pay fees if they dont have to

[20-Jul-18 07:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
I remember Darklands was on like 12 discs

[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
all these projects that try to lock people in to paying fees to create "value", but in open source that just creates future migration

[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
I don't need to be a tech guy to make observations that software and protocols improve

[20-Jul-18 07:13 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Linux doesnt support as much as win10 for the mass... 
I dont see grannies or new kids entering sudo's and gets.. cd .. or ./...

[20-Jul-18 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but that doesnt mean unix will not succeed, not that windows wont

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
all viable crypto projects will survive to some extent, especially ones that reach critical mass

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
like BTC and ETH

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
So succes is that even the dumbest f##k would be able to use it

[20-Jul-18 07:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User Ahh, that non-argument again.  If it is just my limited comprehension that is the problem, why don't you sell a few million KMD to pay someone who knows what the hell they are doing in marketing to produce some copy or a video that can explain to white collar dual degree dimwits like me why their tech is so incredibly awesome

[20-Jul-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but BTC and ETH dont have to fail for KMD to succeed. in fact we leverage BTC hashrate to gain security, why would we want BTC to go away

[20-Jul-18 07:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
You don't find my words to be coherent, Emmanuel?

[20-Jul-18 07:16 PM] riseandfall#3726
That's just matter of time. KMD deserves a much better place. The tech is great.

[20-Jul-18 07:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
Emmanuel's approach is so common for people in this community.  And its very off-putting.  "You simply cant understand our alien tech.  Your puny brain can't comprehend.  Shut up because you do not write code!"  Its so condescending, Emmanuel.

[20-Jul-18 07:18 PM] riseandfall#3726
Comparison Windows / UNIX is not relevant....But i don't think you realize how much UNIX systems are now used (smartphones, servers, and many manyt specific applications).

Not at all.  I never advocated that

So you don't advocate for bitcoin

[20-Jul-18 07:21 PM] meatspoon#7860
Sure I do.  It is wildly different from KMD in a number of ways

[20-Jul-18 07:21 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Some coins are mooning

[20-Jul-18 07:22 PM] riseandfall#3726
Just FYI, I heard about a project caled Factom : they do  propose parralel chains also with notarization in BTC. This project is more focused on data anchoring. They proposed a 2 tokens solution (one *supposed* to be stable - used for notarization - the other used for speculation). To my opinion it's not good to try to offer a stable token. They use DPOS (but they do notarization).

[20-Jul-18 07:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
Big J, here is the deal.  KMD isnt doing well, in a whole lot of ways.  Price action, wallet software, adoption, marketing, etc.  You all know what you need to work on.  As an investor/speculator, I can speak with some degree of authority that you will have some problems attracting people to your project by remaining anonymous (and hence insulated from professional blowback) if your project craters.
