BTC just tried to drop on finex, but price is still supported at 7.7k so we may see a small increase tmrw maybe ?

Last time we felt a fiat pegbot was at 2$ it just was insane when it was released

[23-Jul-18 08:34 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
What is a pegbot?

[23-Jul-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t even know if that exists but basically it buys / sell at a magnitude that stabilize at the end the price to a specific target.

[23-Jul-18 08:35 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Automated trading scripts.. okay..

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
With low volume it seems it is rasily manageable. But if for any reason the volume spikes it could just end up badly

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, some whale uses it to keep the price down while btc is going up

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
then when the whale is full, the pegbot is stopped

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Anything for profits and money ... how low and dark

[23-Jul-18 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Releasing it is key not to be rekt

[23-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Desperate people sell at this price or at least it s my pov

[23-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
For kmd side

[23-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
People expect btc to fly or crash so alts gets lower volume. Perfect time for whales to increase their bags without a lot of risk

[23-Jul-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Releasing it on any btc movement just figuring out any coin is at it s bottom is like a 100% win on mid/long term

[23-Jul-18 08:43 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
many alts are frozen while BTC price not certain

[23-Jul-18 08:44 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also many crypto newbies might be frozen after their 1st ever lifetime dump from 20k to 6k üòÉ

[23-Jul-18 08:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
dead if you buy crypto for credit, if not you may just loose 50% or so

[23-Jul-18 08:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
rarely you loose 100%

[23-Jul-18 08:46 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
I know people that invested life savings in bitconnect for like half a million ‚Ç¨ .. they feel recked..

[23-Jul-18 08:46 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

Why is trading view so bearish on KMD?

[24-Jul-18 02:09 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because KMD is worth 0 sats
