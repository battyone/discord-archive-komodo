Majors like ETH, LTC, BCH, XRP will pump first but only when they break out

[04-Aug-19 03:24 PM] p.#1126
then alts

[04-Aug-19 03:24 PM] p.#1126
but this is all after BTC moons

[04-Aug-19 03:24 PM] p.#1126

[04-Aug-19 03:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
its all about what can scale. half of this speculative garbage doesn't even exist. btc is noob gold that works for one application. the free market isn't pulling the strings anymore. wall st is.

[04-Aug-19 03:56 PM] p.#1126
Yes, but KMD is not the same as ETH

[04-Aug-19 03:56 PM] p.#1126
MAJOR ALT = huge mc, lots of interest

[04-Aug-19 03:56 PM] p.#1126
regular alt/shitcoin = not that

[04-Aug-19 03:56 PM] p.#1126
pretty easy to understand

[04-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Markus#5464
ETH is just a shitcoin like most of other coins with broken tech

[04-Aug-19 03:57 PM] p.#1126
212$ shitcoin vs 0.99$ shit coin

[04-Aug-19 03:58 PM] p.#1126

[04-Aug-19 03:58 PM] p.#1126

[04-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 03:58 PM] p.#1126

[04-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 04:00 PM] Markus#5464
pathetic rly

[04-Aug-19 04:00 PM] p.#1126
ok well then get KMD on coinbase , or take its place at #2 , or stop talking about tech when no one cares

[04-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Markus#5464
why would one even want to get listed on coinbase

[04-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Markus#5464
and why would u even use coinbase in first place

[04-Aug-19 04:01 PM] Markus#5464
maybe if u dont care about privacy then yes

[04-Aug-19 04:02 PM] Markus#5464
cause coinbase sells ur info

[04-Aug-19 04:06 PM] actionslacks#4072

if govt were not so brainless the world would look way better and things could run much smoother when it comes to everything but when money talks then ppl get way too greedy and they cant handle it

If you were in charge of spending almost unlimited of someone elses money would you spend it wisely?

[04-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Markus#5464
let me give a example

[04-Aug-19 04:10 PM] Markus#5464
price of gas where i live have a tax of almost 200%

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its much the same here.

[04-Aug-19 04:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Its so high that they closed all the rail lines to use trucks instead becaise iot makes them more money

[04-Aug-19 04:12 PM] Markus#5464
in my country politics defend it with they want ppl to use the public busses instead of using cars for example, quess what... the companies that run the bus service raise prices of bus tickets and even remove some of the bus routes due to gas price

[04-Aug-19 04:13 PM] Markus#5464
thats well thought situation

[04-Aug-19 04:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[04-Aug-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my uncles freind told me once..  
this is how you solve unemployment, take everyone who has a job and divide their job over the amount of people 

This seems to be the exact thing they are doing

[04-Aug-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
sounds familiar ü§î

[04-Aug-19 04:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when machines do all the work will they pay for all the people to live?

[04-Aug-19 04:21 PM] Markus#5464
they might pay u the minimum required to survive but everyone got different needs so wont work

yea all focus on btc for now, but when btc is buzzing ppl will get excited about alts again most likely

[04-Aug-19 04:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
although alts without a purpose will get culled once crypto is more than a specualtion space

[04-Aug-19 04:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
haha

[04-Aug-19 04:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll take half whatever your job is, will you share it ?

[04-Aug-19 04:34 PM] nocturnal#2177

100% of nothing is still nothing.... but if its free then whats the problem?

[04-Aug-19 04:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The issue we face now with altprices is due to 99.99% of people just wanting to make more fiat

[04-Aug-19 04:52 PM] p.#1126
thats it

[04-Aug-19 04:52 PM] p.#1126
BTC, FIAT

[04-Aug-19 04:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

When btc peaks it will be sold just like everything else for fiat.

[04-Aug-19 04:54 PM] p.#1126
isnt that better than just sold and no peak :troll_lol:

[04-Aug-19 04:57 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why not ?? @polycryptoblog imagine the hassle buying a coffee with 0.000001 btc , which then the money isn't even stable for the coffeshop owner

[04-Aug-19 04:58 PM] p.#1126
seems like a great deal for the store owner

[04-Aug-19 04:58 PM] p.#1126
IMO

[04-Aug-19 04:58 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Or else , btc becomes world currency. Everybody hodls. Economies collapses

[04-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Markus#5464
fiat is not stable either

[04-Aug-19 04:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Stability is relative

[04-Aug-19 04:59 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I mean it doesn't change 10 % in a day because a whale decides it's pump time

[04-Aug-19 05:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@blackjok3r  while you are here, I have been wanting to ask you,  I remember you were tinkering around with changes to tokencc .   Is that still in the cards and/or is there any compatibility issue with tokens created with how it is currently?

[04-Aug-19 05:01 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
+ I don't know how many exactly own most of btc . But I estimate 1000 people . Lol that's even worse than what we have now with fiat 1%

[04-Aug-19 05:02 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Most of them lucky neets , former drug dealers or other misfits

[04-Aug-19 05:02 PM] Markus#5464
fiat u can print non stop btc  u cant

[04-Aug-19 05:02 PM] Markus#5464
