Ethereum looks good

[20-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Hegelian#0018
First time ethereum went to $300 Bitcoin was $2,500. Now Bitcoin is $9,300 and ethereum is under $300

[20-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Tek#5253
ethereum has no real reason to moon tho

[20-Jun-19 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep it has. it's corporate coin, hail corporate coin 😄

[20-Jun-19 03:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[20-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Tek#5253
xmr is gonna make moves I think

[20-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Tek#5253
a month ago the inflation dropped below that of bitcoin's

[20-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Tek#5253
it hasn't really gone down for a month either

[20-Jun-19 03:02 PM] Tek#5253
xmr has been stable against btc for the last 7 weeks

[20-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Hegelian#0018
Ethereum will be on bakkt and etrade and people there will prefer cheap etheruem to expensive bitcoin

[20-Jun-19 03:45 PM] Hegelian#0018
And when it goes pos it will have a yield which makes it even more of a no brainer for traditional investor

[20-Jun-19 05:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
1 more year until eth goes pos?

[20-Jun-19 05:22 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902
Even if BTC does turn bear you’ll make money on ETH if you HODL for a little while

[20-Jun-19 07:03 PM] yorklab#7270
I never thought the KMD Satoshi value would get this low again, especially so close to the big launch. The hack and BTC going up created a double whammy.
