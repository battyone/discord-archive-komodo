dont jump to conclusions

[09-Aug-19 04:43 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just yet

[09-Aug-19 04:44 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's not scam, but a lot of people were not happy with communications and went in full meltdown mode

[09-Aug-19 04:44 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
no conclusion...only a question because i see there was a lot of fud against k64

[09-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
what happened with communication?

[09-Aug-19 04:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
people wanted to know the big funding partner and have official confirm, they sorta announced the name unnofficially but a joint press release can only come next week. Some parts still under nda. So it's a fudding festival

[09-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
basically what he said.

[09-Aug-19 04:47 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I noticed some folks reading things in messages that weren’t said.. stirring things up.

[09-Aug-19 04:49 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
But also some valid statements were made about blockchain implementation. But like every development, that will take time

[09-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Neko#5830
just fud

[09-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Neko#5830
why people dont wait

[09-Aug-19 04:57 PM] Buddz1993#5380
people are reckless.

[09-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
thus price equals 350 sats now lol

[09-Aug-19 04:58 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just based on fud 😃

[09-Aug-19 05:00 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
ok and who is the partner?

[09-Aug-19 05:00 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Goldman Sachs

[09-Aug-19 05:00 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
oh what

[09-Aug-19 05:00 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
really?

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
that would be nice

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Neko#5830
i don't know but woudnt be surprised, komodo is what big tech thought ethereum was

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
but problem is that there is no  confirmation of goldman sachs

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
?

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Markus#5464
@Neko  K64 is not KMD

[09-Aug-19 05:01 PM] Neko#5830
I know

[09-Aug-19 05:02 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That was part of the FUD... people don’t believe that because <insert favorite bullshit reason here>

👆 

[09-Aug-19 05:02 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
ok understand...but will there be an official announcement of goldman sachs?

[09-Aug-19 05:02 PM] Markus#5464
Everyone should stick to the golden rule in crypto, never believe anything before it actually happens and that its possible to verify

[09-Aug-19 05:02 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
what k64 say to that?

[09-Aug-19 05:02 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Somewhere next week, iirc

[09-Aug-19 05:03 PM] Neko#5830
@Markus its built on top

[09-Aug-19 05:03 PM] Markus#5464
Well not rly, they want to integrate blockchain transactions in their unity games

[09-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
so i dont understand teh problem...if goldman sachs is the partner and can confirm that in next week than its very good for komodo ecosystem

[09-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Neko#5830
@Markus using komodo

[09-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Markus#5464
I have alot of things to say about K64 but i wont, in the end its my own opinions dont want to increasse the fud but to me they did not handle things very professionaly

[09-Aug-19 05:06 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
tell me in pm

[09-Aug-19 05:07 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Markus: things could have been handled better IMO.

[09-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Markus#5464
They basically did opposite what kmd does

[09-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
but km and k64 are not the same company?

[09-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Markus#5464
no

[09-Aug-19 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is not a company

[09-Aug-19 05:08 PM] dukeleto#7326

[09-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Stephen Hawking#3934
i mean...people from k64 are kmd people too or not?

[09-Aug-19 05:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
no theyt totally different thing

[09-Aug-19 05:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
k64 uses kmd tech for their thing

[09-Aug-19 05:09 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
that's it

[09-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Tek#5253

[09-Aug-19 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek bug, not a feature

[09-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Markus#5464
great then we can probably have little more dumping when ppl come here and read all the negativity going on here

[09-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464
I withdrew funds from every exchange, about to take a break from crypto for a while and not trade it again until its showing a better side, until then its time  to get away from all negativity going on here

[09-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Neko#5830
yup

[09-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Markus#5464
Actually gonna use this time to educate myself more in how technical things in crypto work, i think its good to know how things work more in depth

[09-Aug-19 05:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
komodo chat is a bit rougher than most, that is for sure

[09-Aug-19 05:30 PM] JimD#9272
KMD has one of the best platforms out there but never gets any respect

[09-Aug-19 05:30 PM] JimD#9272
meanwhile tons of shitcoins run wild

[09-Aug-19 05:31 PM] JimD#9272
its a little disheartening

[09-Aug-19 05:31 PM] JimD#9272

[09-Aug-19 05:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Still waiting for it tek

[09-Aug-19 05:35 PM] allbits#5898
@Markus have you tried cli wallets in Linux yet. That's a good place to start.

[09-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
for what

[09-Aug-19 05:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
These copies everyone says is happening

[09-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Markus#5464
@allbits i use Windows, i have 0 experience with other OS

[09-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253

[09-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
U can install linux on a VM right?

[09-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
If so might try it

[09-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Neko#5830
virtualbox yeah

auto-liquidation of ZEC might actually be the best investment for their clients

[09-Aug-19 05:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
Coinbase dropping ZEC for UK customers, anybody heard about this?

[09-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Slyris#2880
Omg

[09-Aug-19 05:46 PM] dan.#2473
if i had to guess, its because of regulatory pressure and z tx

[09-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Slyris#2880
Wtf

[09-Aug-19 05:46 PM] Slyris#2880
It's smell bad for kmd too

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] allbits#5898
@Markus if you need any help walking through cli setup let me know. I'm a noob but have done kmd, vrsc, pirate, atomicDEX-API. Even spun up my own blockchain. All very fun.

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
kmd dont have z tx

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm dreaming of a listing of KMD in coinbase since my childhood

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Slyris#2880
I hope one day we will get it

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@dan. nobody uses zaddrs on ZEC, that can't be it

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] dan.#2473
good point, maybe its more of a matter of "they could" though

[09-Aug-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
@allbits thanks mate will remember 😃

[09-Aug-19 05:49 PM] dan.#2473
i dont know what else it could be

[09-Aug-19 05:53 PM] LocoMB#8593
I hope this doesn't get as boring as Mr.Robot Season3 ...
well, tbh, I stoppped watching toward the end of season 2, because it was abouit as exciting as watching paint dry... does anyone know if season3 gets any more .. lively or so?

[09-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
season 1 was so bad

[09-Aug-19 05:55 PM] LocoMB#8593
.. borderline..  season 2 was much worse I think- the only interesting thing was that eCoin scene with Libra prediction

[09-Aug-19 06:00 PM] LocoMB#8593
meh/ I'll go watch some History drama - medieval stuff ⚔ 
(maybe if i don't pay attention, altcoin season will do a sneak lauch)
