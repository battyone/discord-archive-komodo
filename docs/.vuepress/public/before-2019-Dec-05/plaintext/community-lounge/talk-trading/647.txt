`btw if bit hits 8390 the next level is 10k`
Just be prepared for the crash when the parabolic bubble bursts 😉

[14-May-19 01:14 PM] kaks#6612
the correction cant be 40% LOL

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it might crash to $6200, which is still double bear market low

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the last one dropped to 18%

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] kaks#6612
yh and pumped again

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] kaks#6612
retest the resistance level

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
82% loss only happens across the duration of a long bear

[14-May-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not during a correction in a bull

[14-May-19 01:16 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Last time it went parabolic btc was supposed to correct at 10k but it kept going... If I remember correctly.

[14-May-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
how many plates in a china shop does a charging bull break

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
combining the newness of the space and so many parabolic in such a short time means that the smart investor needs to be prepare for anything to be possible, imo

💯 

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the charging bull isnt counting the number of plates he is breaking to pace himself

[14-May-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
he does whatever he wants

we can only watch

[14-May-19 01:18 PM] kaks#6612
imo btc cant go above than 61% dominance

[14-May-19 01:18 PM] kaks#6612
or altcoins will die

[14-May-19 01:19 PM] kaks#6612
imo

[14-May-19 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) BTC is an altcoin
2) 90% of coins could die and no one would even notice in the "real world"

I have a feeling this is no longer a whales game, stock market crashing and bitcoin mooning....hmm

[14-May-19 01:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will know when binance opens

[14-May-19 01:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I can think that a dump from btc to alts will happen

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Chinese/US trade war anyone?

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] Markus#5464
maybe rothschild family buying bitcoin in silence?

[14-May-19 01:22 PM] Markus#5464
to find safety when their banks plummet?

[14-May-19 01:23 PM] Sherdogz#6731

russia in general is a big bitcoin player in the game tho but about putin i doubt

[14-May-19 01:24 PM] kaks#6612

8725 ish

[14-May-19 01:28 PM] kaks#6612
yh first have to break 8390

[14-May-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no magic BTC dominance number

[14-May-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it used to be 90%, yet altcoins survived

[14-May-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if 1% of wealth is moving into BTC, how much will that change the price?

[14-May-19 01:30 PM] Markus#5464
shitloads

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
its hard to say how much price would be cause 100 mil usd rallied price by 25% or so

[14-May-19 01:32 PM] Markus#5464
1 billion could probably swing up price twice if not more

[14-May-19 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
so binance is just making everybody wait?

[14-May-19 03:11 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Only question is when 😄

[14-May-19 03:11 PM] kaks#6612
50 min to know if pump or dump

[14-May-19 03:13 PM] Malti#3948

GBP and EUR trading

[14-May-19 03:22 PM] Malti#3948
I just think that the majority of people have accounts on multiple exchanges

[14-May-19 03:23 PM] Malti#3948
so I think I underestimate the binance effect

[14-May-19 03:24 PM] Malti#3948
@siu - Chainmakers do you also TA other coins than BTC and KMD?

[14-May-19 03:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Replace “my computer” with “my portfolio”

[14-May-19 04:02 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So the catalyst for the next superbull run has nothing to do with adoption but has to do with noob mistake 😄
