11btc at 22.5 are being eaten

[17-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Markus#5464
barely no sell orders up to 23k

[17-Apr-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
seems its mostly bot orders that pushed it down from 28k

[17-Apr-19 03:04 PM] sφldat#8733
why do you think that jl?

[17-Apr-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
there is about 10 btc worth on both sides of the orderbook, nothing very deep on binance

[17-Apr-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and the same 10 btc is recycled on buy side, sell side

[17-Apr-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the bots are putting the buy slightly lower and the sell slighlty lower hour by hour, day by day

[17-Apr-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
we get the dropping of the price

[17-Apr-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and that allows the big buys after it drops 30% for "no reason"

[17-Apr-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and then it goes up 20% for "no reason"

Actually, it makes sense

[17-Apr-19 03:11 PM] Keppie#5156
While I agree on bots driving the price down, i disagree with the fact that there is only 10 btc worth buy/sell. Binance does not show you the full orderbook

[17-Apr-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
alot of bots might also trigger on certain prices

[17-Apr-19 03:12 PM] Markus#5464
before they place a order

[17-Apr-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then how can a 40 BTC buy move things 15% in a blink

[17-Apr-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the price is going sideways, so the bots setup shop around 2275. it seems unlikely for the price to be so stable after such a fast rise almost 15%

[17-Apr-19 03:28 PM] Alexfrog#1338
komodo price:  15% less disgustingly low than yesterday. 😄

[17-Apr-19 03:28 PM] dokrates#8987
@jl777c honestly after this last pump, the volume is sooo dry

[17-Apr-19 03:28 PM] dokrates#8987
in fact i think each attempt to buy from whales, will rise the price harder

[17-Apr-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
unless more buyside comes in, then the bots will gradually push the price down so they can restock inventory at 30% discount

[17-Apr-19 03:28 PM] dokrates#8987
because the accumulation is insane right now

[17-Apr-19 03:29 PM] Tek#5253
m not going to try and trade this

[17-Apr-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
volume is triple

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what i mean by bots pushing the price down. it is on low volume

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] Alexfrog#1338
where the hell was this for the past week

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
when it is high volume the bots dont have the power to move the price

[17-Apr-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
now why would the marketmaker bots want to push the price down?

[17-Apr-19 03:31 PM] Alecandro#1179
so they push the price down to entice the big buyers to bring volume back?

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] dokrates#8987
it's the way they accumulate

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] gcharang#6833
> so they push the price down to trigger stop losses, and attract panic sellers to stock up the coin at  a discount

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if your business was buying and selling potatoes, how much do you want to pay for potatoes

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
more or less

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Malti#3948
i'd like to pay less, but sell at more

[17-Apr-19 03:32 PM] Malti#3948
and one of these bots have to sell at one point no?

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Malti#3948
so when do they sell?

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Malti#3948
now?

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
when the marketmaker is in accumulate mode it pushes the price down

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
when it goes into divest mode, that is when the default is to push the price up

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Alecandro#1179
yea that makes perfect sense

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont get fooled by it and certainly dont get emotional over it

[17-Apr-19 03:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is what it is

[17-Apr-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if you could code a price pushing bot to give you lower prices, you probably would too

[17-Apr-19 03:34 PM] Alecandro#1179
hell yea lol

[17-Apr-19 03:37 PM] dokrates#8987
@jl777c you never tried to do a bot of this kind?

[17-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Markus#5464
he probably could if he wanted

[17-Apr-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I could, but havent

[17-Apr-19 03:42 PM] Alecandro#1179
I'm also inclined to agree with your hypothesis @jl777c because even during the past few weeks dropping from 38k sats to 19k sats, the OBV barely moved - making it seem like no one is really selling

[17-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Malti#3948
if priceislow, then buy
else, sell

[17-Apr-19 03:43 PM] Malti#3948

On-Balance Volume (OBV)
On-balance volume (OBV) is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.

[17-Apr-19 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so this pretty much proves my hypothesis. on balance the volume goes down a few percent, price drops 50%

[17-Apr-19 03:45 PM] Markus#5464
lets see if we can get above 23k and stay there then we got free way to 28k no resistances rly between

[17-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but really the spike to 38k was from the arb to the coinbene fat finger

[17-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
still a 30k drop to 20k on no bad news, is the marketmaker bots creating cheap inventory

[17-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they are whalebros bots

[17-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
possible 😄

[17-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
atleast he got inventory to do so

[17-Apr-19 03:46 PM] Alecandro#1179
perhaps, that would make sense honestly

[17-Apr-19 03:47 PM] Alecandro#1179
For a whale with that much KMD, moving the price down from 30 to 20 would provide for immense opportunity to accumulate more KMD

😮 💯 

[17-Apr-19 03:48 PM] Alecandro#1179
The other thing is that we almost perfectly bounced off the 200MA twice in the last 4-5 days

[17-Apr-19 03:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
seriously

[17-Apr-19 03:50 PM] jl777c#5810
assumes he was able to accumulate a few hundred BTC worth and get 30% to 50% gain each cycle
