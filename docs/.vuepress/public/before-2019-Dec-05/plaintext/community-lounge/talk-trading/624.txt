all the so-called DEX that are centralized I think will be in some troubles

[09-May-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what a dapp has to do in order to be considered a money transmitting dapp

[09-May-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if you just send funds p2p, it is ok

[09-May-19 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if I sell assets P2P I'm transmitter like euro2asset?

[09-May-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if you send it to a dapp that locks it and later you can unlock it, it seems no money was transmitted to any third party as it was locked and not really in money form until unlocked again

[09-May-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
they say a bitcoin ATM is a money transmitter

[09-May-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
non-custodial wallet is not

[09-May-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a bit contradictory and cant deduce what actual logic they are using

[09-May-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
most all the ETH smartcontracts are centralized

[09-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
whoever is managing it can update it, fund it, stop it, etc.

[09-May-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so i think they assumed that all dapps are like that?

[09-May-19 08:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
`so it is a bit contradictory and cant deduce what actual logic they are using` that's assuming they are using one

[09-May-19 08:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So agama is liable too?

[09-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810

`is this even news? same situation since 2011`

[09-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
how would agama be liable?

[09-May-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
is there somebody that controls all the funds in agama wallets? ie. custodial

Its a dapp, transfer funds, :troll_hurt:

[09-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
coinbase is a money transmitter

[09-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
normal wallets are not

[09-May-19 08:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
üòÇ

[09-May-19 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the logic they used is enforceability

[09-May-19 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
they know they can regulate the coinbases, and know they cant regulate all the normal wallets

[09-May-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but the dapp regulation is quite strange... clearly they cant regulate something built into the blockchain

[09-May-19 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe komodo CC with built in contracts is the only way around this dapp regulation. but this is all guessworks

[09-May-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the fuzziest part is when does a dapp become guilty of transmitting money

[09-May-19 08:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if you send money into a black box and it comes back to you, was any money transmitted?

`presumably development will continue outside China and North Korea...`

[09-May-19 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But then again, are you transmitting money, an asset, a security, a token...

[09-May-19 08:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
we don't know ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 1 euro is 1 euro

We ain't superior we are community for freedom

[09-May-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems logical that a money transmission needs to have 3 people involved. with the money transmitter in the middle. so maybe the money transmitting dapp are the trading dapps with the dapp being the one in the middle? but that is a DEX that is blockchain enforced so it is exempted

[09-May-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
very confusing

[09-May-19 08:29 PM] jl777c#5810
glad that barterDEX is 100% in the clear though!
