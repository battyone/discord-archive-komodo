Bitmex: “what is that, halibut?”

Can someone please ask CZ to add kmdusdt pair? Please...

[01-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
cz doesn’t listen

[01-Jun-19 03:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Someone will listen

[01-Jun-19 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Binance usdt pair is what is needed first of all if kmd wants to get to top 25 coins

[01-Jun-19 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
TUSD, USDC USDT, DAI

[01-Jun-19 03:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
all those stable tokens

Hi @cz_binance 

I’ve been asked to ask you to add a KMD/USDT pair to binance.

Also, @PirateChain applied to have $arrr listed with you guys.  Are z-transactions something your team has the ability to integrate?  

Cheers!

Cz is digging IEO for now

[01-Jun-19 03:54 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The ieos come with usd pairs included

Those IEO work only for binance

[01-Jun-19 03:58 PM] 차미숙#8912
No other platform can replicate it

[01-Jun-19 03:58 PM] 차미숙#8912
Maybe bitfinex and upbit

[01-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

You need a native exchange coin and lots of users + IEO

On the side though, i don't think the derivative will do much

[01-Jun-19 04:03 PM] 차미숙#8912
Margins are not that much compared to the volume and market cap of the coins

They probably need another entity if they really wanna do dex

[01-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
Im wondering if KomoDEX will potentially have issues with SEC later on like EtherDelta

[01-Jun-19 04:54 PM] Markus#5464
i mean they cant shut it down but they can get it delisted from app stores

[01-Jun-19 04:55 PM] 차미숙#8912
James was anonymous from the very start because of these issues

[01-Jun-19 04:55 PM] 차미숙#8912
Well let's get there first

[01-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Markus#5464
Well JL being anonymous is one thing but KMD's other leaders do have publicly known identities

[01-Jun-19 04:55 PM] 차미숙#8912
The protocol is extremely decentralized

[01-Jun-19 04:56 PM] 차미숙#8912
Other devs are more like UI things

[01-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Markus#5464
not talking about devs but even CEO of kmd

[01-Jun-19 04:59 PM] p.#1126
usdt pair would be nice at same time as rebrand

[01-Jun-19 04:59 PM] p.#1126
could be nice catalyst

[01-Jun-19 05:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
I think if kmd dex got so big that sec started looking into it, the pool of decentralized devs and apps around it would be hard to pinpoint

[01-Jun-19 05:00 PM] 차미숙#8912
Government usually pinpoints the head

Oh i see

[01-Jun-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
very specific languages. we can even have a website that displays orderbook info. the reason is that it is non-custodial (and there is no way to stop it so they avoid being silly)

[01-Jun-19 05:02 PM] 차미숙#8912
Well if it becomes a problem in their sphere of concerns, who knows

[01-Jun-19 05:02 PM] 차미숙#8912
A true dex gotta be like bitcoin eventually

[01-Jun-19 05:02 PM] 차미숙#8912
Hard to pinpoint exactly who

Maybe add it to barterdex?

[01-Jun-19 05:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@PTYX  Is it normal when I open the wallet and dont ask me for a pin or the touch ID?

[02-Jun-19 12:23 AM] PTYX#6840
@modereck In Chameleon the password will be asked when you make a transaction

[02-Jun-19 12:24 AM] PTYX#6840
We were thinking of adding multi-account access with pin protection prior to seeing balance.

[02-Jun-19 01:05 AM] modereck#4269
ok, yes that would be great

[02-Jun-19 01:06 AM] modereck#4269
if someone steal your phone they can see how much cryptos do you have
