[16-Jul-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
with all the talk about the logo i am surprised there is no debate about the font

[16-Jul-19 07:14 PM] jl777c#5810
after all, it seems those are the most relevant things for a project like komodo

[16-Jul-19 07:14 PM] Caglio#3337

@meatspoon thank you sir

[16-Jul-19 07:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
KMD could be a bald guy eating dinner with corpses hanging in background.  I like it.

[16-Jul-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810

[16-Jul-19 07:19 PM] meatspoon#7860

will you forget the logo?

[16-Jul-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it makes a strong impression and very hard to forget

[16-Jul-19 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it is also unique among cryptocoins, which is what matters

[16-Jul-19 07:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Adidas logo would also be unique among the crypto

[16-Jul-19 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
did you even look at the website content and documentation? or is your "analysis" of the rebrand limited to the logo?
