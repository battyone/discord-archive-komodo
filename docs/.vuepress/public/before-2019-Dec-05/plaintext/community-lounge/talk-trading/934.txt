I think the logo is amazing, really anything different will be met with disapproval at first as psychologically people dont accept change very well, in time probably it will be viewed in a more positive light.

The logo looks like a little amoeba or some kind of cell structure, generating from its nucleus or core a copy of itself. 

I think if considered from a tech standpoint or philosophically it is an adequate or fitting symbol, like spawning chains from the mainchain, generating clones from the original.

Finally a true and good breakdown of the new logo. @digital bullion üíØ

[16-Jul-19 05:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Beside particl logo it really shines in my taskbar

[16-Jul-19 05:00 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
And stands out

[16-Jul-19 05:01 AM] Malti#3948
The rebrand is also more than a new logo and website. Yes it‚Äôs the most noticeable right now, but the way kmd is headed with this new communication strategy will be way more important

[16-Jul-19 05:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
protip: dont let yourself be the worst performing coin in the top 100 on the day you rebrand

[16-Jul-19 05:02 AM] Malti#3948
Rebrand is focused on adoption. Not coin holders

[16-Jul-19 05:02 AM] Caglio#3337
@Alexfrog protip 2, dont steal logo from other companies

[16-Jul-19 05:03 AM] Malti#3948
I wonder what the biggest achievements of the biggest critics in this group are tbh

[16-Jul-19 05:04 AM] Caglio#3337
@Malti you mean real life?

[16-Jul-19 05:04 AM] Malti#3948
Yes

[16-Jul-19 05:04 AM] Alexfrog#1338
complaining in KMD discord is definitely our largest achievement! üòÑ

[16-Jul-19 05:05 AM] Malti#3948

I was awarded a PhD in komodo discord complaining from my local university.

[16-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Malti#3948
Imagine working on this for a full year. Working and reworking every sentence of a website within a larger communication scheme. Just to see that your logo is being bashed by some people in a discord that are silent whenever a community marketing campaign is being proposed.

[16-Jul-19 05:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Got it ... Judy Dench

[16-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Caglio#3337

[16-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Caglio#3337

they could use bitconnect's logo and it wont matter as long as the mobiledex works as intended

[16-Jul-19 05:22 AM] Caglio#3337
what if noone uses it ?

[16-Jul-19 05:22 AM] Caglio#3337
what if ppl dont recognize the groundbreaking tech

[16-Jul-19 05:24 AM] joe2x4#5987
Caglio you are a chucklehead go back to your crack rock. The logo looks great, congrats marketing team.

[16-Jul-19 05:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
if the govt's of the g20 decide to scrap their plan to crush exchanges i would be concerned about usage.

with things as they are i dont think adoption will be an issue

[16-Jul-19 05:25 AM] Caglio#3337
@actionslacks i hope so

[16-Jul-19 05:30 AM] joe2x4#5987
Bitching about logo = lame. This past weekend I went camping with a group, drank a shitload of mushroom tea, then helped kill a rattlesnake in the middle of night that got too close to camp. The rattlesnake meat was then cooked over the fire. Trust me, I'm not going to lose sleep over the new logo.

[16-Jul-19 05:33 AM] Malti#3948
Bitching without own measurable action = lame

[16-Jul-19 05:34 AM] Caglio#3337
@joe2x4 Im not bitching, I am just laughing at this absurd. I would really like to meet person that "invented" this logo. I have a different view on things than most of you, I would feel really offended if someone pulled such a trick with me, some people here obviously dont have problems with it, thats why I question your sanity

[16-Jul-19 05:35 AM] Caglio#3337
So without doing job that they were paid for, they take other ppl logo? Imagine what could we accomplish with someone that would actually do their job

[16-Jul-19 05:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Fantastic marketing moves, I actually get more info about kmd by users of this discord over twitter, than this fucking joke marketing company

[16-Jul-19 05:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
it is what it is, the rebrand is done. time to move on with life. i'm not in love with it either. but change is what was demanded, and change was delivered.

[16-Jul-19 05:39 AM] ryman112#0068
@Malti nobody is bitching we are laughing.  This is a comical logo no less no more

I have no programming skills, and have never worked with the creation of blockchains. But just in 5 minutes I generated my chain using GUI.  This is the success of KMD. Easier than ordering goods in Ebay.   I applaud standing.

@altcoinist if you dont want to use the builder and use your own hosting etc you can do it for free

[16-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But you need to be able to use cli etc

[16-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be the better option if doing it for the lulz and you are a bit tech savvy

And will all money from customers convert to kmd?

[16-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That I do not know, at least part of it will be used to pay for notarization services etc, in which case it will go into CRYPTO, which needs to convert into kmd to payout dividends üòÉ

[16-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Regarding other services not sure

[16-Jul-19 09:55 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wow that is cool

[16-Jul-19 10:20 AM] Markus#5464
seems like this is possibility for kmd to get some cash flow, hopefully it will be used to spread the word to bring adoption
