[slack] <CrypToon> ðŸ˜ƒ

[15-Jun-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Tbh, regarding the btc/bch discussions itâ€™s sad that things are getting so polarized around a couple of notable persons

[15-Jun-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Which actually make it hard for a technical discussion about the flaws/solutions both coins offer

[15-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> Yea, personal attacks get both nowhere. You honestly just have to step back and see what they are both doing and who is actually being successful. Who has the backing of the vendors; who is forcing vendors away... which is honestly what truly matters

[15-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Both have their merits, but all the drama surrounding it isnâ€™t helping anyone, especially not the industry as a whole

[15-Jun-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> True, I sincerely believe one will die in the next decade though, because the maximalist will come to consensus and pull their support from one of them for their "hyperbitcoinization"

[15-Jun-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> If one dies it will probably be because one or the other isnt being used enough thus doesnt really hold value

[15-Jun-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Like 95% of coins today

[15-Jun-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> But I can see btc being used for store of value and bch for payments etc

[15-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> Yup as that starts to pan out the companies will deprecate it from their platform and accelerate it's demise.

[15-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> True

[15-Jun-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> http://blockchain.com has already stated it will be deprecating support in the future. Bitpay will most likely tie up loose ends over the next 3-5 years in preparation.

[15-Jun-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing in nature that says there can only be one when there are sufficient resources to support multiple species. most likely scenario is that both live on for a long time (DOS and Windows still here) and it is not like crypto has many effective predators that eat them. Whoever owns the crypto becomes self-interest motivated to keep it going

[15-Jun-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
all this talk about one crypto ruling them all is just silly talk. even super centralized things like fiat currencies end up with hundreds of variants. and that requires a nationstate to create one, most all have. What does it take to create a crypto? much less than a nationstate, so you can be assured there will be a a lot of hard to kill cryptos created

[15-Jun-18 07:06 AM] aFastHero#2811
The way I understand economics, competing currencies would be most beneficial.

[15-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Maeler> The maximalist will do their best to kill the opposing chain. When I think of maximalist I think of big bitcoin companies who've flourished for years now and refuse to add other cryptos i.e. ethereum/litecoin. Which I think honestly should have been added by now.

[15-Jun-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
even BTC that was the only secure coin for a long time just needed a few years of misguided "development" to open the way for competitive coins like ETH, etc. If BTC itself cant maintain the dominance in the past, it certainly wont in the future

[15-Jun-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will likely stay the #1 marketshare crypto for quite a quite a while, think DOS and how long that was #1

[15-Jun-18 07:09 AM] BlackJesus#6161
True, but crypto moves lightning fast. Honestly a year in this space feels like 5-10 in other spaces.

<Maeler

[15-Jun-18 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to  me the talk and claims in crypto moves fast, but really how much is actually working?

[15-Jun-18 07:11 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It feels like the world in general is speeding up. Computers took what 30-20years, Internet took 20, Cellphones took 10

[15-Jun-18 07:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
II'd pace crypto with the internet.

[15-Jun-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and we are almost halfway done

[15-Jun-18 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
once people see the working KMD solutions, the pace will accelerate. the gap between the talk and reality is usually quite large, so that is why we concentrate on getting things actually working

[15-Jun-18 07:13 AM] BlackJesus#6161
It'll only take 1  G7 country to convert to crypto and the rest will follow suit in an effort to not be left behind.

[15-Jun-18 07:13 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea, I think komodo has about 3-5 years left before that happens, well atleast I hope so lol.

[15-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Thatâ€™s why kmd is working hard on the scaling solutions

[15-Jun-18 07:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
To not get left behind

[15-Jun-18 07:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As it will be the way forward

[15-Jun-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it takes that long, but I think a bit faster and it wont start with a G7 country, but a small "insignificant" one, but after they do, they will get a crazy boost from the crypto flowing through it

[15-Jun-18 07:15 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Komodo is way ahead of the curve. I feel like what Jl777 said. Komodo is outpacing education.

[15-Jun-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and other countries follow. with the world polarizing into pro and anti crypto nations, it will be a bit like the east vs west during communism. the west was simply more productive due to the incentives and as imperfect as capitalism is, it was better than the communism

[15-Jun-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I wonder if and when we'll ever see RAMChains back in use in our tech.

[15-Jun-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I missed those days.

[15-Jun-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the time to educate is after wehave a complete solution

[15-Jun-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
segwit made RAMchains impractical

[15-Jun-18 07:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Just like capitalism vs. communism crypto will win due to borderlessness of it. Countries will be more connected than ever before.

[15-Jun-18 07:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... yeah

[15-Jun-18 07:17 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Nationalism has to die.

[15-Jun-18 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
countries that charge 80% taxes vs countries that charge 10% to 20%. sound familiar?

[15-Jun-18 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt take a nobel prize winning economist to predict what countries will outperform and where the smart people end up

[15-Jun-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sounds like 4 regions on earth ðŸ˜„

[15-Jun-18 07:20 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Brain drain it's real and something that inevitably happens when you attempt to dumb the population by attacking the intellectuals.

[15-Jun-18 07:21 AM] BlackJesus#6161
"Fake News"

[15-Jun-18 07:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
"Alternative Facts"

[15-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
or simply taking majority from people who are not smart enough to move, it seems many people are brainwashed to believe only their country is civilized. And while there are some not so nice places to live on earth, that is really the exception as there are many really nice places to live where they dont start by taking half of what you have before taking the other half

[15-Jun-18 07:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[15-Jun-18 07:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
True, here in America there are countless people who've never left the country and they always say. "I have no desire when there's so much to do here". It's such a small mentality it bewilders me how you can know of all these other places where not only the accent changes but the entire culture and have no desire at all to see it or experience it.

[15-Jun-18 07:26 AM] BlackJesus#6161
They've formed concrete opinions based on secondhand knowledge...

[15-Jun-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if they dont mind being like slaves, then that is their choice, but the most productive people tend to not like being treated like slaves
