if you haven't made positive gains on KMD at any time in the last 2 years, then your margins are too close or your vision is, I don't know which

_holds just enough outside of this ecosystem to perpetuate what he does inside it and a tiny BTC "nest egg"_

only 7,6% of votes cast so far

the hodlgame is strong in VOTE2019

[25-Apr-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
I figure more votes will be cast on the final day than any other

[25-Apr-19 12:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
I agree and some will be wasted because they are late by a few minutes

[25-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what is the vote snapshot time/blockheight?

[25-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many coins are sitting on exchanges?

[25-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last year about 40% voted, in theory more should vote this year?

[25-Apr-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i would think less due to bear market exhaustion

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many ‚Äúexpired‚Äù utxo‚Äôs are there for interest?

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably give a good indication of participation

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Show how many checked out during bear

[25-Apr-19 01:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
>>what is the vote snapshot time/blockheight?
It's either one block before ON or after 14 May 00.00 UTC but afaik this has not been communicated yet.
The snapshot for the airdrop was the one closest to 00.00 UTC ( which was before 00:00) maybe it's the same logic for the cut of point... kolo is the election master

[25-Apr-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810

if you can time it exactly, you can make a bit of incremental returns by selling at 20k, buyback at 19k

[25-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
