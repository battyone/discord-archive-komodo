[13-Mar-19 04:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[13-Mar-19 04:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
now there's probably  a lot more people with their kmd on exchanges. be a good time to mention the 5% rewards on twitter and get some more wallets out there

[13-Mar-19 04:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
whoever dumped pirate for kmd on digitalprice will be sad lol

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Markus#5464
if we retrace to 27k or so....that would be really nice 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
id be fine with 27k

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
not sure it will get that though

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Alexfrog#1338
my order is in in the 23s

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
even 25k is okay lol

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Alexfrog#1338
gonna calculate how many free KMD ill be getting from that 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Alecandro#1179
yea good idea mna

[13-Mar-19 04:35 AM] Markus#5464
i sadly missed out on some profits due to long confirmation time

[13-Mar-19 04:35 AM] Markus#5464
that rly sux 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:36 AM] Alecandro#1179
yea 120 confs is ridiculous

[13-Mar-19 04:36 AM] Markus#5464
took over 2 hour to get it deposited

[13-Mar-19 04:36 AM] Markus#5464
i literally deposited right when i saw it starting to rally

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Alecandro#1179
its like they want you to store on exchanges for easy access lol

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Alecandro#1179
woahhhh

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
31k on huobi now

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
hehe

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
probably 25k in a couple of hours

[13-Mar-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
last time huobi fucked us

[13-Mar-19 04:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
huobi under binance lol

[13-Mar-19 04:42 AM] Alecandro#1179
@Alexfrog you think we have one more dead cat bounce before we drop back down to the mid 20's?

[13-Mar-19 04:42 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no idea 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:43 AM] Funkyball#2786
31k is the decider

[13-Mar-19 04:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
we are at the short term moving average on the 30 min, so if it happens it could be here

[13-Mar-19 04:43 AM] Markus#5464
think we will see a selloff when ppl from europe wake up

[13-Mar-19 04:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if it bounces a lot, sell more to buy in the 20s

[13-Mar-19 04:44 AM] Alexfrog#1338
probably

[13-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Markus#5464
look at the volume tho

[13-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Markus#5464
7660 btc on CMC

[13-Mar-19 04:50 AM] Alecandro#1179
lordy that's a lot of kmd

[13-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338
nope, down

[13-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Markus#5464
under 30k 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Funkyball#2786
down it is lol

[13-Mar-19 04:52 AM] Markus#5464
29k on huobi

[13-Mar-19 04:52 AM] dxer666#8963
19281 orders on bittrex always on

[13-Mar-19 04:53 AM] dxer666#8963
both side

[13-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
soon those people who bought the top will be selling back to us all in the low 20s lol

[13-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Markus#5464
i gladly take their stack at 23k 😄

[13-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Alecandro#1179
yup pretty much

[13-Mar-19 04:53 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so that they can go chase another stupid pump

[13-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Markus#5464
wish bittrex had better volume so we could trade more efficiently there

[13-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Markus#5464
😦

[13-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Markus#5464
anyone know if kmd trading app gonna have ledger integration?

[13-Mar-19 04:57 AM] Alecandro#1179
time for a little green now I think

[13-Mar-19 04:57 AM] Alecandro#1179
😃

[13-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Justchill#3485
This confirmation time must improve....

[13-Mar-19 04:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure huobi slowed it down during the pump

[13-Mar-19 04:59 AM] Justchill#3485
Liquidity is just part of the utility of a project

[13-Mar-19 05:00 AM] Sherdogz#6731
What happend😆

[13-Mar-19 05:01 AM] Markus#5464
it was obviously a bot pump from huobis side, similar to the fake volume during kmd contest to win 50k kmd

[13-Mar-19 05:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
Bittrex has even told me they couldn't accept the deposit when I was trying to do a big trade in the past

[13-Mar-19 05:02 AM] Justchill#3485
KMD is clearly one of the top 5 tokens in blockchains at the moment in regards to overall utility however users are fickle and confirm times will drive users away for the short term.  We want to keep volume high....

[13-Mar-19 05:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
this game is still rigged towards the exchanges

[13-Mar-19 05:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
exchanges' confirmation times are something the dev team has no control over @Justchill

[13-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Markus#5464
i hope kmd's trading app with mm 2.0 will become very active with alot of liquidity

[13-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Markus#5464
that would be a game changer

[13-Mar-19 05:04 AM] jspook16#3059
Kmd itself is a game changer

[13-Mar-19 05:04 AM] Markus#5464
ye ofc but we need a reliable exchange where u keep ur private keys safe, with good liquidity and without this forever waiting deposits

[13-Mar-19 05:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
it only takes 1 conf for amt's to show in the kmd wallet

[13-Mar-19 05:05 AM] jspook16#3059
There's the kmd app as well as the coincollect app both pursuing the same goal I think

[13-Mar-19 05:05 AM] Justchill#3485
Agreed, there are a number of decentralized exchanges, however, none see the volume needed to compete with exchange.  At this point Liquid (qash) looks the most promising

[13-Mar-19 05:06 AM] Justchill#3485
From a volume potential (Asia compliance)

[13-Mar-19 05:07 AM] jspook16#3059
CC is keeping volume in mind and plans to have a way to provide liquidity

[13-Mar-19 05:07 AM] jspook16#3059
We shall see how this plays out

[13-Mar-19 05:07 AM] jspook16#3059
2019 year of the 🐉

[13-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Justchill#3485
KMD obviously the most useful and widest options.  Atomic swaps and jumbler features will prove to be very useful on a go forward.

[13-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Markus#5464
o wow 28.7k on huobi

[13-Mar-19 05:09 AM] Justchill#3485
Hiding ones net worth (wallet value) is most valuable for pricing itegrity.  Only KMD allows this.

[13-Mar-19 05:10 AM] Justchill#3485
2951 on binance

[13-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
justchill, what do you mean about hiding wallet value

[13-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i would think only a good privacy coin like monero or pirate would do that

{Reactions}
💯 

[13-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Justchill#3485
Vollume dropping off

[13-Mar-19 05:11 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh snap kmd pamped? Damn.

[13-Mar-19 05:11 AM] jspook16#3059
Missed that wave. I like to buy high and sell low

[13-Mar-19 05:12 AM] Justchill#3485
Correct privacy option and jumbler.

[13-Mar-19 05:13 AM] Alexfrog#1338
kmd isnt a private coin anymore though

[13-Mar-19 05:14 AM] Justchill#3485
If a company or entity knows your net during any negotiation (transaction) they can taylor the value around your ability to pay a particular price.

[13-Mar-19 05:14 AM] Justchill#3485
This is a huge flaw in blockchains at the moment

[13-Mar-19 05:15 AM] jspook16#3059
Jumblr

[13-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Justchill#3485
My understanding is privacy will be an option moving forward.

[13-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Justchill#3485
As well as jumbler as an option
