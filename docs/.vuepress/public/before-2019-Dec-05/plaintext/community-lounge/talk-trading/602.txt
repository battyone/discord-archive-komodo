fwiw bitcoin had the same "issue" for a "few" years

[04-May-19 10:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes, those hodling 95% will sell, put coins in circulation and buy lambos.. so what?

[04-May-19 10:23 AM] Markus#5464
pretty greedy i would say, its my opinion, other ppl didnt get a fair chance cause there was no use for it and later on there is

[04-May-19 10:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
and how is that the hodlers fault?

[04-May-19 10:24 AM] Markus#5464
ofc its not

[04-May-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
but i mean its like someone creating a chain now and mining it for 5 years and then create a ultimate product out of it that will bring alot of hype, then only a few selected had the opportunity to get in early

[04-May-19 10:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
so what would u have them do? just give away their coins because the use case didn't have funds to dev N years ago?

[04-May-19 10:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
i think the idea was to do this when they created the chain (whoever that may be) and didn't have resources to do what was needed then and they have now

[04-May-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
I would have made the chain a test chain in first place and when the product is finished then launch the main net without supply from test net

[04-May-19 10:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
did they do an ico/ieo? genuinely asking as i don't know

[04-May-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
dont know

[04-May-19 10:29 AM] Markus#5464
so my whole point with that is if new ppl who dont know about Chips want to get in and find out that a few wallets hold almost whole supply it would definitely left a bad taste in their mouth, same goes to coins like XRP. I personally dont invest in XRP cause around 85% of supply is held by the team

[04-May-19 10:29 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Chips has been in development for years, it's not something new and there wasn't an ico. it was mined from the the start

[04-May-19 10:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
if people ignored it, it's only more good for those who noticed and holded for years

[04-May-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS was fairly launched 100% PoW

[04-May-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
comparing CHIPS to XRP is really quite unfair

[04-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET has about 10% of CHIPS via mining and the other 90% is held by other miners

[04-May-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
I know its not same thing i didnt find another coin to compare i know that Chips supply is mostly not held by the team

[04-May-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so how it is centralized?

[04-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
compare it to many other microcaps that have around 100 miners

[04-May-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
which is most all of them

[04-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
just place decent bids on coinexchange.io and I am sure some holders will sell

[04-May-19 10:36 AM] Markus#5464
I think this is why many small coins have a issue to grow cause those ppl being early to mine it will have majority of the supply so then other ppl dont want to invest into those so they never grow

[04-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody can do this at anytime. there is no centralization

[04-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS can be purchased for many years for pennies

[04-May-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
now people complain that they didnt because finally there is a GUI around the corner

[04-May-19 10:37 AM] Markus#5464
This is just what i was talking about

[04-May-19 10:37 AM] Markus#5464
New ppl who want to get in and they see it like they missed it and compare it to the ppl who got in early

[04-May-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
actually the people that "got in early" paid a much higher price than what it is selling for, so not sure what your point is

[04-May-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the hashrate for CHIPS basically immediately went very high

[04-May-19 10:38 AM] Markus#5464
what about the block reward

[04-May-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
well over 10 cents mining cost

[04-May-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
at basically all stages of the mining

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] Markus#5464
okay so there is no halvening occuring?

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it halved many times

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
hashrate declined as it halved

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] Markus#5464
Ok

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the mining cost was something like 25 cents to 50 cents at the peak

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] Markus#5464
when it launched how much did 1 block give compared to today?

[04-May-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so people complaining they missed out and it is centralized like XRP are not based on facts

[04-May-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
50 CHIPS at first, now fraction of CHIPS

[04-May-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
mining is not a good way anymore

[04-May-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
but it should be possible to purchase around 10 cents to 20 cents

[04-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
which is still lower than all but the earliest of miners who had less than a week of relatively low hashrate, if I remember right

[04-May-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont want to buy because there were only 100 miners, fine, but please dont slander the CHIPS and compare it to XRP

[04-May-19 10:41 AM] Markus#5464
If mining it is not profitable and blockreward is so less what keep miners mining it?

[04-May-19 10:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
believing in the project....

[04-May-19 10:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
and to make sure the testers get their transactions mined

[04-May-19 10:43 AM] Markus#5464
Dont get me wrong i love KMD ecosystem and everything what u guys doing but some things might not always make sense, i look at it from a customer view how other ppl would see it. I have understanding for how things are being done but not everyone might like it

[04-May-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if they dont like a 100% PoW mined coin without any premine, founders fee, etc. not much I can do

[04-May-19 10:44 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yes I regret I got early in Chips, at current prices it's even cheaper, so I dont understand someone complainig he didnt got early

[04-May-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
people like to complain about everything

[04-May-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
Well yes thats true

[04-May-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry , i didnt send you personal emails to let you know about CHIPS

though if I did, then you would complain about spam

[04-May-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
I did announce it many times in the past

[04-May-19 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
i was lucky enough to be one of the first knowing about CHIPS and mining CHIPS. that's my luck, i still have CHIPS now and waiting for it to deliver its potential

[04-May-19 10:46 AM] jorian#4555
and i'm sure i'm not the only one

[04-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
everyone in slack at the time (over 1000) had the same chance

[04-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also on bitcointalk

[04-May-19 10:47 AM] Markus#5464
What is the plans to bring ppl to Chips?

[04-May-19 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
yes, it was more than fair launch

[04-May-19 10:47 AM] jorian#4555
i kindly invite you to the chips discord

[04-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it is up to the CHIPS community

[04-May-19 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
#chips

[04-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS will deliver the tech as promised, regardless of the years it takes, as predicted

[04-May-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is delivered, then what happens is up to the community, which has shown it is willing to contribute bounties, etc.

[04-May-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if people want to buy $200 mil per quarter like XRP, i am sure people wouldnt mind that

but for now it is community project, 100% PoW

[04-May-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
I have a idea, idk if its possible but it would be unique, Create a gambling website on the kmd blockchain with decentralized gambling with Chips used as a token. No 3rd party involved storing your Chips

[04-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there are already website on blockchain solutions, but the problem is the DNS

[04-May-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[04-May-19 10:51 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@Markus  check this out https://docs.chips.cash/en/latest/faq.html

I still like the namecoin .bit dns

[04-May-19 10:54 AM] jorian#4555
i think too many people expect people to dump

[04-May-19 10:55 AM] jorian#4555
see the shorts vs longs

[04-May-19 10:55 AM] jorian#4555
therefore btc will go up

[04-May-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if by "dump" you mean correct a bit to 5600 or so

[04-May-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but this +/- 3% per day is just normal fluctuations and if we are in the bull cycle, it doesnt need any reason to go up

[04-May-19 10:56 AM] Markus#5464
there is many possible scenarios really, we got a bullflag on 4 hour chart.   Could also retrace to around 5350 and create a lower high before going higher. Dont think bitmex guys would appreciate this many shorts getting profits

Someone has an appetite for arrr today

I'm expecting KMD pump some time in few weeks. It make sense for a token price to come down [in BTC] when it's price is tighed to USD (electricity cost when miner impact is high) while it does not make ssense for KMD. I think bots are thinking miners-wise and dumping prices for coins same for all. But since KMD is not tighed to USD it should recover to BTC price it has recently in the past, uless some other whales will impact price by selling.

[04-May-19 01:46 PM] Markus#5464
once btc will calm down and hype around it will settle down alts will start to shine once again

[04-May-19 01:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pump it to 480k sats

[04-May-19 01:47 PM] Markus#5464
Could be nice to see KMD price back to 30k+ sats

[04-May-19 01:47 PM] Markus#5464
but will take some time for sure ^^

[04-May-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
less than 2 months ago, price in BTC was double. then BTC decided to go up 50%+ and all altcoin prices have dropped, BTC dominance at 55%

[04-May-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
relatively speaking KMD is in same position on CMC

[04-May-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i remember last bull run, the altcoin prices all got "compressed", until BTC went sideways for a while and a lot of the BTC flowed into alts

[04-May-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
btc crashing as we talk

[04-May-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
maybe not crash

[04-May-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
but going down

[04-May-19 01:50 PM] klein#5233
damp it
