0/ It kills me to tweet about SEC rulemaking procedures, but given the confusion on #crypto twitter today, it feels necessary.

TL;DR -- the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed #bitcoin ETF until ~February 21, 2019.

strong pump -> crypto mainstream

[08-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@snowdamn when are they expiring?

[08-Aug-18 08:00 AM] snowdamn#2414
dump -> have to wait much longer

[08-Aug-18 08:01 AM] snowdamn#2414
@Cryptoon my comments do not involve expiration plays

[08-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fuck it maybe we are heading to 3k

[08-Aug-18 08:03 AM] snowdamn#2414
definitely a possibility

[08-Aug-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The price *should* follow the hash rate

[08-Aug-18 08:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If that starts falling we going to 3k

[08-Aug-18 08:03 AM] snowdamn#2414
but a strong BTC futures pump will mean crypto has already gone mainstream

[08-Aug-18 08:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
they rejected ETF because they cannot depend on current price feeds (agree)

[08-Aug-18 08:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
BTC futures Volume increase is the only thing that can change their mind without better price consolidation between exchanges

[08-Aug-18 08:07 AM] snowdamn#2414
not rejected, postponed decision

[08-Aug-18 08:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
üôè  for BTC futures pump here and all our worries for the future will be gone üòÉ

[08-Aug-18 08:10 AM] snowdamn#2414
KMD will follow

[08-Aug-18 08:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
the tricky part is that Volume increase will determine outcome

[08-Aug-18 08:16 AM] snowdamn#2414
can be true with dump, that's why i say üôè  for pump lol

[08-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Reel Em In#1495

[08-Aug-18 08:42 AM] snowdamn#2414

number of long positions vs number of shorts would be a better indicator though

Just getting started :abusedsmily:

[08-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah apparently everyone was supposed to sell to mystery buyer in december

[08-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then everyone would have tons of fiat, and we could all laugh at mystery buyer

[08-Aug-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúShould have sold to (null), mystery buyer!‚Äù
