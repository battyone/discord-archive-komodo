@PTYX blockfolio has a bug where the last period candle is sometimes fucked up, seen it across various coins in the app recently

[23-Jun-19 03:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
don't trust it

[23-Jun-19 03:52 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah it's taking into account the ETH trades which indeed dropped low but with very little volume.

[23-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Tek#5253
i don't know why zcash, makes no sense

[23-Jun-19 06:45 PM] Markus#5464
nope more like crypto addicted üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
dreams usually reveal good information and somethimes can even predict

[23-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
I dn't understand why zcash was the message

[23-Jun-19 06:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
go with logical mind üòâ

[23-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Tek#5253
cause I haven't really been looking at it

[23-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
ive dreamed of btc before when I was busy with it yes, obviously and yes thats maybe crypto addiction related

[23-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
however zcash makes no sense at all

[23-Jun-19 06:47 PM] Tek#5253
why zcash

[23-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Jun-19 06:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380

get ready for a 2k candle

[23-Jun-19 07:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
just delete your kmd private keys now.  that way, youll get the pain out of the way all at once, you wont have to watch and suffer as it goes to 1 sat

[23-Jun-19 07:05 PM] Oszy#5734
well it did move

[23-Jun-19 07:05 PM] Oszy#5734
wrong direction

[23-Jun-19 07:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
well, it only ever goes down, so what did you expect

[23-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Alexfrog#1338

ETH and the like are safe

[23-Jun-19 07:10 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Tek#5253
tomorrow is deff gonna be worse, my fiat is coming in and so is countless others

[23-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Tek#5253
im gonna buy bitcoin

[23-Jun-19 07:13 PM] yorklab#7270
The scary part is since institutional investors are now involved, BTC season could last for years, never giving the alts a chance to have a "season".

[23-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Markus#5464
cause ppl are hella stupid who sell...they dont realise if btc pump and kmd pump then u make twice the profit so why would u dump kmd

[23-Jun-19 07:13 PM] Markus#5464
make no sense if u look for profits

[23-Jun-19 07:14 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Because they think if  BTC is going to 100k they don't want to miss outüòÑ

[23-Jun-19 07:15 PM] Markus#5464
okay so if btc goes to 100k and kmd pumps at same time, what happens? they get more btc and value grew even bigger

[23-Jun-19 07:16 PM] Markus#5464
oh well cheaper kmd for me later, my 10x long on bitmex profits will buy cheap kmd üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Alexfrog#1338
bought 12.7k, thanks idiot dumpers üòÑ

[23-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Headlines of my national newspaper "Crypto enthusiasts see bitcoin flirting with $100.000... So every Joe Smoe that has some spare cash to gamble with is going in. They never heard of alts.

[23-Jun-19 07:17 PM] Alexfrog#1338
13.7k to 12.7k in like 10 minutes lol

[23-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
4 hour chart of btc shows it can go quite high

[23-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
indicators pretty much resetted

[23-Jun-19 07:18 PM] Markus#5464
resistance at 11600

[23-Jun-19 07:19 PM] richardt#2807
I agree that alt season may not happen for awhile.  Good time to load up on BTC.  Probably a big reason why KMD has been going down

[23-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lol there it is

[23-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

yassinkomodo 

[23-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Alexfrog#1338
arrr would be my #1 if i hadnt converted it back to KMD at like .1-.15

[23-Jun-19 07:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
thought KMD would go to 30k sats and arrr would be worth less than .1.   instead KMD to 12k lol

[23-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Raggardy#8007

[23-Jun-19 07:30 PM] richardt#2807
Although if KMD is able to deliver everything as promised in July, it could get very interesting

[23-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Tek#5253
