I understand zec prices lowering because of new more efficient miners.
so, how does the future of zec looks like?

[09-May-19 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
tech wise I kinda trust zec

[09-May-19 10:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I trust way more kmd, way way way more....

[09-May-19 10:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking that makes me think if I should move some value from zec to other ü§î

[09-May-19 10:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be other way.....

[09-May-19 10:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
buy some more zec may be? ü§î

@jl777c what you think of zec James?

[09-May-19 10:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
maybe I'll just keep hodling whatever lil/more I have in zec ü§î

[09-May-19 10:39 AM] Alright#0419
I'd much rather put money into XMR than ZEC. Seems ZEC team would be much easier to subvert by an intelligence agency than XMR's "team"

[09-May-19 10:41 AM] Alright#0419
They had what was basically a network killswitch in their code until @dukeleto wouldn't stop complaining about it. A killswitch that would have cost about $100k to flip, but a killswitch nonetheless

[09-May-19 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree, but I still don't like to buy XMR.

[09-May-19 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if it comes to buy XMR, I'll instead just buy some PIRATE

[09-May-19 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking about tech wise more, and prices wise lesser, I'm evaluating things again, the reasons to keep holding ZEC

[09-May-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
ah nope, I'm mistaken

[09-May-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Would you not need a direct connection to EVERY node to shut them down though?

[09-May-19 10:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
because a node would shutdown and stop propagating the reorg.

[09-May-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
you would, yes

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
you can selectively remotely shut down nodes though

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
so....

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes would be terrible for exchanges and things... but only if they had open prots I think

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] Alright#0419
nope

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
how else do you force conenction to a node if it has closed ports

[09-May-19 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sit there waiting for it to connect you you then hit it with a reorg

[09-May-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
calling it a "killswitch" is more of a hyperbole, but it sure as fuck should not be there

[09-May-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
and it's been brought up multiple times, seems they don't care

[09-May-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
if you can sustain 51% on your fork for ~4.5 hours, you can essentially shut down the ZEC network. It would require human intervention to fix it seems, as you could shut it down over and over with the same fork

[09-May-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
it seems they don't care because 4.5 hours of 51% is a huge chunk of money, but there are surely entities that could do that.

[09-May-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
also don't forget that they knowingly implemented this üòâ

[09-May-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
it's not an unintended consequence of something else. They went out of their way to make it this way

[09-May-19 11:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Why tho

and cite mars as the reason :troll:

[09-May-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
`Here's another way to look at it. Suppose there's a shared blockchain between Earth and Mars, and then some cosmic event regards it impossible to communicate between the two planets. We can all tell that the cosmic event is going to last two earth years, and then normal communication will be restored. We all know that Earth has a lot more mining power than Mars. But, you live in Mars. What do you do?`

[09-May-19 11:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Who knows wh6y it is there, maybe to screw over people who fork it without knowing what they are doing? 
KMD is basically immune to this, as long as a single notarization happens within the MAX_REORG_LENGTH  it will never try to reorg more than MAX_REORG_LENGTH... this was a very recent change I made to it, that caused a few bugs at first, but seems to be working as intended now. 
komodod flat out bans anyone trying to push a chain that is older than the last ntoarized height. So it never enters this silly block of code.

[09-May-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
yea this was fixed in KMD about a year ago

[09-May-19 11:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you coul dstill do it actually I think. BUt it was pretty hard to do

[09-May-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
many zcash forks still have it though

[09-May-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
have tried to warn as many as I could find about it though

[09-May-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
XSG and CMM removed it, not sure who else

Didn‚Äôt @jl777c say they needed to sustain over 100 btc/24hrvol to remain ‚Äúviable‚Äù?

[09-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
There is a dual miner for VBK/ETH. You can mine a fair amount of VBK for basically nothing if you're already mining ETH with GPUs.

treasure 

[09-May-19 11:36 AM] Alright#0419
Meaning it's still profitable to mine at these prices from the eyes of an ETH GPU miner

damp it

[09-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
Did some napkin math the other day on it, with 2 1080tis, you got about $0.25/day extra

[09-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
compared to just mining ETH

[09-May-19 11:37 AM] Alright#0419
so ETH miners probably dumping it to hell

25 cents is 25 cents

[09-May-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
the difference between ~$1.75/day and ~$1.50/day for a miner is huge

[09-May-19 11:38 AM] Alright#0419
they'll keep going until it's $1.51 I imagine ü§£

[09-May-19 11:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Until it makes no cents it makes no sense not to damp it

@grewalsatinder ZEC price is in free fall for a few reasons. I highly recommend you don't buy any, but this is not financial advice üòÉ

[09-May-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
Z11 owners are battling A9++ owners to breakeven, Z11's got delivered first, and have no A9++'s to compete with, for a few precious days, until the A9++' batch1s are delivered and begin to compete. No matter the price of ZEC, both sets of miners will aggressively sell to try to break even

[09-May-19 12:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
Additional fun is Binance is one of the biggest ZEC/BTC pairs and miners cannot withdraw from it right now, which will cause some weirdness/premiums for zec/btc on other exchanges

[09-May-19 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder there is no short-term gain to HODLing zec, only short term risk, as sell pressure far outweighs buy pressure, just like VBK

[09-May-19 12:14 PM] dukeleto#7326

We might hit a bottom one day, but we haven't found it yet, and we can go much lower

[09-May-19 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you really truly think that ZEC technology will be massive in the future, buying various cheaper ZEC forks has a lot more upside, since they are all way undervalued compared to ZEC
