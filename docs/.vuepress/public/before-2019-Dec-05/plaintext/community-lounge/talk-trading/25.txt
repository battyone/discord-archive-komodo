I've seen guys spend 2 years earnings on trying to make 1 ASIC "workable" in their house ðŸ¤¦

[27-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
from loudness?

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
noise, heat, space

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
heat is fine... I want free heating. thats why I built mining rig

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Would australia heat kill em? slightly less profitable? Or just heat problems if someone owns 100s of them at once

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
stacked

[27-Jun-18 12:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but noise is unbearable... just cut down a tree and light a fire ðŸ¤£

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Nar... heat is fine, it depends how your house is

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Im honestly thinking of liquidating all my kmd

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
all in miners

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
LOL.

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there anything else to consider or any unknown cons or possible failures

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I have evaporative aircon  so I closed my whole house excpet one window and put the miner in there...

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
How I see it, someone who doesnt plan to sell kmd, someone who has a house

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
theres no reason not to sell kmd for mining

[27-Jun-18 12:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
didnt cost any extra as aircon was on anyway and already has to vent outside

[27-Jun-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd advice getting them, but advise anyone that isn't 100% committed to being a professional miner to not over-extend

[27-Jun-18 12:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if your using refrigerated in aussie summer... you wil have to turn them off at middle of day

[27-Jun-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
ambient air in temp is less significant than a good air out flow

[27-Jun-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
100F in will still cool the boards/chips as long as you get the 115+C air out

[27-Jun-18 12:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Data centers im in are evap cooling only

[27-Jun-18 12:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Theyâ€™re fucking miserable

[27-Jun-18 12:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But they work

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
110*F and humid in the hot aisles

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_does have an evap in his setup_

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Blasting multiple funneled reject shop fans at a tunnel containing miners, with grow house duct connecting them to the chimney, pointing down? ðŸ˜‚

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or we talking need some proper hardware to cool them LOL

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
or some bong engineer shit will work

[27-Jun-18 12:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yep evap and a floor fan did my stuff well last summer, no overheats or crashes, and cost nothing extra.

[27-Jun-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
turn off evap aircon, and the room was 60C in an hour

[27-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
So itâ€™s settled

[27-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We all crash Komodo to go all in on miners

[27-Jun-18 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my entire house was venting through the mining room.

[27-Jun-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
air flow to exhaust hot air, wihtout it... cant do it

[27-Jun-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I use "attic fans" to pull the heat away and just floor vents and 1 building outflow fan

[27-Jun-18 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
45C days tho

[27-Jun-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
natural air in, forced air out

[27-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Any idea if data centres would lend out space at a reasonable price

[27-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
say I grab 10 20 miners, would it still be profitable if im paying them to rent out

[27-Jun-18 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
a little corner or something ðŸ˜‚

[27-Jun-18 12:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only reason I added the evap is because our humidity is 70%+ from Feb-Oct ðŸ˜¦

[27-Jun-18 12:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Humidity is ridiculous here

[27-Jun-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
for 100 different reasons, I never advise on rentals one way or the other

[27-Jun-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
profitable rentals (no matter which side you're on) is work if you're looking at any meaningful profits

[27-Jun-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if your in brisbane or north odf that, evap isnt going to work.

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The DC where my notary is in Perth, has a whole rack of miners.

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You can put them in DC, but most wont accept them.

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
May as well get some of my family in hongkong

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they havent got the power. My DC had to get an extra generator and another feed from western power put in

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
to chuck this shit into their attics LOL

[27-Jun-18 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I micro-manage shit too much  to use a dc

[27-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I work in dcâ€™s too much to want to use a dc

[27-Jun-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[27-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just secured a place at a mates mates computer shop who already mines... now just gotta grow the balls to pull the trigger and sell ðŸ˜‚

[27-Jun-18 12:46 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ah so cant buy them just now

[27-Jun-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
hashrate can easily double between now and then

[27-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Youâ€™re out your capital for 2 months

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even so 7 8 months roi

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
is a lot better than what I expected

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
might go up 5x

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"and I make back the cost
and I just buy another batch"
Awful brave prediction for one sitting in the trading channel ðŸ˜›

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
HAHAHA thats me

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Il look into this a bit further, but it sounds like a viable option

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
thats for sure

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thatâ€™s why I wonâ€™t sell KMD

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Heat maybe

[27-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Waves is garbage, that can go

[27-Jun-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
actually with most all the equihsh coins changing parameters, it could be that KMD is the best ROI fo the ASIC miners and we get a 100x increase ikn hashrate

[27-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Damn shame Tezos hasnâ€™t launched

[27-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thatâ€™s worth a pretty penny now

[27-Jun-18 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
If ZEC changes K &N, KMD profitability will dump to dog shit

[27-Jun-18 12:50 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
mine highest profitable coin and buy kmd with it

[27-Jun-18 12:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I should do that, but I've got all my eggs in the KMD basket again

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah kmd has broken every rule for me hahaha

Dont trade emotionally - nope
Dont have all your eggs in one basket - nope
Know when to take profits - nope

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
but agree that if only asics are profitable on kmd that kmd will be a chinese dominated coin .. and i do not like china

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
#kmdlife

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
i have my eggs on ETC BTC KMD RVN

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
also some ETN

[27-Jun-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is too about the tech to get hung up on nationalism_

[27-Jun-18 12:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I got nothing against the chinese

[27-Jun-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I dumped almost all of my non cold storage BTC into more KMD

[27-Jun-18 12:53 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
now mining ETC .. can buy more KMD then

[27-Jun-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
how does having the 25% of the mined KMD make it dominatned by china?

[27-Jun-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
when mining is small percentage of 5% rewards

[27-Jun-18 12:54 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
