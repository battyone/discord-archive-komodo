well

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
even if its not ignored on all time frames

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
Which one are you gonna listen to

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
the 20 MA

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] nocturnal#2177
out of curiosity which TA metric combinations do you like? @Lanii

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
the 29?

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
30 MA, 40, 50, 200?, 500?

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
15 ema, 20 ema

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
Do you see my point?

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] dan.#2473
The one that looks like a puzzle piece fits üòÇ

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] dan.#2473
Yes

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
I trade market structure only

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] dan.#2473
I agree

[04-Aug-19 06:24 PM] Lanii#8302
pure price action

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
in what sense?

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
example

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
What levels do we need to hold and gain

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
to move up

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
what levels/zones do we need to fail to hold

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
/lose

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] Lanii#8302
to go down

[04-Aug-19 06:25 PM] nocturnal#2177
sure, thats what i do too

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
although pro traders do use TA combinations as aids

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
not as rukes

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
rules

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
typically

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Lanii#8302
tbh the only people that I've ever seen make decent money is with market structure

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Lanii#8302
Obviously there is never such thing as 100% sucess rate

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Lanii#8302
prob not even 90%

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah that is the main thing for sure, but they also tend to look for confluence

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] Lanii#8302
But at least I have some rules that I use that prevents me from getting destroyed if Im wrong

[04-Aug-19 06:26 PM] nocturnal#2177
as reassurance

[04-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302
yes

[04-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302
I posted a chart here a couple of days ago

[04-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Lanii#8302

[04-Aug-19 06:28 PM] Lanii#8302
the green box is the start of the move that took us to new local low

[04-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Lanii#8302
hence its an important level to break to keep going up

[04-Aug-19 06:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
My friend used to play that üòÉ

[04-Aug-19 06:29 PM] Lanii#8302
we are basically there atm

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
yeah thats what i do as well, its less pie in the sky than metrics

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
but i think its good to check some them as well

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] nocturnal#2177
but im only a hobby trader

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh everyone has their own style

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
if it works for you, keep doing it

[04-Aug-19 06:30 PM] Lanii#8302
anyway

Same thing with kmd

[04-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
I sold a bit at the green box

[04-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
You can see on the daily there is a small green candle

[04-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
That one took us to new lows

[04-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
hence its now a resistence

[04-Aug-19 06:31 PM] Lanii#8302
and it worked out

[04-Aug-19 06:32 PM] Lanii#8302
btw this was 1 day or so before Antara release

[04-Aug-19 06:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
one reason metrics have some wieght (the only reason?) is because lots of traders look at them and buy/sell in response so they become a self fulfilling prophecy

[04-Aug-19 06:33 PM] nocturnal#2177
and bots in particular

[04-Aug-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
Only bothered with the fact wether it works or not

[04-Aug-19 06:33 PM] Lanii#8302
Is it making you money or no üòÉ

[04-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Lanii#8302
preferbly btc and alts moon and die over and over in cycles

[04-Aug-19 06:34 PM] Lanii#8302
That way you can always reacumulate

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] nocturnal#2177
what im saying is, if the RSI (for example) says hugely overbought a proportion of traders/bots will def sell

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
you ll see the patterns you want to happen üëå

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
or fear ^^

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Lanii#8302
patterns are a meme :troll_lol:

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Lanii#8302
youd make more money longing every head and shoulder then shorting it on btc

[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Lanii#8302
since start of 2019

[04-Aug-19 06:36 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Aug-19 06:44 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I thought my Arrr buy at .13 was a steal, the market has proven yet again that I have no fucking clue what is going on

[04-Aug-19 06:45 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Still believe there will be a KMD/ARRR flippening, fundamentals of ARRR too stronk plus kmd moving at a snails pace

[04-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Might only be short term, but I'll be there to take advantage of it

[04-Aug-19 06:48 PM] dan.#2473

üçø one of our biggest whales jl777 said month or two ago that price was going back to $1. Jl777 trade bot master wishes for KMD to stay out of top 20 so as to stay under the radar. Assumably so as kmd has time to establish itself as unstoppable power house. Then and only then will the whale allow price to hit $150. üçø Sit back, relax, drink that shit, smoke that shit, and enjoy the ride for your enjoyment.
