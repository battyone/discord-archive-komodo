[13-Mar-19 06:14 AM] Markus#5464

[13-Mar-19 06:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
shoulda waited for now 😛

[13-Mar-19 06:20 AM] dxer666#8963
first huobi bought kmd in binance and add kmd to huobi...afther that they pump it. whalebro was huobi

[13-Mar-19 06:24 AM] Markus#5464
we might see 25k

[13-Mar-19 06:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
whalebro WAS huobi! yoinks!

[13-Mar-19 06:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
looks like we solved another one...

[13-Mar-19 06:37 AM] Alecandro#1179
Sad!

[13-Mar-19 06:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
quality entertainment nonetheless

[13-Mar-19 06:47 AM] Alexfrog#1338
real bounce time?

[13-Mar-19 06:53 AM] dxer666#8963
p & d without news

[13-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Keppie#5156
Bounce it

[13-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Keppie#5156
Let's just form a support on our previous resistance arround 29k

[13-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Keppie#5156
so in a week we can go like we used to say in the poloniex troll box

[13-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Keppie#5156
"Next leg up" 😄

[13-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Alecandro#1179
Sounds good to me!

[13-Mar-19 07:44 AM] sφldat#8733
Great volume!

[13-Mar-19 07:45 AM] sφldat#8733
Yesterday's Volume 	$1,937,233 USD

[13-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
when people say "no news" dont they realize there has been a lot of news in the recent months with price barely moving, so this is pressure that builds until one day it is unleashed. My theory is that every good news that has no price movement will someday create price movement "without news". It is a delayed effect. Do people really think that big whales read some news and then in the next hour buy millions of dollars worth? The news needs to be processed and digested and this takes time, so this could just be the AWS news effect. Or maybe just a fat finger by a large huobi trader and all the recent good news has no value at all

also if you look at orderbooks, there really isnt that much KMD for sale until you get to much higher prices. so to establish a truly large position in KMD requires paying a big premium

[13-Mar-19 07:49 AM] Keppie#5156
Wise words

😂 

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
It wasn't that spectacular.

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] Tek#5253
38k sats is not spectacular?

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] Tek#5253
dude

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
120k sats on huobi

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] Tek#5253
: o

[13-Mar-19 08:41 AM] ch6ris#5240
😂

[13-Mar-19 08:42 AM] Tek#5253
Some big man bought up every coin on the market yesterday or what

[13-Mar-19 08:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
It was whalebro. It's been confirmed.

[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] ch6ris#5240
Big things coming. 120k is just the beginning.

[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] ch6ris#5240
Whalebro knows. 👌

[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
Yeah this way I can't sell early

[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
when its staking

[13-Mar-19 08:44 AM] Tek#5253
so that's nice

[13-Mar-19 08:45 AM] ch6ris#5240
Wait you mean acquiring interest right?

[13-Mar-19 08:45 AM] Tek#5253
yes

[13-Mar-19 08:45 AM] jorian#4555
rewards.

[13-Mar-19 08:45 AM] ch6ris#5240
ahhh. well technically not staking. 🤓

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] ch6ris#5240
yes rewards my bad ✊

✌ 

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Tek#5253
all good projects visited their previous floor

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Tek#5253
the floor they had when they were at 6k

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Tek#5253
in about 1 hour

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Tek#5253
then came back down to about half of it

[13-Mar-19 08:46 AM] Tek#5253
when bitcion was at 6k*

[13-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Funkyball#2786
Hows does the rewards thing work? I only have 500 KMD, is that enough to get rewards?

[13-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Tek#5253
yeah you can stake any amount

[13-Mar-19 08:47 AM] Tek#5253
more than 10*

[13-Mar-19 08:47 AM] ch6ris#5240
yes 10

[13-Mar-19 08:47 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Min is a 10utxo

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] ch6ris#5240
Agama is the easiest way to claim.

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] Funkyball#2786
Ok, so I send 500 KMD to agama abd just leave it? What kind of ROI is it looking at

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jorian#4555
you have to claim every 30 days

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] ch6ris#5240
was it 10.1% pa

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jorian#4555
basically doing a transaction

[13-Mar-19 08:48 AM] ch6ris#5240
claim once every 30 days

[13-Mar-19 08:49 AM] ch6ris#5240
or earlier don't think it matters to much.

[13-Mar-19 08:49 AM] Tek#5253
I think it was 5%

[13-Mar-19 08:49 AM] ch6ris#5240
yeah, probably.

[13-Mar-19 08:49 AM] Keppie#5156
5.1% yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[13-Mar-19 08:50 AM] Tek#5253
5% is nice

{Reactions}
🆒 

[13-Mar-19 08:50 AM] Tek#5253
10% then is bit much as whales dump the price with interest all the time

[13-Mar-19 08:51 AM] ch6ris#5240
anyhoo. Very entertaining. 😄

[13-Mar-19 08:52 AM] Keppie#5156
What's the story behind Whalebro ?

[13-Mar-19 08:53 AM] Funkyball#2786
Nice thanks guys

[13-Mar-19 08:53 AM] ch6ris#5240
He buys komodo in large quantities 😋

[13-Mar-19 08:54 AM] ch6ris#5240
The price doesn't matter to him. He just wants it now.

[13-Mar-19 08:54 AM] ch6ris#5240
Someone's gotta bring a little culture. 😂

[13-Mar-19 08:59 AM] ch6ris#5240
Search whalebro in this channel, The results are pretty funny. 😂

[13-Mar-19 09:54 AM] LocoMB#8593
hey- looks like I slept through that sudden Huobi party!
anyway, still nice to see stuff like that when waking up!  ☕

[13-Mar-19 10:10 AM] Keppie#5156
Bounce on the 0.786 fib level ? 27k sats that is

[13-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Sherdogz#6731
So what would be the pest price to buy back?

[13-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Keppie#5156

[13-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Funkyball#2786

[13-Mar-19 10:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So we had a resistance break pump and and retest?

[13-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Keppie#5156
Basically yes. Smart money buys the retest now. 🙏

[13-Mar-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Mar-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure to sell as soon as you get 6% gain!

[13-Mar-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

Btc is making some weird moves again, I'm waiting to rebuy kmd

[13-Mar-19 11:13 AM] Funkyball#2786
Im buying back in now, happy to take the extra KMD even if it goes back below 25k but after a pump like that I'd be surprised

[13-Mar-19 11:36 AM] ch6ris#5240
Would be helping support a new level.
