there is this thing called math

[24-Feb-19 06:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
which gets manipulated for good marketing soundbytes, i know

[24-Feb-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
The design of Dilithium is based on the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" technique of Lyubashevsky which uses rejection sampling to make lattice-based Fiat-Shamir schemes compact and secure. The scheme with the smallest signature sizes using this approach is the one of Ducas, Durmus, Lepoint, and Lyubashevsky which is based on the NTRU assumption and crucially uses Gaussian sampling for creating signatures. Because Gaussian sampling is hard to implement securely and efficiently, we opted to only use the uniform distribution. Dilithium improves on the most efficient scheme that only uses the uniform distribution, due to Bai and Galbraith, by using a new technique that shrinks the public key by more than a factor of 2. To the best of our knowledge, Dilithium has the smallest public key + signature size of any lattice-based signature scheme that only uses uniform sampling.

lol

[24-Feb-19 06:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
not sure if that means anything to you

[24-Feb-19 06:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
but use some common sense

[24-Feb-19 06:59 PM] jl777c#5810
https://pq-crystals.org/dilithium/index.shtml

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
important is that it means stuff to the quantum math guys at NIST

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
how can you know the capabilities of a quantum computer before they exost

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
you have to make meaningless assumptions

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
really?

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] nocturnal#2177
yep

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
can you imagine a normal computer with 100TB of RAM?

[24-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and what you could do with 100TB of RAM

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
exactly - you are assuming a random number

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
even though you cant build such a computer

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats my point

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
no, your assumption is that you need to have something existing to know what it can/cant do

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
you cant make a calcuation without anumber

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
I disprove this

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
and the number is not known yet

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
so therefore it is meaningless

[24-Feb-19 07:01 PM] nocturnal#2177
or a guess rather

[24-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a guess that there is no known quantum algo that solves this dilithium lattice problems

[24-Feb-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
while there is a proven math algo that shows that secp256k1 is solved efficiently with quantum algo

[24-Feb-19 07:02 PM] nocturnal#2177
how many qbits are assumed in teh quantum computer?

[24-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure the assumption is regardless of qbits

[24-Feb-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it must tap into some sort of hashing like quality, which also is not having a known quantum algo to solve it

[24-Feb-19 07:03 PM] nocturnal#2177
until someone finds one with a quantum computer....

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
how many years forward are you inagining?

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
in this assumption

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
10?

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
1000?

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You argue about knowing the capabilities of a quantum computer and then demand to know how many qbits of unknown power are assumed for this determination of security

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
its pretty mucvh meaningly to call something quantum resistant in 2018

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes that is my point

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] nocturnal#2177
we cant know

[24-Feb-19 07:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
87,000,000 qbits are assumed

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] nocturnal#2177
lol

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Alright#0419

exactly

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] nocturnal#2177
meaningless number

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
how many qbits does sha256 resist?

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
87

[24-Feb-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems a meaningless question as there is no known quantum algo for reversing sha256

[24-Feb-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of qbits

[24-Feb-19 07:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
*ahem*

[24-Feb-19 07:06 PM] nocturnal#2177
theoretically you can map every molecule of non-dark matter in the universe with a 32 qbit quantum computer

[24-Feb-19 07:06 PM] nocturnal#2177
but your telling me you cant reverse sha256...

[24-Feb-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so the concept here is to make new algos without some already known way that quantum computer can solve.

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
well maybe you can map all matter, but have it emit your gps coordinates

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just because you can map everything, doesnt mean you become omniscient

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
also quantum computers have been "10 years away" for decades

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] nocturnal#2177
just dont believe the hype dude ðŸ˜ƒ

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not clear how practical they will be at the more useful sizes

[24-Feb-19 07:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fusion powered quantum computers

[24-Feb-19 07:08 PM] Alright#0419
is this only useful in the event that sha256 is broken or are there other usecases?

[24-Feb-19 07:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
quantum computers will be a lot longer than 10 years away

[24-Feb-19 07:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
agree

[24-Feb-19 07:08 PM] nocturnal#2177
so saying something is quantum resistent even more silly

[24-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sha256, i repeat AGAIN, there is no known quantum algo tosolve sha256 and hashing is hard to reverse

[24-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the secp256k1 and curve25519

[24-Feb-19 07:09 PM] nocturnal#2177
it means a mathematician has decided one possible scenario involving a theoretical quantum computer that doesnt exist yet, is defended against ðŸ˜‚

[24-Feb-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
all the public key crypto that has a known algo to solve it very quickly using quantum computers

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it means no mathematician has come up with a way for quantum computers to solve it

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
which seems a lot safer than something that is known to be solved

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] nocturnal#2177
wait wait,

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the logic is that it is better to use something that has no known solution, than one that does

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] nocturnal#2177
you saying there that its NOT quantum resistant

[24-Feb-19 07:10 PM] jl777c#5810
public key algos are NOT quantum resistant

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
you are saying it is resistant WITHPOUT quantum computing

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
or up till quantum computing

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
once we get big enough quantum computers, all of the non-cold storage pubkeys will be cracked

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] nocturnal#2177
yes agreed

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be 50 years...

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be 10 years

[24-Feb-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless, it is possible for it to happen

[24-Feb-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and if it does, do you want something we know 100% for sure will be cracked, or something that currently there is no known quantum algo for?

[24-Feb-19 07:12 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It might be 13 years, 4 months, 9 days ago

[24-Feb-19 07:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
absouletly

[24-Feb-19 07:12 PM] nocturnal#2177
I take issue with the misleading term used for marketing

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
not the progression of technology

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
as fast or slow as that may be

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
quantum resistant is the industry accepted term

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
i would wager a mathemetician didnt come with that term

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
and more to the point

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
industries accept terms

[24-Feb-19 07:13 PM] nocturnal#2177
that sell things

[24-Feb-19 07:14 PM] nocturnal#2177
and make things in the industry sound good

[24-Feb-19 07:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I feel your synergy bro

[24-Feb-19 07:14 PM] nocturnal#2177
haha

[24-Feb-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then you come up with a name for something that is qualitatively more secure against quantum computing than the existing public key crypto

[24-Feb-19 07:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
once you remove the quantum claim it doesnt sound as sexy

[24-Feb-19 07:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
thats what im saying

[24-Feb-19 07:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
but im sure there are a many such terms

[24-Feb-19 07:17 PM] nocturnal#2177
do you mean 'quantitively' more secure?

[24-Feb-19 07:18 PM] Acura#2748
Piratechain not quantum Resistent because of no available CC, right ?

[24-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i would say that having no known quantum algo is qualitatively better than one that is known to be solved with quantum algo

[24-Feb-19 07:20 PM] tolken#2655
Shit, kmd overhyping shit again. Hey marketing; ratchet it down a few notches!
