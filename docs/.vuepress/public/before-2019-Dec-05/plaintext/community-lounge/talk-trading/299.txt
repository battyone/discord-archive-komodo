BCH went from ~$400 to $500 value, now BCHABC is $250 and SV is $50

[21-Nov-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
+/- 30%

[21-Nov-18 12:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
madness isnt it

[21-Nov-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but with SV idiocy, exchanges are forced to declare ABC as the true BCH, so the net effect is in exchange for a silly SV coin, BCH value is cut in half

[21-Nov-18 12:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
best comment i saw on polo twitter "what is bchabc and sv and where is my bch!" lmao

[21-Nov-18 12:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it has deff divided the camps which ultimaltey hurts crypto

[21-Nov-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure there is any real SV "camp"

[21-Nov-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it was just a few guys trying to do a hashrate takeover (even though that doesnt work technically) and then crying about cheating when the other side rented hashrate

[21-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is all about the hashrate, then you cant cry about the other side renting

[21-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no crying in a hashrate war

[21-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
not that any hashrate war actually existed for a single chain, as there are two chains, the moment different rules went into effect

[21-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
no matter how much hashrate, it wont change the ABC rules back to SV rules

[21-Nov-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
now they deployed a 10 block reorg, then after 10 blocks there is a very good assurance it is final

[21-Nov-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so what on earth does the hashrate of SV have to do with ABC chain??

[21-Nov-18 12:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
When its laid out like you have explained it, its irrelevant

[21-Nov-18 12:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
so it is just look here we have more hash we win

[21-Nov-18 12:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What is your thoughts on craigs "there will be no bitcoin end of 2019" just hot air ?

VRSC staking is such high ROI

[21-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
buy vrsc/btc on the cheap sell vrsc/kmd sell vrsc/btc again, end with more btc

[21-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
more btc to buy more vrsc

[21-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What I am trying to say is

[21-Nov-18 02:42 PM] snowdamn#2414
no catastrophic event (so far)

[21-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
the idea behind SV claiming they would be reorging ABC was that they would keep the blocks compatible with SV

[21-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
if that makes sense

[21-Nov-18 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
as in they would reorg to remove things with new ABC OP codes

[21-Nov-18 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
but it simply never happened

[21-Nov-18 04:53 PM] Alright#0419
no attacks at all as far as I can tell

[21-Nov-18 04:58 PM] yorklab#7270
With some excchanges now trading ABC as BCH, and with the SV camp holding millions of ABC from the fork, I think it would be scary to trade BCH when the SV camp could (temprorarly anyway) distroy the price of BCH if they wanted to.

[21-Nov-18 05:18 PM] KaizySozy#0248
i hope it goes down a lot further so i can just buy it up lol

[21-Nov-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@yorklab but the sv camp would also destroy themselves

[21-Nov-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
nobody likes to see their holdings turn to 0

[21-Nov-18 05:55 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Then they shouldn't hold shitcoins like BCH :trollface:

Komodo's 5% rewards are not dividends

Yup you are correct

```The term dividend, in its technical as well as in its ordinary acceptation, means that portion of its profits which the corporation, by its directory, sets apart for ratable division among its shareholders.```

`you can earn passive income from` and  `dividend paying` are not synonymous (neither grammatically or legally)

[22-Nov-18 02:43 AM] ryman112#0068

No shit sherlock.  I told the guy to change his title.  I cant help the fact ryhat he doesn't understand the difference all I can do is tell him

The BitMex bans of US citizens pisses me off even more. Of course, that is what VPN's are for... not that I advocate circumventing anything (LOL üòã ). So, being purely speculative about this, I'd imagine that a person would have to be consistent with the VPN country selected, watch out for identifiers such as a US only based email, or withdrawing/depositing with any type of possible identification of nationality. Would love to hear thoughts about this.
