[12-Aug-19 09:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@hastrup i understand that volume is low right now but for the future do i have to opt in or registrate my Dex address te receive my piece of the fees?

[12-Aug-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810

[12-Aug-19 09:02 PM] CoinKing88#1540

a snapshot is made of all addresses and revshare paid out proportionally

[12-Aug-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter who controls which address

[12-Aug-19 09:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Ok sweet, good night all 👍🏻

[12-Aug-19 09:04 PM] hastrup#8742
And that is the beauty of the DEX token

[12-Aug-19 09:06 PM] hastrup#8742
@CoinKing88 good night :)

[12-Aug-19 10:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c would love to hear your thoughts surrounding the game theory behind market makers in relation to providing liquidity to our DEX.

I see it as a race to the bottom initially, then people will drop out then people can raise fees and the cycle repeats. Do you see it playing out that way?

[12-Aug-19 10:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just like BTC miners and how people drop off when they dont profit, then diff drops or prices go up and people get back in

[13-Aug-19 01:35 AM] AkiraX#8269
anyone like hush at this price?

[13-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jspook16#3059
Probably better off with pirate

[13-Aug-19 04:22 AM] AkiraX#8269
Haven't really followed pirate

[13-Aug-19 04:23 AM] bishop#9773
you should, there isn't another privacy coin with the pool set that ARRR has.

[13-Aug-19 04:23 AM] bishop#9773
plus it's getting stupid cheap again 😄

[13-Aug-19 04:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
I was mining a bit before.  But so scared about private addresses

[13-Aug-19 04:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
Dunno if I'm setting up wallet correctly

[13-Aug-19 04:24 AM] AkiraX#8269
Verus agama?

[13-Aug-19 04:25 AM] AkiraX#8269
What's a pool set?

[13-Aug-19 05:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
I always wondered about the use case of HUSH - until it dawned on me that it is rather about secure messaguing not currency

[13-Aug-19 05:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
anyone remember 'Bitmessage'? that was sort of cool.. However, it totally _hogged_ your CPU, permanently, unacceptably- HUSH oth is a blockchain based secure messaging system

[13-Aug-19 05:42 AM] tolken#2655
@hyperDEX I had an automatic mm1.0 to cex goin a year ago, just barely anyone would use it, so finally took it down. I’m sure that’ll change with the new mm2.0. No excuses this time, the beta has been amazing so far.

[13-Aug-19 05:52 AM] bishop#9773
@AkiraX The anon pool set. A currency that forces every user to transact privately is better than any other currency that gives you optional privacy.

[13-Aug-19 05:58 AM] dan.#2473
Nice action

[13-Aug-19 06:04 AM] tolken#2655
Yes, nice to come up for a bit of air

[13-Aug-19 06:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
10btc buywall at 7,770 sats

[13-Aug-19 06:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
got the bots riled up

[13-Aug-19 06:36 AM] tolken#2655
Tingles

[13-Aug-19 07:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@tolken This will be a professional setup basically click and forget

[13-Aug-19 07:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Grandma will be able to click it.

[13-Aug-19 07:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
For us, it will be a addon to hyperDEX, otherwise people can use CLI or other GUIs that build it

[13-Aug-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
@hyperDEX assuming that people are making risk free 5% and this becomes known to others and it isnt so hard to get setup, then it does seem a very likely scenario. the problem is that each 5% mm is incentivized to keep it secret so he can make his 5% as long as possible and so the process isnt directly self-perpetuating. However, if the takers are understanding that the makers on the other side are making a "free" 5%, then maybe some of them will want the 4% for themselves

[13-Aug-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and similar to mining as you say, an equilibrium will be reached

[13-Aug-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
Henlo sirs.

[13-Aug-19 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
Awaiting moon.

[13-Aug-19 09:36 AM] mobipoi#5774
In addition to that the taker must want to use dex in the first place and pay a premium

[13-Aug-19 09:39 AM] mobipoi#5774
As opposed to using CEX so maybe binance removing 40% of the users base and placing them in a restricted market helps, there are also small caps coins that with passionate community looking for alternatives

[13-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
there are also the direct makers that have inventory not on CEX, so there is price competition with that also, but initially the higher volumes will be via CEX indirectly

[13-Aug-19 09:40 AM] mobipoi#5774
Oh yeah that's true

[13-Aug-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if just one whale in a coin community sets up atomicDEX marketmaking, that allows everyone to be able to trade into and out of that coin

[13-Aug-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
that increases the value of that coin

[13-Aug-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is in the interests of the whales in each coin community to create this liquidity to enhance their coin value

[13-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
LTC proves that liquidity in a coin has a lot of value, as that is really LTC only value

[13-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and once a whales starts marketmaking, then they will realize the power of the liquidity multiplier. 1 BTC worth acts as 10BTC, or 20BTC or more, depending on how many orders are made. so even with just 100 BTC worth of total liquidity, we would get overall liquidity equivalent to thousands of BTC

[13-Aug-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but all this will take time, as it is new territory and people wont instantly go from not using atomicDEX to providing 10 BTC across 20 order pairs

[13-Aug-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
by "BTC" i mean the equivalent of one BTC worth of coins

[13-Aug-19 09:44 AM] Lumbi#8378
Let's assume KMD will be the first coin to implement MM.  would there be floating orders that adjust  based on market conditions? what would the algo look like?

[13-Aug-19 09:44 AM] mobipoi#5774
Liquidity multiplier effect is one killer feature,

[13-Aug-19 09:46 AM] mobipoi#5774
It allows  arbitrage opportunities most importantly it's leverages capital

[13-Aug-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
there is already a project to implement a marketmaker using external prices

[13-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@mobipoi yes, you can place the ridiculously low orders to catch the big dumps for 100 coins, without having to tie up your KMD. It will still be earning rewards too

[13-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Tek#5253
🤔 what if you are a Kmdlet

[13-Aug-19 09:52 AM] mobipoi#5774
Traders will go mad for this , it like adding gasoline to a raging fire , will see, this can be one huge exponential explosion assuming this can scale up to demand spvn is probably now very important

[13-Aug-19 09:52 AM] Tek#5253
still anything to gain for kmdlets?

[13-Aug-19 09:53 AM] Tek#5253
maybe I should reprhase my question

[13-Aug-19 09:53 AM] Tek#5253
Henlo Sirs, Howmuch KMD to make it?

[13-Aug-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
Does one ever have too much kmd?

[13-Aug-19 10:31 AM] Bitfinger#6245
What language will the liquidity provider bot be programmed in?

[13-Aug-19 10:48 AM] Jimm B.#9993
How many DEX are there in total?

[13-Aug-19 10:48 AM] Acura#2748
1 million

[13-Aug-19 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
too general question, Jimm. please be specific 🤔

[13-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Acura ty

[13-Aug-19 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... I guess it was about the DEX asset 😅

[13-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@grewalsatinder yes🙂

👍 

[13-Aug-19 10:50 AM] Caglio#3337
so if k64 starting price will be 0.64$

[13-Aug-19 10:51 AM] Caglio#3337
is there any chance to get aat least 0.50$ before everyone dump it

[13-Aug-19 11:23 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
My crystal bowl says: unsure
My magic eightbal says: sure
The stars are smiling
Reading the guts af a fish tells me it's not possible.

[13-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Caglio#3337
I would say no, but good to know what did your magic said

[13-Aug-19 11:24 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
In other words: nobody knows until there's more official news

[13-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
That wasnt my question

[13-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
Lets say they didnt lie

[13-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
And they really start with that price

[13-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I never own a coin before it came on exchanges

[13-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I wanted to ask how much time it takes to get dumped ( cos probably everyone dumps it) specially @ that price

[13-Aug-19 11:26 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It's like having stock of a company that goes to a stock exchange. Nobody knows for sure what'll happen. It may moon, it may dump. That's the risk you take as an investor.

[13-Aug-19 11:28 AM] Caglio#3337
Well I can tell you already it wont moon

[13-Aug-19 11:28 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Depends on the official statements we're all anxiously waiting for.

[13-Aug-19 11:28 AM] Caglio#3337
But why would it moon even if they are true ?

[13-Aug-19 11:29 AM] Caglio#3337
Ok, goldman sachs invested that much money in it... so what ?

[13-Aug-19 11:29 AM] Caglio#3337
everyone who bought it at start paid less than 0.65, even I who got robbed 😄

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Lots of money in the gaming industry. Large market, big prices, huge potential...

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah but still

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
First ppl gonna dump

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
Thats somewhat logic to me

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
what is the current price of it ?

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
few cents ?

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
you start @ 0.64, thats like 10-12 times more

[13-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Caglio#3337
ofc I will dump that

[13-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Caglio#3337
everyone with a little bit salt in the head will do it

[13-Aug-19 11:31 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
It's not a quick-money investment.... A startup business is not likely to make money at first... Lots of investing to do. Maybe 5 years....

[13-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Caglio#3337
yeah, i am talking about

[13-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Caglio#3337
what happens the exact same moment it comes out to exchange

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] Caglio#3337
how much time it takes to get dumped from 0.64 to under a 0.50

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] Caglio#3337
prolly very fast

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That's quick money vision. I don't look at that. I only look for long term projects,,,

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] Caglio#3337
why ?

[13-Aug-19 11:32 AM] Caglio#3337
do you have 30 more years of life to spend ?
