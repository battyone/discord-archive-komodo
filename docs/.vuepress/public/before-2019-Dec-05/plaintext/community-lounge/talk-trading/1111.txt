I hope an actually legit company comes along to actually use all our awesome tech

[04-Sep-19 12:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
Another way of saying that is ‚Äúno legit company is using our tech.‚Äù  Ouch.

The part about NN mining big blocks well im not very surprised. If a system will allow u to do something like mining easier than others then obviously ppl will try to do their very best to exploit anything what would bring them more money

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if we didnt create a hunting pool, then i estimated 10+ NN would end up hunting instead of steady mining and that is not good

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, the big block mining 'exploit' doesnt surprise me and i dont blame some people for using it, its good that it got changed

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
with the hunting pool, it makes no sense for any NN to be a dedicated hunter as it is negative expected ROI

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
because the team donates 90% of hunted funds to the rest of the NN

[04-Sep-19 01:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
>If a system will allow u to do something like mining easier than others
gigapool was not a notary node miner, who was getting all big blocks.

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im just sad that it caused enough drama to make dwy leave.  hopefully people can start getting along and being productive again soon. üòõ

[04-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Markus#5464
Would it not be possible to change it so if a NN mines a block with lets say larger than 500 kmd then it auto split reward to all NN

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
its possible, but we just did a hardfork

[04-Sep-19 01:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
productivity will be back as soon as this dead subject dead again.

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] Alexfrog#1338
markus i think the solution already in place is bettr than that, it splits the rewards

[04-Sep-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it takes literally a couple months to get all the nodes updated and doing annual hardfork seems the practical, unless it is some sort of horrible attack. which this isnt

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also, the hunting pool is now setup to encourage teamwork. the better all the notaries do (best performing vs worst performing) the higher the payout

sorry for brinigng up the issue grewal, NNs dealt with this already but us in the public just heard of it now lol

[04-Sep-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so we turned an otherwise messy situation into the best outcome that we could come up with. now it rewards financially all the NN for helping each other do better

It was a headache catching up with that convo üò¶

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] Markus#5464
Ye indeed, im sorry too for talking about this we dont need negativity üëç

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we didnt make any public announcing of this as it is an internal NN matter and also it just got put in place in the last month

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i never forbade people from talking about it

[04-Sep-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not my fault nobody mentioned it before today

[04-Sep-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
some people feel that my decision that 75% of blocks should get 75% of revenues is very controversial, but i felt it wasnt really any big issue that i needed to immediately make some sort of public announcement about

[04-Sep-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
all the data is being publicly displayed on the notary stats websites, for anybody who wanted to follow such matters

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
also, i found that nothing you can do will make some people stop posting, the best seems to just ignore it and this was a very stressful topic especially consiering the timing. i didnt really feel motivated to go out of my way to explain it all over again

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] Markus#5464
How did u come up with 75%? Just trying to understand the thinking of the decision, was there any other options to consider?

[04-Sep-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i prefered to come up with some new tech, like nspv

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
75% is what the NN are currently mining via the easy mining

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it has been that way for over a year

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] Markus#5464
Lets say KMD price goes to 100$ one day, will NN still mine 75% or will it get adjusted?

[04-Sep-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
based on the consensus code, the NN could actually be mining 95%, but we are intentionally mining less so the external miners could get 25%

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but one of the external miners started sniping and NN ended up with significantly less than 75%

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] Alexfrog#1338
lol, so THATS how it started, an external miner caught on üòÑ

[04-Sep-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
at higher KMD prices, we can indeed change the 75% down but not less than 50%

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, until the external miner started sniping, there was peace in the land

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
once that happened, it destablised things, so we responded with the hunting pool

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] Alexfrog#1338
NNs were just peacefully exploiting the loophope all to themselves, until one day...

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] Alexfrog#1338
üòÑ

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[04-Sep-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
NN were intentionally mining only 75% instead of 95% that they could

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] Alexfrog#1338
ah

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and randomly NN would get big blocks

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and statisically if you get 75% of blocks, you expect 75% of total

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
starting end of last year, it stated being significantly less

[04-Sep-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we then identified a specific miner that was sniping the big blocks

[04-Sep-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
once we found that out, we solved why 75% of blocks wasnt getting anywhere near the 75% of total

[04-Sep-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so we worked on a solution and now are able to get much close to 75%

[04-Sep-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
THAT is the apparent controversy

[04-Sep-19 01:23 PM] Alexfrog#1338
well, keep creating tech.  maybe the market will eventually care, and not just dump everything for the original shitcoin that cant scale and has almost full blocks üòõ

[04-Sep-19 01:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is yeah, people can say it s just anger. This is not just anger. A decentralized organisation can t keep doing centralised stuff. I m ok being seen as a bad person again.  But the thing is that all of this should have been public far sooner. The point of that is that wether people admit or not, to be healthy and improve itself, an ecosystem need multiple type of people and minds. Revealing issues is key to improvement, but it s the ability to address them and fix before we come to a situation where after monthes nothing has been done.

[04-Sep-19 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes it s pretty hard to admit things, but it s the path to reconsider own choices, and find ways to improve, neglecting it is neglecting the fact that it was done to improve the system. Agility is key, and being too slow is not good. This space goes very fast, so the ability to fix is also a key to success

[04-Sep-19 01:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I told James I wanted to break pride and ivory tower, that meant being able to consider different opinions that may or may not help to move forward, and again, improve

[04-Sep-19 01:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can t prove anything without some facts. Unfortunately after monthes of saying stuff people didn t understand, this was the only way to get credibility. This must just evolve

[04-Sep-19 01:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
like KomodoWorld said, things must just change for the good of the ecosystem

[04-Sep-19 01:47 PM] Lumbi#8378
Maybe a KNIP channel could be created to hash out proposals...? It seems this situation has been mostly defused except for some ruffled feathers and shattered nerves?

@dukeleto you need to understand that disagreeing with you is possible, after last messages and tests I announced publicly, you jumped on conclusion about evilness, without taking the time to just try to understand

[04-Sep-19 02:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not big,  but zooko needs to get his head out of his butt

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog so many people hoping for a ZEC/BTC bounce, but man, there is a lot more room to go down

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
from what I hear, many A9++ owners have not gotten their machines, or are nowhere close to breaking even

[04-Sep-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
That means massive sell pressure still exists

[04-Sep-19 02:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
holding 0 ZEC soon after you last time raised their issues.

[04-Sep-19 02:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I believed in ZEC and held it a long time, but finally saw that my wishes and reality were not the same

[04-Sep-19 02:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That is correct machines still not here üò≠

[04-Sep-19 02:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog really sorry to hear that. I see a lot of A9's for sale on the cheap, so some A9++'s must be getting delivered

[04-Sep-19 02:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I was in the first preorder so they have to be coming soon ,  probably just getting the big guys filled first

[04-Sep-19 02:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog it should be interesting to see what ZEC/BTC price is once most A9++'s are delivered

[04-Sep-19 02:26 PM] Tek#5253
zec has a high inflation what do you expect

[04-Sep-19 02:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I hope it falls the way of the X3 and A900/2000 Basically they stop producing them ,  so it is the best miner left standing

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek the inflation has been constant for almost 4 years, lol

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
we talking about other forces at play, mining forces

[04-Sep-19 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
ASIC miners decide the price of ZEC and all equihash coins

[04-Sep-19 02:53 PM] Tek#5253
@dukeleto yeah well, if thereis a coin with 30pct inflation no one is going to keep it considering there are coins with a lot less

[04-Sep-19 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Tek hence why miners decide the price. They mine it and immediately sell it all

[04-Sep-19 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
yes and?

[04-Sep-19 03:00 PM] Tek#5253
we agree

[04-Sep-19 03:29 PM] dukeleto#7326

In line with general market flows, our OTC desk saw more altcoin sell flows compared to buy flows. Surprisingly, the buy/sell ratio was not as lopsided as one might expect with the current market conditions
