Non KYC crypto to fiat

[22-Feb-19 12:54 AM] PTYX#6840
Or more like "minimal KYC"

@meatspoon hey son, how's it going

[22-Feb-19 01:50 AM] Likewise#6767
check out the SPX500, is setting up for a good short position.

[22-Feb-19 01:51 AM] Likewise#6767
make your money there to buy crypto.

@Likewise Thanks, dad.  I can always count on you for excellent guidance!  I am so grateful we reunited just days ago and in such a fabulous discord channel.  Please don't mind my awful half-brother who constantly gives you grief.  He only got his mama's genes.  I am fully focused on crypto right now and, frankly, frightened of traditional markets which I dont have much confidence in at the moment.  I think the FED may punt here and there, but eventually they will raise rates enough to where the bottom will threaten to drop out and there will be a big dip.   Then we will see more QE or perhaps they will re-brand their scheme--either way, market paaaaamps.  Anyhow, too many manipulative variables for me to be comfortable playing right now.   Its a game I am reluctant to swing trade until I see the writing on the wall.  I have my long positions in equities and bonds.  I am young enough to ride out a significant storm.

[22-Feb-19 02:50 AM] Markus#5464
@Likewise u still trading stocks or just charting it now a days?

[22-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Likewise#6767
trading SPX500 usually

[22-Feb-19 03:38 AM] Likewise#6767
looking to get short

[22-Feb-19 03:41 AM] Likewise#6767
SPX mini futures 12.5$ per tick I tend to leverage X5.

[22-Feb-19 03:43 AM] Likewise#6767
SL around 2820....tp open I shift my SL as the position goes into profit, unless get stopped out of course 😃

[22-Feb-19 03:44 AM] Likewise#6767
@meatspoon you can use the future market to hedge your longs in case of a bear market. Then again, if you dont like the stress, buy and hold is ok son. 😉

[22-Feb-19 04:33 AM] Markus#5464
many dumpers today in kmd market

[22-Feb-19 04:37 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes, see if we get a bounce, this dicking around at same price range is not healthy

[22-Feb-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
daily chart looking funny

[22-Feb-19 04:37 AM] Markus#5464
23k to 27k range few days no change

[22-Feb-19 04:38 AM] Markus#5464
well 26k actually

[22-Feb-19 04:39 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed, little progress again. Where are the TA experts? They can point out on the daily what it means, there's a name for it 😉

[22-Feb-19 04:39 AM] Markus#5464
haha

[22-Feb-19 04:41 AM] Markus#5464
im quite new when it comes to charting but i quess u can tell me...is that a bull flag?

[22-Feb-19 04:42 AM] Likewise#6767
that candle on the 18th with long wick, sellers came in, fucked the bulls, see today.....could bounce, who klnows?

[22-Feb-19 04:44 AM] Likewise#6767
on the daily? not seeing a bull flag, then again as I said I TA keep it simple. S/R, fib levels, I'm really not into all sorts of lagging indicators and such. Patterns, yes they can be helpful.

[22-Feb-19 04:45 AM] Markus#5464
but u use moving averages?

[22-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Likewise#6767
yes I do, they ar also lagging of course

[22-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Markus#5464
ye sure ^^

[22-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Likewise#6767
but keep it simple, longer TF, above or below 200MA for long term trend

[22-Feb-19 04:47 AM] Likewise#6767
I use a 60 and 200

[22-Feb-19 04:47 AM] Markus#5464
yea, i started using fib around 2 months ago and seen it help alot

[22-Feb-19 04:47 AM] Likewise#6767
fib levels work well as S/R

[22-Feb-19 04:49 AM] Markus#5464
are u anytime trading crypto with leverage?

[22-Feb-19 04:51 AM] Likewise#6767
yes I did on bitmex when shorting BTC last year.

[22-Feb-19 04:52 AM] Likewise#6767
dont like bitmex one bit though, reminds me of the old FX days, markets starts moving, platform freezes amd more of them circus trics.

[22-Feb-19 04:53 AM] Markus#5464
Yea heard from ppl that actively used bitmex before that they do shady things

[22-Feb-19 04:53 AM] Likewise#6767
had a good run on it though, hence why I put the cash back into BTC and KMD but more as hodl positions. Find trading the SPX500 or other indices way more fun and rewarding.

[22-Feb-19 04:54 AM] Likewise#6767
waiting for KMd to hit 8 or 10$ and close shop 😃

[22-Feb-19 04:54 AM] Markus#5464
shop? 😄

[22-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Likewise#6767
meaning, trading, already now I trade a lot less actively then I used to, but add one good moon run on either BTC or KMD and my I'm done

[22-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Likewise#6767
been doing it for 13 years

[22-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Likewise#6767
time to fully retire instead of semi retire

[22-Feb-19 04:56 AM] Markus#5464
But trading 13 years, do u trade cause its fun or purely for the cash?

[22-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Likewise#6767
Good question, well it is my income and have done pretty well in returns last couple of years, so both really, but I'm happy to take a step back and take only a few trades per quarter if I like the set up I see.

[22-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Likewise#6767
hence I put quite an amount in KMD and BTC,  hoping for a times 3 to times 5 return on BTC and times 8 on KMD......wishful thinking? Who knows, according to my trading buddies in the traditional markets I'm dreaming. 😃 we will see. Dont put all eggs in one basket 😉

[22-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Markus#5464
ye well alot of "old school" traditional market traders seem to not take crypto seriously, but it seems like its been getting  better last months

[22-Feb-19 05:05 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes, some seem to be taken a more serious look at it. Personally, in crypto I get hated for saying it, in tradional markets not, at the end of the day, I do not really care what I trade as long as I get paid my cash which I use for my decadent life style 😃

[22-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Likewise#6767
KMD did give me an interest in starting to read about it all, now more impressed and believer then other tradional market guys

[22-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
I really believe KMD got a hella bright future, they are surprising over and over with new tech

{Reactions}
👍 

[22-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Likewise#6767
Yes I'm with you guys, otherwise I wouldnt be here ;). What I dislike about crypto is the endless forks and kidergarden behaviour from guys like Ver and Craig Wright, they hold the space back and give it a bad name.

[22-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Markus#5464
Thats very true

[22-Feb-19 05:09 AM] Likewise#6767
once all that is out of the way somehow and certain regulations are in place the projects that really offer something will survive and do well. Just my 2 cents

[22-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Markus#5464
Yea thats for sure, did you see the video about the huge issues with eos?

[22-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Likewise#6767
no, havent yet. Another saga?

[22-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Likewise#6767
EOs is that from that BRock guyy

[22-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Markus#5464
well their blockchain data is over 4TB in just 8 months and there is 5 blockproducers storing all that data

[22-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Likewise#6767
hmm. is the way it was supposed to go ? (insert scarcasm)

[22-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Markus#5464
haha, the guy who did the video mentioned if they wont solve it then the size would be over 100TB in 5 years

[22-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Markus#5464
could cause domino crash effect

[22-Feb-19 05:13 AM] Likewise#6767
ok, why is it even in 4th place?? Shouldnt it get hit by sellers?

[22-Feb-19 05:13 AM] Markus#5464
too many shilling it, i personally dont see any value in it at all

[22-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Markus#5464
not sure how circulating supply look like in eos either if its centralized like xrp

[22-Feb-19 05:15 AM] Likewise#6767
maybe in a few months from now that top 10 has other names in it, better names, dragon like names

[22-Feb-19 05:16 AM] Markus#5464
hopefully 😄

💯 

[22-Feb-19 05:17 AM] Likewise#6767
Volume on KMD didnt crash this time though. Usually after a prise rise volume would drop back to 30 BTC or so. Now we are at 348 BTC

[22-Feb-19 05:18 AM] Markus#5464
Yea that is a very positive sign i like it alot

[22-Feb-19 05:18 AM] Likewise#6767
yes

[22-Feb-19 05:18 AM] Markus#5464
the begin of something bigger 😄

[22-Feb-19 05:19 AM] Likewise#6767
lets hope so, but yeah I think there is a big chance this will take off. I'm trying to get some of my older buddies in lol

[22-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Markus#5464
will be really interesting to see kmd price end of upcoming bull market

[22-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Markus#5464
it can be surprising

[22-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Likewise#6767
indeed, can't wait

[22-Feb-19 05:21 AM] Markus#5464
what i hope for is when mm 2,0 is done and kmd wallet comes out with the decentralized exchange attached to it that there is good liquidity
