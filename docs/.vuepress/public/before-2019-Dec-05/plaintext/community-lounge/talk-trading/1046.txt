If nothing changes, than buying at 100 sats means shit

[07-Aug-19 08:52 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Aug-19 08:52 PM] Caglio#3337
nothing gonna change except accidental pump and dump

[07-Aug-19 08:53 PM] dan.#2473
theres irony in markets. things cannot moon until there is true capitulation. and by definition, that means most people probably won't ever see gains... because it literally can only go up if there is no selling pressure, so those people need to of sold already.

[07-Aug-19 08:54 PM] dan.#2473
sprinkle in unregulated markets and manipulation, and you got crypto markets in a nutshell

[07-Aug-19 08:56 PM] dan.#2473
anyways YOLO. i will buy down to 4k sats if it comes soon

[07-Aug-19 08:56 PM] dan.#2473
alts fell way too hard, and too fast

[07-Aug-19 08:58 PM] phideas#8309
Careful with capitulation. Some ppl still waiting for $1300 / BTC. It turned out capitulation was from 6 to 3.5k.

[07-Aug-19 09:01 PM] JimD#9272
No matter what the price there will always be a faglord saying it will go lower or it will go higher

[07-Aug-19 09:01 PM] JimD#9272
sometimes you just gotta call the ball and make the move

[07-Aug-19 09:01 PM] JimD#9272
Ive seen this on literally every single trading channel even when I have been right about lows and highs

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] JimD#9272
Im not right every time but honestly you really can't listen to others

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] dan.#2473

[07-Aug-19 09:02 PM] dan.#2473

The total founders reward to date, ~1.42M ZEC, could have generated ~ $245M if it was sold on the corresponding days it was received, $179.6M based on the historical median price of Zcash, or $254M based on its historical average price [GENESIS] https://t.co/vffA2gnGBp ~@d...

[07-Aug-19 09:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd raised what... a couple million usd at the time of ico?

[07-Aug-19 09:21 PM] scytale#8488
@Cryptoon don't further discredit yourself

[07-Aug-19 09:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok bro

[07-Aug-19 09:26 PM] phideas#8309
cca 80% btc dominance should hit channel resistance and trend reversal should start. this should pop long awaited altseason. target 40% BTC dominance. fingers crossed. not financial advice.

[07-Aug-19 09:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Cryptoon 2.5m or something

being down 50 or even 80% is nothing new if you've been in this game awhile.

a btc bull run is great for alts regardless of what any of the so called experts think

@actionslacks, me too, funny.

[08-Aug-19 04:02 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I think ICOs overheated the crypto market (lost overal trust to alts) since most icos are scams and money grab - and most people cannot distinguish other alts from icos they see all the same; so this bull run may be diff then the last time

BTC up and down and alrs double down

[08-Aug-19 04:03 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
for KMD it is very bad that there is not fresh money income - ecosystem needs fresh money, but currently :

[08-Aug-19 04:03 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
1. more old investors cashing out then new comming in

[08-Aug-19 04:04 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
2. internal KMD projects growing (new coming) and eating each other - using limited amounts available in the ecosystem, so every time new token comes, other will lose a bit.

There are obvious market operating behaviors, and the daily decline and proportion are very fixed, not a normal decline.

[08-Aug-19 04:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
there has definitely been some sibling rivalry but i chalk it up to growing pains. the different parts all make the whole thing stronger i would hope. This is a fascinating experiment in decentralized software development.
