It's nice to see the slow organic rise in price, but I do wonder why the larger buyers (Whalebro) have not entered into the fray; especially since the current price is lower than most of the previous buys the whale(s) made were done at a higher price. Other than that mini whale on the bid early on during this little run, we haven't really seen those huge bids we've seen in the past. Perhaps they're worried about bitcoin preventing Alt season from happening so they are sitting this one out for now.

[07-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464
My bet is Huobi or Coinbene

[07-Jul-19 03:36 PM] Markus#5464

[07-Jul-19 04:50 PM] Markus#5464
I dont think its so sure that BTC will go up from here....remember that btc usually does the opposite what ppl expect it to and 90% of ppl doing TA looking at the Inverse H&S pattern to playout

[07-Jul-19 04:53 PM] Markus#5464
Same goes for the previous H&S pattern a month ago or so when ppl were saying btc goes to 6-7k thats why it didnt cause ppl were expecting that to happen so it didnt

it's a bitfinex scam coin. the smart contract is written to be able to create/erase coins at will

[07-Jul-19 05:32 PM] actionslacks#4072

[07-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Seriously, somoene should just make "top of coinmarketcap coin", with a supply of 1 Trillion coins that they control, and sell 1 coin to someone for 1 dollar, and then claim the 1 trillion marketcap.  Thats all there is behind some of these shitcoins

BTC goes to 100K........

[07-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Andersen#8337
Very good ,  in other words  after  BTC  100K  -   KMD  move to 250 $

[07-Jul-19 08:52 PM] JimD#9272

it's gotta pump before the rebrand right?. fairly convinced a large percent of volume out there is fake. just bots building walls and flashing numbers.
