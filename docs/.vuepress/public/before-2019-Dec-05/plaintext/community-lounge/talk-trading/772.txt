[17-Jun-19 02:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User is right.  What happened in the US was government allowing/encouraging banks to issue loans to anyone and everyone for home purchases.  Then the banks packaged that toxic debt into bullshit debt instruments and resold it in a deceptive way.  So you had 1) a lot of Americans over-extending on their home purchases and 2) institutions and individuals setting themselves up to get rekt by buying the toxic debt.  This is a lot different than a communist government throwing a lot of fiat at crappy housing in an attempt to centrally plan the lives of its tax livestock.

[17-Jun-19 02:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so the govt owns the ghost towns? or real estate developers

[17-Jun-19 02:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
In a sense the Chinese citizens are on the hook all the same since the Yuan, just like any fiat, is debt created and pinned on the public.  But the dynamic of the Chinese housing bubble is quite different and will likely play out differently

[17-Jun-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
probably they will make the peasants pay for it

[17-Jun-19 02:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
maybe they will be "too big to fail" real estate developers...  I mean, i guess there are ways it could play out similarly, but it wont be the same

[17-Jun-19 03:39 PM] willofleo#7505
The Chinese housing issue really depends on the domestic population and ability to own those flat relative to their wages, so if the idea and hope is to invest in them based on appreciation of property price , then growth in the Chinese economy as a whole is needed and increase in wages and salary to meet up the loan payment and initial deposit for purchasement so it a ponzi scheme , as it must be empty because people cant afford it not sure if it an over supply issue as Chinese population is pretty dense ,

[17-Jun-19 03:41 PM] willofleo#7505
when is crashes that when it time to buy hard ,, plenty of those big massive units in bulk

No. When Bitcoin consolidates, Komodo goes back up. At least, that seems to happen. Komodo is going b ack up right now, a bit.

Is chain link a scam?

[17-Jun-19 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
not a scam, but they made their deal with google cloud services, sound like google is adopting it, but really it is somewhat like our deal with AWS. they are just making some chainlink stuff available via google cloud

[17-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Tek#5253
Oh ok got it

[17-Jun-19 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
also, they use the standard data aggregation enhanced with stake weight, which zack_bitcoin doesnt feel is going to work at scale, but certainly it solves a class of oracles use cases. not all oracles are about big money at stake

[17-Jun-19 08:23 PM] ryman112#0068
Chainlink has never been a scam dont listen to 4chan fud.  Solid project and the team has never been very big on shilling or giving out any bullshit.  Which is why I'm a fan of KMD they stick to their guns and keep perfecting their product.  Today has been a good day 🍻
