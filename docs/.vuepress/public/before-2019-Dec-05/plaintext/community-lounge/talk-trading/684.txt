[27-May-19 01:00 AM] dukeleto#7326

[27-May-19 01:00 AM] dxer666#8963
yes buy

[27-May-19 01:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
is that step-like pattern a normal thing to see?

[27-May-19 01:00 AM] dxer666#8963
good time

[27-May-19 01:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
is that exchange bots?

[27-May-19 01:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@dxer666 i was being snarky, and yes, I think it's a good time to buy too üòÖ

[27-May-19 01:04 AM] Alexfrog#1338
how do you post a picture in the chat dukeleto, it wont left me

[27-May-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alexfrog click the + to the left of the text input

[27-May-19 01:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is a plus, right were you type. Click that, and you can upload files. Sometimes drag-n-drop does not work, depending on if you are using native app or browser version

[27-May-19 01:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I dont see a +

[27-May-19 01:05 AM] Alexfrog#1338
drag and drop worked for me on other discords but not here

[27-May-19 01:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338

yeah its not there for me...

[27-May-19 01:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is the plus. I have never used the app

[27-May-19 01:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you don't have permissions, i am not sure

[27-May-19 01:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes, i see the + in other servers but not here

[27-May-19 01:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I guess the KMD overlords dont want me posting memes about the KMD price

[27-May-19 01:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah us plebs dont have permission

@Alexfrog sorry to flaunt my permissions, had no idea actually . My guess is a few people abused their meme privileges in the past üòÉ

[27-May-19 01:15 AM] Alexfrog#1338
not your fault üòÑ

[27-May-19 01:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Now it seems dumb after all that effort

[27-May-19 01:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
lol

[27-May-19 01:29 AM] yorklab#7270
Seems to happen every time there's even the smallest bump in price; the sellers are waiting to unload. It happens so often it's become a self fulfilling prophecy, kinda like TA charts; they know it's going back down so they practically fall over themselves trying to sell.

[27-May-19 01:29 AM] Alecandro#1179
So what I see is that someone market bought a ton of KMD right?

[27-May-19 01:29 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yes

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] yorklab#7270
Don't know if they market bought, but they bought a good amount.

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
actually there were a lot of big buy walls in it

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea that seems very bullish

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
they just shoved up a huge wall above what the price had been, over and over

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
How many KMD were in that candle?

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
then it got dumped all the way back down

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
500k?

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] Alecandro#1179
Jesus

[27-May-19 01:30 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, agree. I think the sellers will get burned one day, but for now they have the last laugh.

[27-May-19 01:31 AM] Alecandro#1179
Fa sho Fa sho

[27-May-19 01:31 AM] Alexfrog#1338
makes me sad that there are just that many people willing to dump kmd at 14k sats just because btc is rising

[27-May-19 01:31 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
It was the best way to purchase a whale size bag of coins on the quick.

[27-May-19 01:33 AM] Alecandro#1179
True dat. Well just remember alt season hasn‚Äôt even started yet soooooo

[27-May-19 01:33 AM] yorklab#7270
When big players buy like that, they're not in it to make a small profit, they normally expect big returns. Their timelines are usually much longer than the traders. So I figure I can wait as long as they can.

[27-May-19 01:33 AM] Alecandro#1179
Exactly

[27-May-19 01:35 AM] yorklab#7270
I keep thinking the sellers will run out of KMD sooner or later, but they seem to have an infinite supply.

[27-May-19 01:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah it makes no sense

[27-May-19 01:37 AM] Alexfrog#1338
didnt everyone who would dump low for btc because btc went up already do it in the previous 17 times btc went up?

[27-May-19 01:40 AM] yorklab#7270
Right? That's what I keep thinking. Especially now since Komodo seems so close to big thinks happening, you'd think most would want to hold for a little while to see how this all plays out. But I guess there are lots of traders out there buying and selling for every little satoshi they can get.

[27-May-19 01:42 AM] Alexfrog#1338
trader = traitor, fuck em.    hopefully every KMD is held by community who actually believes in it now after all this dumping

[27-May-19 01:43 AM] nocturnal#2177
i think midcaps are safe for a coupel of years

[27-May-19 01:43 AM] nocturnal#2177
then after that if theres no tangible use case its light out

[27-May-19 01:43 AM] nocturnal#2177
prob more like 4 years

I need 1kmd at $50

[27-May-19 04:58 AM] pinkolin#9557
Maybe alts season  must wait for non sense bitcoin price.

[27-May-19 04:59 AM] pinkolin#9557
Last time was start alt season with bitcoin price over $10k?

[27-May-19 04:59 AM] pinkolin#9557
Psychologic barier?

[27-May-19 05:01 AM] pinkolin#9557
Bitcoin is for too much money I will buy some cheaper coins?

[27-May-19 05:02 AM] pinkolin#9557
Alt season is about sentiment of weekend traders

[27-May-19 05:03 AM] pinkolin#9557
Something like crypto FOMO still don‚Äôt start.

[27-May-19 05:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
The time will come. BTC and ETH are both over capacity right now. As this circus ramps up this will start to be a serious problem. CEX's cant keep this thing running on just their databases forever.

[27-May-19 05:10 AM] LocoMB#8593
I hope that this time it will finally be about fundamentals such as use cases in the alts, not cheap sugry hype

[27-May-19 05:11 AM] LocoMB#8593
.. like  KMD@ 0.005 or 0.01 BTC

[27-May-19 05:11 AM] LocoMB#8593
cheap üç≠ üç≠ üç∞ sugary hype

[27-May-19 05:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
Who's to say that the exchanges aren't merely "hacking" themselves anyway? Oops, sold way more bitcoin than I actually have, hmmm.  "Sorry guys, I just got hacked"

It just means that the real value of crypto has not yet been discovered because it's so obfuscated by fraud and lies

[27-May-19 05:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
craptsy for sure was, and Quadriga too

[27-May-19 05:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yup

[27-May-19 05:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
maybe even the recent binance hack

[27-May-19 05:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
what happens to the price when a very large group of people who think they own crypto discover that  they don't own anything?

[27-May-19 05:22 AM] Alexfrog#1338
good question!

[27-May-19 05:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
in general, it goes down, as those people have to spend a long time buying back their own coins from the 'hacker'.  like in the 2014-2015 bear after MtGox went down

[27-May-19 05:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
mt gox times x? has usage scaled  10x, 100x?

[27-May-19 05:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
im glad KMD has the 5% reward for those who keep their own kmd in wallets, instead of storing it in exchanges.  reduces the amount of KMD on exchanges that can get hacked and dumped

[27-May-19 05:26 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i dont think any exchange hack ever again can ever be as big as MtGox was, they lost almost a million btc

[27-May-19 05:26 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no exchange in the future will have that many, they are just so much more spread out now

[27-May-19 05:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
I just mean active users. there are definitely more people invested now. Just hard to say how many more.

[27-May-19 05:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i think the %age of the total crypto that gets stolen is a better indicator of its impact than raw # of people

[27-May-19 05:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
well we have the blockchain to tell us how much btc has moved around. But we have to take the exchange at their word to tell us how many users are affected.  Just trying to anticipate what happens after the next mt gox. And what if has the opposite effect. When crypto becomes so ubiquitous it's necessary for day to day life. real scarcity shocks can have the same effect as a run on supplies at  the supermarket..

[27-May-19 05:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess it just illustrates the point that the power to manipulate currency supplies is a very lucrative and potentially destructive one.
