Bitcoin is just a tool to get the U.S.A out of its debt

[29-May-19 07:55 PM] Tek#5253

whaleburu might get some fill at 1750

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD always tries to inflict pain on its holders.   Usually by going down.  But if enough people just spent their KMD on ARRR, it can inflict pain by going up now 😄

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Tek#5253
expectations : whalbru gets filled at 1750

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Tek#5253
kmd tanks to 1680 after

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so basically every price with more than a few BTC on it, is whalebro?

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Tek#5253
(I buy here )

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yes

[29-May-19 08:03 PM] Tek#5253
whalebro wakes up and puts an order at 1750

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
anytime there is a wall of at least a few BTC on the buy its always whalebro 😄

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
no I know when its whalebro

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
he makes the same orders and patterns

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
always the same

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`KMD always tries to inflict pain on its holders.`
Maybe start trading instead of holding (or accept that holding is a long-term thing and short-term dips don't matter)

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
I think he's almost done accumulating too,

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253
lately the biggest orders were only 50btc

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone is stepping up the price with big buy orders

[29-May-19 08:04 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:06 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[29-May-19 08:06 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[29-May-19 08:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
0.00016*price of bitcoin = price

[29-May-19 08:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338
any day where KMD isnt down 10% is a pump

[29-May-19 08:08 PM] Alexfrog#1338

KMD ICO price - 12-13k sat, so in sat value we are +40%
Fiat 0.1 to 1.5 = 15x

[29-May-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
