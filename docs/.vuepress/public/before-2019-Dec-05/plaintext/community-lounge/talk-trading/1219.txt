We also might soon see some bullish crossovers
https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y860H52F/
green = 21 ma
yellow = 50 ma
turquoise = 200 ma

last time we had a golden cross (50 ma crossing 200 ma) we kinda went to the moon

Has anyone successfully deposited to Bilaxy? I am willing to take a small risk on sketchy exchanges, but I can't even seem to get a deposit address. I'm not sure I understand their angle... tons of fake volume of coins you can't deposit.. what's the point?

Bakkt has bitcoin bulls excited. 

Volume is growing exponentially. From a low base, but growing fast nonetheless.

But what makes Bakkt special for bulls is not its volume, but how many bitcoins are physically delivered.

In November, the number was 17 bitcoins. In Octobe...

Yep

@Lennart  [[800.000.000 x (1/777)] x 0.50 ] / 1.000.000 = 0,5148005148 Dex/day

[29-Nov-19 10:21 AM] costa2439#3771
I think it's right

[29-Nov-19 10:24 AM] Lennart#9331
that would mean you could live off 100 DEX in a small lifestyle.. at least in some places

[29-Nov-19 10:25 AM] Lennart#9331
and good thing would be that it's not even related to crypto prices.. only needs trading volume

Exactly, it's not linked to a coin, it's all of them

[29-Nov-19 10:29 AM] Lennart#9331
what do you think is a realistic trading volume for future Atomic Dex?

[29-Nov-19 10:31 AM] costa2439#3771

In the email just sent out it says the update goes live December 20th. Does this mean that deposits/withdrawals on binance will be closed until then?

no, they can update before that

[29-Nov-19 10:45 AM] Acura#2748
<jl777c> that is the activation date. the code is ready so i assume exchanges will start updating at anytime

What is DEX?

[29-Nov-19 12:23 PM] Lennart#9331
DEX receives revshare from trading fees from Atomic Dex

[29-Nov-19 12:24 PM] Lennart#9331
Atomic API to be precise, so also Hyperdex, Chainswap and all future apps running the market maker 2 (atomic api)

[29-Nov-19 12:25 PM] Lennart#9331
it's a coin with 1 mio supply

Does it work similar to the kmd rewards?

[29-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Lennart#9331
no

[29-Nov-19 12:55 PM] Lennart#9331
trading fees are collected in this address:  RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf

[29-Nov-19 12:56 PM] Lennart#9331
once the value of the assets held in this address reach 1 mio usd worth, every asset gets converted to KMD and then airdropped to DEX coin holders

[29-Nov-19 12:59 PM] Neko#5830
@hyperDEX do you want to buy or sell KMD

[29-Nov-19 01:04 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@Lennart so quite a while to go then?

[29-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Lennart#9331
yes. this address doesn't show BTC/BCH though, but still

[29-Nov-19 01:05 PM] Lennart#9331
well we're in beta

[29-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Lennart#9331
..and atm you can buy DEX for 20 KMD.. just saying

[29-Nov-19 01:06 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
To my dumb brain that seems like spending $20 to get back $1 later though?

[29-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Am I missing something

[29-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Lennart#9331
@Lennart  [[800.000.000 x (1/777)] x 0.50 ] / 1.000.000 = 0,5148005148 Dex/day

[29-Nov-19 01:07 PM] Lennart#9331
from above math, assuming 800.000.000 trading volume

[29-Nov-19 01:08 PM] Lennart#9331
now it's anybody's imagination, how big atomic api can become

[29-Nov-19 01:19 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Patrick Crypto every time 1mio is collected it is paid as dividend

[29-Nov-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Total trading volume per day is 64 billion today. Let's say, 1% is generated through atomicdex API, that means 64M volume daily. Of which 41184 is awarded to DEX holders, so every +-25 days you get a payout of 1usd per DEX you hold

[29-Nov-19 01:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
This doesnt take into account other uses for atomicdex API apart from trading, such as OTC trading, Mixing services using ARRR etc

[29-Nov-19 01:25 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
If I want to be crypto rich like KomodoWorld what should I buy:)
