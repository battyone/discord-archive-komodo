Just a thought on Komodo FUD. Barterdex has been a central point of the KMD/Supernet ecosystem and a central point of the argument for it's uniqueness, importance and validity, and it remains  on the website as a  key selling point to the technology.  But it doesn't work.  It is essentially unsupported since the electrum servers no longer work with it.  Anyone who hears about Komodo, then goes to the website to check it out, then downloads Barterdex will find it doesn't work and seems like it's no longer supported.  How exactly do you complain about people's FUD when the very thing that trumpeted as making our community and tech exceptional looks like a lie?

[28-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Deltazulu#2710
lol?

[28-Aug-18 03:41 AM] PTYX#6840
Hyperdex is replacing barterdex and it does work.

It's true that volumes are low but it works.

[28-Aug-18 03:55 AM] peritonlogon#7708
OK,  why stop supporting BarteDex (with electurm servers) while still promoting it on the website?  Why stop supporting it at all with the electrum servers?  It's on coinmarketcap.  There's no reason to discontinue the one that has brand recognition and many many links even if the other one was running full steam.  I've been an investor and a lurker in these forums for about 4 years now, I had a busy 4-5 months with work, came back and found  barterdex non-functional and everyone had switched to a different message site.  I'm a believer and found things not even working.   Imagine you've never heard of this, you follow a link, and everything looks good until that final mile when you try to run the software and....nothing.   If this last mile problem isn't rock solid, it doesn't matter who is hired for marketing, there will be unending bad press.

[28-Aug-18 03:57 AM] peritonlogon#7708
I'm no marketing guru, but I'm pretty good with common sense and finding the spots in my life where I'm being stupid.

[28-Aug-18 03:57 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I thought barterdex and hyperdex shared the exact same electrum servers

[28-Aug-18 03:58 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Am I wrong on this? I thought the front end GUI was the only difference between the two and they used the same engine atleast until MM2.0 with rust is going to be released

[28-Aug-18 04:02 AM] peritonlogon#7708
I can get Hyperdex to load, add non-native coins but not Barterdex  I get the .   Any coin I add as "electrum" I get the "could not connect to electrum server" blue pop-up and I cannot see a balance for the coins I have with those accounts, but I can with Hyperdex.

[28-Aug-18 04:05 AM] peritonlogon#7708
There's a reason why this https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/barterdex/ is $21 and a few months ago it was like $10K

Why do you think that the elecrum servers are discontinued?

[28-Aug-18 04:30 AM] PTYX#6840
The electrum servers work fine. In fact hyperdex works only on spv if I'm not mistaken

[28-Aug-18 04:30 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe you are on an old version of the old Barterdex. Try installing the latest version

Give him 1.x.x YouTube link

[28-Aug-18 05:07 AM] jspook16#3059
barterdex works (might take some getting used to but it does work).  Note that not all coins will have electrum servers but the most popular ones do.

[28-Aug-18 05:17 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i wonder if mm2.0 will make using barterdex as smooth as running a bittorent client

[28-Aug-18 05:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With one of the latest updates you had to remove and re-add all the coins

yeah the market maker 2.0 will fix few of the currently standing issues with the 1.0. Polishing technology to the level that it's usable by normal people without any issues takes some time. The MM2.0 got a dedicated devs working on it, so it will be ready in time üòÉ

I think the remittance market between Mexico/South America and the states has been shifting to crypto. maybe this new trade deal opened up some channels?

[28-Aug-18 09:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
likely it's just the btc peg to the dow. if the SEC ever sees fit to legitimize owning bitcoin without owning the private keys it hits 10k instantly
