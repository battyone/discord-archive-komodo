[18-Apr-19 10:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c so I would need to 51% attack to force other nodes to think my fake prices were correct?

[18-Apr-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
well it might be ugly, but it is the first trustless pricefeed that i know of

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you can mine all the blocks, as soon as you mine an invalid price the rest of nodes will reject it

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i was saying that your graphs were pretty, sorry that was not clear

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
how can you get nodes to accept a price that doesnt match all the nodes local prices?

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
this price feed stuff needs DPoW to be safe, it seems

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if ( minedprice not within 1% localprice) reject block

[18-Apr-19 10:07 AM] Markus#5464
what is the meaning of trace 0 to 3?

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Markus#5464
what do they stand for

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
0 is the mined prices

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
1 is the correlated price to eliminate the 2% price change attack

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c what if I have 99% nethash and censor blocks from all other miners, and slowly ramp up 1% constantly?

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
2 is the prev 24hr average

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
3 is 2 shifted back a day

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[18-Apr-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have 100% of hashrate

[18-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
as soon as the price you mine is more than 1% away from the local price, the node will reject it

[18-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
think of it like timestamps

[18-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it is using essentially the same mechanism

[18-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
you can submit a timestamp a bit in the future, a bit more from the past, but it needs to be reasonable or it will get rejected

[18-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so like a timestamp that is more than a minute from the future relative to system clock is rejected, a price that is more than 1% from local prices is rejected

[18-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter the hashrate, baked into the consensus

[18-Apr-19 10:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c what if I DoS all other nodes off the network, only leaving attacker nodes that all agree on prices?

[18-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but this +/-1% allows a 2% attack. ie,bias the price +1% and then bias the price -1%, for a 2% swing

[18-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
then it wont get notarized

[18-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and you are welcome to have a private chain with bogus prices, but how do you "double spend" or in this case make a bet payout when it shouldnt

[18-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
line 1 is a deterministic random data point from the prior day that has 51% correlation with the following data points

[18-Apr-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so this makes the 2% attack require 100% control over 2 days to conduct

[18-Apr-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
still possible, but much harder to control

[18-Apr-19 10:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
very fascinating stuff, i am sure this will interest some chains that want to do oracle-y stuff, maybe to migrate to an asset chain

[18-Apr-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i added -ac_prices=crypto, .... and -ac_stocks=stock, .... options to use the standard data source for binance cryptos and iex stocks

[18-Apr-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but a small source code fork and any data source can be used by an assetchain to make a trustless oracle from that data source

[18-Apr-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there are also the 32 forex currencies tracked by ECB

[18-Apr-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and once you have a trustless data source...

[18-Apr-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have CC use it as inputs

[18-Apr-19 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
interesting, so much potential

[18-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and i defined 2 new CC building on this that i think people will like a lot, especially traders

[18-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
not minute by minute day traders though, as the pricefeed is trustless but a day delayed

[18-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so we will be looking for beta testers who are experienced traders and can do unix commandline

[18-Apr-19 11:11 AM] Lumbi#8378
@jl777c is this oracle up for testing? this is what we need for what I call 'grenades' -- i.e contracts that perform specific trading operations automatically and transparently....

[18-Apr-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a blockchain, the trustless oracles use coinbase for the pricefeed

[18-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Lumbi#8378
so how would an -ac chain like LUMBER pull the data from the oracle?

[18-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_cbopret=7 -ac_prices="ETH, LINK" -ac_stock="AAPL, GOOG"

[18-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that would gather the basic prices plus ETH, LINK, AAPL and GOOG

[18-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then using prices rpc call you can get the most recent prices

[18-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add a getprice rpc call to get the price for any pricefeed as of any block

[18-Apr-19 11:25 AM] Lumbi#8378
is fiat USD, EUR, etc also to be found the same way? -ac_cbopret=7 ?

[18-Apr-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the ECB currencies are part of the basic prices, along with BTC and KMD

JUST IN: Coinbase brought in revenue of around $520 million in 2018, which is down nearly 44% year-over-year.

[18-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is probably why they are resorting to any trick in the book to make Coinbase shareholders happy

[18-Apr-19 11:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
another year with -44%, doesn't look good to the suits showing more expensive suits these bar charts

tell them they dont have to worry from the trustless oracles as that is only good for a limited subset of data types. they should more worry about oracles CC, which can replicate their data aggregation model

good thing HUSH has the Oracles CC enabled on our new mainnet, excited to play with it

[18-Apr-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
just add a custom data aggregation and it is like chainlink

[18-Apr-19 01:07 PM] klein#5233
get rekt coinbase

[18-Apr-19 01:17 PM] Malti#3948
500 mio in revenue with close to 250 mio profit doesn't seem to be rekt to me tbh

[18-Apr-19 01:19 PM] Malti#3948
I actually like coinbase for offering such an easy in into crypto

[18-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Ludom#5832
@infotech-al My opinion about Ethereum is that it's a very interesting project.

[18-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Ludom#5832
They made an important experimentation about turing complet smartcontracts

[18-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Ludom#5832
This experiment shows that's shit

[18-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's important to make this experimentation one time.

[18-Apr-19 01:34 PM] infotech-al#5583
i think all the experimentation is where the results come not from theory

[18-Apr-19 01:34 PM] infotech-al#5583
right so that being said

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Ludom#5832
But I don't think Ethereum model is the future

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Ludom#5832
To much problems

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Ludom#5832
- scalability

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] infotech-al#5583
they can iron out those issues,

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Ludom#5832
- Security of their art of smartcontract

[18-Apr-19 01:35 PM] gt#2812
theory and praxis are always in relation

[18-Apr-19 01:36 PM] infotech-al#5583
@gt yes not denying that, but experimentation is where the results are and I think ETH will continue to evolve

[18-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Ludom#5832
But price of a token or potential of a tech isn't correlated

[18-Apr-19 01:37 PM] infotech-al#5583
im not bullish or bear on it, i am trying to see if its worth me putting a little more money it and wait till next year on it

[18-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Ludom#5832
Certainly ETH will continue too evolve but the problem is a basic problem

[18-Apr-19 01:37 PM] infotech-al#5583
what is the basic problem?

[18-Apr-19 01:37 PM] infotech-al#5583
agree on tech vs price... we are seeing it with KMD

[18-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Ludom#5832
The security of smartcontracts how they propose it

[18-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
can ETH scale ?

[18-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ever ?

[18-Apr-19 01:39 PM] Ludom#5832
perhaps

[18-Apr-19 01:39 PM] infotech-al#5583
i really dont see why not

[18-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Ludom#5832
Because scalling should be a basic feature to be efficient, my two cents.

[18-Apr-19 01:40 PM] infotech-al#5583
agreed

[18-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Ludom#5832
It's very difficulte to implement "on the road"

[18-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's not impossible

[18-Apr-19 01:41 PM] infotech-al#5583
but thats my point, they will experiment and might even crash, but will keep moving fwd

[18-Apr-19 01:41 PM] infotech-al#5583
basically i m looking for someone to validate my idea of buying now and holding until it reachs $1k again! üòÉ

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes and we have to look at every experiment to make better decisions if possible

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] infotech-al#5583
you have convinced me, but some more ETH!

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] infotech-al#5583
üòÉ

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Ludom#5832
My opinion is that the best idea of investment right now is BTC

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Markus#5464
if ur in for the money then KMD got way more to offer in comparison to growth then ETH

[18-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Ludom#5832
For mid term
