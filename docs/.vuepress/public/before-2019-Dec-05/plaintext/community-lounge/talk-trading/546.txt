many investors believe that stocks that have already risen will not rise any further, and those that have not risen will naturally rise. but this is a long way from the truth. that certain shares have risen or fallen over the past few years is of no consequence in determining the current level of stock prices.

[15-Apr-19 08:13 AM] dokrates#8987
21k isn't enough?

[15-Apr-19 08:33 AM] Malti#3948
20400 would be great

shove 2 pizza pieces into each other and we know a bottom!

[15-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jorian#4555
how does the left part define a bottom. seriously

[15-Apr-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
by definition, the bottom cannot be known until well after it is formed

[15-Apr-19 12:18 PM] Sherdogz#6731
If btc takes a huge shit it's not going to be good

[15-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jorian#4555

bitcoin dominance bearish, pattern still in play. maybe BTC takes a shit and other cryptocurrencies get room to grow

[15-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jorian#4555
except KMD of course, because that would violate the number 1 KMD rule:

[15-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jorian#4555
if BTC goes up, KMD goes down
if BTC goes down, KMD goes down

[15-Apr-19 12:31 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Bitcoin goes sideways kmd goes sideways

[15-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jorian#4555
well it then actually goes up, right?

[15-Apr-19 12:46 PM] jorian#4555
KMD becomes a whale's toy when BTC is boring

[15-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It still is a good place to buy

[15-Apr-19 12:50 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
dont think it can extend much further

[15-Apr-19 12:51 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
daily did double touch of exactly 1980

gonna bounce from it? 2 times touched doesn't looks good

[15-Apr-19 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
it is the event horizon, must be defended

[15-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it is possible for it to not hold support should btc shit the bed and drop to 4k or so

[15-Apr-19 12:53 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
why so pesimistic

[15-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
sign of the bull

[15-Apr-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
i think it's called 'disbelief'

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] dokrates#8987
exactly

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not pessimistic

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
there is a possibility it happens

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just like there is one where btc rockets off to 60k üòÉ

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
i wouldn't mind buying some cheap kmd üòú

[15-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jorian#4555
it either goes up, down or sideways

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dokrates#8987
i just bought a bag the other day at 22k

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dokrates#8987

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
been acquiring bit by bit for a while now

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dokrates#8987
weeks waiting, and i did it wrong

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
y sad? r u expecting to buy a $30 mill mansion tomorrow?

[15-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dokrates#8987
hahaha

[15-Apr-19 12:56 PM] dokrates#8987
but i wanted to buy back in the best point

[15-Apr-19 12:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
fwiw in this bear market any point seems like the "best" point

[15-Apr-19 12:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's all down to the game you're playing

[15-Apr-19 01:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTC looks like it will have another sideways correction for some more time.

```how do you define how wide that circle is going to be?```
im not trying to define that... just think its the most probable thing to happen.

[15-Apr-19 01:26 PM] jorian#4555
@Tek why do you have Dash?

[15-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Tek#5253
most innovation happens there, proven security

[15-Apr-19 01:29 PM] Tek#5253
le what?

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
I had to pick a secure network to store value that isn't bitcoin, cause I really don't believe in BTC

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] Tek#5253
since blockstream

[15-Apr-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
other than masternodes, what has DASH innovated?

Mitigating 51% attacks with LLMQ-based ChainLocks
The recent controversies observed in other crypto projects have shown that threats of 51% mining attacks are real, at least in the sense‚Ä¶

[15-Apr-19 01:31 PM] Tek#5253
also, soon handles will be available

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Tek#5253
so you can send dash to @Tek instead of AEAEAEEANEN23

[15-Apr-19 01:32 PM] Tek#5253
bch has this too I think

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
yes let's bash Tek

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Tek#5253
the masternodes overlay solve the double spending

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
DASH has indeed done more than LTC

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Tek#5253
and also instant transactions

[15-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
masternodes makes it not very decentralized

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
especially as the majority of them might be controlled by related parties

[15-Apr-19 01:34 PM] Tek#5253
Maybe. but if you want bitcoin security, and instant transactions, you'll need a network to govern the chain

hahahah

[15-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo seems to achieve the same without having masternodes control the consensus

[15-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
@jl777c a masternode overlay appeals more to me than writing to the BTC chain, as I don't believe in it anyway

[15-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Tek#5253
self funding means dash has campaigns in failing countries

[15-Apr-19 01:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I wouldnt bash on dash

[15-Apr-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They have done a grear job establishing themselves in the market without being misleading or pump and dumpers

[15-Apr-19 01:38 PM] Tek#5253
@Deleted User you can work for the dash dao and obtain a masternode
