[15-Nov-18 04:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So if I understand correctly, ABC = VER + Jihan

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And SV = CSW?

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How is hash estimated?

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Unlimited = ?

[15-Nov-18 04:39 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Unlimited is neutral, has changed compatible with both SV and ABC

[15-Nov-18 04:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
countdowns are back!

[15-Nov-18 04:44 PM] modereck#4269
its done the fork?

[15-Nov-18 04:44 PM] snowdamn#2414

[15-Nov-18 04:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Something wants me to have jihan crush csw

[15-Nov-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
with all the smacktalk csw has been doing

[15-Nov-18 04:46 PM] snowdamn#2414
is what he's saying true is the real question

[15-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what do you think?.

[15-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
That he is satoshi

[15-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that his vision is the true vision

[15-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
etc

[15-Nov-18 04:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
no idea, will wait for him to release the Segwit stuff in 2019

[15-Nov-18 04:49 PM] snowdamn#2414
he's been tweeting about it
probably best to read his timeline

Well. In 2017 I said there was a MAJOR issue with SegWit.

In mid to late 2019, I will explain it.

It cannot be removed. It cannot be fixed. It is not solvable and, you cannot work around it.

Sorry. You allowed Core to kill BTC.

I did try and stop you.

since it uses anyone can spend mode as the hack to do the soft fork

BCH dump in 1 minute?

[15-Nov-18 04:56 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@snowdamn if that promise is as good as many previous ones, you can relax and forget about any 2019 reveal

[15-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Markus#5464
think BCH trading is paused on most exchanges so not much action will happen

[15-Nov-18 04:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
BCH was born to spoil all the fun in crypto
watch something good be happening around the time BCH idiocy hits in 2019

[15-Nov-18 04:58 PM] snowdamn#2414

rather Btiman vs casino guys

[15-Nov-18 05:21 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if I was making this war I would put significant amount of BCH on an exchange reporting to CMC and dumpy BSV or BSH (depending on side) right after fork

[15-Nov-18 05:21 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this would reuire very big amount on CEX

[15-Nov-18 05:21 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
economically it make no sense, but as demo of power

If that were the case then they would just take over btc, no?

BCH was THE split

[15-Nov-18 05:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
LoL   a lot of hashpower has come in aid of ABC

[15-Nov-18 05:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there's a possibility Faketoshi and Calvin get rekt completely

[15-Nov-18 05:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
where do you track hash?

[15-Nov-18 05:35 PM] snowdamn#2414

This extra 4 EH should shift the playing field in favor of ABC/BU.  

It would take more than the average electrical output of the Hoover dam's generator station to power 4 EH.  Roger just diverted an entire river.

[15-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can imagine the demand for hash has gone up significantly

[15-Nov-18 05:39 PM] WhiteWidow#8771
Should have been a bug or something because 4K Ph/s is almost impossible

not sure what are legal limitation of such "war" but if guys ready to burn millions I would expect they got some hackers group ready to hijack servers of oponents, switch of electricity in nearest tow and break down internet with spam bot networks or whatever

[15-Nov-18 05:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
usually you cant find these hackers anyway so they can go full power mode / if prepared
