@Mark81 yup, I agree with you

[04-Sep-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Caglio I just don't have trust in K64.

[04-Sep-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Both as a investor and as a developer, that project will never be a part of my portfolio.

[04-Sep-19 02:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
who is accusing who of mailing a bullet?

[04-Sep-19 02:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And these my individual's views. I don't care what the Komodo Platform thinks of K64.

[04-Sep-19 02:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I thought I was going to do some coding tonight...

[04-Sep-19 02:26 AM] Caglio#3337
@grewalsatinder yeah, its best to have opinions based on urself alone ( : , and yeah ur right

[04-Sep-19 02:27 AM] Caglio#3337
@dukeleto poor k64 guys, we are so harsh on them :( sigh sigh

[04-Sep-19 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't share my investors side of views, as I think I haven't achieved that level of success in this area  neither expertise. But it's my view to stay away from K64 ,even if the investment claims came as true. I don't trust this project will succeed even with millions of investments.

[04-Sep-19 02:31 AM] Caglio#3337
specially with millions of monopoly money

[04-Sep-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But even if they deliver some open source code to whatever extent may help 3rd party devs, to actually use it for something good.

[04-Sep-19 02:35 AM] Bitcoin Benny#9597
I, as you all know, remain quiet and prefer to speak about facts. I don‚Äôt complain and don‚Äôt explain. All I can say, is that they are serious allegations about someone we all work with. I for one put my head down and my bum up at all times, and I am firmly of the belief that you respond to what warrants responding to. I value my words so I always choose them very carefully. We have enough to focus on with the development of tech and with running the day to day. There is no time to become involved in such trivial matters, nor is there the need to divert any effort into addressing such matters.
We all have a job to do and we go back to what we have been doing well for an exceptionally long period of time. We focus on the right things and the things that matter. There is a saying used when navigating the Vietnamese traffic. ‚ÄúKeep your eyes on the road in front of you, and let the traffic behind you take care of itself‚Äù.

DYOR is how investors survive and get wealthy. A little bit of luck helps too.  KMD should not be in the asset promotion business, nor 'vetting', maligning, king-making or bottlenecking.  Problem solved. :5684_Peepo_Goteem:

@Bitcoin Benny who is the person with serious allegation ? Me as an investor of kmd and redfox have big sorrows

[04-Sep-19 06:08 AM] coingirl87#6489
And i dont understand the whole problem and situation! Can someone explain in some sentences what happened and why there is a big war between kmd k64 and redfox?

"@coingirl87 MrKomodoWorld has posted in the Komodo Discord and here in the main chat his views on this. Also the upcoming days there will be more news out that will not be in their favor either." Whats going on here???????

[04-Sep-19 06:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
What is wrong with kmd?

[04-Sep-19 06:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
Why the war?

[04-Sep-19 06:42 AM] LocoMB#8593
was the AMA in K64 discord?
these allegations do sound like a psychopath involved _somewhere_

[04-Sep-19 06:43 AM] coingirl87#6489
Maybe someone from team can say clear words what happened

[04-Sep-19 06:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes- this deserves clarifiaction

[04-Sep-19 06:44 AM] coingirl87#6489
I invested so much money in kmd and redfox because i trust you...

[04-Sep-19 06:44 AM] PTYX#6840
@coingirl87 probably best to wait for the team to devise a response. I see tons of allegations, little to no evidence, and only one person making noise.

[04-Sep-19 06:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
personally, I had to work with a narcissist for 9 months 20 years ago- that was _FUN_ - but the asshole easily could have brought the company down

[04-Sep-19 06:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
but didn't.. because narcississts and psychopaths are different brands of loony

[04-Sep-19 06:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
naricissists can do a lot of damage, but ultimately are bumbling idiots, and quite funny

[04-Sep-19 06:46 AM] LocoMB#8593
psychoptahs oth are really dangereous, and any responsible organization will expose and oust them

[04-Sep-19 06:48 AM] LocoMB#8593
anyone from the Komodo/ RedFoxLabs / K64 teams who reads this should take 1 or 2 hours and watch some youtube vids on these critters - 
if there is a psychopath involved, incidences like this _WILL_ continue

These are all signals of a quick market reversal. Always so, drama, accusations, scammers appear at the end of depression. I saw this before, for example, in the HUSH community at the end of 2017  @coingirl87

K64 appears to be an effort to disrupt the komodo. so far they make only statements, but never produce any results. if you give such things equal weight to people that have actually delivered results, then what to do. i still wait for any actual results from K64. until they produce something, they havent produced anything, other than drama

[04-Sep-19 07:43 AM] Tek#5253
obviously

I wouldn't go as far as scamming, but calling it conflicting interests...

[04-Sep-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
why to believe anything they say about komodo. they say they made a big investment in redfox. then later admit they never made any payment (after many months delays)

[04-Sep-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you see the pattern? announce something, then make excuses for delays.

i even heard from people who asked me how much i invested in K64. it seems claims are being made that i invested. i invested 0, some coins i was given for free. i dont feel right to sell them to people so i still have them

[04-Sep-19 07:49 AM] coingirl87#6489
So you  think k64 is scam? 

Sorry but i dont know who is saying the truth...fact is that there was a big kmd hack and k64 knows more about it and who was it. It seems bitcoin benny is involved and komodo team knows more than investors and community knows at the moment . We only want clear facts

[04-Sep-19 07:49 AM] Tek#5253
i really don't care and don't know about anything of these matters

[04-Sep-19 07:49 AM] Tek#5253
but yea K64 is probably a money grab

[04-Sep-19 07:50 AM] Tek#5253
I just watch KMD. the rest is all baby tier basement people projects.

[04-Sep-19 07:50 AM] Tek#5253
the chance they are serious is low the chance that they succeed is low

[04-Sep-19 07:50 AM] Tek#5253
its about risk reward right

[04-Sep-19 07:50 AM] coingirl87#6489
Why you think so?

[04-Sep-19 07:51 AM] Tek#5253
been in the space for a while now. KMD ecosystem is a mirror of ETH ecosystem

[04-Sep-19 07:51 AM] Tek#5253
99% of projects are shit and will fail

[04-Sep-19 07:51 AM] Tek#5253
just money grabs

[04-Sep-19 07:51 AM] Tek#5253
outright scams

[04-Sep-19 07:51 AM] Tek#5253
etc

[04-Sep-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if K64 knows more about the hack, it could only be because they did it. so i doubt they know anything more than we do

[04-Sep-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
K64 is making baseless accusations to create disruption

[04-Sep-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the claims that K64 raised 78 million at a 1.3 billion valuation, based on no existing history. this is an incredible claim and without clear proof, it cannot be believed. also, if they have so much funds, why do they have a hard time paying people? anyway, many have claimed i am a scam, and worse. why do they do this?

[04-Sep-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
what part of the kmd-transparency is no very good? did you really read it? keep in mind it is written with some sour grapes

[04-Sep-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but the general concept that an outsider without any prior connections or money was able to become an NN operator, this is so horrible?

[04-Sep-19 08:20 AM] rainbro7#4735
No, that is good for decentralization.

[04-Sep-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
apparently, i made one or more decisions that dwy didnt agree with, so there is a "governance" problem.

[04-Sep-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is for issues that dont affect chain consensus, my view is that it was within my rights to decide, so i did

[04-Sep-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
without invoking some public governance process that would have low turnout to have people who dont understand the technical issues to decide

[04-Sep-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
NN are elected and once elected they need to work together as a team. they get 75% of blocks, so i decided that they should also get 75% of blockrewards

[04-Sep-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
THAT is the big controversy

[04-Sep-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
that 75% of blocks should be roughly 75% of the total mining rewards. it wasnt, so we took action to correct it

[04-Sep-19 08:26 AM] jansako#3330
The trouble seems to be with the fact that there is a conflict between the 'open and decentralized' nature of KMD and the need to make executive decisions that by nature require a hierarchy (corporate--like or otherwise). Without clearly communicated internal rules it becomes confusing for people on the inside, then add the (lack of) face to face cooperation and collaboration that exists in this space.  Then people bring in their ideas of 'what should be' instead of the clearly articulated 'what is'.

[04-Sep-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
that is not what happened with dwy

[04-Sep-19 08:27 AM] jansako#3330
this is not only about DWY

[04-Sep-19 08:27 AM] jansako#3330
dwy is a symptom

[04-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Alexfrog#1338
dwy's post seems to be upset about NNs that were stealing extra block rewards due to undermining, and then to being personally attacked recently.  
i think making sure only 75% of block rewards are getting distributed to NNs is a good idea, what problem did dwy have with this?

[04-Sep-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
60 other NN are not having any problems with this

[04-Sep-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
with K64, we are just saying that we dont make any endorsement for them and for you to do your own research. when they are making character assasination attacks, we need to state that it is false info

[04-Sep-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alexfrog when you personally attack people, their natural response is to attack back. calling a technically oriented person they are incapable of understanding something... that is a trigger
