bull whales have been doing $200 crash preventions

[07-Dec-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
usually was 3700

[07-Dec-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but they waited this time until 3200

[07-Dec-18 07:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
3500 is resistance now

i like all those articles out there about prices predictions, some ppl believe it will go to 398$

[07-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Markus#5464
pretty interesting how they come up with exactly 398

[07-Dec-18 07:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
this is the closest i've gotten to a liquidation without getting kicked
i'm letting this one ride until $1M lol

[07-Dec-18 07:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
so what do we make of this big green candle?  Daily volume is notably higher in the last few days...

[07-Dec-18 08:00 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
nothing, we haven't reached 200weekly ma yet

[07-Dec-18 08:00 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
next technical bottom is at 2700

[07-Dec-18 08:01 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
previous resistance, should be new support, had high vlume at these levels, like 3-4 times of what we have in the current range.

[07-Dec-18 08:02 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Ideally, dip below, short squeeze back up and close at least a daily above that, better yet a weekly. Then sideways for months into new bullrun

[07-Dec-18 08:03 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
If we are lucky, the sideways will be 1-2 monthy only. december/january are usually low volume and price dips down historically in that time

[07-Dec-18 08:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
After that next target I see is 2200, which was monthl candle close prior to exponential bull run in 2017

[07-Dec-18 08:05 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
all very similar to 2014

Right on, @bpkdasbaum .  Thanks!

[07-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I buy more?

[07-Dec-18 08:15 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
worst case scenario we go a little bit below 1000. That's tinfoil hat territory though with banks and bad actors dumping the price on exchanges to get in cheaper on OTC markets and also steal coins from fearful retail.

I check 4chan and reddit threads to check the sentiment, full capitulation hasn't set it yet, suicide prevention is not spread yet.

```bpkdasbaum: nothing, we haven't reached 200weekly ma yet``` this is what i hear a lot too

[07-Dec-18 08:23 PM] jorian#4555
and that level is below 3k
