I really do hope that PIRATE continues to be traded with KMD which will raise the demand for the KMD coin.

[27-Sep-18 01:18 PM] snowdamn#2414
well, not worth looking into it if it breaks privacy really
just make sure you have actual hackers setting up tortuga
tortuga should be set up using very high standards IMHO

[27-Sep-18 01:19 PM] snowdamn#2414
or not at all

[27-Sep-18 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

It seems 0.1 KMD is too much for now (or people don't want to buy from me!). No matter. I hold my PIRATE for now and perhaps I'll sell at a higher price within a few hours 😉
