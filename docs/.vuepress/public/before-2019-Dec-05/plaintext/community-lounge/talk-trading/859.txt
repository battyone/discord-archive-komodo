and with the shorts in panic cover mode these numbers gets skewed even more

[26-Jun-19 04:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
So is it reasonable to assume some whales might like to sell hard and trigger a little crash back down?

[26-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Markus#5464
it will happen sooner or later

[26-Jun-19 04:55 PM] bishop#9773
13500ish is the 61.8% fib using cbase

Bitcoin is one of the scarcest assets in the world and eventually every human will want one.

the technicals dont matter as much when there is a panic...after 2 gaps higher and a parabolic chart im waiting for an exhaustion candle.

[26-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Markus#5464
the worst is that parabolic rises tend to correct 80%

[26-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Markus#5464
wow it keeps going

[26-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Tek#5253
any resistance just gets absolutely destroyed

The orderbooks are a little insane right now. 

On Coinbase, a $27M market sell will crash Bitcoin to 10k from 12.5k. 

A $27M market buy will send Bitcoin to 10k from 19k.

alts just dont have the liquidity to absorb a burst dam

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] dan.#2473
Will it? It's happened a few times, but this is a pretty insane capitulation if so

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
only choice is to go up by crazy percentage

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
holding a fiat peg +/-, this is not much of a capitulation

[26-Jun-19 05:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and volumes are not so big either

[26-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
also look at the sellside depth on the orderbooks

[26-Jun-19 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
does that look like a disorderly stampede to the exit?
