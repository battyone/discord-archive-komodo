Would be so paranoid, or you have it in a address and you forgot where you hid the priv key lol

[06-Sep-19 10:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[06-Sep-19 10:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But how do you know it exists 😄

[06-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Oszy#5734
i am sure it would make the news 😄

[06-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Oszy#5734
would you shut up about it if you'd mess up big time? 😄

[06-Sep-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a catch 22

[06-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Oszy#5734
yea cus if you tell someone might get it

[06-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Oszy#5734
but if you dont u donet have a chance of getting it back

[06-Sep-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586

it also consolidated a lot of dust  -> maybe tracking utxos

[06-Sep-19 10:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586

bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2076717.0      one of the addresses

[06-Sep-19 10:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Here is a question for everyone.

Which one would be at risk of personal safety issues?

1. 100M in Crypto
2. 100M in the bank
3. 100M in assets

[06-Sep-19 10:45 AM] CHMEX#0686
2 ...

[06-Sep-19 10:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why 2?

[06-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Tek#5253
bank and assets

[06-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Tek#5253
no wait

[06-Sep-19 10:45 AM] Tek#5253
bank

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all if you have a big mouth

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
2) because they know who you are

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If someone knew you had 100M in crypto, they could think that you are a easy target

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] sφldat#8733
Société générale invests 15M€ in Btc in 2016 and keeps holding.

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] Tek#5253
you have to put the euro sign before the value

[06-Sep-19 10:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
>>If someone knew you had 100M in crypto, they could think that you are a easy target
yss that true same with assets but only with a bank you have todo kyc

[06-Sep-19 10:47 AM] sφldat#8733
Oh U right :)

[06-Sep-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But you see billionaire  walking around in the US

[06-Sep-19 10:47 AM] Tek#5253
we are we pumpin

[06-Sep-19 10:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I find it interesting say a crypto billionaire  would be more at risk than a normal billionaire

[06-Sep-19 10:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes that's true... maybe also depends in which coutry you are

[06-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253
>> they don't know

[06-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Tek#5253

[06-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Tek#5253

[06-Sep-19 10:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[06-Sep-19 10:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[06-Sep-19 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[06-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253

[06-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[06-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Tek#5253

[06-Sep-19 10:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
