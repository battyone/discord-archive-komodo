HSH for the whale incoming or what? he gonna snack it up again on 18500

[21-Oct-18 10:23 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
this is a really weird feeling. just from knowing that the whale was there for the last days, all usual TA is thrown in question. I am pretty sure there are lots of traders wanting to sell based on what the chart says, but there is the fear that you'll just sell into the whale and that he pumps it soonish. dem mindgames

[21-Oct-18 10:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

there is hidden divergence in his suggestion, while it may sound like a helpful advice, it's also a passive aggressive  critique, only perhaps though üòõ

lolwat ^^?

[22-Oct-18 01:13 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
how do you get everyone to give their coins away for betting? how do you redistribute?

[22-Oct-18 01:13 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
whata bout lost coins

[22-Oct-18 01:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its a game.

[22-Oct-18 01:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Luck will redistribute (probability)

[22-Oct-18 01:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
lost coins? no one except the owner of the coin is responsible for lost coins (dont get this part).

[22-Oct-18 01:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i should buy one too

[22-Oct-18 01:16 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Maybe i don't undertstand the game. But it says it's only unlocked if the mined coins are bet against the locked coins? If I mine a block and lose my key or decide to never bet, noone ever will be able to unlock the other 50%?

[22-Oct-18 01:17 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
well... i you lose your coins and lets say 1% of coins get mined and lost then the odds will be 50:49

[22-Oct-18 01:18 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
lawl

[22-Oct-18 01:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the 50% might stay locked forever... maybe eventually all coins will get locked, maybe someone hits thejack pot and win 1.5million coins which is the biggest possible prize

[22-Oct-18 01:18 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we dont know what will happen, and that is the cool part.

[22-Oct-18 01:19 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
transaction fees will bring down the chance as well right?

[22-Oct-18 01:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not exactly.. why?

[22-Oct-18 01:22 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
It's on a 1:1 bet coin ratio right? If i bet 50 coins, each coin has a chance to roll?

[22-Oct-18 01:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
txfees dont get locked

[22-Oct-18 01:22 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
oh wait, right, fees go to miners, and they can roll

[22-Oct-18 01:22 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you can bet on any odds from 1 :1 to 1500:1

[22-Oct-18 01:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
max possible bet is 1000KMDICE at 1500:1

[22-Oct-18 01:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that will give you a possible prize of 1.5million coins

[22-Oct-18 01:23 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
smallest possible bet is 0.001 at 1:1

[22-Oct-18 01:24 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Need those rules and info in the thread please :3

[22-Oct-18 01:26 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
wait, can't you simply double your bet each time you lose?

the mimium odds is actually 3:1 .. because if you win you get 2x + what yo ubet

[22-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
over enough bets

[22-Oct-18 01:27 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
in roulette the house will give you a max limit on doubling down.

[22-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all the coins will end up inthe contract

[22-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181

maybe, maybe not :trollface:

[22-Oct-18 01:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and doesnt bet again

[22-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then it wont... but my guess is they would sell them

[22-Oct-18 01:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they would end up back in the contract
