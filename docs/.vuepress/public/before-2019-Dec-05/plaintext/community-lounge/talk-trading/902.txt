[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
buy at 10k, sell at 16k, buy again at 10k ... rinse and repeat

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[08-Jul-19 12:18 PM] dxer666#8963
@siu - Chainmakers  amazing

[08-Jul-19 12:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[08-Jul-19 12:48 PM] Sherdogz#6731
ðŸ˜„ Maybe you should set buy order from 5k to 12k to be sure

[08-Jul-19 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
nah 12k is too high

[08-Jul-19 12:48 PM] Tek#5253
I need to be sure I buy the bottom or don't buy at all

[08-Jul-19 12:48 PM] Tek#5253

[08-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253

[08-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
at some point

[08-Jul-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
maybe I should put it even lower

This Crypto Shot Up 165% Since January in a Breakout That Just Won...
Komodo has recently seen a huge price surge of 75% in two weeks. This crypto is now retracting and is a good buy on dip candidate.

Smh btc laughing at any alts "main net" or "rebrand" every time without fail. Hopefully KMD establishes itself with this move for realz

KMD is a troll coin.  It will never moon because everyone that owns it sells every pop

[08-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Malti#3948
I tend to agree to a certain extent. People want KMD to be in top 20 soon, but sell whenever it makes an upward movement. Of course this makes sense from a trading POV, but it doesn't help general price movement

[08-Jul-19 03:30 PM] Malti#3948
but KMD is not a troll coin

[08-Jul-19 03:31 PM] JimD#9272
Maybe "trolled coin" would be more accurate

[08-Jul-19 03:31 PM] JimD#9272
its been moving up pretty well for the last couple months though

[08-Jul-19 03:31 PM] Malti#3948
and maintaining that 50 spot on CMC during a very long time is quite the achievement as jl said

[08-Jul-19 03:33 PM] JimD#9272
Yup, the tech and approach of KMD is very good so I think as the garbage gets weeded out of the top 100 KMD should rise

[08-Jul-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
one thing i noticed that is different with this big rise and following "correction" is that the volume is still relatively high. usually when it drops back down, the volume really goes down. not sure what that means

[08-Jul-19 04:48 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea that is interesting.... hmmm whatâ€™s your speculation @jl777c
