pump up the turkisch marketing :0) 
If you have any accounts at Turkish banks now would be the time to empty them. go KMD

[13-Aug-18 10:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think there are already capital restrictions in place

[13-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So probably already very difficult to withdraw TRY

Eth is getting rekt. All those ICOs are scared and selling their holdings.

[13-Aug-18 04:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I actually saw an overview that most ICO's are still holding strong

[13-Aug-18 04:34 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Too bad they are not rewarded for holding. If only they had went with komodo, when it was around during their ICO of course.

[13-Aug-18 04:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362

I mean what exactly have 99% of Erc20 projects actually spent those millions on? websites? Paid tweets / articles? Do any have actual working products before they got rekt haha

[13-Aug-18 04:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
bancor maybe? any more ?

[13-Aug-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
paid placements are very expensive if you do a lot as are exchange listings

[13-Aug-18 04:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
1 x exchange listing $100k 
10 x paid coindesk articles $50k
50 x crypto twittwr OG shills $50k 
Dropping 1mill % in value to never return priceless

days of $100K exchange listings (for top ones) are over

[13-Aug-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
try $1mil+

[13-Aug-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
basically the ICO turns out to be a money transfer to exchanges for the most part

[13-Aug-18 05:00 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i remember seeing something along those lines a while back. Never understood it tbh. It should be the other way round. End of day decent project attracts decent trade and that brings $ for the exchanges. Ppl becoming impatient and buying a token for an exchange listing price increase has caused this.

it's interesting on Eth reddit there is no important price thread  price dropped like 5 times since ATH ...

BTC domination 52% right now

[13-Aug-18 07:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as it rises, crypto winter continues

[13-Aug-18 07:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
my bet is 2-3 months of winter season with up's up to 8k and downs to 5k, maybe lowest 3-4k, but let's see

[13-Aug-18 07:49 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this week we could see some 5.5k and then maybe rebounce to 7.5k next week

[13-Aug-18 07:49 PM] bishop#9773
I keep Mr. KMD locked in a dark basement. Which reminds me, I have to go down there and beat him some more.

[13-Aug-18 07:50 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I'm only worried after the 2-3 months winter season we can get the global IT financia bubble break... Facebook already got the biggest drop in history lately... some about 130 billions $ ?

[13-Aug-18 07:51 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sooner or later social-media owners will get the real data that you can't fool people with same marketing online endlessly and make money out of thin air like that, other social media will drop too

[13-Aug-18 07:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's will also be a potential for crypto as alternative new IT bubble, but only if global USD crisis will not kill the normal business like car, vegetables and chicken productions 😃

[13-Aug-18 07:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
hope it will not happen too soon

[13-Aug-18 07:54 PM] bishop#9773
...well, to be fair, the drop in FB just put it back into the range it was a few months prior when Zuck was getting heat during the senate hearing

[13-Aug-18 07:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@bishop  look from the perspective of money vaporizing 😃 if 130 billions $ can simply disappear then think of a panic or other impacts that might happen if this happen also in other companies

[13-Aug-18 07:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sooner or later on big waves like that people will start thinking it's not real and could panic sell

[13-Aug-18 07:58 PM] bishop#9773
It shouldn't surprise anyone 9 years into a bull market run held entirely on the back of easy money policy

[13-Aug-18 07:58 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
value purely virtual

[13-Aug-18 07:59 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if it would not surprise anybody then ther ewould be no crisis and also no bull market, just steady slow growth

[13-Aug-18 08:00 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
financial system is non-linear ?unstable? system based on many unpredictable variables, no one really knows when it breaks

[13-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Reel Em In#1495
another ATL vs the $ for KMD since being listed on binnance.

[13-Aug-18 08:01 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
and as I read newspapers - analystd always tend to think "ok there are some indicators, BUT THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT" 😃

[13-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont forget that the btc and stock markets are generally moving in the same direction

[13-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So if you hope that when the stock or debt bubble bursts some of that money will flow into crypto think again 😃

[13-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe after a while, but expect it all the go to shit together first

[13-Aug-18 08:04 PM] bishop#9773
Hardly a worthwhile conclusion... BTC and crypto broadly has only had to experience a bull market, across markets

[13-Aug-18 08:04 PM] bishop#9773
...but as with most asset classes, things tend to increase in correlation during down markets. Will be interesting nonetheless

[13-Aug-18 08:11 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Cryptoon  I think more in the next global financial market bull run crypto will replace social media bubble. Crypto space is part of not official IT financial market so yes, I expect it down with global trends. Just I hope I will have some time to convert some BTC to gold 😛 before global hits the low

[13-Aug-18 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@bishop january stock market highs also coincided with crypto market highs though :p

1000 employees at a single company and yet there are only two DApps with (barely) over a thousand active users across the Ethereum ecosystem. If ever there was a proof case for “you’re doing it wrong” this is it.
