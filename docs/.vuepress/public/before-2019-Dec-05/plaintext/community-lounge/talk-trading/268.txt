@actionslacks best trading tip ever. I feel the same. No one has a clue. All you can do is sift the wheat from the chaff and HODL it.

i usually only buy and keep them for some years

[09-Nov-18 10:21 AM] dokrates#8987
that is the reason i wait long until i find the bottom

[09-Nov-18 10:21 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Spreading some kmd over pirate and verus would be a good addition as these are relativley new amd ground floor

[09-Nov-18 10:22 AM] dokrates#8987

BRILLIANT thread. 👌

Bankers/regulators are very familiar with BTC/crypto, but not concerned AT ALL - they know they can ban/regulate it anytime.

We're not in a cypherpunk novel. We need to lobby + use public pressure (demand our rights); that's the only way for crypto...

@dokrates Down to 18.5k from 20k is no big deal.  I remember buying a bit at 50k, I’ve learned since 😂

[09-Nov-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Down to 18.5k from 20k is no big deal.`
_wonders how down 1.5k is "no big deal" yet almost everyone in this channel lost their shit with excitement when it went **up** that 1.5k_

[09-Nov-18 02:58 PM] grumpygoron#4320
I wasn’t excited 😂 we won’t go up with fantasy timelines of delivery from the marketing team.  No actual hard dates set means we’re in the same boat we were a year ago with the “wait and see eventually” approach

[09-Nov-18 02:58 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Which led to a six month dico delay with a last minute cancellation

No, a year ago the price was 2x

Not sure news makes any diff in a bear market either

[09-Nov-18 02:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it would be a waste ... need at least a turn to bulish before announcing huge things

[09-Nov-18 02:59 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 don’t remind me 😂

[09-Nov-18 03:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
timing is everything

[09-Nov-18 03:01 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@blackjok3r that’s why no other coins are announcing developments or updates

[09-Nov-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
We are making plenty ... and there is announcments and blogs and things for people who care to look

[09-Nov-18 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no pooint making 1 milltion tps in this market though lol

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
other things more important

[09-Nov-18 03:02 PM] grumpygoron#4320
But it’s the marketing team’s role to get those in front of people instead of just letting our loyal followers research themselves.

[09-Nov-18 03:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well I guess so... im not on the marekting team... I just keep trying to solve probelems or make things that seems useful... Find attack vector fix it ...

[09-Nov-18 03:04 PM] grumpygoron#4320
As you should.  But we’ve had this new marketing agency for nearly two full quarters now and still at a planning stage.  I’m a director for a marketing agency, no client would allow for that long of a planning stage without any execution

and crypto moves a bit faster than traditional businesses.  Time is one of the most important resources, IMO, in this rapidly maturing sector

[09-Nov-18 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
havent been updateing this as much as I should be : https://trello.com/b/bH38cFbu/stakeddev

But the amount of things #kmdlabs  is getting done in a very short amount of time, is still blowing my mind... A year ago, I knew almost zero about blockchains or codeing. definatly been taking up all of my time, all waking hours ... Guess marketing needs to work that hard somehow :trollface:

Organize anything, together. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, know what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

[09-Nov-18 03:17 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@meatspoon exactly why this relaxed approach to marketing makes no sense to me.  And yes @blackjok3r that’s my point exactly!  I love the developments but none of it gets translated to making it public.  I imagine Komodo got sold on a “Coca-cola..Nike..Apple..KOMODO” presentation and they’ve been kicking back since winning the contract

[09-Nov-18 03:19 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Too many marketing agencies do that to customers.  The marketing channel is more filled with “hey community, send us your ideas” rather than “we had this idea to help improve our presence in the crypto space, check it out”

[09-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well to be fair, 90% of my work is toal experiments.... msot of it will never make it to KMD I wouldnt think... maybe it will maybe it wont ... but the best and most useful things do... and our project is al about making ideas reality using KMD tech... I think the things that will come from that, actualy useful apps, will do more than any marektking can.

[09-Nov-18 03:20 PM] grumpygoron#4320
There is a graveyard of great ideas throughout history that never saw the light of day that would debate that lol

[09-Nov-18 03:21 PM] blackjok3r#3181
get devs, build products ... get people to use them ... dont see how it cna fail myself... but I know nothing about marketing tbh

[09-Nov-18 03:22 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Well marketing is my wheelhouse, that’s why I criticize.  And in a space where everything is about presence and awareness it’s extremely important.

With the bear market going on, I think time is better spent on planning so Marketing is ready for a big push when everything starts to move up again. As It was stated earlier, timing is everything. Big announcements right now probably wouldn't do much for Komodo or KMD.

a year ago the price probably would have immediately gone 500-1000%

[09-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Sdunbar#5064
now it went up 10-15% then slid right back down

[09-Nov-18 04:32 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I mean obviously his rep has been severely tarnished over the last year but it still shows how little effect things have on the market price right now

The other is a more serious vulnerability that has been confirmed but cannot be announced immediately, because it can be exploited by hackers that lead to significant damages.

@yorklab so you think it’s best to wait until the market is busy to grow awareness rather than when things are calm?  Now is when we can catch peoples attention so when the bullish market starts their first thought is Komodo.  By your logic we will be trying to gain attention later when eyes are elsewhere.  When things are calm is precisely when we should be attacking.

@grumpygoron  I agree 100% with u and I have been retweeting almost every single tweet the team puts out hope it getting to some people

[10-Nov-18 01:51 AM] yorklab#7270
@grumpygoron If something is ready, then yes, market it; let the world know, I agree. "Planning" doesn't mean marketing team is doing nothing. I just think it may be best to wait for various projects to be finished first, like MM 2.0 for HyperDex/Barterdex and new wallet by IBN, etc., before spending a lot of money marketing to the masses.

[10-Nov-18 06:52 AM] ryman112#0068
@grumpygoron grum I agree with you.  Nows the time not when everything is going crazy again.  I would love to see any marketing thats beyond our little group lol.  But maybe they have a kickass strategy that will blow all other marketing strategies away like all their tech.  Maybe their marketing isn't polished or ready yet.  At least they have marketed their marketing.  Hopefully something comes from that sooner than later.
