no idea about the medium term future. my recent predictions were spot on, only because i saw the repeating whale stair pattern

[18-May-19 04:44 PM] jl777c#5810
probably there isnt even any TA term for that

[18-May-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, if you dont have a long position in BTC and are dying to establish a long position to capture the bull market, pick some altcoins that are close to their bear market lows

[18-May-19 04:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
buy vbk

[18-May-19 04:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

that is a much safer bet, as the BTC dominance going back to 45%, that alone should double such

[18-May-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
I think Litecoin could  see price action now before halvening

[18-May-19 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
when BTC dominance goes from 58% to 45%, basically all alts will do well

[18-May-19 07:43 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
What about when KMD dominance surpasses BTC dominance

[18-May-19 07:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[18-May-19 07:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Price dominance and hashrate dominance aren‚Äôt the same thing

[18-May-19 08:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
One typically follows the other

[18-May-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
what should I buy?

[18-May-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
I rode ETH up and now I'm in BCH

[18-May-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
which is staying stable against BTC around 0.05 for now

[18-May-19 08:38 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Beats me?

Don‚Äôt let fishy hear you say that @Tek  you might get keelhauled :realpirate:

[18-May-19 09:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Tek if you class 3k+ users that we know of and a hedge fund 'no one' you must be really rubbing shoulders with them paid group crypto influencers in the distributed ledger technology industry and other bs buzzwords

[18-May-19 09:40 PM] Tek#5253
3k users lmao

[18-May-19 09:40 PM] mrlynch#5735

[18-May-19 10:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@allbits that‚Äôs right, I guess it was the Nxt slack

[18-May-19 10:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Supernet was a big part of it

[18-May-19 10:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Too long ago :abusedsmily:

[18-May-19 10:09 PM] allbits#5898
It was before anyone started using slack

[18-May-19 10:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I distinctly remember the initial chatter on whatever slack it was

[18-May-19 10:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Supernet, Nxt or otherwise

[18-May-19 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
@Tek ARRR has a better anonymity set than any other coin, wouldn't consider that useless

[18-May-19 10:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
ARRR is good enough to be banned by governments, watch

Wen hollowcoin? I made an assetchain the other day and it was kinda fun. You should try it.

[18-May-19 10:20 PM] allbits#5898
Hey @tek there are currently 728 pirate nodes, more than many top 100 coins. Are you so sure you're not regret having heard about this when it was close to the ground floor?

[18-May-19 10:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
ARRR!! The space pirates that Ted Cruz is dreading confronting.
