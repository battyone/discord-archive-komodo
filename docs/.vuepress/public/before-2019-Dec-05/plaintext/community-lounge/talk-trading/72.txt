Meet the 'Sovereign': Marshall Islands Government to Issue Crypto ...
The tiny Republic of the Marshall Islands plans to sell a cryptocurrency, known as the Sovereign, to supplement the U.S. dollar as its legal tender.

holy sh.... bitcoin dumping and out of pure coincidence there where 200BTC at around  $7950 on Binance
God damn market manipulators and bots who selling for every sh... price out there.

[30-Jul-18 05:57 PM] ryman112#0068
Everything seems to be going red.  What happened did I miss something?

[30-Jul-18 05:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Imagine that, BTC can't hold the illogical 2 day 25% increase and is seeking a level...

[30-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I wouldnt worry as long as we stay above 7800ish

[30-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
it makes me so sick watching the trading history at Binance, don¬¥t know why I still do it. The bots are selling as if Bitcoin was hacked. I would so much take them their little toy away. They simply can¬¥t get enough

[30-Jul-18 06:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_wonders if it's the drugs @Hagen-von-Coinje is on or the drugs that Hagen-von-Coinje should be on that makes Hagen-von-Coinje so emotionally invested in how/why/when someone else's bots trade/exist ü§î_

[30-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As long as in the long run it goes up i wouldnt worry too much about it

_personally hopes BTC goes to 12 cents and finally dies the fiery death that it should_

[30-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
I don¬¥t even have 1 BTC at the moment, thats not the point. They are killing the market again and again. No project/coin will work with such priceswings

[30-Jul-18 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, you're emotionally invested in a market that you're not even a participant in?
Does your doctor know you've escaped?

[30-Jul-18 06:14 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
what the hell are you talking about? Oh I see your KMD is rising bigtime at the moment, thats great. But strangly all my coins need a new word for rekt at the moment. I don¬¥t have panic about losing all, I will not sell one KMD at the moment but don¬¥t you see that this big priceswings are crazy? If you like that then be happy, I¬¥m not

[30-Jul-18 06:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Oh I see your KMD is rising bigtime at the moment, thats great. But strangly all my coins need a new word for rekt at the moment.`
Don't invest in shitcoins?

[30-Jul-18 06:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and as far as *my* KMD, it's down a pseduo of $0.50

[30-Jul-18 06:19 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
my KMD, Elastos, VeChain are holding me over water, also Neo and ETC

[30-Jul-18 06:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's all about what you do, when you do it, and for how long you do it
Short of 4 times buying in BTC dips that weren't dips (and even then I made it back later), I've yet to loose $ on a single investment
But, then again, I'm in it for the long haul, not day trading

[30-Jul-18 06:24 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
KMD is also down from 13$ high. was lucky with that and started buying at around 2,50 and 1,60

[30-Jul-18 06:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`KMD is also down from 13$ high. `
It was an irrational peek based on nothing more than dinks feeling good because BTC was at an irrational peek; so, it's a pointless number to even mention

I don¬¥t know how long you are this space, me only 1 year, so what happend in dec2017 was totally new to me. Did not sell one coin and now paying the price for beeing a newbee at the time. I¬¥m not selling, hodl till all goes up again.

[30-Jul-18 06:31 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
you have to live it one time for your self to see how they play this game. These ~85% selloffs happend so often before but if you are new to this space you totally get surprised by it

[30-Jul-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
future word of caution: when you see a market that driven up by nothing more than fomo and happy feelings, know that it will eventually drop

[30-Jul-18 06:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
There's **still** no rational reason for BTC to be above $3,600

[30-Jul-18 06:35 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
in what else do you invest to diversify or are you only in KMD?

[30-Jul-18 06:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

_is surprising himself in that he hasn't spun off into one of his usual rants about Core yet_

[30-Jul-18 06:39 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
wonder if I should sell Neo and VeChain to get more KMD. Neo has the known problems and if VeChain will ever work??? KMD is working great, same goes for Digibyte (my stake is very small in that one). Elastos will stay my biggest back but then comes Neo and KMD. The staking is a great thing, works perfect

[30-Jul-18 06:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_used all of his DGB on a pr0n site_

[30-Jul-18 06:41 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
DGB is very fast at the moment, you can say instant even from HitBTC to desktop wallet, crazy fast.

Some people speculate how OKEx may play a big role in this regard. Their futures market is certainly crashing a lot harder compared to the rest of the exchanges.

Brewery work is very hard work.  You will be very tired after a full day brewing beer, maybe too tired to drink your free beer, maybe.
