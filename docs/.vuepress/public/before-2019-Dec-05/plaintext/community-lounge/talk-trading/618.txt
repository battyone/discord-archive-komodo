maybe we should market an index fund of ZEC forks to the normals

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto I guess hodling is all I can do. Else I will be probably selling those at loss

[09-May-19 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Alt bull market maybe help balance portfolio later

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't want to sell what I have

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
If you think it's going to be huge in the future, wait for it to bottom and buy some on the cheap

[09-May-19 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Agree

Sunk cost
In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost (also known as retrospective cost) is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.

[09-May-19 12:22 PM] Malti#3948
it seems that the only way for ZEC is down, why not sell and  buy back later at discount?

[09-May-19 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
I HODLed ZEC a long long time, I truly believed in it, didn't care about the price. But I guess I had my awakening and selling it all has been a great financial decision so far. By migrating into other coins, I am up 10% instead of down 10% in a few days. And I don't want to invest in the Zcash Mind Prison any more

[09-May-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
If I could short ZEC/BTC, I would

[09-May-19 12:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
I would short the shit out of it

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@dukeleto part of the question to ask, though, looking at that chart: despite what the markets traded at, was ZEC really ever worth $700-800 USD? 🤷🏽

[09-May-19 12:24 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It wasn't worth the 4 bitcoins a piece when it first hit the market. Still not sure how that was a thing.

[09-May-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
7 BTC = 1 ZEC, originally

[09-May-19 12:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 i wish i sold around then, lol

[09-May-19 12:25 PM] Malti#3948
so basically only 1000 ZEC was stolen from binance

lololol

[09-May-19 12:42 PM] Malti#3948
except for reduced sell pressure, does a halving has any other direct effect on price?

[09-May-19 12:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the market follows cost-to-mine any, a halving will cause a good bump in price

[09-May-19 12:45 PM] Malti#3948
yes but the 'if the market follows' is just based on incentives need to outperform costs

[09-May-19 12:45 PM] Malti#3948
so the main driver in higher prices are the miners

[09-May-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
if same demand for halved supply is the case, then indeed bump in price is expected

[09-May-19 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
miners are generally the drivers of lower prices, not higher

[09-May-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
but if the bump in prices makes for reduced demand as well

[09-May-19 12:46 PM] Malti#3948
how so ? @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[09-May-19 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as a general rule, miners aren't in crypto for crypto
to that end, they play "hot potato" and dump ASAP -- selling causes price decline

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] Malti#3948
okay but if prices are high, then it's in their best interest?

[09-May-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There are many miners that mine for or hold for future gains, but my experience shows them to be in the minority

[09-May-19 12:50 PM] Malti#3948
they sell in order to fund their operations

[09-May-19 12:50 PM] Malti#3948
and make profit obviously

[09-May-19 12:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just holding back for higher is in their interest, but (again, generally speaking) miners will take $2 now instead of "maybe" $4 later

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
almost invariably if there's a large gap between buy and sell price, miners will race to the bottom instead of forcing buyers up

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All this talk about ZEC death and "incapacity to go up" makes me think bottom might be near

[09-May-19 12:52 PM] Malti#3948
in a way they will exhaust a price instead of supporting it

[09-May-19 12:53 PM] Malti#3948
got it, so halving their rewards will halve the amount of x that dumps constantly on the market, so normal behaviour is prices go up

[09-May-19 12:53 PM] Malti#3948
thanks @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[09-May-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yeah, along with a total reduced supply, the dumping type miners have less to push the market down with

[09-May-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the bit that a lot of TA overlooks when trying to apply "traditional" market reading like as if it were stocks
the traditional method only works if you add the notion that there are splits every day

[09-May-19 12:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers i see various traders saying they loaded up on ZEC bags lately, they don't grasp the asic hardware cycle tho

[09-May-19 12:59 PM] klein#5233
@siu - Chainmakers context matters

[09-May-19 01:00 PM] klein#5233
before the crypto wide bottom and pump zcash was very weak

[09-May-19 01:01 PM] klein#5233
when it ralied

[09-May-19 01:01 PM] klein#5233
it did so lagging

[09-May-19 01:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
Is ZEC really worth even $50 ?

[09-May-19 01:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
Baffles me that it's worth 50X more than KMD when KMD does 50X more than ZEC does

[09-May-19 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
welcome to my daily exasperation 😛

[09-May-19 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, every day we get closer to KMD/ZEC parity

[09-May-19 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`every day we get closer to KMD/ZEC parity`
Yes, but sadly in the wrong direction

[09-May-19 01:06 PM] klein#5233
Komodo is barely on the radar of crypto funds

[09-May-19 01:06 PM] klein#5233
it is starting to get some attention

[09-May-19 01:07 PM] klein#5233
You have the likes of Shillbert getting his clients in steaming piles of shit like zcash and ethereum classic

[09-May-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
Grayscale owns lots of ETC, it must be a good investment

[09-May-19 01:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is even an entire unix directory dedicated to it

Their bitcoin fund has a 30% premium over its net asset value

[09-May-19 01:18 PM] klein#5233
how can you in good conscience let you customers pay such a ridiculous premium

[09-May-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is how wall street operates

[09-May-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
you thought ICO's were scammy?

[09-May-19 01:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
Wall Street got them beat

[09-May-19 01:19 PM] klein#5233
"but thats how its structured to operate"

$ZEC

Absolutely horrible chart. But I like setups like this. Nobody pays attention and then one spark of magic happens. It's seriously oversold and I can see beginning Bullish divergence on a hourly timeframe. This thing can bounce in the near future.

i think there might be Cryptocoins Anonymous meetings in the future, because traders talk like it's an addiction

ZEC will bounce, at some point. But why risk owning it until that bottom is found?

[09-May-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
Until Z11 and A9++ owners break even, many months from now, there will be massive sell pressure

[09-May-19 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
because you buy when there is blood in the streets

[09-May-19 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:p

[09-May-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
BTFD works with BTC

[09-May-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
but with ZEC, you would just be a frog boiled alive

[09-May-19 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`But why risk owning it until that bottom is found?`
I wonder, regularly, why folks buy large swaths when all indications are that a given market still has much drop left in it

[09-May-19 01:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hammered below 200sma... nice try KMD, nice try.

[09-May-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's hard to time tops or bottoms, and I am not saying to try to time the bottom to entry. But there are NO signs we have found bottom yet, all fundamentals say we are going much lower

[09-May-19 01:25 PM] Malti#3948
you mean ZEC right?

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
I was talking about ZEC, not KMD

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
sorry for all the ZEC talk, lol

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's what I mean, I can see buying when you think "well maybe we're close", but if you see it's still got a bit/bunch to drop just confuses me (when it's long-term traders)

[09-May-19 01:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
"buy strength not weakness" is a mantra I like

[09-May-19 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
200sma is a bouncer and KMD is not allowed to the party.

[09-May-19 01:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`sorry for all the ZEC talk, lol`
fek 'em if they don't like it; they make me read all the BTC silliness all the time :troll:

IBM has a wing dedicated to KMD r+d, I heard

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
they started to come out of the woodwork with KMD stuff on twitter

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] Malti#3948
lead by Lydia Schafer no?

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
yes

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
believe none of what you hear and only 1/2 of what you see 😛

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] Malti#3948
she's tweeting a lot about KMD

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are actually doing real stuff

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] Malti#3948
and she's a senior blockchain researcher at IBM

[09-May-19 01:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are at least 3 people at IBM doing KMD stuff

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
and they are promoting it

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] Malti#3948
I wonder which other chains they are also checking out then

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I think that is pretty huge

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] Malti#3948
I agree

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
IBM + KMD... not sure if i shall be happy or worried. 🤔

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Doesnt IBM makes everything they touch die?

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
well, they seem interested in KMD because it's a toolkit to make blockchains, and their biz will be custom blockchain enterprisey stuff

[09-May-19 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_wonders if there's more than 3 other people in here that remember when IBM was on top of the tech food-chain_
