I guess at least it's not dumping. It's like a green monolith. no explanation of it's origin. It's just there, existing.

Its easy to spend retarded amounts of money on shit you dont need when it‚Äôs not your own money, but in the meantime your investors are as rekt as can be.

[27-Aug-19 06:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you are raking in million after million and everyone is making money and happy, idgaf if you fly private. But with so many people rekt, get a fucking grip and have some sense of reality jezus

[27-Aug-19 06:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338

Looking at the pic, its probably even first class

the only reason people are rkt is because they believed all the nonsense fud about it, there is still some time left to rebuy a position

@Patrick Friggens lol pls look at redfox website and tell me where it is a scam, they never confirmed the 5m it might just have been k64 talking nothing else

[27-Aug-19 08:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[27-Aug-19 08:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wtf

[27-Aug-19 08:41 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why you allow this scam  on kmd ecosystem

[27-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you cant allow/disallow shit

[27-Aug-19 08:41 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ok

[27-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd ecysystem is decentralized

[27-Aug-19 08:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no censorship

[27-Aug-19 08:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Look at order book

[27-Aug-19 08:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Kmd

[27-Aug-19 08:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
You see decentralized

[27-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the tech is decentralized, what do the markets have to do with that?

[27-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
even if I held 50M kmd I couldnt enforce jack shit

[27-Aug-19 08:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
just saying üòÑ

[27-Aug-19 09:00 AM] CoinKing88#1540
With 50m kmd you have a lot of votes for node selection. Potentially you Can have control over the marjority? Doesnt that mean you got control?

[27-Aug-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
control over what?

[27-Aug-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
all notarizations are validated

[27-Aug-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
you can withold notarizations, but you cant create fake notarizations.

[27-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah plus, holding 50M kmd makes me the biggest stakeholder and makes my financial incentive even bigger that notaries do their job properly

[27-Aug-19 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so if I tried fucking with notaries or whatever, that would backfire even bigger financially as kmd price would be worthless

frens we have a new date for LN

[27-Aug-19 09:47 AM] Tek#5253
only 18 more months!

[27-Aug-19 09:47 AM] Tek#5253
Agreed, but we have 18 months to improve Lightning Network to the point that it can support this demand! Alternatively I could order the Dept of Treasury to nationalize Coinbase and do everything off-chain there. üôÉ

[27-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jorian#4555
at that time the FED will have its own blockchain. no more need for LN

we'll see what it brings

[27-Aug-19 11:52 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
If some people feel rekt by K64 there will be a buy back program: 

`We will also provide a process for the people who have felt *rekt* to contact us their claim (proof of purchase from DigitalPrice for example) and we will - if provided the necessary information - buy back the price they purchased K64 for. As I will be traveling to Milan tomorrow, and am unable to process with the care it requires these claims, K64 will provide a digital form for this and we will make sure they are reimbursed before the end of this week. `

though I feel there won't be many asking for it after this week has passed

[27-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I still hope it's legit, but you have to agree that a lot of the communication, including todays photo's of first class flights is just bad form

[27-Aug-19 11:53 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
It's indeed not ideal

[27-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I hope they really secured 78M and RFOX gets 5M and K64 pumps to the moon etc, as it would benefit the ecosystem as a whole

[27-Aug-19 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but seriously they should get someone to do all communications

[27-Aug-19 11:54 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Didn't they have a Media manager? I thought so...

[27-Aug-19 11:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362

fudders are saying that the guy that won, now needs to pay 2billion in estate taxes

[27-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which would require him to sell a big chunk of btc which would drop price

[27-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but tbh, 2 billion in btc even when dumped, would that really make such a dent?

[27-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jorian#4555
no way he's selling that on the market

[27-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jorian#4555
even if he had it

[27-Aug-19 12:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what if he doesnt have it

[27-Aug-19 12:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but the guy still needs to pay estate tax?

[27-Aug-19 12:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
would be the ultimate way to have someone rekt üòÑ
