Yes, I'm glad that it's up; however, when undervalued by $1, 4¢ increase isn't enough to start forming the circlejerk just yet

Hard to get excited at a 15% increase when it's still 500% away from being just 50% from it's ATH.

[10-Oct-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well, ath is artificially inflated, so there's that

I thought we were supposed to hit $50 in June?

There's a new coin doing these little jumps every day 😑

[10-Oct-18 03:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Anyone watching the other markets, like the DOW? Not looking good.

[10-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Mische#6695

[10-Oct-18 03:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Can’t ignore the reason for the season though, it was @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[10-Oct-18 04:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
what i don't understand though. Who is selling his bags at ~17-19? Unless you bought right at 14/15 and made some little profit from that. Seems kinda meh.

[10-Oct-18 04:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
ICO whales?  Who knows

Holy shit, where did that volume come from?

[10-Oct-18 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
setting aside recent events, is 45k *really* a "lot" of volume?

[10-Oct-18 04:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
@bpkdasbaum profits in fiat terms

[10-Oct-18 04:37 PM] snowdamn#2414
small but still

[10-Oct-18 04:38 PM] snowdamn#2414
wait, 9x might not be that small

[10-Oct-18 04:38 PM] snowdamn#2414
was it more?

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
9x has to be "small", BTC is 16x over 29 months and that's "rekt"; so, what's 56% of rekt?

[10-Oct-18 04:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
dead cats raining from the sky in normie land

[10-Oct-18 04:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
yikes, wish coinbase would hurry the fuck up w/ my order

[10-Oct-18 04:45 PM] snowdamn#2414
ok, if you were one of the first ones i guess it's 13x in fiat terms

[10-Oct-18 04:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
that means i'm after 570-1140x 😅

[10-Oct-18 04:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Whoever caught the bottom of KMD is 536x

[10-Oct-18 04:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Just got an email about that yobit pump

[10-Oct-18 05:07 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I've explained that low was because of the hacker finding a way to make coins for free and he was only able to dump on one shit exchange. Hard to count that low.

[10-Oct-18 05:10 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Those coins were also forked off so someone purchased a bag full of useless hacked KMD coins.

[10-Oct-18 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
better them buying than me 😛

[10-Oct-18 05:13 PM] Japesmith#0609
Cryptox.pl !

[10-Oct-18 05:13 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Nearly 95% of all KMD trading at the time was on Bittrex and they disabled deposit/withdraws the moment they were informed so that left the hacker to find another avenue to dump it.

[10-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
It was cryptox. I forgot the name of the exchange, but no one worked on the weekends so it was the only exchange for the hacker to use because of that.

I fell asleep in #safespace  it was amazing kittens and puppies and rainbows.  Then as I awoke I saw a 6 colored rainbow instead of the accepted 7 color one and it pissed me the fuck off.  Triggered!
