[26-Jun-19 04:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
i try not to think about all the money i lost in crypto by either boat missing or fraud. likely enough to set me for life.

[26-Jun-19 04:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I have one of the first 10 atomic trades in my wallet

[26-Jun-19 04:42 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Dont you want to own that?

[26-Jun-19 04:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
i'm just idealistic. it's more about changing the world than getting rich.

[26-Jun-19 04:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Ok...I guess I'll go get drunk then

[26-Jun-19 04:43 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

Btc graph looks like satellite antenne

[26-Jun-19 04:48 AM] pinkolin#9557
Mooning over 20k?

[26-Jun-19 04:49 AM] pinkolin#9557
Its not look like correction is close

[26-Jun-19 04:49 AM] Bittersweet#9376
no alt summer this time â˜¹

[26-Jun-19 04:52 AM] pinkolin#9557
With this speed, correction before july

[26-Jun-19 04:52 AM] pinkolin#9557
Maybe after alt summer

[26-Jun-19 04:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I highly doubt it this time

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
No alt investors

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] pinkolin#9557
Btc mooning == cheap money

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
i'm not even trying to read the tea leaves on this insanity

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] pinkolin#9557
Cheap money == KMD mooning after

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Only Facebook and BTC

[26-Jun-19 04:53 AM] grumpygoron#4320
So how low is KMD going this time...so close to sub 10k sats I want to cry lol

[26-Jun-19 04:54 AM] actionslacks#4072

[26-Jun-19 04:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Only when KMD descides not to be open source

[26-Jun-19 04:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
You cant sell free

[26-Jun-19 04:55 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Free is free

[26-Jun-19 04:55 AM] pinkolin#9557
What about some counter on komodoplatform website? Not?

[26-Jun-19 04:55 AM] pinkolin#9557
You dont need reason, only counter

[26-Jun-19 04:55 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Weâ€™ve been burned by counters too much in the past

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Even counter won't work this time

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] Bittersweet#9376
ðŸ˜‚

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
It has been taken over @Hollowman9000  is correct

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] pinkolin#9557
No? And what about BIG counter

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Antara deadline needs to be held to on promised date or all my hope is lost.  I canâ€™t deal with another lie of a promised delivery date

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] pinkolin#9557
Only biiiiig counter and no info

[26-Jun-19 04:56 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
You need corporate IP protection

[26-Jun-19 04:57 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Last time alts started surging was after btc beat previous ath

[26-Jun-19 04:57 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Maybe that's what's going to happen again

[26-Jun-19 04:57 AM] pinkolin#9557
Counter with microseconds

[26-Jun-19 04:57 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
Focus on decentralized

Very fast counter

[26-Jun-19 04:57 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Well weâ€™re close to an atl, so thatâ€™s fun

[26-Jun-19 04:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
traders who are drunk on btc gains buy up alts seeking even more gains

[26-Jun-19 04:58 AM] pinkolin#9557

[26-Jun-19 04:59 AM] pinkolin#9557

[26-Jun-19 04:59 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
We ain't dumb....we just slow

[26-Jun-19 05:00 AM] pinkolin#9557
Lambo counter and hookers

[26-Jun-19 05:00 AM] grumpygoron#4320
And now the Komodo discord is recommending selling KMD for K64 ðŸ˜‚ even our own community has lost faith

[26-Jun-19 05:00 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I think kmd has the most unfortunate ta timing lol

[26-Jun-19 05:00 AM] pinkolin#9557
And snowing cokaine

[26-Jun-19 05:00 AM] kmdkrazy#8280

[26-Jun-19 05:01 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
A genious creates a platform that is free

[26-Jun-19 05:01 AM] pinkolin#9557

In a rocket

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
wtf is counter?

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] pinkolin#9557
Maybe counter on big tits

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Is the counter showing current KMD price?

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] Bittersweet#9376
No it's a count down

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] pinkolin#9557
Countdown

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Nobody knows what to

[26-Jun-19 05:04 AM] grumpygoron#4320
Or how many people sold their KMD after getting it back from the hack?

[26-Jun-19 05:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm always in komodo long term komodo is a for sure bet.

[26-Jun-19 05:05 AM] Mark81#4505
