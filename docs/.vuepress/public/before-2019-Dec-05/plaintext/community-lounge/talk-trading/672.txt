[22-May-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810

[22-May-19 07:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
that does not sound like a smart thing to do...

Hmm, maybe a liguana, I think komodo's are even bigger?

[22-May-19 07:41 AM] Kay Gee#2313
@Tek#5253 fuck your ignorant ass. You‚Äôre simple, naive,  xenophobic vitriol is one of the blockers to mass adoption. So long as aul Breitbart Bae‚Äôs perspective is associated with the tech in any way, and so long as devs and the community don‚Äôt visibly condemn his racist shtick, many people will view this space as an off shoot of 4 Chan, populated by trolls and angry, uneducated, small, twats.

let us stay away from the profanities, but expressing your point of view should be allowed. no requirement to agree with anybody

Used some racist terms in his rant about quitting work

[22-May-19 08:00 AM] Malti#3948

[22-May-19 08:13 AM] jorian#4555

Kay got triggered long ago when I used the word ‚Äúcuck‚Äù

[22-May-19 08:23 AM] mrlynch#5735

if u think it's bad in BE, there are families in the UK, 3rd generation that haven't worked a day in their life

[22-May-19 08:27 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's their heritage and "job" i guess

[22-May-19 08:32 AM] mrlynch#5735
we are doing it now
problem is we have to fight ignorant, selfish, lazy, uneducated, greedy "leaders" that have access to on-demand money and power
so it takes a little longer

[22-May-19 08:41 AM] Malti#3948
instead of going back to sociopolitical discussions, we forget the real point of this channel
