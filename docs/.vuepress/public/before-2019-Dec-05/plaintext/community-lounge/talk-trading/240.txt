`well, now you want to make "book" plural?`
Where do you live that 1 book constitutes a "library"?

[21-Oct-18 05:41 PM] jl777c#5810
likely cases from the 1800s still apply in some cases

[21-Oct-18 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
you said there was one book, chief

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
and you said that the laws were countable

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ffs

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
that they could be quantified

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
you are just wrong and it is chapping your calamari ring to be wrong, i get it

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
you friggin hate being wrong

[21-Oct-18 05:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
too bad its not uncommon for you

[21-Oct-18 05:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they are countable, they even have numbers and heading and chapters and everything
If you can't add 1 to the last number you counted, that doesn't make it "uncountable"

[21-Oct-18 05:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
point me to a comprehensive source of laws, genie.  one that includes every law on the books, state, local, federal, reservation, international

[21-Oct-18 05:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
then you will have proved your point.

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
because that is what you claimed

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
in your really smart ass way you claimed that there was one book that anyone could look at because there were copies of it everywhere

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes let us keep the discussion fact based and objective

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
lexisnexis.com will be happy to sell you all the collections you like, since you can't seem to count

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
and that is what i am asking for from Genie.  facts

[21-Oct-18 05:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
Property is no longer owned, it is rented from the govt via taxation

[21-Oct-18 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
is lexisnexis free?

[21-Oct-18 05:45 PM] meatspoon#7860
i dont want all the collections, genie.  i want the one you claim exists and is easily accessible

[21-Oct-18 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c no
@meatspoon take it up with your county court clerk

[21-Oct-18 05:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
haha, of course

[21-Oct-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is a conspiracy by lawyers to keep it hidded?

[21-Oct-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
hidden

[21-Oct-18 05:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that way they can charge big money for access to the secrets

[21-Oct-18 05:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
maybe genie makes big sweeping statements about things he doesn't have knowledge of and then tries to use semantics to not look so foolish

[21-Oct-18 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not hidden, it's that people like @meatspoon keep misinforming other people, so most people never know it exists

[21-Oct-18 05:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
so the WSJ and any other media outlet who have run this story (and there have been several) are all misinforming the people, eh?  But Genie, the one and only, is the guy who has it all figured out.  gotchya

[21-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Lumbi#8378
audits for all except for the top? or clear rules? the first is gonna win democracies and other merit-based systems

[21-Oct-18 05:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
For a judge to withhold access to a law library is a disbarrable offense

Genie, Do you wear big red squeaky shoes, a rainbow afro wig, a red nose and a colorful jumpsuit when you type in discord?

[21-Oct-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
I think access to law library and law library having all applicable laws are two totally different things

[21-Oct-18 05:49 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon plz no personal stuff

[21-Oct-18 05:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
is calling anyone who disagrees with one's opinion "stupid" considered personal stuff?

[21-Oct-18 05:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think he found something on mit servers he wasnt supposed to see.

`I think access to law library and law library having all applicable laws are two totally different things`
Admittedly, many fall short of what they are required to have, but a simple Circuit Court filing tends to get them to snap to pretty quick if/when they do

[21-Oct-18 05:51 PM] actionslacks#4072
Aaron was killed

[21-Oct-18 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon fair enough, genie shouldnt be calling people stupid

[21-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Lumbi#8378
can smart contracts make the current legal system obselete?

[21-Oct-18 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Who did I say was "stupid"?

[21-Oct-18 05:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
thank you.  Genie has called over half the people in here idiots, either directly or indirectly by labeling all owners of top 10 coins as idiots

[21-Oct-18 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
besides myself?

[21-Oct-18 05:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
gotta run.  thanks to everyone for the entertaining conversation

hmm, that sounded personal

[21-Oct-18 05:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
He was federally prosecuted. The only reason he didnt survive is because we was gonna win his case and they wanted him to be an example imo

[21-Oct-18 05:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
was that personal?

[21-Oct-18 05:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
seems like "go fuck yourself" is a little bit personal.

[21-Oct-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810

@snowdamn nobody knows who satoshi is either and bitcoin remains #1 😉

[21-Oct-18 05:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
I will troll spot.

[21-Oct-18 05:55 PM] snowdamn#2414
yup

[21-Oct-18 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
so ur argument is invalid

[21-Oct-18 05:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
i said will not

[21-Oct-18 05:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in the short term, it would help if I was public, but in the long term it would be much worse

[21-Oct-18 05:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
especially for you 😂

[21-Oct-18 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c is satoshi :trollface:

[21-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Lumbi#8378
It shouldn't be about personage, but rather a functioning DAO / non-profit.

[21-Oct-18 05:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
you can thank me later for stopping the shitshow...

[21-Oct-18 05:58 PM] Lumbi#8378
A clear mandate, clear instructions.

[21-Oct-18 05:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
Jl777 going public would be a complete shitshow

[21-Oct-18 05:59 PM] snowdamn#2414
i would feel very bad if it was against his wishes

[21-Oct-18 06:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
Im sure there are many who are aware the the person’s identity. The fact that they have kept quiet is likely a testament to character.

machine learning...

[21-Oct-18 06:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
James being anon will the be biggest benefit ever for Komodo, in my opinion.
the opposite of what being a known would/could have been.
Consider James just a 0 or 1 code. not a human. a code.
To us the code matters. his/her work. not identity.

[21-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
finally philosophy is invited back to the top...

[21-Oct-18 06:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
also, decentralized identity will leave the real life identities of no value.

[21-Oct-18 06:06 PM] Lumbi#8378
governance is the top floor

[21-Oct-18 06:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this is the only problem until decentralized identity problems are unsolved.

[21-Oct-18 06:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once solved, nobody will care who is anon or not anon.

[21-Oct-18 06:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
i'd rather have jl777 be anonymous but available to assist interested parties (as he has been nonstop) than being public and inevitably unapproachable 
but don't get hit by a bus, please!

Jl777 only travels by vtol and thus will never het hit by a bus

funny thing about the "get hit by a bus" thing is that it would have same result even if he were public lol

@crypto_miso hi there, first all thanks for your efforts on the site. Noticed that on komodo it only tracks one part of the project (barterdex) instead the platform. If possible please update it to pull data with these githubs: https://t.co/OXQHseKkcn
