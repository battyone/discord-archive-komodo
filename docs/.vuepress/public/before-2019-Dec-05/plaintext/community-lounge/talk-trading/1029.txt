Bitcoin sucking the air out of the market. Altcoins loosing both in Fiat and Btc. Very sad state for ppl who backed, holded and supported good projects. ALTs "must" decouple to survive. Only possible if there gonna be alt/fiat pairs with bigger volume then alt/btc. Until then ALTs are doomed. Sad but true. Sell everything! Me? I am not selling. Rather let my alt coins burn then sell for this ridiculous price.

[06-Aug-19 11:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Can't get rekt when you are in stable coin   . You can keep USD and rise in value

[06-Aug-19 11:15 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
No-brainer really

[06-Aug-19 11:39 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[07-Aug-19 12:21 AM] washparkdlt#6482
The alt sentiment is just disastrous. Depression and despair are everywhere.

[07-Aug-19 12:21 AM] washparkdlt#6482

[07-Aug-19 04:42 AM] allbits#5898
@jspook16 have you actually looked lately? Or maybe you're looking for more than 22000 kmd?

[07-Aug-19 04:43 AM] allbits#5898
You can also be a maker and just let your btc sit there and wait for takers

[07-Aug-19 05:30 AM] weldon.gull5#3242

[07-Aug-19 05:31 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Chinese aunt is on the way

[07-Aug-19 06:18 AM] jspook16#3059
Thanks. Didn't see it before

[07-Aug-19 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is very active development to make a liquidity bot allowing your grandma to click a few buttons to arb from a CEX and sell on a DEX

[07-Aug-19 07:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So whilst liquidity is low right now, just wait till Sep when all the US customers are looking for a fix.

[07-Aug-19 07:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyways, people choose what they want to do but keep in mind, for the most part, the team and all the people wanting KMD to succeed probably have the most invested, so why would they not want the price to go up?

[07-Aug-19 07:18 AM] Tek#5253
when kmd was ~16k sats

[07-Aug-19 07:18 AM] Tek#5253
I came in here and placed a buy order at 7777 sats

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Congrats

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] Tek#5253
yeah fuck this shit

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] Tek#5253
I removved it and bought above 10k

[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Cool

[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] Tek#5253
kmd needs to get on more markets or its gonna tank into nothingness

[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will look like a great buy sooner or later

[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD needs to finish the tech, which is what they are doing

[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] Tek#5253
im just hoping it will go back to 20k sats somethimes

[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Cool, get on social to spread the word

[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Get more people involved and interest to buy your bags

[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] Tek#5253
your marketing team should do that

[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you can discord you can do other things too. should/would/could, take some action to make the price go up so you can sell

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
nah. not my job

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253
pay me kmd to do it

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do testing, go answer questions on twitter, do something productive

[07-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Pay you for your inability to not take responsibility over your few k KMD investment?

[07-Aug-19 07:23 AM] Tek#5253

[07-Aug-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when I hear marking do some more effort, I really expect specifics what is people's wish.
the specifics will help a lot. The useful feedback. Just the word "marketing should do something" demands something marketing isn't doing enough good, and they should put more effort, which they are doing really harder than ever before.
After Developers, they are the golden gems of Komodo Platform team. They work behind the scenes a lot.

[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] Tek#5253
either you put me on the marketing team and i market kmd in my spare time

[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
People make investments, take responsibility for doing that. If you regret and think we are going to 0, dump, if you believe in it do something to help the project.

[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] Tek#5253
or you dont

[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let's ride it to 0

[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont worry about the fact that you are a grown adult but lets wait for mummy and daddy to make the boo boo alright

[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
:troll_hardcore:

[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] Tek#5253
look in the mirror

[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not getting paid and paying others to help this community. I am taking responsibility of my actions to make sure my investment choice is a good one.

[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] Tek#5253
Good for you.

[07-Aug-19 07:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So like i said, keep complaining and doing nothing or be a man and do something productive.

[07-Aug-19 07:28 AM] Tek#5253
I'm at work lmao

[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not talking about now

[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] Tek#5253
I got better things to do after work.

[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] Tek#5253
I already watch a screen 8 hours a day here.

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] Tek#5253
I rather not be a computer bound zombie

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Obviously different people can contribute in different ways, but saying we are going to 0 basically because of marketing, well do something to try to fix that or help that

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] Tek#5253
Wow bro

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] Tek#5253
The only one who said that we are going to 0 was you

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So either you think it will hit 0 then you should get out now or do something productive

[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
Let everyone help KMD build a better marketüíØ
