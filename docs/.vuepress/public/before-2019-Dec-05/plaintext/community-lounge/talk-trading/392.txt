[31-Jan-19 07:01 AM] Zanzarismo#6500
I never actually believed I'd actually get some KMD below 10k sat

[31-Jan-19 07:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Dang I had no low buys setup.

Re: NEM - “Tinsman said the foundation spent roughly 80 million XEM between December 2017 and January 2019, primarily on marketing.”

[31-Jan-19 09:25 AM] tolken#2655
Nice.

`LOL who just dumped KMD mega hard on digitalprice.io?`
with
` 24hr Volume 0.12775428BTC`
the answer would be
"No one 'dumped KMD mega hard on digitalprice.io'."

[31-Jan-19 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
700 KMD is hardly a "mega dump"

[31-Jan-19 10:28 AM] hastrup#8742

[31-Jan-19 10:28 AM] hastrup#8742

gtg for now, feel free to dm me or let me know here 😃

[31-Jan-19 08:15 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 volume might not fit your standard, but the price....

[31-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I figured you'd be able to decipher that, given your genius wisdom 😏

[31-Jan-19 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
perhaps someone needed quick BTC, didn't want to give out 🐔 info and didn't care about the $2 "loss"...

[31-Jan-19 08:17 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I hope it was you

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
6500 sat for KMD, can't complain 😇

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
not that that was MY bid that got filled

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
but I'm happy for whoever it was

[31-Jan-19 08:18 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
a great deal

[31-Jan-19 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not selling my KMD under psuedo $2 unless I believe I see a dip coming

[31-Jan-19 08:19 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
that's not unwise

[31-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I just find it wild that price lost 2/3 value in a matter of minutes lol

[31-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
rebound fairly quick though

[31-Jan-19 08:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
well that's bound to happen on a market with minimal volume
because of the markets and volume on DP, OUR dropped 98% in price with the trade of **one** coin

[31-Jan-19 08:24 PM] Zanzarismo#6500

:troll_compadre:

[31-Jan-19 08:33 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
you like nootropics @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 ?

[31-Jan-19 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
never heard of it because I don't do drugs

[31-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
do you drink coffee?

[31-Jan-19 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I drink mud that most people add 99% more water and call coffee

[31-Jan-19 08:35 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
then you do drugs. Don't lie to me :troll_thuglife:

[31-Jan-19 08:35 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
drugs aren't inherently bad.... it's all about use/abuse. Intention is key

[31-Jan-19 08:35 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
they are tools for your mind.

[31-Jan-19 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually, I'm immune to the effects of caffeine 😛

[31-Jan-19 08:36 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
then you do more drugs than I do

[31-Jan-19 08:36 PM] and1"ヅblubbi Vote for NN19#5646
i would call that addicted

{Reactions}
labs troll_king 

[31-Jan-19 08:36 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
because I'm hyper sensitive to caffeine lol. I barely drink coffee anymore. Tea is a gentleman's drink

[31-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
reality is not very often, absolute.

[31-Jan-19 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
around here, only old ladies drink tea

[31-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
that's fair

[31-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
and dandy 😉

[31-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
around here, I'm one of a kind myself

[31-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I don't know very many who fancy tea like I do

[31-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I always (when at home) drink out of a silver kettle, not to be fancy, but for health reasons.

[31-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
Lol, this is random.... But have you seen Troll 2, the movie?

[31-Jan-19 08:41 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
there's a scene in it, where they claim coffee is the devils drink. hilarious

[31-Jan-19 08:48 PM] and1"ヅblubbi Vote for NN19#5646
i love the coffee bourbon fusion, my favourite style

[31-Jan-19 08:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's wrong on so many levels 🤦🏽

[31-Jan-19 08:55 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
alcohol is too much fun, it gets me in trouble lol

[31-Jan-19 08:55 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I prefer the fine herbs, when I partake. which is not often anymore

[31-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
Kahlua and coffee go good together though!

[31-Jan-19 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
liqueur .... bourbon....ffs, do any of you people have taste-buds?

[31-Jan-19 08:59 PM] and1"ヅblubbi Vote for NN19#5646
sometimes on some speial mornings i also put some scotch into

[31-Jan-19 08:59 PM] and1"ヅblubbi Vote for NN19#5646
uu love thoose morning ❤

[31-Jan-19 08:59 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
in school I could, wiht uncanny accuracy, differentiate the difference between coke and pepsi

[31-Jan-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL I guess every morning is special here then 😛 but be damned if I'd fuk it up with coffee

[31-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
drinking alcohol in the morning....

[31-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
and you accused me of doing drugs LOL

[31-Jan-19 09:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`in school I could, wiht uncanny accuracy, differentiate the difference between coke and pepsi`
That's like bragging that you can tell the difference between wood and concrete 😛

[31-Jan-19 09:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
yeah, but I don't normally drink that tasty poison

[31-Jan-19 09:01 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
pop is gross tbh

[31-Jan-19 09:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`drinking alcohol in the morning....`
is not the same as sipping scotch; not even in the same sphere

[31-Jan-19 09:02 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
to each their own man, I'm just spinning the ball around since you accused me 😛

[31-Jan-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"pop"? which part of the south are you from? :troll:

[31-Jan-19 09:04 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
