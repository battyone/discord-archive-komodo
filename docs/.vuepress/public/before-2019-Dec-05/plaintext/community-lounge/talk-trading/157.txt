@Cryptoon you're right I just thought only dicos were on dexstats

[16-Sep-18 06:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Its called dico list on dexstats but as mnz is on there as well I dunno... maybe add everything? Shows more usage

[16-Sep-18 06:21 AM] jspook16#3059

@siu - Chainmakers I'll take that as a maybe. Anyone want some LIZZIE coins?

[16-Sep-18 03:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
what is LIZZIE?

[16-Sep-18 03:31 PM] jspook16#3059
its an ac i created to test that i can create it lol. all the info said it was simple to make your own so i tried it and it works. I almost bricked it because i enabled staking and almost didnt stake in time before the difficulty got too high.

[16-Sep-18 03:31 PM] jspook16#3059
I named it after a lizard....doesnt really do anything right now

[16-Sep-18 03:31 PM] jspook16#3059

@jspook16 can you elaborate on the process of staking p

[16-Sep-18 04:13 PM] PTYX#6840
How does it work exactly in order not to brick it

[16-Sep-18 04:17 PM] jspook16#3059
I was reading through the info to create a new chain and the staking parameter section talked about staking some coins on the server that initiated the ac. But it has to be done before block 100 if the ac percentage is high

[16-Sep-18 04:17 PM] jspook16#3059
I think it has something to do with the difficulty being too high

[16-Sep-18 04:17 PM] jspook16#3059
there was another link where i read that ....let me see if i can find that one too

[16-Sep-18 04:23 PM] jspook16#3059
"It‚Äôs important to start staking immediately for high percentages of POS. If too many POW blocks are mined consecutively at the start of the chain, the POW difficulty may increase enough to stop the chain entirely, meaning you can‚Äôt send a transaction to staking nodes."

[16-Sep-18 04:23 PM] jspook16#3059
@PTYX

[16-Sep-18 04:25 PM] jspook16#3059
I take that to mean that if I wait too long to split for staking, that I wont be able to once the difficulty is too high (of I would have to wait a really really long time)

[16-Sep-18 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
Very Interesting thank you

[16-Sep-18 04:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I collect useless coins

[16-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jspook16#3059
lol its useless today ...but who knows tomorrow. Where do i send to?

[16-Sep-18 04:32 PM] jspook16#3059
@PTYX np. Glad I could actually help

[16-Sep-18 04:35 PM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 dm me a place to send some Lizzies üòÉ

[16-Sep-18 04:37 PM] jspook16#3059
you can stake them too if you want (cli only). Im working on getting it into Agama locally on my workstation. If i can figure it out, I'll request to have it added officially (long shot) and if so actually develop it for something

[16-Sep-18 04:40 PM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 sent. Thanks for letting me send you some. You're the first so i hooked you up.

[16-Sep-18 04:41 PM] Mische#6695
How long did it take you to do it @jspook16

[16-Sep-18 04:41 PM] Mische#6695
?

[16-Sep-18 04:46 PM] jspook16#3059
@Mische so im going to answer that with a caveat. I am familiar with kmd-cli and DNS-setup. It took me about 4 hours. Most of that time was to sync up the kmd chain (i did this on a new server). With the kmd chain synced up, it probably takes 90 minutes. If you are new to kmd-cli and or DNS setup, I think it will take 8 hours. There are tutorials to set up a DNS, tutorials to install komodo, and tutorials to create the asset chain. You do need two instances of komodo running to do this.

[16-Sep-18 04:46 PM] jspook16#3059
Once you do it once, creating a new asset chain takes about 15 to 30 mins. Most of that time is deciding what parameters you want to create the chain with.

[16-Sep-18 04:53 PM] jspook16#3059
@Mische you want the links?

[16-Sep-18 05:03 PM] jspook16#3059
well here is the link if anybody wants it.

[16-Sep-18 05:05 PM] jspook16#3059
there is other valuable info there as well

[16-Sep-18 05:09 PM] jspook16#3059
oh snap!. KV is part of each asset chain too. Anyone know what the KV size limit is?

[16-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Mische#6695
Thank you very much ! I will use this for a schoolproject

[16-Sep-18 05:49 PM] jspook16#3059
Cool i hope it works out for you

[16-Sep-18 07:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Who went in on Pungo?   I just bought about 4500 pgt

[16-Sep-18 07:04 PM] jspook16#3059

[16-Sep-18 07:04 PM] jspook16#3059
good luck though

[16-Sep-18 07:04 PM] jspook16#3059
would have preferred it be a dico

[16-Sep-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I like the model of verifying value of a token strictly by the company revenue.  
Very much agree about the dICO but they have to have some form of aml KYC I imagine with what yhey are trying to build.

[16-Sep-18 07:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I agree about the dICO though too.

[16-Sep-18 07:11 PM] jspook16#3059
