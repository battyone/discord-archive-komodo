Any other good links or things to explain to him?

[04-Oct-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure about explaining to a non-blockchain person...

[04-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ah so theres quite a big jump between a normal dev and being able to apply that knowledge into blockchain work

[04-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if being a blockchain dev was easy to become, we would have more than a few dozen real core devs

[04-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
of course any really good dev will be able to get up to speed, but it would take at least a year, if not more, regardless of how good they are

[04-Oct-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a totally different way you need to look at things

[04-Oct-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why the CC approach is much better as you dont need to learn about all of blockchain coding. once you understand utxo you are halfway there

[04-Oct-18 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Alright, il send through the github, the solution to scaling and a few other docs and hopefully he can help out in someway one day

@Deleted User cryptoconditions.info

[04-Oct-18 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
easy to remember and it forwards to that github link

[04-Oct-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it's all about fundamental knowledge. The very very starting point for any dev MUST be the bitcoin whitepaper. And then some course online, which covers the whole topic. and there are few free online courses on introducing bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

After bitcoin whitepaper, I'd highly recommend Mastering Bitcoin book by Andreas. It's amazing start for any developer.

[04-Oct-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And after Mastering Bitcoin, read jl777's Mastering CryptoConditions.

[04-Oct-18 12:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
only 3 things in a to do list for a dev.

[04-Oct-18 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and they can give ultimate challenge to any smart contract platform out there.

"Venezuela Makes Petro Crypto a National Currency" in news headlines
i wouldn't buy the hype until you can deposit directly to bank outside Venezuela
but it IS the time to buy Petro Crypto if you believe it will happen
or if straight up gambler since now would have to cash out through Venezuela bank 😂

[04-Oct-18 04:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

@jspook16 Are you saying I should raise rates?

[04-Oct-18 11:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Devpro is notorious for asking way over current market price over in verus discord trading

[05-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
We don’t think he’s made a trade yet

[05-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
His ask is constantly adjusted and is essentially [market.price*1.3]

[05-Oct-18 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bit of a running joke over there

[05-Oct-18 12:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[05-Oct-18 12:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 that price is 0.01 KMD per over the bottom of the market (onboarding price)

[05-Oct-18 12:02 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's at a discount because it's 1 lot

[05-Oct-18 12:04 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`discord-9LhDSask4qpuWa4SyhToday at 4:04 PM
100 000 PIRATE were successfully sold at 0.24 KMD! Arrr!!!`
👆🏼 again a discount for volume

[05-Oct-18 12:11 AM] bishop#9773
Why are two people trying to sell CHIPS at like 5-6x what they are currently going for... what am I missing? I get that there is some volume to what they want to move, but that is devproy premium, on crack.

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Oct-18 12:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@bishop Because "what they are going for" is equal to what someone sells them for, not what some shitty, broke down CEX lists them for or what a 0 liquidity DEX has them priced at

[05-Oct-18 12:14 AM] bishop#9773
Fine, price is what you pay, value is what you get. I'll pass.

[05-Oct-18 12:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CoinX market is what CoinX sells for, not what you think it *should* sell for

[05-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S. - if no one ever sells "above market" then the market never goes up, because math

[05-Oct-18 12:15 AM] bishop#9773
well, good thing these coins aren't going to move

[05-Oct-18 12:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
funny

[05-Oct-18 12:16 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was thinking about buying them at that cheap price 😕

[05-Oct-18 12:16 AM] bishop#9773
you should, then you can prove me wrong, again.

👍🏼

[05-Oct-18 12:21 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Most of that was a rant towards the ignorance of his being incredulous about CHIPS asking price of 0.25 and no one batted an eyelash when we were selling in bulk for 0.91 not too long ago

[05-Oct-18 12:22 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
tbh, it's a deep discount buyback for many of us

[05-Oct-18 12:25 AM] bishop#9773
Rant came after 😛

[05-Oct-18 02:25 AM] jspook16#3059

2fa on new phone, all passwords completely random on a new laptop, so definitely wasn’t my main pc being compromised

[05-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Haven’t even logged in since I made new pw

[05-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
And now they’ve already reset it to something else, without access to my email (99% sure)

[05-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is that possibly btcmarkets being compromised or some bug that allows a password reset without access to persons email?

[05-Oct-18 03:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah fiat to btc

[05-Oct-18 03:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Even if they could bypass a password reset

[05-Oct-18 03:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
They’d still hypothetically need my 2fa right?
