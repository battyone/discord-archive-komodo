"SELL AN EMOTION, NOT JUST A PRODUCT" - Dahl-

[01-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
this is a so true

[01-Sep-19 06:51 PM] Markus#5464
it would help if ppl didnt sell every day

[01-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
some people mine to pay for bills

[01-Sep-19 06:52 PM] Markus#5464
but its probably whales pushing down price to buy back at 300% lower price

[01-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Markus#5464
only ppl who would benefit from kmd mining is notary nodes since they mine 75% of blocks, doubt there is many ppl mining kmd for profit

[01-Sep-19 06:53 PM] Markus#5464
specially not to sell it right away

[01-Sep-19 06:54 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
notary has to pay bills üòÑ

[01-Sep-19 06:55 PM] Markus#5464
20k kmd on avg for notary nodes per year....thats 1666 on avg per month * 64 so close to 107k per month mined by NN

[01-Sep-19 06:55 PM] Markus#5464
im sure there is more selling then that

[01-Sep-19 06:55 PM] Markus#5464
and probably not everyone sell

[01-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
atomicdex release to public is my hope for KMD to soar

[01-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Neko#5830
how are notaries chosen ?

[01-Sep-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
they airdrop a vote token each year to everyone who owns kmd and u send ur vote token to the persons address u wanna vote on

[01-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Markus#5464
1 kmd = 1 vote

[01-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Neko#5830
hmmm

[01-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Atomicdex will increase brand recognition as well as acting as the most liquid pair

[01-Sep-19 06:58 PM] Markus#5464
dont know if it will be a reason for price to increasse

[01-Sep-19 07:01 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
even chainlink is dropping

[01-Sep-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
sure everything is dropping

[01-Sep-19 07:03 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder how else KMD is going to create demand

[01-Sep-19 07:03 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
dPOW is too few to significantly impact prices

[01-Sep-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
I dont see real reason for price to go up compared to what u can do with kmd

[01-Sep-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
cause there is no real demand for it

[01-Sep-19 07:04 PM] Markus#5464
10% dex fee being only demand beside dpow

[01-Sep-19 07:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
So far there is no real successful use case for blockchain except as cryptocurrency

[01-Sep-19 07:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
But btc had a headstart on that department

[01-Sep-19 07:17 PM] AkiraX#8269
@dan.  how much btch you selling?

[01-Sep-19 07:20 PM] dan.#2473
I'll have to check but it's about 750

[01-Sep-19 07:20 PM] dan.#2473
7xx something

[01-Sep-19 07:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Markus @Gordon Komodo  CCPeg

[01-Sep-19 07:22 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The question is when will CCPeg be actualized and used by majority

[01-Sep-19 07:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The answer is probably Tuesday üòÑ

[01-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I wonder when will binance disburse the staking reward

[01-Sep-19 07:24 PM] Markus#5464
would be better if they didnt it will probably get dumped

[01-Sep-19 07:55 PM] tolken#2655
@Gordon Komodo between now and  5th

[01-Sep-19 08:03 PM] tolken#2655
ccpeg should be pretty sweet.

[01-Sep-19 08:05 PM] tolken#2655
Looking forward to Kmd loans

[01-Sep-19 09:04 PM] Neko#5830
from my cold dead hands

[01-Sep-19 09:29 PM] Markus#5464
next support 5.8k

[01-Sep-19 09:38 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Great to see so much progress in price action since the rebrand

[01-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
not really a collectible, not being used, can't eat em

[01-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
whats the real value?

[01-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
finally approaching that i suppose

[01-Sep-19 10:14 PM] Sdunbar#5064
eventually

[01-Sep-19 11:04 PM] allbits#5898
Ten thousand transactions in the last 24 hours. Which is fairly average recently. Not being used?

[01-Sep-19 11:23 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I would doubt those are to buy things though

[01-Sep-19 11:38 PM] allbits#5898
Oh, you mean you now need to circumscribe your definition of "use" in order to fit your preset narrative? Got it.

[01-Sep-19 11:38 PM] Sdunbar#5064
this is correct

[01-Sep-19 11:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Still my favourite coin though

[01-Sep-19 11:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm not the one dumping

[01-Sep-19 11:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
but honestly this is crypto

[01-Sep-19 11:40 PM] Sdunbar#5064
who knows what will happen

[01-Sep-19 11:54 PM] Tomcat#7863
Any reason why komod making new lows from a f.a stand point or just normal shitcoining?

[01-Sep-19 11:54 PM] Tomcat#7863
I havent been up to news

[01-Sep-19 11:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
it makes little sense. idk why individual buyers would be selling right now.

[01-Sep-19 11:56 PM] Tomcat#7863
Nothing happened t.a wise?

[01-Sep-19 11:56 PM] Tomcat#7863
just market doing its thing?

[02-Sep-19 12:01 AM] actionslacks#4072
My tinfoil hat theory is cex manipulation to hobble atomic dex.

[02-Sep-19 02:31 AM] tolken#2655
Hah. My gut tells me Binance blocking US customers plays a role in current activity. Lots of uncertainty regarding how and where kmd will trade. I suspect we‚Äôll see some interesting activity one the market settles into this new market configuration.

[02-Sep-19 02:32 AM] tolken#2655
Also, dumpers dumping before the 5th KMD 250k dump. Wild times.

[02-Sep-19 02:33 AM] tolken#2655
0.0000777 sure looked better than 0.0000666.

[02-Sep-19 06:33 AM] Markus#5464
1k

[02-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Alexfrog#1338
nope its 0 sorry

[02-Sep-19 07:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no wait, its actually negative, theyll track down and fine people who hold KMD< and you wont be able to give it to anyone else

[02-Sep-19 07:24 AM] Andersen#8337
Market cap is a lie.
Buy support tells the true story.
Buy support rating separates investments from gambles.
