Luckily I did not invest more than I could afford to lose

[11-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
and at this point I've kind of written it off as a total loss anyways

[11-Sep-19 08:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Not really emotion attached to it anymore

binance shutting out US traders has been coming for awhile. once the shut out date passes I would hope that alts will find a bottom

[11-Sep-19 08:15 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
don't invest more than you could afford to lose is just a meme.

[11-Sep-19 08:18 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418

[12-Sep-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
green

[12-Sep-19 08:17 AM] jorian#4555
no volume though

[12-Sep-19 08:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
only 70k

[12-Sep-19 08:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just need to blow past 8k

[12-Sep-19 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
today marks the day of Binance US traders not being able to trade on Binance anymore right?

[12-Sep-19 08:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
who knows, we will just out it in atomicDEX

[12-Sep-19 08:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah

[12-Sep-19 08:20 AM] jorian#4555
noticed KuCoin's coin went up quite a lot lately

[12-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Not really

[12-Sep-19 09:01 AM] Privatoshi#7913
It's down over 30D

[12-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Privatoshi#7913
what's up with DEX?

[12-Sep-19 09:02 AM] Privatoshi#7913
why the higher price?

[12-Sep-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX payouts are revshares from the DEXfees

[12-Sep-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
value in DEX should be -in part- an extrapolation of future expected revenue streams from DEX revshares

[12-Sep-19 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so the more people are bullish on DEX trading volume, the higher dex price

[12-Sep-19 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
also only 1M DEX total supply, everytime 1M USD in trading fees is accumulated, payout to DEX holders in KMD 🙂

[12-Sep-19 09:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, DEX value is somewhat pegged to usd value because of above, so KMD/USD drops, but DEX/USD stays the same -> DEX/KMD goes up

[12-Sep-19 09:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
apart from organic DEX value growth offcourse 🙂

[12-Sep-19 09:29 AM] jorian#4555
DEX future is very promising, hence high price

[12-Sep-19 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
jep

[12-Sep-19 09:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and its always nice to have a revenue generating asset in your portfolio

[12-Sep-19 09:57 AM] Privatoshi#7913
It is, if they give are profitable.

[12-Sep-19 09:58 AM] Privatoshi#7913
It's not hard to come by 7-8% staking returns.

[12-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Privatoshi#7913
But me, I use extra money right now, with Synthetix.

[12-Sep-19 10:02 AM] Tek#5253

[12-Sep-19 10:02 AM] Tek#5253

[12-Sep-19 10:02 AM] Privatoshi#7913
750% collateralization using SNX, recieving 25% sUSD, and collecting weekly rewards from the synthetix exchange

[12-Sep-19 10:03 AM] Privatoshi#7913
they do $4M daily

[12-Sep-19 10:03 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Generated $555k in fees this year

[12-Sep-19 10:06 AM] Privatoshi#7913
I have to stay profitable, to stay in crypto....

[12-Sep-19 10:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
are there thoughts of switching payout threshold of DEX fees to BTC or KMD based payout threshold?
seems a bit aribtray (good for a start) but in the long run a crypto based metric would seem more natural

[12-Sep-19 10:25 AM] willofleo#7505
binance traders could do with atomicdex desktop wallet ,

[12-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Everybody has a phone

[12-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Privatoshi#7913
download an Android emulator

[12-Sep-19 10:27 AM] Privatoshi#7913
BlueStacks or something

[12-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
wouldn't use those bloatware emulators on my wallet

[12-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
they also need good spec pc's with virtualisation enabled

[12-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Oszy#5734
not everyone has that

[12-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Oszy#5734
that's why we have hyperdex  and chainswap for desktop until atomicdex will have a pc version

[12-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Privatoshi#7913
Oh shit, my bad

[12-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Privatoshi#7913
I'm not thinking

[12-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Privatoshi#7913
I'd def use Hyperdex & Chainswap before I even considered using anything else for DEX

[12-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Privatoshi#7913
@Oszy Good catch

[12-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@willofleo you can use @hyperDEX for desktop

[12-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
#dex-hyperdex

[12-Sep-19 10:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or chainswap from #chainmakers

Just in case you guys want to use the latest version

[12-Sep-19 11:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
btw, we are in need of some monetization or some fund raising for keep development going :/

[12-Sep-19 11:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sadly kmd price and funds for development are not in the same tune right now

Issue equity on gui earnings

[12-Sep-19 11:17 AM] Oszy#5734
sell some CHAIN holdings? something thats  both good for funders and you guys

[12-Sep-19 11:20 AM] mobipoi#5774
Create a proposal on a plan which shows how you will create a great gui, market it to attract users and how this will in turn prove profitable for holders of tokens

[12-Sep-19 11:22 AM] willofleo#7505
@Cryptoon  thanks they are not fully released yet and have little volume , it not fully user ready needs more coin addition , most importantly you have the market marker bot api stuff which is not ready ,

[12-Sep-19 12:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers how much do you need?

[12-Sep-19 12:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Create a businessplan that outlines revenue streams and revshares coming from those streams, sell CHAIN, etc

[12-Sep-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we wont promise revshare, sorry

[12-Sep-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that would make us liable and regulated.

[12-Sep-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We just want to do a fund raise with the promise of developing Chainswap further and take it to the next step.

[12-Sep-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We will do listing fees and that sort of think too, but we cant do any revshare since that would make whatever we issue a "security"

[12-Sep-19 01:19 PM] Oszy#5734
then you need dev volunteers or donations, since we can't "invest" in anything

[12-Sep-19 01:22 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah, like a crowdfund for development of the chainswap

$BTCUSD is in a BB Squeeze as are many of the alts. Positive divergences are developing. Awaiting confirmation of a move higher.
