the twin gemini says if 15k breaks, it will go straight to 20k 😄

[26-Jun-19 06:38 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Tek#5253
10k daily candle

[26-Jun-19 06:40 PM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810

[26-Jun-19 06:47 PM] LocoMB#8593

[26-Jun-19 07:00 PM] alen#3721
If btc breaka 15k its gonna be allover on media...frenzy will begin

[26-Jun-19 07:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that will lead to real FOMO

[26-Jun-19 07:00 PM] Tek#5253
i think they will only start talkin bout it again at $50k or so

[26-Jun-19 07:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and when every new Joe will want to get a slice of it on FOMO, that'd be time to sell

[26-Jun-19 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
very surprised media didnt go crazy at 10k

[26-Jun-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if the BTC is being withdrawn, that matches the institutions accumulating theory

[26-Jun-19 07:04 PM] Caglio#3337

[26-Jun-19 07:04 PM] phm87#7395

[26-Jun-19 07:04 PM] phm87#7395
Institutionnal fomo I think

[26-Jun-19 07:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mark81 it seems only the fiatbot is selling and doesnt have much inventory

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is institutional fomo, 2017/2018 will be a small blip

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] Bittersweet#9376
What's the point of a fiat bit?

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] Markus#5464
but why would institutions fomo, are they not all about smart money and being infront of the game? u would think they would want it cheap not on this prices when they had plenty of opportunities on way lower prices

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] allbits#5898
Real institutional fomo is still some ways off in the future

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] Mark81#4505
there we just a moment ago at 15ksats roghly 88k kmd offer but its gone now

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
institutions are pack animals

[26-Jun-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but some in the pack want to be a bit ahead of the rest

[26-Jun-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
fiatbot purpose is to demoralize and lower the price to accumulate at below normal prices. seems it is being quite effective

[26-Jun-19 07:06 PM] allbits#5898
This is more like forward thinking asset allocators (hedge funds, family offices). Those that have less red tape to work through

[26-Jun-19 07:06 PM] Bittersweet#9376
well that's counting on the fact that crushing the price

@actionslacks just saw a regular BTC podcast where the guy discussed chainanalyses-
seems an ex-employee made a reddit AMA and spilled the beans on how creepy that tool already is, and how totally useless against .. many privacy coins..

[26-Jun-19 07:33 PM] Markus#5464
