If you give a man a trade he will eat for a month.

@jl777c true, market seems to hate good tech and float toward cheap gimmicks like tron

[31-Jul-19 06:39 PM] Markus#5464
17. This obscured Liquid CT chain can enable exchanges to move funds without alerting the public or regulators to what is happening. They can also move these funds in the form of a liquid stablecoin. It could even obscure new Tether treasury issuance's from being made public. But not only that, as an issuer you could probably optionally reveal such issuance's to the public on the blockchain.

thoughts?

[31-Jul-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the public doesnt know as it is a private chain, but certainly there are not so many tx on it that you can figure out who is doing what

[31-Jul-19 06:41 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

jl777 implemented `-ac_adaptivepow` 2 days ago https://medium.com/@jameslee777/adaptivepow-the-solution-to-diff-stranding-of-smaller-blockchains-425609df5563
We are testing high hashrate attack on Komodo assetchains in #talk-mining channel. This hashrate attack will run for 30 mins max and diff will be very high. Then, we will stop all ASIC mining and use only 1 CPU thread to continue mining which will bring the diff down and the chain will not be stranded. This test will start at 8PM UTC today which is about 5 mis away.
You can keep an eye on the stats here http://178.159.11.114:8080/stats
If you want to help and have ASIC or hashpower, please point at stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3033
