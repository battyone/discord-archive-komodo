[12-Feb-19 02:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone looked at Maramara lately?  Love the project.

[12-Feb-19 02:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This thinking... wonder if our tx/s could compare with Ripple labs?   

We could convince them to move to Komodo and rename K-Ripple.

[12-Feb-19 02:17 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Anyone know what's happening with KMD/USD (bittrex) on tradingview? I assume it's because  they added their own trading pair, but both bittrext and calculated by tradingview show only recent history. missing out all the months before

[12-Feb-19 02:18 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Or how to fix the display?

Me too @ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ 

I think theyre testing now. üëç

[12-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@FishyGuts our tx/s is higher than ripples'

[12-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
even with small scale test

[12-Feb-19 02:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but have to check with @blackjok3r for the details

[12-Feb-19 02:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@bpkdasbaum   Probably due to it not existing in the time you were trying to see.

[12-Feb-19 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@bpkdasbaum bittrex KMD/USD has only been open a few days, there are no "months" *to* show

[12-Feb-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Our Tx/s ecosystem wide is unlimited..... I think LABS which is the ony real blockchain using MoMoM tech will beat ripple at launch... If we fiull all chains blocks at the same time. üòÑ

[12-Feb-19 02:23 PM] ph03nix#3115
@bpkdasbaum you have to change it to "kmd/usd (calculated by trading view)"

[12-Feb-19 02:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
the werid thing is, it does not switch, when i select "calculated by tradingview". it will load some of my old drawings, but only for the last 3 weeks fo data, which is the same time bittrex launched their new kmd/usd pair

[12-Feb-19 02:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it both loads the same chart for me

[12-Feb-19 02:31 PM] ph03nix#3115
yes, same here, binance goes back further

[12-Feb-19 02:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
well, thanks anyway, guess I have to deal with the loss of the chart and move on.

[12-Feb-19 02:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
maybe it will get fixed in the futre.

$KMD #KOMODO

Unfortunately dropped a bit further, however double bottom & support found at the 0.618-0.65 region & S/R flip there.

Breakout upwards.
Tested upper resistance 4 times.
Expecting to break out upwards now.
Next zone is 32-34K area.

$KMD has been in what seems to be an accumulation range for the last 200+ days. I think it is getting close to a breakout. Expecting a chain reaction that will lead to an impulsive move after the red block on 4H time frame is reclaimed.

$KMD likes to move fast. Given the current market conditions we might not get the same surge in price, but I think it will have a nice run nonetheless.

It was always like this in this bear market, expect the times when whales showed up. Most of buying and selling is spot..

@FishyGuts WhaleBro first appeared September 2nd with a 350 BTC order priced at .00018BTC for 556,090k KMD.  That's the first record I have of it's presence. Who knows how many additional times that buy has been in and out with smaller  orders.

I went in on some more KMD.   Honestly... at 2K sats / 80 cents.... I can't imagine the number of people kicking themselves when its $10 again.    Ididn't wanna be one of those people.
