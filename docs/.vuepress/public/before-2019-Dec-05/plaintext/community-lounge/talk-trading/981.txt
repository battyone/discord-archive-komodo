@allbits there is 2 of you in this channel for some reason. The whales have more information. If they are going to dump 20k BTC on bitstamp to get it to 5k, they think that is what will happen, but the market could just bid it all the way back in an hour. So yes that dont hae 100% certainty that things will go the way they have planned, they have a better chance of achieving their goals.

[30-Jul-19 03:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is all about variance, most of the time they will get what they want but there will be a % of the time they lose money. If it is +EV for them to move the market they will.

[30-Jul-19 04:00 AM] allbits#5898
That is well known not to be true in any reasonably liquid market like btc.  The only place it's true is micro cap.  This is settled fact for decades, and nothing has changed to alter that reality.  Only amateur traders believe otherwise.

[30-Jul-19 04:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If 5000BTC can dump on bitstamp and cause bitmex price to go down, that is not a liquid market

[30-Jul-19 04:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The liquidity in BTC is segmented. There is not global orderbook, so the liquidity is a illusion

[30-Jul-19 04:09 AM] allbits#5898
People find it easier and more palatable to believe in cartoon versions of reality, like whale games, or vast political/banking conspiracies controlling all events. The actual reality of vast, indescribable complexity in social systems such as markets is a more difficult story to tell and to comprehend.

[30-Jul-19 04:11 AM] allbits#5898
That single bitmex event actually proves the point. It had no effect beyond a blip. And it was certainly beyond the control of even the person who conducted the operation. He knew neither the extent of the outcome not its follow on.

[30-Jul-19 04:11 AM] allbits#5898
The BTC market is very liquid

[30-Jul-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not on individual exchanges

[30-Jul-19 04:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Look at the CA/BTC pair what they took it down to 1000 or something recently

[30-Jul-19 04:12 AM] allbits#5898
So?

[30-Jul-19 04:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The bigger the amounts they can use the higher the % of success for them

[30-Jul-19 04:13 AM] allbits#5898
What success? They can't predict the outcome of their operation nor guarantee any profit from it

[30-Jul-19 04:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Why cant they predict the outcome?

[30-Jul-19 04:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If someone dumps 100,000 BTC on 1 exchange, they cannot predict what will happen? Especially when it would cause the spot price on bitmex the most liquid exchange in the world to drop thousands of basis points?

[30-Jul-19 04:14 AM] allbits#5898
They can only guess. They don't know what will happen next. And such events are  rare.

[30-Jul-19 04:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It might be for a short period of time, sure.

[30-Jul-19 04:15 AM] allbits#5898
Point to the  100000 btc example please

[30-Jul-19 04:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Come on, too many assumptions here.

[30-Jul-19 04:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Recently there was a 5000 dump right? BTC dumped 1-2k pretty much instantly on bitmex, 80M liquidated

[30-Jul-19 04:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You said they cannot know the outcome, i am giving you a scenario where they can.

[30-Jul-19 04:16 AM] allbits#5898
You haven't proved they knew the outcome before the operation

[30-Jul-19 04:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
100 BTC dump, probably fail
1000BTC probably fail
10000 BTC - chances are higher
100000 BTC nearly 100% cause the price to fall

[30-Jul-19 04:17 AM] allbits#5898
Where's the profit in that?

[30-Jul-19 04:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If satoshi decided to dump his 1M bitcoin, he doesnt know the outcome?

[30-Jul-19 04:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They short the hell out of BTC

[30-Jul-19 04:17 AM] allbits#5898
Correct

[30-Jul-19 04:17 AM] allbits#5898
He doesn't know the outcome

[30-Jul-19 04:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We can agree to disagree.

[30-Jul-19 04:18 AM] allbits#5898
You haven't described a route to profit from these operations

[30-Jul-19 04:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You assume that BTC is a liquid market, it is not.

[30-Jul-19 04:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Short 100x Bitmex and other exchanges, dump, cause spot price to go down, cashout.

[30-Jul-19 04:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Buy back the BTC lower

[30-Jul-19 04:19 AM] allbits#5898
You haven't shown that they would know the outcome other than "it would fall". How much? For how long?

[30-Jul-19 04:19 AM] allbits#5898
They might have lost their shirts. You have no idea

[30-Jul-19 04:20 AM] allbits#5898
It certainly hasn't been repeated often

[30-Jul-19 04:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But how do you know

[30-Jul-19 04:20 AM] allbits#5898
I think that's a cartoon description you put forward. Very simplified version of reality

[30-Jul-19 04:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think you are over complicating peoples need to be greedy.

[30-Jul-19 04:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You assume that BTC is a liquid market, it is not.

[30-Jul-19 04:21 AM] allbits#5898
There's plenty of books on the topic since the early 20th century

[30-Jul-19 04:21 AM] allbits#5898
It is highly liquid

[30-Jul-19 04:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Cool please prove a reference to bitcoin in those books for me

[30-Jul-19 04:22 AM] allbits#5898
There are many, many large playerscompeting to fleece each other. That creates incomprehensible complexity

The biggest fraud on the planet?
THE Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has sued 16 big banks that set a key global interest rate, accusing them of fraud and conspiring to keep the rate low to enrich themselves.

Bitcoin is a financial market like any other. Come on now

They had no serious impact on rates if you dig into that story beyond the headlines

The Jig Is Up: Big Banks Rigged the Silver Price Fix
It has now been proven that big banks had the “fix in” when it came to the daily silver price fix, which is historically set by the London Market Bullion Association, over the past several years. While details are still yet to come, it was recently announced that troubled...

You cannot have it both ways.

[30-Jul-19 04:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If people can make money manipulating prices they will.

[30-Jul-19 04:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is just part of human nature, the need for greed.

[30-Jul-19 04:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
These 2 issues happened under the watchful eyes of the gov, BTC doesnt even have that over sight.

[30-Jul-19 04:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You said there are many players, how do you know they are competing with each other? Their goal would be to make money, teaming up and moving the markets on multiple exchanges as a group would amplify the effects and give them a higher % of success.

[30-Jul-19 04:30 AM] allbits#5898
Yes, people attempt to manipulate free markets. But they don't succeed in open and free markets - it requires collusion, and best with s limited number of permitted players. Just like the LIBOR case. That's super far from the btc market reality. There, you have many, many large players competing to fleece each other. Hence, incomprehensible complexity

[30-Jul-19 04:31 AM] allbits#5898
Now you've gone from "whale games" to a vast collusion conspiracy. That's a good cartoon!

[30-Jul-19 04:33 AM] allbits#5898
Across multiple exchanges too!

[30-Jul-19 04:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You are assuming things that you cannot prove

[30-Jul-19 04:33 AM] allbits#5898
I think you are

[30-Jul-19 04:33 AM] allbits#5898
Actually

[30-Jul-19 04:34 AM] allbits#5898
I'm just parroting settled understanding of complex free markets

[30-Jul-19 04:36 AM] allbits#5898
Something which isn't exciting for the amateur traders of crypto land. Who prefer the excitement of easy to understand whale game cartoons.

For what it's worth I agree with you that every market is characterized by attempted manipulation. It's hardly ever successful it seems, except in cases with specialized facts.

I can personally bump up the price of kmd right now with a few thousand dollars. It used to be much easier. But to say that there is some macroeconomic entropy protecting the btc market from manipulation... I think you need to look at the sheer amount of power some of the whales have now.   Manipulation happens everyday in this market. It's routine and more often than not I personally believe it is successful at getting whatever albeit temporary effect is sought with the price.

12k btc inc

[30-Jul-19 05:25 AM] Markus#5464
might go to 12k and then dump again just to create a lower high

[30-Jul-19 05:51 AM] allbits#5898
You THINK you can bump the KMD price right now for a few thousand dollars. It might turn out not to be true if, for example, I was simultaneously attempting to lower it with a few more thoudabd dollars than you.. You don't know how high you would push it with any reasonable accuracy, nor how long it would stay up, nor where it might settle after your operation. You would be guessing all these things and there would be a huge margin for error. You would have no certain path to profit from such an operation. These are my points. Understand yet?

I agree there is ATTEMPTED manipulation in all markets. But the larger the market, the more complex it is, the more number of players there are competing to fleece each other, and the less likely any attempted manipulation can be successful in achieving its goal of profit, unless there is wide ranging collusion of a substantial number of the largest players.  Again, I am parroting settled market theory here. I.do understand that it's just conceptually simpler, and more cinematic, to think that individual minds are pulling all the strings on markets. It's a common misconception of uniformed market observers.
