Recession is almost a definite for the U.S. and with the globalization of the market due to the ever more connected populaces. This means a recession for everyone hopefully Greece doesn't take a shit again :X.

[31-Mar-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think Italy is a bigger problem than Greece tbh

[31-Mar-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362

@dukeleto it seems like they will start trading in bittrex with their ieo, dont think they are listed on any exchange yet

In my book, this weekly 8/41 ema crossover is the "sell your house and wife and go all in" moment.

This circle is the last point of resistance in the historical chart. This will take some time to become support and will make price move slow until it gains territory.

But once this is broken and becomes support, moon will be next stop.

[01-Apr-19 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if you notice this is the area this last fat finger pump touched and got whacked like a mole

[01-Apr-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@siu - Chainmakers i don't even have a bittrex account, lol

[01-Apr-19 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
i only heard of VBK from my FPGA mining calculator, i missed the hype train

[01-Apr-19 12:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
its easy. you just need to give them you ass stamp and a little DNA test and you can trade there üòÇ

[01-Apr-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not a trader, this is not trading advice. But VBK gonna dump hard

[01-Apr-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
A KYC-only IEO, what will they think of next

[01-Apr-19 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
it may have quite a pump before it dumps, tho. Depends on how impatient FPGA miners are

[01-Apr-19 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
a $3000 FPGA miner can get $17/day profit on VBK right now, and a lot of miners want to hit that glorious breakeven

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
so it will be FPGA miners dumping against the pumpers

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
who is selling the coins in the IEO then? that is the real dumper

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can KYC your coins, or you can mine them with GPU or FPGA

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
lots of investors bought at 5 cents

[01-Apr-19 12:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
miners gonna mine, and miners gonna dump

[01-Apr-19 12:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
that calculator assumes the opening price of 10 cents, take with a large grain of salt. But many miners take calculators as the word of Satoshi and will mine a bunch of VBK and try to unload it

[01-Apr-19 12:48 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i am confused
