[26-Jun-19 03:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Non-sourced bitcoins are now illegal

.00001 btc in your wallet has been traced back to a terrorist anti kyc organization. door kicking flash bangers are en route to your current coordinates.

back in 2017, kmd was bleeding during 2 months before spiking to its ATH. It's possible that the same thing will happen again

[26-Jun-19 04:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
a bit sad because KMD is currently out of top 60 though ðŸ˜‚
