I have not given presentations here in NZ for good amount of time. 
May be I'll demonstration atomicDEX when it's public

[22-Jun-19 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is called community contribution

[22-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
If I‚Äôll be able to easily trade mobile

[22-Jun-19 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nobody holds you from doing that

[22-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Tek#5253
instead of bitcoin bull news im now getting bombaredd with "altmarket about to explode " news

[22-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
And that happens to be on DEX

[22-Jun-19 08:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ANYONE can do it.

[22-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Malti#3948
Then boom, use case right there

[22-Jun-19 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

It's infant

[22-Jun-19 08:49 AM] Malti#3948

[22-Jun-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
meantime, BTC making a second run at 11k

[22-Jun-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
10.8

[22-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Malti#3948
If y‚Äôall want marketing, look no further than PIRATE today.

[22-Jun-19 08:50 AM] Voight#4922
isnt there any non erc20 pegged coin?

[22-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Malti#3948
For kmd, come back 15th of July

[22-Jun-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i think tether made EOS variant

[22-Jun-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and original tether was on some offbeat thing

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
facebook coin!

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
we are also testing commandline configuable pegs

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
aha... the rollercoaster up again!

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
set the fiat you want to peg to, set the crypto you want to back it with

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if 11k is breached ...

[22-Jun-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
another 10% up for BTC, alts 10% down in BTC terms

[22-Jun-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the saying "no pain, no gain" applies. the more pain from BTC rising, the more gains will be later

[22-Jun-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
just stay calm

[22-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Malti#3948
Advanced AI has spoken

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
just bull stampedes are normal

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
jl is pretty trusttworthy in his predictions

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and unpredictable in the details

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
he said to hold when it seemed to make tops at 8k

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
now here we are at 11k

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i say hold until it drops 50% from its peak

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
20% to 25% corrections will happen

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
thats caputilation

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
ok

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
got it

[22-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Tek#5253
bear market signal*

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
shame to get out of the market at 23%, then it goes to ATH again

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, make two trades per cycle (ideally)

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
from bull -> bear, dropping below 50% is pretty clear indication

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
from bear -> bull, doubling from low is pretty clear signal

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] Malti#3948
What do you mean?

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not much fun, much waiting, maybe years

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] Malti#3948
Losing 50% value

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] Malti#3948
Only sell then?

[22-Jun-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
in the last cycle, it peaked at 20k, so you sell when it went below 10k

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Tek#5253
bro I like waiting. I can garden, meditate, practise my astral skills.

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] D3b0#9761
Waves has DEX desktop and DEX mobile almost 2 years,  why you think our DEX will be beter?

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then you bought back at 6k, when it doubled the bear market low

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Malti#3948
Profitable trade indeed

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
very boring, but much lower risk. you almost double the crypto you have, and capture 50% of ATH

[22-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Malti#3948
Got it. Thx jl

[22-Jun-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 50% is extreme, you just dont want to be shaken out too early from the rollercoaster

[22-Jun-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be 60% or even 65%, but when it was 13k, was it really impossible for it to get back to 20k?

[22-Jun-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
at 50%, it seems you need to go through a bear cycle

[22-Jun-19 08:57 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Yo JL777c, dont feel the need to give everybody a reply. Relax and enjoy the weekend (and enjoy seeing the KMD fund grow as you guys got a decent amount of BTC).

[22-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Waves dex is proxy token isn‚Äôt it?

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@D3b0  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a real dex

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@D3b0 NXT had a proxy token dex 5 years ago

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i pioneered the entire proxy token trading with MGW

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@D3b0 Waves DEX is cool. Improved DEX tech based on SuperNET's MultiGateWay Proxy Token based DEX.
Atomic Swaps is NOT equals to Proxy Token based DEX.

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not licensing compliant as near as i can tell, also you are trusting the gateway with your funds

[22-Jun-19 08:58 AM] D3b0#9761
nice answers,thanks

[22-Jun-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
also, mobile trading!

[22-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Waves dex is nice user friendliness is also good and getting better... Erc 20 comming soon

[22-Jun-19 09:03 AM] D3b0#9761
yes,its very user friendly, i folow waves but KMD is much better tech
i hope our DEX will be also user friendly

[22-Jun-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is!

PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLS

[22-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC has to retrace to 10k and retest

[22-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i think until that happens, traders wait for possible breakout to 15k

[22-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the stampede back into alts will be fun to watch

[22-Jun-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
whenever it happens

[22-Jun-19 09:08 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Also i like how jl is interacting with the community. You don't hear Sasha anymore.

[22-Jun-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i am spending time just dealing with refunds and helping the other devs, cant really go into deep coding when in this mode, so i have time to chat

[22-Jun-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the team is doing great as i was saturated with hack issues for a couple weeks, but releases were made, progress all around. not that visible externally, but internally. some growing pains integrating in the new NN, but season 3 starts in july so a lot of work to get things all setup for that

[22-Jun-19 09:12 AM] kaks#6612
i think btc will retest 9k lvl

[22-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i predict 10k will be support

[22-Jun-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if not... maybe this is a big giant bull trap

[22-Jun-19 09:13 AM] kaks#6612
almost in weekends going bullish

[22-Jun-19 09:14 AM] kaks#6612
wait for the corrections on tuesday

[22-Jun-19 09:15 AM] D3b0#9761
@Sherdogz yes,after may 2017 Sasha is untochable but

[22-Jun-19 09:15 AM] kaks#6612
more it goes high now there will be a huge correction

[22-Jun-19 09:15 AM] kaks#6612
many ppl gonna get rekt

[22-Jun-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
for the ones that bought at 6k and waiting for -50% from highs, this is all just an interesting thing to watch

[22-Jun-19 09:16 AM] kaks#6612
i see a btc trader get rekt on live stream üòÇ

[22-Jun-19 09:16 AM] kaks#6612

[22-Jun-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
when all the waterskiers fall into the water as the boat speeds ahead... dont rely on the order they fell into the water, it is all random chaos

[22-Jun-19 09:18 AM] Oszy#5734
funny enough during this bull run i dont have any btc üòâ don't care :p

[22-Jun-19 09:18 AM] kaks#6612

[22-Jun-19 09:18 AM] kaks#6612
only kmd and ARRR

[22-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Mische#6695
Thinking about trading my arrr into KMD as it seems likely that KMD reached its bottom
