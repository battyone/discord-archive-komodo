so yeah, lending is pretty much free :p

[13-Sep-19 12:45 PM] mobipoi#5774
Yes however it due to market valuing such as in would rather buy bonds

[13-Sep-19 12:45 PM] mobipoi#5774
Much safer that money Market

[13-Sep-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
by taking out the loan, your collateral is at risk of being liquidated. but the stablecoins that you got, those are yours to trade freely

[13-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bonds are the next catastrophic event IMO

[13-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bond price is invertly correlated with intrest rates. It is why central banks are keeping intrest rates low, once they start rising bond market will collapse, and collapse of all pension funds etc are next 🙂

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
P=1/r

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
or whatever the exact formula was

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] mobipoi#5774
Ok so loan is valued below collateral

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] mobipoi#5774
At what ratio

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
user determines what ratio, anything up to 80%

[13-Sep-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah, if you take into account how badly some euro countries (but US as well) are doing, and yet they can still borrow money dirt cheap, this is a thing that cannot last forever

[13-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so (imo) systemic risk is huge atm, and thus low intrest rates are 'needed' to keep the system going

[13-Sep-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
of course if you take out 80%, then a 20% drop in price and you are liquidated. actually a bit before that. so the liquidators have a built in arbitrage

[13-Sep-19 12:48 PM] jorian#4555
why not? just print more money

[13-Sep-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
a 24 hour average price is used for settlements , so short term fluctuations wont cause liquidations

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
interest rates are negative now

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
you get paid to lend money @Cryptoon

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Tek#5253
the ECB will pay you to lend money

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can buy a 400k house, put nothing down and they just take a mortgage on the newly bought house. Problem is house market is pumped because of ultra low intrest rates. So if intrest rates rise, housing market will drop, causing the collateral to be worth less etc

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Big problem in Belgium for example

[13-Sep-19 12:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I know @Tek it's what I was saying above

[13-Sep-19 12:50 PM] mobipoi#5774
Get a 30 year fixed rate

[13-Sep-19 12:50 PM] mobipoi#5774
Done

[13-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Tek#5253
only house loans are interested. I wanted to buy a piece of farm land

[13-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Tek#5253
no interesting loan rates there

[13-Sep-19 12:50 PM] Tek#5253
only if you want to buy a house

[13-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
in other words, only if you want to commit to slaving  30 years to pay your house loan

[13-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
is when they will provide cheap loan

[13-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
fuck that

[13-Sep-19 12:51 PM] Tek#5253
>> taking a loan

[13-Sep-19 12:52 PM] mobipoi#5774
@jl777c so which entity benefit from the arbitrage or liquidation

[13-Sep-19 12:52 PM] mobipoi#5774
Will it be all smart contract based defi as they call it

[13-Sep-19 12:53 PM] mobipoi#5774
You can always sell the house

[13-Sep-19 12:53 PM] mobipoi#5774
Collect equity

[13-Sep-19 12:55 PM] mobipoi#5774
But a farm is smart too depends on it grade 1 or 2 are good also how close to a water source it is

[13-Sep-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can lock their KMD and issue new stablecoins, so the coin issuance is fully decentralized

[13-Sep-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
similarily, anybody can liquidate accounts that have too little equity left

[13-Sep-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
all enforced by blockchain

[13-Sep-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
the locked KMD itself goes into a large multisig (7 of 13), running on the top notary nodes with an automatic withdraw processing. all the deposit side is fully automated by the blockchain based on user transactions

[13-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@mobipoi @Tek banks typically dont give out 30year loans anymore, 25y is max.

[13-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Banks will only do 30 years if they will know that after 5y you will get a big payout that will allow you to refinance to a shorter term

[13-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
eg people that have a company and expect to sell in x years, the bank will say ok low annuity for now, but once you get paid, refinance

[13-Sep-19 12:59 PM] allbits#5898
Take the macro economics talk to off topic so you're not interrupting the lead devs technical discussions jeez

[13-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Tek#5253
its trading

[13-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was fired up by my macro economic views :p

[13-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Tek#5253
@allbits asskisser

[13-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[13-Sep-19 01:00 PM] allbits#5898
You guys are utterly untrained. Your opinions on these matters mean nothing

[13-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
Your opinion also means nothing

[13-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Tek#5253
asskissboi

[13-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@allbits it's not an opinion, I try to explain what is going on and what I think will happen so people can think about it as well and adjust trading strategies accordingly

[13-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
also, there are two allbits on the server, one is an imposter? @allbits @allbits

[13-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
theory says you should go cash, but given the expansion in monetary policy cash is also a bad choice

[13-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
question is what btc will do in such an event

[13-Sep-19 01:02 PM] JimD#9272
BTC seems like a strong bet

[13-Sep-19 01:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
we havent experienced BTC with the economy in a downturn

[13-Sep-19 01:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think initially it will go down together, after BTC recovering faster?

[13-Sep-19 01:03 PM] JimD#9272
unless they outright ban it I think it will do well

[13-Sep-19 01:03 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, until the old paradigm is shattered then people will look for alternative and I think BTC will be one

[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] JimD#9272
The goal of a recession is to drop asset prices super low and scoop them all up

[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] JimD#9272
so you have to figure out a way to preserve capital on the way down

[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] JimD#9272
good luck doing that though

[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gold maybe? but has been pumping a lot already

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if one could store water without it going bad? :p

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] JimD#9272
I think commodities will do well

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
commodities move with the economy, no?

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] JimD#9272
if things get bad enough food water and bullets will be the currency 😉

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
water and bullets indeed

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] JimD#9272
I think they will at first

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
people need to drink 😄

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] JimD#9272
There is jut too much debt in the system right now

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and need to do school shootings

👌 

[13-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
(sorry maybe bit too dark)

[13-Sep-19 01:06 PM] JimD#9272
I think there will be a fiat holocaust

[13-Sep-19 01:06 PM] JimD#9272
Im betting on BTC TBH

[13-Sep-19 01:07 PM] JimD#9272
Satoshi will save me from the excesses of the ruling class

[13-Sep-19 01:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I also like jl to be a safe bet 🙂

[13-Sep-19 01:08 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, I got plenty of KMD on the side

[13-Sep-19 01:08 PM] JimD#9272
BTC and KMD play together

[13-Sep-19 01:44 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c how would the kmd loan towards stable coins be calculated?

[13-Sep-19 01:44 PM] Markus#5464
Can it be used to gain more kmd?

[13-Sep-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
If kmd price is 2$ and i have 10k kmd, thats 20k, if kmd price decrease to 1$ will i now be able to get 20k kmd from the loan swap?

[13-Sep-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
liquidators are converting the stablecoins back to KMD

[13-Sep-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can predict the prices accurately, you would be able to trade against the blockchain and make money

[13-Sep-19 01:47 PM] Markus#5464
Alright thats cool

[13-Sep-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
this provides the liquidity to people

[13-Sep-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and liquidators are set to get 5% in arbitrage, so there should be an active set of liquidators

[13-Sep-19 01:48 PM] Markus#5464
When u return the USDK are they getting burned?

[13-Sep-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Sep-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
deposit KMD and borrow stable coins against that collateral

[13-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
pay back a loan and the stablecoins are converted back into KMD

[13-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all using the DTO (decentralized trustless oracle)

[13-Sep-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
for prices

[13-Sep-19 01:49 PM] Markus#5464
will there be a swap fee?

[13-Sep-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
transaction fees and there is some percentage on liquidation that goes into the system

[13-Sep-19 01:51 PM] Markus#5464
Also will there be only kmd loans or are u able to loan other coins aswell towards USDK?

[13-Sep-19 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
we havent finalized all the exact fees

[13-Sep-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD works very good for the coin to use as there needs to be a multisig signers for the withdraws and using KMD, they can earn the rewards. for other coins, there is no financial incentive for the multisig signers

[13-Sep-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
technically it is possible to use any BTC protocol coin and also to be a stablecoin for any fiat
