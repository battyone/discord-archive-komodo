[15-May-19 07:02 PM] LocoMB#8593

KMD bots are the weakest holders

[15-May-19 07:46 PM] Markus#5464
its btc not binances fault

[15-May-19 07:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but for last hour I have 0 confirmations`
If it's KMD, then you gotta wait a few hrs anyway

[15-May-19 07:46 PM] Caglio#3337
BTC fault is cos I cannot withdraw my KMD ? And usually I see my KMD in agama after a minute or 2

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
Its deposit which makes it 2 hours transfer

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
oh, taking out

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] Markus#5464
u said 0 conf, that being said i assumed u sent something not trying to withdraw

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] Caglio#3337
I am trying to withdraw for a while, and in withdrawal history says 0 confirmations, for more than an hour now

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] nocturnal#2177

[15-May-19 07:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[15-May-19 07:49 PM] Caglio#3337
I guess there should be one

[15-May-19 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_goes back to hammering nails_

[15-May-19 07:52 PM] Caglio#3337
anyway, on withdrawal page, there is no TXID, it says confiming 0/120

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
Stupid Binance

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
there should be txid somewhere in history

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
there is not

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
if you put that into te block explorer

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
in every other process I did before

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
you will get some clues

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean every other withdrawal in history has a txid

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] Caglio#3337
This one doesnt have any

[15-May-19 07:53 PM] nocturnal#2177
then it hasnt happened

[15-May-19 07:54 PM] nocturnal#2177
(or you havent found it)

[15-May-19 07:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Still I do not have them able to trade

[15-May-19 07:54 PM] Caglio#3337
Is there some time limit for a withdrawal to become a failure ?

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] nocturnal#2177
does your balance still show the same?

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] Caglio#3337
However it seems like it is in "limbo" mode

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] nocturnal#2177

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] nocturnal#2177

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] nocturnal#2177

[15-May-19 07:55 PM] Caglio#3337
But oki 😄

[15-May-19 07:56 PM] nocturnal#2177
worth a try 😃

[15-May-19 07:57 PM] Caglio#3337
yeah but, it wont change it... I guess they have some time limit

[15-May-19 07:57 PM] Caglio#3337
After which one those kind of stuff goes back to normal

[15-May-19 07:57 PM] Caglio#3337
or whatever

[15-May-19 07:58 PM] nocturnal#2177
if your balance is still there cant just send it again?

[15-May-19 07:58 PM] Caglio#3337
Nope I cannot

[15-May-19 07:58 PM] Caglio#3337
It shows my balance, but in limbo

[15-May-19 07:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
what do you mean in limbo?

[15-May-19 07:59 PM] nocturnal#2177
it says 'in limbo' ?

[15-May-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
No it does not say that

[15-May-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
But when I go to withdrawal

[15-May-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
I see 0 komodo left

[15-May-19 08:00 PM] Caglio#3337
cos all komodo I had are supposed to be withdrawn

[15-May-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Yet, it shows me balance of Komodo

[15-May-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Because its still 0/120 confirmations

[15-May-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
So, there is nothing to withdraw

[15-May-19 08:01 PM] Caglio#3337
But those funds Im trying to withdraw are shown in my wallet

[15-May-19 08:02 PM] Caglio#3337

[15-May-19 08:03 PM] Caglio#3337

Things looking good for litecoin, 20 ma crossing 50 ma on weekly chart LTC/USD

[15-May-19 10:43 PM] srgess#8462
Hey why almost all coin pumping to +20% and komodo not ?

[15-May-19 10:44 PM] Alecandro#1179
because the dragon moves when it's ready, not because alt season told it to
