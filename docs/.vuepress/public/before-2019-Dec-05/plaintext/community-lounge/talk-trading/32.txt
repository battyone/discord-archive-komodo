"Today's forecast is suck, followed by more suck tonight, with a continuing chance of suck through the weekend"

[28-Jun-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just gotta leverage it

[28-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Stick your dick in there

[28-Jun-18 03:54 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

KMD is listed on coinexchange, that is one of the reasons for choosing coinexchange as KMD holders are used to this exchange.

[28-Jun-18 05:12 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Sri what did they run to get listed?

[28-Jun-18 05:12 PM] Sri#6686
Dint get you lumbi

[28-Jun-18 05:13 PM] Lumbi#8378
@Sri what was their asking price for listing?

[28-Jun-18 05:13 PM] Sri#6686
aaah 4 BTC, negotiated a bit

[28-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Lumbi#8378

[28-Jun-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You spent 4 BTC to get listed on an exchange that is notorious for poor UTXO handling? WOW!

[28-Jun-18 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
That's what I call commitment to making your project succeed.

[28-Jun-18 05:28 PM] cah5896#7669
This market is getting eerily similar to 2014 to me. I reluctantly sold some KMD today. People are way too bullish on Bitcoin still, with mainstream media still giving favorable attention. Not until there's blood on the streets and "bitcoin is dead" will it be safe again. $2000-3000 for Bitcoin and $0.40-0.70 for KMD. 2014-15 is still too fresh in my mind, but I suppose it could moon next week now that I sold üòÇ

[28-Jun-18 05:29 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"bitcoin is dead" has been the rallying cry at least a dozen times since 2014 üòõ

Top 10 exchanges wants 25 BTC to get listed, do you know that?

[28-Jun-18 06:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@cah5896 ‚Äú20‚Äù is about the only thing 2014 and 2018 have in common imo

[28-Jun-18 06:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought bittrex was free

[28-Jun-18 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what about "201"

[28-Jun-18 06:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure if they still qualify as top10 though

[28-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c got me there

[28-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Sri#6686
Yes, bittrex is free

[28-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Sri#6686
They are in 20 - 30 rankings now

[28-Jun-18 06:09 PM] Sri#6686
But, exchange rankings change every day though

[28-Jun-18 06:09 PM] jl777c#5810

[28-Jun-18 06:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

top 50 would need like daily volume of 16Mill

[28-Jun-18 06:23 PM] Sri#6686

[28-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well, leaders of DEX!

[28-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Spin that shit

[28-Jun-18 06:28 PM] Jazzy#0001
I feel like Waves, Ethfinex or IDEX probably have a larger stake to the claim

[28-Jun-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
for atomic swap DEX to compete volume wise with proxytoken DEX will take a bit more time

{Reactions}

[28-Jun-18 06:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but when I want to swap 60BTC, barterDEX works just fine

[28-Jun-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that is just me and when there are doezens or hundreds like me, then the daily volumes will be a lot higher

[28-Jun-18 06:30 PM] jl777c#5810
or someone could  just do $10 mil per day is wash trading

[28-Jun-18 06:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Still have 10btc left to buy?

[28-Jun-18 06:31 PM] Sri#6686
I heard, there is a concept called Quant Trading JL

[28-Jun-18 06:31 PM] jl777c#5810
a few large BTC atomic swaps is all it would take

[28-Jun-18 06:31 PM] Sri#6686
These are the laundry folks washing

https://cryptoslate.com/cnbcs-brian-kelly-bitcoin-will-resurrect/amp/ is an example of mainstream media positivity. I feel like "bitcoin is dead" people have mostly been fringe CEOs that know nothing about the technology lately and not journalists and large media outlets. Bitcointalk speculation section isn't close to as doom and gloom as the 2015 lows. We didn't have a Mt. Gox like incident this year, but the charts are highly similar. I don't know which of those are bullish and which are bearish. Guess I'm a contrarian usually. This stock market has to come down at some point, the fundamentals don't add up. KMD can't stay at 60th forever; that is ridiculous undervaluation.

CNBC‚Äôs Brian Kelly: 'Bitcoin Will Resurrect'
The cryptocurrency bear market has caused major media to question whether digital assets are coming to an end. On June 22, CNBC‚Äôs Brian Kelly appeared on national television to remind viewers that Bitcoin isn‚Äôt dead yet. Bitcoin Below $6K, Still Up 156% From June 2017 On ...

[28-Jun-18 07:06 PM] Jazzy#0001
You highlight some good points. People who were around in 2014 have said again and again how fundamentally things have changed vs today. Back then they had no idea if something like Gox could have meant the end for bitcoin and the suicide hotline was pinned on reddit, but we've been through so much since then and now we know that nothing so far has managed to kill bitcoin and nothing on the horizon even has a chance.

[28-Jun-18 09:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
fortunately I had only 0.07 Btc left on Mt.Gox

[28-Jun-18 09:33 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Is this the start of a further fall?  Don‚Äôt remember seeing 23k range for a long time

[28-Jun-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
5990.99 BTC doesn't help

[28-Jun-18 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
