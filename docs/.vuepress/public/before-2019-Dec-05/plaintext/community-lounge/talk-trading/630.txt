[11-May-19 06:56 AM] Keppie#5156

[11-May-19 06:57 AM] Keppie#5156
Is this just fantasy?

[11-May-19 06:58 AM] Tek#5253

[11-May-19 07:02 AM] Keppie#5156

[11-May-19 07:12 AM] Tek#5253

[11-May-19 07:12 AM] LocoMB#8593

[11-May-19 07:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Markus ‘@Cryptoon Where do u find about max length of 40 bars? Might be interesting didnt know about that if thats the case‘ i think in an allessandro rastani vid on fib levels a couple months ago

[11-May-19 07:57 AM] Malti#3948
So crazy how I told myself in the bear all these strategies about not fomo’ing in the next bull

[11-May-19 07:57 AM] Malti#3948
But it’s hard when it comes to practice now

ZEC/BTC pair is a submarine looking for the bottom of the ocean

[11-May-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
just hold to its fiat price (barely)

[11-May-19 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
I recently learned Coinbase only has a ZEC/USD pair

[11-May-19 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
which is weird, but also explains why zec/btc is so different from zec/usd

[11-May-19 08:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Malti it is easy when you are broke 😛

[11-May-19 08:35 AM] Malti#3948
So you’re saying I should fomo in now until I’m broke to avoid fomo’ing later even more?

[11-May-19 08:36 AM] cascrypto#8206
Yes always fomo first

[11-May-19 08:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
hahah

[11-May-19 08:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is funny how all these youtube trading gurus, it could go up or it could go down, then when it goes in a direction, see i told you it will happen....

[11-May-19 08:40 AM] Malti#3948

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
kmd held up better than dash..

[11-May-19 09:10 AM] Tek#5253
dash made a new ATL

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
on the BTC/DASH chart

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
atleast KMD stayed above its most recent low

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
KMD made a higher low

[11-May-19 09:11 AM] Tek#5253
I think we have whalebro to thank for keeping up the price

[11-May-19 09:12 AM] Tek#5253
though the bitcoin pump was mostly big liquidations of shorts

[11-May-19 09:12 AM] Tek#5253
I think now that that is exhausted we'll have a few days of alt run

$6000 is a big level guys

[11-May-19 09:23 AM] klein#5233
going to take alot of work to get through it

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
@klein you mean 7000?

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
We said that about 6000 and 6500 as well

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] klein#5233
no $6k

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] klein#5233
it was a joke

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
Ah haha

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
Scuzi

[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
My point was the same

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] Malti#3948
Somebody said it here recently

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
every man and their dog was watching $6k

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] Malti#3948
If everybody thinks something is going to happen, the opposite will happen

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
as a big level

[11-May-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
market will fuck the most amount of people

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] Malti#3948
My only worry now is that everybody believes alt season is around the corner

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] Malti#3948
So if that logic applies. Alt season isn’t around the corner

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] klein#5233
some important highs got taken out that I have been watching

[11-May-19 09:28 AM] klein#5233
6550 and 6800

[11-May-19 09:29 AM] klein#5233
shorters would of had their stops above this level

A pull back now is more likely now that lots of people just got fucked I think

[11-May-19 09:39 AM] klein#5233
I'm praying just for a consolidation so KMD doesn't get dumped on
