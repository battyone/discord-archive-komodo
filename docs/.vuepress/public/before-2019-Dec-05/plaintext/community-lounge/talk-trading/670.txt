[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
yes but you forget that bitmex nigga runs the show

[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
first he pumps to 10k

[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
then he dumps back to 5k

[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
and then he fullfils his own prophecy and moons it to 50k

[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
it has to be absolutely unbelievable

[21-May-19 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
so first we pump to 10k

[21-May-19 09:36 PM] Tek#5253
retrace now would be too normal and organic

[21-May-19 09:36 PM] Tek#5253
we need to rekt margin traders fren!

[21-May-19 09:36 PM] Markus#5464
but at same time why pump it to 10k and let 69% longs take profits?

[21-May-19 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
the longs will be greedy and not sell at 10k

[21-May-19 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
then he dumps it to 5k and everyone gets rekt
