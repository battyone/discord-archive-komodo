YouTuber Alessio Rastani thinks Bitcoin may be correcting to a healthy $7500 before going higher; hopefully in an orderly fashion. I'm hoping the same, perhaps then Alts can have their turn.....and perhaps perfect timing for KMD.

[29-Jun-19 02:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
@yorklab Alessio's verbal patterns make me chuckle.  He will often tell the audience he is going to tell them something before telling them that thing.  Very amusing verbal pattern that is common among Persians.

[29-Jun-19 02:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
its like he is giving notice that he is about to say something... which is an odd thing to do with a captive audience that tuned in to hear what he has to say.
