but for a showcase, it makes sense for us to make a USDK

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can spin up a stablecoin for any of the 32 fiats backed by any BTC protocol coin

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] Markus#5464
Alright will u be able to create ur own bot based on the api to make automated swaps?

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] Tek#5253
so you are trying to make kmd a worthy hold right? nice work fren

[13-Sep-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus why not?

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a blockchain based system

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody could write any bot they want

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
probably we will make some reference bots

[13-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Markus#5464
Sounds good brought me some nice ideas

[13-Sep-19 01:55 PM] Markus#5464
This i like alot üëç

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on getting nSPV support for all the various CC, so you can do all this via superlite wallet

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
that is basically required for mass market usage

[13-Sep-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so having CC power accessible via superlite, this is the ultimate combination

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
any plans to make stable btc swap aswell?

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
will BTC end up with crazy fees again?

[13-Sep-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
that just makes it very hard to design any sort of service, when txfees can vary by 100x

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Markus#5464
well true

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i think best to let others deal with other coins

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
thats why people r building on bch instead

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
or eth

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
why not build on DOGE

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
doge isn't maintained code

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
thats why

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] Tek#5253
üòõ

[13-Sep-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if it has multisig, that is good enough

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so each coin community can issue their own stablecoin, backed in their coin for their favorite fiat

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
mona coin can make a JPY stable coin, backed by mona

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Tek#5253
i don't get why everyone wants to make fiat stable coins

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
basically it wont require some sort of large scale banking arrangement to make a stablecoin

[13-Sep-19 01:59 PM] Markus#5464
This is a game changer this will blow up without doubt

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason people want to do the normal stable coins is they get to keep the interest on the deposits

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] Markus#5464
Im only worried that it might kill traditional trades cause ppl might just trade swaps

[13-Sep-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
get a billion in deposits, issue a billion of stablecoins. then you can collect whatever interests on the billion that you can

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and people need fiat to pay real world bills, so it seems there will be demand for stablecoins for a while

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and again, atomicDEX is a critical part of the combined system of all these various stablecoins in the ecosystem

[13-Sep-19 02:01 PM] Tek#5253
hm ok

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] allbits#5898
I think BTCK would be useful for trading purposes

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
imaging swapping ur kmd on top of bull cycle and convert back at lowest point

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] Markus#5464
insane

[13-Sep-19 02:03 PM] allbits#5898
Since so many markets are quoted in btc

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] allbits#5898
Although I wish everyone would just move to BCH dominated markets

[13-Sep-19 02:04 PM] allbits#5898
Or KMD!

[13-Sep-19 02:11 PM] joe2x4#5987
A random thought. Can this be used to create unstable coins? Ie: K-DASH, Komodo coin backed by DASH. Might help boost demand for kmd

[13-Sep-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
you could back it with any btc protocol coin and it can be pegged to any price you can get a DTO pricefeed for

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] allbits#5898
That's interesting. It could be used to create "coins" that are otherwise not technically possible to be atomic swapped

[13-Sep-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
i designed the system so you can define any sort of combination of prices, including indexes, and peg it to that

[13-Sep-19 02:35 PM] Markus#5464
Komodo pegged to gold price üöÄ

[13-Sep-19 02:35 PM] Markus#5464
GOLDK

[13-Sep-19 02:37 PM] Tek#5253
DGX is a gram of gold

[13-Sep-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes pegging to gold price can be done, but it wont be physical gold, cash settled based on the price of gold

[13-Sep-19 02:55 PM] willofleo#7505
how does KMD interest play in the loan ?

[13-Sep-19 02:56 PM] willofleo#7505
say if I lend kmd , i am not getting the interest , so does that mean liquidators are better off hoping  for the event of  liquidating in order to get the 5%

[13-Sep-19 02:57 PM] willofleo#7505
and who get to be liquidator , also who get that 5% of collateral

[13-Sep-19 02:58 PM] willofleo#7505
@jl777c

[13-Sep-19 03:00 PM] willofleo#7505
as in is it the lender? or a centralised group of active chosen member who get to be liquidators  or is the 5% splits between both

[13-Sep-19 03:05 PM] meatspoon#7860
@jl777c @jorian  I was chatting with @richardt who was saying he lost KMD in a trade for BTC.  He can give you more details than I, since it happened to him, but I think he lost KMD that he was trading for BTC.  The KMD landed in the appropriate address but he didnt receive BTC.  This was a couple days ago he told me.  Dont know if his situation has been resolved or not.

[13-Sep-19 03:07 PM] jorian#4555
well then it's up to richardt to contact the devs and see what happened + how to get it back

[13-Sep-19 03:07 PM] LocoMB#8593
Gold is coming back in a big fucking way- not that it was ever gone anyway

[13-Sep-19 03:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
@jorian he did.  But because I know about it, i will comment on it.  people should know there is a chance that their coin will disappear.  And if you guys are chatting about demo'ing it to the public, y'all should be aware that it might fail

[13-Sep-19 03:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
a public demo gone wrong would really fuck up whatever image KMD has.

[13-Sep-19 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
true

[13-Sep-19 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
although it's in public beta already

[13-Sep-19 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
beta means something can go wrong

[13-Sep-19 03:11 PM] jorian#4555
nothing wrong with showing a beta

[13-Sep-19 03:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, and a public beta certainly will help devs find and squash bugs.  but pleeeeeease don't demo it to the public until it is flawless

[13-Sep-19 03:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
at least not a live demo

[13-Sep-19 03:12 PM] jorian#4555
don't think it will ever be flawless

[13-Sep-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
@willofleo KMD rewards go to the msig signers. as i wrote above, anybody can be a liquidator. just close out an account that has too little equity with the stablecoin. the blockchain itself will get some extra reserves on each liquidation. this mechanism is what keeps the peg intact

[13-Sep-19 03:45 PM] tolken#2655
@jl777c Apologies in advance as I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt the most interesting question, but how far off is this USDK/  Kmd loan system? I‚Äôve been wanting to use this forever (ethlend doesn‚Äôt want to add Kmd, nor do any of the other crypto loan companies) so I‚Äôm eager to use this.

[13-Sep-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
a working system is in testing, but it is going slowly as most of the effort is going into atomicDEX. hard to know when USDK will be ready, especially the GUI side of things. but we do need to get nSPV support for CC working first anyway, in order to get to something the mass market can use. i expect that will arrive this year, but dont ask me about GUI timelines.

[13-Sep-19 03:48 PM] tolken#2655
Got it, thanks, good to know. Do you think a static html based version might be sufficient for GUI dev (perhaps via rpc calls) ?

[13-Sep-19 03:50 PM] tolken#2655
The idea of very simple html based interfaces seems really cool, assuming it provides enough for easy to use GUI and no reliance on an external html server.

[13-Sep-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so far the nspv html wallet seems sufficient, you can see screenshots of it: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZvzrhNBQgroejTKPl0kCOTJ8h7XMnO2M?usp=sharing

[13-Sep-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it is more for debugging to make sure all the data is there, so it is a lot more cluttered than an end user GUI would be, but the concept of dynamically generating static html 100% within the nspv C code, it is demonstrated

[13-Sep-19 04:29 PM] Neko#5830
@jl777c why kmd addresses start with r??

[13-Sep-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the base58 prefix is 60, that makes it start with 'R'

@jl777c that‚Äôs brilliant.

[13-Sep-19 04:50 PM] ca333#0118
Thanks for the feedback. The DEX is working pretty well and we are not aware of any "lost" funds - neither the dev nor the support team. Our statistics show a near 100% swap success rate. @meatspoon we actually already had a few demos previously - and all these swaps were 100% successful. Speaking technically - no funds were "lost" during any trades - IF a swap failed and the coins did not make it through please contact our support team which can help you resolve your specific problem. In rare occasions coins can get stuck (but not lost) when you for example go offline (or other reasons for interruptions) during a cross-chain atomic swap and cause a timeout. But rest assured that the coins are not lost. We are already working on a automagic "recover_funds_of_swap" mechanims to automate this process and turn it "grandma friendly" so that GUI users won't have to do this manually or contact support for help. However, this is still an ongoing beta stage - so these sort of things are expected and just help us bring AtomicDEX to perfection.

just to be sure

[13-Sep-19 05:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can try it with test tokens to be sure.  I did a DGB to Dash Swap not too long ago  and many kmd to othercoin swaps .  Just use small amounts

[13-Sep-19 06:58 PM] dan.#2473
Highly unlikely funds get lost with mm2

[13-Sep-19 06:59 PM] dan.#2473
mm1 never lost funds

[13-Sep-19 06:59 PM] dan.#2473
funds get "stuck"? sure.

[13-Sep-19 06:59 PM] dan.#2473
but always got them back

[13-Sep-19 07:18 PM] tolken#2655
Team is great too. Had some eth funds stuck back in mm1 days, artem wrote some custome code to unlock it. Still wise to use smal amounts during beta, but the support is great in my experience.

Just fyi: swaps success rate is close to 97% in the AtomicDEX network. And thats is very complex network already! Different phone OSes and models, different internet provider on different continents. People swapping even on mountains.
And by my evaluation around 0.01% or so are swaps with "stuck" funds. And most of these cases will be prevented since new edge cases discovering and  easy resolvable with "unstuck" API added to GUI as CA said.
And btw in this particular richardt's case raised above: it was reviewed quite fast after he contacted us. And he was informed that funds just temporary stuck but not "lost".
