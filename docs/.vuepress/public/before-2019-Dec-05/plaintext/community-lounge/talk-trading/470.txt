Top shelf Komodos I wonder if they are golden and my $0.56 kmd are just plain red.

I always sell my KMD at big gaines. Works 99% of the time. 30-40% gain in  a day is bound to go down.

[13-Mar-19 11:56 AM] ch6ris#5240
If I do that it usually moons

[13-Mar-19 11:57 AM] ch6ris#5240
Sold most of my ico coins for pennies.

[13-Mar-19 11:57 AM] ch6ris#5240
Didn't appreciate the project at that time.

@Tekmaybe so you can't have it all

[13-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
apparently there is a difference between huobi and huobi global

[13-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd is listed on global

[13-Mar-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
I have equal percentage amounts of KMD and RLC in my folio

[13-Mar-19 12:38 PM] Tek#5253
the battle can now begin

[13-Mar-19 12:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
wtf was that volume buy to 37k sats?

proof of protection should be switched out for dPoW imo

[13-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Draeth#3300
Key me know what you think @jorian @NNoperator

[13-Mar-19 01:02 PM] jorian#4555
proof of protection is back! 😄

[13-Mar-19 01:02 PM] jorian#4555
i mean 😦

[13-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Draeth#3300
Lol didn't notice that,  they must have forgotten to change the text

[13-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Draeth#3300
Aside from that,  what do you think

[13-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what are the 4 pillars?

[13-Mar-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
from marketing maybe use the 4 pillars for the words

[13-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Draeth#3300
Security,  scalability,  interoperability and adaptability?

[13-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Draeth#3300
@jl777c so use the 4 pillars instead of i"n Dpow we trust - est 2016"?

[13-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of "safe" .. "secure"

[13-Mar-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but those are long words...\

[13-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Draeth#3300
Ahh

[13-Mar-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe shorter variants of the 4 pillars

[13-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Draeth#3300
I could remove the 7s on that side to make room

[13-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Draeth#3300
And hide them somewhere else

[13-Mar-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe just "adaptable" and "secure"

[13-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Draeth#3300
That'll work

[13-Mar-19 01:12 PM] gcharang#6833
maybe remove ` "safe" .. "secure" .. 777 in the front` and replace with `secure scales adaptable`

[13-Mar-19 01:13 PM] Draeth#3300
I could fit security,  scalability and adaptability

[13-Mar-19 01:13 PM] gcharang#6833
sure if it will fit 👍

[13-Mar-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
binance volumes still around 10,000 KMD

[13-Mar-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
per minute

[13-Mar-19 01:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in my experience, these spikes tend to mean that more up will come

[13-Mar-19 01:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is just how breakouts happen

[13-Mar-19 01:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weekly looks like open above 41ema a couple weeks ago, then retest and when now 8ema seems to be crossing over, a breakout happened (FOMO buy)

[13-Mar-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
binance sellside upto 40k sats is now much less

[13-Mar-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the big volume was huobi arbitrage

[13-Mar-19 01:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also, higher volume is a dead giveaway that something is brewing

[13-Mar-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
there was 1 million KMD withdrawn from binance

[13-Mar-19 01:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
hopefully for elections 😂

[13-Mar-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it was when huobi bids were above 100k

[13-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Draeth#3300

Is this what you were thinking @jl777c @gcharang

[13-Mar-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
all scrunchy now...

[13-Mar-19 01:43 PM] Draeth#3300
I know,  it'll be adjusted

[13-Mar-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe "secure" "scalable" and "adaptable" instead

[13-Mar-19 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
adaptability looks broken

[13-Mar-19 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ah, ok

[13-Mar-19 01:44 PM] Draeth#3300
Kk

[13-Mar-19 01:44 PM] BanHammer#8115
too much "ity"

[13-Mar-19 01:44 PM] Draeth#3300
Also. Any comments on side 2?

[13-Mar-19 01:45 PM] BanHammer#8115
really like the design though

[13-Mar-19 01:45 PM] Draeth#3300
@BanHammer awesome,  that's what I was hoping for

[13-Mar-19 01:46 PM] 74D30#6106
Safe secure multiverse

[13-Mar-19 01:47 PM] 74D30#6106
Thats what it should say. Make people curious silver changes hands as well.

[13-Mar-19 01:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
weekly looks like trendline break, retest and pump afterwards.

@74D30 multiverse wouldn't really fit since it's not one of the pillars

[13-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Draeth#3300
Technically

[13-Mar-19 01:50 PM] 74D30#6106
Gotcha

[13-Mar-19 02:01 PM] jorian#4555
can't we just put a big MOON on one side of the coin? 😛

[13-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Draeth#3300
again, the text will be adjusted, but does the wording look better now? https://imgur.com/iYR4TFE

btc network is getting a little overwhelmed atm. did the power come back on in venezuela? https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions

[13-Mar-19 02:22 PM] 74D30#6106

why didn't I set unrealistic sell orders at + 100%

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] jorian#4555
have you done it now?

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
pumps represent a small percentage of time, so statistically what else to expect

[13-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Tek#5253
no all my kmd is on a wallet.
