[04-May-19 01:51 PM] Markus#5464

[04-May-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops them from moving the BTC price to trigger all the stops as they have all the info needed, and the capital to do it

[04-May-19 01:53 PM] Markus#5464
ofc they have the funds for it

[04-May-19 01:53 PM] Markus#5464
around 20.000 btc got liquidated when price went from 4k to 5k

[04-May-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not to mention when btc went from 6k to 3k

[04-May-19 01:54 PM] Vertigo#0439
Two years ago I asked hollow man what is a good price to get in Komodo he said anything under 30k is good 😂

[04-May-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
he was right

[04-May-19 01:55 PM] Vertigo#0439
I think that was the price at the time

[04-May-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
below 20k is really good

[04-May-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
below 10k is really really good

[04-May-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
just add more "really" the lower it goes

[04-May-19 01:56 PM] Markus#5464
i believe below 20k is extremely good

[04-May-19 01:56 PM] Vertigo#0439
I been doing that got a big chunk at $0.63

[04-May-19 01:57 PM] Vertigo#0439

I think the worst was that bittrex CEO choose to be a advisor, must of been paid a big bag for that to happen

[04-May-19 04:09 PM] Markus#5464
Hopefully that bag was BTC not VBK :troll_lol:

[04-May-19 05:32 PM] LocoMB#8593
VBK shysters seem to be using the allegation that in theory it is possible to get pseudo readable java source code from bytecode, do I understand that correctly?
(disregarding all real life circumstance that such decompiled code is virtually meaningless)
.. and preying on their gullible noob lunchmoney donors to eagerly snatch that excuse and run off with it to wave it around everywhere

[04-May-19 05:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah

[04-May-19 05:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

watching this level closely

[05-May-19 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
@Kitchen Table apologies for not releasing the Windows installer version. you can use the portable version to vote as well. there is no difference in terms of features in portable version. it will work the same and even easier to start with. just download, extract and double-click Agama.exe file to start stage 0.3.5

[05-May-19 12:43 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
@SHossain The main reason why I asked about the windows installer is because that is what my KMD node as been running on for nearly two years without any problems. I will download the portal version is use it to vote then and if the node can use it over the installer, I'll just leave it running.

[05-May-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
i understand you have been using the installer. there is 0 difference between the installer and portable as how you run KMD node. both will do same job.
imagine the installer version is raw food which you need to prepare by cooking (installing) before you can eat
and imagine the portable as pre-cooked, you just need to unwrap and eat (use)
