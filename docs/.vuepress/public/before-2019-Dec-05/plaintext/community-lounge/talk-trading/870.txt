kmd fast in dumping, slow during rise, no schill army, only tech educated whales.... be patience my fried!

[27-Jun-19 05:31 PM] richardt#2807
If BTC chills out for the next 2-3 weeks, KMD could have a chance to have a big rise with the releases

[27-Jun-19 05:32 PM] blubbi#0643
kmd price : 1/tech

[27-Jun-19 05:33 PM] richardt#2807
tech alone is evidently not enough.  Need to have a large developer/user base

[27-Jun-19 05:34 PM] richardt#2807
Hoping Antara and AtomicDEX will change that

$BTC corrected faster than expected and now it looks like the time to get into alts, the chart looks ripe, time for the money to flow down from BTC. #Altcoins #altseason

[27-Jun-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
if ur talking about the 39k candle then it was huobi pumping it to 120k sats on huobi which triggered arb bots

[27-Jun-19 05:48 PM] blubbi#0643
jep, houbi's small orderbocks get cleared, rest done by bots

to many gaps are filled

[27-Jun-19 06:04 PM] yorklab#7270
I would think the Notary Node operators aren't too happy right now. It takes time and money to keep things up and running 24/7.

[27-Jun-19 06:05 PM] yorklab#7270
On the other hand the USD price was much lower at one point and the NN operator's we're still going strong.

[27-Jun-19 06:07 PM] Sherdogz#6731
So 100k is far away now i was already daydreaming 😄

KMD crazy cheap right now too 🙄 too bad most of this discord bought their bags and are holding through these sad declines.  The advice “buy more” only works for so long when every “support” has been fallen through

[27-Jun-19 06:18 PM] grumpygoron#4320
And we’ve nearly fallen to #70.

[27-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Alexfrog#1338
that basically

[27-Jun-19 06:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The advice “buy more” only works for so long when every “support” has been fallen through`
"buy more" doesn't mean "use every available fund you have and buy all you can now"

[27-Jun-19 06:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
we need a bill and ted '69 dude meme

[27-Jun-19 06:23 PM] BlockTech#6895
Maybe it's a marketing strategy. Not making to much noise about antara. Pushing price down, so a few days before antara launch, pump price regularly, so market goes green for a few days, attracting peoples eyes. People take info on komodo, see new tech will be released, push Fomo, attract more eyes Boom KMD to 100$ 😎

[27-Jun-19 06:23 PM] dan.#2473
Meh

[27-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Alexfrog#1338
""buy more" doesn't mean "use every available fund you have and buy all you can now"

We kid around ¹/tech but ask yourselves why trading is the most popular channel in every discord

[27-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
averaging down is a good idea

[27-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i bought other shitcoins at the top and lost money on them 😛

[27-Jun-19 06:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
i bought multiple btc worth at $10

[27-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Alexfrog#1338
converted them to KMD and lost money on it also

[27-Jun-19 06:25 PM] Alexfrog#1338
(though the other coins would also have lost money)

[27-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Oriol02#9169
everyone here will win money on KMD. As soon as the ecosistem grows and get good projects.

[27-Jun-19 06:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you're out of funds and you didn't have a specific plan when you spent the last bit of funds, then `learn to trade within your means or learn to trade better`

[27-Jun-19 06:28 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Average down is usually not a good strategy

[27-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Average down worked for me with arrr

Will be interesting to see how KMD is going to 69 its way out of this downtrend

[27-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The speculative markets have abandoned it

Let’s see what Antara does

[27-Jun-19 06:47 PM] richardt#2807
Oh I'm sure there will plenty of speculation when it gets closer to July 15th.  The question is whether the releases will be good enough to maintain the price

[27-Jun-19 06:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
no matter what, something is going to happen 😃

[27-Jun-19 07:53 PM] crumb#2550
i wouldn't expect official Antara release to be a major trigger for massive price increase. it's just a name for tech, thats has been developed and not something totally new falling out of the sky
