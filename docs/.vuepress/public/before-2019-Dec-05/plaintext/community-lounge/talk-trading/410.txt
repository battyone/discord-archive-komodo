The boots got a makeover after this photo but it came out allright.

[12-Feb-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
why is the KMD volume always so low?

[12-Feb-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
why does KMD price only go down?

[12-Feb-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
why do all the other coins go up and KMD goes down?

[12-Feb-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
where are all the peoples who usually ask the above questions?

[12-Feb-19 07:11 PM] Buddz1993#5380
they are waiting for it to happen again , so they can come out from the shadows

[12-Feb-19 07:12 PM] Buddz1993#5380
hopefully they will be gone for a while

[12-Feb-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
even with the $5 mil volume we are still right around the middle of the top 50, more corresponding to current rank. still it is 5% marketcap. So on average, it might be below 1% per day, but we do get these 10x boosts in volumes when everyones indicators go green

[12-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
@FishyGuts hah agreed. I buy some KMD every few weeks and will continue to do so until it goes above ~30k sats

[12-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
then I'll just stake for a year or two

[12-Feb-19 07:28 PM] Tek#5253
then I'll dump half my stack.

[12-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Tek#5253
the staking is pretty interesting I neever had the chance to have a decent stake in a staking coin so

[12-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Tek#5253
5% is awesome, no bank account gives you this

[12-Feb-19 07:42 PM] Lieutenant#1428
2 months I've been waiting for this moment.  two months ago I sold 20k stratis and bought 40k kmd. Today I bought back 40k stratis.  thank you kmd.

[12-Feb-19 07:44 PM] Lieutenant#1428
I will wait for the moment to sell 40k strat and buy back 80k kmd

[12-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Markus#5464

[12-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Markus#5464
but then we know it was whale action, so if market is not rdy for this move then it will dump back down

[12-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Markus#5464
i quess we will see next days :p

[12-Feb-19 08:17 PM] Wazzup#0510
@jl777c  It;s all about perspective and market cycles. And current position on CMC doesn;t even matter that much. What matters tho is longevity. Money grabs will slowly die out and with time people will look towards legitimate projects that stood the test of time.

[12-Feb-19 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, I know this. when months seems like a long time for some people, for me years is a short time. it will take at least a decade if not decades for blockchain usage to become the multimillions. then the market leaders will be worth many multiples of entire crypto marketcap, even if they have no tokenomics today

@Tek you can deposit btc, eth, ltc and a bunch of other coins on Celsius and get weekly interest that equates to between 3% and 7%. Rates change most weeks depending on demand. Interest is currently paid in like-kind, so BTC earns BTC and ETH earns ETH.

[12-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
@meatspoon does it take dash? I don't feel confy giving my coins to some bank tho

[12-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Tek#5253
what if they exit scam me

[12-Feb-19 08:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
They don‚Äôt do dash.

[12-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
then i cant use it cause I'm mainly Dash and KMD üòÑ

[12-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Alexfrog#1338
3-7% weekly interest seems like a ponzi scheme to me.  Like this is the new cryptodouble.com üòõ

[12-Feb-19 08:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
Annually

[12-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Tek#5253
yeah that sounds too much also

[12-Feb-19 08:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
I keep trying to edit my comment to add ‚Äúannually‚Äù but it won‚Äôt take

[12-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
all of my bag s are mooning rn

[12-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Tek#5253
fuck yea

[12-Feb-19 08:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
If you look at Celsius, Alex Mashinsky is the CEO. Creator of voip. Custody is done by BitGo.  Exit scam is unlikely

[12-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
surely will consider putting some crypto in a bank depending on decent returns some time in the future but right now

[12-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
nah

[12-Feb-19 08:59 PM] Tek#5253
thanks though

[12-Feb-19 09:58 PM] Alexfrog#1338
oh so its 3-7% annually?  not a scam then, but still a risk of letting others control your coins.  might be worth it

[13-Feb-19 12:21 AM] Likewise#6767
still here, volume shows another market manipulated dump. Volume went from 38 BTC to 653 BTC in 48 hours. A nice orchestrated pump, watch the sell off.

[13-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
sometimes whales buy, and its not an 'orchestrated pump' lol

[13-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Likewise#6767
or...unless we finally start a sustained bull run

[13-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah

[13-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Likewise#6767
euh if they buy and 2 days later price is back where it started it is a pumnp kid

[13-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Likewise#6767
time will tell, but throughout whole 2018 all we have seen were pump/dumps

[13-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i thought the Komodo chart was screaming that a huge move up was imminent for like 2 weeks+, and i was shocked that it wasnt happening and the price was in the 17ks

[13-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Then it finally happened

[13-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Likewise#6767
me too, was bound to happen but my point is, a sustained bull lasts weeks, months with small corrections. What we see here (all of crypto) mostly our price manipulation.

[13-Feb-19 12:26 AM] NNoperator#3835
whale has sucked up all the sells on binance!

[13-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Markus#5464
its mooning

[13-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Likewise#6767
nice one

[13-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Likewise#6767
I like that I can now claim rewards while keeping them on my ledger, that for me is a step forwrd

[13-Feb-19 12:27 AM] NNoperator#3835
mesmerizing to witness the rapid fire buying

[13-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Likewise#6767
8 or 10$ is all I need and I'm retired üòÉ

[13-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
komodo deserves to be 100k sats minimum

[13-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the top 20 is full of shitcoins

[13-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
komodo should be there

[13-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its better than chain bloating eth

[13-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and way better than shit like Tron and Eos

[13-Feb-19 12:29 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and ripple, whose token is pointless and exists only to allow the company to dump on people forever

[13-Feb-19 12:30 AM] bishop#9773
@Likewise If 8-10/per is all you need to retire, you must be sitting on half a million coins or more, or living in a place with cheap standard of living.

[13-Feb-19 12:30 AM] Alexfrog#1338
only takes like a mill to retire, if youre willing to live moderately

[13-Feb-19 12:31 AM] bishop#9773
we'll see those numbers change when the annualized 5- and 10-yr numbers of markets are low single digits and likely negative after inflation

[13-Feb-19 12:31 AM] Likewise#6767
Thats right, I semi retired in 2006, jsut trade the SPX500 and sonme others since then, doing great. if KMD goes to 10$, Im out üòÉ

[13-Feb-19 12:31 AM] NNoperator#3835
@Likewise  did you retire in December 2017? Or are you newer to KMD?

[13-Feb-19 12:34 AM] Likewise#6767
In december 2017 I didnt have KMD, only sold my BTC back then. Started getting into  KMD in th e bear market, sold it with a minor loss, waited and started buying back at 0.00014 15 16 17 18 sats, loaded up heavily

[13-Feb-19 12:35 AM] bishop#9773
Guy is a wizard. Sells peaks, buys lows

[13-Feb-19 12:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wish i sold the high lol

[13-Feb-19 12:35 AM] Likewise#6767
where did I sell peaks jsu said I didnt have any KMD jsut had btc which I indeed sold at 15K$ Why?

[13-Feb-19 12:35 AM] bishop#9773
that's what I mean... sold BTC at close to ATHs

[13-Feb-19 12:36 AM] NNoperator#3835
Looks like good timing,  we will be back to 50k+ soon enough

[13-Feb-19 12:36 AM] bishop#9773
and now buying KMD at basically ATLs

[13-Feb-19 12:36 AM] bishop#9773
wizard.

[13-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Likewise#6767
as so many others did who can read market sentiment, think you guys should know some of us have been trading way before crypto cameabout

[13-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Likewise#6767
jealous kid?

[13-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Likewise#6767
I got proof. DO you?

[13-Feb-19 12:37 AM] bishop#9773
no, just find it incredible that you didn't buy at 30k sat

[13-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Likewise#6767
why buy at 30 sats

[13-Feb-19 12:37 AM] bishop#9773
Did I knock you at all, I don't think I did.

[13-Feb-19 12:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
Likewise is all prickly. Why is everyone a kid?

[13-Feb-19 12:38 AM] bishop#9773
just if true, you basically top and bottom ticked the market in crypto (most likely)

[13-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Likewise#6767
As I said I got in in the bear market at around 0.0005, saw it dropping, didnt buy the dip but cut my loss, and waited it out and re entered later in the year

[13-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Likewise#6767
it is called trading üòâ

[13-Feb-19 12:40 AM] Likewise#6767
BTC got in April around 1800$ sold December at 15k$. Then started looking at KMD but as I said bought some, bear market went on, cut my loss and got back in a few months ago. Nothing out of the ordinary really.

[13-Feb-19 12:40 AM] Likewise#6767
I like to call you kids because most here could probably be smy son, kids üòÉ

[13-Feb-19 12:41 AM] meatspoon#7860
Like we are young enough to be your kids or like you boned most of our mothers?

{Reactions}
üòÇ 

[13-Feb-19 12:41 AM] Likewise#6767
probably both lol üòâ I'm 47 guys, living in Asia, used to be an offshore oildiver till I got into trading early 2000's, have been trading since.

[13-Feb-19 12:43 AM] meatspoon#7860
Pretty bad ass that you boned my mom while you were in kindergarten. Props, dad.

[13-Feb-19 12:43 AM] Likewise#6767
hahaha I was a young starter, a self starter

[13-Feb-19 12:44 AM] meatspoon#7860
Self starter sounds like a metaphor for masturbation.

[13-Feb-19 12:45 AM] Likewise#6767
yeah, when mom isnt around the old hand comes out. No need for that in asia though

[13-Feb-19 12:45 AM] Likewise#6767
10$ and I will fly you and mom out here

[13-Feb-19 12:50 AM] Likewise#6767
0.000186 is where I entered jsut had a look. Can't attach the screenshot

[13-Feb-19 01:04 AM] Markus#5464
that was a quick up and down xD

[13-Feb-19 01:04 AM] Alecandro#1179
180K KMD in that 15m candle pump....

[13-Feb-19 01:07 AM] richardt#2807
