It’s just btcm which is empty account

[05-Oct-18 06:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if empty and you are done with it, them stop using that exchange

[05-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sounds like a problem on the btcm side of things

[05-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Otherwise all other accounts would be compromised as well?

[05-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah sounds like it to me tbh, they’re like Australia’s number one Btc/fiat exchange

[05-Oct-18 07:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tried opening company account with local exchange. they asked company account detail. didn't proceed with them.

hashrate for PIRATE tripled in the last few days

Bithumb planning a dex with rtn or something like that LOL

[05-Oct-18 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems all major exchanges are opening Dex alternatives

[05-Oct-18 02:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
They wont actually be DEX's though, right?  How can a centralized entity create a DEX without legal repercussions if/when regulators tell them to toe the line

[05-Oct-18 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
details

[05-Oct-18 02:39 PM] dan.#2473
probably dexes only in the sense of not being custodians of funds. i am envisioning dexes where the middle man (the exchanges) help sort the order matching by being a man-in-the-middle transaction rather than relaying connections, and you will still need an exchange account and kyc. Everythings still trackable for them, and honestly probably less liability as they dont have to worry about long term custodianship of customer funds

[05-Oct-18 02:40 PM] dan.#2473
i dont think major exchanges want to do dexs for fun, theres prob a reason, such as less liability

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
but they have to worry about regulators applying pressure on them and changing them over time, essentially co-opting them

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am highly suspicious of DEX's run by centralized entities

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dan.#2473
yeah, they shouldnt be called DEXs

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dan.#2473
its prob going to be a CEX where you have your priv keys

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
All it takes is a government or governments applying pressure on the corporation to "comply" whatever that means

[05-Oct-18 02:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah

[05-Oct-18 02:43 PM] dan.#2473
i am sure there will be variations of this, but i would bet this is the direction it goes

[05-Oct-18 04:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
zcash is worth less than DOGE

KMD whale did the monthly withdraw from binance, he is accumulating 10,000+ KMD per day

[06-Oct-18 06:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
whale should learn to use the z address :trollface:

[06-Oct-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no 5% then

[06-Oct-18 07:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
having that much in a single address, that whale is very confident in his OPSEC.

[06-Oct-18 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh had forgot about that

Hypothetically if someone was like

Top 100 or so address

[06-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
There’s no way people could specifically target them right? It’s more the more you hold the bigger loss occurs if shit hits the fan

[06-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
But security wise having little and having a lot is no difference, bar the people who find out about someone’s said stack and targets them from the knowledge of their holdings

[06-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Having it in a z address would make no difference in security of funds

[06-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just that others won’t be able to find out who owns it correct?

[06-Oct-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... if they are sitting in Z address then nobody knows where they are...

[06-Oct-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But you can just send to Z and back to a new T ... but with 6 million coins thats obvious you did so.

[06-Oct-18 09:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Deleted User  if you got 10^6 KMD in a single address - imagine you make a transaction with a guy that is evil (but you dont know it). After you make such transaction (might be small - you buy a cop of coffee) - he can see you own quite a lot. He can then threat your life untill you give him your KMD. Imagine now a mafia or a gang by chance knows that info about you... Youy are easy target unless you have strong personal guards with weapons.
