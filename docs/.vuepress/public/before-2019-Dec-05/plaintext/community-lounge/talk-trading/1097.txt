@dukeleto  they k64 are game devs they are all marketing look and feel. They play hard and live hard we can't be all core devs with autisme and a hard on for deper technical code. Let them enjoy their succes and if you want to worry worry about what they will do with those other 60 million k64. They have a good team and i enjoyed their company with expensive gin tonic üçª

[29-Aug-19 02:59 PM] BanHammer#8115
@dukeleto you could also wonder why Redfox would let them fly all the way there for

[29-Aug-19 03:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@cascrypto you are an expert troll or one of the most degen people in here üòâ

[29-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Markus#5464
Maybe they didnt fly to vietnam to meet redfox?

[29-Aug-19 03:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
"core dev with autism and a hard-on for deeper technical code", I need to remember that for my next job interview

[29-Aug-19 03:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Markus it was actually a green screen, lulz

[29-Aug-19 03:04 PM] Markus#5464
really? :troll_lol:

[29-Aug-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
It remains to be seen if KMD wants to keep notarizing the K64 chain. Perhaps they will refund the money, if RFOX is going take legal action against K64

[29-Aug-19 03:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
K64 without dpow, well, that's nothing at all

[29-Aug-19 03:05 PM] BanHammer#8115
They would just fly there without an appointment?

[29-Aug-19 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cease notarizing a coin that has paid is not very cool for the coin that paid a service. I m not in K64 and have no bags... but please, don't make that mistake. Keep KMD away from those political stuff.

It could sound like KMD has the superpower to stop protecting his customers, please don't do that :(, you have your own supporters and users that may are both in KMD and K64, please.

precaution to say from an official dev : we may stop notas is not very "precautionnous"

[29-Aug-19 03:19 PM] BanHammer#8115
Yes and I don't agree with their tone

[29-Aug-19 03:20 PM] cascrypto#8206
@Deleted User  yes love the project bags are full ;0) but I agree with DWY and Jman this k64 is not being handled in a profesional way and that is not only their mistake

[29-Aug-19 03:20 PM] cascrypto#8206
they started a shit storm if you would ask me

rfox ending relationship with k64 does not mean kmd is doing it too.  Kmd is neutral. They're just part of the same kmd ecosystem and that's it.

kmd is still small so these things can affect the main coin

but KMD is better than ETH though

Eth is in its death throes.   Founder abandoned the project,   5 years and no PoS,  demonstrably can‚Äôt scale,   All hopes pinned on sharding which as often been described here as unscrambling an omelet .

Kmd will be protean currency.   If/when PegCC and it‚Äôs related components are ready and integrated in.  People can choose to store value as nearly anything they choose,   Like the way payment processor stocks perform ,  convert KMD to KMDVISA  and back again when needed.

This is revolutionary for a whole host of reasons .

[29-Aug-19 04:49 PM] richardt#2807
it's only revolutionary if/when it works and people actually use it

[29-Aug-19 04:51 PM] richardt#2807
we tend to use the term "revolutionary" too loosely in crypto üòÑ

[29-Aug-19 04:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Well to be able to directly invest in an  asset  that you would otherwise not be able to is pretty revolutionary.

3rd parties are a big source of problems in crypto

[29-Aug-19 04:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And in the real world.

[29-Aug-19 04:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
For instance an Iranian can‚Äôt invest in US stocks, the gatekeepers ( brokerages and regulatory orgs ) block them out.

[29-Aug-19 04:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Same , US investors have limited selection of Chinese companies they can invest in

[29-Aug-19 04:57 PM] richardt#2807
yeah, well, a lot of things were suppose to be revolutionary back then but never panned out.  So excuse me for not being overly excited just yet

We want to introduce our proof-of-concept Private Atomic Swaps. The first #privacyswap happened between $NIX and $KMD using #AtomicDEX. 

We want to thank the @KomodoPlatform team for their support. 

Exciting times ahead!  @FlareWallet üî•

@Deleted User seems that you missed me?

[29-Aug-19 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
Yes, I am a KMD core dev, and also, I am not a KMD employee and yes, I offered to buy his notary node so he would leave, as sanctioned by James. Notaries can buy notary nodes from other NNs. So again, there is no drama

[29-Aug-19 05:48 PM] tolken#2655
$NIX ?

[29-Aug-19 05:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
and also, there goes that new ZEC/BTC ATL, it just took some time

[29-Aug-19 05:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User it seems that you want the censorship of my opinions in here that made you leave the KMD notary network, funny

[29-Aug-19 05:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
censorship is a funny thing, depends on where it's aimed
