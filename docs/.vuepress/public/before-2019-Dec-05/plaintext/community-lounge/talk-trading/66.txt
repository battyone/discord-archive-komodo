[24-Jul-18 02:48 PM] Bittersweet#9376

[24-Jul-18 02:52 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171

Coindesk just had 5 minutes on CNN Quest means business. BTC lightning and ZCash. Not much more.

What if I told you it was a Raccoon @[TPUX] Djith Wattignies  - I mean I'm with you, rough video, but does it being a raccoon make you feel different üòõ

[24-Jul-18 05:19 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Oh guys,   Just wanted to let you know.... BTC is up like 5% so expect a 2.5-7% drop in KMD.

[24-Jul-18 05:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And we really should try and remove that image of Komodo rebranding from Karmacoin.   
I mean, cmon,  Karmacoin guys?    

Toneally Vaygue and ignorant statement.   What a douche.

Is that a triple bottom I see on the longer term daily or am I blind by the lack of sun in the bottom

Maybe it was because of my affinity for cigars, I like to think because of my cunning

[25-Jul-18 02:54 AM] FundazuSafu#1169

[25-Jul-18 02:55 AM] FundazuSafu#1169
11% sounds like she is stretching her wings at least

[25-Jul-18 02:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That might have been the bottom

[25-Jul-18 02:55 AM] FundazuSafu#1169

[25-Jul-18 02:59 AM] FundazuSafu#1169

[25-Jul-18 03:03 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[25-Jul-18 07:29 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Not selling before kmd = $1500

‚òª

[25-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets get kmd steadily above 10$ again first ;p

[25-Jul-18 08:01 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Yes plz

[25-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Bittersweet#9376
10$ would make my meager leftover holding interesting again

[25-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
let's go

[25-Jul-18 10:00 AM] pinkolin#9557
50$ is my dream

[25-Jul-18 10:01 AM] pinkolin#9557
Everything over this is ... impossible

[25-Jul-18 10:02 AM] pinkolin#9557
But for 50$ we need more noise.

[25-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Buddz1993#5380
nothing is impossible man

[25-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Buddz1993#5380
if we happen to reach 50 $ hows 100$ impossible remember  üòâ

[25-Jul-18 10:17 AM] Buddz1993#5380

$100 would put us at 10b marketcap

[25-Jul-18 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
tbh going by marketcap alone

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
quite a few coins hit those levels haha

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
verge tron neo eos

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
and a few others i dont remember but yeah, if you expect the overall marketcap to hit our old highs

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
and for us to hit top 10 or so coins

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
it's definately within "possible"

[25-Jul-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
likely? who knows, possible? definately

[25-Jul-18 10:48 AM] snowdamn#2414
guaranteed üòÄ

[25-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ye if it happened today we would be sitting ahead of EOS  ranked n5 bu ofc the market will mature and so will the capitalization of most of the coins which means for us to hit 100$ probabily btc would already be valued at 50k or more..

[25-Jul-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
right now EOS is trading at less than 2x book value, KMD is trading at 10x

[25-Jul-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I expect any coin that had $4 billion in capital would trade in the billions marketcap, but that doesnt mean as much as most people here seem to make it

[25-Jul-18 10:58 AM] snowdamn#2414
$4B LOL

[25-Jul-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a bit overcapitalized

[25-Jul-18 10:59 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Marketcap doesnt mean anything..

[25-Jul-18 10:59 AM] snowdamn#2414
no kidding

[25-Jul-18 10:59 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Sell me 1 kmd for 100$ .. lets see marketcap then..

üòÇ

[25-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Buddz1993#5380
ye its ridiculous tbh

[25-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
EOS is for sure of the most overvalued projects right now..

[25-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
and guess whos the most undervalued? üòÑ

[25-Jul-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
actually 1.7x cash is not very overvalued

[25-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
even with his current market cap?

[25-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Buddz1993#5380
its*

[25-Jul-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if the EOS marketcap goes below $4 bil, that means people think EOS will not even get $1 back for each $1

[25-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I see yes

[25-Jul-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how much whatever EOS raised is worth today. whatever that is, is the base. and the price is saying approx $2 of value per $1 of capital onhand.

[25-Jul-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
of course this assumes EOS will be a good centralized custodian of all those funds

[25-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Buddz1993#5380
well arent them the ones that dumped milions of eth raised on the ICO?

[25-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if the EOS holdings are audited. the way the prolonged ICO was held it wasnt impossible for EOS to use ICO funds to purchase more ICO shares

[25-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
not saying they did and it could well be there is a giant $4 bil EOS address

[25-Jul-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if someone can find the funds, that would put that question to rest

[25-Jul-18 11:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
i think i would retire at $1B

[25-Jul-18 11:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I dont see untill which certain point they would want their holding to be audited but ye I see what you mean

[25-Jul-18 11:10 AM] Buddz1993#5380
holdings*

[25-Jul-18 11:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
Does anybody know a KMD address cold or hot wallet of a exchange like Trex Upbit etc?

[25-Jul-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
likely #3 to #6 in richlist

[25-Jul-18 11:53 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sure about that?

[25-Jul-18 11:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
1.3 million USD worth of KMD is born every day at a 10B KMD market cap

[25-Jul-18 11:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs an immense downward pressure
