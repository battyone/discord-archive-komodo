So what if people expecting a drop already sold, so who will be selling to make a drop happen?

you could almost make a bot that buys and sells at bollinger borders

@Erratic_X1 How would I go about eating my dick? I would delegate the task like I delegate all unpleasant tasks. Most likely I would hire a Bangkok prostitute to do it for me. Slowly. Taking years if necessary. But this is conjecture. It's mathematically impossible for me ...

I bought BTC yesterday.

[23-Nov-18 10:03 PM] Vertigo#0439
Took 25 minutes for first confirmation.

[23-Nov-18 10:19 PM] ryman112#0068
Question.....So since BTC is incredibly slow at transactions and the volume is super high on sells does that mean we are seeing everything in a delay like really bad lag?  Such as if somebody bought a shit ton during this dip and it hasnt been confirmed due to the lag if you will?

[23-Nov-18 10:22 PM] ryman112#0068
I guess what Im asking is if its so slow and buys are waiting so long for confirmation when the price actually goes up due to those buys we see it hours after they were executed correct?

[23-Nov-18 10:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@ryman112  no, trading on exchanges are off chain transactions, and off chain transactions are way faster than on chain

[23-Nov-18 10:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
for example binance engine can execute 1.4M TPS

[23-Nov-18 10:36 PM] ryman112#0068
Cool thanks didn't know that

[23-Nov-18 10:44 PM] PHBA2061#2530
but if trading are done in a decentralized  manner, peer-to-peer, then your assumption may become true

came accross that yesterday... guy makes solid points ... they want a solid referance implementation that never changes... unlike BTC core which removes and adds RPC calls constantly how ever they like breaking every existing application built  on it.

[24-Nov-18 04:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and they also make very valid points that the block need to be about 600MB worth of transactions, so mining stays at eh same profit levels at the next halving

[24-Nov-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise miners stop mining the chain due to less profits

[24-Nov-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so 2 years to get enough transactions to fill 600MB blocks ... and we can bearly fill a 128mb block with current transactions, even trying to spam the crap out of it...

[24-Nov-18 05:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so mining stays at eh same profit levels at the next halving

That's really only a valid point for the length of time it takes to reach 2 diff cycles past any sizable exodus

[24-Nov-18 05:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

the three months of no volatility definitely seemed like a large scale manipulation. bitcoin just doesnt sit still for so long

[24-Nov-18 07:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
any skeptic thoughts on btc hitting 3k in coming week(s) ?

[24-Nov-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is the fiat forces doing the manipulation, anything can happen

[24-Nov-18 07:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or how low it can be expected to go?

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
when you can print however many USD you need to manipulate the market, it seems it can go on for a long time

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a quick look on bitcoinwisdom chart makes me think it is indeed manipulation.
3 months of sideways, then down, about 5 days of sideways and then down, and now about 4 days of sideways so far

[24-Nov-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the regulatory attacks and financial attacks that are coordinated, do not seem to be a coincidence

[24-Nov-18 07:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[24-Nov-18 07:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it is affecting kmd price too, like it's affecting any other alternate currency.....

yes, stomp on BTC, stomp on all of crypto

[24-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but it could just be wall street. i think this all started around futures expiration

[24-Nov-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and this could just be a way to buy a lot more BTC at a discount

CoinGeek now feels there is no point in negotiating.  If ABC puts replay protection in to permanently split the chains we will ensure that nobody bothers them again.  They can keep BCH as BSV is not the original Bitcoin Cash its the original Bitcoin.
