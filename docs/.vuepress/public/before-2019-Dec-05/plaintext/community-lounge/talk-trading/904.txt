Coingirl was killed in a boating accident

[09-Jul-19 02:59 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

the problem with KMD price is that people got used to the fact that if BTC rises, KMD has to fall... so they are starting to sell KMD when BTC starts rising... it is a self fulfilling prophecy... but you can change this.... wait till it happens again and then use 100 BTC to buy KMD 😄

[09-Jul-19 03:01 AM] cipi#4502
you only need to do it once or max. twice

[09-Jul-19 03:06 AM] Mark81#4505

Would love to get around 5k kmd but don't know where to pull the trigger when it just keeps falling

[09-Jul-19 03:08 AM] cipi#4502
buy more then once, at 10k, at 7k and at 5k...

[09-Jul-19 03:10 AM] Mark81#4505
Wait when everyone starts to shouting moon. Last couple of days tradingview had many kmd posts for higher prices. Literally top of this run.

[09-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD has price gravity

[09-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Without active rocket burns

[09-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Price falls

[09-Jul-19 03:34 AM] cmiles7888#0621
Looks like support around 1100-1110 so if it gets there maybe worth waiting

[09-Jul-19 03:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vbk still continuing its Jovian descent

BTC Dominance:  63.9% and that is the CMC version which is several percent lower than the tradingview

[09-Jul-19 04:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
please kill bitcoin for us jl777

[09-Jul-19 04:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
save KMD 😄

[09-Jul-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
remember what happened after the last time BTC surged. then paused for a week or so

[09-Jul-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it wasnt that bad

[09-Jul-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine you are on a bicycle pedal, the higher your altitude the better

[09-Jul-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
as you go up the hill, you can freak out each time you go down and almost hit the ground

[09-Jul-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
or just be calm as the bicycle keeps going up the hill

[09-Jul-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
Market Cap:  $351,878,643,451

[09-Jul-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
that is almost half a trillion and already a lot bigger than it was during bear market lows. its just this ride up the BTC dominance it is unpleasant, but it cant last forever

[09-Jul-19 04:41 AM] Sherdogz#6731
How do you come up with these examples... On the spot?

[09-Jul-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[09-Jul-19 04:45 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Nice!

[09-Jul-19 04:50 AM] jl777c#5810
an inverted analogy, where lower is better is a rollercoaster. when BTC dominance is rising, we are in that slow climb to the highest point at the beginning. only when we get to the very top (and at the absolute worst as it is the highest), does the good part actually start

[09-Jul-19 06:51 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the price of a coin dependson a community grow, here community -> market since mostly it means someone is investing in that; KMD seems to me most of the time a stable community: sometimes some new people come, but some old must take money out, hence equilibrium. Every investor has some time to invest ranging from 1 day up to years, depending on their situation, which also changes, after some time you may need the money, so if community not grow after each pump their will be slow decrease to some reasonable quasi-stable level (for good coins - for bad ones - to oblivion )

BTC: I think 1w chart RSI is too high, but very possible 90. That's mean alt's capitulating hard and ATL without apparent support. I closing my trade at 12950 or 12600 and waiting more information. That's my plan.

[09-Jul-19 07:45 AM] Tek#5253
RSI is a shit metric

[09-Jul-19 07:45 AM] Tek#5253
RSI was "overbought" the entire last 6 months of 2017. or was it the entire year

Executive order on the skin design 😛

[09-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@hyperDEX on the flop player on the button is first to act?

[09-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Doesnt make sense tho :p

[09-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or did small blind check, and if so that isnt really clear

[09-Jul-19 08:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Na it is shown it first to act, but you are right BB should be acting first. The video was to show how the game play and animations will look like. @sg777 is that how the backend will handle it?

[09-Jul-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
what a cooler

[09-Jul-19 08:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[09-Jul-19 10:13 AM] Malti#3948
I have K64 don’t get me wrong and liked what they accomplished on the expo. But these kind of announcements don’t communicate professionalism
