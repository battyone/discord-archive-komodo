Lol

[01-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Vertigo#0439
Someone gave them to me for free long ago

[01-Mar-19 01:56 PM] BlockTech#6895
I also got ALL in Komodo at 3$ (-66% today), But then got some ARRR at 0,13KMD/u (-80% today) with some of my KMD and VRSC at 0,3KMD/u (-70% today), feeling bad about that, but i'm sure in 2 years it will all be at least +200% =D.

@BlockTech me too buddy.  
It’s ok though.  This time next year we hope to have you shopping online using z address commerce legitimately.  At that time using your ARRR will be more valuable than whatever the token price is.   Privacy is key!

Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin Failed
Even as cryptocurrency prices have plunged, several big tech companies are working on their own digital tokens for use in text messaging systems.

[01-Mar-19 03:16 PM] jorian#4555
but any hype in crypto is good for prices

[01-Mar-19 03:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[01-Mar-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Well, to that end, if I can watch 📺 and see 1 mention of BTC in a program that isn't a criminal reference I'll be happy

[01-Mar-19 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the trick is not to watch tV and assume anyine smart enough to amke a diffrence is doing that too 😉

you know those whales that bought into kmd like a week ago

[01-Mar-19 03:49 PM] BlackJesus#6161
that was probably huobi lol.

[01-Mar-19 03:52 PM] jorian#4555
thought the same

[01-Mar-19 03:52 PM] jorian#4555
at the time huobi launched, at least 150k KMD was put for sale

[01-Mar-19 03:52 PM] jorian#4555
i don't believe so much KMD to move to huobi by traders

[01-Mar-19 03:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea they have to have their own holdings to allows smaller people to trade within

[01-Mar-19 03:56 PM] Markus#5464

Absurdistan: For $2.5k per day, you can attack Verge (XVG). For $4...
A 51% attack means that 51% of the ‘computer processing power’ used to verify transactions is controlled by one entity, and once this number (51%) has been reached, they can create a new ledger (blockchain ‘fork’ basically) so that they can double spend their own coin...

[01-Mar-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
its abit interesting that verge dont look for protection from komodo

[01-Mar-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
or maybe they did just we dont know about it yet

Will kmd reach 1000 usd? Yes/no

100

[01-Mar-19 08:48 PM] Vertigo#0439
But first $2

[01-Mar-19 08:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@dsalinas79 of course yes, in a few years

[01-Mar-19 09:16 PM] Markus#5464
1000 sounds unbelieveable atm but i quess time will tell

[01-Mar-19 09:16 PM] Markus#5464
if that would happen then wont need to worry about cash thats for sure

[01-Mar-19 09:36 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
It doesn't sound unbelievable considering how the whole crypto is still so small. Sooner or later there will be a coin with over 1 trillion mcap, and even that is still small. Patience. Wait 2025

[01-Mar-19 09:57 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I'm also happy if it reaches $10 again. $100 is not a impossible target but I  hope I will still be alive by then 😂

[02-Mar-19 02:00 AM] Markus#5464
sad to see Huobi also having fake trading, buy orders being like 24.5 and sell 24.9 and then it adds buys/sells to market trade history being 24.7 and so on with nothing moving at all

[02-Mar-19 02:09 AM] Caglio#3337
I would like to trade there

[02-Mar-19 02:09 AM] Caglio#3337
to get free 5 komodos

[02-Mar-19 05:38 AM] Vertigo#0439
This listing thing was not that great lol

[02-Mar-19 07:28 AM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah, I don't like huobi, it is known for fake volume

[02-Mar-19 11:04 AM] yorklab#7270
If Komodo listed on only exchanges that showed real volume there would be very few choices. The more exchanges the better when we start seeing the rebrand.

[02-Mar-19 02:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Exchange listing pumps are a thing of the past it seems. 
For the past 12 months I haven’t witnessed a proper (deserved) listing pump.

[02-Mar-19 02:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I don’t watch all coins but that seems the norm now unless CZ pumps it first.

[02-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Well maybe no pump when its already listed on large exchanges

[02-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I can see arrr pumping with a binance listing ;p

i bought at 98 cents a few days ago so for sure its going down

[02-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Sdunbar#5064
happens pretty much any time i buy

[02-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464
Listing on huobi caused this dump cause price on huobi was 24.5 when it was 27 everywhere else

[02-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Sdunbar#5064
That would draw it down for sure

[02-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Sdunbar#5064
unfortunate

[02-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Although at this point I think as long as crypto doesnt entirely shit the bed this coin should see 2-3 dollars at some point

[02-Mar-19 04:21 PM] Sdunbar#5064
which would be a nice gain for anyone buying more at 97 cents

[02-Mar-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
We will see i quess

[02-Mar-19 04:22 PM] altcoinist#1501
95 cents
