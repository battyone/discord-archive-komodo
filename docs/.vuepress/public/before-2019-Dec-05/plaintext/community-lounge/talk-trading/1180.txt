otherwise they will fail

[25-Oct-19 11:21 PM] Privatoshi#9487
What's your point?

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
normal companies have to succeed in many arenas to survive

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Antara SmartChain Composer, that is a great project

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you cant just be creative

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
most cryptos get a lot of slack compared to non crypto companies

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] Privatoshi#9487
That's geared to businesses or individuals that can't design their own asset chain

[25-Oct-19 11:22 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
because investors are moonbois

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
No moonbois here

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i agree minimal

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
my point though is that crypto companies are not subject to the same market competition at this moment in time

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
they get a lot of passes

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Not this one.

[25-Oct-19 11:23 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
that will not contiune 100%

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i agree less with this one

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
but you already gave them a huge pass

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
with your first statement

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you said they cant dev and market

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
any normal comapny that means death

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Who said they can't dev

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Privatoshi#9487
What?

[25-Oct-19 11:24 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Please dont misquote me.

[25-Oct-19 11:25 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
scroll up and copy

[25-Oct-19 11:25 PM] Privatoshi#9487
```So JL and the other Devs, they're supposed to work on everything, and be expected to market```

[25-Oct-19 11:25 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
yes so you are saying they cant dev and market

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
outside crypto that is death for a company

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Is English your second language?

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
because both are necessary for survival

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
no need to get defensive dude

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i am from england

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
uk

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] Privatoshi#9487
What that means brother is, people expect them to do everything

[25-Oct-19 11:26 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
no not at all

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
people expect the company to do everything because that is what it takes to succeed

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] Privatoshi#9487
They're doing dev work, but people get mad bc they aren't marketing as much as they want

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
so to survive outside crypto that means hiring marketing department

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Well those people, they are concerned with price

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you are exemplifying my point precisely

[25-Oct-19 11:27 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you are holding them to lower standards

[25-Oct-19 11:28 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
because they are in crypto

[25-Oct-19 11:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also Komodo isnâ€™t a company . Many independent persons and groups utilizing same tech

[25-Oct-19 11:30 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Some people just aren't good traders lol..

[25-Oct-19 11:30 PM] Privatoshi#9487

Based on Ethereum, Quorum is an open-source blockchain platform that combines the innovation of the public Ethereum community with enhancements to support enterprise needs.

[25-Oct-19 11:33 PM] Privatoshi#9487
@jl777c was right about this...
Private businesses forking ETH & not using the public chain to avoid tx fees

komodo is what companies thought ethereum was

[25-Oct-19 11:38 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Agreed.
Ethereum is a congested pain in the bass

[25-Oct-19 11:38 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Without a Layer 2 Solution

[25-Oct-19 11:44 PM] Neko#5830
this must be empathized in the marketing when it happens

[25-Oct-19 11:45 PM] Privatoshi#9487

[25-Oct-19 11:46 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Everyone knows they have issues.

[25-Oct-19 11:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Wonder what people are going to do when the bulk of traded kmd isnâ€™t on a CEX

[25-Oct-19 11:49 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Depends on theirs needs

[25-Oct-19 11:50 PM] Privatoshi#9487
If they need it, they'll buy it

[25-Oct-19 11:55 PM] Privatoshi#9487
I wonder if AtomicDex and HyperDex,  could be marketed as the same, on different platforms

[25-Oct-19 11:56 PM] Privatoshi#9487
Android/iOS/Linux/Windows/OsX
