We yet to go bottom for btc

[14-Aug-18 03:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I been saying 2-3k btc since the beginning

[14-Aug-18 03:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
that's where the bottom is

[14-Aug-18 03:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep I think same

[14-Aug-18 03:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It definitely was easier to watch BTC drop from 1300 to 200 than it is to watch 20k to 2k

[14-Aug-18 03:50 AM] BlackJesus#6161
i think the bitcoin companies are going to make their move for bch to overtake btc

[14-Aug-18 03:50 AM] BlackJesus#6161
when it bottoms out

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If they flip it, it will never reflip

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Any news on BCH?

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Haven‚Äôt been following

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
What I missed?

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
besides the biggert bitcoin company holding 10% of all coins none

[14-Aug-18 03:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
bitmain holds 10% of the supply

[14-Aug-18 03:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
and they are going to hold them strong

[14-Aug-18 03:52 AM] jspook16#3059
oh man...

[14-Aug-18 03:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
ACTUALLY 5%

[14-Aug-18 03:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol just said that out loud

[14-Aug-18 03:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I thin k they have about 1.1m

[14-Aug-18 03:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
And they got the coin generation by the nuts

[14-Aug-18 03:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
you'd be dumb to bet against a company that made billions off of bitcoin

[14-Aug-18 03:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I still think btc has one last hurrah left in it.

[14-Aug-18 04:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven‚Äôt looked at my portfolio yet....
Hope it still have some breathing in itüò∂

[14-Aug-18 04:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It looks like the worst time already to be living off of crypto

[14-Aug-18 04:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Could this be national currencies falling affecting crypto?

[14-Aug-18 04:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If so I guess we will see more fall

[14-Aug-18 04:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes it kinda sucks.  But I think this is a planned long squeeze by big players.

[14-Aug-18 04:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Looking at log scale chart we aren‚Äôt even near the middle of bottom squeezing

[14-Aug-18 04:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We just have to outlast them.

[14-Aug-18 04:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
My plans to survive longer with cash are bashed by damn tax payments

[14-Aug-18 04:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Feels a full on rip off

[14-Aug-18 04:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hope to see some recovery soon

[14-Aug-18 04:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Maybe back to 7k-8k somehow

[14-Aug-18 04:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ain't that the truth,  working through the tax nightmare right now myself.

[14-Aug-18 04:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
What the wizards think of this possibility?

[14-Aug-18 04:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@polycryptoblog take a deep breath before filling taxes. There there mate....

My tax was online form... I let it auto fill and couldnt find a bitcoin/crypto box so submitted it, and got a $1300 AUD return üòÑ

[14-Aug-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they already paid me a week later

[14-Aug-18 04:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But my income was minimal from crypto

[14-Aug-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
last year, as notary funds mostly went to hardware etc in the first few months

[14-Aug-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and I am pretty sure "winning" a stress test isnt income.

[14-Aug-18 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its a prize

```Everything you see taking place in the world right now ‚Äî the trade war between the US and China, the ramping up of tensions between the US and Russia, the gaping and growing political divisions in America, the feeling that asset markets might fall over at any minute, even the crackdown of the banking sector in Australia ‚Äî all of it is linked. ```

Shouldve called them prizes too ü§î

[14-Aug-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
where is the `bitcoin` part of the online tax form?

[14-Aug-18 04:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I looked for over 5mins üòÇ

[14-Aug-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think when dealing in hundreds of thousands, or millions it would be wise to pay up, but there is a threshold of profit/loss for tax department just as any business/criminal entity.

[14-Aug-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are only going to bother chasing you if its going to make them money

[14-Aug-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if they are going to lose money, what is the motivation for them?

[14-Aug-18 04:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
especially with crypto, impossible to data mine for every person.

[14-Aug-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
At least for now.

[14-Aug-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That will definatly change in the next few years

[14-Aug-18 04:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
once cash is banned competly

[14-Aug-18 04:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Related to my quote above... crypto predicts stock market. watch in the next few weeks, bigger more important markets start to roll over. Crypto will recover much mcuch faster than anything else, but will take the hit just like everything else. I think 2-3k BTC is probably reasonable. But it depends how deep the pockets are of the people keeping mining profitable.

[14-Aug-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hash rate is still rising constantly... Which makes no sense at all, with a falling price.

[14-Aug-18 04:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
well

[14-Aug-18 04:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I think people are realizing the true hedge on the global fiat economy is math backed currency

[14-Aug-18 04:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
currency that can't be debased on a whim.

[14-Aug-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am a strong beleiver than crypto will flourish in the aftermath or the collapse. And BCH is currently nearly the only coin that can scale close to the needed TX/s

[14-Aug-18 04:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
BCH is a very heavy short term play right now

[14-Aug-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Everyone hates on it, but when we need a medium of exchange, thats probably going to be the easiest to use internationally for payments/settlemnts

[14-Aug-18 04:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm thinking 250-300 bottom

[14-Aug-18 04:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
