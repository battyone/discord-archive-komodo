[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] ryman112#0068
That logo got me smh.  I mean that shit is spot on identical

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Caglio#3337
What do you think of EOS ?

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Caglio#3337
I am thinking of buying some

[16-Jul-19 02:50 AM] ryman112#0068
What does their logo look like?

[16-Jul-19 02:51 AM] Caglio#3337
Well I dont think they need to re-re-brand themselves üòÑ

[16-Jul-19 02:52 AM] ryman112#0068
They will if they get sue sued

[16-Jul-19 02:53 AM] Caglio#3337
I think @shrk should get a job at KMD, I mean dude found out a copied logo in like few mins

[16-Jul-19 02:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Ya i gotta say that logo is almost a clone

[16-Jul-19 02:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
pretty close

[16-Jul-19 02:58 AM] Sdunbar#5064
wonder if they were aware of that one

[16-Jul-19 02:59 AM] Sdunbar#5064
website looks great

[16-Jul-19 02:59 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i didnt mind the logo tbh either but worrisome that is a damn near clone of that centricity logo

[16-Jul-19 03:01 AM] ryman112#0068
How could they not be aware?  Ideas by nature are the best right?

[16-Jul-19 03:04 AM] Caglio#3337

[16-Jul-19 03:06 AM] ryman112#0068
Merger just to get the logo lol ok ok Im listening go on

[16-Jul-19 03:10 AM] Caglio#3337

[16-Jul-19 03:13 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Looks like how the 2019 bananas in Pajamas are compared to old school

That‚Äôs part of the rebrand @Caglio, rebranding the logo. I mean I liked the old logo, but the new one is cool too

[16-Jul-19 03:27 AM] Caglio#3337
Old one was original, this one is not, we should have used adidas, or batman symbol instead

[16-Jul-19 03:27 AM] ryman112#0068
Dude just stop lmao

[16-Jul-19 03:27 AM] Alecandro#1179
