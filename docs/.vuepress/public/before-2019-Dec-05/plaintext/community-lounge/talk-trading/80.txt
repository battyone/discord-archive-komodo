They needed to pump to afford that obscure creedmoor ammo

[03-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
They don‚Äôt have a reloading setup yet

[03-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nevermind the .50 Beowulf I want is even worse price-wise than creedmoor

[03-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Sherdogz#6731
This looks like pump n dump

[03-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Creedmoors only $1 a shot üòÇ

[03-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Beowulf is $1.30/rd

even if the pump isn't sustenaible, getting so much attention is good

May want to take the shot

[03-Aug-18 12:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
If this pump really is a thing

[03-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then again the 12 says otherwise

5 part down on the 1 hour could be the first part down on the 12

[03-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

(on very short period of course so not trying to make a point here :p )

Rarely do I look at 12 hour, let alone 1 hour

[03-Aug-18 12:51 PM] Malti#3948
yea I'm not saying it's an indicator

[03-Aug-18 12:51 PM] Malti#3948
