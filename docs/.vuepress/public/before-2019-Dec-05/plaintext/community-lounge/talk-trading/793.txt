just not our style

[21-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Markus#5464
tron also have so many gambling dapps its ridiculous and ppl love those for some reason

[21-Jun-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe hollowman can start doing publicity stunts

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We have to work with what we have, but would be good to find out, beyond these things, what else attracts people to these projects

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
gambling is way of life

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
those 'dapps" are all centralized

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
make app and thats all

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio CHIPS will be a gateway drug for KMD ðŸ˜ƒ

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
i really dp

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
i cannot way to gamble away all of my money and then accuse @jl777c  that he rigged roulette

[21-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Caglio#3337
wait*

[21-Jun-19 11:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The thing with KMD is that, it takes people to step up and take initiative. I dont want to blow my own trumpet but i saw a need, so i found a way to do it.

[21-Jun-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If everyone could do this, i am sure KMD would have a great value due to the active community participation

[21-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Caglio#3337
we do have a nice community here

[21-Jun-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Right now everyone is waiting for James and the team to do the tech, do the marketing and solve all the issues we have.

[21-Jun-19 11:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But we need to take some responsibility over our own investments and make sure we do everything we can to make it worth more.

[21-Jun-19 11:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It doesnt matter if you have 1 KMD or 1million KMD, everyone needs to pitch in, and when we do, the value naturally will go up.

[21-Jun-19 11:28 AM] jkluwu0499#8218
Make a Dapp competition like the previous infographic might be able to attract new devs

[21-Jun-19 11:28 AM] Markus#5464
i think ppl wait on Ideas By Nature to do the magic but there is not much news and seem to take very long time

[21-Jun-19 11:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
James told me once, it is better to have a few GUIs than none. Why wait for something outside of your control when you can do something about it ðŸ˜›

[21-Jun-19 11:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Website design/marketing/tech developments, these are things most of us cannot control nor know when they will happen. But you have control over telling people about KMD tech, suggesting ideas, helping with community events/testing.

[21-Jun-19 11:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
All these little things adds up!

[21-Jun-19 11:31 AM] Markus#5464
very hard to come up with ideas especially when it comes to tech cause most of times its already in the making or done

[21-Jun-19 11:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you watch youtube videos or read stuff on reddit/steemit?

[21-Jun-19 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there someone that posts/does a live show that you think would like to look into KMD?

[21-Jun-19 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Send them $1 and ask them, have you looked into KMD?

[21-Jun-19 11:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Im not very technical but i still ask silly technical questions about things that can and cant be done, im not a marketer but i still suggest avenues of marketing that might be good for the marketing team.

[21-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Tek#5253
damn

[21-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[21-Jun-19 11:48 AM] Tek#5253

[21-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Tek#5253

That TA says KMD is going negative 5k sats. As in James and company is going to pay us for wanting Komodo.

[21-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Malti#3948
@Tek but you're not a pirate so you have to pay to dock ðŸ˜‰

[21-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
i would say we will get a bounce from 13-14k area up to 18-20k within 1-2 weeks, then if news from Antara will get recognized then well hopefully price below 20k could be last time

[21-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Tek#5253
i only slept like 3 hours this night cause I watned to check the btc run
