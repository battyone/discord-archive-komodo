My old piece of shit ex-miner computer won’t run it

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Cli only for that machine

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Japesmith#0609
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies Technically they only offer a wallet, and the joy of being KYCed to use it

[10-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Japesmith wtf

[10-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
KYC to use a wallet?

[10-Oct-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Agama is heavy on system resources`
well, it is an app within an app using a service to connect to another app, so there's that

[10-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Japesmith#0609
Yeh you have to enter personal details. It's a custodial wallet. And the miner is pretend mining (for anyone that didn't know)

[10-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 whatever it is, the amd sempron can’t handle it

[10-Oct-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2004 called, they said "upgrade"

[10-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Was an ultra budget build

[10-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Been considering upgrading the processor

[10-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bought ammo instead

[10-Oct-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Why is no one here surprised by that 🤔

[10-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
:abusedsmily:

[10-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Japesmith#0609
Also @meatspoon, I think Electroneum's name and logo are awful 😛

[10-Oct-18 12:50 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pirate should be renamed neutrino

Passes through the entire cryptosphere without interacting with any known exchanges

[10-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Japesmith#0609
@Hollowman9000 Here you go https://electroneum.com/2018/10/05/etn-becomes-worlds-first-kyc-compliant-cryptocurrency/

[10-Oct-18 12:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
They are horrible, Jape. Agreed. But is KMD any better?  An octagon?

[10-Oct-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`mass of [which] is much smaller than that of the other known elementary particles`
Yeah, that's what we should name a new coin we want to grow 👆🏼

[10-Oct-18 12:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
Most of the logos in the crypto space are pretty non-impressive.

[10-Oct-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[10-Oct-18 12:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
I guess its what you get when programmers make logos.

[10-Oct-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's so cute that you think most coins have programmers

[10-Oct-18 12:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
I knew a condescending comment was coming

[10-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Japesmith#0609
@meatspoon Yeh I never really got the komodo branding stuff. Including the lizard stuff (I guess JL likes lizards?)

[10-Oct-18 12:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
Dunno. But yeah, i agree

[10-Oct-18 12:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
At traditional companies an art director and lead artists will work for weeks on a tiny logo.  In the crypto space it seems like pretty important decisions like this just get decided by a programmer or two without much thought.

[10-Oct-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*Maybe* 10 % of coins have anyone that can code at any level, and I doubt more than 50% of that 10% has even 1 that can do so with any notable ability.

[10-Oct-18 12:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, then that must be true since you cant be wrong. Again, thanks for sharing your infallible opinion.

[10-Oct-18 12:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
He's not far off. A large percent of coins are just bitcoin clones which anyone with google can make and start hyping.

[10-Oct-18 12:58 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or erc20 tokens

[10-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I paid a lot of money for bitcoin pyrite’s logo

[10-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Japesmith#0609
Same with pivx clones and cryptonote forks

[10-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don’t question our legitimacy within this space

[10-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

self portrait?

[10-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
How many coins have been told they can't have dPoW because of using old bitcoin coding? I know of a few that came into this discord that were informed "sorry, 2010 wallet no work"

[10-Oct-18 01:01 PM] meatspoon#7860
Is that a hat he is wearing or a Hodl cooking pot?

[10-Oct-18 01:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not for DPoW really but BarterDEX

[10-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Now I can never unsee a pot on his head.

[10-Oct-18 01:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
I kinda like it more if its an improvised helmet

[10-Oct-18 01:02 PM] meatspoon#7860
That dude is ready to hodl on no matter if the sky falls

[10-Oct-18 01:07 PM] snowdamn#2414

[10-Oct-18 01:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[10-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Japesmith#0609
You offering?

[10-Oct-18 01:09 PM] Japesmith#0609
We can do this today if you want 😬

[10-Oct-18 01:39 PM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Wait wait.. some interest in kmd right now.. trading volume picked up a bit :)

[10-Oct-18 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[10-Oct-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all that dumping @ 17k, it was bound to pick up eventually

[10-Oct-18 01:48 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592

[10-Oct-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is just hoping  __someone __ want's to buy it :trollface:_

[10-Oct-18 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
$/time I can't think of a coin I've more heavily invested in

[10-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s Liberia armor

[10-Oct-18 01:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aka pot on head

[10-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Mark81#4505
Why is KMD spiking? Did i miss something?

[10-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
lol

[10-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
4% is a spike nowadays

[10-Oct-18 02:04 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I remember the days of 1200% pumps on polo

[10-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Take profit, move to the few remaining coins that weren’t pumped yet, wait

[10-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wash rinse repeat

[10-Oct-18 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_remembers the days when 3 cents wasn't a "spike"_

[10-Oct-18 02:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well when the shitcoin was trading at .00009 cents prior :abusedsmily:

[10-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
So many orders now that 100k order

[10-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probs that binance whale again LOL

[10-Oct-18 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 I was talking about KMD 😛

[10-Oct-18 02:27 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
WOOOOOOAAAAH

[10-Oct-18 02:27 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
now it's really going.

[10-Oct-18 02:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@jl777c you doin this :>?

[10-Oct-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wake me when it hits 33k, till then all it is doing is recovering

[10-Oct-18 02:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
that will take some time 😛

[10-Oct-18 02:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
soo much selling pressure

[10-Oct-18 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`soo much selling pressure`
Maybe because people are acting like 4 cents is a "big move"? :trollface:

[10-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Japesmith#0609
Just ordered a yacht

[10-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jorian#4555
why is every big move assumed to be jl777?

[10-Oct-18 02:34 PM] jorian#4555
he already swims in KMD

[10-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Yassin#3685
dPoW!! 🚀

[10-Oct-18 02:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
because he repeatedely notes that kmd is the thing he bought most of

[10-Oct-18 02:35 PM] jorian#4555
he made the thing

[10-Oct-18 02:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
bought / buys

[10-Oct-18 02:36 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, he still buys more.

[10-Oct-18 02:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it was joke btw, don't think he buys on exchanges, rather otc

[10-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ph03nix#3115
🐓

[10-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
When you already have more of CoinX than you'll ever need, you don't continue to buy uphill

[10-Oct-18 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
😛

[10-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
heh, my bookmark for KMD/BTC is at 0.00046993
might explain why I find 17 to 17.7 an unimpressive change

Pump over

[10-Oct-18 03:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_looks at price, scratches head, can't figure out what "pump" there is **to** be "over"_

[10-Oct-18 03:00 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Whale knew how to play the bots and bought more.

[10-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
In flat land, every pebble is a pump
