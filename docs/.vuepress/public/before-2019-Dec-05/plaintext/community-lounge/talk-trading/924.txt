[15-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Caglio#3337
It is, I only dislike not being able to drink in coffee shops, but on the other hand, if I got drunk there, I would probably beat up a bicyclist or two... I cant stand them driving around

[15-Jul-19 03:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Prague has underground bars the deeper you go the better it gets

[15-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Caglio#3337
I am just not used to them

[15-Jul-19 03:22 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I cannot stand Italians tho

[15-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tell them to make spaghetti

[15-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Caglio#3337
They speak only Italian, so whenever they ask you for some kind of direction, and you politely explain that u cannot speak their language, they still continue asking you same thing on Italian, like somehow you learned it in those 2 minutes

[15-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Speak Spanish to them

[15-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs essentially the same thing

[15-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Insist on this point

[15-Jul-19 03:29 PM] Caglio#3337
