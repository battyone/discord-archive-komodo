with lock time 1560183417 i can get rewards?

[10-Jun-19 04:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think they have, unless you count the "establish big leveraged short position, dump on market, cash in on leveraged position, buy back in market to  cover losses on the dump"

well, if it is set incorrectly that wont be good

[10-Jun-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but that was set to a very recent time, so the one hour is not elapsed yet

[10-Jun-19 04:38 PM] gcharang#6833
the network won't accept the txn if it is set incorrectly?

`the network won't accept the txn if it is set incorrectly?`
if it's off by "a little", it will go; if it's off by a meaningful amount, it will not

and it depends on future vs past. if you can set a locktime 29 days in the past, that means infinite rewards

[10-Jun-19 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if you can set a locktime 29 days in the past, that means infinite rewards`
aka why the coin that shall not be named commented out all rewards because they broke them and let that happen :troll:

You know you can long $ARRR? 

Just buy and hold. 
It’s 1x leverage but at least you won’t get @BitmexRekt

[10-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So are they spammers that are already banned by twitter, or people that have blocked me and are trolling so I cant see it?

maybe something to do with kmd not having privacy features anymore

[11-Jun-19 05:24 AM] Markus#5464
JL knew it was coming so he was prepared well in time

[11-Jun-19 05:24 AM] Markus#5464
clever move

[11-Jun-19 06:10 AM] LocoMB#8593
ummm.. how does KMD _not_ have privacy features any more?

[11-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
z transactions were disabled after sprout coin printing bug

[11-Jun-19 06:11 AM] LocoMB#8593
ha. I was not aware of that.. but then ofc there is Pirate chain that _only_ has z TXs

[11-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Alright#0419
z transactions will be segregated to a side chain to mitigate the effect of another coin printing bug if one happens

[11-Jun-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@LocoMB read https://cryptolux.org/images/d/d9/Zcash.pdf

[11-Jun-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
only the chain with the absolute largest anon set is the most private. with <1% KMD i zaddr, it is 4x worse than zcash, which is 96% taddr (used to be 85% taddr)

[11-Jun-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want privacy, use PIRATE

[11-Jun-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
granted zaddr usage done properly can provide fantastic levels of privacy, but in an optional privacy chain, the user needs to not make a mistake

[11-Jun-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
with an all privacy chain like PIRATE, even if you tried to lose your privacy, short of publishing your viewkeys, it is very hard to lose the privacy

Looks like @KomodoWorld is on board to try to win http://binancecup.tronbet.io/ @polycryptoblog  get the passport ready.

Is anyone else looking to help fund such a effort? We need to get some TRX but if we dont win we will get the TRX back to KMD (so there might be a risk of less or more funds than we started with). I think the exposure of KMD/CHIPS from this even might be worth the 10k we chuck into this. Justin being a serial hype machine and our mate CZ being there too with Charlie Lee. I am sure there would be enough coverage to be worth the effort.

Hit me up if you want to contribute to this community marketing effort.

I don't understand how people use BTC as a currency. It takes hours to get any transactions through and costs a fortune.

[11-Jun-19 11:31 AM] Malti#3948
yeah, it's just the gateway to KMD

[11-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Malti#3948
i don't remember who it was but the tweet "I'm bullish on BTC as it allows me to buy KMD" was gold

[11-Jun-19 11:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahaha yeah true, and ARRR 😃

[11-Jun-19 11:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm loving the cheap price of ARRR as well. Need to buy up so I can afford a boat with it
