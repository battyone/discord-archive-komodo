[04-Jun-19 11:10 PM] richardt#2807
likely OTC

[04-Jun-19 11:10 PM] Markus#5464

[04-Jun-19 11:22 PM] Alexfrog#1338

what is supernet?

[04-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
why does it matter?

[04-Jun-19 11:29 PM] Tek#5253
@richardt

[04-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Alexfrog#1338
just some jl777 scam that never pays out üòõ

[04-Jun-19 11:30 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[04-Jun-19 11:58 PM] richardt#2807
It's the asset that started everything (KMD related), so it has at least some historical value üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 12:00 AM] Alecandro#1179
Daily close yeee

[05-Jun-19 12:06 AM] richardt#2807
@Tek :  If you're looking for the ultimate hodl in crypto, SuperNET is probably it.  I believe ICO price in 2014 was ~$5 per asset.  5 years later, it's about $20-$30 per asset.  Although it's difficult to determine market value due to infrequent trading of this asset

[05-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Tek#5253
@richardt redpill / holdpill me on supernet

[05-Jun-19 12:06 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so what youre saying is it massively underperformed crypto market üòõ

[05-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[05-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Tek#5253
mfw he's actually correct.

[05-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Alexfrog#1338
+400% in 5 years?  what a shitty asset üòÑ

[05-Jun-19 12:07 AM] Tek#5253

[05-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[05-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Tek#5253
yeah its turning bull again

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Tek#5253
seems like we aren't dropping to 6k

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Tek#5253
atleast not yet

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] richardt#2807
haha yes, it's a very shitty performer compared to a lot of stuff.  But it's only been up overall since the ICO.

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Tek#5253
why exactly does supernet hold 9 mil kmd

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Tek#5253
is it an entitiy

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Tek#5253
i dont understand

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338
its more like a mutual fund run by jl777

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338
of kmd assets

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Alexfrog#1338

Nav for Supernet

[05-Jun-19 12:10 AM] richardt#2807
It's a "hodling" asset

[05-Jun-19 12:10 AM] Alexfrog#1338
wait, it now has 9.6M KMD?

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] allbits#5898
It's about to pay out a dividend of about fifty cents per asset

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
it was like 7M a couple weeks ago and 8.3M or so last week

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Tek#5253
whalebro is the supernet entitiy?

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] richardt#2807
Yup, jl777 has been adding more to the fund.  I think he's pretty confident KMD will only go up from here

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Tek#5253
doubt he got more than 1000 BTC filled

[05-Jun-19 12:11 AM] allbits#5898
