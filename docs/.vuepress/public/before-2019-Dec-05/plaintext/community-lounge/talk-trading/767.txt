That volume drain doesnt look good

[15-Jun-19 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
Look at the larger context... the volume is trending lower since 22.6k

[15-Jun-19 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
Plus, we just changed "days" little over an hour ago so there isn't any telling what this weekend could bring

[15-Jun-19 01:18 AM] bishop#9773
but good convergence level nonetheless

[15-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c is there a bounty on the hacker?

[15-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have possibly misunderstood komodoworld‚Äôs tweet

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] bishop#9773
No, he's saying that the coins the hacker took are the bounty

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] bishop#9773
for showing an attack vector in Agama

[15-Jun-19 01:27 AM] bishop#9773
and that because they are treated as normal coins, they remain fungible

[15-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Understood, the way it was worded was questionable, didn‚Äôt know if I had missed something

[15-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Especially with the give-up clause, possibly keep half

[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If they‚Äôre fungible, why cut your booty in half

[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] bishop#9773
Yeah, I;m not sure why that line was thrown in personally

[15-Jun-19 01:51 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
When we receive on ledger, address changes every time you receive

[15-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
is it still okay to send to old ledger address? Also are rewards automatically claimed everytime we receive

[15-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
(do they send whole balance to the new receive address?) sorry for stupid question üòõ

It hasn‚Äôt been officially clarified yet

[15-Jun-19 03:31 AM] nael55#5863
dm if you need partner. we can split the loot

[15-Jun-19 03:54 AM] Punk#1349
@Crabby Paddy Yes you can reuse a ledger address. The purpose of a different address  each time is to remain more private. Of course, when sending large amounts, 
I still send a small amount first to confirm the funds go into my wallet then I send the balance.

[15-Jun-19 04:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Crabby Paddy if you are using the ledger claim it will send it to the new address. If you want to be on the safe side, open up the ledger app and check the new receive address it generates, then when you do the claim it should be sending it to the same address

[15-Jun-19 04:10 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Thanks @hyperDEX is that just a ‚Äúfor peace of mind‚Äù or has it happened to send to wrong address before for people?

[15-Jun-19 04:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Piece of mind for the paranoid

[15-Jun-19 04:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Even if that page was hacked, the address generated should be 100% what ledger shows, you just need to make sure before confirming the tx that the address shown on the screen matches what you are confirming on the ledger

[15-Jun-19 04:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
When Luke has some spare time, he will package the webpage so people can download it locally

[15-Jun-19 04:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Then a hack of the website wont make any difference

after your antics during the Komodo attack that yielded just a bare fraction of what you hoped to pilfer, let me recommend an easier and much jucier target for your efforts:

You can thank me later. Send me a split of the loot for giving the hint.

I want to see results @Hollowman9000

[15-Jun-19 10:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
confused about the facebook coin. So no rewards to validators from what I can see, but they have to pay 10m to become a part of the libra team or whatever they call it

[15-Jun-19 10:43 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Presumeably that means you have to pay / become a validator to accept payments or allow useage of the coin on their platform?

[15-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Is facebook calling it a "cryptocurrency" themselves? Or is that just coming from the rumours and crypto people

[15-Jun-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you pay 10 million to get access to the transaction data

[15-Jun-19 10:46 AM] crumb#2550
at least partly, you can look at this as a big marketing event. crypto is "IN" now and everybody wants to show they are on board and this makes them "cool" now

a small cost to be able to see all payments done by all the users

[15-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so similar to selling data

[15-Jun-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is exactly the same

[15-Jun-19 10:47 AM] phm87#7395
Is it illegal to spam facebook with fake data ? Order stuff and cancel orders

[15-Jun-19 10:47 AM] crumb#2550
just how does that fit into Mark Zuckerbergs' "We are all about privacy now!" narrative?

[15-Jun-19 10:48 AM] crumb#2550
answer: it doesn't

[15-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I wonder how the governments and laws will react to this especially the borderless / taxless payments

[15-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I mean, facebook is pretty big to be fair

[15-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
govts will love this, it adds to their 5 eyes initiative

until some big scandal comes along. which will inevitably happen

[15-Jun-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but any scandal is spun

[15-Jun-19 10:51 AM] crumb#2550
and then two weeks later, everybody has forgotten it again and go back to using it

[15-Jun-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
big media is controlled

[15-Jun-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
big scandals become about some celebrity nonsense

[15-Jun-19 10:53 AM] crumb#2550
perhaps not so much controlled by some specific entity, but controlled by its business model. which is bringing in eyeballs

[15-Jun-19 10:54 AM] crumb#2550
just what james said

[15-Jun-19 10:57 AM] crumb#2550
scandals, violence, and of course half-naked celebrities and other social media "influencers"

[15-Jun-19 10:58 AM] crumb#2550
loads of people who are famous, for being famous. no other skill needed.

[15-Jun-19 10:59 AM] crumb#2550
sad thing is that some (quite a lot actually) young people follow blindly their advice

[15-Jun-19 11:01 AM] crumb#2550
so it seems that it is not so important to do what is good for you or common sense, but just do what is "IN" at any given moment

[15-Jun-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
nowadays this is formalized as people get paid a lot of money just because they have millions of followers

[15-Jun-19 11:03 AM] crumb#2550
and somehow this qualifies them to give advice?

[15-Jun-19 11:03 AM] crumb#2550
which is not advice, but rather paid promotion anyways

[15-Jun-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
they have millions of followers, so that is proof they are smart enough to be followed, right?

[15-Jun-19 11:04 AM] crumb#2550
:abusedsmily:

[15-Jun-19 11:05 AM] crumb#2550
smart enough to take their shirt off and snap a picture perhaps yes

[15-Jun-19 11:06 AM] crumb#2550
don't get me wrong, i love some nice titties, but that does not mean i listen to their "advice"

[15-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I don't get it though

[15-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
If it is a blockchain, then people should be able to use explorer

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And everyone can see it

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] crumb#2550
how much of that stuff is blockchain, remains to be seen

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you assume it is a blockchain?

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
If it's not a blockchain, then it's not even a crypto

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] crumb#2550
of course not

[15-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
