there is no gui still üò¶

[17-Sep-18 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah we will start on this soon dude, it got put on back bruner. I have a CLI game that is automated will try and get it working for coqui today if I get time, no promises though

[17-Sep-18 12:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
awesome

[17-Sep-18 12:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have some doubts still

[17-Sep-18 12:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example, would it be possible to use spv client for a dice game?

[17-Sep-18 12:53 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So log in like agama web and just interact with a simple dice game gui?

[17-Sep-18 12:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is a way to play the game that work just about 100% of the time, the logic to get that working on a continuous loop was a bit tricky, but I don't figure people gamble that fast or that much with "real money"

[17-Sep-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Quite sure it needs a full node

[17-Sep-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Facing same problems with MoMoM as that needs the full node of KMD running locally to work at this stage. I don't thinks its out of possibility to use some kind of centralised server to broadcast transactions and fetch transactions. But not sure how much effort that would be to make.

[17-Sep-18 01:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but in theory if electrumx is modified it could work, right?

[17-Sep-18 01:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Bit out of my skills to answer that 100% but I think so yes.

[17-Sep-18 01:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There would be a signing part of the tx creation, simply separating that call from the code and doing that part locally before broadcasting to the server, at least I think that's how it works.

[17-Sep-18 01:11 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lets see how it goes.

[17-Sep-18 02:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[17-Sep-18 03:00 AM] jspook16#3059
you could try restarting yours if you want or maybe wait a few mins to see if it syncs up

[17-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bout to hit the sack, I‚Äôll let the computers do the talking

[17-Sep-18 03:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[17-Sep-18 03:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for creating raw TX, you need to learn JQ filters

[17-Sep-18 03:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can do fucking anything with those so easily.

[17-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
