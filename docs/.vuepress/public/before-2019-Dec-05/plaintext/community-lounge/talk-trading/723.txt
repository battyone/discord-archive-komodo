Direct quote from someone who lost 350k day trading:

"I'm not sure if I learnt anything because I still lose money to this day."

Losing money to the market and "paying your tution" does not guarantee that you'll make it.

[02-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Keppie#5156
@grumpygoron Yup same thing. Mine is showing Ethereum posts that have nothing to do with $kmd. It even bolds out the word 'ethereum'

[02-Jun-19 04:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
that person should probably read this channel more

[02-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
That feeling of trying to make a quick buck makes people lose money

Hell, if someone held dogecoin for 3 years, he outperformed S&P by the thousands.

[02-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Zatoichi#0397
is there anything planned for komodo of what was implemented on binance, like launchpad of some sort?

[02-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Zatoichi#0397
though liquidity of binance is surely uncomparable

[02-Jun-19 05:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Kmd has everything needed to do a "launchpad"

[02-Jun-19 05:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Not centralizrd, tho

[02-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
what binance coin is gonna pump?

[02-Jun-19 06:35 PM] Tek#5253
not seeing anything juicy

[02-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Markus#5464
kmd :troll_king:

[02-Jun-19 07:32 PM] Tek#5253

@Keppie glad to know it‚Äôs not just me.  It bolds EOS for me as well making it look like that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm searching for.  So strange you have the same issue but with Ethereum instead of Eos

[02-Jun-19 08:41 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Nvm, now searching $KMD gives me results for $BTT...wtf is Twitter doing üò≠

[02-Jun-19 08:43 PM] Alexfrog#1338
try searching for KMD not $KMD

[02-Jun-19 08:46 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Yeah that works, so does the #KMD.  I‚Äôve just been using the ‚Äú$‚Äù for years, old habits die hard üòÇ

[02-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Zatoichi#0397

[03-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
I usually buy @ coinbase, send to binance

[03-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Caglio#3337
and trade there

[03-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Markus#5464
most of coins from the ecosystem are not listed on high volume exchanges

[03-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, so how to obtain those

Cause whalebro keeps buying and never runs out of btc....i dont rly have a good enough argument for it but just something i thought of üòÑ

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
yeah man he's been buying for months now

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] dokrates#8987
@Markus cz bots are selling and whalebro is buying üòâ

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
wtf

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Markus#5464
But then again whalebro might have been reason for kmd dropping from 28k to 14k

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Markus#5464
he wanted to get it cheaper

[03-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[03-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Tek#5253
he made it pump from 14k to 28k too

[03-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Tek#5253
he probably already owns 10 mil KMD

[03-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Tek#5253
reeeeeeeeeeeee

[03-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Tek#5253

[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] Tek#5253
