seems pretty bullish ATM

[18-May-19 11:57 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeah, everytime before the next IEO , it will pump

[18-May-19 11:58 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the lottery counting will start tomorrow, so everybody will start buying

[18-May-19 11:59 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
all IEO projects on binance were pumping hard, so now everybody wants to get in their next  IEO

[18-May-19 11:59 PM] JimD#9272
Hrm, ICOs powered a lot of the last bull market so I wonder if IEOs can power the next

[19-May-19 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What about bittIRS IEOâ€™s

[19-May-19 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Theyâ€™ve firmly established themselves as cryptocancer

[19-May-19 12:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
only BNB IEOs are doing great, everything else is crashing hard ðŸ˜„

[19-May-19 12:00 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

We were doing already great, but we are going beyond the madness. So since a week we have been in deep negotiations, filed some crazy paperwork. The result is that we got some serious backing. And we are talking about 78M funding for this year. #ToTheMoon #k64

[19-May-19 12:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I kid, I was only loosely familiar with it, I joined their discord but never visit

[19-May-19 12:16 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[19-May-19 12:16 AM] SHossain#0007

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where did you sell it

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Thereâ€™s absolutely no market depth

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
On heat exchange anyway

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
HEAT moves so slow , makes K64 looks like a supersonic jet against turtle

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I sold on heat exchange

[19-May-19 12:21 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[19-May-19 12:22 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[19-May-19 12:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

[19-May-19 12:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
