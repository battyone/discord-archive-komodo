yes, the entire "alt" concept is that it must be an *alternative* to something and no one in this space sees it as meaning an alternative to fiat, but rather an alternative to Bitcoin (which means that you're on the defensive from the start by forcing yourself to show Bitcoin is "lesser than")

can one or more of the TA guys in here share their thoughts about the hourly BTC chart?  With so many big red/green dildos and Bart Simpson style movements, it seems to me that this gentle, rounded swell preceded by 40+ sideways candles is very unusual.

[22-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Likewise#6767
BTC, still same range, my bias is still bearish, guess we will range around a bit more before attempting to push through the 3200 low in a few days/weeks.

[22-Jan-19 11:41 PM] Likewise#6767
in bullish scenario we need to break above 4200 for any meaningful run. Not going to happen IMO, TA looks horrible, macro fundamentals are not telling us a clear story. ETF's, will know final decision on 27/2/2019, Bakkt ?

[22-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Likewise#6767

thanks for your input, @Likewise .  But I guess i was more interested in an explanation or theory as to the specific 1-hour pattern that formed.  I have been watching for a long time and it seemed very different than normal.  A long sideways movement, then a gentle but significant positive wave pattern starting from a deep red candle wick.

[23-Jan-19 03:45 AM] Likewise#6767

```“Cryptocurrencies do not fulfil any of the three purposes of money. They are neither a good means of payment, nor a good unit of account, nor are they suitable as a store of value. They fail dramatically on each of these counts,” he claimed.```

[23-Jan-19 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Yeah, because USD is a "store of value" 🤣
Well, I guess that it is, even losing 1% a year is still "storing" it 😛

[23-Jan-19 02:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
as long as Core pushes to make it a commodity and BTC remains "on top", actual "electronic cash" platforms will suffer

[23-Jan-19 02:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
value is also determined by systems incorporating BTC / adoption. It is on every crypto exchange as basis, in many other crypto payments, and so on... many services allow payments in BTC (however probably rarely used)....  adoption maybe leads the price? if KMD was in every core crypto related app - it could get BTC market cap

[23-Jan-19 02:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
untill we see apps masively change BTC for another token BTC should stay top ?
