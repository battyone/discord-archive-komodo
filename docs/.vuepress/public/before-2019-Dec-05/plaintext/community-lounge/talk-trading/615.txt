[08-May-19 07:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[08-May-19 07:55 PM] SHossain#0007

[08-May-19 07:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[08-May-19 08:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
wow, KMD price on binance is so much higher than elsewhere

[08-May-19 08:50 PM] blubbi#0643
5%

[08-May-19 08:56 PM] Alexfrog#1338

@Alexfrog binance is it’s own universe right now

[08-May-19 11:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Things are great in the komodoverse of binance

[08-May-19 11:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Once the gates open, crash to reality

[08-May-19 11:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah

[08-May-19 11:13 PM] Alexfrog#1338
hopefully stabilize higher though

[08-May-19 11:30 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
damn kmd price j dropped from 1.20 to 1.08 everywhere except for binance

[08-May-19 11:31 PM] yorklab#7270
Bitcoin took a big dip but Binance issues has helped KMD stay up.

[08-May-19 11:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Binance at 202, bittrex at 188?  what is this

[08-May-19 11:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338
whalebro btc stuck on binance, he cant arb it

[08-May-19 11:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what are you alls price predictions for the end of Q2, assuming that the redesign and new products launch as expected

[08-May-19 11:39 PM] Alexfrog#1338
kmd should outperform the market, thats all i can predict

[08-May-19 11:40 PM] Alexfrog#1338
its crypto so it will follow crypto

[08-May-19 11:40 PM] designer#4893
why is deal often cut off in Coinbene?

[08-May-19 11:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530

👌 

[08-May-19 11:42 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
when do you guys think the point will come where btc will take a plunge while the rest of the market continues upward

[08-May-19 11:42 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
as people start to prefer more useful adn versatile systems

[08-May-19 11:45 PM] yorklab#7270
I think when the other systems are being heavily used in real world use cases then they will not move so much with bitcoin.

[09-May-19 01:05 AM] yorklab#7270
Bitcoin has breached 6000 and has so far settled there.

[09-May-19 01:06 AM] Vertigo#0439
Hold on tigh breached 6k alts going down

[09-May-19 01:06 AM] Vertigo#0439
BTC frenzy incoming

[09-May-19 01:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Pretty sure alts have already been beaten to death

[09-May-19 01:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hodlers and wash bots

[09-May-19 01:08 AM] Vertigo#0439
Is a wash bot technically a washer machine?

[09-May-19 01:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Wash bots will lose their ass when hodlers bite on artificially low prices

[09-May-19 01:09 AM] Vertigo#0439
Time to wait for alt season...

[09-May-19 01:10 AM] Vertigo#0439
Now again KMD behaves strangely most of the time lol

[09-May-19 01:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If BTC rise >= 5%
Set buy -0.0001000 satoshis
Set sell -0.0001000 satoshis

[09-May-19 01:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So on so forth until it breaks

[09-May-19 01:11 AM] Vertigo#0439
Pirate even worse

[09-May-19 01:11 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Error: zero balance

[09-May-19 01:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[09-May-19 01:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Whalebro is a bot

[09-May-19 01:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338

[09-May-19 01:18 AM] Alexfrog#1338
kmd bucking the trend was fun while it lasted

[09-May-19 01:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It’s just binance dumping

[09-May-19 01:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everywhere else is still in the same range

[09-May-19 01:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They never left reality

[09-May-19 01:19 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Only safubucks did

[09-May-19 01:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
American scammers flee to SEA

[09-May-19 01:20 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Where the fuck do SEA scammers flee to?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Africa?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Greenland?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
did anyone actually look at that tx? It comes directly out of their hot wallet with a single tx, no? How can they be claiming it was accounts being compromised?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Criminal Island?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ahhhhh

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Alright#0419
like how can multiple accounts do a single withdraw?

[09-May-19 01:21 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Criminal island

[09-May-19 01:22 AM] Alright#0419
it seems to me that their infra itself was owned, not a bunch of individual accounts owned

[09-May-19 01:25 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, @Alright, binance's story on what happened doesnt add up
