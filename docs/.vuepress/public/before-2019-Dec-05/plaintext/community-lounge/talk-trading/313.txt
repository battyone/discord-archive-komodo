it also doesn't help that we breed an increasingly more susceptible populous....

I had a buddy who worked one summer picking tobacco leaves on a farm. The nicotine would go right thru denim. He puked his first day. It would be interesting to see if tobacco pickers developed cancer.

Once ordered a shot of peppermint extract at a bar and told a chick it was vodka, almost got my face damaged @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

She was drunk and just took it to the face immediately without a thought

Needless to say she wasn’t happy :abusedsmily:

@meatspoon my bet would be that it would be a similar ratio of skin cancer to that of mechanics

Testicular cancer among firefighters is huge

[27-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
testicular cancer?

[27-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yup

[27-Nov-18 03:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it's still debatable that whether nicotine  is a carcinogen or not

[27-Nov-18 03:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000  exactly the point I was making

[27-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Did some work for a career firefighter and he said a number of his buddies got it

And i dont think marijuana smokers suffer from cancer as frequently as cigarette smokers. Probably lots of different factors involved.

what is dangerous about smoking is the smoke, it contains lot of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are carcinogens, even if you don't smoke but you inhale the smoke regularly, it will be just a matter of time before you suffer lung cancer

[27-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I for one am not worried about AI or robot overlords creating something like this in the video.  When AI becomes self aware, a cumbersome inefficient humanlike robot will not be the choice.   

We will be fighting drones, nano-bots and satellites with freaking laser beams attached.    
Not terminator style androids.

biggggg volume bump on binance wow

[27-Nov-18 04:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Imagine an AI Pothole filler... who decides humans are the reason potholes keep occurring and therefore decides it is more effective and efficient to wipe out humans than to fix the potholes they create.

[27-Nov-18 04:41 PM] Alecandro#1179
is binance still open for withdrawals and deposits of KMD?

[27-Nov-18 04:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or how about an AI that wants to effectively and efficiently grow corn.   What's to stop them from wiping out humans in their never ending quest for more land to maximize corn yields?

Bit frustrating. According to the announcement, they won't be up until post Dec 15..

That can't be good for price

[27-Nov-18 04:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I guess we will see. Hopefully people don't decide to dump because they have KMD on the exchange.

[27-Nov-18 05:00 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It wouldn't make sense considering the tech upgrade KMD is getting, but you never know

Having 0 withdrawals for 3 weeks could have some affect. I think the jump is indicative of marketing from the announcement

@Alecandro  yes

haha yea I meant I was saying that in the way of, even though wallets are closed for deposits and withdrawals, people can still buy!

[27-Nov-18 05:07 PM] Alecandro#1179
so this is a pretty big technical hard fork eh?

[27-Nov-18 05:10 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, a big one

[27-Nov-18 05:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
can you try to explain to a less technically savvy person what all this fork entails?
