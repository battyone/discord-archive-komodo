Still talking about K64....lol

[08-Sep-19 09:02 PM] joe2x4#5987
I have 24 ARRR in tip bot I'll put up against someone else's ARRR. I'll bet it's not a scam.

[08-Sep-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
Sec let me check my balance; I want to bet moneygrab tho not scam

[08-Sep-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253
I just wanna bet it's gonna be worthless

[08-Sep-19 09:03 PM] Tek#5253

We need an escrow for K64 bets.

[08-Sep-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
I also think arrr is gonna fail

[08-Sep-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
Cuz of the name

[08-Sep-19 09:05 PM] Tek#5253
And the no markets

[08-Sep-19 09:05 PM] allbits#5898
What's wrong with the name?

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
Doesn't sound trustworthy

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] joe2x4#5987
I'm betting that k64 funding is real. If k64 token is money grab, is a different bet.

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
Also sounds like a hobby project

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] allbits#5898
Huh?

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] Tek#5253
Set up by some basement neets

[08-Sep-19 09:06 PM] joe2x4#5987
Scam is very broad definition

K64 is pretty binary either scam or moon, at these prices I am almost tempted to gamble

If you expect a more than 5-10% chance that it’s not a scam, it might be a good gamble to buy a bag and see what gives

[08-Sep-19 09:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I’m a gambling degenerate so more prone to buying these types of things 😃

Big scam you mean

[08-Sep-19 09:15 PM] allbits#5898
Pirate definitely not a scam, though it could fail. It has the highest anon set, but still needs to be bootstrapped into a higher market cap to be actually useful.  Just like bitcoin in the early days - if it gains value, it will be valuable - very chicken and egg. Very all or nothing.  Stacy is irrelevant. Nerds will decide - there's enough of them.

Nerds plus Stacys

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Because it’s a better combo

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I like pirate

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not because of gamble, but just solid

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also bought more of that one ;p

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253
I'll buy a bag at 20 sats

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Has more chances of winning than k64

[08-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For sure

[08-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But upside potential percentagewise might be bigger for k64 though lower odds of that happening for k64 than arrr

[08-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I only hold a few k of them but I play safe so.

[08-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[08-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Cryptoon#3362

K64 started well but it’s on his way to a cliff tbh

[08-Sep-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253
K64 smells like moneygrab fail scam

[08-Sep-19 09:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Crypto in its form is a gamble. If you can not gamble, go away. This is not made for weak people. My biggest winnings come from my biggest gambles.

[08-Sep-19 09:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But if you can make educated gambles even better

[08-Sep-19 09:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to the pair mentioned above... one project continually shares project growth and releases info and integration use cases, as well as constantly communicating on behalf of its users and not “to” them.   The other continually shares ideas but not its growth or releases and it communicates “to” stakeholders, not on behalf of them. 
I guess it depends which type of project you like better.   Two different mindsets.   Trusted vs. trustless.

[08-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah arrr for sure an educated gamble/investment

[08-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Geert#4612
Theres no good or bad gamble. If it's educated or safe, it's not a gamble. I saw stories in the past where FUD used as a method to lower prices. At the target they buy the coin low and sell it high.

[08-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
More the kmd way of doing things, not just promising things but keep working and delivering

[08-Sep-19 09:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
