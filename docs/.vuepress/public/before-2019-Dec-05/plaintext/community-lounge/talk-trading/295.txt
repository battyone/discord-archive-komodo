I guess the winning move on 'all time highs' is to cash out and come back in a year or two

Tbh, if you look back at it

central banks poured what, 10.000 billion into the economy?

[20-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Imagine if every household got a piece of that instead of the banks

[20-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
would have supported the economy a lot more tbh

[20-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
real economy that is, and not just the S&P500

`Imagine if every household got a piece of that instead of the banks`
The problem with that is that 90% of banks working capital is vapor; so, a "piece" of nothing is still nothing

[20-Nov-18 03:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
Yeah, you cant stimulate an economy by printing money out of thin air and giving it to people. If that worked, governments would be doing it.

[20-Nov-18 03:54 PM] blubbi#0643
@meatspoon isn' t that what the government actually do !?

[20-Nov-18 03:54 PM] meatspoon#7860
Well, i guess they already are doing it. Just giving it to their crony friends at zirp

[20-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you dont know if it works, we do know that the money that was poured into 'the economy' to the banks didnt really support the real economy

[20-Nov-18 03:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
Of course i know it doesnt work. Think about it for a minute.   The currency would just be devalued at the expense of more debt.

[20-Nov-18 03:56 PM] meatspoon#7860
Inflation goes up as people spend their helicopter money. The cost is kicked down the road in the form of debt. And we are one step closer to financial Armageddon.

[20-Nov-18 03:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Venezuela is effectively doing just this.

[20-Nov-18 03:57 PM] meatspoon#7860
Is it working for them?

@meatspoon but that is exactly what happened, only this time the banks got the money, and not the people

[20-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
they printed 10.000 billion out of thin air with the stroke of a pen on the balance sheet of some central bank

[20-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Everyone got effectively a lot poorer during the financial crisis and the 'saving' of banks

[20-Nov-18 04:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But regular people dont even know/realise this

[20-Nov-18 04:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
Right.  I suppose I agree that printing money and giving it directly to the people would be less bad than giving money directly to bankster oligarchs... but neither is going to solve any of the fundamental problems of our banking/monetary system.

[20-Nov-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
and both actions will further accelerate us into the inevitable collapse

[20-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
at least if you give it to the people nothing sticks to the hands of the banksters üòÉ

[20-Nov-18 04:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is the better of two bad options

[20-Nov-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
i disagree with that.  as long as they control the system, they benefit

[20-Nov-18 04:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
if half the people who receive the money put it in the bank, the banksters get to loan out 10X that amount and create more debt serfs

[20-Nov-18 04:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
so you would still be pumping fake money into a rigged system

[20-Nov-18 04:14 PM] blubbi#0643
the whole Crypto Industrie got a capital of 160 billion , only the EZB printing 60 billion every month, think abou that ! üòÑ

[20-Nov-18 04:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
but i agree with the "better of two bad options."  but the other thing that sucks about helicopter money is the idea of feeding this growing sense of entitlement of the Free Shit Army.  More and more people these days think they are entitled to everything.... health care, transport, smart phones, etc.  As a society, we have to be very careful about feeding this mentality

btw I agree @meatspoon dont get me wrong. But I think the main problem is that the entitled people dont realize where the 'free' stuff is coming from.
