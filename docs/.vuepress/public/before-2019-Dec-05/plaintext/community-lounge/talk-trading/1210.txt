if KMD is at 1000$, ETH should be at 100k and BTC at 10M ? what a bubble compared to world PIB

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
500$ (1000x from low) would mean only 50bn mcap?

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is still way lower than eth at previous peak

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] phm87#7395
marketcap doesn't exist: many coins are lost or won't be sold

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd pulling 1000x doesnt mean everything has to move linearly

[14-Nov-19 10:30 PM] phm87#7395
(except if you own half of marketcap and you do OTC to take the bitcoins of an investor)

[14-Nov-19 10:31 PM] Neko#5830
I think komodo will repeat what vechain is doing  for now because of china

[14-Nov-19 10:31 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah but that's insane I think

[14-Nov-19 10:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sure

[14-Nov-19 10:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But still, jl said the goal for the complete ecosystem is 1-10% of total mcap

[14-Nov-19 10:31 PM] jspook16#3059
Emwhen eth did it it can up from under .03 cents not 50

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd arrr and vrsc could easily be 1-5%

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
I have a notary node, it is printing KMD, should I sell or buy ? (I bought at 10500 sat and at 9500 sat before it felt below)

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Do you need fiat?

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
no

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Then hodl

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] jspook16#3059
Well you are getting below ico

[14-Nov-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
yes but during months, price was decreasing

[14-Nov-19 10:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What if now it goes up for months

[14-Nov-19 10:36 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah but not 1000x. That would be unsafe really. I could see kmd getting to 50 USD steaditly over 12 months

[14-Nov-19 10:36 PM] jspook16#3059
Steady growth

[14-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
50 seems fair

[14-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
5$ ARRR

[14-Nov-19 10:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
:p

[14-Nov-19 10:38 PM] jorian#4555
You‚Äôre nuts

[14-Nov-19 10:39 PM] jspook16#3059
For arrr I see a solid 1 USD. It's anonymous and I can see it pegged to 1 USD as a means to make funds anonymous

[14-Nov-19 10:40 PM] SHossain#0007
if XMR is about $100, ARRR should at least be $50 realistically

[14-Nov-19 10:40 PM] Neko#5830
I don't see impossible 1000x from here but it will take like 5 or 6 years, will depend alot of the ecosystem

[14-Nov-19 10:47 PM] jspook16#3059
I'm thinking short term. 12 months

[14-Nov-19 10:48 PM] jspook16#3059
That's about what it took eth to get to 1k. But that included a btc bull run

[14-Nov-19 10:50 PM] joe2x4#5987
If BTC moons at ~$60-80k, then $85.20 kmd.

[14-Nov-19 10:51 PM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe even .21

[14-Nov-19 10:52 PM] jspook16#3059
Do you see btc mooning that far? I'm thinking btc would 'moon' back to 20k at some point but probably not more than that

[14-Nov-19 10:52 PM] joe2x4#5987
60-80k by end of 2020

[14-Nov-19 10:53 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy

[14-Nov-19 10:54 PM] joe2x4#5987
```P.S. I think Bitcoin will bottom on the current correction $7 to $9k within this month or next. Then start moving up again. Possibly might not exceed $13k again until start of 2020. I am expecting a rocket shot to $50k starting roughly February.```

An easy going crypto wallet that gives you the power.

[15-Nov-19 01:09 AM] kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275
given how hard it can be to do it through biggest exchanges and the potential price drop when deposits are re-opened seems like a fast nice way

[15-Nov-19 03:06 AM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
So is Atomicwalllet using same tech as atomicdex?

[15-Nov-19 03:22 AM] PTYX#6840
@BoBot-BUY KMD not yet but it seems they will implement it soon

[15-Nov-19 03:23 AM] richardt#2807
Are they going to use KMD tech?

[15-Nov-19 04:12 AM] tolken#2655
@PTYX did they/do they have their own atomic swap tech? Or just a feature they hadn‚Äôt implemented in their wallet?  Or as richardt so succinctly stated, did you hear somewhere their intent to use KMD tech?

[15-Nov-19 04:13 AM] PTYX#6840
they always said they had atomicswaps but i never saw any evidence of it. they also admit to use changelly and other api based exchanges

[15-Nov-19 04:13 AM] PTYX#6840
I thought I saw on a twitter post that they will be switchint to non-custodial and since they have been working with the kmd team, it only makes sense that they add atomicdex tech to actually offer dex services

[15-Nov-19 09:00 AM] costa2439#3771
But would we be talking about the DEX "asset" marketmaker? Or would they create their own marketmaker?

[15-Nov-19 09:08 AM] gcharang#6833
if they want to take advantage of the existing and future liquidity that will come to atomicDEX, they have to use the same marketmeker we are using

[15-Nov-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
people adding their own margins to the mm2 trade is definitely possible and actually quite expected

[15-Nov-19 09:49 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, they can add extra margins but the dex fee should go to the same address as it is in our atomicDEX mobile for participating in the same network, correct?

[15-Nov-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes the taker dex fee is the same, built into the protocol

[15-Nov-19 09:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd continuing to paint nice support at 10k

[15-Nov-19 09:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[15-Nov-19 01:12 PM] richardt#2807
So it's not confirmed yet that Atomic wallet will be using KMD tech, but there's a good chance? Is that what I'm hearing?

[15-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
atomic wallet doesnt really plan on having atomic swap capabilities any time soon because unable to implement themselves

[15-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
name is misleading

[15-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it was once on their roadmap but not anymore

[15-Nov-19 01:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Now that they heard of atomicDEX from KOMODO, they might want to implement that instead in their wallet üôÇ

[15-Nov-19 01:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Which would/should expand mm2.0 userbase significantly

[15-Nov-19 01:16 PM] richardt#2807
Yeah that's what I mean. It would be great if true. They have alot of users

@ggmesh @KomodoPlatform Hey! We had atomic swaps for BTC-LTC in the previous Atomic version. However removed them in v2 due to low users demand, liquidity issues and complicated implementation for the rest of blockchains. Most likely will get back to swaps next year or add...

I think if KMD could get to $2 by end of this year or early next year, that would be a very bullish sign for the rest of 2020.  Last time at $2 was June 2018

Hey, I‚Äôve been out of the loop recently, is there a more user friendly DEX available these days?

[16-Nov-19 09:05 AM] Kay Gee#2313
I want to trade BTC for KMD and, considering I buy KMD because of the decentralization, I figure now‚Äôs as good a time as any to try avoid a CEX
