Using the same chain, for too long would just make it impractical to use... It would gget huge and finding the files in the chain would get slow.

[31-Dec-18 06:28 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe each poster could be a chain

[31-Dec-18 06:28 AM] jspook16#3059
Oh

[31-Dec-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was the idea yea... problem is hsoting all those chains

[31-Dec-18 06:29 AM] jspook16#3059
Ok I see the problem

[31-Dec-18 06:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like it can be used for some cool stuff, but I;m not sure I can really make a platform out of it or anything. Definatly make a GUI that ppl can use top stream with though. if people find a use for it they can. We were thinkign on LABS to make a chain where we backup bootstraps into of chains that have ended.

[31-Dec-18 06:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its an ondemand chain, so it only mines when you send files. The file needs to be stramed into the mining node aswell, the txs dont really propagate though the mempool, I think they are too fast....

[31-Dec-18 06:32 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe you're right though. Each file is a chain. But maybe the viewer mines it when wanting to view that file

[31-Dec-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No, the streamer mines the chain when they stream, and to veiw it you sync the chain, and issue an RPC call that pulls all the data in a block. 
The idea was for live video your GUI connects to the daemon, with -blocknotify and the data is automatically extracted and pushed to the app when a block arrives.

[31-Dec-18 06:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that would feed into a video buffer

[31-Dec-18 06:35 AM] jspook16#3059
I see. Either way you got streaming to work. I saw your GitHub post a few days ago. Could lead to some other ideas

[31-Dec-18 06:37 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe not a YouTube type structure but more of a FB live structure

[31-Dec-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah the base of it is done, liek the algo that is needed, its very very fast. Did it all in C... Some of those loops and stuff I had to write are crazy, I'm not even sure how they work, but they do. üòÇ

[31-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for a couple of weeks work, without knowing like any C code it turned out pretty good.

[31-Dec-18 06:44 AM] jspook16#3059
Props man. If I ever get some more free time I will give it a go

[31-Dec-18 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... I cant say when I will get back to it, hope its not too long. It was pretty fun.

[31-Dec-18 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not 100% sure there is a working komodod fork where it actally works atm, but I have all the code on git.

this voodoo was really interesting this time last year, in retrospect it's even more interesting;

@Likewise we hit target 1 yesterday, the most obvious place to pause... similar story in other alts, pausing at key levels but still looking bullish. Up from here is the real breakout, especially on the KMDUSD chart. Next targets are 28000 (which should be less of an issue now IMO) and 33000. But the real targets for this run medium term are around 60k. To me this is conservative, for crypto, and part of me wants to project further for some serious fomo but that may require some strong catalysts to bring in new waves of of speculators, or whatever whales have taken the large positions in the last 5 months to just pump through obvious levels and freak out any sellers into buying back etc - less likely but could always happen, especially if bitcoin has actually found or has nearly found it's low.

Did anyone think it was happening on the 31st?

[01-Jan-19 01:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dropping due to BTC taking a dump

[01-Jan-19 01:01 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Plus if that were the case, you would not be trying to pump it 15% on the day of the "rebrand". Most would sell on the news and pumping it like waves 3x in 2 weeks

[01-Jan-19 01:01 AM] crumb#2550
for some reason there actually were people who bought with the expectation of some grand revealing of rebranded Komodo

[01-Jan-19 01:01 AM] crumb#2550
contrary to many people saying this is not something one should expect

[01-Jan-19 01:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol.... most of whom can only afford $100 to invest so it matters not so much

[01-Jan-19 01:02 AM] crumb#2550
but some site had that info. so ...

[01-Jan-19 01:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I can only say if you are investing on the day of the news thinking it will pump, it usually dumps

[01-Jan-19 01:02 AM] crumb#2550
there are always people who do not understand what is actually happening

[01-Jan-19 01:03 AM] crumb#2550
even if they are told multiple times

[01-Jan-19 01:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It's fine they will learn the hard way

It was the whale that created most of the excitement. It's going down like it always did before, we just don't have the whale around to prop it back up.

[01-Jan-19 01:53 AM] Likewise#6767
A healthy retrace is good for the trend.

[01-Jan-19 02:10 AM] Likewise#6767
That is IF it is a trend

[01-Jan-19 02:33 AM] ver_User#6608
trend change is happening IMO, key levels will still get sold, KMD is just a chop fest of a market so... looks worse cos not enough liquidity to avoid horrible spikes. 

if we find BTC lows and rebound, at least medium term, alts will break those key levels and it will confirm the alt season... first off we need to shake out all the fools buying the local tops and consolidate

[01-Jan-19 02:35 AM] ver_User#6608
it does look pretty ugly though

[01-Jan-19 02:36 AM] ver_User#6608
