BTC - Trading using OBV for BITSTAMP:BTCUSD by filbfilb

i just see a lot of colored lines. after the fact you can always tell it was the top or bottom. the hard part is to know before much time is passed

[17-Apr-19 03:59 PM] Markus#5464
realised line means if price is above majority of ppl trade in a profit

[17-Apr-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the OBJ chart is very useful

[17-Apr-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is still in negative territory (barely)

[17-Apr-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but as long as it keeps going up, it seems we are out of the bear

[17-Apr-19 04:01 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Except for IOTA. Coin been stuck around that 30 cent mark for over six months now.

that really did turn before the peak! it is a very good indicator, lets not forget this next bull cycle

[17-Apr-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
though the two earlier times it went down could have faked you out, so average out as long as it looks like the OBV is on a downslope

[17-Apr-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and start averaging back in when it goes on an upslope

[17-Apr-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that should capture a fair amount of the max possible profit, without much risk

[17-Apr-19 04:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
yea might not be a bad idea! just another tool man

I protected the identity of Satoshi. It's time, though, that this be put to bed. Imposters claim to be him, we are spending time and energy in search of him - It's a waste. Every day I will narrow down the identity of Satoshi until he reveals himself, or I reveal him.
