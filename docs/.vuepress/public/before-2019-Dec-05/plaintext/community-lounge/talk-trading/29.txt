KMD has a firm iron grip on place #60 Coinmarketcap !

[27-Jun-18 05:25 PM] RAE#3178
Been watching Ark and Ardor slip away down the list.

[27-Jun-18 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not sure what a better system would be, but I'm so over cmc "rankings"

[27-Jun-18 05:26 PM] RAE#3178
Agreed, I can't see a better metric than market cap descending order yet.

[27-Jun-18 05:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
virtually every metric is better than market cap üò£

[27-Jun-18 05:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
When 1 KMD can be exchanged for one thousand United States dollars and all parties can walk away from said exchange comfortable with what transpired

[27-Jun-18 05:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs my metric

[27-Jun-18 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
for most coins/tokens, market cap is faker than Mayra Hills' titties

[27-Jun-18 05:31 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôm an ass man so I cannot understand this example

Classic Aussie movie.

No other metric is useful because no other coin has any kind of useful figures for other metrics

[27-Jun-18 05:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just kidding, that was me on the way to a job interview

[27-Jun-18 05:41 PM] RAE#3178
If you were driving the Interceptor then that is okay

[27-Jun-18 05:41 PM] Jazzy#0001
Maybe you could use volume, which is inconsistent, or number of on chain tx, which means there are only like 3 blockchains worth discussing

[27-Jun-18 05:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
‚ÄúNo way they can say no now‚Äù

"No other metric is useful because no other coin has any kind of useful figures for other metrics"
When the market cap of CoinX drops because CoinY market dropped and CoinX market hasn't even had a chance to respond, then CoinX market cap is meaningless #BTCmakesFakeCapsForMostCoins

[27-Jun-18 05:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Depth of market buys across exchanges

[27-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
ShitcoinXYZ can inflate supply and make token sale on shitcointradez.ru and claim multi billion market cap

[27-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Jazzy#0001
You're right, almost all market caps are useless because bitcoin makes them drastically overvalued

[27-Jun-18 05:46 PM] Jazzy#0001
I think you've cut straight to the point, we don't even need to bother talking about almost all altcoins üôÇ

Coins of businesses are a different story

See what they can do

[27-Jun-18 05:47 PM] Jazzy#0001
I'm not sure I agree, for the most part they're all still irrelevant

[27-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Jazzy#0001
Outside of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple ü§¢ everything feels way to niche to even measure

[27-Jun-18 05:49 PM] Jazzy#0001
And even then it's not like Ripple is close to the other two

[27-Jun-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
EOS rules them all

[27-Jun-18 05:55 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Interesting situation today - there was "attack" to go sub 6k $ for BTC but it end up rebouncing above last prev hours avg... maybe time to go up? @siu - Chainmakers

EOS is probably the ruler of all shitcoins

[27-Jun-18 06:00 PM] Jazzy#0001
Personally I'm moving funds to make another buy in tomorrow

[27-Jun-18 06:00 PM] Jazzy#0001
But that's mostly regularly scheduled cost averaging, not overly based on the price action

[27-Jun-18 06:28 PM] RAE#3178
Could a new crypto metric combine:-
- Max coin supply  /  24hr volume  +  electrical input kw/h  =  value

[27-Jun-18 06:30 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
circulated supply needs to fit in there somewhere

[27-Jun-18 06:31 PM] RAE#3178
Swapout Max supply for circulating supply

[27-Jun-18 06:32 PM] RAE#3178
We could call it the 'Nakamoto' market value metric

[27-Jun-18 06:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
(circulating supply*100)/max

[27-Jun-18 06:35 PM] RAE#3178
Everything gets measured in Sats and Naks üòÄ 
I'm no mathematician so prob not a good idea...but erhaps jl777 or some other smart Komodo community member could muse over the idea and see if it'd work.

[27-Jun-18 06:37 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, if you're going to look at volume, you need to take into account the current percentage of the total ever.
500BTC daily holds a different meaning if 10% is circulation than if 90% is

[27-Jun-18 06:38 PM] RAE#3178

sorry, coulnd't stop myself...

[27-Jun-18 06:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
genieisms only get applied when someone *should* know better üòõ

[27-Jun-18 07:00 PM] Jazzy#0001
That calculation would inherently value PoS currencies less than PoW currencies

[27-Jun-18 07:00 PM] Jazzy#0001
And is also nearly impossible to accurately measure

[27-Jun-18 07:00 PM] Jazzy#0001
The bigger issue is, what value do any merged metrics like that ultimately provide?

[27-Jun-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"That calculation would inherently value PoS currencies less than PoW currencies"
That would likely depend on the coin, the reward, and the frequency of rewards

[27-Jun-18 07:03 PM] Jazzy#0001
'+  electrical input kw/h' is the important part for that

[27-Jun-18 07:03 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"what value do any merged metrics like that ultimately provide?"
do you not use "merged metrics" in determining that HomeA has more value to you than HomeB?

[27-Jun-18 07:04 PM] Jazzy#0001
Only if you can quantify why those metrics have value, you don't just throw them all in a basket at say 'HomeA is worth X because the computer says so'

[27-Jun-18 07:05 PM] Jazzy#0001
Are you masquerading as a faux-intellectual or are you just needlessly contrarian?

[27-Jun-18 07:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"you don't just throw them all in a basket at say 'HomeA is worth X because the computer says so'"

"Are you masquerading as a faux-intellectual or are you just needlessly contrarian?"
OK, you caught me, I'm a complete idiot who knows nothing, hates Bitcoin, and only thinks market cap is bad because it favors Bitcoin üôÑ

[27-Jun-18 07:08 PM] Jazzy#0001
Here you go again throwing out needless strawmen instead of actually thinking about the point in that statement

[27-Jun-18 07:09 PM] Jazzy#0001
I don't get it, are you actually trying to hold a productive conversation or not? Because it seems like you aren't

[27-Jun-18 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and the "point" of your ad hom would be....

[27-Jun-18 07:10 PM] Jazzy#0001
When I ask "what value do any merged metrics like that ultimately provide?" and your rebuke is 'do you not use "merged metrics" in determining that HomeA has more value to you than HomeB?"' you're not thinking about the point

[27-Jun-18 07:10 PM] Jazzy#0001
You're throwing out unrelated comparisons to an irrelevant status quo instead of actually justifying why a metric might have value

[27-Jun-18 07:10 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
P.S. there's a hilarious irony that you call my reply to your false-dilemmic ad hom "strawman" üòÇ ü§£

[27-Jun-18 07:11 PM] Jazzy#0001
So either you don't understand the points I'm trying to illustrate, or you're just choosing to ignore them

[27-Jun-18 07:11 PM] Jazzy#0001
If it's the first I can try to work on explaining them better from now on, but I feel like they're pretty clear and our discussions follow this path on such a regular basis I can't help feel like it's the latter

[27-Jun-18 07:13 PM] Jazzy#0001
I mean we're having it in two different channels right now

[27-Jun-18 07:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe stop saying dumb shit in 2 channels at once and I'll stop telling you in 2 channels that it's dumb shit?

[27-Jun-18 07:15 PM] Jazzy#0001
That's exactly how I feel about you

[27-Jun-18 07:15 PM] Jazzy#0001
Maybe we're just utterly unable to reconcile our points of view

[27-Jun-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
sorry for you that you're in your feels

[27-Jun-18 07:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe when you get out of them, we can have a rational conversation

[27-Jun-18 07:16 PM] Jazzy#0001
This was a conversation about the value in objective measurements for the valuations of blockchains

[27-Jun-18 07:16 PM] Jazzy#0001
Nothing in it is slightly related to feels

[27-Jun-18 07:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"That's exactly how I feel about you"...."Nothing in it is slightly related to feels"
Those comments are in direct conflict; however, I'm not sure what I should expect from someone randomly chucking out "strawmen" after chucking out a false-dilemmic ad hom

[27-Jun-18 07:20 PM] Jazzy#0001
Our meta discussion about your inability to hold a rational discussion and the underlying discussion about metric valuation are different things.

[27-Jun-18 07:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
