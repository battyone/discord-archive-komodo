[15-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
Yeah Hush below 200 sats is surreal, but right next to it we have ARRR @ 500 sats again, below my initial entry, blood is in the streets especially in KMD ecosystem

[15-Aug-19 08:29 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
without mentioning the arb opportunities in KMD pairs too, tis a profitable time if you know what you're doing, and I can't say I know all that much

[15-Aug-19 08:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
kmd has already survived much worse than this. It's staying power is underestimated

[15-Aug-19 08:36 PM] JimD#9272
whats KMDs market cap if we take into account the value of all the chains on the ecosystem ?

[15-Aug-19 08:40 PM] Markus#5464
why would u wanna do that anyway

[15-Aug-19 08:40 PM] Markus#5464
if we think same with Eth then probably market cap of Eth is like 50%

[15-Aug-19 08:55 PM] JimD#9272
Its just a thought experiment

[15-Aug-19 08:55 PM] JimD#9272
great question for Eth too

@Cryptoon so given the chart, we should see a recession in ~2 years..

[15-Aug-19 10:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus the team is not, but i am considering it. We need to get through to our market and unfortunately for the most part, tech is not something they care about right now.

Now i am not saying that we need a model, we need someone that is smart and can talk about the tech. If their outward facing attributes help to convey that, not too sure why we should not use that to our advantage. Considering the demographic of crypto users, if i got a man to do it, it probably wont have the same effect.

@Deleted User hiring a lady to talk about Komodo tech

[15-Aug-19 10:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He said that it is too shallow, something that dash does.

[15-Aug-19 10:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
LOL had to look that up, no they will need to prove they can talk about the tech in a concise way

[15-Aug-19 10:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Marketing is forming a strategy to get your message across to your potential users, rightly or wrongly, in this case, that is the best way to get through to them.

@Hollowman9000 are they still acting like they got 78m or have they just stopped talking about it?

[16-Aug-19 01:05 AM] AkiraX#8269
K64?

[16-Aug-19 01:14 AM] yorklab#7270
@allbits  They stopped talking about it. They say from this point on nothing will be talked about until it's officially announced.

[16-Aug-19 10:41 AM] phideas#8309
imo only thing that can save k64 is to disclose the funding with a proof. they had a chance to do that in ama and they failed.
the longer they delay this, the longer they will look like scammers in worst case or a bad joke in best case.
even if some miracle happens (it won't) and the funding turns out to be true, they reputation is already toast. 
never invested in k64 just sharing my personal view. easy funding days are over.

[16-Aug-19 10:59 AM] phideas#8309
i feel sorry for everyone who are swapping their kmd for k64. i am gonna ask one simple question, pls explain.
if they got such a big funding, why the fuck you still throwing money towards them? i mean, come on... 
you should value kmd in first place if you want to ever see this platform to succeed.

[16-Aug-19 11:00 AM] phideas#8309
end of rant üôÇ do what you want, it is your money.

[16-Aug-19 11:12 AM] dan.#2473
It likely didn't start a scam, but now they're backed into a corner . They would of been best off saying "we messed up, so sorry, no 78m"

[16-Aug-19 11:13 AM] dan.#2473
_nobody_ with half a brain is investing 78m in what I've seen, no offense to k64 but it makes 0 sense and doesn't happen

[16-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
it was just a scam to steal your kmd

[16-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
a very legit looking scam

[16-Aug-19 11:16 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this will go down in history as the most ridicolous self inflicted blunder on part Komodo, mark my words

[16-Aug-19 11:17 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
"Komodo, bringing not-shilling-our-tech to a whole new level! We even call them scammers"

[16-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Neko#5830
78m is a lot of dosh

[16-Aug-19 11:56 AM] washparkdlt#6482
If anyone wants to give the tldr on k64...

[16-Aug-19 12:03 PM] crumb#2550
team said they got funding, but there has not been a confirmation.

[16-Aug-19 12:04 PM] crumb#2550
so we're in a limbo, until the funder announces it officially (or doesn't)

[16-Aug-19 12:04 PM] crumb#2550
tread carefully

[16-Aug-19 12:06 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
tl:dr  

K64: made many poor communications, too big claims that so far couldn't be officially confirmed

Komodo team: lost patience too early and jumped to conclusions that's a scam

Me: shaking my head because I know K64 is right

[16-Aug-19 12:12 PM] yorklab#7270
It's hard to believe the GS story but  If k64 gets any amount of money from anybody, I consider that to be good news because this means they can continue developing software. I am hoping that k64 can be a success because that would really help the Komodo ecosystem.

[16-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Caglio#3337
and tell there is nothing true about the claims

and then twilight punkster saying we need another month

[16-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Caglio#3337
"everything will be revealed in next month"

[16-Aug-19 12:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@KomodoWorld  dont think the team said it was a scam, it is just making sure what they said is true, is true.

[16-Aug-19 12:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They have promised a lot and delivered very little. Lots of big aspirations and flashy marketing with very poor leadership and little in the way of showing any achievements. They have shown a lack of understanding or willingness to actually incorporate a smart chain into their games, stating they'll build the game first and then add in the blockchain stuff later. They have also claimed they received a 78million investment from Goldman sachs along with claiming they are investing 5mill into rfox, which both. claims currently have no evidence or proof they are true.

More info:
Early on in the piece, they said they were working directly with jl777 on NFT/Crypto condition code for their SDK and games. They also publically dismissed/ridiculed one of the KMD devs (blackjok3r) when he started asking questions(who was actually eager to help this project), finding holes in their development claims and breakthroughs.
They(with the help of a KMD service provider, who they promised to reimburse with funds, flight to the Netherlands and promotion after helping) created a smart chain that has no crypto condition support and that they received 100% of the 64million coins(mining reward is 0.0001K64).
A member of their team "fat fingered" a large sell order on DP early in the piece (not sure of the amount or total KMD they received).
They have promised announcements or releases of information and continously delay the release of any substantial information.
The KMD team have publically stated their opinions on the project. Just look in the archived channels in discord.

Ill admit, after a few promised announcements and publically berating blackjok3r, I've stopped following them as much, so please correct me if I misspoke. Feel free to make your own mind up and dyor, but I'll be gladly corrected if this project is legit and goes on to do great things. I want to see the KMD ecosystem thrive; this project was questionable from day one.

[16-Aug-19 12:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't deny there were mistakes on part of K64 and from Komodo point of view it makes sense to be cautious. I do think some team members went a little too far in their words. I'm comforting knowing it will be over soon and both will collaborate again on great things

[16-Aug-19 12:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
a thing we can agree upon : dyor

[16-Aug-19 12:24 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also I forgot to mention their UltraFighter beta testing program. They claimed to need 100's of beta testers asap, but when push came to shove a week or two later, the gave was "playable" for roughly 2s before it either crashed or couldnt do anything else. Even before that, I asked how we could verify there was no malicious code, and I was nearly laughed out of there. In the end, people (not me) downloaded their binaries with no awareness of what was in there.

[16-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I think there is also another thing we can agree on

[16-Aug-19 12:25 PM] Markus#5464
Hearing k64 team member sold coins on a exchange and ‚Äùfatfingered‚Äù will never make me invest a single $ into such project
