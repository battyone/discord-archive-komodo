I'm expecting a swing batta batta

[10-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
@meatspoon best tech ever ðŸ˜„

[10-Aug-19 02:37 PM] Caglio#3337
@dan. you are right, I should do that

[10-Aug-19 02:38 PM] dan.#2473
Just be careful at these levels and that RSI

[10-Aug-19 02:39 PM] dan.#2473
Don't panic either if you do it

[10-Aug-19 02:39 PM] dan.#2473
It's going to do some tricky things on the way down

[10-Aug-19 02:40 PM] dan.#2473
It's almost a hedge vs a falling price to do this

[10-Aug-19 02:40 PM] dan.#2473
But also I'm completely talking out of my ass likely so on the other hand  don't listen to me

[10-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Well yeah, I dont think I will sell anyway

[10-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Even tho I am sure its gonna fall down

[10-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
I have that degenerate gambling problem

[10-Aug-19 02:42 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats why I decided only to buy, and sell at one point

[10-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Caglio#3337
It feeds my addiction to check the price all the time, which is honestly bothering me ðŸ˜„

[10-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
if it makes you feel better my average buy were exactly at 15k sats

[10-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so ðŸ˜ƒ

[10-Aug-19 02:46 PM] Buddz1993#5380
at least according to my portfolio status.

[10-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Kmd is a solid project we all know that it just didn't have the recognition it deserves ...

[10-Aug-19 02:47 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Yet.

[10-Aug-19 02:48 PM] Buddz1993#5380
cmon compare it to all the coins in top 20 what makes them better than KMD? , besides marketing we all know that ðŸ˜ƒ

[10-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
its actually not marketing

[10-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD marketing is actually pretty good compared to most project

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what people confuse is market price with marketing

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
market price is set by the marketmakers and there is an entire industry of marketmakers that take it literally

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Caglio#3337
KMD marketing is pretty good compared to what ?

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well , its  the way you advertise your product also

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
probably started in china, where they misunderstood what it meant

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you guys are wrong

[10-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
let me explain

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
usually market making means making a market with bid and ask at all times for something

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
provide liquidity in both directions, but not really affecting the price, more just responding to price

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] Buddz1993#5380
enlighten me

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
well, in china, they have "marketmakers" that interpreted it literally

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
as in making the entire market

[10-Aug-19 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
If y'all could stop selling, that would be great

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
they intentionally paint chart patterns that fit into the TA model

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
even wonder how brand new projects you never heard of, doesnt really have a product, yet is trading a huge market cap?

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I'm still holding strong tbh , don't intend to sell anytime soon

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not the marketing, but rather the marketmaking

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so our marketmaking is weak

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] Buddz1993#5380
compared to others?

[10-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
they charge giant percentages of coins

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so for 10% of your coin supply, a few hundred BTC of working capital, they will paint the charts to get the TA people all excited

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and people fall for that

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
easly

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
of course they do, since TA works most of the time and this is the reason

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
it has a very strong helping hand

[10-Aug-19 02:53 PM] Buddz1993#5380
just because some random dude is saying the coin will go down or up or sideways

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and if it doesn't

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
who do you blame?

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the market

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] Buddz1993#5380
or the person?

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and these marketmakers take no risk as they get the coins to sell on spec, and working capital to buy

[10-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you think there is so much fake volume? it is to drown out the real volumes and to be able to paint the desired chart patterns

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
Orderbook manipulation is too easy. Selling $1 of a coin at any price changes the ticker to that price, even if there is 0 volume possible at that price. The "price" of a coin is horrible fuzzy math

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
But then all the altcoins are shit

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
They just use them to obtain more bitcoin

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] Caglio#3337
Why would anyone want to hold an altcoin that is so manipulative ever ?

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
in the BTC dominance mania, even the marketmakers have to wait

[10-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
so dont blame our marketing, blame us for not hiring these marketmaking outfits

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
so you are saying

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
90% of the top 20 coins did that?

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Rofl, marketing team is shitty

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats totally out of the point here

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I mean I don't believe all the top coins did that tbh

[10-Aug-19 02:56 PM] Caglio#3337
Guys made a webpage in year and a half, cmon

[10-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Caglio#3337
Also doesnt help that a lot of projects involved in this ecosystem are bs

[10-Aug-19 02:57 PM] Caglio#3337
but we need them, to grow right

[10-Aug-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean these brand new coins out of nowhere

[10-Aug-19 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
not all coins do it, but many of the ICO ones are desparate and do such things

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Caglio#3337
But on the other hand, that would mean while we attained top 50 position

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Caglio#3337
lets not look at top 5-10 coins

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
@Caglio you dont take more than a few seconds to actually read the marketing materials, therefore you dont seem qualified to comment on its effectiveness or not

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Caglio#3337
but other 40 infront of us

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
what i hear is that we have very good documentation and it all fits together

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
which is not an easy thing to do with all the tech pieces that we have

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Caglio#3337
if 20 of them did that, that would mean komodo is like one of the best selling coins

[10-Aug-19 02:58 PM] Caglio#3337
while in reality noone gives a fuck about it, or even heard about it

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i would estimate 20 coins above KMD did indeed hire the market makers

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Itâ€™s more focused on devs than common people with no tech skills

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
And if we are really arguing about good marketing, than this is pointless

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Buddz1993#5380
That I have to agree

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
If this is a good marketing, we will never be nothing

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
but as soon as they stop paying the monthly retainer, well the market makers stop their "work"

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] Caglio#3337
Sell now, gg

[10-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
of course there is no guarantee of any high price that is sustained

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I mean Iâ€™m obviously a believe and will be for the remaining weeks/months / years to come

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
People are starting to be in despair

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, the reality of the crypto world is that the "media" is 90% pay for placement

[10-Aug-19 03:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Blaming everything and everyone

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the marketcap is TA charts painted by fake volumes by hired market makers

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
Well then everyone should dump crypto, and the whole idea of money that wont be controlled by banks

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Caglio#3337
it will be controlled by crypto exchanges that are same shit

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so i dont worry as i know these 20+ above us that are being propped up artificially cant do it forever

[10-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
and eventually BTC dominance will go below 50% again

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
we just keep solving previously unsolved tech problems

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
last week with the help of zawy, i implemented what I believe is the best DAA

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
So why were we in top 40 a few months ago and now we are back down to top 70 atm?, and obviously itâ€™s because people sold more than they bought that I know , but do you have anything that you think that triggered this to happen ?

[10-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
in 3 blocks, it will stop a 10000x hashrate attack and slow things down to normal block speed

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Thatâ€™s progress

[10-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
a 20% gain from here and we are back to top 50
