certainly if there was such volume, the price would have to keep going up as there isnt enough inventory available at lower prices

[16-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Likewise#6767
not saying that

[16-Feb-19 08:47 PM] Likewise#6767
but drastic changes in volume is not the sign of healthy market coditions

[16-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Likewise#6767
nor the sign of a sustained trend

[16-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly there are the green candle hoppers who pile into whatever is on top of CMC, just because it is

[16-Feb-19 08:48 PM] Likewise#6767
yes they add to volume

[16-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just because that happened,doesnt mean that the long term bear trend wasnt also broken

[16-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and if the long term bear is broken, it seems we are entering start of new bull

[16-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
not saying there is confirmation either way, yet

[16-Feb-19 08:50 PM] Likewise#6767
indeed

[16-Feb-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if anything the odds that we did find the bottom and turned is incrementally higher after the recent week

[16-Feb-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but certainly it needs further confirmations and price can always break down below 20k, but as long as 20k holds, that is a new behavior

[16-Feb-19 08:51 PM] Likewise#6767
if and when BTC makes another drop, which I think it will anyday now, KMD should follow lower too IMO

[16-Feb-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so lets see the price when the volume drops to 35btc on binance

[16-Feb-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC is the wild card in all this, of course

[16-Feb-19 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
cant have a KMD bull run with BTC still in bear

[16-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Likewise#6767
right, and I think we havent seen the lows yet for BTC, thinking one more drop to 2500$ 2600$ level.

[16-Feb-19 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
but if BTC just keeps going sideways, KMD can gradually climb from 20k to 30k

I wont bother to predict BTC as a single person can totally control the price

[16-Feb-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and how to predict behavior of a single person

[16-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Likewise#6767
I feel honored speaking to Satoshi himself 😃

[16-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Likewise#6767

[16-Feb-19 08:54 PM] Likewise#6767

[16-Feb-19 08:55 PM] Likewise#6767
anyway indeed for now 20 to 30 sats will be the range, liking the 5% and love it that I cvan keep my stash on the ledger.

huge action on upbit kmd/krw

[17-Feb-19 12:44 AM] yorklab#7270
Sellers always there it seems. Still, a bit unusual for what is normally a slow period on a weekend. Perhaps we're about to see much more of this action. Fun to watch when I'm able to do so.

[17-Feb-19 12:46 AM] Markus#5464
well someone bought a big stack of kmd for 1$ each on kmd/usd market

[17-Feb-19 12:46 AM] Markus#5464
i quess this is why it happened 😄

[17-Feb-19 12:48 AM] yorklab#7270
I guess Bittrex knew what they were doing when they created the usd market for kmd. I wasn't sure it would get much action this early, but somehow I think perhaps they did.

[17-Feb-19 01:04 AM] Markus#5464
the one buying might have triggered next run upwards 😄

[17-Feb-19 01:13 AM] Vertigo#0439
Ok now VTC is up 100%

[17-Feb-19 01:14 AM] Vertigo#0439
Wtf is going on

[17-Feb-19 01:15 AM] Vertigo#0439
107

[17-Feb-19 01:19 AM] crumb#2550
STORJ was also up more than 100% on Bittrex. now hovers around 92%

[17-Feb-19 01:32 AM] yorklab#7270
Wow, didn't realize it shot to 30k on Bittrex

[17-Feb-19 01:32 AM] Markus#5464
really?

[17-Feb-19 01:32 AM] yorklab#7270
On the BTC market.

[17-Feb-19 01:33 AM] Markus#5464
o wow thought it was only on the usd market not on the btc

[17-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Shinzo Abe#9369

[17-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Markus#5464
how many confirmations do bittrex require?

[17-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Markus#5464
120 also?

[17-Feb-19 01:42 AM] yorklab#7270
@Shinzo Abe I think this is just the beginning of things to come - but only my opinion.

[17-Feb-19 01:43 AM] yorklab#7270
You'll have to decide for yourself.

[17-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Markus#5464
kmd sold for 1.132$ on usd market

[17-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Likewise#6767

[17-Feb-19 02:13 AM] Likewise#6767

[17-Feb-19 02:13 AM] NNoperator#3835

[17-Feb-19 02:14 AM] NNoperator#3835

[17-Feb-19 02:14 AM] Likewise#6767

[17-Feb-19 02:15 AM] Likewise#6767

[17-Feb-19 02:15 AM] NNoperator#3835
Gotta rip  open some casascius coins

[17-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Likewise#6767
never heard ofthem

[17-Feb-19 02:17 AM] NNoperator#3835
before you heard about BTC probably.

[17-Feb-19 02:18 AM] NNoperator#3835
they are just tokens that also happen to hold paper wallets

[17-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Likewise#6767
ok

[17-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Cryptofist#7504
someone really wants that weekly to have a proper close above 22k sats

[17-Feb-19 02:20 AM] NNoperator#3835
highest weekly volume in over a year,  looking good.

[17-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Likewise#6767
Indeed Volume picked up in the last few hours, we were at 150 BTC on binance now back at 286 BTC

[17-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
The chart is one thing, but I think people are starting to actually look at the sheer mass of work KMD has done in the last year. nice line up of TA and FA I suppose. I hope it makes some more magic happen on the charts here..

been doing my best buying as many I can

[17-Feb-19 02:26 AM] NNoperator#3835
I hope a good portion of those 590k KMD that traded earlier leave the exchange.  Where do they materialize from, the order books don't have anywhere near that amount?

[17-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Likewise#6767
majority of mine I keep on Ledger

[17-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Likewise#6767
safely tucjed away

[17-Feb-19 02:43 AM] yorklab#7270
```Where do they materialize from, the order books don't have anywhere near that amount?```
For a coin that pays you to keep it off the exchange, I'm always amazed at all the sellers waiting for the slightest movement upward.

[17-Feb-19 02:43 AM] yorklab#7270
But I guess a lot of that is muscle memory.

[17-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Likewise#6767
guess that has to do with trading bagVshodl bag

@Likewise  Thanks for taking us under your wing, dad.  I was really interested in learning more the other day but Pink Pony kept interrupting and being disrespectful.

[17-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Likewise#6767
You are most welcome son, glad to be of assistance

[17-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Likewise#6767
Yeah he throw some insults to my head there, yet the kid should know that a hardened 47 year old can take quite a bit ;0

[17-Feb-19 02:50 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Likewise you can only lead a stupid animal to a water source, then they need to make the decision to drink or not.  I know that @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 is also your bastard son, like me,  but he is arrogant and feisty.

[17-Feb-19 02:50 AM] meatspoon#7860

If you create an atmosphere in which Genie can do no wrong and is allowed to be rude and aggressive to everyone.... and he posts constantly in all channels...  you are setting the tone for this discord
