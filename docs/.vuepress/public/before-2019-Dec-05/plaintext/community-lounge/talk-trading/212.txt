@grewalsatinder Yes. That's why I was attacking EMC2

[14-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Geocold51#6462
My goal was to show 1 attack against a normal coin

That rounded bottom kmd is forming is interesting

[14-Oct-18 09:00 PM] Geocold51#6462

Anybody worried that red ichmoku cloud forming on btc?

[15-Oct-18 02:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It might go up or down as always @Mark81 üòÉ

[15-Oct-18 02:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Only the whales know which way we go but i would find it very surprising that there isnt a leg up soon so they can lock in some profits, if they have not already.

[15-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Mark81#4505
Tone Vays just shorted 1btc with 5.05x leverage with stoploss over 7kusd. Its his only trade for the year  Leon Fu turned suddenly bearish on btc and extremely bearish on alts. And these guys are not fools.

[15-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Mark81#4505
And o ly way to get filled on that massive buy order for kmd is to expect big dump on prices.

[15-Oct-18 02:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Leon Fu is a donkey, so is Tone

[15-Oct-18 02:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Leon Fu and his side kick got rich investing in back channel pump and dumps like bitcoin private, not trading

[15-Oct-18 02:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Tone would be shorting from 20k if he had the balls to do so with everything he had

[15-Oct-18 02:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just like Jimmy Song charging 4k/person to become a bitcoin programmer

[15-Oct-18 02:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
For the good of the bitcoin community of course...

[15-Oct-18 02:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I find it very interesting, if any of these people had conviction why not sell everything right now? Instead of trading with 1 BTC, they would cashout all their crypto to fiat then buy in cheaper later. But they dont do anything but talk.

I can understand the need to actually do predictions when they are supposed traders, but if they had any clue they would not be so indecisive, especially after a 70% correction

[15-Oct-18 02:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like buying pressure is building. Another 12BTC added in the last 30 mins just under 18k

@hyperDEX i wish you you are right on this!

[15-Oct-18 03:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Mark81 i am not a trader but logic tells me that these gurus are not certain themselves but they need to "lead".

At the end of the day, no one knows what is going to happen. If we did, we would get counter traded to hell üòÉ

[15-Oct-18 04:14 AM] Japesmith#0609
I agree. Tone is a donkey. Jimmy Song is a tool. Don't know much about Leon Fu.

[15-Oct-18 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
wait so this is tether imploding or is BTC actually rising?

@Gordon Komodo hit 7.1k on binance USDT

[15-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so 2 billion tethers will be pumped into BTC on bitfinex?

are all exchanges that have listed dPOW-protected coins aware of adding notarizations to their confirmations logic? just saw the forkwitch tweet...

Hearing about a run on $USDT #Tether which makes sense that it would pump #bitcoin price as I've said many times in the past.

If this is a true bank run on $usdt, I would not be surprised if exchanges that have exposure to #Tether halted trading.
Would that be positive for $BTCUSD? I don't know but mid term TA picture still Bearish g NEWS never ends Bear markets. My #Bitcoin stop loss on short is...
