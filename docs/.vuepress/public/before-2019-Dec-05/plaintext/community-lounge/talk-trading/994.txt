whos right

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think trading is not gambling when the data you are trading on is not compromised. you are leveraging information to predict price movements and it has very little to do with gambling

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
arbitrage is a real service as well

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Markus#5464
true

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] dan.#2473
as long as you flip more heads than tails, you good to go. thats not gambling

[01-Aug-19 04:45 PM] Markus#5464
lol

[01-Aug-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
u have 50/50 chance how is that not gambling

[01-Aug-19 04:46 PM] Markus#5464
u cant predict outcome

[01-Aug-19 04:47 PM] dan.#2473
didnt mean for that to be literal, as long as you win more than lose* and utilize pertinant info

[01-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Which hand is flipping the coin

[01-Aug-19 04:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think that when everyone is using ta then using ta can be useful as well. but crypto? it's nuts. I can think of any precedent to the 24/7 insanity that goes on.

[01-Aug-19 04:47 PM] dan.#2473
the middle hand aka the tuna can

[01-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The beating off hand or the weak hand

[01-Aug-19 04:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bitcoin is Wall Street bots and the rest of alts are foreverpoor NEET fags who are soon to be regulated out of existence

[01-Aug-19 04:51 PM] dan.#2473
whats weird about crypto is there are a lot of market buys and low liquidity

[01-Aug-19 04:52 PM] dan.#2473
yet the whale bots seem to try to still follow some types of TA

[01-Aug-19 04:52 PM] dan.#2473
fib levels and what not

[01-Aug-19 04:53 PM] dan.#2473
jesus where did my day go

trading and gambling arent the same

[01-Aug-19 06:15 PM] nocturnal#2177
but they have some common elements

[01-Aug-19 06:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
and you can gamble with crypto for sure

[01-Aug-19 06:16 PM] nocturnal#2177
but i wouldnt call that trading

[01-Aug-19 06:45 PM] umitkara48#6464

[01-Aug-19 06:45 PM] umitkara48#6464
Why price down

[01-Aug-19 06:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
type !airdrop to get it

[01-Aug-19 06:47 PM] Lanii#8302
The money that really matters in the markets are TA

[01-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Lanii#8302
You can never compete with large companies on FA, they have all the resources to know shit ages before it goes out in the public

[01-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Lanii#8302
The only thing you can do is try to sharpen your TA skills as much as possible so you can join the big boys when they buy/sell cuz they know all there is to know FA wise

[01-Aug-19 06:49 PM] joe2x4#5987
@dan. @Caglio @grumpygoron why are you guys misrepresenting the marketing effort? You are completely leaving out the fact that Komodo public image was all over the place, now it is more focused message. The documentation was also a mess, now it is cleaned up. IBN helped massively bring things into focus. Now that the initial rebrand is done, it allows new ideas to have a stable foundation to build on. Case and point, trying to build new marketing ideas, Ie: community portal or komodo certified courses without the rebrand was pointless as noone new what the theme would be. So community marketing had to wait.

[01-Aug-19 06:50 PM] joe2x4#5987
It would be a great use of energy to come up with ideas instead of using your energy to armchair bitch

The dude saying TA is the same as gambling doesnt even know that nothing can dump more then 100% to begin with, says a lot about your brainz good sir :troll_king:

[01-Aug-19 06:53 PM] Neko#5830
but it can dump 99,9%

[01-Aug-19 06:54 PM] ResoluteCrypto#5902

[01-Aug-19 06:55 PM] Lanii#8302
I just wanna conclude with this

[01-Aug-19 06:55 PM] CoinKing88#1540
1 dollar = 1 kmd nice round number

[01-Aug-19 06:56 PM] Lanii#8302
TA is all about providing you with an entry with the easiest SL so that your idea can get invalidated asap and where you lose 1% of total capital

[01-Aug-19 06:56 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Round numbers is a myth

[01-Aug-19 06:56 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I have read somewhere but can't confirm

[01-Aug-19 06:58 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

[01-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Lanii#8302
You always expect it to "fail to lose a level"

[01-Aug-19 07:03 PM] Lanii#8302
and "fail to gain a level"
