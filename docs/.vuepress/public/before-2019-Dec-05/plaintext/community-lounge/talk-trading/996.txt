you're awesome hyperDEX for what you're able to do, but I stand by my fair points

[01-Aug-19 08:16 PM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, I like mister hyperdex also, he isnt a little bitch like that brittish commie

[01-Aug-19 08:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@dan. most people say they are not being paid so why should they help. This is the wrong way to think about it. If you were walking around and every day you keep dropping change from your pocket because there is a hole. Would you say, bloody wife still has not mended that hole whilst doing nothing to stop the change falling out?

[01-Aug-19 08:19 PM] Caglio#3337
Its not actually a wrong way

[01-Aug-19 08:19 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean, every effort should be appreciated

[01-Aug-19 08:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ðŸ˜„ but what you dont know is there are many holes, every time you tell her she mends different holes, some fully some partially.

[01-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Caglio#3337
Some people like to work for free, some dont, I mean if you can pay ideas by nature for amazing marketing they done, why not pay someone else

[01-Aug-19 08:21 PM] dan.#2473
i get you, but, I dont think it hurts to have specific criticisms for people that have paid positions or for work that was oursourced

[01-Aug-19 08:21 PM] dan.#2473
maybe discussing it publically isnt the best thing cause it can affect morale, but not sure where else to go

[01-Aug-19 08:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh i agree.

[01-Aug-19 08:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But if you do nothing about it, that is the problem

[01-Aug-19 08:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We are a open source project not with unlimited funds

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How many are willing to contribute to more marketing?

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] Caglio#3337
But dont you think fair criticism is also doing something, when many others just turn the head and for some reason dont notice that ?

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] Caglio#3337
I mean if thing arent going well, and everyone pretends they are

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is bad too

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats harming whole situation

[01-Aug-19 08:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes so there are different levels

[01-Aug-19 08:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But if you know there is a problem, the solution is to raise it sure, but in the short term change is hard so you do everything you can to enact change

[01-Aug-19 08:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So if you think marketing sucks, do better marketing

[01-Aug-19 08:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure you dont get paid, but if it increases you investment is that not good for you?

[01-Aug-19 08:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If you have a look at marketing chat, i am doing basically 80 hour weeks so couldnt do it myself, i asked people to get links to youtubers that do live streams, i dont see anyone putting up their hands to do that. That is nothing hard just takes time

[01-Aug-19 08:24 PM] crumb#2550
and doing a good job might get you noticed and perhaps you **will get** a paid job

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] crumb#2550
walking the walk tells a lot

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
True that

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] dan.#2473
caglio has a point, i mean, i am actually an introvert, i am feel very strongly to discuss these things publically. and im really not even _that_ perverse with what I am trying to say. Certain things are done well, others not so much. This discussion all started for me because I keep trying to point out something trivial like the logo looking like shit on dark mode CMC but team members are literally commenting on the post below my post. I think having a logo that looks like it didnt come out of a gif machine isnt _that_ important, but its easy to fix or acknowledge and looks more professional if its done right.

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Caglio#3337
Hm, but you should also understand my point

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I invested 10k

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I have 2k

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] Caglio#3337
And someone is paid to do a job and do it horrible

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] crumb#2550
i understang your point Caglio

[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] dan.#2473
also @hyperDEX as many have, I did invest in the ICOs, hence helping the project

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] Caglio#3337
So after I lost my initial 8k which is over a year of work in my shitty country, I should go fight for something while one who is paid dont do it

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Not fair I would say

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@dan. now are you willing to step up and help your investment?

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] crumb#2550
but just concentrating on what you have *lost* is not helping anyone

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] crumb#2550
especially you

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio but you lost 30k at the casino, perspective

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] dan.#2473
As mentioned earlier I took 95 percent of my profits, because well, ive been through this multiple times

[01-Aug-19 08:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Exactly

[01-Aug-19 08:27 PM] dan.#2473
i am still vested, just not 100 percent vested

[01-Aug-19 08:27 PM] Caglio#3337
Thats why I am not killing myself over it, but when I lost money in casino noone told me anything. However this channel is full of good advices

[01-Aug-19 08:27 PM] dan.#2473
Also, besides today, I absolutely dont have the time... todays the first day in about 2 years ive spent all day on here

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] tolken#2655
No love for Kmd? ðŸ˜›

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Caglio#3337
When I hear them I just cannot stay calm and not to answer them

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Caglio#3337
I love KMD, I wouldnt be here if I didnt love it

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] Caglio#3337
However lately I am losing my sympathy more and more

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] dan.#2473
dpow and marketmaker? awesome tech

[01-Aug-19 08:28 PM] dan.#2473
antara aws stuff? not a fan

[01-Aug-19 08:29 PM] dan.#2473
i like the idea as a novelty, but its too expensive

[01-Aug-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Different markets

[01-Aug-19 08:29 PM] dan.#2473
yes

[01-Aug-19 08:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Does apple just make 2k phones?

[01-Aug-19 08:29 PM] crumb#2550
'expectation management' is appropriate in this case. what is the thesis for getting involved and/or buying KMD

[01-Aug-19 08:30 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Also no time is a cop out. You could have sent 100 tweets for the time you were here ðŸ˜„

[01-Aug-19 08:30 PM] crumb#2550
just price action alone is very poor indicator

[01-Aug-19 08:30 PM] dan.#2473
well no, but is there an enterprise market for antara? im curious how much revs there are or what the projection is

[01-Aug-19 08:30 PM] crumb#2550
gotta look the bigger picture. even if it seems that most people around you seem not to ðŸ˜ƒ

[01-Aug-19 08:31 PM] crumb#2550
price going down. ok, so is the tech getting worse?

[01-Aug-19 08:31 PM] crumb#2550
what is your investment/involvement thesis?

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] dan.#2473
users is whats important

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] dan.#2473
or community

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] tolken#2655
I donâ€™t see Antara / Aws as expensive, considering what it does. If you donâ€™t need a blockchain, thatâ€™s another story - anything other than Freemium will seem too expensive.

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
He doesn't see the big picture and that all alts go down , now find many thing marketing whatever etc to blame , none but himself for not knowing what is a stoploss

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Suddenly kmd is shit etc

[01-Aug-19 08:32 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lol

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] dan.#2473
ðŸ™„

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] dan.#2473
you all are putting words in my mouth

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] crumb#2550
kmd is a underlying layer. so right now it seems that developers are KMD's target audience

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Not you mate

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@dan.

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] dan.#2473
ok

[01-Aug-19 08:33 PM] tolken#2655
This chatter always accelerates in days line this, then melts away the next time the price surges, which it will.

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Chatter intensifies at market bottoms

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@tolken

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Caglio#3337
@mrtzmp3 Dude, I was saying marketing team is shit even before we dropped under 10k, we were are 20k I was saying it

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
You are the biggest anti marketing kmd has mate

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Caglio#3337
Hahaha

[01-Aug-19 08:34 PM] Caglio#3337
I wont even comment on this ( :

[01-Aug-19 08:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

@Caglio

[01-Aug-19 08:35 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Beside your non stop complaints

[01-Aug-19 08:35 PM] crumb#2550
Caglio, please contribute if you know how. your point of not being happy with marketing is well established. seems like beating a dead horse for a while now

[01-Aug-19 08:35 PM] crumb#2550
not really productive

[01-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Caglio#3337
Maybe it is, more and more unhappiness here may lead to better things

[01-Aug-19 08:36 PM] crumb#2550
more misery equals happiness?

[01-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Caglio#3337
No no

[01-Aug-19 08:36 PM] dan.#2473
yall are giving me anxiety lol

[01-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Caglio#3337
But if everyone is happy with the way things are going, nothing will ever change ( :

[01-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Caglio#3337
But ok, lets stop it, I am bored

[01-Aug-19 08:37 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
