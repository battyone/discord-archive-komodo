why not top holder in 20 chains?????

[14-Apr-19 10:20 AM] crumb#2550
the ones complaining are those who don't (want to) make an effort to dig deeper. there is no one central place where they expect to be updated constantly. one sign that many people don't grasp the concept of decentralisation

[14-Apr-19 10:22 AM] crumb#2550
there will always be complainers in everything

[14-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yup

[14-Apr-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also as far as assets from NXT days go, I have added specific monetization for all except PANGEA and that is being added to the CHIPS poker in the coming months

[14-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
when the new CC based chains come online, then all the NXT days assets will have a way to make revshares. now whether they do or not, is out of my control. I can only build it. with JUMBLR, it was there, but not many people used it. PIRATE ends up being a much better way for privacy anyway. cant win them all

[14-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is there a way to have superNET buy a bunch of ARRR and prove it has them by using cc? Sort of like a peg token 1:1 for ARRR

[14-Apr-19 10:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I remember reading that it wasnt possible for superNET to buy ARRR as it wasnt transparant, but that may be a way to circumvent that, without violating the shielded properties of the ARRR coins?

[14-Apr-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
when ZEC gets viewing keys. please pester them to finish it. I realize they are operating on a limited budget and maybe dont have the resources for such an extra feature

regarding JUMBLR it is waaaayy ahead of its time. i may take a decade for people to understand that they actually need privacy in finance and there is nothing nefarious behind it

[14-Apr-19 11:06 AM] crumb#2550
joe sixpack might not get it until the end of time

[14-Apr-19 11:09 AM] crumb#2550
you can lead a horse to the river, but you can't make it drink @jl777c

[14-Apr-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I am think to just recommend people to use PIRATE if they want privacy. one years of rewards and you can get 1:1 PIRATE to all the KMD you have

shexy 👌 

[14-Apr-19 01:30 PM] mobipoi#5774
Wont ppl be able to create their own version of pirate, using the kmd platform

[14-Apr-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the only point for doing that is for privacy, there is no added value with a smaller anon set

[14-Apr-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so i am disabling this option in the code, also we wouldnt be notarizing such an anon set fragmenting chain

[14-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Mark81#4505

Bitpanda asked me for kyc when registering

[14-Apr-19 03:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Easy to use though

[14-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
A bit on the expensive side fee-wise

[14-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But that the price you pay for convenience I guess

[14-Apr-19 03:04 PM] Markus#5464
it would be nice to able to buy KMD in similar way to localbitcoins

[14-Apr-19 03:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Localcrypto

[14-Apr-19 03:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Buy anything P2P

[14-Apr-19 03:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Comms via zmessaging if there is such a thing

[14-Apr-19 03:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Mandatory tor or non-nsa equivalent

[14-Apr-19 03:12 PM] McBeastie#0134
how do you get 1:1 PIRATE for KMD?

[14-Apr-19 03:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
buy a good miner

[14-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
i saw theres like 80m Pirate but pretty much no market how come

[14-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Markus#5464
liquidity is close to 0

[14-Apr-19 03:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Because people are clantards

[14-Apr-19 03:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
83002880 give or take

[14-Apr-19 03:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Best solution != most popular

[14-Apr-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but pretty much no market how come`
because no kind soul has come forward and offered the $millions that major exchanges want to even consider adding it

[14-Apr-19 03:16 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or some bullshit FUD like “teh genar sarmony wuz combermised”

[14-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
so Pirate kinda hope for MM2 to bring liquidity to it?

[14-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
or what is the plan

[14-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Acura#2748

You can’t atomic swap z transactions yet

[14-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
At least I don’t think so

[14-Apr-19 03:17 PM] Markus#5464
right forgot about it

[14-Apr-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
but in the end what is the use case for Pirate?

[14-Apr-19 03:18 PM] Markus#5464
just to be anonymous?

[14-Apr-19 03:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but in the end what is the use case for Pirate?`
but in the end what is the use case for currency?

[14-Apr-19 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a privacy currency

[14-Apr-19 03:20 PM] Markus#5464
So Pirate just being a privacy coin acting like btc, just privacy and value

[14-Apr-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
digitalprice has ARRR/KMD market so you can directly trade KMD for ARRR

[14-Apr-19 03:21 PM] Markus#5464
store of value

[14-Apr-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
store of value now

[14-Apr-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and direct private payments

[14-Apr-19 03:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
BTC is far more of a commodity than a currency

[14-Apr-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why i say to use the rewards to buy PIRATE, now is a decent time as the price has been stable for a while close to mining costs and halving is in about a month

[14-Apr-19 03:22 PM] Markus#5464
Okay so u can compare Pirate to Monero?

[14-Apr-19 03:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@FishyGuts wrote a paper on that

[14-Apr-19 03:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pirate is a better monero and zec

[14-Apr-19 03:23 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

thanks @Acura i'm looking at options for selling 300kmd / month for fiat so €500 / day is more than i need

[14-Apr-19 05:11 PM] jspook16#3059
@jl777c are you suggesting kmd rewards be used to acquire pirate. Or is pirate now providing rewards? I've been out for a while

[14-Apr-19 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jspook16 `use the rewards to buy PIRATE`

[14-Apr-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully "use the rewards to by PIRATE" is not ambiguous. in case it is, use the KMD rewards to buy PIRATE

[14-Apr-19 05:14 PM] LeshAft9#0083
does digitalprice.io make you do identity verification at all?

[14-Apr-19 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not for small amounts

[14-Apr-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the biggest anon set has the best privacy and PIRATE has the largest anon set in crypto now

[14-Apr-19 05:15 PM] LeshAft9#0083
do you have to sync the full kmd blockchain to use agama for PIRATE wallet?

[14-Apr-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
more than ZEC, due to 85% of ZEC being in transparent addresses and PIRATE 1 min block vs ZEC 2.5 min

[14-Apr-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is an INDEPENDENT chain from KMD

[14-Apr-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
you can therefor sync PIRATE INDEPENDENTLY

[14-Apr-19 05:16 PM] jspook16#3059
Thanks

[14-Apr-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I have a feeling the 0.03 KMD price for PIRATE will be seen as the "good old days"

[14-Apr-19 05:17 PM] LeshAft9#0083
hmm. I know I was asking about this earlier, but I'm wondering how it verifies PIRATE chain without having KMD and even BTC also locally available. I think I need to finish reading https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/custom-consensus-overview.html

[14-Apr-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries do

[14-Apr-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the protocol is done so notarization is done to the destination chain first, then to the source chain so the destination notarization can be found

[14-Apr-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
that means if a normal node sees a notarization, it can conclude that the notarization is on the KMD chain. Of course, it can directly verify via SPV server if it wanted to

[14-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm arrr halving in 43 days...

[14-Apr-19 06:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[14-Apr-19 06:38 PM] dokrates#8987
how much now per block?

[14-Apr-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
256arrr I think

[14-Apr-19 06:39 PM] dokrates#8987
si a reduction to 128 right?

[14-Apr-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So big drop in daily mining rewards

[14-Apr-19 06:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[14-Apr-19 06:41 PM] dokrates#8987
do you have a link for a chart of rewards-time

[14-Apr-19 06:41 PM] dokrates#8987
so i can see how it will be reduced within next years

[14-Apr-19 06:42 PM] crumb#2550
current 24h emission 368 640 PIRATE
after 27th of may 184 320

[14-Apr-19 06:42 PM] crumb#2550
