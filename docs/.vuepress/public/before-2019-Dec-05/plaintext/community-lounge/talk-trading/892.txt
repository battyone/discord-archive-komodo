I was paid in end also, as things changed iny personal life I could no longer work for free. But while I was learning why get paid, all I did was mostly break things for  many months

[05-Jul-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I sold all my kmd weeks ago

Its meh I had to do something to pay for all new furniture and a car after wife moved out.

[05-Jul-19 09:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Here is the thing that  people should ponder themselves, even if you had a 0.001% of you doing something to get more users/devs/price appreciation with whatever you are doing, would you not do it?

Thought at first I had no chance to create any value, but go look at my github now...

[05-Jul-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It all starts from somewhere!

[05-Jul-19 09:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No effort is wasted when it is something you are passionate about

[05-Jul-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's it, the cc I am creating on labs right now, may be simple and not so useful bit it makes CCS like 10x easier to make. That is value creation, as it saves everyone time in future.

[05-Jul-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Still without something ppl can easily use, it won't drive coin price that much.

[05-Jul-19 09:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully these changes lay the groundwork for cc spv stuff. So lite clients will work

[05-Jul-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is exactly it and when your NN depends on that and your for profit business depends on that tech, it is rich to say im not getting paid for marketing so i wont do it just in case it is against the tules

[05-Jul-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There are no rules... Everyone can do what they want really. If your invested then u would only do things to better the ecosystem right?

[05-Jul-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Exactly.

[05-Jul-19 09:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Has anyone ever said more marketing is bad? @coingirl87 would have a heart attack

[05-Jul-19 09:35 AM] jansako#3330
Here is the main issue though. If you do not want others to tell you what to do, do not presume to tell them what to do. Why can anyone not choose to sit & wait? it is their right, even if you disagree with it... You can suggest but you cannot make them...

Anyways, as an idiot that needed a easy to use GUI and a way to claim rewards on ledger, we now have a solution for both. Anyone can have a impact on the ecosystem, the question is who will step up!

[05-Jul-19 09:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jansako  if you suggest someone else to do it for free, you dont have the right to say you wont do it unless you got paid, because no one would do it

[05-Jul-19 09:36 AM] jansako#3330
That way your great work will get more recognition! (not trolling)

[05-Jul-19 09:38 AM] jorian#4555
we are making a GUI that allows users to be marketmakers so i guess i'm doing what you say i should be doing

My issue is with this mentality of most of the community that we need to sit around and depend on the marketing team. Why does doge have any marketing?

[05-Jul-19 09:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jorian that is the spirit, so why dissuade others from taking that initiative?

[05-Jul-19 09:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Unless they get paid

[05-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
we have always been sitting around and waiting for the marketing team

[05-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
now they finally have a decent bureau

[05-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
no way i'm going to interfere with that

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jorian#4555
and i'm doing marketing in different ways

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But the thing is community effort + professionals > just professionals

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The thing is, do you know what they are planning? There is no rules here

[05-Jul-19 09:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We can do whatever marketing we like, look at @Hollowman9000 as an example

[05-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jorian#4555
i hope ideas by nature is not secretly hollowman üòÅ

[05-Jul-19 09:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well we dont know üòõ

[05-Jul-19 09:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Also Hollowman might be a paid PR pro

[05-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jorian#4555
proving my point üòÑ

savant as they say

[05-Jul-19 09:44 AM] jorian#4555
`do you know what they are planning?` the fact i don't know is exactly what is keeping me to start spreading random messages

[05-Jul-19 09:44 AM] jorian#4555
if it's a coordinated effort, let's keep it coordinated

I think we need to agree to disagree. We are in the wild wild west, it could be a hollowman tweet that gets the attention of a billion dollar company ceo that laughs at his non PC tweet and decides to invest

[05-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jorian#4555
i sure hope so

[05-Jul-19 09:46 AM] jorian#4555
maybe we can finally have some use of WLC

[05-Jul-19 09:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Whereas they dont bat an eye at the professional PR message

[05-Jul-19 10:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So, we are somehow wrong in whatever stance we take? @hyperDEX

[05-Jul-19 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think we have helped a lot from the community side of marketing. Much more than many others.

[05-Jul-19 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not sure what the point of the argument is.

[05-Jul-19 11:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
A blog post about what atomicdex is should be a coordinated part of the whole campaign being worked on.

[05-Jul-19 11:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep but do you think the marketing team would stop by in trading to get marketing ideas? My whole point is that, if you want to do something people should take the initiative to get it done, otherwise if everyone is waiting for everyone else to do it, it wont ever get done.

[05-Jul-19 11:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Agree, but if you start doing everything on your own, there is a high chance things become duplicated efforts and have mixed messages

[05-Jul-19 11:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I was responding to Jorian but it was mostly directed to all the community members that spout when marketing and sit on their asses waiting for the marketing fairy to do something.

[05-Jul-19 11:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I would argue, more marketing regardless if there is an overlap is better than less marketing.

[05-Jul-19 11:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You never know which one would be more effective

[05-Jul-19 11:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Professional marketing has pros and cons, grass roots/gorilla marketing has pros and cons too. Which one will appeal to a business and which one will appeal to a crypto billionaire? No one knows but if we use the shotgun approach, we will cover all of our bases

[05-Jul-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
About the mixed messages thing, i dont think there is any confusion between what hollowman puts out on twitter and what the teams marketing department puts out. There is a role to play here for the non professionals

[05-Jul-19 11:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think the community has been quite active and have had many different ideas to make the kmd ecosystem grow. Now its the time for the hired team to show their work, so at this point it really is better to just wait.

[05-Jul-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
let us just agree to disagree

[05-Jul-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
this goes in circles

[05-Jul-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
different people do different things

[05-Jul-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody is forced to do anything

[05-Jul-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
any social media posts by people is appreciated

[05-Jul-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
official marketing cannot do more than the initial posts, it is up to the community to repost, etc.

[05-Jul-19 11:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, sadly the reddit post was taking traction and got banned for "brigading"

[05-Jul-19 11:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe could have been my fault because i linked it here directly and told everyone to pass by and give some upvotes

[05-Jul-19 11:20 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I didnt see it as any harm, but it seems it did.

[05-Jul-19 11:20 AM] Markus#5464
Not using reddit but i can imagine it being heaven for projects like XRP and EOS, everything else what have a chance to exceed their shill getting taken care off

[05-Jul-19 11:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
NANO

You go there and you see the same coins always

[05-Jul-19 11:21 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
NEO, NANO, EOS, XRP... Etc

[05-Jul-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think twitter is much better at getting the word out, with reddit you have to visit that reddit and click on the link, with twitter you can be tagged or see it in others timelines, so exposure wise it is much better

[05-Jul-19 11:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im no expert on making things go viral

Six degrees of separation

there are quite a few community members that actively spread the good word about KMD (and other community projects) on twitter. @grewalsatinder @KomodoWorld @Cryptoon and many many others. just follow their lead and everybody will be better off

[05-Jul-19 11:29 AM] crumb#2550
i made a twitter account little more than year ago, just to engage is relevant conversations and spread the word

[05-Jul-19 11:30 AM] crumb#2550
just mindless spamming does not work anyways. it's better to find relevant conversations and join in

[05-Jul-19 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No one is talking about mindlessly spamming like the XRP army, we need to be smart to get a response from the "target"
