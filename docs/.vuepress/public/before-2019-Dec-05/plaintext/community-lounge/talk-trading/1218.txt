Did we drop to .618 and did it act as support? Or was it just 20ma?

[23-Nov-19 05:59 PM] Mark81#4505
Oh, there's .618 near 50ma at so it was just 20ma after taking a good look of chart.

[23-Nov-19 06:45 PM] Bitfinger#6245
That 60c bounce was real, but I have some weakness t 68c that will probably be retested soon

@tolken Yes. All you need to know for 2020 is dick math. Forget all the fancy TAs

[23-Nov-19 09:16 PM] richardt#2807
Jokes aside, I think crypto is poised for a big move in 2020. New decade, new outlook. BTC halving, potential global economic recession, and even new U.S. presidential election will have an effect.  Not to mention many things going on in other countries.

[23-Nov-19 09:17 PM] richardt#2807
Don't know if the move will be positive or negative. Perhaps we'll see an inverse dick math

[24-Nov-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
decent buy support for kmd also, might create a lower high which is pretty good sign that we might have bottomed

anyone have issues with atomiclab ledger collecting rewards?

[25-Nov-19 09:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
can anyone confirm i can use same ledger send to another address (with the 25th keyword option, so different set of keys) then send back?

[25-Nov-19 09:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or theres no timelock/doesnt work like that with ledger

[25-Nov-19 10:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Crabby Paddy You would basically compromise all the addresses in the ledger if you use the seed to login, if you really need to do it, on a offline computer that will never go online, do the bip39 converter for the seed, get the private key for the current address where funds are, use privkey to log into say agama then transfer it, this way only that privkey is compromised not the whole ledger

[25-Nov-19 10:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But i hope @lukechilds will be online in the next day to sort it out.

[25-Nov-19 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
Qubes OS with `valut` VM does the job of offline computer which is isolated from other VMs, no network connection or other device access.

[25-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I meant use ledger address 1 to send to 2 would that work?

[25-Nov-19 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, it should work

[25-Nov-19 01:21 PM] jorian#4555
who is ready for some hyperdex with mm2.0 support?

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 spv such a big drain on connection?

[25-Nov-19 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont think so

[25-Nov-19 02:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I dont even understand how native would work better with bad internet

[25-Nov-19 03:09 PM] Oszy#5734
Maybe he runs native all the time is using less bw vs spv needs to download block headers every time you connect

[25-Nov-19 03:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but that's only a couple of kb, no?

[25-Nov-19 03:52 PM] crumb#2550

`I dont even understand how native would work better with bad internet`
because of the amount of data being polled has to be piped every single time vs what already exists locally, crumb hit the nail on the head

[25-Nov-19 08:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@AkiraX  yes, we have just been added to their marketplace. Can buy and sell KMD with USD and earn MTL for doing it. Also does Normal usd transfers too I believe

[25-Nov-19 08:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but that's only a couple of kb, no?`
for each of the trillion calls over the course of time, it adds up

[25-Nov-19 08:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not just headers, but all the data
any data you have in a trading app is regularly being refreshed by polling again
each thing is much, by itself; *all the things* add up

[25-Nov-19 08:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
plus...
why poll someone ele's node when I literally have 3?

Aha got it, but should be better with nspv right?

[25-Nov-19 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
*maybe* if you don't already run nodes
but it will never be better to use any spv than to use an already running local node 😛

[25-Nov-19 09:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, then there's always the added layer of "metadata" trust

[25-Nov-19 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
which is a separate issue, but one that is still a thing
