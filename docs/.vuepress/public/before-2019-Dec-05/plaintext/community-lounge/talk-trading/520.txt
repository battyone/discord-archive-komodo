Is being asic resistance still a thing? I thought people got off that hype train five years ago. Still remember getting hate because I didn't see anything wrong with asics.

[06-Apr-19 04:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I didn't see anything wrong with asics.`
neither does anyone else that wants added security in their chain 😛

[06-Apr-19 04:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
imo ASIC (and technology in general) are neither good or bad, it's up to how you use it, you can choose to secure or attack the chain.

[06-Apr-19 04:44 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The big reason behind asic resistant at the time was so that people with one gpu could have a chance to mine a block. I would ask what is to stop the same people with warehouses of asics to just make warehouses of gpu, cpu, or even bald headed monks if that is what it takes to mine a block.

[06-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Even Burstcoin made it to where you mine with harddrives and the running the joke was the biggest miner is Western Digital.

[06-Apr-19 07:33 PM] Sdunbar#5064
look how many wallets are out there

[06-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Sdunbar#5064
well maybe the average gets pulled up the by monster wallets

[06-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Sdunbar#5064
but not below median thats for sure

[06-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Sdunbar#5064
median is probably like 5 kmd \

[06-Apr-19 07:34 PM] Sdunbar#5064
5 not 5k

[06-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Sdunbar#5064
damn gotta say im always sad to see KMD deranking itself while the others run up

[06-Apr-19 07:35 PM] Sdunbar#5064
seems to happen when the market as a whole is pumping

[06-Apr-19 07:58 PM] Keppie#5156
Chart just asks for a retest of trendline or main supportline. We’ll be fine 😉

[06-Apr-19 09:10 PM] Markus#5464
alot of btc action

[06-Apr-19 09:10 PM] Markus#5464
xD

[06-Apr-19 09:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
btc action on either direction doesn't look good for kmd 😂

[06-Apr-19 10:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so what makes a coin worth a lot?

[06-Apr-19 10:39 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so you are saying that KMD will not ever be worth a lot then 😄

[06-Apr-19 10:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
in this case , I see BTC is like Windows - Mircrosoft

[06-Apr-19 10:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Komodo is the big looser in this game.`
*for now

[06-Apr-19 10:41 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
KMD is like linux

[06-Apr-19 10:42 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
The way I see it, is exposure, if more and more people use Barterdex, they are going to be exposed to KMD one way or another

[06-Apr-19 10:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I believed that KMD was destined to stay on the charts where it is, there's no part of me that would be here

to me, KMD is still looking like a project working in the garage ,with many other garage projects in the ecosystem. Not saying it is good or bad

[06-Apr-19 10:52 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the question is how long this stage is going to be

I think the garage analogy fit better 2 years ago than now; maybe I've been sniffing too many 🌈s 🤷🏽

any particular reason the supernet link on this results to a dangerous link ?  <http://web.archive.org/web/20150512195922/http://209.126.70.170/SuperNET.pdf>

[06-Apr-19 10:58 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201

[06-Apr-19 10:59 PM] Mupps2006#9371

[06-Apr-19 11:00 PM] Mupps2006#9371
did he give up the domain or somet ?

[06-Apr-19 11:03 PM] Mupps2006#9371
Ok, i opened it up, at first it asked to install a browser plugin, then after brought up a disruptive webpage

[07-Apr-19 12:36 AM] 74D30#6106
And the shapeshift begins

[07-Apr-19 01:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The old website was supernet.org not thesupernet.org .  It currently redirects to komodoplatform.com ( definitely wasn’t wasting the backlinking that was done the original ) .  Nothing to be concerned about

[07-Apr-19 02:46 AM] 74D30#6106
The shapeshift to KMD is working!!!!

still looks bullish to me

[07-Apr-19 01:12 PM] klein#5233
can retrace more of this move yet and still be in a healthy up move

[07-Apr-19 01:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
given that the 1st 1/2 of the double market has risen, it only stands to reason that it will close lower (and atm the hopscotch value is still up a bit)
