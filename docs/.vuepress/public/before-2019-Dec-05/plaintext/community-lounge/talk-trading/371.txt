I mean if something is unusable from both back & front end point of view, it won't be used

[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Core features and it's strong support of multiple things along with extreme flexibility to adopting almost anything

[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is what kmd is

[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the komodo daemon, is already able to do some very special things...

[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will not agree to kmd not usable in backend

[07-Jan-19 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is usable since 2014

[07-Jan-19 02:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

what any project can do... kmd can likley do it right now... or easily with some small mods.

[07-Jan-19 02:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The only hurdle I guess any dev might be having adopting is their misconception on kmd infrastructure or no knowledge of it's inner working

[07-Jan-19 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hence extreme need of dev education sources

[07-Jan-19 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This year I'm sure we will fill that to much extent

for something to get adopted main stream it needs to be easy of use, look at windows.

In another analogy,  kmd is also like Intel Inside

Nice UI, bad dev experience

[07-Jan-19 06:03 AM] Likewise#6767
hmm, yet it is more used then KMD

[07-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Likewise#6767
It is not what tech geeks like that sells, it is what consumers feel they need or want.

[07-Jan-19 07:15 AM] Meyse#0952
consumers dont need kmd, its the things that get developed on kmd that could give consumers what they want

a few altbtc pairs are selling, I guess it's follow the crowd time...

[07-Jan-19 10:42 AM] ver_User#6608
about this linux windows analogy, did linux ever make any money?

considering we would probably all like price to go up, I guess it's a fair point

whether it's a UI or not, what exactly do we do to bring in the speculators to inflate the market cap? üòÉ

[07-Jan-19 10:45 AM] ver_User#6608
about price, this is the middle of the consolidation range, should be support around here in theory

[07-Jan-19 10:46 AM] ver_User#6608
I'm having a hard time trusting BTC here for more upside though, today should be quite telling

Microsoft, 780 Billion

Linux Red Hat, 2 Billion

;)


Apples and oranges I know but... Windows probably takes up a nice chunk of that value right?

[07-Jan-19 12:04 PM] ver_User#6608
I'm not disputing Linux true value, that probably can't be quantified. Plus I'm not a coder so wouldn't even know where to start, just thinking about how value might come into the price of KMD.

[07-Jan-19 12:05 PM] ver_User#6608
Aspiring to Linux may be noble, but less lucrative. Some people seem to like being sold spyware

[07-Jan-19 12:05 PM] ver_User#6608
Some sort of happy middle ground must exist

[07-Jan-19 12:12 PM] ver_User#6608
Thinking out loud, not really offering any solutions...

I saw a great TED talk by a guy who was advocating for profit charities... it was argued all the best CEO material would get taken up by for profit companies, with the general game plan that "even if I want to work for a NFP, they all pay so badly I might as well use my skills now, save some money, and do something charitible later or start my own NFP once I have years of experience under my belt".

For one thing if NFPs actually made more money, they would aquire more talent, and positive feedback loop would ensue. 

Working for an NFP may be the most noble choice, but not the most logical necessarily if you really want to make a difference (perhaps). Also competition that just comes from being in the market place, is a driver of innovation. NFP's generally aren't selling something, they are asking for something, with moral high ground. Moral high ground shouldn't be a reason not to innovate. 


So less talented CEO's making less money, less innovation (on average). Then a big company comes along with it's billions, and throws away some money at a charitable cause as an after thought for their PR campaign... while all these smaller companies work so hard

[07-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Meyse#0952
there is gonna be big buying pressure on kmd when there are a shitton of working products and services because they will all have kmd as their base currency

[07-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Meyse#0952
this will happen, 100%, the question is when, its early days

[07-Jan-19 12:16 PM] Arboreal#3777
@Meyse probably in a year or two when the working products are ready and done

[07-Jan-19 12:16 PM] Arboreal#3777
that's my bet

[07-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Meyse#0952
working products im talking about all the projects in the ecosystem already, but yeah probably 1-2yrs before we see some real uses, and there are gonna be many many more. My mind gets fucked up sometimes just thinking about all the possibilities here, just take only the dice cc, the amount of games you can make with that, its crazy. The amounts of dapps that are possible... and then you can even put in liquidity providers in each dapp so you can also make money on margins with buying/selling, let people convert their just made profits with gambling games etc. I cant emphasise enough the possibilities that are being created here by the komodo devs, its.. wow

[07-Jan-19 12:29 PM] Meyse#0952
I fantasise sometimes about having an army of gui devs, its great üòÇ

Just playing devil's advocate. When KMD is compared to Linux, and Eth to Windows, gotta wonder why one has more money than the other and how far to extend that analogy

[07-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Meyse#0952
comparisons is all fun and games and you can mold them however you want. you cant compare komodo with anything else really, its unique. just dont read too much into all the comparisons imo

[07-Jan-19 12:43 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ver_User categories you use are totally not relevant. Both Windows and Linux are working OSes. Not sure we can say so about ETH that is not scalable and single working app can clog the network.

[07-Jan-19 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
linux has far more usage, 
windows has for more usage.
market segmant is what you non linux users don't understand, and guess that's where you confused with just end user stuff.
linux is all about backend and integral business tech. it dominates the technical world than other.
eth right now having much higher value than kmd you still think of it as from the point of view where its the time difference.
eth is like pet.com of early internet.
also, we can only do analogy of cryptocurrencies with linux windows and stuff like that.
in real each cryptocurrency has it's own value as it increased by team it increases.
if not satisfied by linux being just few million and where winblows is multi million
think how bitcoin is multi billion than others. It is open source. so not exactly direct comparision to operating systems. it is just new category of software which brings very new thing in market.
kmd if you don't understand correclty, is based on bitcoin than eth like architecture.
that means, if bitcoin is of X value, KMD when gets more adoption in business where you end users won't be expecting much of the things in use, it will be invisibly serving you in backend and that usage increase will in turn increase value of kmd.

[07-Jan-19 01:47 PM] ver_User#6608
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã I was only using what others offered as comparisons and running with it for a thought experiment.

probably not my place to start talking about this stuff, I know tech better than the average user and have copies of many OS's and have tweaked them a lot for specific tasks, but won't have knowledge like most of you guys

I guess the idea here is that linux allows people to generate money and probably lots of it, but linux itself never really gains a valuation in the same way microsoft windows does, because linux isn't owned by a central company or packaged or sold in the same way (on average?). It's a decent analogy of why KMD should hold value I guess, if it is being used for lots of different money generating purposes, beyond measure.

[07-Jan-19 01:48 PM] ver_User#6608
@Meyse good point, it's how we make sense of the world, in the future we will be looking at something else and comparing to to KMD and crypto.... üòâ

[07-Jan-19 01:49 PM] ver_User#6608

I'm sticking to talking charts from now on... safer ground for me

[07-Jan-19 02:23 PM] crumb#2550
one way to look at the linux-komodo comparison is that technologically speaking you can draw a lot of similarities. with on important difference. you can 'own' part of Komodo ecosystem which is being used to build a lot of stuff upon. in linux you can't monetise the tech being used by lot of applications, that fundamentally owe a lot of their technical capabilities to linux.

this is a major difference between old internet protocols / linux and blockchain technology. in blockchain tech you can monetise both at protocol and application layers

[07-Jan-19 02:24 PM] crumb#2550
so the windows v linux comparison is apples to oranges
