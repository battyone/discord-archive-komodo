I'm wondering when this btc dominance will stop üò¢

[14-Nov-18 05:55 PM] meatspoon#7860
probably not for months if not a year or more

[14-Nov-18 06:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
PSA: if you did not exit crypto (for fiat) entirely end of 2017, it's best to go down with the ship at this point
2.5x higher than existing ATHs (at least) or bust

[14-Nov-18 06:00 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
low liq, low volume, shorts been very low for a long time, some whales decides it's time to manipulate the market and dump all their btc, they short on bitmex, since everybody is low. triggering stop losses, high margin, making profit, buy back in lower. prices jumps back to 6k. GG

[14-Nov-18 06:04 PM] Hermes#6934
Chaos surrounding Bitcoin Cash: As the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network prepares for a hard fork which would entail a hostile attempt at a takeover through a 51% attack, the markets started to react with negativity. The potential attack of miners is an event that undermines the narratives of the immutability of digital assets, and shows that in fact networks are fragile and dependent on human behavior. The unknown outcome for BCH and by extension Bitmain may be putting pressure on BTC prices.
 Miners giving up: Bitcoin mining is a thin-margin game. BTC prices above $5,800 are the absolute minimum, and some mining operations may not be viable even at higher prices.

[14-Nov-18 06:16 PM] snowdamn#2414

I don't understand why he wouldn't just sign messages with satoshi's keys if he truly was

[14-Nov-18 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
makes *0* sense that he wouldn't

[14-Nov-18 06:23 PM] snowdamn#2414
these BCH idiots are acting like it's 2013
very unprofessional coming after the exposure crypto got end of 2017
it's like they want to give crypto a bad rep ü§¶

[14-Nov-18 06:24 PM] Alright#0419

IF its someone like faketoshi dumping to manipulate price

[14-Nov-18 06:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
how much breathing room does he have before he runs out?

[14-Nov-18 06:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1M BTC volume atm over all markets

[14-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, apparently futures end tonight

[14-Nov-18 06:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so this might also be a factor

[14-Nov-18 06:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It would support the wallstreet manipulation theorem for this drop though

[14-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
also wtf bitmex is trading at 5535

[14-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and accounts for 32% of the volume

[14-Nov-18 06:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
according to cmc

[14-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Markus#5464
bitmex volume and price is not included in stats on cmc

To all BTC miners...

If you switch to mine BCH, we may need to fund this with BTC, if we do, we sell for USD and, well... we think BTC market has no room... it tanks.

Think about it. We will sell A Lot!

Consider that....
And, have a nice day

(BTC to 1000 does not phase...

[14-Nov-18 08:19 PM] Jetter73#2234
Logic is sound. Sell BTC to get USD to fund BCH mining to sell for ever decreasing BTC (decreasing BTC/BCH price) to fund BCH.

[14-Nov-18 08:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But he says the same thing backwards

[14-Nov-18 08:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
"If BCH wants to dominate hashrate, Ver will have to sell a lot of BTC to rent hashpower"

[14-Nov-18 08:25 PM] Jetter73#2234
Yes but to fund it, they will need to continue to sell.

[14-Nov-18 08:25 PM] Jetter73#2234
So his logic is not sound. If they were to do this, only wall st wins

[14-Nov-18 08:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
maybe now they'll finally realize there's no such thing as free money with forks

[14-Nov-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
faketoshi is poison imo

[14-Nov-18 08:27 PM] snowdamn#2414
they didn't have the balls to burn their BTC back then and now they get to enjoy this üòâ

[14-Nov-18 08:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
dont people need to actually buy BCH for that scheme to work?  Like, people other than Ver and Wright?

[14-Nov-18 08:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
cant think of anyone who would pay money for BCH

The more of an effect he has on price, the more vulnerable the whole space appears to an investor. combined with current market conditions csw couldn't have timed this better.
