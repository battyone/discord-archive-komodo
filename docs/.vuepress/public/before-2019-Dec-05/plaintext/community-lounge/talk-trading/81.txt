I don't understand it myself. Why do you need a word to say that you identify as what you were born as?

[03-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
To even the playing field

[03-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Normalizing the terms is discriminatory to the alphabet soup crowd

[03-Aug-18 01:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

`Why do you need a word to say that you identify as what you were born as?`
Because calling normal people "normal" is "offensive" to the abnormal.

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
but who defines what is abnormal

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
and for that matter what is normal

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
I might have blue hair, tits and a penis

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
and still identify as normal

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
no actually I identify as a rich saudian prince

[03-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Malti#3948
give me my money leftists

[03-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Malti#3948
cuz I have the right to be to which I identify

[03-Aug-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`but who defines what is abnormal`
the dictionaries that we agree upon as the references of our language - because that how societies and culture work

I'm sorry about your mental health issues; have you sought help for your delusions?

Everything is green!  Everything is great!  Rations have been increased from 4 to 3

@Malti English Oxford Living Dictionary:
`Definition of normal in English:
normal
adjective
    1Conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected.
    1.1 (of a person) free from physical or mental disorders.`

[03-Aug-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
next question?

[03-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Malti#3948
it all depends to which group you are comparing yourself. As long as the group has the same 'mutual linguistic dictionary' you can be defined as normal by them even tho in another group you'd be identified as abnormal

[03-Aug-18 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you "identify" to the group that comprises less than 1% of the general population, you're not normal; because, words

[03-Aug-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
we in crypto are not normal

[03-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

We confirm this is a bug in the Chrome app, coming from a side effect when we pushed an update to invite users to use the Ledger Live instead of the Chrome app. A wrong address was shown on the computer. Ledger will cover 100% of all losses due to the issue.

So is everybody going to dump ? Is this another dead cat bounce since bitcoin is still going sideways

[03-Aug-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What's a "bitcoin"?

[03-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why would we dump @dontrustverify

[03-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
too much hassle to wait 120 fucking confirmations

[03-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So I only buy more and hodl

Talk again in 5 years when kmd is the standard.

[03-Aug-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The largest problem the markets face is emotion and acceptance.
I still don't get how we're all feken tied to BTC and yet the markets aren't spludging all over themselves with BTC being up 16% from 3-4 weeks ago

[03-Aug-18 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
up 16% and feks act like the world is ending

[03-Aug-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Cryptoon didn't shitopia drop it back to like 20 or 30?

[03-Aug-18 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[03-Aug-18 01:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
unless atomic swaps catch on (combined with available fiat pairs for all cryptos), i wouldn't discredit BTC.  BTC/fiat fulfills a very important role in crypto

[03-Aug-18 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`BTC/fiat fulfills a very important role in crypto`
beyond delusion and hype, what role is that?

[03-Aug-18 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
liquidity

[03-Aug-18 01:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
liquidity, obligations in real world, etc.

[03-Aug-18 01:54 PM] Lumbi#8378
a lot of coins gotta go back to 'fiddy cent & below; ASIC sellers don't hodl...

[03-Aug-18 01:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jl777c but the real question is:
Is an unstable, ultra-volatile market actual liquidity with swings so wide and fast?

[03-Aug-18 01:55 PM] Lumbi#8378
CN7s show da wei

[03-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
volatile, but still the most liquid

[03-Aug-18 01:56 PM] snowdamn#2414
+1  on the need for a more stable reserve crypto

[03-Aug-18 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if . it was stable, it wouldnt have gains a zillion percent

[03-Aug-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so you cant have a high growth combined with stability

[03-Aug-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you lost $150k in the time it takes to transfer that coinage, did you really gain anything?

[03-Aug-18 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on what the cost basis was

yet it lived on for years (decades?) just because it was first and had propagated everywhere
