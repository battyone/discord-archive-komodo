@차미숙 I unrionicaly think this cycle will be the cycle of binance coin moons

[30-May-19 03:45 AM] Alexfrog#1338
everything changes

[30-May-19 03:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
Yeah I remember polo days

[30-May-19 03:45 AM] 차미숙#8912
I like bnb but i think the central point of failure is too big

[30-May-19 03:46 AM] 차미숙#8912
It all depends on CZ

[30-May-19 03:46 AM] 차미숙#8912
I can be the next eth though

[30-May-19 03:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
they already perpetrated a "hack"

[30-May-19 03:46 AM] 차미숙#8912

[30-May-19 03:47 AM] Tek#5253
i like CZ more than CSW

All it matters in crypto is that this market is sucking up hidden cash

[30-May-19 03:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
Cash that cannot go to bank directly

[30-May-19 03:49 AM] 차미숙#8912
So called dirty money

[30-May-19 03:50 AM] Tek#5253
should I buy a bag of NEO

[30-May-19 03:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think all USD bills have trace amounts of cocaine

[30-May-19 03:52 AM] 차미숙#8912
Well i say pile of cash wants to enter the financial system

[30-May-19 03:52 AM] 차미숙#8912
And it's using crypto as a medium

[30-May-19 03:58 AM] Tek#5253
there we go

[30-May-19 03:58 AM] Tek#5253
kmd coming down

[30-May-19 03:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
well I hope it's dirty money cause at least they give shit about the right to privacy

[30-May-19 04:00 AM] 차미숙#8912

[30-May-19 04:10 AM] Tek#5253
yea

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] 차미숙#8912
Alt can be up or down in satoshi

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] 차미숙#8912
But it's gonna be up in USD

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] 차미숙#8912
So it does not matter

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] 차미숙#8912
Unless it's like bitconnect 2.0

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] Markus#5464
if u want bitcoins then it matter

[30-May-19 04:12 AM] Markus#5464
why would u want usd anyway

[30-May-19 04:13 AM] 차미숙#8912
Cuz u need to pay rent?

[30-May-19 04:13 AM] Markus#5464

[30-May-19 04:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
so is binance gonna re-list bsv or was that a rumor?

[30-May-19 04:13 AM] Markus#5464
fake

[30-May-19 04:13 AM] 차미숙#8912
I'm just saying you need some usd

[30-May-19 04:14 AM] 차미숙#8912
Your Americano isn't gonna take bitcoin

[30-May-19 04:14 AM] Markus#5464
well i dont need i plan to stay in crypto not cash out so usd value is less relevant for me

[30-May-19 04:15 AM] Markus#5464
only time i would consider usd value is if i sell btc if there is potential for it to go down so i can enter at a cheaper price

[30-May-19 04:17 AM] 차미숙#8912
At this point I would say it's impossible to predict

[30-May-19 04:18 AM] Markus#5464
every financial market will have pullbacks

[30-May-19 04:18 AM] Markus#5464
even a 200$ pullback is better then nothing

[30-May-19 04:18 AM] 차미숙#8912
I'm more of a hodler

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
Too time intensive to do that

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
anyone living off crypto shouldve cashed out in late 2017 enough to live on for years i'd think.

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
What I did was buy some property in 2018 jan

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] Alexfrog#1338
selling in the bear is dumb

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] 차미숙#8912
And the rent is paying me fiat to live off

[30-May-19 04:19 AM] Tek#5253
if youo were in before 2016 and didn't cash out a lifes worth of spending in 2017

[30-May-19 04:20 AM] Tek#5253
you did bad

[30-May-19 04:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if you were in with a lot of money before 2016 yeah

[30-May-19 04:21 AM] Tek#5253
even 1000 euros was enough

[30-May-19 04:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
Do you guys remember litecoin at 3 dollars

[30-May-19 04:22 AM] Tek#5253
no i joined mid 2017

[30-May-19 04:22 AM] 차미숙#8912
I lent it out on polo for 2 years

[30-May-19 04:23 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 04:24 AM] Tek#5253
almost made back my losses of 2018  😄

[30-May-19 04:24 AM] 차미숙#8912
And then just buy some property that you wanna live

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] LocoMB#8593
🚜 👍

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] 차미숙#8912
Then get some rent for bears to come

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] 차미숙#8912
And rinse repeat

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Tek#5253
I bought every month of 2018

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Markus#5464
i doubled what i lost 2018

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Tek#5253
and every month of 2019

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Tek#5253
I'm still buying

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Tek#5253
im just going to keep buying forever

[30-May-19 04:25 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[30-May-19 04:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
yay! thats the way to go! I missed the first wave but started in 2014 / 2015 and bought every month in the long cryptowinter in 2015/16

[30-May-19 04:26 AM] Markus#5464
i hope we will have a pullback towards 6k that would be sweet

[30-May-19 04:26 AM] 차미숙#8912
Just make sure your coin is not something that can get delisted on binance

[30-May-19 04:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
then the second wave hit with Komodo,WAVES and all those wonderful platofrm ICOs

[30-May-19 04:26 AM] Tek#5253
my biggest bags are kmd dash and bch

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] Markus#5464
bch is like a never ending pump

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] Tek#5253
yeah im expecting BCH 0.1 BTC by EOY

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] Tek#5253
its actually pretty nice to use

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] Tek#5253
unlike Buttcoin core

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] LocoMB#8593
personally, I don't see DASH very positive

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i already sold my BCH at like .3 😛

[30-May-19 04:27 AM] 차미숙#8912
Good coin is hard to use

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
dash is even better than BCH to use.

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
instant send

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
1 second confirm

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
can buy coffee with it

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] 차미숙#8912
It's all about having how many btc in the end

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] LocoMB#8593
DASH has bad history, maybe not sustainable

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] 차미숙#8912
But people can always ride the wave
