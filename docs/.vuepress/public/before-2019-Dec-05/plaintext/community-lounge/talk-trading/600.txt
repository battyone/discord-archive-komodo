and panicking newbs

[03-May-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
market behaves irrationally when BTC goes up 5%+ in a day

[03-May-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
sell all the other coins to ride the BTC, then get whipsawed as BTC reverses and then sell everything to pay the loan shark

[03-May-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464
think its not only kmd but most of alt coins...Eth have been having a terrible time aswell compared to Btc

[03-May-19 05:10 PM] Markus#5464

It has always been like this with btc bull runs

[03-May-19 05:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Alts react later when btc bull is already in full force

[03-May-19 05:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Mostly all alts rallied in 2017, btc had started the past bull since 2015

It’s a dead end

[03-May-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ETH will be around a long time

[03-May-19 05:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[03-May-19 05:28 PM] jl777c#5810
