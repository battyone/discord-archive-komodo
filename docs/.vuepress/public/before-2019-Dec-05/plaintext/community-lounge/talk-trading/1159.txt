[25-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, trade related question

[25-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
What should I enable trade for

[25-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
I mean what pairs

[25-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Caglio#3337
Bitcoin ofc

[25-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Caglio#3337
And I guess 2nd one is the one I create my token on

[25-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Caglio#3337
so its either Eth or Kmd

[25-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Markus#5464
I would go with KMD definitely more benefits

[25-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah I thought that too, it also seems more friendly enviorment

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Caglio#3337
What coin is that ?

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
KMD

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Caglio#3337
tell me what to buy markus

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Caglio#3337
I cashed out

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
what did u cashout

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Caglio#3337
most of it

[25-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Caglio#3337
kmd, ltc, dash

[25-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
kmd got alot of potential in my opinion, if u dont want to risk u can put in 20% and ride the 5-10% gains

[25-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Caglio#3337
you are talking short term gains now ?

[25-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Markus#5464
yes

[25-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Caglio#3337
cos I was more like

[25-Sep-19 10:50 AM] Caglio#3337
ok

[25-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Caglio#3337
I planned to hold money on coinbase for a while, and rebuy after kmd goes under 0.50

[25-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Caglio#3337
and ltc under 40

[25-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Caglio#3337
cos I am pretty sure we are headed there in next month

[25-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Markus#5464
Thats risky thinking cause u never know where it bottoms out so i would buy abit now and then to average out ur buy in price to not risk missing out

[25-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Caglio#3337
I think I already missed out honestly

[25-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Caglio#3337
which is sad, because I had more money when I first bought in crypto

[25-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Caglio#3337
than after 2 years of holding

[25-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Caglio#3337
I missed when I bought 80 litecoins for 46$ each

[25-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Markus#5464
u have to realise that this bull cycle we are in atm have just started it should last atleast until 2021

[25-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Caglio#3337
and didnt sold @ 340$

[25-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
euphoria phase usually kicks in the last months thats when u will see hyper gains in short time

[25-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Caglio#3337
Why are we calling this cycle a bull cycle honestly

[25-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
this is just a correction it happens all the time

[25-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Caglio#3337
We just got back to bear prizes of 2017 with exception of bitcoin

[25-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
even in a bull market

[25-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Caglio#3337
We will see, I do however plan to earn some cash on my ORSA coin

[25-Sep-19 10:54 AM] Caglio#3337
That I must not forget to promote all the time

[25-Sep-19 10:55 AM] Markus#5464
just dont give up hope on crypto just cause u dont make gains, there is always new things to learn

[25-Sep-19 10:55 AM] Markus#5464
also trading will always exist even if its not crypto related it will never disappear

[25-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Caglio#3337
Its ok yeah

[25-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Caglio#3337
I do have other plan

[25-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Caglio#3337
I sold my crypto now, not all but most of it

[25-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Caglio#3337
I am in big minus due kmd investment I made back in 2017

[25-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Caglio#3337
However... I did earn some pretty decent money over the season

[25-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Caglio#3337
So now I can repay my gambling debts to ukranians

[25-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Markus#5464
just dont miss this bullrun u will regret it

[25-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Caglio#3337
If I do it now, I will save about 2000 euros, I would have to pay them for the interest

[25-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Caglio#3337
So, if we dont moon in next 2 months

[25-Sep-19 11:00 AM] Caglio#3337
I will be able to get back in pretty good, save extra 2 k euros, and feel better

[25-Sep-19 11:01 AM] Markus#5464
u should just buy and hold until euphoria phase kicks in, when u see that price starts rising in a abnormal way then u sell 50% if u feel confident to wait a little longer with the other half to catch potential additional gains

[25-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Markus#5464
Will also give u great advice altho u will have to take ur own decision for this. At this moment bitcoin is oversold on 4 hour and 1 day timeframe, never in bitcoin history have sometime lost money buying bitcoin when it was oversold. Not to mention the indecision on daily timeframe on the chart, price is making a so called "doji", means price is hovering in the middle around opening price of the candle, usually indicates reversal and in this case since we already dumped it would be to the upside.

i think it holds

[25-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Neko#5830
just bought more kmd with a credit card

[25-Sep-19 03:44 PM] Neko#5830
laugh at me

[25-Sep-19 03:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Wish i had a creditcard, would do the same

[25-Sep-19 03:47 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Everybody survived the BTC drop, KMD did ok in sats

[25-Sep-19 03:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Dollarwise its no succes story for me, bought KMD @ $ 1,60, 1,20 and 0.97 so its not great

[25-Sep-19 03:49 PM] dan.#2473
there was a 500k bid wall thats why kmd held

[25-Sep-19 03:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Whalebro? Or is that a myth? üòÑ

[25-Sep-19 03:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I enjoyed watching coins like EOS bleed so hard to be honest

[25-Sep-19 03:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
-33% at one point, that must have hurt some people

[25-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Neko#5830
at least volume at bakkt is getting good

[25-Sep-19 03:57 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Neko Is there a site with stats about that?

[25-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Neko#5830
bakkt itself- bakkt.com/index

[25-Sep-19 03:59 PM] CoinKing88#1540
So 62 BTC?

[25-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Neko#5830
each contract is 10 BTC so 620 BTC

[25-Sep-19 04:02 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Considering that there must be a fairly slow registering process that is not bad for now

[25-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Neko#5830
yep

[25-Sep-19 04:03 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Contracts are starting in dollars and settled in BTC, so actually the buying pressure is yet the come right?

[25-Sep-19 04:04 PM] Neko#5830
i don't know how long it takes but thats right

[25-Sep-19 04:05 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Did Bakkt disclose a BTC-adress where we can see how much they got "bakkt" at any given time? You might be able to see when a large buy is coming if they have too little to settle at time x.

[25-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Neko#5830
dont think so but it probably wont take long to find

[25-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Neko#5830
public ledger and stuff

[25-Sep-19 04:08 PM] Neko#5830
it probably wont take long for bakkt to add other coins

[25-Sep-19 04:10 PM] CoinKing88#1540
You think? I think the institutional investor is even cautious about BTC let alone other crypto

[25-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Neko#5830
ethereum

[25-Sep-19 05:06 PM] Markus#5464

And just like that we are back to bullish... 

Price follows hash-rate narrative like.

@Cryptoon People turn off mining and BTC price crashes?

[25-Sep-19 07:54 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I heard rumors of earthquakes, govt intervention, power issue, I dont think anyone really knew why it dropped. As of today its back to the average of 90m TH

[25-Sep-19 07:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Can you explain the mechanics to why BTC price can or did react to dropping hash rate?

[25-Sep-19 07:56 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
But yeah a big player could just shut down their rigs leading everyone to think the worst, in order to capitalize on weak hands, which may have been what happened. BTC hashrate is related to the overall security of the network so a drop in hashrate could make an attack easier

[25-Sep-19 07:57 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
A lot of psychology at play

[25-Sep-19 07:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
the cost of mining a coin has had a long established correlation with it's value. but because of it's scale btc hashrate has a ton of other side effects on everything crypto related.
