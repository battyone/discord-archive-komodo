23k, 79k

[13-Feb-19 02:29 PM] yorklab#7270
About 500,000 from 2135

[13-Feb-19 02:30 PM] ch6ris#5240
Thats a very nice wall.

[13-Feb-19 02:32 PM] ch6ris#5240
At least the price should remain relatively stable for awhile. Or moon.

[13-Feb-19 02:34 PM] ch6ris#5240
Must be whalebro with different buy levels.

[13-Feb-19 02:37 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If weekly closes above the green line i can say for sure that moon is coming.

Man all I keep thinking about with Komodo and these new Cc games is this daydream where it’s a few years from now and I’m playing Call of Duty on my Xbox able to bet/gamble my rounds of team death match for money (KMD). That could be big in the future. Being able to use games as betting platforms?

[13-Feb-19 02:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
That would be lit

[13-Feb-19 02:50 PM] ch6ris#5240
Gambling addiction is not "lit"

[13-Feb-19 02:50 PM] ch6ris#5240
😄

[13-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea I mean okay. Could say the same for any addiction though. Doesn’t mean it couldn’t be a good business opportunity and wouldn’t work?

[13-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Alecandro#1179
Not everyone who gambles is addicted

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] Alecandro#1179
But your point is valid

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] ch6ris#5240
Yep, that's why casino's have those huge buildings and hotels worth billions.

[13-Feb-19 02:52 PM] Alecandro#1179
🧐

[13-Feb-19 02:53 PM] ch6ris#5240
I was semi kidding. Not a fan of gambling, asfaik It's what bitcoin was mainly used for in the early days.

[13-Feb-19 02:54 PM] ch6ris#5240
I lost around 22btc back in the day. I had to block a bunch of websites to make myself think twice before ever doing it again.

[13-Feb-19 02:55 PM] ch6ris#5240
I also spent around 9k buying gta5 on steam 😛

[13-Feb-19 02:56 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yep I understand, sorry to hear that! Was just trying to say I’m excited for what these CC games could lead to for KMD! 😁

[13-Feb-19 02:57 PM] ch6ris#5240
Of course, I've invested heavily in kmdice and chips. People will suffer though.

[13-Feb-19 02:57 PM] ch6ris#5240
hopefully not me again 😄

Most activity I've seen on kmd in a long time, numbers moving all over the place.

[13-Feb-19 03:15 PM] Reel Em In#1495
currently at yesterdays resistance

[13-Feb-19 03:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
yea we bounced almost perfectly off .002 as support and now about to break previous resistance

[13-Feb-19 03:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
lets get through this time!

[13-Feb-19 03:16 PM] NNoperator#3835
three green candles

[13-Feb-19 03:18 PM] Alecandro#1179
11 BTC buy wall moved up to .0002244

[13-Feb-19 03:18 PM] NNoperator#3835
the fomo seems strong now.   Play  some  Rogue and hodl

[13-Feb-19 03:18 PM] Alecandro#1179
There’s not a ton of big sell orders either. Let’s see if we can make it through this time!

[13-Feb-19 03:24 PM] NNoperator#3835
the buy wall is being sold into some.   They are really buying.  Hopefully going into strong hands.

my bid 😛

[13-Feb-19 03:53 PM] jorian#4555
seems difficult for KMD to stay above 22500

[13-Feb-19 03:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`seems difficult for KMD to stay above 22500`
I wonder how much of that is due to unicorn fart induced delusions that BTC will 30x, thereby making much higher "overpriced" in the future of that delusion

[13-Feb-19 03:56 PM] Alecandro#1179
Did any of those big buy walls actually get bought up? Or did they just get polled down?

although, the more I think about what I just wrote, the more I realize that thought gives too much weight to the notion that most traders think about trades 🤷🏽

[13-Feb-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Alecandro history only shows a few thousand traded, so I'm thinking pulled

[13-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Alecandro#1179
Damn haha

[13-Feb-19 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, then again, 60 min volume bar is showing almost 300k...

[13-Feb-19 04:24 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea, and demand around here seems to be really high

[13-Feb-19 04:30 PM] Alecandro#1179
Whale games strong. 18btc buy wall back to .00022380. I think the whalebro/sis is among us again

You were a little hard on the mesel

[13-Feb-19 04:35 PM] Markus#5464
wow kmd-usd on bittrex, someone buys KMD for 0,85$ when price is currently 0,81$ 😄

[13-Feb-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`when price is currently 0,81$`
only if you triple trade to get to that pseudo USD
USD/BTC/KMD != USD/KMD

[13-Feb-19 04:37 PM] Markus#5464
😃

[13-Feb-19 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 
Well, one has to wonder if NXT is so great that he has vanity plates for it on his Lambo, then why is all of his "advice" nothing more than "Buy BCH!"?

[13-Feb-19 05:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
anyone know how long 120 confirmations on binance takes? lol

[13-Feb-19 05:02 PM] jansako#3330
2 hours +

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Alecandro#1179
seriously? wtf. why is it so long?

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
because 1 min blocktime

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
x 120

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] jansako#3330
+ some on top

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] Alecandro#1179
do we know why it's set so high?

[13-Feb-19 05:03 PM] linuxcaptain#2335

`only 23k`
meanwhile, "everyone" was excited to sell @ 19k not too long ago

[13-Feb-19 05:27 PM] Alecandro#1179
Haha exactly ^

[13-Feb-19 05:27 PM] Alecandro#1179
but also, mayybeee I just want to set some orders higher.....

[13-Feb-19 05:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, 100k is good

[13-Feb-19 05:33 PM] Alexfrog#1338
to set them

[13-Feb-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
didnt somebody guarantee it would come back down to 17k or 18k?

{Reactions}
😦 

[13-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Markus#5464
binance should add dpow deposit check so we dont have to wait 120 confirmations

[13-Feb-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we will be testing a new version of dpowconfs that has a decent chance for working with binance. the trick we used required no changes for most exchanges to utilize. that is how we got so many exchanges using it

[13-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Markus#5464
thats nice 😄

[13-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Alecandro#1179
that would be awesome

[13-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Alecandro#1179
I mean we could still be stuck in the accumulation channel right?

[13-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Alecandro#1179
could potentially get rejected again still?

[13-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
well were over bought now so expect a small pullback i would say

[13-Feb-19 05:47 PM] Markus#5464
unless whale keeps it up here for some days so rsi can adjust

[13-Feb-19 05:48 PM] Markus#5464
but time will tell 😄

[13-Feb-19 05:51 PM] NNoperator#3835
another volume spurt  300k traded this hour

[13-Feb-19 05:53 PM] NNoperator#3835
Are we going to test 25k again?  This time with authority?

[13-Feb-19 05:53 PM] Alecandro#1179
I hope so

[13-Feb-19 05:53 PM] Alecandro#1179
If we break it, we have open space to about 33k

[13-Feb-19 05:58 PM] dxer666#8963
@Alecandro  25k?

[13-Feb-19 05:58 PM] Alecandro#1179
I believe so

[13-Feb-19 05:59 PM] Alecandro#1179
We've been stuck under 25k since July of 18
