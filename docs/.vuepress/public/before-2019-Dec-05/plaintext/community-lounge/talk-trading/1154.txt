Tek is like a younger, religious version of Gary Busey (the post motorcycle crash Busey, when he really lost his filters).

[23-Sep-19 07:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
Jesus Busey, Gary's separated at birth identical twin.

wtf

[23-Sep-19 10:10 PM] Neko#5830
LTC is redundant and always will be

[23-Sep-19 10:17 PM] Markus#5464
Not sure alts bottomed out yet tbh

[23-Sep-19 10:48 PM] Sdunbar#5064
bottom is roughly 0 cents each

[23-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Sdunbar#5064
It's a weird world

[23-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Sdunbar#5064
in parts of africa people are just trying to get enough food to survive another day

[23-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Sdunbar#5064
the western world, buying stuff that has zero substance hoping some other asshole will buy if off you for more later

[23-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Sdunbar#5064
and the elite? Trying to accumulate everything and leave everyone else with nothing

[23-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Sdunbar#5064
mad world indeed

[23-Sep-19 11:48 PM] JimD#9272
There is really no need to compare ourselves to Africans

[23-Sep-19 11:49 PM] JimD#9272
They need to git gud or STFU

[23-Sep-19 11:53 PM] Neko#5830
Ethiopia has 100 million habitants let that sink in

[23-Sep-19 11:54 PM] JimD#9272
Africa is terrifying TBH.  Every single one of those fuckers is gonna try and come to US/Europe within the next 30 years

[23-Sep-19 11:55 PM] Neko#5830
they want to downgrade the standard of living everywhere so only the elites will live like kings in closed city-states while the rest of us are left to fight the hordes

[23-Sep-19 11:56 PM] JimD#9272
Yup, and we are gonna lose.  They are gonna take the guns then use the media to direct the retarded masses at "white supremacists"

[23-Sep-19 11:57 PM] JimD#9272
Better learn guerrilla warfare whiteboi

[23-Sep-19 11:57 PM] Neko#5830
its disheartening to watch it all happening in slow-mo

[23-Sep-19 11:58 PM] JimD#9272
Yup, we can take these fuckers out better than 10:1 if we organize but the US government needs to go broke first

[23-Sep-19 11:58 PM] JimD#9272
can't organize when intelligence agencies will subvert 24/7 and get paid well to do it

[23-Sep-19 11:58 PM] JimD#9272
in short, paying taxes is feeding your adversaries

[23-Sep-19 11:59 PM] Neko#5830
yup they ensured the president and elected doofus are just a cardboard cutout while the real government never changes

[24-Sep-19 12:00 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, I would hope more people would realize that after the Trump vs Dems/Deep start circus but they can't see whats in front of them

[24-Sep-19 12:00 AM] JimD#9272
Even Trump is pretty controlled.  If he stops sucking dick to Israel he is done

[24-Sep-19 12:01 AM] Neko#5830
yeah its getting ridiculous

[24-Sep-19 12:01 AM] Neko#5830
because its so obvious at this point

[24-Sep-19 12:01 AM] Neko#5830
i will watch it all burn but i`ll be prepared

[24-Sep-19 12:02 AM] JimD#9272
Its obvious to us but its taken me a while to sort the real conspiracies from the fake

[24-Sep-19 12:02 AM] JimD#9272
so I imagine most normies don't have the discipline to the will

[24-Sep-19 12:02 AM] Neko#5830
true.

[24-Sep-19 12:03 AM] JimD#9272
But your right, wait for the fall.  It won't be surprise to us

Half of all Americans Wonâ€™t Survive 2 Weeks without Electricity
A new study shows that 50% of Americans wouldn't survive for more than two weeks without power, and an astonishing 75% of them said they would be dead within two months.

[24-Sep-19 12:03 AM] JimD#9272
It can happen fast too

[24-Sep-19 12:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
civilization is just a thin veneer over what is a carefully controlled feeding frenzy. if the power shuts off and the trucks stop running, It would be mad max in a matter of months.

[24-Sep-19 12:07 AM] Neko#5830
gotta have plan B , always

[24-Sep-19 12:07 AM] Neko#5830
at least we won't die of boredoom

[24-Sep-19 12:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm slightly prepared. but I hope it never happens

[24-Sep-19 12:09 AM] JimD#9272
Im torn.  Letting the status quo continue is default commie victory

[24-Sep-19 12:10 AM] JimD#9272
but I guess things would be easier to just sit back and let it happen

[24-Sep-19 12:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
well anyone who prepares and organizes a group is instantly put in a govt database and labeled various ridiculous things

[24-Sep-19 12:11 AM] JimD#9272
Yup, and Americans still think they are free

[24-Sep-19 12:12 AM] JimD#9272
They just installed 20 security cameras where I work and put up no gun stickers

[24-Sep-19 12:12 AM] JimD#9272
But god-forbid any of us conceal and carry

[24-Sep-19 12:12 AM] JimD#9272
its against HR policy

[24-Sep-19 12:12 AM] actionslacks#4072
perhap some of the tools being built here will allow communities to grow and communicate without fear of reprisal.

[24-Sep-19 12:13 AM] JimD#9272
Thats a hope too.  Im sure a town could function on nothing but crypto assets

[24-Sep-19 12:13 AM] JimD#9272
so many possibilities for the tech

[24-Sep-19 12:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
they can double down on taking the guns and lose another election if they want. of course it's all just different flavors of communism anyway. central banks are as about as commie as you can get.

[24-Sep-19 12:16 AM] JimD#9272
Yup, it was sad watching Ron Paul getting cheated in the primaries

[24-Sep-19 12:16 AM] JimD#9272
No Austrian economics for Murca

[24-Sep-19 12:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
the next crash might be crypto's watershed moment. hopefully the next revolution can be bloodless.

[24-Sep-19 12:19 AM] JimD#9272
We shall see, the 1st American revolution certainly wasn't

[24-Sep-19 12:20 AM] JimD#9272
It will be interesting if the government goes full authoritarian or states start succeeding and re-establishing perimeters

[24-Sep-19 12:20 AM] JimD#9272
I really have no idea how it could play out

[24-Sep-19 12:20 AM] JimD#9272
I read a USA Today article about how the national debt is no big deal

Will America's massive debt really doom us?
In Manhattan, a giant clock displays a rising U.S. debt total â€” almost $23 trillion for now. Pundits say it's big trouble.  But is it?

[24-Sep-19 12:21 AM] JimD#9272
apparently this is fine

[24-Sep-19 12:21 AM] JimD#9272
and if you count the assets we bought with our debt we are only 16 trillion in debt

[24-Sep-19 12:23 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's a great family business. for a few families.

[24-Sep-19 12:23 AM] JimD#9272
Indeed ðŸ˜‰

[24-Sep-19 12:27 AM] Neko#5830
its made in a way it will only truly collapse when they want

[24-Sep-19 12:29 AM] JimD#9272
Well most agriculture relies on oil.  So if there was a big global conflict and the middle east/Russia/US refining capacity got leveled there would be mass starvation in no time

[24-Sep-19 12:30 AM] JimD#9272
but who is to say an event like that would not be staged

[24-Sep-19 12:30 AM] JimD#9272
I think this world is more fragile than it appears

[24-Sep-19 12:38 AM] actionslacks#4072
considering how crazy things are getting already, I wouldn't rule anything out. the slow yet methodical push to move everyone off of the land and into dense population centers should make population control a little easier. the personal tracking devices have been distributed. seems like some things are falling into place. going cashless will be the next big step I think. Probably why privacy coins are such a big no no now.

[24-Sep-19 12:39 AM] JimD#9272
Do you think they can actually stop privacy coins though?

[24-Sep-19 12:40 AM] JimD#9272
Sure they can kill the demand banning them on CEX exchanges but they can't stop us from just dexing them around to each other

[24-Sep-19 12:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Just kill the price that's more than enough to kill the vast majority of the interest in it

[24-Sep-19 12:41 AM] Sdunbar#5064
dont need to fully kill the coin

[24-Sep-19 12:42 AM] Sdunbar#5064
just make sure only like 0.05% of the population is using it that's more than good enough

[24-Sep-19 12:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
crushing the price of a project like arrr would be like a side hobby for people who can manipulate the price of gold.

[24-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
arrr on the KMD ecosystem ?

[24-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
Monero/PIVX/DAPS are the only privacy coins I keep an eye on

[24-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
Monero is still doing quite well though

[24-Sep-19 12:43 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, or even zcash, it's been on a downward slope for months

[24-Sep-19 12:44 AM] JimD#9272
I wonder if DEX will ever be strong enough to cut out centralized exchanges though

[24-Sep-19 12:44 AM] JimD#9272
I know the long term vision is to obsolete CEX with DEX

[24-Sep-19 12:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think the benefits of btc are appreciated, that why theres this whole btc maximalist trope going on now. It's been approved. but price will be controlled

[24-Sep-19 12:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
the dex will only grow with time. how much and how fast is really hard to guess

[24-Sep-19 12:46 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, another reason I like KMD though.

[24-Sep-19 12:46 AM] JimD#9272
Leading the charge on DEX/atomic swaps

[24-Sep-19 12:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
well it may not even be kmd that benefits the most from the tech. It helps everyone in crypto.

[24-Sep-19 12:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
crypto veterans get it right away. newcomers a little less so

[24-Sep-19 12:48 AM] JimD#9272
I think the mobile dex is gonna do wonders to fix that issue though

[24-Sep-19 12:49 AM] JimD#9272
Can they get fiat onramps for DEX yet ?

[24-Sep-19 12:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's in the works on multiple fronts through multiple kmd ecosystem participants

[24-Sep-19 12:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
but coinbase sells usdc, which is compatible with the mobile dex already

[24-Sep-19 12:50 AM] JimD#9272
Thats probably the magic ticket TBH

[24-Sep-19 12:50 AM] JimD#9272
Coinbase is super centralized and monitored though

[24-Sep-19 12:50 AM] JimD#9272
and they charge like 3% to buy BTC

[24-Sep-19 12:50 AM] JimD#9272
its pretty expensive

[24-Sep-19 12:51 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah well unlike binance, they havent asked for my social security # yet

{Reactions}
ðŸ˜‚ 

[24-Sep-19 12:52 AM] JimD#9272
would be great just to link my bank account and transfer the funds over

[24-Sep-19 12:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
wells fargo shut down my coinbase account link, then announced their issuing a stable coin. I think that may be an antitrust vioiation honestly

[24-Sep-19 12:54 AM] JimD#9272
Ouch, I have USAA and they seem of of embraced crypto thus far

[24-Sep-19 12:54 AM] JimD#9272
I can link my account with my coinbase account

[24-Sep-19 12:55 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah my local bank is fine with it too. I wasn't suprised when it happened
