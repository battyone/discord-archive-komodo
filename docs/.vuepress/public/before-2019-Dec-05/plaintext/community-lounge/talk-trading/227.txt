It is constantly happening on a daily basis.

[17-Oct-18 03:24 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Did you know that for most of the people I have worked with on Pirate, they are fine accepting KMD?  Only one person has asked for BTC instead.

[17-Oct-18 03:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There are developments and work being done by almost all the developers across "party" lines to make sure projects are stronger and better through collaboration.  It's pretty neat to see.

[17-Oct-18 03:26 PM] dan.#2473
sooner or later fundamentals win, this might not be it, but even in crypto land, it'll happen

[17-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Today my brother told me that he thinks DEX/SuperNET are actually taking away value from KMD. I told him it's actually the opposite as people wanting to buy those assets usually buy them in kmd, and these assets also payout the dividends in kmd, generating more demand for kmd

[17-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It's small things like that that people need to learn/know about to draw them in more

[17-Oct-18 03:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And little by little people will start understanding the ecosystem and see the true value

[17-Oct-18 03:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@Cryptoon thanks, it works BITTREX:KMDBTC/2+BINANCE:KMDBTC/2 or (BITTREX:KMDBTC+BINANCE:KMDBTC)/2 unfortunately it won't load data pre binance start though :L was kinda hoping to get both histories too

[17-Oct-18 03:28 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
because bittrex has data since ico start

[17-Oct-18 03:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I could only load the daily chart though, for hourly you needed pro features

[17-Oct-18 03:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And I am but a simple man

[17-Oct-18 03:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not pro 😦

[17-Oct-18 03:30 PM] dan.#2473
i think its pretty safe to say with 1 leg in, the whale is committing the rest of his btc

[17-Oct-18 03:30 PM] dan.#2473
i expect at least a lil more bump

[17-Oct-18 03:30 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
also, it's just what we see, he could have bougth OTC for another 1000 btc

[17-Oct-18 03:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
anyone already calculated how much he looses in KMD interest every day by letting it sit on the exchange ^^?

[17-Oct-18 03:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
200K BTC buyer back at 20K sats

[17-Oct-18 03:31 PM] dan.#2473
but, not sure if a rally will actually happen, might not be enough to instill fomo

[17-Oct-18 03:32 PM] dan.#2473
69 kmd a day @ 500k kmd

Crypto is *not* just a tech play. There are network effects, Schelling points and social coordination that weigh much more heavily. https://t.co/ndjWkPy2o4

[17-Oct-18 03:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The network for KMD keeps growing with each new project.

[17-Oct-18 03:33 PM] dan.#2473
its just like any other business. adding social networking, website, google business, helps create a network effect of value and = success

[17-Oct-18 03:33 PM] dan.#2473
when i did apps, every little thing i did got me more downloads

[17-Oct-18 03:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We've got a video on ours coming out that is just free press for KMD basically.   Showing off awesome capabilities are useful and engaging for people wanting to learn about the project. 

@dan. The team on KMD certainly does.   They have a big product and task on their hands.

[17-Oct-18 03:34 PM] dan.#2473
outside of the apps themselves

[17-Oct-18 03:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so @Geocold51 never came back?

[17-Oct-18 03:34 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We've seen discord numbers jump by 10% since we started too... each little piece just adds to the network.  
It's a strong solid network too.  Not a flimsy one.

This is probably a good time to remind everyone that 0x is a highly experimental technology that is built on top of another piece of highly experimental technology.

its good they have you on board, you were a missing piece in the puzzle tbh.. but just my opinion

[17-Oct-18 03:35 PM] FishyGuts#5085
KMD privacy tech is wonderful.   We are glad to have had the community start a chain to showcase it.

[17-Oct-18 03:40 PM] snowdamn#2414
with KMD, set 2 price goals for the strategy below:
accumulate enough KMD that would ensure retirement when selling 38.2% @ 1st price goal and that the 5% APR on the 61.8% remaining will translate to more fuck you money than you'll ever need @ 2nd price goal 
in reality, meeting 1st price goal is all that matters if you can accumulate 😉

[17-Oct-18 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Are those price or amount of kmd goals? :p

[17-Oct-18 03:43 PM] dan.#2473
the rewards work for quite a few more years anyways

[17-Oct-18 03:44 PM] dan.#2473
cant believe theres only 9 btc on sell side on binance atm

[17-Oct-18 03:47 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
9btc?! nice lol 1kmd - 1btc coming sooner than we thought

[17-Oct-18 03:47 PM] snowdamn#2414
@Cryptoon need to set amounts that will achieve the strategy's goals at those prices...  😂

[17-Oct-18 03:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hahaha

[17-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
That whale will make so much money from the reward on a weekly basis when KMD hits $100 that others knowing will cause fomo.

can barterdex be brought down / DOS-attacked?

any single netid could, but seems 14000 netids would be hard to kill all at once

[17-Oct-18 05:20 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I am tech noob, thanks @jl777c did some googlin as well. In laymen terms barterdex acts like a torrent client right? info is shared in a peer to peer fashion. So while you could bring down one node, the barterdexclient itself does not have  a main host. rather multiple small connections from all the users between each other.

[17-Oct-18 05:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I dont see why it would matter too much. If u use binance they know ur chicken. So they can see what comes in and out.

[17-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it comes in

[17-Oct-18 05:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it goes out

[17-Oct-18 07:19 PM] BlockTech#6895
@Tek he just removed it, but was "only" 170BTC remaining. (I'm pretty sure he is just waiting for the market to go a bit down and will put his wall again around 18k)

[17-Oct-18 07:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
need to login with same passphrase you used when you deposited

[17-Oct-18 07:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
when you do you'll see same address

[17-Oct-18 07:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@groundhog 👆🏼 If you use the same passphrase you'll never get a different address
