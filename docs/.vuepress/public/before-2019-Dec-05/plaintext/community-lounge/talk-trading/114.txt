You know you can get a house for fuck all in Aus still? Its a really big place, get out of the city and theres plenty of cheap land.

[25-Aug-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
paid less than 200k for my place, but its a 250KM drive to city, so you have fuck all services, theres places closer though that are even cheaper.

Nah i think were both pretty into the whole city life LOL. Wish i grew up in the countryside sometimes but cant see ourselves taking the move. Around my state 500 600k can get a decent place so not too bad, but anywhere better would be 1m + which is a bit over budget for a first house

This is not the market I would be buying into personally... I even paid too much for this place... Should have offered 20k less and refused to go higher, still would have got it. It had been on the market for a long time. One of the oldest houses in the town, none of the floors are even level. 😂

[25-Aug-18 05:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I got this place for its location only, before the NBN moving any further up the hill would have meant the intenret was half the speed 😄

[25-Aug-18 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And I have no neighbours in the middle of the town, which is nice. Both houses next to me, are owned by shire and a company, so they only have people in them sometimes.

[25-Aug-18 05:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The only reason I even bought in this operpriced market is that rent out here is 20-30% more than a mortgage min repayment.

if KMD goes to $1000, we would have a few thousand millionaires in our ecosystem easy 😄

[25-Aug-18 05:50 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

yay! I have been to Blockshow ... _again_ Las Vegas this time... insane place- worst of all, the morons crank up the air conditioning to freezing- so there is 45C outside, and 17 or 18C inside.

@jl777c you mentioned after  Blockshow Europe  in Berlin that you were there too- joking, or were you really there? I missed to ask back then.. 📜

[25-Aug-18 01:35 PM] LocoMB#8593
besides, the fake Venice they plastered into that concrete structure is highly repelling- not least because of those arctic temperatures, but also because of the fact that there is no natural light at all, and the acoustics sound more like the inside of a factory because of all the hard surfaces, not like an organic place at all. Not to mention the silly prices for the crap they peddle there

[25-Aug-18 01:36 PM] LocoMB#8593
But Blockshow was great fun again! 🎰 💫

Hey guys, I'm new to KMD and really love the idea and see a huge future. I am ready to invest in the next couple of days. Only question I have is: How do I buy $ 1 million worth of KMD without having to deal with banks or exchanges? I will have it cash and ready soon. I breath blockchain and decentralization, already have agama app.

Don’t buy 1 mil worth in one go. Buy BTC first. Better chances of getting OTC BTC for cash. Use BTC to buy KMD
