@Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI the btc chart has more volume and that will give you the most accurate PA, also depends on if you are trying to accumulate sats  for a potential bull run on btc or going for usd

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Lanii#8302
in my experience your better off trading btc charts then usdt ones

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Lanii#8302
specially on illiquid alts

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464
volume have not dried up is a good sign meanwhile price is not rly doing much

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i only trade usdt charts personally

[30-Oct-19 04:20 PM] Lanii#8302
ok

[30-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Lanii#8302
@Markus sry, would have to disagree there, avg 20-30 btc volume a day seems pretty meh

[30-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i just made a 90% return on tron but i got rid of it

[30-Oct-19 04:21 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i will buy it when it comes to papi

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
komodo i dont get rid of

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Bottom line is ppl dont buy KMD at the moment which is sad. On the other hand: other coins are making runs now out of nowhere and those charts looked dead too until that moment

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
@Lanii idk if u remember but we had times a while ago when kmd had 300k usd volume

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
so 2-3 mil now is a improvement

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Lanii#8302
hm

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Lanii#8302
you are getting this data from coinmarketcap

[30-Oct-19 04:22 PM] Lanii#8302
total volume on kmd on all exchanges?

[30-Oct-19 04:23 PM] Markus#5464
i dont think exchanges that are not listed on CmC have that great daily volume to change much üòõ

[30-Oct-19 04:23 PM] Flint#6435
Of course, accumulation is coming! just in the process of accumulation sometimes weak hands go away and we see false breakdowns! but in general, the consolidation is excellent and clearly visible in intraday trading volumes! and the whales will continue to want to settle in our heads the idea that the chest of drawers will fall even lower and force them to sell! NO! personally, Im fundamentally not selling a single coin, no matter how painful it is to look at the candles

[30-Oct-19 04:24 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
the usd chart is pointing to 2 usd based on this high and low

@CoinKing88 I tend to belive that if you are in a price discovery zone you're way better of buying some sort of a higher low then trying to blindly knife catch a possible bottom

[30-Oct-19 04:24 PM] Flint#6435
volumes everywhere fake

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Flint#6435
@Lanii  Youre absolutely right!

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Lanii#8302
Im simply gonna play this scenario

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Lanii#8302
if this was to be the bottom

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Lanii#8302
Im missing on 30% gains

[30-Oct-19 04:26 PM] Lanii#8302
but who cares if we really get an alt season

[30-Oct-19 04:27 PM] Flint#6435
The price is ALREADY good for entry for a period of six months or more

[30-Oct-19 04:27 PM] Lanii#8302
however trying to catch bottoms for 1.5 years straight, you have no more money left to buy with

[30-Oct-19 04:28 PM] Lanii#8302
Until the scenario above happens you are literally in a bearish trend for hella long time and I see absolutelty nothing bullish about it whatsoever

[30-Oct-19 04:28 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
@Lanii yes there is the first line of resistance

755 sats

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
not the way I trade

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
it is a resistence

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
but not the first one

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
640 ish will provide me a good entry with good sl

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
first major resistance yu think the volume bar lies ?

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
bro

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
if u have 15 indicators on ur chart

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
then ur a pleb

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
simple as that

[30-Oct-19 04:29 PM] Lanii#8302
lmao

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
thats a true volume bar lets call it A

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Lanii#8302
I cant see what the hell is going on with price

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Lanii#8302
because its stuffed with a lot of other stuff on it

[30-Oct-19 04:30 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
i cbf debating

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Lanii#8302
ok

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Lanii#8302
but the question "you think this volume bar is lying" is just pleb

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Lanii#8302
just because you trade of different indicators doesnt make it the only accurate way to trade

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
yu keep an eye on it ok üòâ

[30-Oct-19 04:31 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
leave it at that

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Markus#5464
I mean its great to see some activity in this channel that is actually trading related for once üòõ

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Lanii#8302
if your resistence is at 740 and I say its not the "first one"

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Lanii#8302
then idc if your volume bar or ur meme indicators are showing something else

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Flint#6435
but consolidation and a side trend cannot last forever; the longer the side trend lasts, the higher the asset then grows - this is an elementary rule of redistributing capital from the most volatile assets with changing trends to the most stable, and if we compare with others we can be called stable - after all, we dont We leave below $ 0.5 and probably will not leave because weak hands have left most Komodo

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Lanii#8302
but stuffing a chart with bunch of indicators tells me you have no clue of what simple trend in price action is, simple as that

[30-Oct-19 04:32 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
my chart is not stuffed with indicators

[30-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500

[30-Oct-19 04:33 PM] Markus#5464

[30-Oct-19 04:37 PM] Lanii#8302

[30-Oct-19 04:38 PM] Lanii#8302

possible combinations

[30-Oct-19 04:39 PM] Lanii#8302
you can break it down in 100 steps but matter of fact is thats our last low before we broke down to new lows, anyone who has done TA for more then a month has heard of the term S/R R/S flip

[30-Oct-19 04:40 PM] Lanii#8302
and untill we can get above that there is no point of talking about resistences higher up

[30-Oct-19 04:41 PM] Mooch_IM YOUR PAPI#8500
as yu wish üòâ
