insiders had too much liquidity to offer, plus allowing OTC to flip on the IEO buyers, and this is before the 50 million mined VBK is allowed to be deposited, not sure what percentage of the mined coins were by the vbk team, i estimate at least half

[08-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so it seems they extracted their $30 mil in BTC, net of operations costs still clears at least $5 million. not bad for a closed source spam machine

[08-Apr-19 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
unless they bought the IEO themselves

[08-Apr-19 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
to make it look like a success

[08-Apr-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case, the OTC buyers are the patsies

[08-Apr-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, on a separate topic, WTB 40 BTC worth of KMD

imo, 1 of the reasons why bittrex IEO doesn't "moon" like other IEO on Binance or Huobi is because they don't have their own tokens, this is just my theory :
1) prior to the IEO annoucement, exchanges create buy orders and slowly buy their own tokens.
2) annouce the IEO, which will likely be buyable with their exchanges tokens (like Binance bnb or Huobi HT), the market will likely react to this and pump their tokens.
3) Slowly sell the tokens bought at step 1 to take the profit, and use this profit to create buy orders on IEO after listing it , this could help to keep the price above IEO price , also create good momentum for the next IEO.

My favorite part about the Bittrex IEO was those influencers and larger accounts who likely had access to the presale, were on Twitter the last 5 days trying to sell their bags at market price, which to them was still a solid 5-10x

Same people ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù the ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù possibilities the project is going to provide when it becomes ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù.

You know a year  ago I would have listened but I know better now.

they need to keep the deposits closed long enough for all the insiders and OTC buyers to cashout. real price is below 50% the IEO price: https://bitmesh.com/exchange?market=btc_vbk#/

protip: don't ICO a coin with tonnes of coins already in circulation

[08-Apr-19 04:12 PM] Alright#0419
the year or so I've been here, any time I've seen that happen it just miserably fails

[08-Apr-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but the coins in circulation dont matter if deposits are closed

[08-Apr-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
only insiders and bulk buyers using the bittrex OTC service had coins to sell

[08-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Post#7345
otc buyers had some nice gains - the IEO buyers which didnt get out at the start not such much

[08-Apr-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what was the otc price?

[08-Apr-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be the thing that really messed things up

[08-Apr-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
disabling deposits was a brilliant move to isolate the trading to just the IEO coins and not the mined ones

[08-Apr-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems the otc sell side ended up overpowering the buy side

[08-Apr-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
what minimum volume? so half price, of IEO at the same time as the IEO from the same place?

[08-Apr-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so 1250 is the floor, at least a floor based on cost basis

[08-Apr-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the ones that flipped at the 4000+ sats during first hours must be very happy

[08-Apr-19 04:31 PM] Post#7345
im not to sure at the 12 mil - but it was said in their telegram and half of those coins were available at trading start, so...yeah

[08-Apr-19 04:32 PM] jl777c#5810
is it just me or was this designed to be a way to suck money from the IEO newbs?

[08-Apr-19 04:34 PM] Post#7345
you don¬¥t even want to know how "mad" the people are in their telegram (and were in their discord, but they banned everyone, so its a little silent there now)

[08-Apr-19 04:34 PM] jl777c#5810
half locked, but if you sold at 3x the price, you are still ahead and maybe the other half has some residual value, though looking at the 500,000 VBK /day mining output, when miners are able to deposit it seems hard to imagine a price higher than 1000 sats being supported. of course, the initial dump from the 50million mined who saw big profits for the few hours and now are seeing bigger and bigger losses by the day.... the panic sell will likely be quite severe, but then again maybe most of those coins were mined by the team

[08-Apr-19 04:36 PM] Post#7345
some got sold in bitmesh over these days, but its basically a a drop in the ocean, as the volume is quite low

[08-Apr-19 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810

They also had $0.01 sales to prequaled investors I believe.

[08-Apr-19 04:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would have to research to find that tidbit but honestly, IDGAF about them enough to care.   Even at $0.05 it's still bad company.

so they open source utilities and rpc tools to say they opened the source code, but keep the daemon code closed?
