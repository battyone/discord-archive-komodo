[19-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 09:19 PM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 09:20 PM] nael55#5863
the pigs fed veg diets can still get parasites. not sure if this is true in pigs, but people freeze fish to kill parasites

Stats are reassuring though

[19-Jun-19 09:25 PM] Bittersweet#9376

[19-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Tek#5253

[19-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Tek#5253
but its the most scary thing you can catch from eating meat I guess

[19-Jun-19 09:26 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

if you fuck an infected hooker the chance you get it isn't very big if you are healthy

[19-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253
but if you are infected and fuck a hooker no condo the chance she gets it is like 100x

[19-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Tek#5253
cant remember where I got this

[19-Jun-19 09:31 PM] Bittersweet#9376
what does 100x chance mean

[19-Jun-19 09:32 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That's what she said...

[19-Jun-19 09:32 PM] Tek#5253
i mean women are 100x more likely to get infected with sexual transmittable disease

[19-Jun-19 09:32 PM] Tek#5253
