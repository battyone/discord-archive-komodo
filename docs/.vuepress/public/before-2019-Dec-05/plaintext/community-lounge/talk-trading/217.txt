[16-Oct-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
seems there is very little sell volume at these prices, almost as if the entire orderbook is some bot created fiction to lower prices

[16-Oct-18 09:32 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the wall is now 19000

[16-Oct-18 09:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
So he is moving the wall but not actually buying something?

[16-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c i've been suspecting that for a while now

[16-Oct-18 09:34 AM] Tek#5253
bots that operate to gain market share, not profit , they don't care about cost

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
i wonder if it will be hit

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] Tek#5253
his wall

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's better to have higher price because of usage though , than just hodlers

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly if the real marketprice was 16 to 18k sats and there is this big wall, it will be sold into

[16-Oct-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but the entire orderbook just shifts around the buywall, wherever it is

[16-Oct-18 09:36 AM] Tek#5253
yeah agreed

[16-Oct-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so there appears to be a totally fabricated buyside and sell side

[16-Oct-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
which means the real unmanipulated price for KMD could be a very far distance from where it is now

[16-Oct-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
until we see orders flowing into the buywall, we are well below the true market price and this crazy low price is a manipulation

[16-Oct-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
likely ALL altcoins are manipulated this way

yep

[16-Oct-18 09:37 AM] Tek#5253
i have th esame feel

[16-Oct-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and that explains how things can double in a day!!

[16-Oct-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is because it was suppressed to 50% of the actual price

[16-Oct-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
or 25% or whatever these mirage bots are able to do

[16-Oct-18 09:38 AM] Tek#5253
I think they just push the price down as far as possible to make the weak hands sell. into their orders

[16-Oct-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[16-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
that always pop up first or jump infront of real human orders

[16-Oct-18 09:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
so the 350btc is just a giant bat being used to beat the price back down?

[16-Oct-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it appears to be a new player that is exposing the lies that are the depressed orderbooks

[16-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
he's been around a few times

[16-Oct-18 09:39 AM] Tek#5253
the few 3 months

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
there were big huge buy walls like this for KMD pushing up the price regularly

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
it came around when this one big whale silk road tied guy

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
started moving coins

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
he started buying XMR and KMD

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
or tries to

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
well that wall got eaten up eventually

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] Tek#5253
I think

[16-Oct-18 09:40 AM] jorian#4555
at well above 20k sats

[16-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
well its only 300 bitcoins

[16-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
this whale has like 100k bitcoins

[16-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
that he still needs to get clean...

[16-Oct-18 09:41 AM] Tek#5253
so privacy coins is what hes getting mostly

[16-Oct-18 09:41 AM] CHMEX#0686

[16-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
then he should use pirate üòÑ

[16-Oct-18 09:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
That what he needs

[16-Oct-18 09:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
in addition üòÉ So James was right somebody might wants to buy KMD to buy PIRATE

[16-Oct-18 09:43 AM] Tek#5253
cool

[16-Oct-18 09:44 AM] dxer666#8963
@CHMEX  why buy Pirate?

[16-Oct-18 09:45 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
completely anonymous transaction , for more info https://pirate.black/

- Pirate Chain (ARRR)
INTRO PIRATE is the best of Zcash (ZEC) combined with the best of Monero (XMR). It‚Äôs a forced Shielded-transactions (z-transactions) only blockchain, meant for completely anonymous transactions. PIRATE is mined into a transparent address, but can only go into a shielded add...

[16-Oct-18 09:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
its more private than XMR
and more private than KMD as if does not allow transparent transactions by default

[16-Oct-18 09:46 AM] CHMEX#0686
by default I mean by the normal user.
People can not leak much info unless they post it someplace and even with that you can't verify

[16-Oct-18 09:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
check it out #deleted-channel  #pirate  pirate.black

[16-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and even if they do, the info about the other party is still protected

[16-Oct-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
just a simple example. if you send taddr funds to someone else, now they know your direct balance and can usually correlate any other addresses you use connected to that address

[16-Oct-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE all they know is that you were able to pay them what you paid them

[16-Oct-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
no info about what else you have

[16-Oct-18 09:51 AM] Mark81#4505
I dont buy into theory of bying kmd to buy pirate. At least with over 300btc.

[16-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jorian#4555
heh. if 300 btc was moving into pirate, the pirate price would be a bit higher

[16-Oct-18 09:52 AM] jorian#4555
we're saying that if the 300btc whale is buying privacy coins because of silk road stuff, he needs to buy pirate. we're not saying that that is the case right now

[16-Oct-18 09:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
but a silk road guy on a cex I don't know

[16-Oct-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah that makes it doubtful

350BTC/2BTC only 175 days

[16-Oct-18 10:00 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
conspiracy theory: coinbase plans to list KMD, therefore they are buying it ahead of time üòÑ

[16-Oct-18 10:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586

@hyperDEX uptrend is confirmed with sustained price action above weekly 20sma

[16-Oct-18 10:05 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Will show graph when i get home

[16-Oct-18 10:21 AM] Mark81#4505
We need to get price to ATH so people will start buying this!

[16-Oct-18 10:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
With the whale that is accumulating like it is. Im not worried

@aCryptoConsult @Baidu_Inc @justinsuntron I would laugh if it is just some blockchain initiative kinda like the "Microsoft/AWS partnerships" from last year.

Knowing Justin, it probably is.

1/ ODaily: The 'partnership' between Baidu and Tron is basically about Tron buying cloud computing resources from Baidu. "The two parties have made no contact at the blockchain business level".

We finally were able to close above weekly 8ema, but we still need to close above 20sma and stay there.

[16-Oct-18 11:30 AM] dokrates#8987
what will happen if kmd goes over 20k?

[16-Oct-18 11:30 AM] dokrates#8987
lot of volume in past 3 days

what price is the 20sma? i cant read it

[16-Oct-18 11:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like we need 30k to clear everything

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
how many people think here that someone might be buying KMD to buy PIRATE ? ü§î

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see it a very slim chance

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
PIRATE isn't yet very known

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anywhere

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Well I still have some moves to make to recover my KMD stash back to previous levels

[16-Oct-18 11:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
except somehow in KMD community and in Miners

[16-Oct-18 11:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Don‚Äôt moon it yet bruh

[16-Oct-18 11:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verus and pirate were KMD expensive

[16-Oct-18 11:37 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Already underwater KMD-wise on pirate :abusedsmily:

[16-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verus not so much

Can you move your 320BTC wall up to 30k @Hollowman9000

@jl777c 20sma in weekly chart is at about 0.000207

[16-Oct-18 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
_wishes his liquid assets were worth a fraction of what some people think they are_

[16-Oct-18 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
best case scenario is for faster moving averages to move above slower moving averages

[16-Oct-18 11:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then we can call the close on top of the 20sma as "sustained"
