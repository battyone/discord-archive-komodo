Is there an OTC market for kmd if you wanna buy a big amount ?

[15-Feb-19 09:36 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I know it sounds silly with all the cex  and etc but some people are still very old fashioned and prefer to buy it via OTC

[16-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Likewise#6767
well, what has the last pump taught us? That we have indeed made no progress. Volume drying up again and price back to where we came from. Some progress @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[16-Feb-19 02:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If that's what the last pump taught you then I fear for your future in this ecosystem.

[16-Feb-19 02:16 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have no idea what the last pump taught me.  I wasn't looking for lessons in price action 😛

[16-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Likewise#6767
no not to fear for mine 😉

[16-Feb-19 02:17 AM] Likewise#6767
what has the past pump shown us? That we have not broken any highs, no sustained bull trend is occured. Just another ordinary pump. Dont talk hopium into yourself, trade the price.

[16-Feb-19 02:30 AM] Markus#5464
well it looks like price should atleast stay around 20k sats this time, if we check previous fib lvls it "bottomed out" around 17,5. If we do similar check now then it says 19,85. And atm we can see that price is not rly changing around 20.5ish

[16-Feb-19 02:34 AM] Likewise#6767
20 k sats should hold. Look at the volume though, hence why I keep caling it ordinary pumps. from 38 BTC to 750 BTC sell off starts back to 150 BTC, soon we wwill below 10 btc again. hence this is not a sustained run, nothing has really changed, same old ordinary pumps. No sustained trend.

[16-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Likewise#6767
below 100 BTC I emant

[16-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Markus#5464
yea well atleast we "bottom" higher and higher hopefully thats always something to make our bags look prettier 😄

[16-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Likewise#6767
a slitter of hope 😃

[16-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Markus#5464
Atleast a begin, im sure when the custom blockchain generator comes out on amazon marketplace, rebrand coming and market increasses then we can see a bigger rally

[16-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Markus#5464
until then we will have to live with those pumps now and then ^^

[16-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Likewise#6767
I think so too, what we really need here is the exposure to the Korean market. Are the Koreans buying KMD yet?

[16-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Likewise#6767
marketing?

[16-Feb-19 02:39 AM] Markus#5464
well koreans buy kmd on upbit

[16-Feb-19 02:39 AM] Markus#5464
mostly on kmd/krw pair

[16-Feb-19 02:39 AM] Likewise#6767
ok, thanks.

[16-Feb-19 02:40 AM] Likewise#6767
woold it help if I buy some more KMD? 😉 Funny, never thought I got involved into small cap coins, not I bet my bag is one of the bigger ones here lol

[16-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Likewise#6767
now

[16-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Markus#5464
well im sure kmd got a rly bright future

[16-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Markus#5464
considering the tech and the speed they make it

[16-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Markus#5464
pretty amazing

[16-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Likewise#6767
oh yeah  and I got GRIN, put some funny money to work there. Rest is BTC

[16-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Likewise#6767
just wonder if all those techy stuff are being used, is their volume on the platform?

[16-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Likewise#6767
as  said before, regarding the tech stuff I'm not following

[16-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Markus#5464
it will be used once done, mm2 for decentralized exchange gonna be pretty good if im not wrong plan is maybe that coinbene going to possibly use it later on? that what i felt atleast when i read about their partnership that its possible

[16-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Markus#5464
and it seems like it will be possible to make games also since they already made this rogue game so there is rly alot of possibilities

[16-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Markus#5464
but i think komodo platform will be more for creators, they provide the tech and u use it as u like

[16-Feb-19 02:47 AM] Likewise#6767
does it have many competitors and are they on the same playing field?

[16-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Markus#5464
dont rly know but what ive read the decentralized exchange is not working similar to how other projects do it

[16-Feb-19 02:51 AM] Likewise#6767
ok, thx

[16-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Likewise#6767
has @Bitcoin Benny ever made a video about KMD's competitors?

[16-Feb-19 03:28 AM] Likewise#6767
@Markus not sure if I can post youtube links here. Anyway for realistic no nonsense TA on BTC check out Bob Loukas. As a few others he has been around the block trading wise.

[16-Feb-19 03:35 AM] Markus#5464
will check it out

@Likewise What primary school did you go to? I need to know so that I can make sure that my grand-kids never go there and get taught that 13.2+0=20

Say it with me: 
Rallies above Tenkan, (Conversion line) finds support, then rallies to next resistance (prior rejection 4 candles back) completes flip to support.
From there a rally should be in order. #Bitcoin $BTC

@hastrup It's called "freedom of speech" and "freedom of expression"; you should embrace it, it's been all the rage since the late 1700s

[16-Feb-19 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
P.S.- it's also the same concept that allows you to call me "a dick" 😉

@Lumbi `2 oracles, 2 bricks, and the color 'invisible'` sounds like a normal NYC Tuesday 😛

[16-Feb-19 05:24 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 freedom of speech do not mean free from consequence. when being mean to other one should except a backlash. i never call you a dick i just pointet out that one can ontribute to the community whitout bieng a dick, i did not specify you.

[16-Feb-19 05:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It was implicit in the sentence and context. Don't cowardly back-peddle through semantics now....

[16-Feb-19 05:30 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 XD cowardly lol like the edit. just thougt it was funny. but yeah it was i dick move what you told @Likewise  nothing more nothing less

[16-Feb-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hastrup The reality is that you implicitly called me a dick with 0 regard as to level of offensiveness that may carry
The difference between you doing that and me is that I don't try to hide it by pretending I didn't mean what I wrote, I own what I say

[16-Feb-19 05:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but yeah it was i dick move what you told @Likewise nothing more nothing less`
It's a "dick move" to not want my grand-kids taught that 13.2+0=20?

[16-Feb-19 05:36 PM] hastrup#8742
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  and now i know why that @allbits @Cryptoon  will not argue whit you  you are talking things to an extreme i cant get to.

[16-Feb-19 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I do admit that I enjoy the irony of you being offensive in complaining about me being offensive; it always tickles me when people do that 🙂

[16-Feb-19 05:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`will not argue whit you you are talking things to an extreme i cant get to.`
What have I taken to extreme? I used exact facts to point out the wrongness of his claim.

[16-Feb-19 05:39 PM] NNoperator#3835

[16-Feb-19 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
plz stop with the personal insulting

[16-Feb-19 08:43 PM] jl777c#5810
as to whether the price level today is better than a week ago, it seems it is. whether it is a beginning of bull run or not, it seems unlikely but not impossible that it has begun

[16-Feb-19 08:43 PM] Likewise#6767
sure, tellt hat too the kid. Regarding price, volume tells us enough to know this is not a sustained bull run.

[16-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
volume lower during weekend is normal

[16-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and 1000+ BTC per day volume is just not what KMD does

[16-Feb-19 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so of course it will come down from that

[16-Feb-19 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
still it is almost 250BTC, which is not bad for weekend day

[16-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Likewise#6767
sure but I tend to follow binance and day before pump 38 BTC, then we went to 750 BTC then teh dump start.....750 550 .....today 100 BTC, by tomorrow we should be back at 50 BTC volume. This shows me it was a pump and not a sustained run, a bigger pump but still a pump.

[16-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are saying for a sustained bull run volumes need to sustain 10x normal, then likely we will never have such a thing

[16-Feb-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
why is 10x levels required for a bull run?
