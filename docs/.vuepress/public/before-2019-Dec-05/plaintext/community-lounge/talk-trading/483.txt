interactive protocols just seem impractical for mass market

maybe with a glue layer to mask it, it can work

[21-Mar-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
there will never be any crypto in the future with 90% marketcap

[21-Mar-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`BTC is a fork of the original bitcoin chain. `
When did Roger hack @Deleted User's account 🤔

[21-Mar-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
from a monopoly marketshare, to lose it to being just number 1 marketcap (50% marketshare) in a matter of years is a tremendous testament to the skill of the ones managing it

[21-Mar-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont think the original bitcoin chain is still being mined at all

[21-Mar-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe some miners are keeping it alive

[21-Mar-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but I dont know of it specifically

[21-Mar-19 03:32 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is still alive on some few miners nodes

[21-Mar-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
imo, Bitcoin stopped being Bitcoin and became BTC when the community allowed Coinbase to decide what/who decided the protocol

[21-Mar-19 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
despite the utility, or lack of, for S2x, the lack of allowing consensus to decide the outcome changed everything

[21-Mar-19 03:34 PM] jl777c#5810
I wonder if a pre-segwit BTC node is run (that disallows segwit) if it would connect to any current nodes

[21-Mar-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
wouldn't min version disconnect it even if it did?

[21-Mar-19 03:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I gotta say i like how the talk here changes mood so drastically about btc being dead or alive by a flash correction.

[21-Mar-19 03:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like we are still in disbelief.

`I gotta say i like how the talk here changes mood so drastically about btc being dead or alive by a flash correction.`
I've gotta say that my position has been consistent since I 1st had issues installing bdb4.8, and not price level has swayed it ('No OS actively supports this antiquated shit, why are so many people in love with it?') 😛

[21-Mar-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 if the original BTC chain is still alive the version right before segwit would be a valid version

[21-Mar-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jl777c I meant client version. doesn't core client have a check that automatically disconnects "outdated" clients based on version numbers?

[21-Mar-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the same as our
`2019-03-21 10:34:20 peer=49 using obsolete version 0; disconnecting`

[21-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but any miner still mining the original BTC chain likely is running older client

[21-Mar-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
true

[21-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be compatible with the "just before segwit happened" clients

[21-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
that client would need to reject any segwit tx/blocks

[21-Mar-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
which the mining version would also need to do

this is a bit wrong as two of the top 3 addresses are SuperNET and MSHARK with in turn have thousands of holders, along with exchange addresses. so the effective distribution is much better

frankly, I'd be happy if all countries banned fiat transfer

lol

[21-Mar-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
seriously, did you get your introduction to fiat on an exchange? no, you used it as a currency

[21-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
lol why does Mexico give a fuck about crypto

[21-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe we need a crypto cartel down there

But they have to stop B to C services

[21-Mar-19 06:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
Its probably because btc remittance payments are eating into someone’s profits

[21-Mar-19 06:19 PM] PTYX#6840
As I understand it, btc isn't banned for business to businesses

It's an annual meetup they have in Acapulco

Lol so they ban crypto because hsbc launders all the Mexican cartel money anyways

@actionslacks unfortunately the banks are still making the laws. It will backfire though.

Bitcoin is too big now to outright deny it. Usually banning creats a black market which can increase its price and use among certain groups

[21-Mar-19 07:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the italian central bank too has released a report on Bitcoin and crypto a few days ago. Very negative views, i.e. they're useless, only criminals use it, etc... fortuntately they don't make laws and Italy must follow the future EU regulations that could be a little more sane

[21-Mar-19 08:30 PM] PHBA2061#2530
in my country (Viet Nam) you can trade cryptos but are forbidden from using it as payment methods.

but in the same time we're waiting for "acceptance"

with fiat we're certainly going to complete surveillance, crypto could still fail us but that would be no worse than the default road
