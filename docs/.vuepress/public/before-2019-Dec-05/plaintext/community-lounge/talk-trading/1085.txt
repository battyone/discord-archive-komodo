adoption is going to be the driver (or should be the driver) that gets it over 10$

[20-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Neko#5830
and komodo got some juice

[20-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Markus#5464
I have watched a interesting vid on youtube about Chinas growth past 10 years, i can see why kmd wanna get adoption there

[20-Aug-19 05:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but a nice pump/bull cycle can take it to 2$+

[20-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Markus#5464
This guy Benny knows whats up

[20-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah for sure

[20-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you have soooo many companies

[20-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
that are unknown to us

[20-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but reach 100s of millions of chinese people

[20-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
Also read how chinese ppl work, thats not stupid ppl i can tell u

[20-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
i feel embarassed over my country after seeing that vid about China

[20-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
people bitching too much about their situation and not wanting to do anything about it in the West tbh

[20-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Markus#5464
yes

[20-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
'oh no, so many people make more money than me, that is not fair'

[20-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
instead of just going out there and grab their own life by the horns and be your own driver of change

[20-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Markus#5464
indeed

[20-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Markus#5464
totaly agree with that

[20-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
people here are maybe too spoiled

[20-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean it's a good thing that we dont let people die in the streets etc

[20-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but I think some people are just too easy with the fact that everything is done for them

[20-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Markus#5464
Yes definitely altho u have alot of corruption when it comes to politics and most of ppl dont see this cause their not interested or open their eyes to reality

[20-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Markus#5464
thats why they keep voting for same shit over and over then keep blaming

[20-Aug-19 05:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's more comforting to think that your government is good and efficient

[20-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but once you really understand how much money/effort is wasted

[20-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and how much money disappears in the wrong people's pockets

[20-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
it's hard not to be angry

[20-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Markus#5464
its hard to even imagine how much money we talk about but its insane amounts

[20-Aug-19 05:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
billions

[20-Aug-19 05:59 PM] Markus#5464
Yea for sure

[20-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Markus#5464
I watched a vid how a city in China grew from having water on streets, around 600k ppl living there to 11 million in just 10 years and whole city remade to top notch

Most of the stuff built over there starts falling apart pretty rapidly. But by then the developers have sold the building and are on to the next one. The Chinese like to buy apartments that are brand new for this reason.

Bitcoin trying to build CC like Antara? üòõ

[20-Aug-19 06:28 PM] tolken#2655
funny, they‚Äôre just getting started, Antara seems to be a real thing. Hopefully more tangible examples will surface soon to show people the power. The Antara CMC might be a cool demo.

[20-Aug-19 06:45 PM] PHBA2061#2530
smart contracts on Bitcoin is not something new though <https://www.rsk.co/technology/>

[20-Aug-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it adds no new functionality: "Miniscript builds on top of Script, able to ‚Äúcompile‚Äù to bitcoin‚Äôs native language."

Lightning Network fees might have to be as much as on-chain fees to cover plain costs with someone running 40% of the network at a big loss.

That‚Äôs seems like a lot of responsibility for 20$ a month lol

Let me borrow $5 million and pay $20 a month for the rest of my life :troll:

only cost $12k for 50 years

[20-Aug-19 07:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i laughed when i read about Miniscript and found out it completely relies on segwit and only benefits things that fully drink the segwit koolaid, says it barely supports plain P2SH. It's further entrenching all those bad ideas. The marketing machine for it is alive and well, as everybody can see

[20-Aug-19 08:46 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
how is the rfox token valued?

[20-Aug-19 08:56 PM] PTYX#6840
By speculation as all other coins i suppose

[20-Aug-19 09:09 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
but what is it used for? what is the purpose of owning or givingany vlaue to an rfox token

[20-Aug-19 09:10 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
kmd serves as a base pair of liquidity for ecosystem coins and is also going to be used for discounts on dexs

[20-Aug-19 09:10 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
arrr is used as a currency so you can make useof the privacy features

[20-Aug-19 09:10 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
what does the rfox token do

[20-Aug-19 09:23 PM] PHBA2061#2530
it is specified in its whitepaper

[20-Aug-19 09:34 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

So it‚Äòs offical that K64 is a scam? Can I dump my 1000 K64 for 0,5KMD at 0,08 KMD :abusedsmily:

[21-Aug-19 09:26 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's not a scam, don't dump anything

[21-Aug-19 09:27 AM] Mische#6695

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Markus#5464
i wonder when kmd price will wake up

[21-Aug-19 03:25 PM] Markus#5464
its literally dead for months

[21-Aug-19 03:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Was going to rebuy at 80 cent but still waiting, 587-60 cent was last low when btc was at 3500.... ü§î

[21-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
Its interesting that btc consolidating for quite sometime already

[21-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Markus#5464
but everything else getting rekt

[21-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Markus#5464
if btc decides to start pushing now and goes to 16k or so then alts will barely exist anymore

[21-Aug-19 03:41 PM] joe2x4#5987
To me it appears that once the U$ has most of the onramps and offramps locked down, then and only then will it pamp. By then the plebs will have missed the big rise and fomo herded into cattle runs.

[21-Aug-19 03:45 PM] tolken#2655
Gut feeling, but I think the Binance transition happening now is part of whats driving this low activity. A lot of uncertainty. Once we past the sept 1st threshold, I suspect we‚Äôll see more activity, particularly as we head toward the end of the month and Bakkt launches. May not mean a bull market, but I expect activity to pickup. Volumes have been ridiculously low lately.

[21-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
I expect those 250k kmd to get dumped

[21-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Markus#5464
kmd making bearish signs on daily

[21-Aug-19 03:47 PM] Markus#5464
Making lower price but higher macd, thats terrible

[21-Aug-19 04:00 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Just bought some more btc instead of KMD, dont think KMD will do anything before btc does so think its the smart thing (smart and crypto might turn out to be non-existent in the future but oke)

[21-Aug-19 04:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I thought it would hold the 1 dollar mark much more firm when i bought but it fell without any resistance to 80 cents and now we at 70 cents

[21-Aug-19 04:01 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Have enough KMD to be happy when it does pump so its fine anyway

[21-Aug-19 04:12 PM] tolken#2655
250k Kmd dump massive, seems unlikely to me. Of course some will exchange hands, but with the whole 250k airdrop contest, we didn‚Äôt see any appreciable uptick in Kmd price, quite the contrary, so I think sellers are mostly exhausted.

[21-Aug-19 04:14 PM] tolken#2655
that 250k is quite a large reward, I‚Äôm surprised more people didn‚Äôt hold to get a chunk of it.

[21-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Neko#5830
everyone expecting dump it will pump

[21-Aug-19 04:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
all the garbage needs to get purged. so many top alts are trash that the sooner the reckoning comes, the better for the whole space. as long as btc stays up, kmd survives the carnage and becomes stronger

[21-Aug-19 04:36 PM] CoinKing88#1540
it would be common sense that a few whales who got a big piece of that 250K KMD want to sell high, so pump and then dump

[21-Aug-19 04:37 PM] CoinKing88#1540
they are not gonna marketsell 150K KMD after taking a huge hit while holding KMD to get that 150K KMD in the first place

[21-Aug-19 04:41 PM] tolken#2655
@CoinKing88 agreed

[21-Aug-19 04:42 PM] tolken#2655
we‚Äôll see soon enough üòâ

[21-Aug-19 05:07 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nice price action

[21-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
there was a 70k market sell yesterday

[21-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Markus#5464
so why would they not dump 150k

[21-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Markus#5464
it didnt cost them anything to get those coins airdropped anyway

[21-Aug-19 05:21 PM] tolken#2655
Opportunity cost,

Play out = we might not see 10k again this year

[21-Aug-19 05:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
We are at 10K now

[21-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
Yes cause we are on the neckline, it didnt play out yet

[21-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
but if it does it can go as low as 7k

[21-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Markus#5464
i dont think it will go so low if it plays out

[21-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
but its possible

[21-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Markus#5464
Its crypto afterall
