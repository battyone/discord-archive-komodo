[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Alts will turn soon

[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR 20k

[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ARRR will easily reach $5 soon too

[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not sure if serious :p

[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im serious

[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[21-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Malti#3948
based on what exactly @siu - Chainmakers ?

[21-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Malti#3948
for me it's hard to see what is possible for arrr as it goes to ath's and thus in unexplored territory

[21-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Markus#5464
@Malti but why do unexplored territory matter? TA doesnt work anyway ! :troll_king:

[21-Jun-19 01:08 PM] Malti#3948
I think TA works very well _based on probabilities_ and in established markets like BTC and KMD

[21-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Malti#3948
to find bottoms etc

[21-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Malti#3948
but for a new coin like ARRR, FA is the way to go

[21-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Malti#3948
but to decide on a top with FA, seems hard

[21-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Malti#3948
jl always mentions the 10% marketcap of XMR if I'm not mistaken

[21-Jun-19 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im not calling tops or anything

[21-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Malti#3948
_not calling 5$ the top makes me even happier_

[21-Jun-19 01:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Im estimating a fair value given the bull market we seem to be moving in to

[21-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Keppie#5156
Cme futures trading for 10.000 usd btw

[21-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Sherdogz#6731
So what do you look for if you're talking about FA for arrr? Biside active development and maybe community... What are the differences between all the ather privacy coins.

[21-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Malti#3948
bigger anon set than zcash e.g.

[21-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Malti#3948
growth potential due to exchange listings

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Malti#3948
XMR admins admitting ARRR being the superior anon coin over XMR

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Malti#3948
in telegram

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Yes growth potential is a good one

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Did they really?

[21-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Malti#3948
the active focus on adoption

[21-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Malti#3948
Yes, i don't have the screenshot tho

"moronic name"

[21-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Markus#5464
:troll_lol:

[21-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Malti#3948
they admitted ARRR being better than XMR so i'm not even mad

[21-Jun-19 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Right, lets use a zodiac sign name, make it less moronic

[21-Jun-19 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why dont wr name it CANCER

[21-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Malti#3948
I like Monero name

[21-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Malti#3948
it's esperanto for money

[21-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948
which implies the universality

[21-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Malti#3948
but Pirate/ARRR is going to be remembered
