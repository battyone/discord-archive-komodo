[28-Jul-19 07:43 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Jul-19 07:44 PM] Caglio#3337

[28-Jul-19 08:18 PM] Alright#0419

i think

[28-Jul-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
look on blockchain for when it was actually sent

[28-Jul-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe txfee was low

[28-Jul-19 09:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Any Elliot wave fans have Komodo mapped ?

[28-Jul-19 09:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
For me it looks like we are in wave 5

[28-Jul-19 09:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Downwards

[28-Jul-19 09:25 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
On daily

[28-Jul-19 09:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
We can see a abc correction hopefully in the near future

[28-Jul-19 09:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Which , dare I say it ?? Put us on the moon boys

[28-Jul-19 09:26 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Maybe see a double bottom though before this

[28-Jul-19 09:29 PM] hastrup#8742
@Caglio  yes it sound like the tx fee was low like jl77 7said

[28-Jul-19 11:17 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Who wants to talk about trading lol

[28-Jul-19 11:17 PM] Caglio#3337
@jl777c  @hastrup i dont get it what happens when tx fee is low ? and I thought coinbase fee is always the same?

[28-Jul-19 11:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Komodo in the Apex brothers

[28-Jul-19 11:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Up or down

When price action / chart channel ?

[29-Jul-19 12:06 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
do monero or dash have any issues with their privacy features?

[29-Jul-19 12:09 AM] Alright#0419
don't know a damn thing about dash's, but XMR transactions can be de-obfuscated if you spam the chain enough

very impractical attack for anyone without millions of dollars to burn, but possible nonetheless

[29-Jul-19 12:10 AM] Alright#0419
still think XMR is the best option

[29-Jul-19 12:17 AM] hastrup#8742
@Caglio If the TX fee is not high enough the miners will not mine it so  one need to wait until the miners have mine your block so if one exchange use a lowbtx fee  it will take a long time befor one will get one coins

[29-Jul-19 12:17 AM] Caglio#3337
@hastrup thats the thing

[29-Jul-19 12:17 AM] Caglio#3337
it usually take 6 transactions on coinbase

[29-Jul-19 12:17 AM] Caglio#3337
it had like 20 in few mins

[29-Jul-19 12:18 AM] Caglio#3337
thats what has been scaring me

[29-Jul-19 12:18 AM] hastrup#8742
It is not fix  I could take 10 min or 3 hours

[29-Jul-19 12:18 AM] Caglio#3337
sorry?

[29-Jul-19 12:19 AM] Caglio#3337
anyway this never happened before

[29-Jul-19 12:19 AM] hastrup#8742
If coinbase is not using enough TX

[29-Jul-19 12:19 AM] Caglio#3337
im glad it worked in the end, but it really took time

[29-Jul-19 12:20 AM] Caglio#3337
but id there possibility

[29-Jul-19 12:20 AM] Caglio#3337
they use little tx on that tramssction

[29-Jul-19 12:20 AM] Caglio#3337
and more on other

[29-Jul-19 12:20 AM] Caglio#3337
cos i sent again after an hour and that tramsaction went instantly

[29-Jul-19 12:20 AM] hastrup#8742
Like a said if they used a to low TX it could take a long time it is not fix time

[29-Jul-19 12:21 AM] hastrup#8742
Today it could be 20 sat for 20 min but tomorrow it could be 40 sat for 20 min hope it make sense

[29-Jul-19 12:22 AM] Caglio#3337

`rip kmd`
yes, KMD lost 7% of buy power in the time that BTC lost 10%, all hope is lost

[29-Jul-19 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
never mind that the net effect is that KMD is 3% stronger than BTC
sell it all now!

[29-Jul-19 08:41 AM] Markus#5464
Yes

[29-Jul-19 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
