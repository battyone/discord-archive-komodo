Imagine USD becomes worthless

[02-Nov-19 09:20 AM] farl#9964
I can imagine that

[02-Nov-19 10:12 AM] Flint#6435
The dollar will dominate for a very long time - do not have illusions! Yes, it will weaken in relation to bitcoin many times, but in a percentage of the dollar turnover in the world and the bitcoin turnover, it is ridiculous to compare! Bitcoin is good if in 50 years it reaches the same turnover as the dollar! Rather, the United States will try to gain control of the most liquid and expensive cryptocurrencies than strengthen its dollar and reduce its public debt

[02-Nov-19 10:14 AM] Flint#6435
but for most countries in the world it will be very difficult amid inflation, especially if the world crisis reappears! It will be easier for China and most difficult for Latin America

[02-Nov-19 10:17 AM] farl#9964
Yes, the dollar will exist, but not as reserve currency of the world. Too many signals this is getting worse as we speak. And history stated that a reserve currency gets changed every few decades. The dollar is already expired.

Isn't chart on apex already be too long for us to get excited?

[02-Nov-19 10:47 AM] Mark81#4505
'''Breakout Timeframe: The ideal breakout point occurs 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through the pattern's development or time-span. The time-span of the pattern can be measured from the apex (convergence of upper and lower lines) back to the beginning of the lower trend line (base). A break before the 1/2 way point might be premature and a break too close to the apex may be insignificant. After all, as the apex approaches, a breakout must occur sometime.'''

I've previously seen a breakdown on rewards for some of the different komodo assests, including DEX.  Can someone point me in the right direction on where to find that?  And now that DEX is listed on atomicDex, I'm curious if there is any estimation on what amount of reward/fees will be received for 1 DEX.  Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

This wasn't supposed to have been published this early. We'll give out more details on the DuneDEX when it's time. I've reached out to the Dune team to ask why it was announced at such an early time.

I now have access to about 3,000 unique emails from the BitMEX leak.

- from what I can tell, there is more than 30,000 unique emails in total
- 67% emails (from my sample size) use gmail, 7% hotmail, 4% yahoo, 3% protonmail

nSPV has already been developed but still the news has not spread widely across the cryptocurrency world - it will be the effect of a bomb because this is a breakthrough technology that is very underestimated because the Internet of things will give massive adoption among other fantastic innovations in the project, so the previous maximum of $ 12 is even a very modest mark

@jl777c what are the plans to obtain those resources? Funds were already not high to begin with and continues to decrease everyday. Low KMD price does not help either

[03-Nov-19 06:48 PM] jl777c#5810
making gui and end user products is expensive

[03-Nov-19 06:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if we have the funds to do it, we can do more of it, but if we dont, we would just have to wait for projects that build on komodo to make such

[03-Nov-19 06:50 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think it is reasonable to expect us to create all possible end user services from our tech, that would literally take tens of millions of dollars, efficiently used

[03-Nov-19 06:52 PM] jl777c#5810
as a platform, making our own end user products is always a bit complicated as we dont want to be competing with other projects that build on komodo. with atomicDEX it is a special case as it isnt strictly a komodo platform product, plus it is an important component for many other aspects

[03-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  who from the ecosystem claims to resolve this issue? Does anyone already have experience?

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
resolve what issue?

[03-Nov-19 07:05 PM] jl777c#5810
is it a real issue that we dont have tens of millions to spend to make all the possible end user products using komodo tech?

[03-Nov-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
a platform should enable others to build on it, it shouldnt build all things itself. that would be a different entity, one that requires a lot of capital

maybe this metaphor could be good: a motor maker does not make cars, that is for carmakers, and also for carmakers to put those motors into their cars

[03-Nov-19 07:21 PM] Flint#6435
@jl777c  Yes, Im talking about this - about the development by other teams in the Komodo ecosystem, you correctly noticed that now it‚Äôs better to focus on DEX and others can solve problems if other teams have the competency and experience

[03-Nov-19 07:25 PM] Flint#6435
it‚Äôs interesting to know, for example, if there are IoT experts in the Komodo-ecosystem to apply your awesome nSPV development? it would very quickly attract the attention of big business and third-party developers

[03-Nov-19 07:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There has been some external interest for use of Komodo in IoT and similar industries.  However at this time, much still needs built

it seems ready for external parties to start developing

[03-Nov-19 07:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I meant built as in a usecase for the external developer side.   they still are figuring out how to monetize blockchain with IoT effectively, and obviously that is beyond our scope, as we just provide tech.  Though if we could get a demo of a basic use case up I think that might help with the more serious acquisition of third party development.   Something physical, not as abstract as just the code itself.

Data security and integrity for PLC‚Äôs utilizing blockchain PoW .   Current issue in industry there is a lack of cyber security for PLC devices , and it is not unheard of for a disgruntled employee or competitor/saboteur to alter the functionality of the PLC and cause massive damage and loss.  Basically recording state / hashes of files on chain secured with PoW and notarizations could greatly mitigate this kind of behavior while being cost effective alarm, forensic and prevention system. Seems to be a combination of DTO observing and reporting to a chain that is being notarized.

can you elaborate why you think  IoT needs nSPV ?

[03-Nov-19 07:58 PM] Flint#6435
Yes the problem is also that people are afraid to use systems such as smart homes built on the Internet of things because they are afraid of tracking privacy and leakage of personal data, because you have to trust vulnerable software with a single point of failure, and the blockchain solves this problem, and especially the blockchain in partnership with Amazon capable of scaling up to a million operations per second and with a super light client

[03-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Flint#6435
@PHBA2061  nSPV is very memory demanding for example

[03-Nov-19 08:01 PM] Flint#6435
no need to download the all blockchain and therefore it is applicable in the simplest and most light devices of the IoT
