Stable or rising KMD while BTC is pumping is indeed attractive to those who sort on % gains on cmc

From biggest loser to biggest winner

[28-Jun-19 03:30 PM] yorklab#7270
Easy to be the biggest winner when you were one of the biggest losers previously.

[28-Jun-19 03:31 PM] yorklab#7270
Funny how everybody was upset about it going to 12 k while back, now everybody's happy about it going to 12 k. It's all perspective.

[28-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Alexfrog#1338
im still upset

[28-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Mark81#4505

Well, I have to be in the mid-20s just to break even, but I am happy it's going up that's for sure.

[28-Jun-19 03:33 PM] crumb#2550
yes, marketing crew has to get credit for their good work

[28-Jun-19 03:34 PM] crumb#2550

KMD should be blowing up after the super dump of the last   few days/week we are still far away from 20k

[28-Jun-19 03:34 PM] crumb#2550
we need to be more equal, both in praise and bashing

[28-Jun-19 03:35 PM] crumb#2550
15k, 20k, 25k is meaningless

[28-Jun-19 03:35 PM] crumb#2550
your timeframe is too short

[28-Jun-19 03:36 PM] crumb#2550
probably most who sell for 300% gain will start to regret their impatience pretty quick

[28-Jun-19 03:37 PM] yorklab#7270
I'm waiting for the time when 25k becomes the new bottom.

[28-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i cant believe it hit 880

[28-Jun-19 03:39 PM] MdAmazing#4020

If you haven't routinely searched for bitcoin news in years like me, 
I'm sure you're not as surprised by this article as I am. 
FT has faithfully represented the view of mainstream economists who would never admit Bitcoin. 
I've never seen bitcoin in FT like this. I especially like the last quote. 
I'm cautious, but isn't this an article perhaps a herald of a shift in readiness for the global financial elite? lol
