"more" implies that there is any fundamental level of worldly education. 😣

I wrote them 2 days ago about BTCD to replace with KMD

[06-Sep-18 04:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but maybe you also can try

[06-Sep-18 04:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if once a week someone will write them maybe they finally do sth

[06-Sep-18 04:43 PM] Markus#5464
Dump is cause of btc wallet that been dead for 4 years moving 110,000 bitcoins and dumping them

[06-Sep-18 04:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
As I already said

[06-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If it was a silkroad wallet a CEX wouldnt touch it because they would have the feds come knocking

[06-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And that wallet was linked to silkroad

[06-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, if you had that kind of cash, dumping it all at once would be very stupid because of slippage 😃

[06-Sep-18 04:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Cryptoon  unless you dump to buy using another account, so that you buy cheap on another account which is not suspected... loundering BTC using cex

[06-Sep-18 04:52 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or you simply hacked and want to decrease price and buy low

[06-Sep-18 04:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idk

[06-Sep-18 04:54 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if I had 100k BTC (hacked account) and didnt know how to wash it probably I would just dump it on same fake account and rebuy cheap BTC using another account, but maybe it's not very clever

[06-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Markus#5464
better sell the btc and buy KMD with it

[06-Sep-18 04:57 PM] Markus#5464
hehe

[06-Sep-18 05:34 PM] Cryptoon#3362
just use a DEX if you had that much?

[06-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Use a DEX and wash it to KMD/ZEC/XMR whatever

[06-Sep-18 07:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Might have to advertise that

[06-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
And offer better than market by a few percent

[06-Sep-18 07:35 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

see you next year, guys

[07-Sep-18 08:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
tbh it's kind of the same 'analysis' that takes into account block reward halvenings etc

[07-Sep-18 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Such long term predictions are to be taken with a boatload of salt

[07-Sep-18 08:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As long term price is determined even more by adoption or external demand influxes that are influenced by regulations etc.

[07-Sep-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If Trinidad & Tobago announces tomorrow that they will completely switch to bitcoin or any other crypto for their monetary system, this will create a big shock

[07-Sep-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
etc etc

[07-Sep-18 08:11 AM] jorian#4555
true, but that's a big if. ETF decision would be an indicator of where we'd go from here

What if the ETF is approved when everyone expects it to be delayed?

[07-Sep-18 11:03 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What could possibly happen? 🤔 🚀

[07-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Massive dump to completely wreck the longs that will stack up

[07-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

Because Wall Street doesn’t plan on paying chuckleheads off

[07-Sep-18 11:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’ll run them through with the long sword dick of 100 years of fiat power consolidation

[07-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Same as last year

[07-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then they’ll drink the blood of the panic animals and moon it all to hell and back

[07-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Long the bullrun untill the date the ETF is effectively launched

[07-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Short the ETF itself

[07-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
just like the CME/CBOE shenaningans last year

[07-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I remember the day it topped

[07-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Every chucklehead on the street was cycling their blockfolio checking their gains

[07-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It was 15k in the morning

[07-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I told some random guy it would hit 20k the same day and then be over

[07-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
For the time anyway

[07-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Of course I didn’t sell because I’m a chucklehead hodler since ‘15/‘16

[07-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[07-Sep-18 04:14 PM] ryman112#0068
Goldman Sachs says it was fake news lmao when is all this nonsense gonna stop.   And by now you would think that anyone in this space would stop panic selling the second they see a negative  article that is false.  I mean how many times will the majority fall for this crap.

[07-Sep-18 04:15 PM] ryman112#0068

Forget about dApps with no users, let's talk about tokens with no users.

Only 27 cryptocurrencies had over 400 active addresses today. Yes. 400 users.

You'd think if there was ever a time to 'buy the dip' or 'panic sell' it would be today. 🤷‍♂️
