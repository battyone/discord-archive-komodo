@Keppie <3 Im a lovely troll :troll_king: :troll_king: :troll_thuglife:

[11-May-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i think what most people forget is the nearly instant drop from $6000 down to $3500 level

[11-May-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that certainly seemed abnormal, and by contrast a lost steeper than this rise

[11-May-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
just so many people were on the bear side of the fence, even after it broke $4100 they are all still waiting for the "inevitable" retrace. which i guess TA indicates should happen.

[11-May-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
however, when there is a lot of force to a move, it sort of hits the reset button

[11-May-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and until things reach an equilibrium, the driving force dominates

[11-May-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the trend is your friend

[11-May-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
until this bull trend stops, it will still be going up. guaranteed!

[11-May-19 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
BTC historically have left everyone waiting for that lower low correction

[11-May-19 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
since just a small amount of capital (relatively speaking) can literally paint whatever BTC chart they want, it will be when they decide to stop forcing the issue that more normal patterns to happen

[11-May-19 04:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that has always become the fuel to pump it out of danger zone

[11-May-19 04:17 PM] Markus#5464
I think alot of ppl are stuck looking at "the wall street sheet" waiting for "depression & anger"

[11-May-19 04:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
depression and anger is already happening to alts bag holders

[11-May-19 04:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ðŸ˜‚

[11-May-19 04:18 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
me included, although not depressed or angered, my faith moves mountains sometimes

[11-May-19 04:18 PM] Markus#5464
will be interesting to see where this btc rally will top out

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
eventually it will have to correct abit

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt have to

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] Markus#5464
every bullrun have small correction of a few days

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i see a stairstep pattern

[11-May-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
price is moved up a few percent every couple days

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No retraces! no correction! just green dildos! :troll:

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464
so u see a stairstep pattern up to end of this bull market? ðŸ˜„

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is whales painting the chart, then until they stop painting the charts, they are painting the charts

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say that

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
what I am saying is that there is no way to predict how long they will do this

[11-May-19 04:20 PM] Markus#5464
ye thats true

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but the current pattern from $4100+ has been to boost the price 3% to 5%, wait for it to come back down a bit, then another 3% to 5%, over a few days, it seems even on weekend. maybe this is a "natural" heartbeat of new money coming in.whatever it is, i think it will go on until it stops

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and until it stops, the best bet is that it will keep doing it

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so just watch the market

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] Markus#5464
do u think its whales doing this or institutional money like fidelity buying to cover their upcoming customer needs?

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is any doubt the bear is over, it should be said, the bear market is over

[11-May-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
fidelity is a whale

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but look at the news cycle

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
less resistance path is up now

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it changed 180 degrees

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is all part of the big game,suppress prices with bad news, OTC buys and public market dumps

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
accumulate as much as possible

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] alen#3721
Changed most of my alts to btc..except kmd ofcourse..im having big hopes for kmd

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
then to make profits,it needs to get into bull market again

[11-May-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
so here we are, in the transition

[11-May-19 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
these days of BTC going up and where sideways is the "down" and going up again. that is what BTC does

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i did say the other day i wouldnt be surprised at 7k

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] Caglio#3337
I wish komodo makes me a millionare however I need more than 50KMD then

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
up, sideways, up sideways, up sideways

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no retraces!

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[11-May-19 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
sideways is the retrace

[11-May-19 04:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:shexy:

[11-May-19 04:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I like how bitcoin always finds a way to do what it wants, not what people say

[11-May-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be that the SEC report is a big trigger for this as at least there are rules to follow, while before you could try to follow the rules, but they were subject to arbitrary change, ie. risk

[11-May-19 04:28 PM] Markus#5464
isnt there a ETF announcement 16th also?

[11-May-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
with SEC guidance, I think a lot of institutional money is able to be released as whenever there are some set of rules to be followed,you just need enough lawyers to figure out how to do it with most advantage

Many online brokers are adding direct btc trading now

[11-May-19 04:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think apps like robinhood made many brokers understand that if you let people buy the btc but not transfer them, it makes it easier to be compliant

[11-May-19 04:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so now many other brokers like fidelity, tdameritrade and such are adding direct btc buying with no ETF intermediary

[11-May-19 04:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think that is the real big deal behind this

[11-May-19 04:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
my dad sent me a photo of the btc ticker when it passed $6k, when i saw that i checked the charts and all fell in place... new bull was in... mom and pop took a look at btc again

[11-May-19 04:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and this time it will  be available in their current trading accounts with their regular brokers

[11-May-19 04:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no need to do accounts in sketchy bfx and such

[11-May-19 04:53 PM] Caglio#3337
back where ?

[11-May-19 04:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
nope, still ded

[11-May-19 04:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i tried to kick it, didnt move

[11-May-19 04:58 PM] Markus#5464
ouch kmd is fully rekt mode

[11-May-19 04:58 PM] Markus#5464
will we see a new low possibly?

[11-May-19 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
down to 13k sats?

[11-May-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
TA says KMD for sure will be 1000 sats

[11-May-19 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
can happen... not out of the question

[11-May-19 04:59 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Usd wise it seems to be a different story

[11-May-19 04:59 PM] Markus#5464
true that

[11-May-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers robinhood has like a custodial wallet?

[11-May-19 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
you can buy it and not do anything with it other than trade?

[11-May-19 05:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if i understand correctly, in robinhood you can buy btc but cant actually transfer them

[11-May-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just buy and hold balance, then sell

[11-May-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have not tested it tho

[11-May-19 05:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but afaik, that is the setup

[11-May-19 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
am not happy to hear that

[11-May-19 05:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
me neither, but im not forced to use their service

[11-May-19 05:02 PM] Alright#0419
that just reinforces the idea that it's solely a speculative asset :/

[11-May-19 05:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
so far, for 99% of the world population that is what it is.

[11-May-19 05:05 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't think I have enough coins for a life changing situation lol

[11-May-19 05:05 PM] Vertigo#0439
Maybe to upgrade my lawnmower

[11-May-19 05:07 PM] Vertigo#0439
How much kmd you think is a decent bag to hold?

[11-May-19 05:07 PM] Vertigo#0439

Lol

[11-May-19 05:08 PM] Vertigo#0439
That is like a year and a half salary worth of kmd for me lol

[11-May-19 05:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Higher risk, higher reward

[11-May-19 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If it was low risk everyone would be doing it and the rewards wouldnt be equally big ðŸ˜ƒ

[11-May-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810
short BTC at 100x leverage, retrace is inevitable

[11-May-19 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok sir jl, I just went allin!

[11-May-19 05:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[11-May-19 05:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont have dog, is cat fine too?
