I sold at 19k today so = I won

[04-Jun-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, you sold at 17 and bought back at < 17?

[04-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Tek#5253
yes

[04-Jun-19 02:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[04-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Tek#5253

so, the answer is no you didn't buy back at 14 and you made pennies selling at 17 and buying back at like 16.5 🤦🏽

[04-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Tek#5253
2 to 5% every day

[04-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Tek#5253
is great

[04-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Tek#5253

OK, I was wrong, you didn't make pennies, you made nickles 🤦🏽

[04-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Tek#5253
im gaining sats thats all I care about for the moment

[04-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Tek#5253
i picked up those 1000 around 15k and managed to sell them again at 19k

[04-Jun-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that's your other fail, you ignore buying power

[04-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Tek#5253
with stops

[04-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Tek#5253
I bought back and sold many times each range

[04-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Tek#5253
so I did fine

[04-Jun-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and when BTC tanks back to $6200, you lost value

[04-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Tek#5253
if BTC tanks to 6200 kmd will tank to 14k

[04-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Tek#5253
wait no I think itl stay higher

[04-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Tek#5253
16k

[04-Jun-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and still be a relative gain because BTC is moot

[04-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Tek#5253
gain is gain

[04-Jun-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not if BTC sats is your goal, then you have BTC and loss not KMD gain

[04-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Tek#5253
BTC sats is my goal for as long as BTC is dominant

[04-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Tek#5253
but I already have a holding stack

[04-Jun-19 02:33 PM] Tek#5253

For the record, @Tek , I am happy you are making gains. Some people in this thread hate to see others prosper.

[04-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Tek#5253
yeah man

[04-Jun-19 04:13 PM] Tek#5253

picking up pennies in front of a steamroller- if you are lucky, good for you! 🚂 
maybe some people seem to be a bit negative about this because they get the impression you believe to work some kind of magic or so..

[04-Jun-19 04:17 PM] Tek#5253
ETH looks juicy

[04-Jun-19 04:18 PM] Tek#5253

[04-Jun-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`as if 2 to 5% per trade isn't worth it`
2-5% on a $7.30 trade is unimpressive when you're calling folks a "pleb"
#JustSayin

[04-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Tek#5253
I sold 1000 KMD a few times for 2 to 5%

[04-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Tek#5253
can you now shut up

[04-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Tek#5253
you can't even make an order thats worht less than 8 bux on binance

[04-Jun-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
20 buys at 19 different prices is not "per trade"

[04-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Tek#5253
yes it is you stupid fuckhead

[04-Jun-19 04:22 PM] Tek#5253
I trade I take 2 to 5 % multiple times

[04-Jun-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
**EACH** line on your ledger is "per trade"

[04-Jun-19 04:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that you traded 1k over 20 trades is not one trade
