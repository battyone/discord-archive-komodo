btc dominance about to get rekt

[14-Aug-19 09:59 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
rulers turn their own currency intentionally worthless. They are now poor. I don't follow your logic there mate

[14-Aug-19 09:59 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Tek

[14-Aug-19 09:59 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

[14-Aug-19 10:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Tek I found video of the shark tank guy o Leary where he says in 2013 he has 3 percent his networth in btc lmao

[14-Aug-19 10:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Meanwhile 2 person's owning more than 1 % btc supply

[14-Aug-19 10:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896

#BitcoinCash is doing things no other payment network can do.

Noncustodial payment automation and next generation ICOs, STOs, and DAOs are coming.

Simpler and more powerful than smart contracts. 

Instant, reliable, inexpensive, and scalable!

Winklevoss twins probably own more then 1%

[14-Aug-19 10:24 AM] Tek#5253
didn't they 200k bitcoin for $1/piece

[14-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
something like that

[14-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
but they own Gemini exchange

[14-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
so they get more btc non stop

[14-Aug-19 10:25 AM] Markus#5464
from fees

[14-Aug-19 10:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
So if btc goes too 100k they can literally buy up every country in the world together with some other individuals

[14-Aug-19 10:31 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Many former cartel sellers from silk road and other shady crooks

[14-Aug-19 10:32 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
All that while we will also moon and make it

[14-Aug-19 10:32 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I don't believe it anymore

[14-Aug-19 10:32 AM] Markus#5464
i think 100k is just a meme

[14-Aug-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
i dont see it happening anytime soon

[14-Aug-19 10:33 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yeah

[14-Aug-19 10:33 AM] Markus#5464
if btc would hit 100k i would say kmd is minimum 100$ by then

[14-Aug-19 10:34 AM] Markus#5464
waiting for @Tek  to say that Dash will be 10k by then :troll_lol:

They all already in since 2013

[14-Aug-19 10:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's doomed

[14-Aug-19 10:35 AM] Markus#5464
smart money are not stupid ppl, also they dont flex like beginners

[14-Aug-19 10:35 AM] Markus#5464
many of them might have been in since it was less then 100$

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] Markus#5464
i mean if u have billions why would u not risk 100k to potentially make it into billions

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Ofc would do the same

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
But imagine where the money must come from for them to cash out

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
It's from us shitcoin chasers

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Lol

[14-Aug-19 10:36 AM] Markus#5464
im not sure they would cash it out, they have enough fiat to not care

[14-Aug-19 10:37 AM] Markus#5464
or they could just leverage it by buying apartments/houses and so on and keep renting them out

[14-Aug-19 11:17 AM] klein#5233
WeWork Just filed for its IPO

[14-Aug-19 11:18 AM] klein#5233
