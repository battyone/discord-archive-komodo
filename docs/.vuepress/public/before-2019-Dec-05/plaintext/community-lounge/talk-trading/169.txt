not over county lines

[21-Sep-18 12:15 PM] snowdamn#2414
PNW?

[21-Sep-18 12:16 PM] snowdamn#2414
oh, got it

[21-Sep-18 12:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
yep just growing buds govt... nothing to see here

[21-Sep-18 12:17 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
In Italy paid the taxes only on the capital gain of what I cashed out in euro

[21-Sep-18 12:17 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I didn't even track every crypto to crypto exchange, I could not have complied anyway

[21-Sep-18 12:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the US system si crazy

[21-Sep-18 12:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
cap gains is why bittrex fell off

[21-Sep-18 12:18 PM] snowdamn#2414
yes, it will change wherever they ask for crypto-to-crypto, they're just taking advantage

[21-Sep-18 12:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
everyone went to binance

[21-Sep-18 12:19 PM] actionslacks#4072
but i dont trade crypto

[21-Sep-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the US system si crazy`
How is it crazy? they only changed the rules 14 times between Jan1 and tax file deadline in April :trollface:

[21-Sep-18 12:20 PM] snowdamn#2414
it will be capital gains on crypto-to-fiat, but will get hit with capital gains on full amount if you can't prove entry

[21-Sep-18 12:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
its not property or a currency, its an asset but the asset rules dont apply for exchange because its property... how hard is that to understand?

[21-Sep-18 12:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
we all understand it's theft

[21-Sep-18 12:22 PM] snowdamn#2414
don't worry

[21-Sep-18 12:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I choose to pay the full amount on capital gains, just to be sure. 2017 was the first year that I cashed out,  I could have tried paying 0 taxes, the amount cashed out was almost equal to what I put in the course of 4 years

[21-Sep-18 12:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
but I could have got too much attention and an audit

[21-Sep-18 12:24 PM] actionslacks#4072
price at time of trade. some asshole at a btc conference was telling me about it but yeah just take more of my money than you already take to feed those who hate me

[21-Sep-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I welcome an audit, I want them to spend 3 months going through my bot trades 😂

trollface (2) 

[21-Sep-18 12:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
@actionslacks did you mean "its not property or a currency, its an asset but the property rules dont apply for exchange because it's an asset" before or i didn't get it?

[21-Sep-18 12:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
you have to value it at face value per trade is a theory... so asset price at the moment of exchange... but if it os property that you held for 2+ years it should theoretically be exempt from cap gains. this has not been clarified and is a literal guess when filing

[21-Sep-18 12:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
I filed to the theory and didnt get shit fir it, ymmv

[21-Sep-18 12:29 PM] snowdamn#2414
oh, there's an exemption in US, didn't know 👍

[21-Sep-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and it's all because drug dealers never accept cash, only crypto 🙄

[21-Sep-18 12:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
tl;dr... US govt killed bittrex

[21-Sep-18 12:31 PM] snowdamn#2414
no, all cash is deposited to bank :trollface:

[21-Sep-18 12:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@actionslacks  `Today at 7:30 AM
tl;dr... US govt killed bittrex`
And 'trex turned around and thanked them for it 😣

[21-Sep-18 12:32 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  but I guess audit will like to see your bot trades on paper :trollface:  ?

[21-Sep-18 12:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
well ross ulbricht cut into CIA profits, probably saved countless lives from in person drug deals gone bad. see what happens?

[21-Sep-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
paper? what's that?

[21-Sep-18 12:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
the thing comming out of a printer

[21-Sep-18 12:33 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
in also

[21-Sep-18 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What's this "printer" thing you speak of? It sounds antiquated and I can't see why anyone would want one. 😕
Is it like a telegraph?

[21-Sep-18 12:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
and tether can print as much fake crypto as it wants and eviscerate financial fortunes at will...carry on

[21-Sep-18 12:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
the game is rigged my friends

[21-Sep-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Tether isn't fake, an undisclosed bank confirmed that they have an undisclosed amount of USD deposited in an undisclosed loation

[21-Sep-18 12:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
in Panama

[21-Sep-18 12:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
the location is disclosed

[21-Sep-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I must have missed that

[21-Sep-18 12:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
well Panama was a good spot for the btc mega pump but I'm sure they've moved by now

[21-Sep-18 12:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
but no sec on that deal

[21-Sep-18 12:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
and bitfinex is still a thing

[21-Sep-18 12:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
wild west for those above the law. we plebians must follow the rules though

[21-Sep-18 12:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
as convoluted and completely self contradicting as they are

[21-Sep-18 12:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I have $100 worth of eth 🤓

[21-Sep-18 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Every time I think about buying ETH, I get glad I didn't because it drops lower

[21-Sep-18 12:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
I bought a bunch of .eth domains with an old poloniex wallet. some pretty tasty ones actually... as much as I disparage their gas model, I secretly hope they figure it out.😏

[21-Sep-18 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've missed a few decent returns, but (on balance) my cowardice has worked well for me

[21-Sep-18 12:54 PM] actionslacks#4072
When another project allows me to trade assets and coins without a centralized exchange I will consider them as well

[21-Sep-18 12:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
most cex are going away soon I hope

[21-Sep-18 12:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nah, they will thin out, but I can't see them ever going away

[21-Sep-18 12:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
well the grandmas need to trade too but most kyc will stand for kill your customer at some point

[21-Sep-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CEXs are like banks in that the "average" person is easily willing to trade liberty and actual security for a perceived security through regulations (If you ever doubt that, see if you can get 100 people to attempt to take a 1 gallon jug of water onto an airplane)

[21-Sep-18 01:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah the trash bins at the tsa are always full

[21-Sep-18 01:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah the first generation born after 9/11 are now becoming adults. All they know is the gestapo police surveillance state.

[21-Sep-18 01:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think crypto will fuel the subculture of that though.

[21-Sep-18 01:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
