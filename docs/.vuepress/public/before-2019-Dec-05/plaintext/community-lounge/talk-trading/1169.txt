This was pretty interesting

[09-Oct-19 12:12 AM] tolken#2655
Lots of cool things brewing in Kmd land, AtomicDEX is the most tangible thing that anyone can use and experience the wow factor. All of the CryptoConditions stuff was generating a lot of buzz and there was that dungeon game.... then k64 entered the scene and for me at least sort of gave the impression it was the next iteration of ‚Äúblockchain enforced‚Äù gaming, but of course that‚Äôs a mess at the moment. When we see a game or something highly interactive on the blockchain, like some sort of game (maybe even the duneon one, but with a web interface, with the same ease of use as AtomicDex, I‚Äôd imagine Kmd  will get a lot of attention.

[09-Oct-19 12:14 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, and if Eth proves it can't scale under load again it could get dumped en-mass

[09-Oct-19 12:14 AM] JimD#9272
Not sure if Matic can save Eth or not

[09-Oct-19 12:14 AM] tolken#2655
The Kmd loans/pegs will be huge too.

KMD seems to already have everything together and built to annihilate Eth

[09-Oct-19 12:15 AM] JimD#9272
KMD has Hemp Coin too üòâ

Its interesting that if KMD main went tits up the chains created would still be viable on their own

[09-Oct-19 12:16 AM] tolken#2655
Unfortunately many platforms claim they do everything eth doesn‚Äôt. Now it‚Äôs time to demonstrate to the masses who can actually do it, rather than just talk.

[09-Oct-19 12:17 AM] JimD#9272
Do other chains run on KMD just have their own notary nodes ?

[09-Oct-19 12:17 AM] tolken#2655
AtomicDex is a great expression of what sets KMD apart.

[09-Oct-19 12:18 AM] JimD#9272
which means that KMD can associate with any other block chain at will.  I imagine that opens up a huge range of options when creating smart contracts and working between different ecosystems

How much demand for KMD  would there be if atomic dex was extremely successful

[09-Oct-19 12:49 AM] JimD#9272
and would there ever be KYC on it ?

[09-Oct-19 01:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomicdex is just one part of KMD demand , a necessary part but still just one part.  Kyc is the onus of the users behind the trades. To that end a filter system is being developed to allow people to be compliant but not force them to be so.

[09-Oct-19 01:02 AM] JimD#9272
interesting, atomic dex is going to be the standard for trading moving forward it looks like.  What would I use to trade with KMD dex right now if Im not in the atomic dex beta

[09-Oct-19 01:02 AM] JimD#9272
and is there a simple web client for this if I don't want to use my phone

[09-Oct-19 01:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes Hyperdex and Chainswap for desktop app

[09-Oct-19 01:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Web portal being worked on

[09-Oct-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
Ahh, was not seeing them in the main website

[09-Oct-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
could be missing something though

[09-Oct-19 01:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They too are in beta

[09-Oct-19 01:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just check their discord channels

[09-Oct-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
oh I see

#dex-hyperdex  and #chainmakers

[09-Oct-19 01:05 AM] JimD#9272
Ok, Ill have to check in there

[09-Oct-19 01:05 AM] JimD#9272
is there a way to get fiat onto them yet ?

[09-Oct-19 01:05 AM] JimD#9272
or I just need to show up with my BTC

[09-Oct-19 01:06 AM] allbits#5898
BTC is not a good coin to atomic swap with. BCH far better.

[09-Oct-19 01:06 AM] JimD#9272
BTC too slow ?

[09-Oct-19 01:07 AM] allbits#5898
Because of on chain transaction fees

[09-Oct-19 01:07 AM] allbits#5898
If fees are low in the moment and your trade is big enough, it's ok

[09-Oct-19 01:10 AM] JimD#9272
Ahh ok.  üëç

[09-Oct-19 01:14 AM] allbits#5898
I say BCH is a good option because on chain fees are low and fiat onramps are ubiquitous. For example, yesterday I bought BCH off bitcoin.com using a debit card. Then sent to atomicdex and bought KMD - clean and easy.

[09-Oct-19 01:15 AM] JimD#9272
Sounds like that Method avoids a lot of fees

[09-Oct-19 01:16 AM] JimD#9272
Coinbase is about 3% which is pretty disgusting

[09-Oct-19 01:16 AM] JimD#9272
A lot of the other DEXs Ive been looking at tonight seem pretty limited

Bigger lol at the retards who buy it

[09-Oct-19 03:25 AM] tolken#2655
@PTYX easier said than done, but when asked what sets AtomicDex apart, doesn‚Äôt seem like there was a clear answer other than Komodo has been doing it for a long time. Key points id reiterate - no KYC required, supports Eth, erc-20, most bitcoin protocol coins etc. Kadan knows this of course and I‚Äôve heard him articulate this clearly before, but sometimes hard to think on your toes I guess üòÉ need to nail down those talking points, that‚Äôs a softball waiting to be hit out of the park.

[09-Oct-19 03:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@tolken  what sets it apart currently :  Worlds only mobile cross chain atomic swap Dex .  Liquidity Multiplier to get more out of trading.   Future:  multi-ecosystem pegged coins ,  Selective trading filters,  private trading layer ( via pirate )

[09-Oct-19 03:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The multi ecosystem pegged coins and private trading layer will be hard for competitors to replicate

[09-Oct-19 04:39 AM] tolken#2655
True more great points. Let‚Äôs make up some flash cards for his next interview üòõ mm2 and AtomicDex, when people see how well it works, i think it has a serious chance of making a dent where others have failed.  I am concerned about the dex-cex liquidity solutions. They‚Äôre definitely something we need to take advantage of, but ultimately regulators will make it illegal. That said, it may just be a bit of a race. Once there‚Äôs sufficient dex liquidity, the cex interface /liquidity won‚Äôt be as necessary if at all.

Not using that stuff either though, but think that using more fintech will eventually make the step to crypto smaller
