There's no claim button on Verus Wallet. Just send to yourself, it works fine.

[13-Jul-19 01:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[13-Jul-19 01:35 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I made an internal wallet transfer, from one address I controlled to another in my wallet

[13-Jul-19 01:35 AM] meatspoon#7860
But that is kind of my point.  Agama in all of its forms is like a rat-rod vehicle.  "hey, man, gotta prime the engine with this lever, then make sure you dont hit that button... but we make the best cars!!"

[13-Jul-19 01:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Interest tossed into the void

[13-Jul-19 01:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
its a bad look.  Everyone in here is like "1/tech, Duuuuude!" but the wallets are dogshit

[13-Jul-19 01:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
you cant have a coin that you claim is madly superior to everything and not have a container that can reliably hold that coin according to the whitepaper.

[13-Jul-19 01:38 AM] meatspoon#7860
My shit has been on Binance since the hack.  And the irony in this room is that everyone is like, "Not your keys, not your crypto!!" but exchanges are proven to be more safe than official KMD wallets

[13-Jul-19 01:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they coins are just held by the private key... And if you know wht youir doing you dont put those into anything 😄

[13-Jul-19 01:38 AM] meatspoon#7860
dogshit wallets

[13-Jul-19 01:39 AM] yorklab#7270
The hack created a temporary issue. It is a little messy at the moment but it will improve.

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I peice of paper is safeer than any wallet... and ledger 🤷

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] meatspoon#7860
i used to play a game in college where we would take an old wallet, fill the pocket with dogshit and mash it down.... then you take a tear off of a $20 bill, and place that so its peeking out of the wallet.  You leave it on the sidewalk.  and you watch.  people walk by, pick up the wallet, dig their fingers into it hoping for cash and get dog shit on their fingers

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
if your kmd is already on binance, maybe you should sell the antara release, if there's a spike.

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] meatspoon#7860
we called it "Poo Wallet"

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
meatspoons being kinda harsh, and hes wrong about the "safety" of CEX wallets, but we definitely need new wallets eith less bugs and a much much nicer gui

[13-Jul-19 01:40 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
current gui looks like shit

[13-Jul-19 01:41 AM] meatspoon#7860
the best part about Poo Wallet is that after a victim sticks his/her/zer fingers in the wallet and feels poo, they drop it and the Poo Wallet is still in play.  But Agama is different.

[13-Jul-19 01:43 AM] meatspoon#7860
i am just so sick of the fanbois in here felating KMD, saying its tech is 100x superior to every other project.... yet there is no wallet that can hold it safely or handle its reward protocol.  fuuuuuuck

[13-Jul-19 01:43 AM] meatspoon#7860
its just soooo tech-powerful, bro!  no wallet can handle it!

```Winning: The Antara Module
comming to a blockchain near you
Where we are going we dont need wallets```

[13-Jul-19 01:50 AM] meatspoon#7860
@FlyingDutchman  Agreed on all points (including me being harsh).  But I don't think I am empirically wrong saying that CEX's that support KMD have been historically more trustworthy than wallets that support KMD.  And if that is accurate, that is a fucked up fact about the project with the "best tech" and "best security".  Pfffft.

[13-Jul-19 01:52 AM] meatspoon#7860
one cant expect mass adoption if the average Joe can not secure his hard earned money/fiat/KMD.  In fact, one can expect the opposite of mass adoption if funds remain non-safu.

[13-Jul-19 01:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I haven’t tried OceanQT for KMD

[13-Jul-19 01:55 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just pirateocean

[13-Jul-19 01:57 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’ll just roll with that

[13-Jul-19 01:58 AM] meatspoon#7860
Good luck, bro.  Even pirate vessels get raided from time to time.

[13-Jul-19 02:01 AM] Caglio#3337
Hahahaha @meatspoon some nice points there

[13-Jul-19 02:02 AM] Caglio#3337
Tech tech tech

[13-Jul-19 02:02 AM] Caglio#3337
But fucking wallet sucks

[13-Jul-19 02:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@meatspoon just use a ledger

{Reactions}
💯 

[13-Jul-19 02:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no reason not to, you can claim your rewards on it with 0% fee and if you every lose it, just use the 24 words and get it working again.

[13-Jul-19 02:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No need to worry about the wallet.dat being deleted or backed up without the right addresses and no need to worry about being hacked

[13-Jul-19 02:12 AM] Alecandro#1179
Ledger is def the way to go

[13-Jul-19 02:13 AM] meatspoon#7860
@hyperDEX  Thanks and I agree.  I just think that a top 50 CMC project which claims to have the best tech should also have a secure and user-friendly wallet.  Adoption will not happen otherwise, no matter how hard people wish it to (read: marketing!!!).

[13-Jul-19 02:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
sounds familiar

[13-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah meatspoon is totally right

[13-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Caglio#3337
The best project ever cant make a working wallet ?

[13-Jul-19 02:14 AM] meatspoon#7860
(I was being facetious/ironic with the marketing comment)

[13-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Caglio#3337
What in the dead fuck ?

☠ 

[13-Jul-19 02:16 AM] meatspoon#7860
and @hyperDEX , ledger's are not a super attractive solution for newcomers to the space.  If we want to encourage people to dip their toes in the pool, the pool has to be safe and affordable.  Suggesting that newcomers who are interested in KMD need to buy an expensive hardware wallet... ouch

[13-Jul-19 02:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If you store a private key on a windows machine, it deosnt matter how pretty the wallet is, its not safe

[13-Jul-19 02:19 AM] meatspoon#7860
Then why does KMD's website direct people to install windows versions of wallets that are unsafe?

[13-Jul-19 02:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@meatspoon if they have under $1000 and cannot afford a ledger, they would not be the target of a hacker.

[13-Jul-19 02:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Anything over $1000 worth of crypto they should invest in a $100 device

[13-Jul-19 02:20 AM] meatspoon#7860
i kind of agree, hyper.  but I also think that different people have different risk profiles

[13-Jul-19 02:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure, DP using agama with 450k KMD is not good.

[13-Jul-19 02:21 AM] meatspoon#7860
and if KMD's stance is, "you're on your own, kid!  none of our wallets are safe!"  then they should say that and stop talking about how they are super techy and safe

[13-Jul-19 02:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No they are taking the safe approach of making sure it is now that this problem has come to light

[13-Jul-19 02:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
dude are you here to fud or what @meatspoon?

[13-Jul-19 02:22 AM] meatspoon#7860
but Hollow is saying that Versus Agama (which was officially reccomeneded) does not distribute rewards correctly

[13-Jul-19 02:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So yes, they need to fix the issue, but it takes time, with the hardfork and rebrand, that needs to wait.

[13-Jul-19 02:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Meatfish i dont know, there are others that said it did.

[13-Jul-19 02:22 AM] meatspoon#7860
@actionslacks  No.  But i am a sassy bastard

[13-Jul-19 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So he needs to go through the same process as everyone, did the rewards work, from memory it did.

[13-Jul-19 02:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
and to troubleshoot it.

[13-Jul-19 02:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But for now, the safest option is ledger for a newbie. I got the rewards working with the ledger for this specific purpose.

[13-Jul-19 02:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
1/tech applies because every other project's wallet does 1 fucking coin. and most of those are erc 20 tokens whose wallet code can be copy/pasted off of github anyway.

[13-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
0.5.6a (verus agama) does have a claim rewards button FYI

[13-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’m looking at it

[13-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I just had some more rewards generate

[13-Jul-19 02:30 AM] meatspoon#7860
make sure you dont erroneously send them to miners when trying to claim them, hollow

[13-Jul-19 02:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
0.5.7.3 is the latest @Hollowman9000

[13-Jul-19 02:30 AM] meatspoon#7860
that would be a flaw in the BEST TECH EVER

[13-Jul-19 02:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I won’t hit the claim button because I still have my old compromised address in my address list

[13-Jul-19 02:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But I’ll send the balance to myself manually

[13-Jul-19 02:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586

"manually send it to yourself, newb".... adoption!

[13-Jul-19 02:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you dont take some personal responsibility, dont claim the reward.

[13-Jul-19 02:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Waiting for confirmation

[13-Jul-19 02:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It takes less than a minute to figure it out and no one said this is the end result. Team is evaluating what to do next (im not privy to these discussions). Let's give them time to do the hardfork/rebrand then see what happens.

[13-Jul-19 02:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
i dont think there are kmd fanboys. eos has fanboys. kmd has nerds

[13-Jul-19 02:35 AM] meatspoon#7860
Hey, hey, I agree.  Everyone calm down your nipples.  I am just trying offer a contrarian opinion... which at times seems very needed in this room

[13-Jul-19 02:35 AM] meatspoon#7860
and... fix the fucking wallets... please

[13-Jul-19 02:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Can we give them a bit of space to complete the hardfork and rebrand first? There is a temp solution, lets wait for the final one.

[13-Jul-19 02:36 AM] meatspoon#7860
@Deleted User BEST TECH

[13-Jul-19 02:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586

I’ll try the updated verus agama

[13-Jul-19 02:37 AM] meatspoon#7860
I am Meme'n...  but seriously, many people have said "best tech"
