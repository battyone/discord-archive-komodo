Damn that‚Äôs wild

[16-Jul-19 02:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Q is who the f unloads 100k at these prices ü§∑

[16-Jul-19 02:35 PM] jansako#3330
someone who was betting on sell the news/pre-rebrand pump & now they are cutting their losses. or taking profit if they bought sub-10

[16-Jul-19 02:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Guess so

[16-Jul-19 02:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[16-Jul-19 02:37 PM] Alecandro#1179

yeah possibly someone that bought at lower and solidifying a gain

[16-Jul-19 02:41 PM] Markus#5464
or another whale is not happy with his bag and want price to go down

[16-Jul-19 02:42 PM] Neko#5830
antara is very unique, kmd is a strong coin and also a privacy coin, very interesting

[16-Jul-19 02:43 PM] Sherdogz#6731
Or the hacker:troll_thuglife:

[16-Jul-19 02:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What we need to do now everyone is talk about how much better a "Smart chain" is than using an erc20 alternative. Security , Scalability and interoperability . If we want to see KMD rise to eth levels people need to understand what we have here. The new documentation that has been released will help with that also. but as a community we need to spread the word üëç üöÄ :Komodo:

many i have talked to only care about gains not tech

[16-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Neko#5830
tech bring gains

[16-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Markus#5464
thats why those ppl will come when gains already came and buy the top

[16-Jul-19 02:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yes there is alot only care about price thats right. But eth didnt get to its highs on jus speculation. countless erc20 tokens were released which created demand. Now we have the tech to make countless projects in mins that are way more advanced than an ERC20 token.

[16-Jul-19 02:52 PM] Neko#5830
but is it as easy to create as an erc20 token

[16-Jul-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
Eth however made demand cause u had to pay eth as fee

[16-Jul-19 02:52 PM] Markus#5464
kmd dont

[16-Jul-19 02:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That has been discussed many times over. The more projects in the eco system will create natural demand for kmd without forcing essentially a "tax" to use

[16-Jul-19 02:53 PM] Markus#5464
Yes i know, im not against it just saying it was a quick demand feature by them

[16-Jul-19 02:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yeah for sure we all know the gas model isnt needed

[16-Jul-19 02:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
its just creates demand but it inst required really

[16-Jul-19 02:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
People have already created smart chains in <5mins since yesterday

[16-Jul-19 02:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Compare that to a badly written smart contract that requires a 3rd party to review etc

[16-Jul-19 02:56 PM] JimD#9272
How does the new release hook into Amazon

[16-Jul-19 02:57 PM] JimD#9272
Can people set up their environments, create a blockchain and then push transactions just by going through AWS?

Not sure on the last point Jim so ill let someone who does know answer. But i believe the create a smart chain feature ties in with having AWS nodes immediately on creation

[16-Jul-19 02:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Jep

[16-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And the dpow options etc are paid to CRYPTO iirc, which needs to be converted into kmd in order for the dividends to pay out

[16-Jul-19 03:00 PM] JimD#9272
Ok thanks, AWS is a huge market though Im not sure how many people are actively incorporating blockchain into their applications

[16-Jul-19 03:02 PM] JimD#9272

[16-Jul-19 03:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Although kmd itself isnt incorporated and completely decentralized

[16-Jul-19 03:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So doesnt really have an address

[16-Jul-19 03:05 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, lots of freelance WFH types in crypto land

[16-Jul-19 03:12 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Did you see that guys tweet yesterday saying something like he reckons kmd exit scammed and showed a note saying kmdplatform dissolved ?

[16-Jul-19 03:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
dont know where they make that stuff up ü§£

[16-Jul-19 03:13 PM] JimD#9272
WTF, KMD is pretty much as far as you can get from an exit scam at this point

I suspect when there are some web based dapps that leverage a kmd chain/Antara, particularly if its a game of some sort, it‚Äôll be a big ah-ha moment for many people. Antara looks very sexy for devs, but to the general crypto gambler, it still isn‚Äôt obvious what Kmd can do,

[16-Jul-19 04:44 PM] tolken#2655
I realize devs were the primary target for this wave of marketing, just an observation.

I imagine a dapp where you ‚Äúinsert coin‚Äù (like bitcoin, ether etc) and then you‚Äôre permitted to play a game. That high level, low-friction example of what‚Äôs possible seems like it would resonate with a lot of people.
