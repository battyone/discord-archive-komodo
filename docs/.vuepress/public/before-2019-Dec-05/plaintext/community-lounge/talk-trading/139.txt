Is that kyc or just cash out?

[07-Sep-18 10:49 PM] jspook16#3059
cash out up to 900 with just phone number

[07-Sep-18 10:49 PM] jspook16#3059
up to 3k with kyc (state id and phone number)

[07-Sep-18 10:50 PM] jspook16#3059
there is a one hour limit per transaction but i dont know if its based on phone number or receive address

[07-Sep-18 10:50 PM] jspook16#3059
but still .....the fact that a person can be-bop to the nearest coinflip machine and either buy or sell KMD is big i think

[07-Sep-18 10:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lifetime?

[07-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Burner phones are cheap and can be considered the cost of doing business

[07-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
900/ph# if lifetime

[07-Sep-18 10:59 PM] jspook16#3059
per hour is what i gather

[07-Sep-18 10:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Oh snap

[07-Sep-18 11:00 PM] jspook16#3059

[07-Sep-18 11:02 PM] jspook16#3059
lol my point is that it is now easily accessible, especially to folks that arent too crypto savvy

[07-Sep-18 11:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
That was uh.. my point too

[07-Sep-18 11:02 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

KMD looking nice on the weekly

[08-Sep-18 01:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
how many of you go all in on KMD? üòÑ

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] jspook16#3059
#metoo

[08-Sep-18 01:10 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
lol

[08-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I believe KMD is closer to satoshi vision then other projects

[08-Sep-18 01:11 AM] jspook16#3059
and then some

[08-Sep-18 01:11 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
exactly

[08-Sep-18 01:12 AM] jspook16#3059
right now its in the "UFO" phase....technology so advanced its not comprehended by the community....shoot I dont even fully understand 100%

[08-Sep-18 01:13 AM] jspook16#3059
i just know its special..

[08-Sep-18 01:14 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the biggest whale number one knows it too

[08-Sep-18 01:15 AM] jspook16#3059
The RD7..Pi whale?

[08-Sep-18 01:16 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
yeap, that's the one

[08-Sep-18 01:16 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah the rewards he's reaping are massive

[08-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so far he hasn't claimed any rewards though

[08-Sep-18 01:17 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so wondering what's up

[08-Sep-18 01:17 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah i guess i never saw a rewards transaction in the history

[08-Sep-18 01:18 AM] jspook16#3059
im not sure whats up....that much in one address, transparent...no rewards

[08-Sep-18 01:18 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
some people said it's exchange cold wallet, but I doubt it, because the biggest exchange is binance and that's not binance wallet i think

[08-Sep-18 01:19 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
but only the whale knows haha

[08-Sep-18 01:19 AM] jspook16#3059
maybe its vitalik

[08-Sep-18 01:20 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Someone with lots of money is banking on KMD to be the big thing at some point.

[08-Sep-18 01:23 AM] jspook16#3059
if you think about it its a really good bet ....once we get out of the bear market  KMD can claim a top ten spot ...if december was any indication of the price KMD can achieve....

[08-Sep-18 01:24 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
kmd momentum is so great, if you are in this field for a while, you'll know it.

[08-Sep-18 01:25 AM] jspook16#3059
yes...CC contracts are going to be a game changer....and I dont fully understand them yet

[08-Sep-18 01:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
KMD is so ahead in many areas and other prominent crypto speakers don't want to talk about it.

[08-Sep-18 01:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
because they don't have any stake in KMD so far

[08-Sep-18 01:26 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah i saw a video where they compared it to eth and stated it was just trying to copy what eth had done

[08-Sep-18 01:27 AM] jspook16#3059
but i think its far from that.

[08-Sep-18 01:27 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
sometimes it's hard teach old dog new tricks

[08-Sep-18 01:28 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I notice that more and more people are experimenting with CC , that's really cool. I might find sometimes to play around as well

[08-Sep-18 01:28 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah .... we should keep building our stashes in the mean time

Amazon is looking to sink UPS in the US

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
launching a franchised delivery service of sorts

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] jspook16#3059
yep 10k to start i think

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] jspook16#3059
you gonna get in on that?

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Lucrative enough that it has me thinking

[08-Sep-18 03:26 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yup

[08-Sep-18 03:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It means I become the beast though

[08-Sep-18 03:27 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Though they have the habit of luring you in and then chopping your head off

[08-Sep-18 03:27 AM] jspook16#3059
10k isnt bad for a franchise oppurtunity though

[08-Sep-18 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That‚Äôs very base level

[08-Sep-18 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
1 truck I believe

[08-Sep-18 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But

[08-Sep-18 03:28 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It‚Äôs just getting started

[08-Sep-18 03:28 AM] jspook16#3059
oh its 10k per truck?

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You have to find reliable people

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not sure

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Someone showed me the site today

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll look into it tomorrow

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
3 week training (indoctrination) course

[08-Sep-18 03:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Etc

[08-Sep-18 03:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Too intoxicated to research it seriously at the moment

[08-Sep-18 03:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tbh

[08-Sep-18 03:30 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah im sure it involves dedicating time to it

[08-Sep-18 03:31 AM] jspook16#3059
I've kept it on my radar last few days

[08-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bezos is bordering on anti-trust action imo

[08-Sep-18 03:31 AM] jspook16#3059
copy that

[08-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Especially with Trump in office

[08-Sep-18 03:32 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They don‚Äôt care much for each other :abusedsmily:

[08-Sep-18 03:34 AM] jspook16#3059
better off getting a "pollos hermanos"

[08-Sep-18 03:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It will require beefing up their distribution center network

[08-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I assume they‚Äôll contract out to private rigs to haul between centers

[08-Sep-18 03:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
The money (and competition) will be at the population centers, as always

[08-Sep-18 03:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Bezos is the antichrist, isn‚Äôt he?

[08-Sep-18 03:45 AM] jspook16#3059
im not sure but i heard the workplace sucks

[08-Sep-18 03:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
We‚Äôll be marked on the right hand or forehead with an amazon public key, without it we can do no business

[08-Sep-18 03:45 AM] jspook16#3059
