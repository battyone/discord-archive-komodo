11-10k just seems to be support

[09-Jul-19 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i have some bad news

[09-Jul-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
we have too much tech coming out and not enough testers. there is the prices CC (bitmex type functionality), we also have nSPV and just got a pegs CC release that implements a KMD backed stablecoin, also it seems we will soon have a CHIPS GUI

[09-Jul-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
looking for some cli testers

[09-Jul-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
pegs and prices are somewhat trading related

[09-Jul-19 03:21 PM] allbits#5898
What should I test?

[09-Jul-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
either prices CC or pegs CC, it will be much harder to test than nSPV. probably pegs CC is best as it is fundamentally a stablecoin, though it is achieved via decentralized process and the game theory that people like free money

[09-Jul-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
#cc-pegs and #cc-prices, though the prices chain i think had some issues, i pushed a recent bug fix that should help it

[09-Jul-19 03:26 PM] Markus#5464
Will bitmex like functionality be added to AtomicDex later on? or maybe it dont fit the concept?

[09-Jul-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC is a standalone thing. it would be possible once we get mobile CC working

[09-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Markus#5464
Alright

[09-Jul-19 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits first step with pegs is to understand its mechanism

[09-Jul-19 03:34 PM] Malti#3948
KMD bad tech news = too much tech to test

[09-Jul-19 03:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i heard this month there should be poker GUI working

[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
prices has a gui, but more for testing than for end user. pegs is cli only, you can borrow against your KMD in stable coins

[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then if the market goes your way, you can borrow more

[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] p.#1126
The SWC model is great and underrated imo, an upgraded versionnof that would be rock solid

[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] jl777c#5810
if the market goes against you, anybody else can liquidate your position and get some free arbitrage

[09-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
what will price CC bitmex like max leverage be?

[09-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
and how many different pairs will there be?

[09-Jul-19 03:38 PM] Markus#5464
also is it only for crypto or also other assets like gold?

[09-Jul-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it is very configurable. you can set it up for stocks, cryptos, maybe even gold index, not sure the complete list. would be good to have somebody up to speed on all the possible symbols that are already supported. max leverage is tunable setting

[09-Jul-19 03:41 PM] Markus#5464
alright sounds cool

[09-Jul-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be good to have somebody push on progressing the prices CC, it really is a pretty cool setup

I asked me how it is possible...we have a daily volume of 280 btc and only 40btc need to reach 20k but we are still at 12k

To be honest...astrophysic is much easier than understanding the crytomarket

[09-Jul-19 04:58 PM] c2k#4915
probably as crypto moves on money and emotion...nothing else

`we have a daily volume of 280 btc and only 40btc need to reach 20k but we are still at 12k`  . Volume includes buying & selling

[09-Jul-19 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1 Btc worth bought
2 BTC worth sold
.5 BTC worth bought
1 BTC worth bought
total volume: 1+2+0.5+1 = 4.5 BTC

Just keep the market movements in perspective. a 20BTC buy or sell in either direction changes the market 10%.

Try buying 1M komodos and not move the price, selling 1M komodos will take us down to 2k or something silly

Why is there only a USD/KMD trading pair on Bittrex

[10-Jul-19 01:55 AM] JimD#9272
why would they not have a BTC/KMD pair

[10-Jul-19 02:03 AM] yorklab#7270
Bittrex does have a BTC/KMD pair.

Don't say Binance

[10-Jul-19 02:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
coinbase then binance

[10-Jul-19 02:27 AM] JimD#9272
Ahh Coinbase is probably a better option

[10-Jul-19 02:28 AM] JimD#9272
didn't realize they have QNT on Coinbase too.....

[10-Jul-19 02:28 AM] JimD#9272
really missed the boat on that one

[10-Jul-19 02:30 AM] bishop#9773
@JimD you probably didn't see it on trex because they break their markets up by base pairs
