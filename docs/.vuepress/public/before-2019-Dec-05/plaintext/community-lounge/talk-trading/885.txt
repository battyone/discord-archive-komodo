As long as they pay a fee its ok no?

[03-Jul-19 09:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think the ponlem is that trx count is not the only metric that should count

[03-Jul-19 09:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
tx count does not equal utility

[03-Jul-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
comparing tx activity for different protocols is almost nonsensical

[03-Jul-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
only within the same protocol family would it be comparable

[03-Jul-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
also, this doesnt count all the ecosystem activity, which for a komodo ecosystem usage would seem to need

[03-Jul-19 10:30 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So i guess thats why they claim bch to be 2nd then as its a btc clone. makes sense then

[03-Jul-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and ignore KMD, of course

[03-Jul-19 10:31 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Obviously yeah thats common practice now :troll_cool:

Barry Silbert predicted that bitcoin develops through 5 stages. 
Stage four is called Wall Street, where traditional financial business elites in the east of the United States are calling Bitcoin. the period over which an bitcoin is recognized as an asset and the related product is created. Financial Times, which has faithfully represented mainstream economists' skepticism about Bitcoin, Recently, there was a positive report about Bitcoin. Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also said that because of Facebook's Libra, central banks are rushing to issue digital currency.

[03-Jul-19 11:38 AM] Markus#5464
central banks are scams

[03-Jul-19 11:38 AM] Markus#5464

blocktivity is made to make steem, bts and eos look good with lots of fake transactions or at least useless transactions

[03-Jul-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the protocol is very different

[03-Jul-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
also ETH, updating contract stats is counted as a transaction

Part of the reason alts exploded in the last run was that the BTC network for clogged with fees and poor performance

[03-Jul-19 12:30 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

I remember back in the day no one believed LTC would rally

[03-Jul-19 12:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
LTC did lower lows on the first stages of btc rallies

[03-Jul-19 12:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Later came xmr, dash and eth

[03-Jul-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
No one believed those coins would moon if btc rallied

[03-Jul-19 12:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
As with all things

[03-Jul-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Same thing, at first stage they did lower lows
