Today is 15x price rise. For long hodlers. If they had bought it at 10 cents.

[20-Jul-18 09:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And fantastic opportunity to buy some KMD for new ones to get some precious KMD at cheap rates.

I'm instead happy that more people will get their hands on KMD since smart investors wait patiently for right price as per their mind and then get some.

The way to live that way is to plan ahead and live responsibly.

I'm a full time dev who only lives on crypto for daily expenses. I need to cash out my crypto to pay my weekly rent and have my groceries bought to have a decent meal.
I don't think it'd be more urgent need for anybody else who thinks price going down for KMD is bad.

it's called prism.

you can use BarterDEX for that too. üôÇ

@meatspoon probably late to the convo, but what have you done to increase the price of your investment? I would also ask the same questions to the KMD whales that sold their notary votes for rev share.

[21-Jul-18 01:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is a open source project, people are responsible for their choice of investment. If you see that things are not done to your liking, what are YOU personally doing to help?

[21-Jul-18 01:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Are you out there advocating on twitter / bitcointalk / reddit / discord? Or are you complaining to get a response then sit on your hands till the price bottoms again?

[21-Jul-18 01:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you can code - help with the code.
If you cant code and have some funds - donate/fund projects built on KMD.
If you cant code and dont have spare funds - donate your time for these projects being built on KMD.
If you cant code, dont have spare funds and have no time - Sit on your ass and pray that others will do the above to increase your investment. Then complain when it doesnt moon 10x today.

I don‚Äôt recall seeing it

[21-Jul-18 01:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There is another option I usually give if someone asks me. Don't buy a cryptocurrency if you don't believe in it. That goes to KMD too.

[21-Jul-18 01:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And it's OK to buy it on high price when you believe in it.

[21-Jul-18 01:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[21-Jul-18 01:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If short holder, shuffle as per market. And not be emotional. 
If long holder, then stick to your long term hodl. Only change strategy if that project isn't really going nowhere. Like BTCD. :trollface:

[21-Jul-18 01:48 AM] meatspoon#7860
@hyperDEX  As I mentioned before, I scaled into KMD with several buys over months, I chatted up my (few) crypto pals about it, I mined KMD for several months and then I attempted to participate in the BarterDex Beer swap which was a shitshow.  I have alpha and beta tested software, and the BarterDex Beer swap brought back memories.  Not good ones.  Concurrently the price was plummeting which made mining incredibly unprofitable relative to other options.  All the while I saw a complete lack of marketing with only promises to fix it (for months), I saw KMD announcements about hiring people who only had first names (read: no verifiable identity) and didn't have public resumes, the Agama wallet continued to be a cumbersome tribute to what I might call an art style of GUI Brutalism.  So I researched a lot, bought some, mined some, talked it up to friends when I was intrigued by it.  Perhaps that is not enough in your opinion.  Shrug.  Maybe you think that investing/speculating/mining to secure the network might not be enough, and if so, I didn't do enough, comrade.

[21-Jul-18 01:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@meatspoon If the marketing is so bad how about offering suggestions on how to make it better, why not find other people that are doing great marketing and suggesting that to the team?

[21-Jul-18 01:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I have been here for close to 4 years, i have seen the ups and downs. I saw there was a gap in the GUI for regular users and  put my time and money into fixing that hole. This included bringing on devs from outside to make sure we make it as good as we can, whilst having fresh eyes on the code base.

@Kitchen Table  5 on first 15 on 2nd 10 on 3rd

[21-Jul-18 02:00 AM] meatspoon#7860
I have made my opinions clear here.  They seem to be opinions that have been voiced before.  No one seems to argue against the assertion that KMD has a huge marketing deficiency.  I noted earlier, if you Google KMD or YouTube it, the results are mostly poor quality ramblings by people who cant adequately explain the tech.   And even when I voice concerns here, I just have long-timers telling me I just don't understand the tech like they do, but they are unable or unwilling to actually explain it.  So Google searches don't do KMD justice, YouTube searches result in a bunch of speculative people that can't explain the inherent value it it, and here on Discord critical voices are shouted down as being trolls or whatever.

I am not looking for a hobby.   I don't want to contribute my time or capital to BTC, ETH, LTC, XLM, KMD or any of the other projects/coins I own.  I am not a boy scout, I am an investor.  KMD has disappointed me with their lack of marketing, transparency, ability launch projects, the half baked nature of the Beer swap.  Its just my opinion.  I still root for KMD because I own it, but I am a disappointed investor who wants to be heard and instead of saying, "I hear your concerns and they are valid," most of the KMD people in this thread want to call me a troll or whatever.  This is an echo chamber in here.

[21-Jul-18 02:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Then all i can say is that, if you dont think they can turn it around, best to sell now before it does to 1 sat like hollowman likes to say

[21-Jul-18 02:06 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD is a ambitious project. It will take many many iterations to make what we have use friendly enough for grandma. Until that point it is hard to market. Marketing for vaporware is easy, it works 100%. Marketing for a POC is not easy, it can fail.

[21-Jul-18 02:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The same short term and long term text of mine is reply to above.

[21-Jul-18 02:09 AM] yorklab#7270
@meatspoon as I said, others have pointed out similar areas that need improvement. The team heard and change is on the way, probably not quick enough for many, but it's in process.

MM 1.0 that powers barterDEX and hyperDEX is not ready for a huge marketing campaign. It works if you use command line and know what you are doing, If you are using the GUI it works sometimes and not others. This is the whole reason why MM 2.0 is being made. It is taking this POC and making sure all the usability/network issues are address for mass consumption.

[21-Jul-18 02:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Being investor either you can help somehow, or just move your risk to less risky investment.

[21-Jul-18 02:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
How you evaluate your risk on your investment is your evaluation.

Well I know years in advance sometimes when a new game is in development because the company teases it and advertises what they are working on.  I have seen some improvements in marketing but not much.  They have a strategy albeit a strange one but time will tell.

[21-Jul-18 07:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also colored coins and James hinted at an onchain dex feature might be possible.  Also more specialized coins are at risk .  Eventually someone will replace factom as it's cheaper to piggyback than to go straight to btc,  I see similar fate for waves , salt,  and a variety of gaming coins to name a few
