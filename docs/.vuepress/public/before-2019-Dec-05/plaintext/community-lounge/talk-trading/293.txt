I deleted like 300 persons from twitter due the stuff they posted

[20-Nov-18 09:08 AM] Sdunbar#5064
i didnt really buy much LTC though

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Caglio#3337
I just have LTC and KMD

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The litecoin spam?

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah it‚Äôs a lot.

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm mostly KMD myself.   And pirate but that‚Äôs because I am biased.

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Caglio#3337
Pirate is cool, I dont have any tho cos I am too retarded to understand how to get it

[20-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Caglio#3337
I just have kmd on agama mobile wallet

[20-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Caglio#3337
I tried to add other coins into it, and almost fucked up my wallet üòÑ

[20-Nov-18 09:10 AM] Caglio#3337
Now I dont try anymore ^^

[20-Nov-18 09:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Haha.   What version of Agama do you have?

[20-Nov-18 09:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you use native or lite mode for KMD?

[20-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I'm like 90%+ KMD haha

[20-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Caglio#3337
I really dont know the difference

[20-Nov-18 09:11 AM] Caglio#3337
I am not sure there is a difference in android wallet ?

[20-Nov-18 09:11 AM] FishyGuts#5085
When you open your wallet... do you type 24 words or does it start right away?

[20-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Caglio#3337
digits

[20-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Caglio#3337
6 digits

[20-Nov-18 09:12 AM] PHBA2061#2530
since it's on mobile it is likely a lite version

[20-Nov-18 09:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Mobile wallet?  Ok.

[20-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, the oldest one I guess, I remember finding it over reddit kmd page

[20-Nov-18 09:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate can‚Äôt get on mobile wallets yet.   
It‚Äôs on the list but the private transactions are difficult for computers.   We think Q2 2019 for a pirate mobile / lite wallet.

[20-Nov-18 09:14 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôll get you here and you can use this wallet until we get mobile wallet support for users like you.

[20-Nov-18 09:14 AM] Caglio#3337
Oh I see, thank you, then I wasnt the problem üòÑ

Dang.  That‚Äôs ok.  Thanks for lookin @Seko

[20-Nov-18 09:19 AM] Caglio#3337
Anyway, is komodo going to change name?

[20-Nov-18 09:20 AM] Caglio#3337
Cos I actually like it like this :/

[20-Nov-18 09:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Caglio are there any specific social media sites with a crypto focus that are Croatian focused or Croatian only?

[20-Nov-18 09:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
What are the main forms of social media in your country?

[20-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Caglio#3337
Croatians use Facebook

[20-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Caglio#3337
and Instagram

[20-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Caglio#3337
And about social media sites about crypto

[20-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Caglio#3337
We probably have some but nothing in particular crosses my mind now

[20-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Caglio#3337
Most of those sites we had

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
were sited made for certain people to profit

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
for example some guy made a guide how to buy crypto

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
and put his referal links inside

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
stuff like that

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
our newspapers sometimes write about it, but its mostly when something big happens, for example last years boom

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
and this years price drop

[20-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Caglio#3337
one of the most popular coins in my city ( cos I know few miners ) is certainly ETN

[20-Nov-18 09:24 AM] Caglio#3337
And I always hate talks about it

[20-Nov-18 09:24 AM] Caglio#3337
However I had a nice idea how to advertise Komodo

[20-Nov-18 09:24 AM] Caglio#3337
But like I said, maybe we should wait for a rebrand

[20-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Caglio#3337
I actually think that could get a price pump, I mean I am pretty sure it will pump the price, and not just pump n dump, but pump for real

[20-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Caglio#3337
Here is me blabbering again ( :

[20-Nov-18 09:28 AM] P3L3#1096
Hello,
We do have a few web sites involved in crypto education and we do have non profit a blockchain and cryptocurrency association aimed to gather projects and educate accordingly

[20-Nov-18 09:31 AM] P3L3#1096
Now, the Balkan region is a whole different story. You all kno wwhat Slovenia does and Serbia is not far away as well.
These are all former Yu republic with similar languages and understanding.

[20-Nov-18 09:33 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah Slovenia is strong in Crypto world

[20-Nov-18 09:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If your miner friends like ETN for privacy then they will love pirate.   Send them our way to mine as much as possible before the halving.

[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate.black the website has all they would need to get started.

[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Equihash so GPU and asic friendly.

[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Caglio#3337
I have no idea why they mine ETN to be honest, but I will tell them, thanks ( :

[20-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Caglio#3337
I didnt even know ETN is a privacy coin

[20-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Caglio#3337
All I know is they repeat how you can pay bills in UK with it, which I think its a bullshit

[20-Nov-18 09:36 AM] PHBA2061#2530
ETN is a fork from Monero, to be exact

[20-Nov-18 09:36 AM] PHBA2061#2530
but you have to do kyc in order to spend them, which is weird

[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Well I had no idea about that

[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Another question

[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
KYC means your giving up your privacy.....

[20-Nov-18 09:37 AM] Caglio#3337
Do you guys remember a coin named Dash ?

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
To uses privacy coin.

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes lol did it die yet?

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Caglio#3337
Haha I have no idea

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I had very nice return buying etn ICO

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Caglio#3337
I wanted to ask you what is happening with it

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Don‚Äôt know.  I don‚Äôt follow dash.

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] PHBA2061#2530
Dash yes, ofc, it is still ahead of kmd in term of marker cap lol

[20-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Caglio#3337
It used to be really strong coin, and I even remember they sponsored Bellator figter Rory McDonald

[20-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Caglio#3337
But noone ever talks about it anymore

[20-Nov-18 09:40 AM] P3L3#1096

I never tried to send komodo using a privacy mode

[20-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Caglio#3337
I understand those are some Z wallets ?

[20-Nov-18 09:45 AM] PHBA2061#2530
Z address

[20-Nov-18 09:46 AM] PHBA2061#2530
T address are transparent and Z  are private

[20-Nov-18 09:46 AM] Caglio#3337
So is there a possibility to have a Z address in agama mobile wallet ?

[20-Nov-18 09:46 AM] Caglio#3337

[20-Nov-18 09:46 AM] Caglio#3337

ltc 30

[20-Nov-18 09:49 AM] dokrates#8987
me too

[20-Nov-18 09:49 AM] Caglio#3337
I remember when I first got into crypto

[20-Nov-18 09:49 AM] Caglio#3337
Ltc was like 35$ back then

[20-Nov-18 09:50 AM] Caglio#3337
I went to a bank to deposit money, and get it on coinbase

[20-Nov-18 09:50 AM] Caglio#3337
Over SEPA transfer... deposited 1000 euros ( which is like I said over 2 paychecks of mine )

[20-Nov-18 09:51 AM] Caglio#3337
Somehow, a women in a bank did that in HRK ( croatian currency ), even tho SEPA - means smt like Single Euro Payments

[20-Nov-18 09:51 AM] Caglio#3337
Well, coinbase states, all deposits in wrong currency, will automaticly be rejected and returned to bank account they were sent to
