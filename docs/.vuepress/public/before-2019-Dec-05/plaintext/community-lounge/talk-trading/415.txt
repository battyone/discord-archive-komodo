@cascrypto shilling KMD is irrelevant with regards to his statement. the UK and Swiss are just more advanced when it comes to crypto regulation (although i'm not too sure about UK though)

[14-Feb-19 04:59 PM] jorian#4555
there is some precedence in dutch law, but it's far from inviting

[14-Feb-19 05:29 PM] tolken#2655
https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-cryptocurrencies-working-products/ nice mention of kmd, but rather poor description of what kmd actually is.

[14-Feb-19 05:38 PM] jorian#4555
the dutch just have a very friendly tax rate

@meatspoon There's a distinct irony in that it's measurably true to state that the majority of your posts are direct ad homs against me or you trolling me about being a troll.
How about being useful for a change?

`I am just committed to treating you as you treat others. `
That would be true if you were functionally useful in the ecosystem and helped them too
Until then, you're just a useless, sad little child trying in vain to be recognized

I only hold 4 long-term coins

I value staking them myself ;)

[14-Feb-19 09:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
all of the coins I hold are coins that I see as potential for currency use-case (granted, none of that counts stuff like MGNX where I hold because there's no market to dump it on)

[14-Feb-19 09:30 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
I'm working on bringing DP to the debit card vendor side of things. That would bring a "currency use-case" to the DigitalPrice coin itself. :troll_compadre:

If I want to KYC, I can get a card from the local coop bank and do some useful good

[14-Feb-19 09:39 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
it seems you already have.

[14-Feb-19 09:39 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
With 7 cards after all?

[14-Feb-19 09:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`it seems you already have.
With 7 cards after all?`
I was using that as an example, there's a card or 2 that have 0 kyc for max limit of like $200

[14-Feb-19 09:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 opay/OUR is working on a store with a massive fulfilment centre at retail price or below. 

Maybe you can’t cash out to fiat with kyc, but you sure as hell can buy Sony tvs, Gucci watches and all the beer you want and sell off some of that loot

[14-Feb-19 09:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then you gotta do that whole laundering thing again though to get it into the bank

[14-Feb-19 09:41 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
My favorite debit card solution, that I've yet seen, is the COLX plaak card. It can even stake COLX for you and it converts them to dollars at the time of transaction.

[14-Feb-19 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Crabby Paddy when 2k OUR spread across all 64 segids can stake more than once a day, I might consider it; until then a working product is all that will get me excited about the project

[14-Feb-19 09:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's no ROI and even less market atm

[14-Feb-19 09:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yeah I get you, too little holders at the moment, but it’s got quite a few things building up in the back. Can’t directly say what they are but keep an eye out for it, I believe it’ll change even your perspective one day 😂

off load some buy back cheaper

[14-Feb-19 10:51 PM] Likewise#6767
nice pump it iwas though but really since 31 dec  up to now we have made zero progress. Need to break those highs which doesnt seem to be in the cards for now. Back to 0.0002 at leaswt.

[14-Feb-19 11:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`4 days of pump yet we couldnt manage to break 31 dec highs?`
yeah, it so sad that it's "only" up 29.62962963% in the last 60 days
I'd demand my investment back if I were you; project out, 283% annual ROI sucks

[14-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Likewise#6767
what was the high 31 dec ? have we broken that? No

[14-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Likewise#6767
so no progress has been made

[14-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Likewise#6767

spike highs are like dumb hookers
they are fun too look at, but in the end totally meaningless and not something you want to revolve your life around
