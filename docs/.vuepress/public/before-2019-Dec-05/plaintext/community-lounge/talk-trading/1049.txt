How people like this end up with 32 btc I don't understand

[08-Aug-19 07:48 AM] coingirl87#6489
I will write of my 32 btc as write-off

[08-Aug-19 07:49 AM] coingirl87#6489

`Was marketing better in your opinion when kmd raised to 12 dollars ????`
nice point though, I'll just keep pasting this whenever anyone complains about poor marketing

I was actually going to post about that, marketing was doing crazy things when it went to $12 üòÑ

[08-Aug-19 08:10 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@coingirl87 there is obviously bots trading all markets. Without buyers, the bot will push the price down to buy more and push price up when it wants to sell.

Marketing has nothing to do with this, unless you think marketing = fomo.

Effective marketing where it leads to user adoption and devs building on KMD is what we need. The marketing team is doing this and the fruits of this will play out over time.

There is no flashy $2m paid partnerships unless the community is willing to fund it. With 32BTC in KMD, it is in your best interest to help KMD get out there. This is where community marketing comes into play https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b7b/3bd9826fa6da81d8a7a3aa3ede3010dc7b45.pdf

Word of mouth gives better results, unless you SPEND LOTS & LOTS of money to EVEN out the effects .

[08-Aug-19 08:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The question everyone should ask themselves, if i believe that the price will keep going down, should i sell? If the answer is you dont want to sell then the next question is, how can i help get user adoption which will result in more people buying/knowing about KMD.

Saying you have no time, is saying that you dont care if your investment goes down, which is fine, it is your money. If you are saying i should get paid to do something, the answer is you dont care if your investment goes down. If you are saying some magical unicorn will appear and they will make the price magically go up, you are saying you dont care if the price goes down.

So at the end of the day if you do want your investment to go up, take some action to make sure that it does. Go out and do dex testing, go on social and let people know about KMD, create a meeting for like minded people to think up of ideas on how we can market better.

the fact is that these are not bots - because red candles with their length indicate panic sales! bots do not so sharply drop the price! it‚Äôs people who are disappointed in the coin they sell to buy a growing bitcoin whose dominance is close to 80% - this will bury the altcoin market for a long time!

[08-Aug-19 08:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not saying 100% is bots as you said, people that dump large amounts at a time are people that want to get into BTC.

[08-Aug-19 08:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But for the most part, bots pushes the market in the direction it wants it to go in, real traders amplify this effect.

[08-Aug-19 09:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Funny thing is that the answer is obvious, it is lack of community willing to help do what they need to, to get KMD out there.

[08-Aug-19 09:09 AM] Oszy#5734
`red candles with their length ` - bots pegged to fiat, those candles always happen when btc increases

[08-Aug-19 09:19 AM] Flint#6435
Most annoying is that komodo drops sharply both with a sharp movement of bitcoin down and with a sharp movement up! and only during lateral movement more or less calmly - but there are no trading volumes either! yes of course - bots also participate as elsewhere!!!

[08-Aug-19 09:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep, so if you dont sell you are not affected üòõ

[08-Aug-19 09:20 AM] Flint#6435
70K satoshi - should be a strong level - but as practice shows, we break ALL levels every day for a month now!

[08-Aug-19 09:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
paper losses is just as useless as paper profits

[08-Aug-19 09:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Everyone wished they had sold at 90k  sats 2 years ago then sold at 20k btc , then bought back in at 3.2k BTC then buy KMD at 5k sats

[08-Aug-19 09:22 AM] klein#5233
Komodo has shown more weakness than normal would be interesting to know if it is the hacked coins being dumped

[08-Aug-19 09:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
:troll_hardcore: we would all be millionaires, if 100x at all the right times, short/long maybe billionaires LOL

We just dont have buyers for the bots that are selling.

[08-Aug-19 09:22 AM] Flint#6435
because there is a certain fireproof price level where REAL holders are located without "weak hands" - only where this level is - maybe $ 0.5 - who knows who knows - we don‚Äôt know until we feel!)

[08-Aug-19 09:23 AM] Flint#6435
@klein  good question!

[08-Aug-19 09:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Acura i wish that was, then i dont need to hear this every day haha

[08-Aug-19 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it does go to the heart of the problem. People want to get paid to do something that any other communities are  doing to make sure their communities are seen, like dash. People invest into projects that they think have a bottomless amount of money to chuck at things. EOS and other projects maybe, but not KMD.

[08-Aug-19 09:25 AM] Acura#2748
I read it every Day, Discord, several Telegram Channels, all crying about the prices - i¬¥m chilled as always - i¬¥m in Crypto since 2013 - i know how the markets are doing

[08-Aug-19 09:26 AM] Flint#6435
one thing I can say with certainty: after such a correction from a maximum of $ 12-13 it will be very difficult to return the price and we can still unsuccessfully try to return at least 50% of the maximum to $ 6 for several more years!

[08-Aug-19 09:26 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I watched the cycles many times since 2013, not worried. Imagine if you were holding a shitcoin but Komodo is solid

[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The next alt season, it wont be all the random coins pumping, it will be solid projects solving real problems with working tech.

[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
crypto market makes you bipolar if you pay too much attention price swings, take the cycles as opportunities to buy when people cry and sell when even your barber is hyping and shilling an Ico

[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] Flint#6435
@KomodoWorld  but when will this season begin? after bitcoin correction from 15,000 or after correction from 20,000? maybe after fixing above 20,000 or after halving? there are so many options and no one will tell the truth even with an accuracy of 50% because then he would be the ruler of the world - and so it remains to defend speculation since there is no hint of an uptrend! this is not a local little correction but a panic!

[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is the time where projects are made. We should rally here as a community to get out there and let devs and project managers know about KMD. Not to shill to hope our bags go up but to get adoption happening.

I've no idea, wait and see

[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So what can we do as a community to make sure it happens for KMD?

[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We build the tech and get people to use it

[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Adoption will equal price rise

[08-Aug-19 09:33 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
take AtomicDEX to Bitcoin/Eth meetups and show it to people

[08-Aug-19 09:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is why i am so angry when people yell marketing this and marketing that. REAL adoption is what we need.

[08-Aug-19 09:34 AM] Flint#6435
it was a rhetorical question!üòã

[08-Aug-19 09:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I know but i respond because there are clearly people that lack critical thinking skills that need to read it.

[08-Aug-19 09:34 AM] klein#5233
atomicdex and hyperdex would get some more real use, can't come soon enough

[08-Aug-19 09:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well atomiclabs (who are making hyperDEX) is helping to fund a dev to assist the team to build the market maker app.

[08-Aug-19 09:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This will allow KMD to be able to generate free money to people that want to do it pretty much risk free

[08-Aug-19 09:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This will bring users that like to make easy money, this will bring liquidity to the DEX, then it will bring traders

So there are plans afoot, but the community NEEDS to get off their ass and do something to help

[08-Aug-19 09:36 AM] klein#5233
Is hyperdex going to be the wallet that effectively replaces agama?

[08-Aug-19 09:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well if you need simple wallet functions it already has that

[08-Aug-19 09:37 AM] klein#5233
no I mean officially

[08-Aug-19 09:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it will be a one stop shop for the DEX and the market making bot

[08-Aug-19 09:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Don't know, we are just 1 of a few apps being made for the community

[08-Aug-19 09:38 AM] Flint#6435
need a working model of adoption in practice!

[08-Aug-19 09:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586

who knows whether it is planned to introduce something like Augur prediction markets - it would help a lot - it is gaining relevance in the field of gambling rates and more!

[08-Aug-19 09:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So there are many things people in the community are doing that will drive adoption and users who will in turn hodl KMD

Six degrees of separation
Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. As a result, a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. It was originally set out by Frigyes Ka...
