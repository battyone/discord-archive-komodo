I know the name Oink is not ideal, but it's the nickname I have for 30 years now... 🤣

Is Chico right.  BTC miners will offer resistance off where their unprofitability point is ?

[01-Oct-19 12:17 AM] JimD#9272
and also, why does the Czech Republic own 10% of BTC mining

[01-Oct-19 05:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Aeetes because he needs money I guess 🙂

I have been stacking these assets since 2014/2015.
I'll be fucking damned if I dump them thoughtlessly any time soon. 🕰

just HODL!

[01-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
not much sellers out there of these anyway, buyers even less just look at DEX is sitting in mm2 for a month now barely anyone bought any of it and it's darn cheap (i picked some up :D)

[01-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
no one even jumped on the cheap Unity

[01-Oct-19 02:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Is the DEX assets allready producing fee for its holders - too lazy to login and check 😛

[01-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Oszy#5734
guess whoever has thousand of these are not going to sell soon at least until first payout 😄

[01-Oct-19 02:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Guess not

[01-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Oszy#5734
first payout will be at $1mil usd dex fee revenue

[01-Oct-19 02:49 PM] CoinKing88#1540
And fee revs are now at? Still 0 because of testing?

[01-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Oszy#5734
no there is a 1/777 fee for takers

[01-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Oszy#5734
no info how much collected so far

[01-Oct-19 02:50 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I almost forgot about DEX to be honest, i dont count them in my PF value b/c its a longterm hodl

[01-Oct-19 02:51 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Is the Verus Agama wallet still a safe place to store them or are there better ways right now?

[01-Oct-19 02:51 PM] Oszy#5734
DEX gets 50% of those revenues so it's almost the best to have

[01-Oct-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
yeah agama is good

[01-Oct-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
or just cli 😄

[01-Oct-19 02:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
CoinExchange is closing is see, that's the only place it was traded as far as i know. So from now on only tradeable on the Atomic App?

[01-Oct-19 03:06 PM] Oszy#5734
yes or OTC

[01-Oct-19 03:34 PM] Acura#2748
Looks like we need the DEX Asset asap on AtmicDex hehe :shexy:

[01-Oct-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CoinKing88 I believe there was a DEX payout end 2017? Not sure... might have been for supernet or some other asset

[01-Oct-19 03:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Acura I think @jorian it was there on Chainswap!

Using Chainswap/atomicdex for trading is actually making your DEX worth more :p

I'm also interested to buy some CRYPTO, DEX and SUPERNET. Do we some some markets for these smartchains/historical assets (CEX or DEX or else) ?

[01-Oct-19 04:41 PM] SHossain#0007
coinexchange.io has market for DEX & SUPERNET. but, not a good idea to use them anymore as they are shutting down soon

@jl777c were all assets distributed already during the Supernet era, those that were created back then?

[01-Oct-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you mean the NXT -> assetchains swap, then yes

sade that he was such a prominent part of our community

[01-Oct-19 07:47 PM] Mische#6695
So 24h vol on cmc is about 56.000.000.000$, lets say this volume will be traded with atomicdex, that would be 56.000.000.000$ / 777 = ~72.000.000$ in fees - there are 1 Mil. DEX which receive 50% of the fee so that would be 36$ / day / DEX right?

[01-Oct-19 07:55 PM] phm87#7395
Does cmc take into account the values of future of BTC and ETH ? I'm not sure

[01-Oct-19 08:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nope

[01-Oct-19 08:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitmex/okex volume is excluded I think?

[01-Oct-19 09:00 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know, I read that recently, Bakkt and CME volume was above the volume of "physical" bitcoins traded meaning that more paper bitcoins were exchanged than normal bitcoins. During 2018, whatever futures (settled by cash) exist, the volume of normal bitcoin exchanged was above. It is another step to crypto to get mainstream. I mean that big players neeeeds futures and other tools to cover, hedge and so on. To compare, about 99% of gold traded is paper gold. Few guys actually own physical gold, buy and sell them

[01-Oct-19 09:01 PM] phm87#7395
When KMDBTC future contracts ? (in a CEX or decentralized with KMD tech: CC and atmicDEX) Settled in KMD, BTC or USDC (nearly fiat) ?

[01-Oct-19 09:03 PM] phm87#7395
I discussed a while ago with @jl777c the possibility to have shorts using a CC module (CC price or CC marketmaker maybe) but I don't remember if we discuss futures nor settlement

[01-Oct-19 09:04 PM] phm87#7395
Whatever KMD trading volume is low to have future, it can be a good tech advantage to have decentralized future contracts with settlement with atomicdex

[01-Oct-19 09:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@phm87  futures are heavily regulated , so would need some party to run it and deal with compliance ,  however similar derivatives and instruments used in derivatives could definitely be created, like forward contracts and chattel paper, which are unregulated or very lightly regulated

[01-Oct-19 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There was a CEX interested in doing KMDBTC futures based out of Malta, I can reach out if this is something people are interested in

[01-Oct-19 09:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
( not Binance )

[01-Oct-19 09:33 PM] phm87#7395
I have no clues about whales desires so I can't help about CEX stuff, I was more thinking about preparing tech for trading of tomorrow. I think that shorts and futures are good for any crypto or asset so yes, I think that it is good for KMD to have the possibility to have futures.

[01-Oct-19 09:38 PM] phm87#7395
I understand clearly your point about regulation and avoid jails for guys who run servers. But if everything is decentralized, each trader should run each asset traded, KMD and maybe a chain for the CC (no centralized servers), maybe it can felt into the DEX stuff that they can't regulate. US changed laws to be able to prosecute devs about opensource contribution so whatever it is decentralized, I understand that we should avoid any (legal) threads on developers

$36 per dex in a day gives with p/e ratio at 16 roughly price of  $300,000 for dex

I'm a little confused as to how to use Chainswap. Is the Swap tab like a market order? Why are none of the existing offers under the Sell tab clickable?

[02-Oct-19 10:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@jorian ☝🏼

[02-Oct-19 10:15 AM] jorian#4555
Sell is setting an order in the orderbook, for other people to buy it. The orders you see there, are just for your information, to see what the current prices are for the thing you want to sell

[02-Oct-19 10:15 AM] jorian#4555
Swap tab is indeed a market order

[02-Oct-19 10:16 AM] jorian#4555
you could say Swap == Market, Sell == Limit
