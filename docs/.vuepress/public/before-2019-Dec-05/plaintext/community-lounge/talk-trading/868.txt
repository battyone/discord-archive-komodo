Not to knock them but how will 78m in VC funding mean anything for the price?

@grewalsatinder whats vc funds?

hehe.... doesn't matter to me.... if a project is good, and I see fair price enough which I can afford and asses it may go up, to my own assessments, I might get it.

[27-Jun-19 12:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

is the Unity and Unreal Komodo RPC/API framework open source?

[27-Jun-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's not yet, I'll wait for that too.

[27-Jun-19 12:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
plz don't take that as I'm bashing anything, I'm just being technically reasonable and just expressing what I like about a project and how I like to see things happen.

Is BITCOIN repeating the Genesis Bull? All eyes on $16000!! for BI...
Bitcoin reached yet another benchmark ($13000) which seemed impossible at the beginning of the year and bullish investors say "we want more"!

At least this is what I said and got greedy (Target 10400 and 12300) when the price was even below 9000, but on a clear accumulation ...

this is interesting actually

[27-Jun-19 01:47 PM] designer#4893
the Internet was created as a distributed system. but 30 years later, it is a monopoly structure that is hard to see in any existing industry. this is because the revenue model of the Internet is based on advertising. Internet content is free. but consumers have to be exposed to numerous ads. 

the reason why this has happened is because the Internet did not support micro-payment technology. true small payments should be made at 10cent to 20cent, free of three things: cumbersome procedures such as membership registration, personal exposure to financial information, and transaction fees. 

no matter how much online shopping grew, payments were forced to go through the financial network because the Internet did not have the technology to support payment services on its own.

bitcoin showed the possibility of micro-payment without going through financial network. the emergence of corporate-guaranteed cryptocurrency such as Libra will also facilitate micro-payments. 

micropayments change the structure of the Internet. If an article, a webcomic and a video can be paid in small amounts, a portal-like hub that can attract advertisers to one place will no longer be needed. 

In other words, the possibility of small payments could bring down global IT dinosaurs such as Facebook, whose advertisements are a major source of income. In other words, Facebook has taken a step closer to self-destructive territory.

Facebook's logic to persuade the government and intellectuals at the hearing is also likely to be related. this means that the situation is so desperate. 

from the moment bitcoin came into the world, the rules of the game began to change. It's just a matter of adjusting to the new rules and surviving.

zuckerberg will persuade the government to allow Libra, saying it cannot stop blockchains like BTC and ETH.

That only means there's more room to grow again!

[27-Jun-19 02:22 PM] yorklab#7270
If BTC can relax for the next three weeks then KMD could do well.

[27-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
will kmd amazon marketplace be up and running 15th july also?

[27-Jun-19 02:29 PM] yorklab#7270
It does appear that AWS is a part of the launch.

[27-Jun-19 02:29 PM] yorklab#7270
But not sure.

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Markus#5464
Sounds good

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Markus#5464
can be huge

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Markus#5464
maybe

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes I was thinking the same. We'll see how well marketing gets the word out.

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Markus#5464
Just one question, ppl are going to pay to make a blockchain on aws right?

[27-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is

[27-Jun-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
last i checked aws wasnt free

[27-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Markus#5464
So kmd will get money from that i assume, how is that money going to be spent?

[27-Jun-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
revenues will support the team

[27-Jun-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and if enough revenues, actual advertising

[27-Jun-19 02:33 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
nice ... exciting times ahead

[27-Jun-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but all that is pretty speculative, just an extrapolation

[27-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Alexfrog#1338
best use of revenues is development, 2nd best use is just buying back KMD i think.   the best "marketing" is a rising price, which is caused by buying

I'm hoping AWS makes a mention of this also.

[27-Jun-19 02:35 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes when price goes up people notice.

[27-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Markus#5464
I would think launching a dev competition with a prize to the person/team who created the best outcome

[27-Jun-19 02:35 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
I still think KMD is a top 10 coin .... can't believe the market doesn't think so

[27-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Alexfrog#1338
agreed

[27-Jun-19 02:35 PM] PTYX#6840
@Alexfrog what happens when you run out of money to buy back?

[27-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Alexfrog#1338
you only buy back when price is cheap and you have plenty of funds

[27-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Alexfrog#1338
to cover dev + extra

[27-Jun-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
correct. it is best to let the market do what the market does

[27-Jun-19 02:36 PM] PTYX#6840
@Alexfrog sounds very simple written down, not so in real life

[27-Jun-19 02:37 PM] PTYX#6840
and that's not a sustainable model. basically it's just price manipulation to an extent.

[27-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Alexfrog#1338
well thats why they pay the team the big bucks üòõ

[27-Jun-19 02:37 PM] PTYX#6840
a team of developers, not traders

[27-Jun-19 02:39 PM] Alexfrog#1338
i just meant buying with funds at time when alts are severely undervalued like now

[27-Jun-19 02:39 PM] p.#1126
Maybe this maybe that , give us money

[27-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Markus#5464
would a blockchain be able to handle a mmorpg to be run on a single chain or would it overextend it too much? thats quite alot of data if u want to collect all player data

[27-Jun-19 02:41 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
atomic swaps will be huge in due time ... price now does not refelect  anywhere close .... bargain prices imo

[27-Jun-19 02:41 PM] yorklab#7270
Actually, buying KMD when it's really super cheap would be a great idea if the project could afford it. When the price goes up later it can be used for more development.

[27-Jun-19 02:44 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
if I had more spare funds I would be buying more KMD

Many altcoins benefited from the last bull run in $BTC

Cryptomaniancs expect alts to do so again - they may be very disappointed

2000 .com bubble is analog

Following 2001-02 tech collapse, dotcoms with real value exploded

The "alt" .coms went bankrupt

[27-Jun-19 03:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
Do big tx fees really matter?  I think about the tx fees i pay on gasoline... they are large.  In part probably because the first oil companies became the biggest and it suited them to have large tx fees

[27-Jun-19 03:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
i think about all the tx fees behind a cob of corn from the supermarket (corn subsidies, bureaucratic bullshit, multiple levels of taxes) and they are high

[27-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
For pop miners they matter

[27-Jun-19 03:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
i think there is an argument to be made that if you are first to market, command a lions share of it and have vendors already sinking costs into integrating your service...  high tx fees dont seem to be a killer

[27-Jun-19 03:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am not very familiar with ETH tx fees, so i am kinda talking out of my ass here, but I would imagine they pale in comparison (percentage wise) to almost any other significant transactions we make in our lives using fiat
