I like this though ;p

[03-Aug-18 05:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
might be interesting for kmd to reach out

[03-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dontrustverify#1166
Just bought another few thou Kmd :)

[03-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dontrustverify#1166
Bad timing ?

[03-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dontrustverify#1166
I got a few yesterday at 16k Sat

[03-Aug-18 06:25 PM] BlockTech#6895
I think it's a good choice.

[03-Aug-18 06:26 PM] BlockTech#6895
i bought at 70k Sat ...

[03-Aug-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
16k was the lowest price in over a year, very good timing. 25% gains from the low on very high volume, seems to indicate that 16k was the capitulation low and unlikely we get back to that level

[03-Aug-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> Anyone remember the kmd ico price?

[03-Aug-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
many of the alts today reversed direction, so it looks like BTC dominance might reverse directions. The first time I can remember when KMD was one of the first alts to change directions, usually it was the second or even third wave of alts. If it really is leading the altcoin rally, that is a strong testament to the progress that has been made

[03-Aug-18 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ICO price was about 10 cents and 10k sats

[03-Aug-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <mamatrader> when 100k sats?

[03-Aug-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> Komodo team rocks. It feels like you guys are setting up the chess pieces and one day the dragon will awaken

[03-Aug-18 07:13 PM] dontrustverify#1166
Thanks , im going to liquidate 50% of my Veritaseum token's for more Kmd

[03-Aug-18 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
market price will eventually reflect value, but if you are concentrating your KMD holdings, it is best to not really look at price as the market is still in its irrational phase. just look at the usage based rankings: http://blocktivity.info/ and https://www.coinfairvalue.com/
blocktivity counts things at the payments level while coinfairfalue does at the tx level, so it is underrating KMD which has optimized blockchain usage with a large scale usage of multiple payments per tx
