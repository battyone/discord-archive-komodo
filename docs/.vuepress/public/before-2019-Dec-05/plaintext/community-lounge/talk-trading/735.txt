[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Ye

[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] richardt#2807
That was one of the best time to sell!

[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] actionslacks#4072
I traded some for Pirate

[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I bought when supernet got delisted off polo

[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] richardt#2807
I sold a good amount around that time as well

[05-Jun-19 12:14 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
And people panick sell

[05-Jun-19 12:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
that was a good time to buy

[05-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Tek#5253
BCH back at 0.05

[05-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Tek#5253
the past month its been going in the range 0.047 to 0.053

[05-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Supernet is like this rare asset that if it works out

[05-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
The payout is immense

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
But the catch is it is still not trustless

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Everyone always forgot about Supernet x2. Was buying that up when it was the same price as the standard supernet.

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Upon the faith and trust of james

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I have x2

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Tek#5253
I really dont care about trustlessness and all that, since I don't have big capital yet anyway

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Tek#5253
i just need gains

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Like 200 or something

[05-Jun-19 12:16 AM] Alright#0419
x2 doesn't exist anymore

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Oh yeah it got switched?

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
it got swapped

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
From nxt?

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Yeah

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
revs?

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
During the swap you receive supernet and revs.

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] freakbros#9074
Where is pondseed

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Tek#5253
pepe wants some pondseed

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] Alright#0419
@freakbros hyperDEX#6586

[05-Jun-19 12:17 AM] freakbros#9074
O

[05-Jun-19 12:18 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Not sure if Revs will ever be anything but I'm sitting on 20k of them after all the swaps.

[05-Jun-19 12:18 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I think revs will be better off than shitcoins

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
At least you have an intrinsic value behind iy

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] richardt#2807
If SuperNET works out, it could be like buying Berkshire Hathaway stocks during the 60s-70s

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Rather than hopes and dreams

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It is

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Something that pays you crypto as an asset is immense

[05-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I have more trust in Revs than Verge.

[05-Jun-19 12:20 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Makes sense James buys supernet cuz he's the one running it

[05-Jun-19 12:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
I haven't stumbled across anything else with the technical layout and premise in crypto yet

[05-Jun-19 12:20 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
But for me I dunno what is gonna shit the fense

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Tek#5253
> Verge

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Tek#5253
You mean XVG?

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Tek#5253
cause thats one of the shittiest chains ever

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Tek#5253
the dev is complteely incompetent

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Tek#5253
its been 51% attacked, time warped, multiple hacks

[05-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Crypto assets are always a big thing

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Especially at a QE time like this

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
non inflationary

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Dividend crypto investing y'all no what I'm sayinh

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] actionslacks#4072
like a boss homey

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Verge is the type of coin you try to make a quick buck on and forget about it.

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Ye

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Tek#5253
I've followed verge very closely

[05-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Tek#5253
its really one of the shittiest

[05-Jun-19 12:23 AM] Tek#5253
especially when they released the so much anticipated "wraith protocol"

[05-Jun-19 12:23 AM] Tek#5253
which was gonna blow xmr out of the water , and zcash

[05-Jun-19 12:23 AM] Tek#5253
2 years later they release it. its just a tor routing added to the wallet

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Can't expect much from a coin that used to be name Dogecoindark

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Tek#5253
yeah

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Tek#5253
Doge isn't maintained code

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] actionslacks#4072
or darkcoin for that matter

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Tek#5253
why work with a fork of it

[05-Jun-19 12:24 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
The devs were just trying to cash in on the dark name that Bitcoindark started.

[05-Jun-19 12:25 AM] Tek#5253
I don't even understand why DOGE is still being used

[05-Jun-19 12:25 AM] Tek#5253
code hasn't been maintained for over 2 years now

[05-Jun-19 12:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
I dont think anyone does

[05-Jun-19 12:25 AM] Tek#5253
yeah well then Elon Tusk tweets "DOGE" and everyone rushes to buy

[05-Jun-19 12:26 AM] Tek#5253
> rushing to buy a dead joke project

[05-Jun-19 12:26 AM] Tek#5253
the absolute state

[05-Jun-19 12:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
this space is not based in reality

[05-Jun-19 12:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's an alternate universe

[05-Jun-19 12:27 AM] Tek#5253
truly. and thats why I believe we don't dump any further than 7200 or even we don't dump any further than right NOW and we continue moonto 10k

[05-Jun-19 12:27 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I mean dogs are always worth something

[05-Jun-19 12:27 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It's like those Pokemon cards

[05-Jun-19 12:27 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
You cannot issue more doge

[05-Jun-19 12:29 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
A very liquid Pokemon cards

Let's assume an asset yields 1BTC every year

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
What is that asset worth?

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] Tek#5253
100 MILLION SATOSHERS?

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] Tek#5253
OH MY GOD

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] meatspoon#7860
Does one just hold SuperNET in the Agama wallet to receive rev share?

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] richardt#2807
Yes

[05-Jun-19 12:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
I was in a facebook crypto group for awhile. If you ever wanna get an idea of how many people are going to get completely destroyed soon check out some of those. the delusional behaviour is rampant

Is supernet traded anywhere other than otc swaps?

[05-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Probably just OTC

[05-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
People don't sell a lot or buy a lot

Unless the price is really good

[05-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Oh nice

[05-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
When Supernet paid out the revenue share in december 2017 the KMD showed up in Agama just like any other transaction.

[05-Jun-19 12:31 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is that assetchain supernet or Nxt supernet?
