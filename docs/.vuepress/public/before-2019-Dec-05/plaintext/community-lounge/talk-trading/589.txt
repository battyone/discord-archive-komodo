I had a bunch of old wallets that I finally moved, so I went diggin for clams.

[30-Apr-19 02:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
clams are $9 each? Sounds like I need to find some old wallets...

@NNoperator may I ask where you are selling clams?

[30-Apr-19 02:19 AM] NNoperator#3835
https://freebitcoins.com/swap/        Polo also works if you  are OK with them being in your business.

also  I suggest using justdice to dig the clams.  Easy as pie.

[30-Apr-19 02:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
seems shady üòÉ

[30-Apr-19 02:27 AM] NNoperator#3835
Yup be sure that's the last thing you have in that old wallet.

[30-Apr-19 02:28 AM] NNoperator#3835
But I have used justdice many times to dig clams and no problems.

Buy and sell ClamCoin (CLAM) on YoBit Exchange!

i've never used yobit

[30-Apr-19 02:32 AM] NNoperator#3835
I haven't any experience there either.

[30-Apr-19 02:37 AM] NNoperator#3835
.00037 per Clam is not close to 9 USD  More like 1.94   something isn't right there.

[30-Apr-19 02:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably some knock-off

[30-Apr-19 02:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[30-Apr-19 02:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I have many friends there

[30-Apr-19 02:50 AM] NNoperator#3835
@dukeleto  Sorry I took out most freebitcoins.com swapping supply.  They will probably recharge some by tomorrow.    It paid pretty well: for 52 clams I was able to end up with 487 KMD after exchanging the BTC.

was VBK 51% attacked reorg recently?

[30-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
a 3 block reorg stalled nodes

[30-Apr-19 03:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Wait what

[30-Apr-19 03:56 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
That a pretty normal event

[30-Apr-19 03:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Weird that it would stall nodes.  Gonna pop over and learn about what happened

[30-Apr-19 04:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Vbk didn‚Äôt see it coming

[30-Apr-19 04:13 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I thought that was their main selling point

[30-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
I called out that shiggidy guy in their discord for calling a reorg that happened on BSV a "51% attack". They blew it off as "BSV sucks anyway" kind of thing. Wonder how upset he'd get now if we started calling this a "51% attack".

[30-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
to be clear, I couldn't give two shits about BSV, was just pointing out that he was spreading misinformation like he always does

Zcash has ~450 million USD marketcap, but it would only cost ~1/20th $ZEC ($4/day) to fill all blocks and stop all real transactions on it. No bug bounty program, because devs already found most of the bugs: üßê

[30-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253

[30-Apr-19 11:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
since ZEC found new ATL's since that tweet, it's even cheaper now

[30-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Tek#5253
does it affect KMD? should I sell my zec bags?

[30-Apr-19 11:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't give financial advice, only technical

[30-Apr-19 11:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
All Sapling-enabled coins have this issue, but because of the way ZEC decided to choose their parameters, they have the largest marketcap and also are the easiest to attack

[30-Apr-19 11:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC painted a target on their backs

[30-Apr-19 11:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
Bugs happen, but their response to me was "There is no bug, there are no bounties, your security research has no value"

[30-Apr-19 11:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
hence the memes and Sapling Woodchippers being rev'ed up

[30-Apr-19 11:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has various mitigations implemented that ZEC does not, and ZEC having the much larger marketcap makes it the much larger target

Asics don't care about hodl'ing

[30-Apr-19 12:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC is extremely profitable to mine, extremely unprofitable to HODL

Some traders find similarities between ZEC price chart after launch and Grin's one.
Grin is making some ATL these days btw

[30-Apr-19 12:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
Also, think of the implications on KMD re: 75% of block reward goes to notaries

[30-Apr-19 12:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
Notaries are mostly long-term KMD hodlers, who sell bits for expenses. 75% of mined KMD is mostly HODLed. My guess is 95% of mined ZEC is instantly sold to pay for new ASICs. The dynamics of KMD and ZEC are completely different, in terms of supply+demand, which is why the KMD chart looks way prettier

[30-Apr-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the 5% rewards are a lot more than all mining, but once you start collecting 5%, the urge is to compound it

[30-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

That's a tendency that extends beyond Australia, unfortunately.

[30-Apr-19 03:30 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Alts regaining some ground, KMD seems to be set in stone around 18K sats. The differance between USDT and PAX/TUSD etc. is almost gone again. People seems to have forgotten allready about the 850 million missing if they all try to liquidate USDT?

[30-Apr-19 04:05 PM] Markus#5464
the 850m was not missing just not available atm cause of being locked down

At current rates, the average price of one VBK is therefore around 4000 satoshi for these miners to break even. Based on individual users‚Äô efficiency, this can be higher or lower. The above calculation forgoes failed PoP transactions, which do not net any reward. Based on discussions with PoP miners, these costs are around 20% on top of the regular PoP costs.
