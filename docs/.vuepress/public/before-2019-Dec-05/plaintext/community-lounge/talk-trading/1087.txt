I think there's a few other ones that are in beta like Zaddex but i don't know much about them.

well blockchain consulting will probably always be profitable

We don't just have money invested. We have years of our lives invested as well. Not just going to jump ship

So how do u turn a sinking ship if it manages to dump to 1 cent, this is a worst case scenario i doubt it will happen

[22-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
Development would likely scale back, but it would not stop.

[22-Aug-19 05:36 PM] PTYX#6840
once the KMD price breaks below the break-even for most notary nodes then it becomes an issue.

[22-Aug-19 05:36 PM] PTYX#6840
development won't stop

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
shitty what if, mate ü§£

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
when the price was good., I sold a lot so that i dont need to worry about what the price is

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] PTYX#6840
but the price affects other things

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
looks at price *maybe* once a week

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
really hardly matters

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
from my perspective at least

[22-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Markus#5464
I mean everyone worrying about alts getting ultimate rekt atm so i think its good to know how coins u invested into would manage worst case scenarios

[22-Aug-19 05:38 PM] phm87#7395
I continued to pay servers of my pools (400‚Ç¨ monthly) despite low earnings (5 to 20‚Ç¨ monthly)

[22-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
You can lead up development when it happens @Markus

[22-Aug-19 05:38 PM] PTYX#6840
that's admirable, but not everyone has 400 Euros to throw at a node every month.

[22-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
There are a million and one possible side gigs in crypto

[22-Aug-19 05:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is why my notary node is ridiculusly cheap.... Even if KMD 20c it still pay for iteslf easily

[22-Aug-19 05:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its dead last but :troll:

[22-Aug-19 05:40 PM] Markus#5464
I have a real job so im more then fine outside of crypto, i invested in kmd for a reason thats why i just wanted to know how kmd would approach such situation. I have no doubt things would become much different and probably some things would possible even change for the better who knows rly

[22-Aug-19 05:41 PM] PTYX#6840
@Markus it's hard to tell how the KMD project itself would handle it. We aren't in the core team. At least i'm not so i have no idea how it would be approached.

[22-Aug-19 05:41 PM] PTYX#6840
The above is mostly opinions by individuals, some of us notary nodes.

[22-Aug-19 05:42 PM] PTYX#6840
i doubt the project would die, it could just scale back to the bare bones

[22-Aug-19 05:42 PM] Markus#5464
Yea sure its nice to see other ppls view aswell

[22-Aug-19 05:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Price of kmd has little to do with continuing development.

[22-Aug-19 05:46 PM] cascrypto#8206
Finding market is key imho

[22-Aug-19 05:47 PM] cascrypto#8206
And the hardest to achieve

[22-Aug-19 05:51 PM] richardt#2807
Getting adoption and real utility is key.  Not a problem unique to KMD and something every crypto project has aimed for but still not yet able to achieve

[22-Aug-19 05:57 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@PTYX KDM needs fresh investors since internal projects eat KMD finance it can either grow or eat each other internal project or overal ecosystem funds

[22-Aug-19 05:57 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also with time some peopel cashing out so to support that fresh investors are needed

[22-Aug-19 05:59 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
might be time to make more aggresive marketing for example targeting scammy projects and redirecting finance from those to KMD

[22-Aug-19 05:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No

[22-Aug-19 06:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not doing a Zcash /Ycash

[22-Aug-19 06:03 PM] PTYX#6840
from my perspective KMD needs to focus on tangible revenue streams. the atomicdex is one example of something that could generate a steady stream of income of the project.

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[22-Aug-19 06:03 PM] richardt#2807
KMD has proven many times that marketing is not their strong suit.  IMO KMD should focus most of the time and resources into getting atomicDEX solid and out of beta.  It has the potential to be the killer app to raise adoption/utility and bring in more people to learn about KMD

[22-Aug-19 06:04 PM] PTYX#6840
Antara I don't think will create much revenue because high profile companies that are looking to build on blockchain don't need to launch a chain in 5 minutes. The often need customized solutions with their own apps.

[22-Aug-19 06:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tangible revenue streams and feedback loops

[22-Aug-19 06:04 PM] PTYX#6840
If KMD gave us a license to sell the atomicdex as whitelabel, we'd sell the heck out of it.

[22-Aug-19 06:05 PM] richardt#2807
what's stopping them?

[22-Aug-19 06:05 PM] PTYX#6840
however, with the sale there needs to be a robust and very easy flowing integration and development process. We can't depend on the KMD team doing everything for us. So we would need to be able to do everything ourselves in order for it to work.

[22-Aug-19 06:05 PM] PTYX#6840
@richardt still in beta at the moment

[22-Aug-19 06:06 PM] PTYX#6840
we already have people interested. We're also working on the Chameleon DEX based on the atomicdex api. whichever gets done first, is what we will go with.

[22-Aug-19 06:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Antara will be like WordPress

[22-Aug-19 06:06 PM] PTYX#6840
wordpress for?

[22-Aug-19 06:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Blockchains duh :troll:

[22-Aug-19 06:07 PM] PTYX#6840
right but again, not many companies are looking to just press a button and launch a generic chain

[22-Aug-19 06:07 PM] PTYX#6840
sure some do, but not many. and most likley if they want a 5 minute blockchain it's to ICO or something like that

[22-Aug-19 06:08 PM] PTYX#6840
it's not a clear revenue stream from my perspective

[22-Aug-19 06:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
WordPress itself generates revs through wordpress.com ,  much like Antara it‚Äôs. A creation and hosting service. but majority of rev streams are from the economy of themes and plugins that spring up around.

[22-Aug-19 06:08 PM] PTYX#6840
selling software, consulting, and creating passive revenue streams within those apps may be a better approach

[22-Aug-19 06:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Similar situation will be for Komodo and modules

[22-Aug-19 06:10 PM] Markus#5464
companies will probably want multiple blockchains

[22-Aug-19 06:10 PM] Markus#5464
so u will have to build a custom multi chain structure

[22-Aug-19 06:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PTYX  those are being worked on as well

[22-Aug-19 06:11 PM] PTYX#6840
not in my experience. companies are looking to improve their business processes with blockchain. launching a generic chain doesn't help many companies.

[22-Aug-19 06:12 PM] PTYX#6840
those types of integrations not only require blockchain but different layers of technology that most enterprise already use. So launching a 5 minute blockchain doesn't really solve that.

[22-Aug-19 06:12 PM] richardt#2807
IMO KMD focuses too much on something that could be rather than something that is more practical.  Right now the crypto industry has a huge need for a solid DEX.  AtomicDEX is a good solution - need to focus more on it

[22-Aug-19 06:14 PM] Markus#5464
Eth Classic mooning quite well

[22-Aug-19 06:14 PM] Markus#5464

against btc

[22-Aug-19 06:14 PM] PTYX#6840
if i was KMD i'd focus on tailored blockchain consulting for larger firms, whitelabeling all the software, and making passive revenue streams through exchange, ads, and other fees that can be passed down to the users.

[22-Aug-19 06:15 PM] Alright#0419
"KMD isn't a business"

[22-Aug-19 06:15 PM] PTYX#6840
at least that's what my business department would be doing. development is differnt

[22-Aug-19 06:15 PM] PTYX#6840
@Alright sure it isn't, but it's trying to make revenue is it not?

[22-Aug-19 06:15 PM] PTYX#6840
so it is a business. no matter how we paint it. it's not an NGO

[22-Aug-19 06:23 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe KMD is not a business but it needs money for ecosystem growth and for development ...

[22-Aug-19 06:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Literally all of that is being worked on now.   Rev sharing deals,  consulting,  planning to monetize the newsfeed ,  selling whitelabels ( when the software is eventually ready ).  Komodo itself isn‚Äôt a business,  businesses around it seek to generate revenues.   You are not the only one,   A simple example:  you want to whitelabel/ license Atomicdex , well it‚Äôs not komodo that you will be making an agreement with ( as Komodo has no entity ) but another persons business.

[22-Aug-19 06:23 PM] jorian#4555
KMD open source vs KMD platform. i see them as 2 separate things

[22-Aug-19 06:23 PM] jorian#4555
if KMD were a business, james wouldn't be releasing nspv fo free

[22-Aug-19 06:24 PM] PTYX#6840
atomicdex is closed source

{Reactions}
üôä 

[22-Aug-19 06:24 PM] PTYX#6840
so we really can't say it's all open source

[22-Aug-19 06:24 PM] jorian#4555
the gui, yes

[22-Aug-19 06:24 PM] jorian#4555
the protocol not so much

[22-Aug-19 06:24 PM] PTYX#6840
@polycryptoblog so if we make a contract with kmd to sell the AtomicDEX softwarwe or integrations, who would we be signing a contract with?

[22-Aug-19 06:25 PM] PTYX#6840
hopefull not redfox üòÑ

[22-Aug-19 06:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No,  there is another

[22-Aug-19 06:25 PM] PTYX#6840
looking forward to learn more

[22-Aug-19 06:25 PM] PTYX#6840
we're down to sell it.

[22-Aug-19 06:26 PM] PTYX#6840
i heard the dex was coming out of beta soon.

[22-Aug-19 06:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôve been saying the target is the end of the year ,   Never know when something gets hung up.  But I know that the stress test is supposed to be happening soon, like in a week or so.  So definitely it‚Äôs moving forward on schedule.

[22-Aug-19 06:29 PM] PTYX#6840
end of the year is a good target.

[22-Aug-19 06:30 PM] PTYX#6840
we're in the process of launching the point of sale devices along with our OTC desk in Panama around October/November so after that I'd be happy to focus on the AtomicDEX marketing/sales.

[22-Aug-19 06:31 PM] PTYX#6840
we're also a bit busy building a whitelabel wallet for another project but once that's done we will start implementing the atomicdex api in Chameleon. probably not in full release but at least to start working on the UX/UI.

[22-Aug-19 06:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Definitely need it,  I want to start moving with the atm thing I talked to you about,  whether it‚Äôs Atomicdex or chainzilla with Dex integration ,  first come first serve,  but as you know will need some custom work.  Get me that FFBD brochure! Lol
