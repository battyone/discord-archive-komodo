Educate me

[14-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
I've only skimmed the Komodo whitepaper

[14-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Geocold51#6462
so I am sure there is a lot I do not know

[14-Oct-18 05:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
64 nodes are elected, yes.

[14-Oct-18 05:24 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
13 at least need to be matched to get a notarization

[14-Oct-18 05:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What aspect is the one you think is centralized?

[14-Oct-18 05:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And at what concept of "centralized" you are refering to?

[14-Oct-18 05:25 AM] Geocold51#6462
That 13 people have a significant impact on the network

[14-Oct-18 05:25 AM] Geocold51#6462
can have*

[14-Oct-18 05:25 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Since notary nodes only do a service. So there is no underlying power over the chains

[14-Oct-18 05:26 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
What kind of significant "impact"?

[14-Oct-18 05:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I cant do much over the chains i notarize.

[14-Oct-18 05:27 AM] PTYX#6840
A notary either notarized or doesn't. If they don't fulfil their duties they can be replaced

[14-Oct-18 05:28 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I just run a node of the chain in my server like any other user

[14-Oct-18 05:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I just plug a system on top that automates the snapshotting, messaging and synchronization between the notary peers

[14-Oct-18 05:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I cant manipulate blocks at all

[14-Oct-18 05:30 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I cant seed up or delay transactions either

[14-Oct-18 05:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Geocold51 do u understand that every next notarisation happens it randomly selects those 13 notaries? And they are not the same?

[14-Oct-18 05:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
How far a collusion can go of NOT notarisation with this 13 random selection of notary node?

[14-Oct-18 05:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
My maths is week, plz help me your calculations

[14-Oct-18 05:45 AM] Geocold51#6462
Sure.

[14-Oct-18 05:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I think that its just a new concept for him and he will have questions.

[14-Oct-18 05:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its something that happens to everyone.

[14-Oct-18 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep 
I want to see a valid criticism of dPoW too

[14-Oct-18 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To my understanding it‚Äôs not centralised

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
The only thing I can think of is that checkpoints are based off the bitcoin block time not the coins blocktime so you could do a 1-2 conf double spend maybe. However I only know the broad strokes

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
For say a coin like EMC2

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
Because it has a 2.5 min block time

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
so you have a fair bit of time between checkpoints

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
idk much about dPoW tho

[14-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Geocold51#6462
lemme know what you all think

[14-Oct-18 05:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Ok, EMC2 will notarize to KMD each 2.5min

[14-Oct-18 05:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
EMC2 is 2.5mi. Blocks but kmd is 1min blocks

[14-Oct-18 05:48 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So it will have a kmd notarization on every block

[14-Oct-18 05:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes, a non notarised block and notarised block height is important. Reorg chain till yhe pint it‚Äôs not notarised

[14-Oct-18 05:49 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
KMD on the other side, notarizes to btc every 10min.

[14-Oct-18 05:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can not reorg chain past notarised block

[14-Oct-18 05:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So there is this space of time (10min.) That the attacker could try ans hack kmd

[14-Oct-18 05:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I already understand that. Plz clear centralised point if u can

[14-Oct-18 05:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But 10min is quite small window to do double spends in 2 chains at the same time

[14-Oct-18 05:51 AM] Geocold51#6462
yes

Makes u an Assetchain 
A runtime fork of Komodo

[14-Oct-18 05:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Attack it all u can. Sill keep re-orging 
Let @blackjok3r notarise it on his alt notary network

[14-Oct-18 05:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
U cant re-org it past notarised block height

[14-Oct-18 05:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Yeah, exactly, that too

[14-Oct-18 05:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Alright can help u with re-oeging if any trouble there

[14-Oct-18 05:54 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once chain is notarized it will look for the longest chain that has the same notarized block

[14-Oct-18 05:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So its virtually impossible to trick clients into pointing to your chain if you dont have the same notarytxid

[14-Oct-18 05:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
To clear on 
@Alright 
He‚Äôs kinda 51% attack guy here. He regularly test such possibilities of attack by testing and attacking chains

[14-Oct-18 05:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
More on that, we have many ppl here who built tools to break chains!

[14-Oct-18 05:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ask in #dev-scalability channel how

[14-Oct-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Judging KMD as a centralised notarised system, I would expect much detail from u to back in that judgment. Give me details NOT an opinion. M interested to know how it‚Äôs centralised.

[14-Oct-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hang around here and learn from others

[14-Oct-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
We learned so much just hanging around here and talking to each other

Are you alright bro?

Havent seen you in a couple of days

[14-Oct-18 07:49 AM] snowdamn#2414
@Geocold51 here's the response i got by lead dev (jl777) why can't do much in the window between notarizations, was afk or i would have posted earlier:
"if the exchange requires more than 3 EMC2 confirms then his deposit wont be accepted
if it is double spent
if it is notarized, then he cant do the deposit
so either way the key is that the exchange requires more deposits than the notarization lag
or best case to use the notarization lag as the required confirmations"

[14-Oct-18 07:52 AM] snowdamn#2414
now i'm wondering what's the case with DEX? ü§î

[14-Oct-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX is in test mode a lot of times during tests

[14-Oct-18 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you want to spend the resources to 51% a chain for a specific swap, you could if the other side isnt waiting for notarization

treasure 

[14-Oct-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the way you make economic gain via 51% attack is to spend the funds, convert it to something else, then erase that (the spend the funds part) but the convert it to something else already happened and presumably you are off to the races to cash that out

[14-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
since DEX trades are now for relatively small amounts, it is less than the cost of a 51% attack for the most part

[14-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
for production the confirmations logic for barterDEX needs to use the notarization

[14-Oct-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the initial notarization to KMD provides a lot of the protection against the reorgs, so no need to wait for the BTC side to complete, still it will prevent attempts to reorg past the notarization

[14-Oct-18 07:57 AM] snowdamn#2414
thanks again, James! üëç 
not much to gain for all the effort and too many easier targets out there to bother
but comforting to know confirmations logic can be added to DEX! üçæ 
i'm sure geocold will get it...

[14-Oct-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, one step at a time. being the most complex target to attack provides good practical protection, even if it isnt 100% perfect

[14-Oct-18 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the variance in lag does provide some times of higher chance for attack to work, but the attacker wont know ahead of time if it is getting into such a high lag period

[14-Oct-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so the risk of the entire attack just not working with a notarization coming in soon after the private chain is being built... and all that hash down the drain

to me the most important seems - if you wait for notarization then you can be sure transaction is good.  That solutions seems  totally reasonable, optimal. Questions is - how can I easy check if my transaction is notarized ? I 've seen somewhere there is kind of function call, but as a user I would prefer to see it on some kind of explorer?
