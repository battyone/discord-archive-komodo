@Alexfrog even better, happy ending is from VRSC with a sloppy smile from Mike

Will we see 80% BTC dominance?

[05-Sep-19 01:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's happened before.

[05-Sep-19 01:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
A lot of this KMD sell pressure is ASIC miners getting their brand new miners, very late, and trying to break even. All equihash (200,9) coins have similar charts

[05-Sep-19 01:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
Those damn miners are selling things to oblivion

[05-Sep-19 01:22 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i dont think kmd mining is much sell pressure

[05-Sep-19 01:23 AM] Alexfrog#1338
sell pressure is mainly altcoin bear, and secondarily the insider drama i bet

[05-Sep-19 01:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alexfrog i guess it's true for other coins with their emission curves, but KMD mines 4320 new KMD per day, and you are correct, that is less sell pressure than the whales hurting the orderbook, I guess

[05-Sep-19 01:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
1440 blocks per day x 3 KMD = 4320 KMD

[05-Sep-19 01:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
decent assumption is that 50% of that is sold daily/weekly by miners paying electricity, so without more buy pressure,that will depress price. Lack of whales buying makes normal miner selling depress the price. It's hard to say exactly, I guess

[05-Sep-19 01:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
most coins have miner sell pressure.  thats not what made KMD fall from rank 50 to 70

[05-Sep-19 01:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, 20 new stablecoins üòâ

[05-Sep-19 01:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
Rankings are pretty useless these days, but it is a metric

[05-Sep-19 01:37 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no thats not it, KMD fell 20 ranks with only a couple new coins being above it

[05-Sep-19 02:12 AM] Mark81#4505
How much has kmd hashrate risen from those asic miners?

[05-Sep-19 02:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is difficulty, but is roughly the same-looking graph as hashrate, just different units

[05-Sep-19 03:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
cashing in rewards could be constant sell pressure as well

@Alexfrog oh yeah? I would have sworn it said ‚Äúbefore the 5th‚Äù

[05-Sep-19 06:39 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Small volume plus rewards dump. 4k sats soon? üò¶ Can't believe this madness anymore. Atomicdex gets regocnition from Forbes and here we are. Price is still going only down. Komodo should be very aggressive with Atomicdex promotion and use it's first mover advantage or some 1st gen solution like decred takes over before anyone notice it.

[05-Sep-19 06:40 AM] Oszy#5734
nah, the last 700k dump dropped only 300 sats, 250k is "nothing"

[05-Sep-19 06:42 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I hope you are right. üòÖ

[05-Sep-19 06:42 AM] tolken#2655
Agreed, i really doubt we see much of a dump at these prices. Last btc spike from 9k to 10k, Kmd barely budged from current levels.

[05-Sep-19 06:43 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve been wrong before. What‚Äôs one more time?

[05-Sep-19 06:44 AM] tolken#2655
@Alexfrog from their initial release ‚Äúrewards will be calculated up until September 1, 2019, with the total amount distributed equal to the staking rewards accrued on holdings during the period.
KMD rewards are calculated daily and distributed monthly. Distributions will be completed before the 5th of each month.‚Äù

[05-Sep-19 06:45 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, impatient we are, but yeah - they flaked.

[05-Sep-19 06:46 AM] tolken#2655

most reward/stake/airdrop coins binance supports only dumps. Just one example: My fave erc20 shit PundiX drowned underwater when binance started to support Pundi airdrops. It was about 30 sats before and now it's 3-4 sats.

[05-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
that's of course because most people don't value anything they get for free.

is it any wonder nobody except hardcore kmd geeks know about it yet?

[05-Sep-19 07:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
Open beta is coming. Closed beta is in progress and has enough testers. Perhaps there are waiting in order to prevent getting mobbed for testing invites.

[05-Sep-19 07:59 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
that's bad excuse

[05-Sep-19 08:01 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
please don't make excuses for lame or non existent kmd will to promote it's work. This has been kmd's problem since the beginning.

[05-Sep-19 08:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is a lot of things that need tested and built ,  there is more to the Dex than just the Atomicdex client

Open beta is coming. That why it should be promoted. Look at shit like Digitex futures. They got over million subscribers for the opening of the beta when platform open for testing. One million subs.

[05-Sep-19 08:07 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
and it's complete shit and scam.

[05-Sep-19 08:08 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So is the claim of a million subscribers

[05-Sep-19 08:08 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
it's over 1.5 million now. https://digitexfutures.com/

It's not hard to give email. I'm on that waitlist too. I'm pretty sure those numbers are valid. Typical scammers are masters at promotion. Then you see one youtube video with digitex ceo and you'll see what kind of fucking amateur he is. Then you regret you you subcribed to it in the first place.

@Oszy same, got about a 5th of what I was expecting.

[05-Sep-19 08:32 AM] tolken#2655
Seems like Binance did some very fuzzy math.

[05-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
no i think there is just a lot more KMD on binance than you thought

[05-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i estimate its around 10-15M KMD on binance

[05-Sep-19 08:33 AM] tolken#2655
How are you estimating?

[05-Sep-19 08:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so if you had 1k KMD there, you got 1/10000th of the 250k reward, or like 25 KMD or so, plus a monthly claim of a few more

[05-Sep-19 08:34 AM] tolken#2655
Right, I got that math, but how are you estimating 10,000,000?

[05-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
based on how much i got

[05-Sep-19 08:36 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i think its closer to 15M

[05-Sep-19 08:37 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
My point is that If you have any other social media accounts than discord, please promote atomicdex there as much as you can. üòÉ

[05-Sep-19 08:37 AM] tolken#2655
Binance wallets estimated more like 3-4mil, but who‚Äôs knows if those were the right ones.

[05-Sep-19 08:38 AM] tolken#2655
So dump now?

[05-Sep-19 08:38 AM] tolken#2655
Thems were the rules.

[05-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
ok so if there is 15M on binance, the monthly claim is about 62500 KMD, plus the 250k giveaway, so they gave out like 312k KMD or so for the month.  So having 1500 KMD on there would give about 30 KMD as a reward.  So the reward is about 2% of your KMD stack

[05-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Alexfrog#1338
thats my estimate

[05-Sep-19 08:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Shit payout for risking your stack on a CEX

üëÜ 

[05-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, tolken if you thought there was 3M KMD on binance, but theres really 15M, then your reward is about a fifth what you expected

[05-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so that makes sense

[05-Sep-19 08:40 AM] tolken#2655
Yea, had I estimated that low I wouldn‚Äôt have risked it. Glad to have it off there now.

[05-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i think that a ton of addresses are binance addresses but we dont know it

[05-Sep-19 08:41 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the giveaway was worth about 4 months of staking rewards

[05-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but yes, now we should withdraw definitely

[05-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
since there is no extra benefit for having it on binance
