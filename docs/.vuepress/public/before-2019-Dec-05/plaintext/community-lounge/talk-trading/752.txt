[07-Jun-19 11:13 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[07-Jun-19 11:15 PM] gcharang#6833
yes

[07-Jun-19 11:15 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[07-Jun-19 11:26 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213

[07-Jun-19 11:26 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
is it better to keep ARRR on PirateOcean or Agama?

[08-Jun-19 03:36 AM] CyberTrucker#5260
@FlyingDutchman Verus Agama with support for more coins just released a few min ago. I personally like the interface of Agama more than my pirate ocean wallet

[08-Jun-19 04:36 AM] manugarc#3097
@Asher has just posted a new NON-MANDATORY release of the Verus Enhanced Agama wallet with native and SPV support for more coins, including Verus (of course), KMD, ARRR, a number of popular ERC20 tokens, K64, and ZEXO. We pushed hard to get out this release as a safe GUI alternative for many Komodo family coins.Most Komodo family coins are supported in both native and SPV modes. Please make sure if you're moving to Verus Enhanced Agama from the Komodo Agama wallet that you do not reuse your old keys, and instead create a new wallet with new keys.
This release adds a lot of new coins and although it prepares for PBaaS, does not include the PBaaS features that are running on testnet now. For testing, you should visit the #pbaas-development channel and start with the PBaaS Technology Preview.
Again, Verus Agama was never affected by the recent vulnerability in Komodo Agama, so although we are quite happy with this upgrade is it NOT MANDATORY.
Thanks to @michaeltoutjr and @Asher and everyone who helped for pushing to get this out quickly with more support for our friends across the Komodo ecosystem.

_keeps trying to tell people to sell based on buy value and not pure BTC "value"_

[08-Jun-19 09:58 AM] Caglio#3337
But btc gonna go up, and other coins gonna bleed

[08-Jun-19 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Time to make a move on ARRR I think

[08-Jun-19 09:58 AM] Caglio#3337
I dont have arrr on binance

[08-Jun-19 09:58 AM] Caglio#3337
Bah, anyway I am sad

less than 100,000 KMD left under 24000 sats

[08-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Should one want to pump the price and make bots go mad

[08-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would suggest using bittrex

[08-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
A lot less kmd to buy under 30k even

[08-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[08-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But bittrex is a piece of shit exchange so yeah

[08-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
basically the hack didnt change the price action much at all, cant even tell when it happened by looking at any chart longer than a few hours timeframe

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Well we got publicity

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD had just started to breakout and rise when the hack happened.   We are going up now, it only delayed it a couple days.  (Had the Komodo team not responded so well to the hack though, things would be different)

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess there was the initial panic sellers that dumped from 20k to 18k, now kicking themselves

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see any delay, or speedup, it is as if it didnt happen

[08-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I panic sold 20k and rebought lower üòÑ

[08-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but yeah, all the hack ended up doing is shaking the tree hard, throwing off the last few weak hands

[08-Jun-19 10:11 AM] Caglio#3337
@Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô sure

[08-Jun-19 10:14 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`But btc gonna go up, and other coins gonna bleed`
If BTC rises 20% and CoinX/BTC goes down 19% then CoinX actually rose more than BTC

[08-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Caglio#3337
Yeah, still if BTC rises 20% and makes KMD bleed, Ill buy more KMD

[08-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Caglio#3337
But when I buy more KMD, then KMD will sink even more and ill kill myself

[08-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Caglio#3337
<--- worst trader

[08-Jun-19 10:22 AM] Alexfrog#1338
BTC rising can only make KMD bleed if there are weak hands in KMD who will rush to swap it for BTC if BTC goes up.  At some point every weak hand has been so thoroughly shaken out that every coin is left in strong hands who refuse to sell until the price rises significantly.    And I'm convinced we hit that point at 14k.
