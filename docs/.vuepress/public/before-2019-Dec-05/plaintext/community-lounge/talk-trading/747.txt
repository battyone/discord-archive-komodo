Expect a dumpening, set your low bids

@blackjok3r you're the reason KMD syncs faster? I noticed the faster sync at one point and thought some of NN hardware was upgraded.

[05-Jun-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
@Hollowman9000 i have orders at 15k

No I spent literally hindreds of hours syncing rand chains from one VM to another for weeks to fix that

CCS wouldn't even work if if it's wasn't for me, half a block at 2mb, would stop deamon dead for a while

it's not just a hack. It's a meta scale coin shuffling, network stress test. Another first in crypto, brought to you by komodoplatform üòÄ

What amount of tx/s would be keen to show? LABS can do it....

[05-Jun-19 05:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
corss chain too...

[05-Jun-19 05:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I wrote python script that can process 5000 corss chain migrate tx per block np.

[05-Jun-19 05:29 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I wonder if the attacker had anything to do with the fake IBM twitter account. Wait for rebrand, hype up IBM partnership, take large amount of funds from people locking them up, pump to moon because of less sell pressure.

Best wear the matching suit as well... just to be safe.

[05-Jun-19 05:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
@actionslacks so does that mean that any wallet that doesn‚Äôt sync blockchains is vulnerable?  Because I have several wallets that don‚Äôt require syncing that are apparently more secure than Agama

[05-Jun-19 05:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
if your wallet only works with one coin it's probably a bit easier to keep secure as well

[05-Jun-19 05:32 PM] meatspoon#7860
Get outta here with that.

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Look at Exodus

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
Beautiful, intuitive, secure, multicoin.

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
i use jaxx quite a bit but I wouldn't hold much on it for long

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
havent seen exodus

[05-Jun-19 05:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'll check it out though

[05-Jun-19 05:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
may own tin foil hat theory as that this is espionage. It would be interesting to research how easy it is to get a vulnerability snuck into npm

[05-Jun-19 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
Seeing as how I have been using it for a long time and it‚Äôs been great, I will continue to keep a small portion of my crypto on it

[05-Jun-19 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
I hold in a few different wallets/methods so all eggs aren‚Äôt in one basket

[05-Jun-19 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
But Exodus is great example of slick UI design

[05-Jun-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
The Agama people seem to want to maximize clicks and selections and nonsense

[05-Jun-19 05:39 PM] meatspoon#7860
Really make the experience like sandpaper on the genitals

[05-Jun-19 05:40 PM] meatspoon#7860
Isn‚Äôt that closed source as well?

[05-Jun-19 05:41 PM] meatspoon#7860
None of this really changes the bottom line which is Komodo needs to get a secure wallet out there. They should be looking at wallets like Exodus for UI inspiration.

[05-Jun-19 06:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
The irony is that this community is so hard core about being one‚Äôs own bank and F CEX‚Äôs and F closed source stuff... but clearly history has just shown binance, coinbase, closed source wallets are all safer than what Komodo presents on their website as the solution of choice.

[05-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Duck Tape#9059
Binance got hacked multiple times

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ignoring binances recent hack or vulnerabilities found in closed source apps like Coinomi

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] SpraY#9508
even ETH got hacked

[05-Jun-19 06:04 PM] SpraY#9508
and it wasn't end of the world

[05-Jun-19 06:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
If Ethereum had an official website that endorsed a wallet with vulnerabilities, it would have been a huge deal. @SpraY

[05-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Vertigo#0439
Is ok the only wallet that lost funds is whalebro's... :5684_Peepo_Goteem:

[05-Jun-19 06:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
If Ethereum has a discord where their devs encouraged people to use a wallet with vulnerabilities, it would be a huge problem.

[05-Jun-19 06:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
ETH also isn‚Äôt a number 50 market cap coin. It can‚Äôt be dismissed as easily as KMD.

[05-Jun-19 06:20 PM] meatspoon#7860
Lots of people in here complain about lack of recognition for KMD. KMD‚Äôs reputation is a lot more delicate than ETH which is much more established.

[05-Jun-19 06:26 PM] Mark81#4505
If you are using third party libary then is it your fault if you get hacked for trusting third party on your end? Shit just like this is always possible.

[05-Jun-19 06:27 PM] Mark81#4505
It is same as you are using compromised computer for your wallets. Scale for incident just is different.

@Deleted User I hear ya.  I will try to choke back my irritation.  But this nonsensical comparison to ETH does not help.  We are the dude at the urinal with the tiny dick next to ETH whose phallus is so big it is curled up like a snake in the bottom of the urinal.  We can't make comparisons to ETH.... yet.

@Mark81 Its not at all like that, Mark.  Komodo endorses Agama.  Look on their website, look on the discord.  It is basically the official wallet of KMD.

You can deposit/Withdraw/trade Verus coin on DigitalPrice just of now.

[05-Jun-19 08:32 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Sometimes bad things happen. Didn't Binance lost like kadzillion BTC just a short while ago? But look at our Komodo heroes here - the exploitation was quickly discovered and brought out in the open; the security team saved a lot of people losing their funds by taking action immediately. Working their butts off, and everyone is collaborating; many of my fellow ecosystem developers reached out to each other. 

Some of you feel irritated, fear of horrible things happening. But the Komodo Team has always been resourceful. They have been at it non-stop. Here are at K64, they got our full support, our full confidence and heck, we will help to make ends meet. Do not worry. Just follow the good advice given from the posts; move your funds from Agama. Check your balance and verify if it was protected, use the form. 

Because together we are strong.

The KMD train doesn't appear to be stopping for anyone haha

[05-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD was clearly pushed down as hard as it could be, current holders are too strong.  Even this couldnt tank it any more.

[05-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Alexfrog#1338
this is just a buying opportunity now to get more before Antara

Johoe Strikes Again, Lifts More than 300 Bitcoins from ‚ÄòSecure...
The hacker known as ‚ÄúJohoe‚Äù has shown for the second time this week that he is one of the best by hacking into what Blockchain.info says are secure Bitcoin wallets. Today he skimmed more than 300 BTC.

oh yeah, i remember that

[05-Jun-19 11:30 PM] phm87#7395
My pool have XVG since a while and the reaction of XVG team was a disaster when their network/consensus got hacked. KMD took a very difficult decision that I support : they secured funds. In comparison, KMD team reaction was good and responsible while XVG reaction was trying to hide the problem, deny it and fix it poorly (they fucked their network twice testing in prod their random commits). All coins have problems/bugs/hacks and it is the coin team reaction that matters. I support KMD team decision in this case
