[25-Dec-18 09:13 PM] Tek#5253
i put some buy orders right above mr whale bro's

[25-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
its already back up there

[25-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[25-Dec-18 09:23 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, KMD is starting to look like the most bullish pair

[25-Dec-18 09:23 PM] ver_User#6608
KMDETH is worth watching closely IMO

[25-Dec-18 09:25 PM] ver_User#6608
As much as I hate the relentless head and shoulders calls in this space, "inverse head and shoulders" setup looks reasonable, will be interesting if we break the neckline...

[25-Dec-18 09:27 PM] ver_User#6608
@Cryptoon for sure, it's a serious coin for serious players, 6 months of tight range would have allowed some very significant positions to be taken. I expect a breakout above these levels (should it come) to be quite explosive. That should "raise awareness" ;)

Downside is the chart would end up looking like ETH chart, which would be very exciting and great for anyone involved now, but also unsustainable. But that's crypto for the time being, BTCUSD has taken a long time to behave like a reasonable market, but it still moves XX% in a day at times.

@ver_User howmuch would you think one kmd would be if its really sucessful?

[25-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
no one really explained the economics of the coin yet tbh

[25-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
i just buy kmd cause I recognise gems in a pile of shit very well

[25-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Tek#5253
I also put some stakes on AION

[25-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
as platform contender

[25-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Tek#5253
then I have the DASH XMR and ZEC for "store of value/currency" and NANO for risky currency coin

[25-Dec-18 09:31 PM] ver_User#6608
@Tek I'm just staring at charts all day, and while I have been doing this for some time now, take what say with a pinch of salt. Also new to KMD market. 

If this is a medium term corrective inside the bear market, then we should see a good run in all altbtc pairs

[25-Dec-18 09:31 PM] ver_User#6608
100% + across the board

[25-Dec-18 09:31 PM] ver_User#6608
I like KMD for more than that

[25-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Tek#5253

[25-Dec-18 09:32 PM] ver_User#6608
watching BTCUSD closely for any reversals or resuming downtrend

[25-Dec-18 09:32 PM] ver_User#6608
as altbtc pumps will want to take their profits in btc sales for cash

[25-Dec-18 09:32 PM] ver_User#6608
anyways, my targets for KMD for now are 0.0005+ range

[25-Dec-18 09:33 PM] ver_User#6608
but if what I speculate is true, then we may not visit these levels again, at least for a looong time, and 10x or more is possible

[25-Dec-18 09:33 PM] Markus#5464
i believe btc will back up to 4k and then take a final step below 3.5k before it starts growing back up again

[25-Dec-18 09:34 PM] Tek#5253
I think the stock market is gonna tank and everyone will put it in cryptos.

[25-Dec-18 09:34 PM] Tek#5253
its what I would do if i'd be able to exit the top with a huge sum of gains

[25-Dec-18 09:34 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, zooming out, BTCUSD took Jan - Aug 2015 to truly bottom, we would have to expect a range from here still

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ver_User#6608
ranging is the market makers playground

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ver_User#6608
and pro traders

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Tek#5253
I also think bitcoin is going to become less relevant

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Markus#5464
NI225 stock dropped 5% almost instantly

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] Markus#5464

[25-Dec-18 09:35 PM] ver_User#6608
it's a nice thing to fantasise about.... crypto bubble within equities bear market üòâ

[25-Dec-18 09:36 PM] ver_User#6608
I'm on the fence as to the doom porn that's around right now, it's too easy to call

[25-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Tek#5253
I'm thinking about going all in the next year

[25-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Tek#5253
I mean dca myself all in over the course of 2019

[25-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
I either win my freedom to not have to wage slave for life, or lose 2 years of savings

[25-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
what do you think about that ?

[25-Dec-18 09:37 PM] ver_User#6608
haha

[25-Dec-18 09:37 PM] ver_User#6608
ethically, I have no comment

[25-Dec-18 09:37 PM] Tek#5253
I want to buy a farm and start doing permaculture

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Tek#5253
but i don't have the capital, i would have it if I go all in and crypto moons.

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Markus#5464
accumulate bit by bit, now is a good time to start and if it drops to ~3k then buy more so u dont miss out xD

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Tek#5253
i've honestly been buying all year

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Tek#5253
every month

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Tek#5253
I did sell january though

[25-Dec-18 09:38 PM] Tek#5253
I lost a lot of money this year

[25-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Tek#5253
I also bought a luxury car which I kinda regret, I mean its nice

[25-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Tek#5253
but

[25-Dec-18 09:39 PM] Markus#5464
well u have to see it like this....as long as u dont sell u never lose...if u had 3 btc u still have 3 btc so btc wise u didnt lose anything, it will rise back up eventually and ur usd will return to where it was

[25-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Tek#5253
NEO seems bottomed too

[25-Dec-18 09:40 PM] Tek#5253
if btc doesn't drop further

[25-Dec-18 09:41 PM] Tek#5253
I think that btc will become less and less relevant over the coming years

[25-Dec-18 09:41 PM] Tek#5253
core destroyed it

[25-Dec-18 09:41 PM] ver_User#6608
personally, I think 2017 was major confirmation for crypto, even just breaking $300 was massive, but we now have absolute interest and are taken seriously across the board. Corrective has been reasonable so far, anything from this point is worth thinking seriously about for the long term, rewards are lower risk than they ever were (pre 2017). Rewards may not be as high, but risk is less IMO. Something like KMD has a higher reward profile, as I mentioned previously, it should have more "room to grow" relative to other cryptos. I also love Verus on that front too, very serious lead dev, great niche project, etc

[25-Dec-18 09:42 PM] Markus#5464
we will see, big companies would promote btc over any other coin. look at bakkt  for example

[25-Dec-18 09:42 PM] Tek#5253
I've been following the Bitcoin SV a bit

[25-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Tek#5253
they managed a 64mb block and 1500 TPS in private benchmarks

[25-Dec-18 09:43 PM] ver_User#6608
it's the year to think very seriously about going all in, yes, for sure...

alts are very tricky, I only look short term and try to think long term possiblities and let the short term guide those ideas

[25-Dec-18 09:43 PM] Tek#5253
so as fast as ripple

[25-Dec-18 09:43 PM] ver_User#6608
what is reasonable? eth 10000%? who would have thought...

[25-Dec-18 09:44 PM] Markus#5464
we will probably see eth 1000-2000$ again next bull run even if there is other projects that are way better but ppl recognise eth as a larger player since its been in the game longer

[25-Dec-18 09:45 PM] Markus#5464
sad but true üòÑ

[25-Dec-18 09:45 PM] ver_User#6608
for now, bull cycle medium term (maybe even only weeks) is a reasonable assumption IMO, but personally I look to take profits somewhere and wait for the next resolution to show it's hand on what's the next best plan

[25-Dec-18 09:48 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah, vague projections like BTC 100k, and ethbtc at 0.2 psychological ceiling for now... I wouldn't be surprised if ETHUSD hits the 10k mark one day

literally anything is possible long term, but next large wave for crypto is still a good bet and one of the safer times to bet on it IMO. Once that cycle has shown it's evolution, then we can start to make more informed judgements

[25-Dec-18 09:50 PM] ver_User#6608
This speculative idea of someone like CZ

[25-Dec-18 09:50 PM] ver_User#6608
looking at something like kmd as a big bet, it's a fair assumption

[25-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Tek#5253
some dude a few days ago said he wanted to buy in big OTC

[25-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Tek#5253
and was looking for places

[25-Dec-18 09:50 PM] Tek#5253
i said you can probably do it in the kmd discord

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Tek#5253
then I left the thread

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Tek#5253
maybe its him

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] ver_User#6608
find value, undervalued value

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Markus#5464
well we are overbought now

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] ver_User#6608
it's how investors work

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Markus#5464
will probably pullback

[25-Dec-18 09:51 PM] ver_User#6608
kmd is one of those projects...

[25-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Tek#5253
I bought some 0x

[25-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Tek#5253
chart looks like its either ognna pump atleast 50%

[25-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Tek#5253
or slowly dump

[25-Dec-18 09:53 PM] ver_User#6608
yeah... it's a decent base, that's all I can say, altbtc pairs flatline for a long time, then they explode

[25-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Tek#5253
check the 0x is about to pump

[25-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Tek#5253
order book in binance is fat on the buy side

[25-Dec-18 09:54 PM] ver_User#6608
sometimes it takes longer than expected to finish flatlining, so yeah, maybe I'm early, personally I am optimistic, otherwise I wouldn't be here üòâ

2019 is comparable to our 1st teen year. think back to 2010 when expression and sensitivity ruled (#3) and in our crypto youth, much playfulness and adventure enveloped growth. This new 10 yr cycle has laid a solid base at 3000+ but this time round at #3 should prove more mature leading to a solid ‚Äòstep-by-step process‚Äô at #4 (2020) 
Numerologically, 2019 will be charged with an ability to exceed expectations if we can simply understand the principles that brought us all here to begin with. Jl777 embodies the mindset given his inclusive approach to technology
