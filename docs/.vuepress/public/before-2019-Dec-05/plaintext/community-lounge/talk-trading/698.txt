jews are a race AND judaism is a religiion

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
different things, although quite interwined

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] Tek#5253
you racist! there is only one race

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] Alexfrog#1338
btc can just go up and down 500 bucks over and over and make alts tank 😛

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] Tek#5253
the human race!

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] Tek#5253
I am going to sue you

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] Tek#5253
you forgot we are POLITICALLY CORRECT HERE

[29-May-19 08:19 PM] JimD#9272
I think if we split human populations long enough we could create new species that could not interbreed

[29-May-19 08:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i dont think saying jewish people are a race is bad, or is it?

[29-May-19 08:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`jews are a race AND judaism is a religiion`
Explain that to my South African Jewish 4th cousin whose entire bloodline never went north more than 80 miles

[29-May-19 08:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no idea about the differences. I always thought there are jewish people as a race and there are jewish that practices judaism but are not of jew race

[29-May-19 08:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
also there are jew who dont practice judaism

[29-May-19 08:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I guess if you interbreed long enough it *could* be clasified as a new race 🤷🏽

[29-May-19 08:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
someone say jew?

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
we're good ppl

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but is it a race?

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
yes its a race

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] Tek#5253
wait 🤔

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] actionslacks#4072

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or is there political discrepancies about that?

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's not actually 😜

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's a race and I win because I have a fast car

[29-May-19 08:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
it's all down to yo momma

[29-May-19 08:25 PM] Alexfrog#1338

[29-May-19 08:26 PM] Alexfrog#1338
whalebro needs 10M KMD in order to buy 100M pirate ;P

[29-May-19 08:26 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I sold at 1770`
How did you sell something you didn't have or did you buy back at a loss and now pretending that you made more than 4 cents?

[29-May-19 08:26 PM] Tek#5253
uh

this guy 🤣 21 hrs ago he sold all his KMD hoping for 10k **USD** BTC and now he magically sold again without buying 🤣

[29-May-19 08:28 PM] Markus#5464
@Tek Whalebro most likely just leverage his btc on bitmex and then bring profits to buy kmd on binance

[29-May-19 08:28 PM] Tek#5253
> all

[29-May-19 08:28 PM] Tek#5253
i dindt sell all

[29-May-19 08:28 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:33 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
will IEOs be possible on DEXs?

[29-May-19 08:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hyperDEX I can't help myself, he's all "pleb this" and "pleb that" making $25 trades for 9 cents; that shit's just to funny to let walk

[29-May-19 08:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We are not a exchange 😄

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253
whats more funny is you getting hacked

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253
and losing crypto

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well not a custodial one, we have dICOs already

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253
but you deserved it

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Alexfrog#1338
so is the ComputerGenie vs Tek hostility a common thing here?

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253
and you deserve the next hack too

[29-May-19 08:34 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never got hacked, I gave myself a worm (there's a difference)
and unlike you, I can drop 29k KMD and go back to trading when I get up the next day 🤣

[29-May-19 08:35 PM] Tek#5253
> I gave myself a worm
so your opsec sucks

[29-May-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 yeah i know, but when you get responses from them like that best to let them cool off, when more and more people join we have to class up the channel a tiny bit

[29-May-19 08:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
fuck

[29-May-19 08:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Tek not doing yourself any favors here....

[29-May-19 08:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`so your opsec sucks`
Did I ever say otherwise? It was a workstation and I didn't care

[29-May-19 08:36 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:36 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's really the best comeback you've got? "insulting" my manhood? really?

[29-May-19 08:37 PM] Tek#5253
thats what left of it yes.

[29-May-19 08:38 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:38 PM] Tek#5253

[29-May-19 08:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
