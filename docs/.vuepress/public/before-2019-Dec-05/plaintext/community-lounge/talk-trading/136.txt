[05-Sep-18 03:47 PM] FundazuSafu#1169

[05-Sep-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

i like to know a guy like that because they are usually good guinea pigs for stuff. reminds me of a buddy from high school who would take any pill you handed him.

[05-Sep-18 03:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I knew an idiot like that in middle school

[05-Sep-18 03:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We all snuck out to toke up

[05-Sep-18 03:52 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
my buddy did the same thing!

[05-Sep-18 03:52 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
loved those high blood pressure coricidin and lopressors

[05-Sep-18 03:53 PM] FundazuSafu#1169
you need those at 14, right?

[05-Sep-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe they‚Äôd get lightheaded due to extreme low BP

[05-Sep-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[05-Sep-18 03:53 PM] FundazuSafu#1169

Top 25 addresses have like 40% of the KMD coin supply

[05-Sep-18 04:05 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not really that surprising the binance ‚Äúwhale‚Äù got crushed

[05-Sep-18 04:09 PM] snowdamn#2414
BTC barely below $7k and ETH dumps even lower, ideal plan still in effect!!! üçæ

I really dont get the fuss over a 300$ drop in btc

[05-Sep-18 04:33 PM] snowdamn#2414

Yeah, what scum to tell people that a $19k BTC was a bubble üòï

[05-Sep-18 04:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, not convinced that a tradingdesk is the best thing for crypto, would only induce more manipulation I think

Anyone in the US looking for a server workstation for KMD?

[05-Sep-18 10:54 PM] jspook16#3059
what does that mean? like hardware?

[05-Sep-18 11:02 PM] bishop#9773
yep

[05-Sep-18 11:05 PM] bishop#9773
HP Z820 Specs: 2 x Xeon E5-2670v1 2.6GHz CPUs, 96GB DDR3 (Samsung), Quadro 4000 GPU. Has trays, most likely wouldn't include hdds although might consider

[05-Sep-18 11:07 PM] bishop#9773
Heavier than all hell

[05-Sep-18 11:10 PM] jspook16#3059
does it come with power supplie(s)?

[05-Sep-18 11:10 PM] bishop#9773
Yep, would be turnkey w/ hdds

[05-Sep-18 11:11 PM] bishop#9773
No problems with one of the notaries/team escrowing the funds to anyone interested should you wish too

[05-Sep-18 11:14 PM] bishop#9773
Oh, ram is 10600R speed, 8GB x 12 sticks leaving 4 slots open

[05-Sep-18 11:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
2.6Ghz is a bit piss poor, but thats CHEAP! and much much faster than what I am using now...

[05-Sep-18 11:43 PM] bishop#9773
US only, shipping would be prohibitively expensive anything other than the lower 48

[05-Sep-18 11:45 PM] bishop#9773
One sec, I can check the meter

[05-Sep-18 11:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol I missread even what CPUs those were... I doubt thats much better than the server I have, only this in it could actually miner verus.

[05-Sep-18 11:48 PM] bishop#9773
460w maxing out 32 threads

[05-Sep-18 11:49 PM] bishop#9773
Depending on the colo, yes, it could, but the size would be 1/8 rack

[05-Sep-18 11:49 PM] bishop#9773
~5U of space

[05-Sep-18 11:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that would not be worth it üòõ

[05-Sep-18 11:51 PM] bishop#9773
depends entirely on location. It's going to be more than a standard 2U

[05-Sep-18 11:51 PM] bishop#9773
or 1U server

[05-Sep-18 11:52 PM] bishop#9773
just figured I would throw it out there. Not entirely sure I want to part it yet but I did get a firesale upgrade so naturally having a second doesn't make a ton of sense for me personally

[05-Sep-18 11:55 PM] bishop#9773
not really trading talk (well, kinda from a hardware for KMD standpoint), but if anyone is interested, DM me.

I have a feeling that bitmex is going down soon

[06-Sep-18 01:01 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
33% of btcusd volume is bitmex derivatives

[06-Sep-18 01:13 AM] Redbeard#8343

I think ETH DEed. In all seriousness we saw the bottom of the cloud but maybe didn't see the ground.

[06-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Bowdo#4054
Ouch.  Pretty rough out there.

[06-Sep-18 03:48 AM] ryman112#0068
Im growin older faster than I should watching this nonsense....yet I find solice in the way it makes me feel.  Maybe I have hope maybe I have none.  It gets to you mentally in a strong way but I was raised by a strong ass mother and I will always stay by what I believe in and if it runs into the ground like so many things I have seen before then so be it.  It will be the status quo.  Sorry for the rant but I see things as an average and I am very logical about decisions.  The older I get the more I realize how ignorant the people really are.  Im done now.
