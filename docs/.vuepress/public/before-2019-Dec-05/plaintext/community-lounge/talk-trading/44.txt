Though pretty new, two UK enterprises are now accepting Onni for their businesses because it s a stable coin that is not heavily fluctuating. The future is bright! On BarterDEX, 1 ONNI=0.0049 BTC   1 ONNI=0.0667 ETH  Swapping  between ONNI and your favorite currency is welcomed.

[04-Jul-18 10:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
_is too lazy to restart his GUI to add ONNI_

Interesting fact. If anyone had purchased $100 of Bitcoin each day the Mayer Multiple was <1 since 2011-09-05 to 2018-06-28 $75,600 would have been invested. 4,504 Bitcoins would now be owned worth $27,924,800 Fees excluded. @TraceMayer @TIPMayerMultple

Interesting observation

[04-Jul-18 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Although it’s something we could have seen coming

[04-Jul-18 10:21 AM] Jazzy#0001
What'st the point in backtesting so far

[04-Jul-18 10:22 AM] Jazzy#0001
You could change the entry criteria to any number of things and produce equally stellar results because of buying $100 worth of BTC any time pre-2013

[04-Jul-18 10:23 AM] Jazzy#0001
Heck even if you just start from say Jan 2016 that's still only accounting for a massive bull market until recently

[04-Jul-18 10:23 AM] Jazzy#0001
And then you'd start to sink money every day since like feb?

[04-Jul-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it'd take a bigger dive than this to reduce what I bought in mid '16 and sold last Dec

[04-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Utrum crushed way below bonus ICO level

[04-Jul-18 10:36 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
Onni is on BarterDEX 1.1.0 -the latest release

[04-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Who dumps like that?

[04-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Especially considering your likely not the run of the mill chucklehead if you participated

[04-Jul-18 10:37 AM] ch6ris#5240
Yeah I didn't particpate. Felt like a cash or komodo grab to me.

I cashed in a shitcoin stash to participate

[04-Jul-18 10:38 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
@ComputerGenie   what is the situation with the GUI?

[04-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not overly concerned

[04-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just mystified

[04-Jul-18 10:38 AM] ch6ris#5240
Sorry what gui?

[04-Jul-18 10:39 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
BarterDEX GUI

[04-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@ComputerGenie is a GUI dev now?

[04-Jul-18 10:40 AM] ch6ris#5240
What's wrong with the gui?

[04-Jul-18 10:41 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
There is nothing wrong with the GUI, just that @ComputerGenie mentioned is  lazy...

[04-Jul-18 10:42 AM] ch6ris#5240
Ohh. 🤔

[04-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Ah

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
You have to update the GUI for new coins

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
yes

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
They’re coded in

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
just download the latest release

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
He doesn’t feel like updating the GUI to see onni

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Aka

[04-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not interested

[04-Jul-18 10:46 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
no, not sure what he meant

[04-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
He essentially told you to fuck off in a joking way

[04-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That’s @ComputerGenie

[04-Jul-18 10:47 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
When you add a new coin in your list, you need to logout and close. Then restart again. This can be done at any time

[04-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Regardless, it begs the question, is there a bdex mod that can allow for automatic listing of pairs?

[04-Jul-18 10:48 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
He said he is lazy to do that

[04-Jul-18 10:48 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
No there is no automatic listing

[04-Jul-18 10:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I understand that

[04-Jul-18 10:48 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not a coder nor am I aware of the current functioning of bdex

[04-Jul-18 10:49 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Just asking is such a thing possible?

[04-Jul-18 10:49 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
It is possible but have to be coded in

Yes it is possible. But may be not needed. Check out the Bdex 1.1.0  and see how it goes. Some improvements from last version

[04-Jul-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
How about fekers quit feken tagging me at feken random?

[04-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[04-Jul-18 11:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[04-Jul-18 11:02 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171

[04-Jul-18 11:03 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Hmm.. no filters here

[04-Jul-18 11:04 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
@[TPUX] Djith Wattignies  can you  swap some  of your KMD with us on BarterDEX?

[04-Jul-18 11:04 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Im hodling

[04-Jul-18 11:05 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
Ok...

[04-Jul-18 11:05 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
But swapping for what?

[04-Jul-18 11:05 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
swap for eth

[04-Jul-18 11:06 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Hehe.. i mine ether and swap it for kmd 😂

[04-Jul-18 11:06 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
really?

[04-Jul-18 11:06 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Yeah.. that way i get more kmd than if i was mining it straight away

[04-Jul-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
what fool would give up their KMD for some shitty ETH?

[04-Jul-18 11:07 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
thought it is more inexpensive to mine KMD than ETH

[04-Jul-18 11:07 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Yeah.. feken ether

[04-Jul-18 11:08 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
haha...

[04-Jul-18 11:08 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Nope.. it is equihash algo and consumes as much power as ethash algo on your cards

[04-Jul-18 11:08 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
If you clock and downvolt it properly

[04-Jul-18 11:08 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
ok..

[04-Jul-18 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
$:$ KMD has to hit $3.3 and ETH has to go to $926.5 to make the same gains

[04-Jul-18 11:09 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Someone told me that kmd would go to 17000$ 🤤😲

[04-Jul-18 11:10 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Was on telegram..

[04-Jul-18 11:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[04-Jul-18 11:10 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
Thats ok

[04-Jul-18 11:10 AM] [TPUX] Djith Wattignies#3171
My digital brain will still work then

[04-Jul-18 11:11 AM] MISERICORDAE#3928
It is possible to rise  up to that value  ---it happened to BITCOIN  within 9 years
