not really decentralized

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Tek#5253
thtas not true

[30-May-19 04:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
i guess nothing wrong with dash as long as one isnt deluding themself into thinking its a privacy coin

[30-May-19 04:29 AM] Tek#5253
its actually one of the most decentralized cones

[30-May-19 04:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
I don't want to badmouth your investment decisions

[30-May-19 04:29 AM] Tek#5253
dash does one of the best for decentralization

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] Tek#5253
im confident in my investmens cause I buy based on fundamentals and progress

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] Tek#5253
dash has huge progress just like kmd

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
all comes from history of DASH- had two rebrands, Darkcoin, then Blcakcoin,- then DASH ...

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] Tek#5253
KMD had tons of rebrands too

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
then there was this hidden premine-

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
rebrand is not bad per se

[30-May-19 04:30 AM] Tek#5253
there was a premine but not hidden

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] LocoMB#8593
and DASH sure has perfect marketing

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
The dash guy is like caucassian tron

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
who cares what happened the first week 4 years ago?

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
> muh premine

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
lmao

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] LocoMB#8593
don't they have masternodes?

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
yeah, they do

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
thats why they have instant transactions

[30-May-19 04:31 AM] Tek#5253
and chain locks ( anti 51%)

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
there was a time whern that sort of was like .. you have to buy in with a lot to cash out

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] Alexfrog#1338
actually it was hidden, they tried to deny it for a while

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] Tek#5253
its on bitcointalk

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
thanks! - I was not sure about it

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] Tek#5253
they didn't hide it

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] Tek#5253
anyway it doesn't matter what happened in the past. im looking at what they put out now

[30-May-19 04:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
they did try to hide it and then tried to weasel out of trying to hide it

[30-May-19 04:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
well - just be sure to not put all eggs in one basket

[30-May-19 04:33 AM] Tek#5253
you can be sure dash will be very big and succesful

[30-May-19 04:33 AM] Alexfrog#1338
only Dash fans believe that they didnt have a premine and try to hide it üòõ

[30-May-19 04:33 AM] LocoMB#8593
but the thing with the masternodes does not go well with decentralizeatioin I think#

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] Tek#5253
without masternodes you can't have instant transactions

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
dash is a wallet. kmd is an ecosystem. they arent on the same planet

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] Tek#5253
safe instant transactions

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
still doesn't help with the power the masternodes have

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] Tek#5253
so without masternodes your crypto currency is useless for retail buys

[30-May-19 04:34 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Which is why all coins are pumping

[30-May-19 04:35 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Dash will always be inferior to Monero, this will never change. üòÑ

[30-May-19 04:35 AM] Tek#5253
> 0-conf isn't safe

[30-May-19 04:35 AM] Tek#5253
BCH is building a masternode overlay called Avalanche

[30-May-19 04:35 AM] Tek#5253
the dao is fuckin awesum

[30-May-19 04:35 AM] Tek#5253
ya'll jelly hatelets

[30-May-19 04:36 AM] LocoMB#8593
and I think the anonymity aspect of DASH has its holes too- again, don't want to badmouth your stuff Tek, just venting  old resentments against DASH

[30-May-19 04:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
so jelly

[30-May-19 04:36 AM] Tek#5253
the anon of dash is like the anon of any other crypto currency that doesn't use zero proof knowledgegs

[30-May-19 04:36 AM] Tek#5253
its a huge tumbler

[30-May-19 04:37 AM] Tek#5253
you can use it in a way its safe but you can also pick an anonymity set of 3 or 4

[30-May-19 04:37 AM] Tek#5253
then you aren't safe

[30-May-19 04:38 AM] LocoMB#8593
marketing of DASH has very successfully catered to americans- with their tax critters from IRS and all that, and Amandas videos

[30-May-19 04:38 AM] Tek#5253
dash also has a legal office in australia now

[30-May-19 04:38 AM] Tek#5253
and an investment fund

[30-May-19 04:38 AM] Alexfrog#1338
Dash is the best coin at making marketing videos with girls in them

[30-May-19 04:38 AM] cachey#1337
target?

[30-May-19 04:39 AM] LocoMB#8593
indeed- Amanda is perfect, brainy nerd, female Spock

[30-May-19 04:39 AM] Tek#5253
I like Heidi better, manda too much make up

[30-May-19 04:39 AM] LocoMB#8593
and then they had one of the Baldwin brothers and the DASh bus .. 
yeah Amanda sometimes was a bit too spock-ish

[30-May-19 04:40 AM] Alexfrog#1338
I prefer to invest in cryptos based on tech though, not what girls are in their marketing videos üòõ

[30-May-19 04:40 AM] Tek#5253
quick shills

[30-May-19 04:41 AM] Alexfrog#1338
monero should make a marketing video with fluffypony dressed as a girl.  that would be hilarious üòÑ

[30-May-19 04:41 AM] Tek#5253
did you see the girl that does the marketing for south america

[30-May-19 04:41 AM] Tek#5253

[30-May-19 04:42 AM] Tek#5253
wait I link you

[30-May-19 04:42 AM] LocoMB#8593
for my taste, DASH is far too centralized and exposed to being stomped on by IRS- just keep an eye for that @Tek and be ready to bail before the have a problem

[30-May-19 04:42 AM] Tek#5253
my buy in is from 80 eur to 120 eur

[30-May-19 04:42 AM] Tek#5253

lmao

[30-May-19 04:48 AM] Tek#5253
next update of dash will be the one that will kickstart mass usage

[30-May-19 04:48 AM] Tek#5253
they will have blockchain usernames

[30-May-19 04:48 AM] Tek#5253
so you can pay @username instead of getting an adress or QR code

[30-May-19 04:52 AM] Tek#5253
its unironically called "Evolution"

[30-May-19 04:52 AM] Alright#0419
@Tek are you aware that CCs support both instant sends via payments CC and "blockchain usernames" via dilithium CC?

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
eth did that. no one ever uses .eth addresses

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
i bought a couple

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] Tek#5253
.eth is dns

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] Tek#5253
not username

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] Tek#5253
@Alright i don't understand this quistion im sorry

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
the tech you're boasting about that DASH has

[30-May-19 04:53 AM] Alright#0419
is supported on komodo assetchains via CCs

[30-May-19 04:54 AM] Tek#5253
cc?

[30-May-19 04:54 AM] Alright#0419
custom consensus modules

[30-May-19 04:54 AM] Tek#5253
oh

[30-May-19 04:54 AM] Tek#5253
nice

[30-May-19 04:55 AM] Tek#5253
i wasn't aware of that

[30-May-19 04:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah komodo doesnt making marketing videos with girls in them to tell you üòõ

[30-May-19 04:57 AM] Tek#5253
m pretty sure theres more than just usernames. they have been working on this "evolution" for 2 years now

[30-May-19 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
the "usernames" are an added feature to the dilithium CC which is for quantum secure transactions

[30-May-19 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
just an after thought of quantum resistance CC module üòÇ
