we unfortunately  we are dependant on btc movements , as long as it continues like that we are what we are.

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Buddz1993#5380
how many times did that guy appeared since I can remember

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Tek#5253
we don't know,

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Tek#5253
there's been 300 btc orders too

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Tek#5253
a few months ago

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Tek#5253
huge huge orders

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Buddz1993#5380
he by now must have like 1 % of supply

[01-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Buddz1993#5380
lol

[01-Feb-19 05:16 PM] Alecandro#1179
yea he has appeared multiple times since September if I remember correctly

[01-Feb-19 05:16 PM] Buddz1993#5380
So , hes been cost averaging down

[01-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Tek#5253

[01-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
well I'm doing the same so we got that in common

[01-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
😄

[01-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Alecandro#1179
Pretty interesting.

[01-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Alecandro#1179
I like to think these volume candles have to do with him or them

[01-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
the good stuff is that we are prob one of the top most active cryptocurrency in the market , and that brings value not price value but trusting value

[01-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
and thats a big plus.

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
If theres a crazy guy to drop hundreds of btc into this he must be very confident also

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
Look at volume for KMD on the weekly timeframe and specifically look in October and December

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Buddz1993#5380
😃

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
largest volume weeks KMD has ever had on binance

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
10M in volume during those weeks

[01-Feb-19 05:19 PM] Alecandro#1179
pretty much almost at ATL's

[01-Feb-19 05:22 PM] yaheardme#2938
nothin guaranteed if that bid disappears a rock will drop

[01-Feb-19 05:23 PM] Alecandro#1179
well of course

[01-Feb-19 05:24 PM] yaheardme#2938
i'd for once like to see a 100 btc market buy of kmd😅

[01-Feb-19 05:24 PM] yaheardme#2938
that would make me chuckle

[01-Feb-19 05:24 PM] Alecandro#1179

[01-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I also noted that it wasn’t referred to in a pronoun-friendly/gender-neutral way aka “nakamoto/nakamota/nakamotx”

[01-Feb-19 08:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I am here to file a complaint

[01-Feb-19 08:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@Hollowman9000 did you pay fee to file the complaint? :troll:

[01-Feb-19 08:45 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Fees are discriminatory

[01-Feb-19 08:46 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I would also like to file a complaint for the filing a complaint fee

[01-Feb-19 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hollowman9000 All #safespace style complaints are handled by Ms. Waite; so after you pay the fee you should go to Helen Waite....
