[18-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ErikB#3019
My funds are gone

[18-Oct-18 10:36 AM] ErikB#3019
Nothing in the KMD wallet

[18-Oct-18 10:37 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
make sure to use the correct passphrase to login

[18-Oct-18 10:37 AM] ErikB#3019
i did

[18-Oct-18 10:37 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
it has to be the same, no spaces no special characters

[18-Oct-18 10:37 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
make sure you don't copy paste from sources that can have invisible characters

[18-Oct-18 10:38 AM] ErikB#3019
i wrote it down

[18-Oct-18 10:38 AM] bpkdasbaum#4592
also #support

[18-Oct-18 10:38 AM] Mic4cky#2874
don't scare off the üê≥  üòÅ

[18-Oct-18 10:38 AM] ErikB#3019
help me out

[18-Oct-18 10:39 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Did you do any trades @ErikB

[18-Oct-18 10:39 AM] ErikB#3019
yes

[18-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ErikB#3019
but i dont think i spent everything

[18-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ErikB#3019
i was buying up some chips

[18-Oct-18 10:40 AM] ErikB#3019
but now there's nothing and my deposit address has changed for KMD

[18-Oct-18 10:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if your deposit address has changed then im pretty sure you are logining into a different account,

[18-Oct-18 10:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
the seed is always linked to the same address

[18-Oct-18 10:41 AM] ErikB#3019
yeah

[18-Oct-18 10:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
have you checked ur original kmd address on the exploerer

[18-Oct-18 10:42 AM] ErikB#3019
yes

[18-Oct-18 10:42 AM] ErikB#3019
it's been sent over there

[18-Oct-18 10:42 AM] SHossain#0007
@ErikB if you see different address for KMD, that means you have used different or modified passphrase

[18-Oct-18 10:43 AM] ErikB#3019
classic

[18-Oct-18 10:43 AM] ErikB#3019
alright

[18-Oct-18 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
same passphrase will always show same address

[18-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ErikB#3019
gunna have to try some mess ups and see if i can get back in i guess

[18-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ErikB#3019
is there anyway support can do some unlocking? im guessing no

[18-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ErikB#3019
lol

[18-Oct-18 10:45 AM] ErikB#3019
dont even answer that question...

[18-Oct-18 10:45 AM] ErikB#3019
thanks guys

[18-Oct-18 10:45 AM] ErikB#3019
KMD is more scarce today

[18-Oct-18 10:45 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Solid no, No one has access to ur funds unfortunatley / Fortunatley

[18-Oct-18 10:46 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
sometimes a space at the start of the seed is misplaced, Double check that

[18-Oct-18 10:47 AM] ErikB#3019
WAIT

[18-Oct-18 10:47 AM] ErikB#3019
I wrote down my BTC receive address for my private key upon my first loggin

[18-Oct-18 10:47 AM] ErikB#3019
And now it's different too!

[18-Oct-18 10:47 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
100% different seed

[18-Oct-18 10:48 AM] jorian#4555
do you have your private key?

[18-Oct-18 10:48 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
all the adress for coins are attached to the same seed

[18-Oct-18 10:48 AM] ErikB#3019
I know I haven't been logging into 3 seperate accounts today

[18-Oct-18 10:48 AM] ErikB#3019
Don't you get it though..?

[18-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
it's simple: only the same passphrase gives you the same addresses

[18-Oct-18 10:49 AM] ErikB#3019
I worte down my private key AND addresses

[18-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
well if you have your private key

[18-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
then nothing is lost, right?

[18-Oct-18 10:49 AM] jorian#4555
if you type your passphrase manually, make sure not even a space is added

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ErikB#3019
Yeah im aware of all this

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ErikB#3019
I just don't see how ive been logging into 3 seperate accounts

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jorian#4555
by using 3 different passphrases

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You could try the seed you have wrote down in agama to see what address you get, just to confirm

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have one privkey, you can use that to login to Agama lite mode for all coins to get access

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
try the private key as login

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that should work as passphrase to recover all other private keys

{Reactions}
üëÜüèΩ 

[18-Oct-18 10:50 AM] ErikB#3019
i will try agama too

[18-Oct-18 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
even BarterDEX will work with private key login

{Reactions}
üëç 

[18-Oct-18 10:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes the WIF as passphrase feature is what I used for staked.

[18-Oct-18 10:53 AM] ErikB#3019
pretty dissapointed as ive done everything right

[18-Oct-18 10:53 AM] ErikB#3019
couldve easily made a spelling mistake once, but my private key has been 100% written correctly

[18-Oct-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
whatever passphrase or piravatekey you have it will always give you the same address, which is 100% correct for that passphrase or privatekey

[18-Oct-18 10:57 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I had such problem once - it was space added in the end. Took me a while to find it.

[18-Oct-18 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007
one of my passphrase i typed `clarity` which was actually `clarify` and that generated a  new address. that is my mistake. can't be disappointed on Agama or BarterDEX or Ledger for that.

[18-Oct-18 10:58 AM] ErikB#3019
of course i cant blame someone for my own stupidity... I'm simply concerend because i wrote my BTC address down the VERY FIRST time i had access from the auto-generated login. AND NOW it's different

[18-Oct-18 10:58 AM] jorian#4555
that means you mistyped the very first time you entered your passphrase?

[18-Oct-18 10:59 AM] ErikB#3019
im basically suggesting there have been 3 seperate account logins (which is hard to believe)

[18-Oct-18 10:59 AM] jorian#4555
ctrl-c and ctrl-v are your friends here

[18-Oct-18 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
most of my were in that address. i was really upset that i lost majority of funds. but, upon checking multiple times, found my issue and got access to my funds with the right key

[18-Oct-18 10:59 AM] ErikB#3019
ill keep trying to fix it üòÉ

[18-Oct-18 10:59 AM] ErikB#3019
thanks guys

[18-Oct-18 11:03 AM] ErikB#3019
theres also now a problem with chips on barterdex

[18-Oct-18 11:04 AM] ErikB#3019
it says it "cant find chips"

[18-Oct-18 11:12 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
this is one of the reasons I think conditional rules would be useful - for example you could set that if you dont log into your wallet in 2 months the funds go to another address (your friend for example) or sth like that. Maybe smart contracts or CC allows that.

I forgot to type a letter by the way... üíÄ

[18-Oct-18 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
any single letter or empty space changes, that creates a completely different address
