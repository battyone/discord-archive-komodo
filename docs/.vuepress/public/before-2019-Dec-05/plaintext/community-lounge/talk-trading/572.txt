very nice @Acura

[23-Apr-19 08:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Deleted User to be fair I  can't find any indication that Cosmos requires validators to be companies, from all docs I've read it's open to anyone as long as they have the funds, the infrastructure and get voted in (within the total limit of 100 validators)

[23-Apr-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
once voted in, always in?

[23-Apr-19 08:38 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it PoS, so it's possible it will become an oligarchy

[23-Apr-19 08:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the 'zones' that is the equivalent of komodo assetchains, have their own rules and validators, but they seems strongly bounded to the main Cosmos hub, not the same independence you find in Komodo

[23-Apr-19 08:41 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think we'll see the same pattern seen previously: trying lock-in and to extract a rent from projects built on it, once they grow beyond a certain value

market acting exactly like previous bear market

[23-Apr-19 08:48 AM] Markus#5464
last bear market we reached 50 ma weekly and got rejected at that point and also had a golden cross in same moment, after that we had a 30% correction

[23-Apr-19 08:49 AM] Markus#5464
lets see if the correction part happens same way aswell

[23-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
its almost as if whales are painting the charts to exactly what they want you to see...

[23-Apr-19 08:56 AM] Malti#3948
if whales want to make us see a bear pattern, they want us to dump into their buy orders, right?

[23-Apr-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[23-Apr-19 08:58 AM] Markus#5464
most likely they would cause panic to make ppl and bots start to sell and then they start accumulating

[23-Apr-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why the market often does the exact opposite you were sure it was going to do

[23-Apr-19 09:00 AM] Malti#3948
but aren't we all agreeing that main trend is becoming more and more bullish?

[23-Apr-19 09:00 AM] Malti#3948
so, which means we are going dooown

[23-Apr-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
alot of manipulation in crypto space, whales can print a pattern what will make u think its bullish but its just a trap

[23-Apr-19 09:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
There was no resistance/support between 5000 and 6500 on the way down

[23-Apr-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why TA works, until doesnt

[23-Apr-19 09:03 AM] Markus#5464
@dukeleto  theres always moving averages and fib lvls

[23-Apr-19 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
so many TA professionals, but it's most just luck. I agree that TA can help avoid make bad entrace/exits

[23-Apr-19 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I am of the old school opinion, that trying to time the market repeatedly is a recipe for disaster

[23-Apr-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
its not luck if the whales are painting the expected TA patterns

[23-Apr-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
just to suck in the most money on the opposite side for their desired trade

[23-Apr-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
them whales are tricksters

[23-Apr-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
have we seen a "Bart" lately ?

[23-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Malti#3948
so jl is a trickster

[23-Apr-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
seems like we only go up now

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
the whales are trying to paint a picture for normal people to throw all their money in

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
then dip to 5K or 4K, buy it all up, and then the real bull comes

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] Malti#3948
sounds credible

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
i see the news stories already

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
"Bitcoin could be going back to 20K!!!!"

[23-Apr-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
all that garbage

[23-Apr-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the news has changed 180 over last few weeks

[23-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Malti#3948
indeed

[23-Apr-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
like there was some giant change

[23-Apr-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe LN finally works at scale?

[23-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Malti#3948
and if you ^put 'bitcoin' or 'cryptocurrency' in youtube, it's mostly "MOON SOON???" tags instead of "REKT"

[23-Apr-19 09:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
when we see new YT videos that say you can get rich mining overnight, that is when the real bull is here. So many sad YT videos of people that spend life savings on mining rigs that never broke even

[23-Apr-19 09:07 AM] Markus#5464
There was news yesterday tho that amazon support bitcoin payments through lightning network

[23-Apr-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
good luck to the average amazon shopper to use LN

[23-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Markus#5464
im not so familar with how LN work, is it good or bad?

[23-Apr-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
not easy to use, let's say that

[23-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Malti#3948
it was already discussed here i think

[23-Apr-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
AMZ thing just goes thru debt/credit card system

“There’s no direct merchant integration. However we’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard network and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction.” 

AKA: Just like Bitpay, you're really not paying the merchant of your choice with BTC.

[23-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Markus#5464
ah ye...and extra fees when u use bitpay are insane

[23-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Malti#3948
credits to @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[23-Apr-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
Last I heard, you must spend money to put it into your LN channel, to then use it to pay somebody

[23-Apr-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
ain't nobody going to do that when 1 click amazon ordering works

[23-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Markus#5464

alessio rastani still not bullish

[23-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Markus#5464
its almost expected that we will have a quite significant correction before the real bull market begin

[23-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Markus#5464
and its not even sure it have started even then

[23-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Markus#5464

[23-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Markus#5464

@Malti There is very little in this space that irks me more than people intentionally leaving an entire phrase out of the middle of a sentence for the sole purpose of chaining the meaning of the sentence.
>*You can pay for x with CoinY*
>*Sweat, I'm glad MerchantZ is getting into crypto*
>*Well, actually they aren't....[blablabla]....and then we pay them in USD*

And as an Ohio taxpayer, I can assure folks that there's a profound difference between:
\* Now you can pay your Ohio taxes in Bitcoin.
and
\* Ohio upholds that you can legally pay someone else's taxes in USD and assign the payment to them.

it's possible that PoS incentives will evolve in a de-facto rule as you said, for now I'm open minded

[23-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are a dedicated block producer, did you just transmit money?
