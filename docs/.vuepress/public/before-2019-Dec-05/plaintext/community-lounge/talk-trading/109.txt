How did Supernet acquire so many assets?

[20-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Hegelian#0018
Its like $100 million worth

[20-Aug-18 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
actually the net worth reduced down to about $2 mil in the last bear market and I decided to start doing some trading and got 100x gain overall

the supernet ICO was for about $4 mil, mostly in NXT, which it held onto for far too long.

[20-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Did you trade manually?

[20-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or made or bot or so?

[20-Aug-18 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
mostly got lucky with my ICO investments of IOTA, KMD, STRAT and managed to cashout about half the IOTA and STRAT to build up BTC reserve and increase KMD position. Mostly was too busy to be watching the market, so it allowed me to hodl until they were are nice valuations

[20-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Nice

[20-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Iota was a beast from ICO

[20-Aug-18 08:44 PM] jl777c#5810
picking 3 of the all time top 10 ICO returns did wonders to the supernet NAV

[20-Aug-18 08:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but now it is much harder as the capital base is much bigger and ICO are not what they used to be,etc

[20-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Yeah turning down the iota ICO was one of my biggest mistakes

[20-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But then again I probably would have dumped it early

Is it true that there wouldn't be a bch fork without jl777 because he wrote the replay protection?

[21-Aug-18 01:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not sure if saying there wouldn't be a fork,  but bch used a similar method to what James had come up with previously for 2way replay protection

[21-Aug-18 06:25 AM] Hegelian#0018
Are all the coins owned by supernet considered good tech or are some owned for other reasons?

[21-Aug-18 06:25 AM] Hegelian#0018

@Hegelian I think if supernet invested in it at one point or the other jl/others thought it was a solid investment. I doubt supernet will ever invest in the verge‚Äôs of this world.

[21-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362

You'll still find some people claiming 50k by the end of the year. Granted far fewer of them than nine months ago.

[21-Aug-18 12:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is what makes me think that next leg up will be a B wave, not a new ATH wave

[21-Aug-18 12:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but that is difficult to assure

[21-Aug-18 12:11 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I see. Always thought the bear we're in was the B wave which will later lead to a upward C.

Trying to sell 58.42 DEX and 1.79 SuperNET on barterdex with no luck for a long time.  If anybody is interested in buying them OTC please let me know.  I'll sell cheaper than highest bid on barterdex.

CHMEX offered me 510 KMD for the entire lot.  Thanks for that offer.  I'll sell to him unless anybody wants to offer more within the next day or two.  Please send PM or tag me if you're interested, thanks.

Hyperdex is not made for selling, it's only good for spot trades, the trades don't stay open if you want to keep an order up for selling

To keep trades open best to use the selling bot on barterdex, not sure about the mechanics of that one myself
