[21-Aug-18 05:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

weekly KMD/BTC seems to be so near breaking the downward trend.

[21-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah someone is keeping those shorts in check

[21-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or a group

[21-Aug-18 05:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Seems like the idea of whitlisted pubkeys at core code is picking up

[21-Aug-18 07:48 PM] JimD#9272
Does barter dex report volume on major exchanges or could you do atomic swaps all day at whatever price and not effect the price on major exchanges ?

[21-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@siu - Chainmakers what does it mean in laymen’s terms?

[21-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If volume is high enough arbitrage will occur and prices will move to the same price as on major exchanges @JimD

[21-Aug-18 07:50 PM] JimD#9272
whats the mechanism for that arbitrage though

[21-Aug-18 07:50 PM] JimD#9272
if I buy and hold and don't sell how would anyone know what price I atomic swapped at

[21-Aug-18 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
People buy low on one place and sell higher on the other

[21-Aug-18 07:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Price will move to equilibrium

[21-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lets say for example someone is buying btc/kmd at a higher rate than on cex

[21-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
People will buy on cex and sell on dex

[21-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Pushing up the price on cex because of buying

[21-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And dropping price on dex because of selling

[21-Aug-18 07:53 PM] JimD#9272
ya, I thought something like that is possible

[21-Aug-18 07:53 PM] JimD#9272
do what you want to be seen on cex and do what needs to be hidden on dex

[21-Aug-18 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's nothing "hidden", more often it's that people are too lazy to look anywhere other than coinmarketads

[21-Aug-18 07:56 PM] JimD#9272
how does market buy work on barter dex

[21-Aug-18 07:56 PM] JimD#9272
people just put in their sell orders and it matches it up ?

[21-Aug-18 07:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
you, quite literally, can't hide anything on a peer-2-peer live-blockchain tranfer system

[21-Aug-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's some behind the scenes math about how matches are made, but yes...
you post an offer and if someone else likes it, then they bid on it in return (like an auction)

[21-Aug-18 07:59 PM] JimD#9272
Ok, I need to play around with it more when I do my next transaction

[21-Aug-18 07:59 PM] JimD#9272
I know its live but is it still considered beta version ?

[21-Aug-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I don't think that it will ever be in a state of "completion" as it changes with the crypto space and whatever needs arise, so "beta" or not is a matter of perception

[21-Aug-18 08:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that being said, all of the GUIs are alpha or beta

[21-Aug-18 08:02 PM] JimD#9272
Do the KMD devs hook the other coins into barter dex or do the other coins have to actively put themselves in barter dex

[21-Aug-18 08:02 PM] JimD#9272
or do they have to co-operate

[21-Aug-18 08:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
both have/do happen

[21-Aug-18 08:02 PM] JimD#9272
ahh ok

[21-Aug-18 08:03 PM] JimD#9272
I do like how I can make multiple orders on from the same pool of coins

[21-Aug-18 08:03 PM] JimD#9272
that opens up some new strats

[21-Aug-18 08:04 PM] JimD#9272
I don't think binance let me have multiple orders out based off the same BTC

[21-Aug-18 08:04 PM] JimD#9272
I know cryptopia didn't

[21-Aug-18 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's the beauty in the simplicity of it all: until you send your coins out for an active trade, they are yours and you can offer to whoever for whatever

[21-Aug-18 08:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
CEXs don't do that because they are no longer your coins and all you have is a balance on a ledger

[21-Aug-18 08:05 PM] JimD#9272
ahh nice, definitely gonna play around with it

[21-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
most people don't realize that a CEX operates exactly like a bank

[21-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but, then again, most people don't realize how a bank functions

[21-Aug-18 08:06 PM] JimD#9272
bahaha, don't get me started

[21-Aug-18 08:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@Cryptoon what you mean about what it means in leymens terms?

[21-Aug-18 08:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the whitelisted pubkeys?

[21-Aug-18 08:17 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes

[21-Aug-18 08:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The komodo notary nodes are nodes with special priviledge to notarize and easy mining in the komodo network

[21-Aug-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The way you set that privilege on the blockchain is adding the pubkeys to the core code

[21-Aug-18 08:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In the EOS chain it works in a similar way

[21-Aug-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
people vote for the 21 pubkeys that can be block producers

[21-Aug-18 08:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in that case, people constantly vote to put or remove those privileges to the different pubkeys

[21-Aug-18 08:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In the case of this bitcoin fork with a government strapon attached to it, 200 pubkey where added to the core code to have the privilege of being the only miners in the network.

[21-Aug-18 08:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what is a govt strapon?

Thx for the explanation @siu - Chainmakers

[21-Aug-18 08:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
sure no problem.

[21-Aug-18 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Makes sense for a govt to control a blockchain like that

[21-Aug-18 08:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Surprised they need so many

[21-Aug-18 08:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That seems to be a trend in future chains

[21-Aug-18 08:32 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
komodo blockchains can be done in a way that it whitelist a pubkey to receive all mining fees to that node

$BTC USD Shorts - 
Rising and testing the ATH now. I see no short squeeze right now though. Formed a running flat structure suggesting one more 3 wave leg to around 45-50k before a getting squeezed.

since the govt just prints whatever amount of money it wants, why does it have to take it back from you?
