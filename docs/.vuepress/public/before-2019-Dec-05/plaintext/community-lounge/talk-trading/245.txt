Did the agama claim bug get fixed? Any latest versions of agama?

[24-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
is it if you dont claim for 30 days then no more interest will accrue

[24-Oct-18 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
or is it by day 30 no one gets any interest

[24-Oct-18 01:15 AM] tolken#2655
30 days and it won’t accrue

[24-Oct-18 01:16 AM] tolken#2655
I’m curious how it broke. Must be an electrum bug as I successfully used hat version of Agama while back.

[24-Oct-18 01:16 AM] Vertigo#0439
Oh so if we don't claim in 30 you don't get any more rewards?

It's probably an almost dead coin. And there is a Pump right now.

not really dead, but I don't find much use for this token in the long term. It remains my opinion

Would you guys consider setting up a live interview with some guy here Revv Nissan? His some Aussie bloke who is pretty much “the” go to for newcomers to crypto.

[24-Oct-18 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
And the coins he does decide to do coverage for seem to spread to a very very wide audience

Would’ve been nice if someone like him covered actual coin tech and explained the shit I’ve picked up lurking here in discord back when I came into crypto buying up shitcoins left right and centre

[24-Oct-18 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I know one of the blokes on his team for DBET was the one who got me into Komodo :yassinkomodo:  and he loves the fundamentals and explained everything to me back then. I’ll see if I can get in touch but if I am able to, would a live interview and overview of Komodo be something you guys would wanna do?

[24-Oct-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810

:yassinkomodo: you guys should look at those blue yeti mics or something decently cheap. I haven’t been watching the recent interviews but the mic quality could do with some upgrading from back then @benohanlon  😛 I’d gladly start a Komodo fund to buy some mics 😂
