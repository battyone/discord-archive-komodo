@jl777c in ur medium post u mention pirate swaps being possible also with zSPV is this in works or in consideration?

[10-Sep-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
zSPV has too many issues to combine it with atomic swaps

[10-Sep-19 10:49 AM] Markus#5464
hm okay

[10-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
not a issue

[10-Sep-19 10:53 AM] Markus#5464
If btc is 90% maybe kmd will be 1%!

[10-Sep-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the more there is talk of altcoin death, the closer to the bottom we are

Bit-Z is ranked 10th highest exchange on @CoinMarketCap 

Almost 50% of the fake volume is from stable coins wash trading against another stable coin USDT.

CoinMarketCap and their crimes against the crypto ecosystem.

stats seem to be down.

[10-Sep-19 12:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Yes another article claims altcoins are dead , why so many recently

[10-Sep-19 12:18 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
Really makes you think

[10-Sep-19 12:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I missed those when alts where dropping 10 % daily

[10-Sep-19 12:20 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
🤔

[10-Sep-19 12:25 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
yes, lot of altsdead articles lately. maxis want monopoly on blockchain and they use propaganda and commanding market dominance to their advantage.

[10-Sep-19 12:28 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
but in long run it's not good for btc either. Drying up everything will kill btc too.

[10-Sep-19 12:35 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
today most coins are on green vs btc in binance, except zec of course.

[10-Sep-19 12:43 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Couldn't belief when I first saw zec was traded at 5000k dollars

[10-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418

Imagine the lifestyle what you get used to in couple years. It must be hard to change your ways again.

No money can fill the void you feel when you are insanely rich but still everything is shit

certain type of people just use all the money they get, no matter how much it is and never leave anything for rainy days.

[10-Sep-19 12:56 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
I don't have that problem. I've spent most of my btc in alts. Only cashed out enough in late 2017 so that I can get by for couple years. My time is soon up. 😅

[10-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Now when I look back, blow and prostitutes seem to have been better option than blow it all away in alts. 😉

I am selling all my stuff to buy $LINK. My credit card is maxed out. I don’t go out, I am trying to save as much as I can.

What if I am wrong? I have been wrong so many times before. I lose money and that’s okay.

But what if I am right?

link is one of the most overpriced coins you can find. And it's possible scam project too. Some people always want to invest in something what is expensive already.

my comment was not actually about the token, but his investment strategy

[10-Sep-19 01:28 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
Yeah, my problem is that I diversify too much. 😜 I've been catching falling knives for 1.5 years now, because I fomo in to everything atl and get burned even more. Just yesterday, I bought ada and dgb for that reason. At least ada seem to hold now, but need to monitor dgb closely and sell it, if it falls under 70 sats.

[10-Sep-19 01:30 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418

Yeah, I will monitor ada too. I don't let myself getting burned with it. I agree, it's kind of expensive still @450, but not compared to ath. I'll sell if it falls under 425.
