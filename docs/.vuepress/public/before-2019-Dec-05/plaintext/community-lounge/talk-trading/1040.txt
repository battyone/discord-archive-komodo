Genie has shown that the culture here accepts highly insulting people

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Markus#5464
i can buy any electronic with btc online and get it delivered to my door where is the issue?

[07-Aug-19 05:21 PM] p.#1126

[07-Aug-19 05:22 PM] Markus#5464

[07-Aug-19 05:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
CG is sometimes sarcastic but I don't think he insult people

[07-Aug-19 05:22 PM] p.#1126
NECC

[07-Aug-19 05:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
sure he does

[07-Aug-19 05:23 PM] Markus#5464
also remember seeing someone selling his 26 million dollar mansion in the USA for only bitcoin

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] p.#1126
not KMD??? whattt???

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] p.#1126
but the tech

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Tek#5253
yeah man, the people all have 26 million dollar mansions

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
that fool didnt know that KMD was far superior

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Tek#5253
bitcoin is truly the peoples coin!

[07-Aug-19 05:24 PM] Tek#5253
lmao @meatspoon

[07-Aug-19 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
if only CG was around to tell him he was a dumbass, then he would have sold it for KMD and ARRR

[07-Aug-19 05:26 PM] p.#1126
its like gathering the shit of 5 different animals and claiming that these turds are the best and you are simply diversified, that actual valuable thing next to the shit, no i dont want that

[07-Aug-19 05:26 PM] Daiyox#2701
KMD is the only crypto since 2017 I can go through and read the documentation and get all excited over again and again...It's truly incredible, yes the tech, but that's personally what I get pumped about..BTC I'm excited about as well in the exact opposite way, it's left alone, legacy tech, the "Master Ledger" and that is huge that it remain legacy / stable... What if KMD and BTC where somehow using each others strengths of stability / bleeding edge..and oh shit, they are 😃

[07-Aug-19 05:27 PM] p.#1126
kmd uses btc

[07-Aug-19 05:27 PM] p.#1126
does btc rely on kmd

[07-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Daiyox#2701
Sure it does

[07-Aug-19 05:27 PM] Tek#5253
forever BTC's bitch

[07-Aug-19 05:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
"bring out the KMD gimp!'

KMD is a BTC User, one of it's loyal customers, paying fees consistently

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
> supporting core

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
reminder its not the most secure anywmore

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
dash is

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] p.#1126
necc fest i see

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
and much cheaper

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
truly dash is now more secure than btc

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
they activated chain locks, anti 51% tech

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Whatever you have to tell yourself to sleep at night

[07-Aug-19 05:28 PM] Tek#5253
without being btc's bitch that is

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Markus#5464
and Dash is definitely decentralized with its creator having 50% of the circulating supply 🤔

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And all of its masternodes being money transmitters

{Reactions}
☝ 

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
no masternodes = no instant payments

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
no masternodes = no anti 51 tech

[07-Aug-19 05:29 PM] Tek#5253
bitcoin cash is building what dash already has

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
kmd boasts about > muh tech but what does it have to show for it

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
atleast with dash I know

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
but with KMD i don't

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
I just don't

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
I can't even shill kmd

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] meatspoon#7860
Dash seems to have hot chicks as well.... blockchain beaver.  yum

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] c2k#4915
hey Tek im curious, how much of your crypto portfolio is in KMD?

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
it used to be my biggest hold a few months ago

[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] Tek#5253
does that answer your question

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Daiyox#2701
What ? How can you not know with KMD? It is very well documented, not to mention you can sit around and launch your own chains to play as you wish, indulge in the tech

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Tek#5253
I don't have time to read documents

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Tek#5253
get your marketing team to deliiver it in easy formats

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] c2k#4915
but if the tech is so bad and the mktg so absent, why not dump it all?

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] c2k#4915
a few months ago you couldve sold near 20k

[07-Aug-19 05:32 PM] Markus#5464
But if Dash tech is so good, can it protect other blockchains aswell?

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
the rebrand and new website was an opportunity to explain how KMD could be used in real business...  they didnt do that

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Daiyox#2701
Is that the point here? Lack of marketing? If so then I can see why DASH would seem attractive atm

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Daiyox#2701
Long term

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Daiyox#2701
I see KMD as far more attractive

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] meatspoon#7860
the new website is just bedazzled with buzz words and empty tech jargon

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
@Markus yes, kmd could do dpow to dash

[07-Aug-19 05:33 PM] Tek#5253
but it will always be somones bitch

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Markus#5464
i mean Dash not KMD

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
Ideas by Nature really got balls deep in KMD and fucked it hard

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Markus#5464
KMD can protect other blockchains, can Dash do it aswell?

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ignoring the beta products that are out now

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] Tek#5253
that's a silly question, dash is building something different.

[07-Aug-19 05:34 PM] meatspoon#7860
who on earth wants to attack a KMD asset chain?

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
this goes back to the megalomania of KMD enthusiasts

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Markus#5464
so why compare kmd's security with dash? kmd's intention is not just for itself to be protected

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@meatspoon  non KMD chains use DPoW as well dumbass

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
im not comparing kmd with dash

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
i know

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
you can't compare

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] meatspoon#7860
but who wants to attack shitcoin chains?

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Caglio#3337
😃

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol ,  missed the entire year of double spend attacks on exchanges

[07-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Tek#5253
kmd securety.. hmm lets see

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
few months ago I almost lost 7 grand

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
cause of the kmd exploit

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] meatspoon#7860
and just to note, we have colored names using the term "dumbass".... so i think its safe to say we can all talk that way if we please.  i choose not to, but just sayin

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
what a secure and best tech projectt!

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
incorrect, a targeted end user client wallet attack. not kmd blockchain attack.

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Daiyox#2701
You mean the wallet bug ?

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
doesn't matter, it got in the build pipe line and I almost lost my funds

[07-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Tek#5253
it was a kmd wallet

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder don't bother. he doesn't understand tech

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] Tek#5253
you fucked up

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
Agama was the recommended wallet on the KMD site... the first one

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
it was essentially the official wallet

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Read the Eula

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We didn’t have to do anything

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
and shit, i am not even convinced there was an exploit.

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain I figured. he only talk dash. everything else probably is jus very much equals to "blah blah blah... shitcoin... blah blah...." 😄

[07-Aug-19 05:37 PM] meatspoon#7860
i left coins in my compromised wallet and they were not taken.  Left some in there to test

😂 (3) 💯 

[07-Aug-19 05:38 PM] SHossain#0007
that's Tek ^^

[07-Aug-19 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
and KMD surely made a killing scraping all sorts of derelict accounts

[07-Aug-19 05:38 PM] SHossain#0007
minus society

[07-Aug-19 05:38 PM] meatspoon#7860
how much KMD was netted in that event?
