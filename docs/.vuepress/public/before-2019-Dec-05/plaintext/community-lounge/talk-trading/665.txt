I would be super worried. Last I checked, HitBTC‚Äôs drained their exchange of all their bitcoins. 

Surprised they‚Äôve been solvent this long, truthfully. 

I‚Äôm sorry if you had funds stuck on there, that‚Äôs a shitty situation. https://t.co/UVzpYlAkT0

price approaching green line, though at a steep angle. if it blends into the greenline for a day, then it is back to the stairmaster pattern

we are seeing the ridiculous level of documentation that is being asked for. every transaction for last 5 years? even businesses that are in business and have to keep track of everything, would have a hard time and a lot of expenses to provide such detailed level of documentation. as whatever payment involved if it is utxo based, would have a different history based on which utxo in your wallet is used!

[20-May-19 05:15 PM] CHMEX#0686
KMD is at 200'226 unique receiving addresses in the last 365 Days

[20-May-19 05:16 PM] CHMEX#0686

[20-May-19 05:18 PM] Tek#5253
well yeah the kmd stats are skewed cause people collect interests

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
I make transactoins on KMD everytime to collect interest but they don't mean anything

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
native or lite wallet?

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] cipi#4502
that is one transaction per user per month

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
agama

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] Tek#5253
lite

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
only counts 1

[20-May-19 05:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
even if you collect every day

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
well i make more transactions on kmd because the binance withdraw fee is so low

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
so i withdraw everytime I buy 100 kmd

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] CHMEX#0686
always goes back to the same address

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
if there was lower withdraw for dash i'd use it more.

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
I have to use BCH for between exchangge

[20-May-19 05:20 PM] Tek#5253
or xrp or xlm if I need to be fast

[20-May-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
binance doesn't allow dash instant send yet else i'd use that

[20-May-19 05:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok... I just mentioned the numbers because the article talked about addresses... not transactions..

[20-May-19 05:21 PM] Tek#5253
oh

[20-May-19 05:22 PM] Tek#5253
active addresses for dash is probably skewed too cause they have change addresses

[20-May-19 05:22 PM] Tek#5253
anyways dash is mooning so im happy

[20-May-19 05:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
from their website `This enables a single Matic sidechain to theoretically achieve 2^16 transactions per block, and possibly millions of transactions on multiple chains in the future.` 
on 2018-05-16 14:59 ( a year ago ) we recorded about 1'307'631 transactions within 60 seconds on KMD assetchains

[20-May-19 05:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
hmmmmm `3. At the epoch, the public stakers will select a total of 5-7 block producer nodes`
