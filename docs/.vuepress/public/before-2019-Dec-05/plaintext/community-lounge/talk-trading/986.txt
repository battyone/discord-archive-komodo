You seem to be very relaxed. Its like you are coming from future and know what will happened

[31-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
what did google do from post bubble crash price

[31-Jul-19 04:07 PM] Alecandro#1179
oh yea I see now, sats then usd combined

[31-Jul-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i do tend to be able to project the future to some degree

KMD has been swimming upstream against a constant barrage of new top 50 "coins", what is this hypertrade and other stuff, no idea

[31-Jul-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want a sob story, look at STRAT

[31-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it went from being a solid top 20 coin in the billions and 10x KMD, now they are happy when they peak at 50% KMD marketcap

[31-Jul-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
they are victim of all the new projects and not swimming upstream, but treading water

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
so stop stressing out, we are actually doing fine considering the global state of things.

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yep, I agree. The "boring" projects will be the ones that reap the long term rewards and actually survive

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
just think about it lol

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
real tech and products vs. air and marketing

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
in the next year or two there will be a LOT of new regulations and scrutiny to the top coins. do we really want to be in the spotlight right now?

[31-Jul-19 04:10 PM] Alecandro#1179
marketing only lasts so long

[31-Jul-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
its not that we do anything wrong, just that if regulators get in their mind they need to make an example of some project and tear it apart, they can probably make life difficult for a targeted victim

[31-Jul-19 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
by lurking where we are, can be a bit higher, but i wouldnt want to be in the top 10 to top 20 now

[31-Jul-19 04:11 PM] Alecandro#1179
@jl777c what did you think about the SEC saying theyre gonna run nodes

[31-Jul-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i think they have been for a long time

[31-Jul-19 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
deanonymizing ip address by linking it to transactions

[31-Jul-19 04:12 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea that would honestly make sense

[31-Jul-19 04:14 PM] coingirl87#6489
@jl777c  your words like balm for the soul...i am very excited if you are a good oracle :-)

[31-Jul-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
a month ago, i read the flyclient paper or try to, but a much simpler nSPV appears in my mind and a month later i am near to testing an html wallet that is almost as secure as a fullnode and as fast to get started on as an electrum client. basically the best of both worlds

[31-Jul-19 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the other day, i heard MORTY was diff stranded due to someone boosting diff 50000x and by the next day i have a new -ac_adaptivepow option that solves the problem of diff stranding for all low hashrate chains. and in the world of millions of blockchains, most all of them will be low hashrate. there is no need to use PoS just to be able to be sure to keep a chain moving. from a technical point despite some issues with PoW, a 100% PoW chain is really the best

[31-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
over last 6 years i have learned a lot and now we have a team that is leveraging my experience

[31-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the latest libnspv improvements was done by blackjok3r, who came up to speed in a matter of days

[31-Jul-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so i am feeling actually quite positive about the state of things. the marketing has improved quite a lot from the brown sheet days, this cannot be denied

[31-Jul-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
we dont do silly partnerships anymore

[31-Jul-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
so now it is just a matter of time

[31-Jul-19 04:21 PM] coingirl87#6489
Amen

What are the use case scenarios for kmd side chains? Will they increase a demand for komodo similar to eth gas?

Wise word from jl

[31-Jul-19 04:28 PM] Pumtchak#0362
Think about AtomicDEX, this is becoming a reality and it wont be unoticed by the cryptosphere forever

[31-Jul-19 04:29 PM] Pumtchak#0362
still, before any top20 there is marketing and community to build

[31-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Pumtchak#0362
just be patient

[31-Jul-19 04:30 PM] Pumtchak#0362

Stratis is good example ,  KMD  still  near top50  ,   but  all  Strat , PIVX  etc  blown away  from top100  by  new  POS  coins  from  nowere

year ago  top100

[31-Jul-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@joe2x4 you are still thinking with the old paradigm

[31-Jul-19 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
however, the antara pegs module will create demand for KMD as people would deposit their KMD to issue stablecoins

[31-Jul-19 04:54 PM] joe2x4#5987
I guess I will have to wait and see as I'm not exactly understanding the why and what of sidechains. Was hoping that maybe they provided an exclusive incentive for kmd usecase

i can make a KMD usage tax

[31-Jul-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
like google charging for each search at the beginning

[31-Jul-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt that have been great for their early cashflow?

[31-Jul-19 05:06 PM] joe2x4#5987
I see your point. I can't say for certain that Google did this, but Facebook and Eth both exploded because of GoldmanSachs investment not necessarily because of adoption.

[31-Jul-19 05:07 PM] allbits#5898
KMD doesn't design things to satisfy linear thinking VC type demands. It seeks to generate actual use by being useful for users.

[31-Jul-19 05:09 PM] allbits#5898
If you want a VC style coin that seeks above all to force people to pay kmd fees in order to use, there are lots of other cons, usually vc backed, that can satisfy you there

You can now chart "seconds" time frame on Trading View. 

Degen trading just reached a new level.

Best of luck to all those traders, trying to get away from their screens for a few seconds

@Hollowman9000 I see you are considering coming over to the dark side, mining üòÉ

[31-Jul-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
Those miners are always making money, no need to stare at 1s charts all day. Only need to look at charts when you want to sell

[31-Jul-19 05:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Are you using the CIA microwave gun on me again üò°

[31-Jul-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
Being a good trader is really valuable as a miner

[31-Jul-19 05:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
Most miners are really bad at reading an order book

[31-Jul-19 05:27 PM] LocoMB#8593
need to follow the cheap kWh for mining - Georgia (the country in the Caucasus, not the state in US) is really good for that

[31-Jul-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
They will depress price on one exchange for convenience, all kinds of things that pro traders probably wouldn't do

[31-Jul-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
@LocoMB where you live and were you mine are 2 different things

[31-Jul-19 05:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
some people think they must have cheap power where they live

[31-Jul-19 05:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
sure- but if you scale, you better visit occasionally, maybe every cpl months or so

Are you deploying a botnet in some shithole or pricing different VPS services?

[31-Jul-19 05:29 PM] LocoMB#8593
frined of mine has a mining rig in insanely epxensive germany- 13 graphics crads, not really profitable

[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
CPU mining is not sensitive to price of electricity. 20 cent/kwh or even more is viable, firstly

[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
ASIC/FGPA mining is very electricity price sensitive

[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPU mining is somewhere between asic/fpga and CPU

[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] LocoMB#8593
so need to pick a nice CPU coin?!?!

[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] tolken#2655
@Hollowman9000 you truly sound like the dude from mad max now.  ‚ÄúWalk away, live another day, no harm will come to you! Just walk away!‚Äù

There are many many many CPU coins, they are all crazy speculative. Perfect for degen traders

Of course

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
BLUR is adding DPoW. First monero fork to do so

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am helping them

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Nice

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You tell them better tech is already available :abusedsmily:

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
You can only mine it on your computer. There is no asics, no GPUs, no FPGAs and no pools. Solo mining only. It's kind of nice.

[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
?

[31-Jul-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Hollowman9000 it's proof that DPoW can protect a  non-Bitcoin-derived codebase, so it's pretty awesome for KMD when they finally launch it

[31-Jul-19 05:33 PM] LocoMB#8593
or on a DigO droplet?!?!

[31-Jul-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can. You will pay more to DO then you mine

[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
But that is if you sell right now. It's on a few exchanges. Best is to mine on your own hardware

[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
