$KMD #KOMODO

Significant rally upwards. Hard rejection around 22K sats. 

Currently resting around the earlier resistance for support + 0.618 fibonacci level.

$USD pair facing downtrend line quite soon.
Holding above $0,60 is a good sign and target $1,50-1,60 + 32K sats.

looking to rebuy at any level as  I think this range is great, I'm cautiously optimistic we don't break 50cents

the thing about btc movements these days (I speculate) is they are pretty much entirely dependent on stopping out the masses

Since btc is a polyfacetic asset, it might just follow whatever surges during a stock collapse

well, that might become a trend and all the community messaging will turn into BTC is similar to gold but BETTER!

[17-Jan-19 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and some money from gold will move into btc

[17-Jan-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It went the other way last year so that makes sense
