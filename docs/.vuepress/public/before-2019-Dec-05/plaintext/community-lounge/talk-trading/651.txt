withdrawals would be launched "shortly after" trading resumed

[15-May-19 02:49 PM] Malti#3948
Withdrawals will be enabled soon.  Some final tests, just making sure this upgrade is fully operational.

Zcash forced the recipients of their own Founders Reward to get 25% less (or else what?) so that the company could stay solvent. With a burn rate of $880K/month, it's no wonder that "The company is currently operating at a deficit" $ZEC transparency report

BCH came under attack today, due to an old bug in block template creation. Attack led to empty blocks for a short while, until patched, otherwise had little effect.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 not a hardfork, this is inside of the 20% FR, they messed with how it's allocated

[15-May-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
took away 25% from Zcash Founders

[15-May-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
lol

[15-May-19 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ahhh, so they are still raping miners, just allocating the plunder differently ☑

[15-May-19 04:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
the are now abusing their own who built the castle walls

[15-May-19 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
ECC's real biz plan might be to just close up shop and go bankrupt when the FR ends

[15-May-19 04:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
oops, we went bankrupt after 4 years of FR!!!

[15-May-19 04:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
Spending almost 1M USD per month..... lolwut

or rather we'll soon see another 'fee market' success, depending on point of view :troll_hardcore:

if you read the ZEC/BTC chart, you should sell your fillings and go all into ZEC

Yeah fuck that

[15-May-19 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
these daytraders must know something I don't

[15-May-19 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I’ll wait patiently for my shitcoins to get pumped for no reason and consolidate them into KMD and pirate

[15-May-19 04:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
one theory, is that with binance down, miners couldn't sell, so they ignored binance for a while and saw that helped price. They are waiting to dump on these poor hopium bong smokers

[15-May-19 04:23 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Maybe more tezzies because fanbois gonna fanboi

[15-May-19 04:25 PM] klein#5233
@dukeleto  hot tip don't try and rationalise these price movements

[15-May-19 04:26 PM] klein#5233
the project can have lots of holes in it as you have discovered and talked about

[15-May-19 04:27 PM] klein#5233
there is still lots of dumb money funneled into it from the likes of shillbert

[15-May-19 04:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein that is good advice. I used to be a ZEC miner, so this used to be my job

[15-May-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein i am more interested in how the asic hw cycle and miners effect price. I know that traders operate on very different data and mindset

[15-May-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@klein and as a coin dev on various other ZEC "competitors", you could say, I am interested to study ZEC, no matter what

[15-May-19 04:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
I don't do daytrading, so I am not trying turn a quick buck on this data

[15-May-19 04:31 PM] klein#5233
yeah thats cool

[15-May-19 04:31 PM] klein#5233
I get ya

[15-May-19 04:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
much more interested in the long term

[15-May-19 04:32 PM] doggo#1574
wouldn't miners just sell OTC? no risk of slippage
