Long as in margin trading

[15-Aug-18 02:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If you go long, you buy at 2x 5x 10x or even 100x the trading deposit you do

[15-Aug-18 02:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is what i call long

[15-Aug-18 09:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
I guess anybody could generate such an address with vanitygen.

[15-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Andersen#8337
Sure.  But why ?

[15-Aug-18 09:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
making people talk about it

[15-Aug-18 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the games played by whales is quite sophisticated. every % point they can drop BTC price is another % point of profit

[15-Aug-18 09:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
and influencing the price to their advantage

[15-Aug-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind OTC BTC trading is 3x the size of the exchange traded, so the "loss" on the exchange side can 3x profits on the OTC side

[15-Aug-18 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
All 3BMEX addresses are bitmex adresses

[15-Aug-18 09:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Bitmex isnt directly trading btc though

[15-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So if one would marketbuy 100M worth on mex

[15-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
that wouldnt effect the true btc price would it?

[15-Aug-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but at bitmex you can use BTC for long or short trades

[15-Aug-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
its just a small whale setting up some short position so they can dump on the exchanges, buy at discount and recover multiples of their public losses. standard stuff and easy millions tomake

I made an app that lets you chart anything on coinmarketcap on tradingview. It also integrates with coinmarketcal events.

Go to https://t.co/4ln8wx417M and just search for whatever shitcoin you want

How long will it take for people to realize btc will continue to chop without a big external catalyst and move on over to alts?

[16-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Had a quick look at the ‚Äò14-‚Äò16 period

[16-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems total marketcap and btc price moved the same way, which gives an indication that even then alts were coupled to btc

[16-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Total mcap is BTC + Alts

[16-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And we see that historically BTC always does the same thing the total mcap does, which implies that alts also move the same way btc does
