[27-Oct-19 06:57 PM] Markus#5464
tbh im not interested atm in btc, i just want alts to start doing something finally

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Lanii#8302
I dont understand why you wouldnt be interested

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Lanii#8302
if you do TA

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Lanii#8302
imo allocate 50% of ur capital

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Lanii#8302
and trade btc

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Markus#5464
i was planning to do that but things kinda changed üòÑ

[27-Oct-19 06:58 PM] Lanii#8302
how come O;

[27-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Lanii#8302
personal issues or you are not liking btc price action atm?

[27-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Lanii#8302
Cuz no doubt sometimes you are simply not in sync with the markets

[27-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Lanii#8302
been there done that

[27-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Markus#5464
kmd been looking juicy lately but every "dip" buying always resulted in getting underwater even after going sideways for weeks

[27-Oct-19 06:59 PM] Markus#5464
i quess i can just blame myself üòÑ

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
well mate

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
if you are buying dips

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
usually you are presented with a good SL

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
but from experience kmd is hard to trade because its the only alt I held for years

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
cuz of FA

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
And trading with emotions is just meh

[27-Oct-19 07:00 PM] Lanii#8302
I bet you wouldn't take such downsides on other alts, you'd just cut them off

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Lanii#8302
thats why TA > FA

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
Yea so now im kinda underwater and waiting for a better recovery to get out and be smarter

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
but it was good learning üòÑ

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Lanii#8302
yeh

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Lanii#8302
what helped me was to simply cut a big chunk of and margin trade it on binance

[27-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Lanii#8302
since most other alts also rekt

[27-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Lanii#8302
and with them I have no mercy on stops üôÇ

[27-Oct-19 07:07 PM] Markus#5464
ye xD

[27-Oct-19 07:28 PM] Neko#5830
komodo will never be this cheap again

[27-Oct-19 07:30 PM] coingirl87#6489
Lol...reasons for that?

[27-Oct-19 07:30 PM] Neko#5830
atomicdex

[27-Oct-19 07:32 PM] coingirl87#6489
Atomic dex is already available for everyone

[27-Oct-19 07:32 PM] Neko#5830
public beta and basically no market or altcoin liquidity

I was explaining how whales manipulate altcoins earlier...

For those not familiar with whale manipulation this, is a good guide on what to look out for.

There are typically 6 stages:
1. Suppression
2. Range Bound
3. Test Pump
4. Sell Off
5. Price Pump
6. Exit

Thats the point...no liquidity

[27-Oct-19 07:33 PM] coingirl87#6489
Why should there liquidity in futre?

[27-Oct-19 07:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Why are people expecting liquidity during the testing phase

[27-Oct-19 07:34 PM] coingirl87#6489
I know atomic dex has best tech but we all know...tech is not all

[27-Oct-19 07:35 PM] coingirl87#6489
@polycryptoblog what is the plan to get liquidity in atomic dex?

[27-Oct-19 07:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Several plans targeting  different groups of people.   Miners, exchanges , average joe users

[27-Oct-19 07:37 PM] Neko#5830
I plan to never use a CEX again unless to go back to fiat

Same

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why would I

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
There will be market maker bots

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Allowing your funds to work for you

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Turnkey DEX for the exchanges.  Aggregating and coin switching for miners.  A public campaign for the average joe users.  That‚Äôs the  ELI5 of it.

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Etc

[27-Oct-19 07:38 PM] coingirl87#6489
Dont understand me wrong...i believe in komodo and devs but komodos biggest problem over last days, weeks and month was, that there is absolutly no demand...volume is  low...jl777 confirm that only bots are trading and dump the coins....so why you think it would be changed?

[27-Oct-19 07:40 PM] coingirl87#6489
Also whales who pump kmd back are no longer here

[27-Oct-19 07:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Demand for Komodo was talked about in the long cc-peg discussion the other day.

[27-Oct-19 07:41 PM] coingirl87#6489
We need a constantly demand but i cant   see any signs for it...sorry

Then do something about it if it is something you care enough about.

[27-Oct-19 07:42 PM] coingirl87#6489
I cant do anything...i have invest all into kmd

[27-Oct-19 07:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you think there is a party that would be interested in providing liquidity then reach out to them or send us their contact info.   But just saying no liquidity over and over again does nothing to fix the problem

[27-Oct-19 07:45 PM] coingirl87#6489
Kmd should do something to get  attention

ü§¶ (2) 

[27-Oct-19 07:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
If you think the devs are doing good work and there is or will be demand for their product then demand for KMD will follow

[27-Oct-19 07:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
In crypto, high volume does not correlate with high quality project

[27-Oct-19 07:45 PM] Neko#5830
If I were a whale I would pump the shit out of KMD, thats the best marketing there is

[27-Oct-19 07:45 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Over time this will be the case so we will see about the fate of kmd

[27-Oct-19 07:48 PM] Markus#5464
I think the best would be to have a person who can represent KMD tech and knows every single part of it who can debate with ppl like vitalik in public blockchain events, this would bring alot of interest from ppl in many different ways

[27-Oct-19 07:49 PM] Neko#5830
or the NEO guy

[27-Oct-19 07:50 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well, at this moment the "big cap" coins are just busy to keep them big as long as possible. For every good KMD video, a coin like EOS has 1000 trolls/believers/hodlers to flood Twitter etc. with their crap

[27-Oct-19 07:51 PM] coingirl87#6489
I temember that some month ago kmd say that they will work togeher with a very big company...is this still correct?

[27-Oct-19 07:51 PM] CoinKing88#1540
We need a major breakthrough event to get things going for KMD, something like Ameritrade to incorperate Atomicdex for transactions or something

[27-Oct-19 07:52 PM] cascrypto#8206
my bet is on #chips @coingirl87

[27-Oct-19 07:52 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Just something crypto and others cant ignore, the marketingfunds that EOS/ONT/NEO etc have are just too big to counter with some JL777 medium posts (which actually are very high quality)

[27-Oct-19 07:52 PM] coingirl87#6489
@@cascrypto Yes but who is the big company behind that?

[27-Oct-19 07:55 PM] umitkara48#6464
Every coin 2x but kmd not why

[27-Oct-19 07:55 PM] cascrypto#8206
decentralized greed and fun, but would be nice to have a brand using the tech

[27-Oct-19 07:56 PM] umitkara48#6464
Any bad news or somting that

[27-Oct-19 07:56 PM] Lanii#8302
No bad news, more like no news at all

[27-Oct-19 07:56 PM] Lanii#8302
most people prob have no clue kmd exists and what it does

[27-Oct-19 07:57 PM] umitkara48#6464
I dont know

[27-Oct-19 07:57 PM] umitkara48#6464
I lost money lots of money

[27-Oct-19 07:58 PM] cascrypto#8206
we all did, learn from it

[27-Oct-19 07:59 PM] Neko#5830
@CoinKing88 I believe this will eventually happen, because kmd is leading the market in this sector, one of these days a big company will incorporate atomicdex into their services
