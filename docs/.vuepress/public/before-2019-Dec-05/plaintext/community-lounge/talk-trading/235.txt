since it isnt cold

[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, of course. the zksnarks zaddr is no visible anywhere on the blockchain

[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so it is quantum proof ?

[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] snowdamn#2414
no 5% on z

[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
well, that I am not sure about as it does use encryption and maybe it is possible to QC attack it

[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
also QC attack methods are constantly improving

[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
any estimations when true QC will be able to attack blockchain ?

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
gov secret agencies can already have one efficient ?

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
likely already possible

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
hmm if possible there should be some serious papers about it

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
there are

believing all comes from official science first

[21-Oct-18 12:38 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok then cold storage actually already make sense

[21-Oct-18 12:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and being QC proof

[21-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
QC resistant

[21-Oct-18 12:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
yes QC resistant

[21-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
danger to say "QC proof" without a mathematical proof of impossibility

[21-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and proving negatives is usually quite difficult

[21-Oct-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
just buy a dozen and test them out :trollface:

[21-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
they will be the ulitmate mining gear

[21-Oct-18 12:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
so changing 5% claim to monthly was an additional troll towards those that claim to same address üòÇ

[21-Oct-18 12:41 PM] snowdamn#2414
reminds them how stupid they are every month

[21-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
I am not so worried about QC for individual amounts

[21-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
there are so many 10,000+ BTC addresses to go after

[21-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
when we see them mysteriously being cracked, then it is time to be more urgent about it

FYI, in my most humble opinion, RVN is still susceptible to 51% attacks even with their new "protection" so be safe out there traders: https://twitter.com/dukeleto/status/1054009374836875266

Some cryptocoins are implementing questionable-at-best ways to protect against 51% attacks, such as $RVN: https://t.co/ndusoE2AEk

wasnt ravencoin interested in dPOW?

[21-Oct-18 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but they decided it was too expensive, so they rolled their own "protection"

[21-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
You would think the lively hood of your entire ecosystem is worth the price of the komodo for the protection. Especially considering komodo has already proven to work. You can tell where their value lay.

Peanuts.

[21-Oct-18 02:49 PM] bishop#9773
Well, till the rewards stop

[21-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it would only be for 30 years

[21-Oct-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but price is increasing, so by delaying it will end up costing them a lot more

[21-Oct-18 02:51 PM] bishop#9773
@jl777c Is max supply now going to be less than 200M KMD?

[21-Oct-18 02:51 PM] bishop#9773
from failure to claim, etc, etc

[21-Oct-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
likely will be significantly less at 7777777, but there is now a decreasing blockreward to make up the balance

[21-Oct-18 02:52 PM] bishop#9773
so over a long enough time horizon, it will ultimately cap at 200?

[21-Oct-18 02:53 PM] bishop#9773
absent ever-changing crypto, world destruction, etc

[21-Oct-18 02:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if this isnt changed before 2057, it might go over 200 million and by the year 3540 there would be almost a billion

[21-Oct-18 02:56 PM] bishop#9773
lol

[21-Oct-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
In the overall scope of things an inflation rate of 0.25% that is reducing annually will be of any meaningful impact

[21-Oct-18 02:58 PM] bishop#9773
I think I would be most interested to see what cryptography looks like 40 years into the future

[21-Oct-18 02:58 PM] bishop#9773
and the amount of computing power a consumer could own

[21-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
likely QC for the encryption side is pervasive, significantly sooner than 40 years

[21-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
using QC can make QC proof encryption

[21-Oct-18 02:59 PM] bishop#9773
Maybe the next extension beyond quantum

[21-Oct-18 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
probably 10 years to make that transition, so maybe 40 years is not so far out

[21-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
we still have microwave ovens that work basically the same

[21-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
displays have evolved, yes, but very similar (just much more resolution, colors, realism)

[21-Oct-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there are not so many crypto math advances that happen so quickly

[21-Oct-18 03:01 PM] bishop#9773
and QC will change that I'm sure. Then it comes down to what is beyond at that, if anything.

"She's a nice lady"

[21-Oct-18 03:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
I have a regulatory compliance question:  my understanding is that if coins/tokens are traded on an exchange (be it CEX or DEX) that could be considered securities, the SEC could possibly go after anyone who maintains that exchange or any gateways leading to the exchange.  Is there anyone on the KMD or BarterDex team that monitors coins traded on those exchanges?  Does KMD have legal council that is soliciting legal opinions from the coins that are traded on BarterDex?

[21-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@meatspoon in countries where they have taken away your right to sell what you own, then maybe it is illegal

[21-Oct-18 03:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
yeah, the US is one of those

[21-Oct-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you swap some coins with someone in EU, it is illegal as far as the US is concerned?

[21-Oct-18 03:15 PM] meatspoon#7860
if the coin/token can be considered a security, then the SEC can start sending their nasty letters around

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
to the blockchain?

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
for doing an atomic swap?

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
if any infrastructure, nodes, gateways, etc are located in the US they can put pressure on those

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the swap is done between the two participant nodes

[21-Oct-18 03:16 PM] meatspoon#7860
they could even in theory try to apply pressure on the KMD project if they viewed the project as facilitating illicit security sales

[21-Oct-18 03:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
agreed

[21-Oct-18 03:17 PM] meatspoon#7860
the question remains, tho, does KMD have legal council looking into these issues?

[21-Oct-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no law covering atomic swaps

WTB 1000 jumbler offer 3000 KMD

[21-Oct-18 03:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
agreed, bishop.  and it would likely be difficult for them to exert power.  but rest assured, they will attempt to exert power over those teams and people who violate their silly little regs

[21-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
there is KMD the open source project

[21-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
there is KMD marketing team

[21-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
these are separate

[21-Oct-18 03:19 PM] meatspoon#7860
i have been researching DEX's a lot recently and different teams are taking the approaches differently, but one commonality is that they vet coins by getting legal opinions from the teams behind the coins.  to help push responsibility on the coin, not the dex

[21-Oct-18 03:19 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
@meatspoon fromd what i understand there is no mainserver for barterdex, it's like torrent, 2 peer 2 peer connections, they trade with each other vioa the same client, there is no attack vector on barterdex itself

[21-Oct-18 03:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
thanks, pbk.  I just have a lot of distrust for government in general and all of the control freaks in it.  I think that projects who have legal council already engaged in trying to either keep things compliant or avoid compliance issues will be the projects that are less likely to get bent over a barrel by the gov

[21-Oct-18 03:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
barterdex is running the risk of attracting negative attention from the government bean counters if it facilitates the transfer of securities without compliance

[21-Oct-18 03:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
and if barterdex kinda runs on KMD, well...

[21-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX is independent from KMD technically

[21-Oct-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
in almost all ways

[21-Oct-18 03:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, thats goodish

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
0conf deposits are the only KMD specific thing

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
they only care about taxes for individuals and corporations alike
they won't waste more than necessary resources on the DEX level 
they'll just  go after taxes at the conversion to fiat and/or purchases

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
oh, they will target DEX's at some point

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
with DEX volumes so small, it seems an unlikely target

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
well, all the KYC stuff is going to increase and push people towards dexs

[21-Oct-18 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but we do have legal counsels for legal stuff that comes up

[21-Oct-18 03:25 PM] snowdamn#2414
no benefit to go after the trading on DEX

[21-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
bartering is thousands of years old

[21-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
taking away peoples right to barter

[21-Oct-18 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that is a bold move

any admin up for a 2.5k kmd deal? to be a escorw for it

[21-Oct-18 03:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
@snowdamn I disagree, if they could (in theory) shut down DEX's, everything would have to go thru the KYC gateways.  Dex's mean the possibility to avoid taxes

[21-Oct-18 03:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
they wont frame it up that way, jl.  they will make it a tax issue, talk about people getting rich trading in dark, shady DEX's

[21-Oct-18 03:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
talk about people "not paying their fair share"

[21-Oct-18 03:29 PM] meatspoon#7860
its also worth pointing out that the SEC and other government agencies are also used to create near-monopolies by smothering competition of bigger corporations.  No reason to think this won't happen in crypto as larger projects start to put lobbyists in washington

[21-Oct-18 03:30 PM] snowdamn#2414
@meatspoon i'll give an example because you might have missed what i meant:
let's say i have X coin
i trade for Y coin on DEX
i understand that for some countries there is a tax event 
but why would they waste resources on the DEX level when they can trace Y when converted to fiat or purchases?
if you sell me your house for Y, they got me üòâ
