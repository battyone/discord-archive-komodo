Haaaa i had the same saw a focu about a guy mining bitcoin i think in 2012.. Or earlier stupid as i was i toght why is this guy wasting all his time printing fake money    😱

[26-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Tek#5253
@jl777c what wallet do you use to store bitcoin core? I didn't think i'd ever consider this

[26-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Tek#5253
but maybe I need to store away some BTC too

[26-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Tek#5253
already have most of my alts on own addresses

[26-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Tek#5253
but I don't like to move my btc cause fees

[26-Jun-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
cli wallet, pre-segwit

[26-Jun-19 11:06 AM] Tek#5253
i just want to be sure my shit is safe, and obviously it isn't on any exchange

[26-Jun-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if to compare to last bull market, when the bear market low was a bit below $200. we are now a bit more than 4x the bear market low of this cycle, so that puts it about when BTC was $800 in the last cycle

[26-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Tek#5253
already not looking forward to making the transactions 😦

[26-Jun-19 11:09 AM] JvdP#8992
Get a Ledger, they're <0.01 BTC and your KMD can go on there as well... 😃

[26-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Tek#5253
i dont like hardware wallets

[26-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Tek#5253
its for noobs. if the cops / enemies find you r hardware wallet you are screwed

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
i might use the hardware wallet in my phone but i will never store most of my value in a hardware wallet

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
What do you mean? They will need your pin

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
if they find a hardware wallet on you they KNOW you have crypto.

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] JvdP#8992
Well I experimented with a cold storage system based on an amnesic OS on a flash drive but it was a huge pain in the ass to run. Also, I had to have redundant flash drives in case one would go bust.

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But that is if they find it

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Tek#5253
they can take it from you

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont have it on you

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Remember the 24 words

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
taddr will be fully deanonymized

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] JvdP#8992
Ledger has an option to have two PINs

[26-Jun-19 11:11 AM] JvdP#8992
Plausible deniability

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@JvdP oh really?

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
how do you activate that?

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] JvdP#8992
If you're extorted, give them the low-value PIN

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] JvdP#8992
let me check real quick

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
now they will ask for both PIN

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I know trezor has a password

[26-Jun-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But didnt know about ledger

[26-Jun-19 11:13 AM] JvdP#8992
You don't _have_ to set the duress pin

[26-Jun-19 11:13 AM] JvdP#8992
I bet most people will only use the one

[26-Jun-19 11:13 AM] JvdP#8992
So if you give them one, there's no way for them to know there's another one.

[26-Jun-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I did not know there was 2 😄

[26-Jun-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
will cost you a finger or two to convince them you didnt set the second pin

[26-Jun-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just remember the 24 word seed then 😄

[26-Jun-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont worry about the ledger

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But the thing that has not been solved, if you die and you have all your coins in a place only you know, the user friendly ledger would be much easier for your loved ones to get access to it

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
i also hate the vendor lock in of hardware wallets

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] Tek#5253
or is that not a thing?

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the safest would be to put the coins where nobody knows where it is, even you

  Security ti...

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It isnt, 24 words can be moved between ledger/trezor

[26-Jun-19 11:15 AM] JvdP#8992
Found it

[26-Jun-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c  i have done that, now i dont even have access any more, lost the private key haha

[26-Jun-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is quite effective method

[26-Jun-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
for real lol...not even a joke and not a small amount either

[26-Jun-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
working on a way to ensure it is possible (though not easy) to find most of the coins

[26-Jun-19 11:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Let me know how you go with that, luke was going to work on a crypto will/crypto vault

[26-Jun-19 11:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But dont think he has had time to work on it

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is my biggest issue, if i get hit by a bus tomorrow, the steps taken to protect the coins will be lost and that would suck

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] Tek#5253
well time to sleep with the machete near me again

[26-Jun-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont die in your sleep.....:P

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253
lots of people know I have cones, good people

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253
but still

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
people talk

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253
it was part of the avertisement plan to make crypto moon harder

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253
but now a lot of people know I have cones

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Tek#5253
which is not good

[26-Jun-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
time to attend the hollowman boating school

[26-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Tek#5253
lmao 😄

[26-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Tek#5253
anyone know where i can buy cyanide pills?

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Tek#5253
just in case if i ever get into a situation where they try to torture me

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Tek#5253
I can just kill myself

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol.....why not just give it to them at that point....

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Tek#5253
id rather die. I am not scared of death

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Tek#5253
its just a phase

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Tek#5253
i dont want it to be painful

[26-Jun-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is just silly, that is a lose lose...

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you give them the funds you wont need to die right? lol

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] Tek#5253
I don't see death as the end.

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you only give them a portion even better

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So you will rise after 3 days and find your private keys?

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] Tek#5253
no

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Tek#5253
my soul will never die

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] Tek#5253
it just moves to a new body

[26-Jun-19 11:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will you remember your old body?

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Tek#5253
Theres people that have past life rememberance. I don't but I do think thats something that is possible

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But this is where your argument falls over, if you cant remember then you lost your funds

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So why die if you have a chance of giving up the funds and living? 😛

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] jansako#3330
try to remember the passphrase from past life... that's new

[26-Jun-19 11:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
lol ya

[26-Jun-19 11:25 AM] Tek#5253
in a post crypto apocalipse world, you don't want to be alive if you don't have crypto

[26-Jun-19 11:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
People can make more money, people cant live more lives

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jansako#3330
well, he says they ca is the thing

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
you make your own reality.

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] jansako#3330
not sure him mom would agree...

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
the word "impossible" does not exist in my dictionary

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Tek#5253
can't neither

[26-Jun-19 11:27 AM] Tek#5253

[26-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I can live with that

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
