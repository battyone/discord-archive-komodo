[01-May-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you can tip me 1% of gains as a tip

[01-May-19 11:59 AM] Markus#5464
imagine it actually working out haha

[01-May-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
when real money is at stake, things become a lot less of a sure thing

[01-May-19 12:00 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Itâ€™s going to go sideways for eternity believe me on that ðŸ˜Ž

[01-May-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c why financial advice :troll_lol:

[01-May-19 12:01 PM] Buddz1993#5380
If @jl777c  says so it must be true right ?

[01-May-19 12:01 PM] Alexfrog#1338
jl777c doesnt give trading advice, he only gives troll advice ðŸ˜„

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Alexfrog#1338
advises you to believe in the thing you just said would happen, at 100x leverage ðŸ˜„

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
all this TA "analysis" that is 100% sure of things, is making me laugh

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Markus#5464
were part of the troll @Alexfrog

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Ahah

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
TA works unless it doesnt

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Markus#5464
ofc nothing is sure hehe

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Trading is life

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
and the only way to know which is AFTER the fact

[01-May-19 12:02 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Life isnâ€™t trading

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are painting the charts with massive volumes

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Alexfrog#1338
TA isnt about being sure of things, its about one outcome being more likely than the other due to the pattern, but its still a probability

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
tfw never used T.A in my life

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Tek#5253
and never will

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
no worries, when we get close to 50 weekly ma there will be another Tether fud :troll_king:

[01-May-19 12:03 PM] Buddz1993#5380
You know when TA becomes realistic ?, when everything is going up crazy and you draw some lines that worked out because everything is going up lol

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alexfrog of course, since the big players are manipulating the price to make it fit the TA patterns

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] Buddz1993#5380
And you get called a genius because you predicted that

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
to trick people into thinking it works better than it should be

[01-May-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
when they gather all the newbs on the wrong side using the "sure thing TA", that is when the disbelief starts

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
You guys remember this guy https://steemit.com/@haejin

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Saying verge would go to 8 dollars loool

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Tek#5253
there has been simulations of pattern recognition and such on millions of charts

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Because TA

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Tek#5253
the conclusion is it doesn't work

[01-May-19 12:05 PM] Alexfrog#1338
If you use TA that tells you to buy when a thing goes up, or to sell when it goes down, youre doing it wrong.  thats the stuff they teach to the public to get you to give them their profit.    I prefer stuff like fib retracement levels that tells you when to buy after a drop or sell a rise.

[01-May-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the over reaction of price movement is one of the most reliable things, human nature and all that

[01-May-19 12:06 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Tek, thats like saying "poker strategy doesnt work, on average, players lose money to the rake"

[01-May-19 12:06 PM] Markus#5464
Dont u remember ppl saying XRP going to 10$

[01-May-19 12:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
trillions market caps

[01-May-19 12:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
every poker player is following a strategy, and on average they lose, therefore no poker strategy works?

[01-May-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alexfrog in trading you are competing against everyone and piggy backing on the most financed players is the best bet

[01-May-19 12:07 PM] Alexfrog#1338
there is TA that works, but the people who created it and understand it sure as hell arent going to just tell it to the public ðŸ˜„

[01-May-19 12:08 PM] Tek#5253
@Alexfrog its been scientifically proven T.A doesn't work better than flipping a coin

[01-May-19 12:08 PM] Buddz1993#5380
This turned out to be quite the conversation ðŸ˜‚

[01-May-19 12:09 PM] Tek#5253
they did pattern recognition of those T.A patterns like head and shoulders and what not. on a few million charts, conclusion = flipping a coin works just as wel

[01-May-19 12:09 PM] Markus#5464
patterns do not always play out either

[01-May-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
there was a H&S pattern in bitcoin a while after the big green pole

[01-May-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
but no drop came

[01-May-19 12:10 PM] Markus#5464
probably alot of ppl had a short position setup at that point

[01-May-19 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
tfw bch dropped to 0.049

[01-May-19 12:16 PM] Tek#5253
damn shoulda just waited

[01-May-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
in markets where there are no dominant participants, you can create predictive algo with much better than 50% accuracy

[01-May-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
I made an 85% correct predictor for 2 hours ahead forex prices, but it was just an up/down and this is almost enough to overcome the built in factors of spread, slippage, etc

[01-May-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
tfw got some sats out of BCH

[01-May-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
take that jihan

[01-May-19 12:19 PM] Tek#5253
take that ver

[01-May-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it required a data set of 8years, less than that and there wasnt enough info for the predictor to categorize enough possible patterns

[01-May-19 12:20 PM] Tek#5253
wew

[01-May-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
based on this, i think the crypto market is having too many whales to be statistically predictable and not enough history

[01-May-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but having the standard TA patterns as part of the millions of features did improve the predictor

[01-May-19 12:20 PM] Tek#5253
makes sense

[01-May-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
FUCK YEAH

[01-May-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so TA "works" in the sense that it does increase your prediction accuracy, but the illusion that it works as well as it does in crypto is more from whales painting TA patterns for the newbs to feed on

[01-May-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
whales need food too

[01-May-19 12:21 PM] Tek#5253
i can sell dash for 0.5% gains

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
maybe I should wait

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
but I wanted to sell dash, then buy back bch

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
this day trading of yours is like casino

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
bet on black!

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
no red.

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
thats bc it is

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
flip a coin

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
I'm just trying this until I become a bagholder

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you wont

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] Tek#5253
i hope not

[01-May-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you need a 100x gainer

[01-May-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
Im trying to trade up this stack of ZEC i sold yesterday

[01-May-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
find something microcap that will become decent sized to get 100x

[01-May-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it takes a bull cycle, a bit more than 3 hours

[01-May-19 12:23 PM] Tek#5253
I don't want to gamble on absolute shitcoins at the bottom

[01-May-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
I normally don't trade at all, but some days I do

[01-May-19 12:24 PM] Tek#5253
and then its like the casino

[01-May-19 12:25 PM] Tek#5253
I admit it is

[01-May-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok. as long as you do

[01-May-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is to find coins that have quality, even though they are at the bottom

[01-May-19 12:26 PM] Tek#5253
I do only trade quality coins so I don't have to cry when I become a bagholder

[01-May-19 12:27 PM] Markus#5464
KMD can be a 100x if it one day gets the recognition it deserves to  start a hype around it like binance

[01-May-19 12:27 PM] Tek#5253
bought a few hundred kmd today heh. ( tfw poor )

[01-May-19 12:28 PM] Markus#5464
maybe not best comparison ðŸ˜„

[01-May-19 12:28 PM] Tek#5253
dash saw an inflation reduction last month

[01-May-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
hope it will mean an increase of price

[01-May-19 12:29 PM] Tek#5253
dash is doing 1/14th every year instead of 1/2 every 4 years like btc

[01-May-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
thats only 25% reduction every 4 years, so the inflation rate is reducing much slower than BTC

[01-May-19 12:31 PM] Tek#5253
yea they have a more gradual reduction
