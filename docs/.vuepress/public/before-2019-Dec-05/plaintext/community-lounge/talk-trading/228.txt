@twittler when u create a new wallet seed always write it down along with the address. Logout and then login again to make sure the address is the same. Saftey first :)

What was the original ICO price for KMD?

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
0.20$ iirc

[17-Oct-18 09:04 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or something along those lines

So the richest address has 7mio, assuming he got all for ico price, that's still 1.4mio dollar. WTF and he claims the rewards, rewards alone are massive

[17-Oct-18 09:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
He started getting coins in DEC 2017

[17-Oct-18 09:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
oh damn, true first one 8th dec

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
~3$

[17-Oct-18 09:09 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
jesus

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Been buying a lot lately

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Still nog clear who the megawhale might be

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
All we know is that he‚Äôs buying from binance

[17-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Might be a whale, might be binance coldstorage, but it seems more and more unlikely

[17-Oct-18 09:11 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
the whale or the coldstorage theory?

[17-Oct-18 09:12 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I kinda imagine binance would split their adresses to minimize risk?

[17-Oct-18 09:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Coldstorage less likely

[17-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But a whale would also split to minimize?

[17-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its not logical for binance to have 10% of coinsupply?

[17-Oct-18 09:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
With other wallets combined

[17-Oct-18 09:20 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I don't consider it logical for binance to have only one cold storage wallet. Most big exchanges would split it up into multiple cold wallets.

[17-Oct-18 09:22 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
150k in unclaimed rewards on that guy. Daaaaaaamn

[17-Oct-18 09:22 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"Claim it and Make it rain kmd god"

[17-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it possible to put an alert on outgoing transactions on that addy alone

[17-Oct-18 09:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Big chance it‚Äôs held on ledger?

[17-Oct-18 09:24 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
PLan to sell once he does ^^?

[17-Oct-18 09:27 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Is there no history at all of reward claims? Cos thats gonna be one hell of a miner reward

[17-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No, point insane hashpower to kmd to try and pick up unclaimed intrest @bpkdasbaum

[17-Oct-18 09:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@CryptoNinjaa for that address?

[17-Oct-18 09:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
51% kmd could pay off for a block reward like that lol yes

[17-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No if whale doesnt claim intrest it goes to the miners. The one that mines that block gets the entire intrest block

[17-Oct-18 09:29 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
lolwut? you get bonus as miner if the transaction someone else did was a reward claim?

[17-Oct-18 09:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Monthly claim now isnt it

[17-Oct-18 09:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
He hasnt claimed intrest ever

[17-Oct-18 09:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Unclaimed rewards become miner rewards

[17-Oct-18 09:30 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
It was yearly but since block 1 mil its monthly

[17-Oct-18 09:30 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Even the exchange wallet rewards become miner rewards

[17-Oct-18 09:31 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
not sure I understand, anything above the 1 month mark that "would" earn? Or is it possible to "steal" the whole reward through mining if he doesn't claim ever, so currently his 150k unclaimed reward?

[17-Oct-18 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@bpkdasbaum Each UTXO over 10 accrues a reward over time, when you send that UTXO and do not claim that reward for yourself it has to go *somewhere*, so in lieu of it "diapering" it goes to whomever mines the block the tx is in

[17-Oct-18 09:33 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So yes 150k could come up if that dude does not claim it

[17-Oct-18 09:33 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
oh wow, okay thanks

[17-Oct-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
rewards can only be claimed if/when the UTXO is "spent"

[17-Oct-18 09:34 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
so, if he never moves it, no one ever gets the reward

[17-Oct-18 09:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If he moved some funds he will claim some rewards

[17-Oct-18 09:34 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
^^lol

[17-Oct-18 09:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So maybe it is cold

[17-Oct-18 09:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Wasn't there a clause, that if you never moved funds you keep accruing rewards under the old system?

[17-Oct-18 09:35 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
So he is still getting benefits of the 1 year system right?

[17-Oct-18 09:35 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
All them $ and not claiming doesnt make sense tbh

[17-Oct-18 09:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Not sure

[17-Oct-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
pre-1M it accrued up to max of 1 year; post-1M it's max 1 month

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[17-Oct-18 09:36 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
after that, it's capped in both systems

[17-Oct-18 09:36 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Makes sense

[17-Oct-18 09:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
So there will be less up for grabs most likley

[17-Oct-18 09:37 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
"As this is a consensus rules change, it will need to activate at a future height and all existing utxos will still operate under the old rules, so this will only affect new utxo created after the activation height of 1 million."

[17-Oct-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@webworker01 iirc, yes; but I didn't want to confuse folks even more üòõ

[17-Oct-18 09:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I wonder how much is >1mill block

[17-Oct-18 09:39 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
checking right now

[17-Oct-18 09:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
(amount)(5.1%/12)

[17-Oct-18 09:41 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
7th Septemberr, just a month ago

[17-Oct-18 09:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
~6 mio are still in the yearly system for him

[17-Oct-18 09:43 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
so he has time till 8th december 2018 to get the yearly reward

[17-Oct-18 09:43 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Adds to calendar

[17-Oct-18 09:45 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
There will be a few ks then. Lets see if he collects.

[17-Oct-18 09:45 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
But then again, it's also dead weight at the same time right? This is all speculative, if he doesn't have anyone to sell to. It might as well be 0. Unless he siphons it veeeeery slowly

[17-Oct-18 09:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
You coudn't take profit with 7 mio at once

[17-Oct-18 09:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
but you could definentely decide the price for whatever you want it to be

[17-Oct-18 09:46 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i was thinking the same. Would kill a big move

[17-Oct-18 09:46 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
and buy more lower

[17-Oct-18 09:47 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

Screw the whale

[17-Oct-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
don't sell, buy more -- I need another new car

[17-Oct-18 09:48 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[17-Oct-18 09:48 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004

Pretty sure the whale will be back later, seems to be coming and going

[17-Oct-18 11:06 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I realized just now, that the 5% KMD reward are more than any saving accounts will give from normal banks

[17-Oct-18 11:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
about 20 years ago I remember my grandfather used to tell/teach me how to use/see a bank book.
important lessons for a little kid from wise man.

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
they showed how banks gives interest if you save money in an account.

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those things are totally missing as I grown up.

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
i remember getting 7-8% or so on a savings account as a kid

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the simplest the book managing it was the better the banking it was too back then.

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
we may see big changes when it comes to that with crypto

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
banking is made unnecessarily complicated now.

[17-Oct-18 11:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

i have been listening to a lot of Alex Mashinski talk about crypto lending.  Celsius is offering 3-5% on crypto deposits.  if banks arent pooping their britches yet, they arent paying attention

[17-Oct-18 11:11 PM] meatspoon#7860
grew, you would like what Mashinski has to say

[17-Oct-18 11:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
@bpkdasbaum  i am in my 40's.  but growing up in the 80's, man those interest rates could make a saver out of anyone.

[17-Oct-18 11:13 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I had a saving account back in 2000 with 6% interest.

[17-Oct-18 11:14 PM] meatspoon#7860
its a shame what the Fed has done to this country, its currency and the incentive to save and be prudent
