@hyperDEX  I heard that dentacoin was revealed to a scam or a project going nowhere (I didn't read details), it can explain that it went towards zero

[12-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
> denta coin

[12-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253
the name alone

[12-Jul-19 09:21 PM] Tek#5253

when a scam coin disappears it seems like 5 others pop up in it's place.

 In the 90‚Äôs it was an experiment to go online. Today, it‚Äôs an experiment to go offline.

Today, it‚Äôs and experiment to live with crypto. Soon, it will be an experiment to live without it.

@phm87 bitconnect was up there too so not surprised. The fact that James and the team have been able to keep KMD in the top 50 after this amount of time and limited budget says a lot

[12-Jul-19 09:42 PM] phm87#7395
I was also thinking about bitconnect when I wrote to you ^^ I agree about KMD

[12-Jul-19 09:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Look at siacoin./bitshares/dragonchain lol

[12-Jul-19 09:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I have a funny feeling that the market has not priced in Komodo being able to rebrand, so the 15th will be intetesting

[12-Jul-19 09:45 PM] phm87#7395
why rebrand and hardfork are both on the 15th ?

[12-Jul-19 09:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
fireworks üòõ

[12-Jul-19 09:46 PM] phm87#7395
yeah to limit costs I agree

[12-Jul-19 09:46 PM] phm87#7395
but james won't be able to make the rebrand speach if he is helping and monitoring new NN

[12-Jul-19 09:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The marketing team will do it it seems. That reminds me need to spend time today getting the crypto youtuber links and time slots

[12-Jul-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
I still don't agree with some choices here : you'll be able to fire more fireworks if hardfork and rebrand are not on the same date

[12-Jul-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
after elections of NN, I heard about a form to fill about marketing of new NN, I didn't had any news from this

[12-Jul-19 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But the hardfork is to activate notaries

[12-Jul-19 09:53 PM] phm87#7395
yes

[12-Jul-19 09:54 PM] phm87#7395
new NN can make tweets or talk about the suceessfull hardfork (and team is busy so reducing ressources to support rebrand)

[12-Jul-19 09:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is not something users care about, sure it is a little bit og marketing writing blogs etc

[12-Jul-19 09:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But that can happen after too right? Rebrand and getting atomicDEX out is more important

[12-Jul-19 09:55 PM] phm87#7395
dpow / NN are still a very powerful and well known super cool feature of KMD, it is a marketing diamond

[12-Jul-19 09:59 PM] wolfgang#3508
lol

[12-Jul-19 09:59 PM] wolfgang#3508
people talking about dentacoin again

[12-Jul-19 10:01 PM] phm87#7395
in my mind, marketing should not be alone and all team members should retweet, support and share msgs from marketing (I'm serious). A tweet from jl777 himself can have a bigger impact than marketing or official KMD accounts. To compare, tweets from LN devs can contain more value/infos than all tweets from marketing/official LN accounts (lightninglabs, blockstream ...)

[12-Jul-19 10:22 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That would mean getting jl777 a twitter account üòÉ

I agree, there needs to be community marketing and we should all do our part

ugh, im getting paid like $700 in two weeks, and then itll take 2 more weeks for coinbase to allow me to move funds.

[12-Jul-19 10:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
by then, what cldve been like 400 kmd will be more like 50

[12-Jul-19 10:38 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
stoopid mooning

[12-Jul-19 10:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
damn, coinbase takes 2 weeks to give you btc now?

[12-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Malti#3948
Kmd at top 3 of cmc and 100$ would be possible if everybody would stop dumping whenever it makes moves and starts holding it

[12-Jul-19 11:06 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I used to instant buy on coinbase

[12-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Haven‚Äôt bought BTC since like $250-300 though

[12-Jul-19 11:07 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How times change

[12-Jul-19 11:29 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
its instant buy, but if you wantto swnd the btc to binance to exhange it doesnt let you move it out for 2 weeks

[12-Jul-19 11:30 PM] p.#1126
send eth or ltc maybe?

[12-Jul-19 11:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
same thing

[12-Jul-19 11:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
whatever u buy, its two weeks

[12-Jul-19 11:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they make it different for every person though

[12-Jul-19 11:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
idk why

[12-Jul-19 11:35 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
a friend of mine only got 5 days and another got 20 days

[12-Jul-19 11:36 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
mine used to be 10 days then they made it 14

[12-Jul-19 11:40 PM] Alecandro#1179
Unless you buy with a debit card. It‚Äôs instant transfer out but higher fee

[12-Jul-19 11:43 PM] FlyingDutchman#5213
they only let you do $50 per week with card

[12-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Anyone know anything about these two addresses?

RTZi9uC1wEu3PD9eoL4R7KyeAse7uvdHuS
RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA

[12-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c or someone?

[12-Jul-19 11:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Verus agama bungles KMD interest when making a standard tx

[12-Jul-19 11:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Rewards went to that RTZ address for some reason

[12-Jul-19 11:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
But they appear to have small transactions running through there constantly

[12-Jul-19 11:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Then moved to the second address

[13-Jul-19 12:05 AM] SHossain#0007
RXL3 is the address where we send notary tx

[13-Jul-19 12:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
And claim your interest in verus agama first before making a tx

[13-Jul-19 12:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Hmmm

[13-Jul-19 12:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So it was sent then to a notary

[13-Jul-19 12:05 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Like the originally busted interest handling?

[13-Jul-19 12:06 AM] SHossain#0007
how did you claim reward?

[13-Jul-19 12:06 AM] SHossain#0007
seems your reward wasn't claimed properly and sent to miner

[13-Jul-19 12:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I just made a tx without claiming

[13-Jul-19 12:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
KMD agama used to handle it properly

[13-Jul-19 12:06 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
It appears verus still doesn‚Äôt

[13-Jul-19 12:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do I get a bug reward :abusedsmily:

[13-Jul-19 12:07 AM] SHossain#0007
@ùôäùôûùô£ùô† maybe this is something you can look at ^^

[13-Jul-19 12:07 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I‚Äôll add to my comments in their GUI channel

[13-Jul-19 12:08 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i guess this can be fixed.

[13-Jul-19 12:08 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm not an expert on this though :abused_smiley:

[13-Jul-19 12:10 AM] SHossain#0007
@Hollowman9000 why don't you use Ledger now? reward claim is very easy and 0% fee for reward claim using this https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

i quite like this personally

[13-Jul-19 12:11 AM] phm87#7395
@SHossain about interests claiming, I have some KMD on coinomi waiting, I can export privatekeys. If I import all the priv keys into a normal komodo daemon (cli), can I simply claim interests with sendtoaddress to myself ?

[13-Jul-19 12:12 AM] SHossain#0007
you can check first if you have any accrued reward https://dexstats.info/rewards.php

[13-Jul-19 12:12 AM] SHossain#0007
then, you can use WIF

[13-Jul-19 12:12 AM] phm87#7395
coins didn't move since a month

[13-Jul-19 12:13 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not about moving. it's about locktime

[13-Jul-19 12:13 AM] SHossain#0007
as far as i know coinomi doesn't set locktime

[13-Jul-19 12:13 AM] phm87#7395
so I won't have accrued rewards

[13-Jul-19 12:14 AM] phm87#7395
if I move all the KMD to a normal komodo daemon, can I turn it off after ? Is there a special option about locktime ?

[13-Jul-19 12:16 AM] SHossain#0007
import key and then send to self

[13-Jul-19 12:43 AM] Alexfrog#1338
so verus agama has a problem with rewards?

[13-Jul-19 12:46 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not really, it works fine for me

[13-Jul-19 12:46 AM] SHossain#0007
no issue if you do normal claim

[13-Jul-19 12:46 AM] SHossain#0007
sometimes, if you send to external address before claiming, the reward may not be collected and sent to miner

Jesus, which wallet are we supposed to use?  There was an Official Announcement saying to use the Versus Agama... now Rewards, which is an integral part of KMD ownership is not working there?  Can the project with the "best tech" maybe work out their wallet situation?

[13-Jul-19 01:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@meatspoon I didn‚Äôt use the claim rewards button first if that matters

[13-Jul-19 01:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
If you have rewards, hit the claim button first before doing business

[13-Jul-19 01:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or you‚Äôll donate to the notaries/miners

[13-Jul-19 01:34 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
As I did
