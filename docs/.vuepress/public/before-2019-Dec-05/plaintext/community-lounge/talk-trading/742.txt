[05-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
Because the supply is effectively reduced

[05-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912

[05-Jun-19 07:52 AM] Alexfrog#1338

I get connection error with the vrsc wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:42 AM] McBeastie#0134
with both electrum server connections

[05-Jun-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
generate a secure new address with the vrsc wallet

[05-Jun-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
use the tainted agama to send to that new address

[05-Jun-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
DONT use the seed/privkey of the secure address in the tainted agama

[05-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Bittersweet#9376
@ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢ not me, i was sad last time I thought you left
I was talking about racist unemployed guy

[05-Jun-19 08:47 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
Hollow?

[05-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Haha, no, I don't talk shit to hollow

[05-Jun-19 08:48 AM] Bittersweet#9376
That's your job

[05-Jun-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Pretty sure it's @Tek he's talking about :p

[05-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hollow not unemployed I think? Racist not sure but dont think so either

[05-Jun-19 09:05 AM] aka222#2811
Hey does the Agama notice also include mobile version as well?

[05-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[05-Jun-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if it says "agama" then it is agama

[05-Jun-19 09:07 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Cryptoon I still haven't figured out if hollow is a maga-type or good at playing one ü§∑üèΩ

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
he is above average maga type

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
hahaha

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] BlockTech#6895
Is digitalprice.io safe ?

[05-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Bittersweet#9376
I would say he's maga in his own way

[05-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Bittersweet#9376
it was indeed @Tek

[05-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Mr I hate immigrants because they cost us money so I will be unemployed in protest and do nothing with my life

[05-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Checkmate

[05-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Sdunbar#5064
native mode agama is a risk too or just the lite ?

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] klein#5233
read a few comments above you

[05-Jun-19 09:14 AM] klein#5233
by james

[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] klein#5233
and the pinned messages

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
native modes are not affected. until you used the WIF from native mode to login into Lite mode

[05-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so if you havent exported/imported your native WIF keys from/into agama you should be fine

[05-Jun-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but you wont remember 100% of your usage commands to agama this year, so if you use agama, migrate

[05-Jun-19 09:26 AM] klein#5233
Could still keep going for awhile?

[05-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think those are sweeps, looks like making utxo?

[05-Jun-19 09:27 AM] klein#5233
ah ok

[05-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
they all add up to 50 - 100 - ... kmd

[05-Jun-19 09:31 AM] Keppie#5156
Just got a white page when opening up Agama

[05-Jun-19 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
@Bittersweet That can't be true, he's rich enough to call me a pleb

[05-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Keppie#5156

[05-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Keppie#5156

[05-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Keppie#5156

[05-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Keppie#5156

not much of a drop considering the news

[05-Jun-19 09:53 AM] alen#3721
I just read this on fb announcement...should we be worried?
Im at work..cant do shit now

[05-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Markus#5464
no

[05-Jun-19 09:58 AM] keda666#1678
At the time of first ANN, it dropped from 20k to 19k

[05-Jun-19 09:59 AM] klein#5233
@alen admin have swept vulnerable funds into an address controlled by them

[05-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Markus#5464
anyone looking at the chart would not be able to tell something like that happened....first we had a 11% gain and then 7% pullback

[05-Jun-19 10:00 AM] Alexfrog#1338
the 7% pullback was within minutes of the announcement

[05-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Markus#5464
we had bigger pullback when btc moved quick

[05-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah

[05-Jun-19 10:02 AM] Alexfrog#1338
whales arent selling this, its been handled well by devs i think

[05-Jun-19 10:02 AM] Markus#5464
Yea

[05-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Alexfrog#1338
and no coins are actually stolen.  devs got control of all vulnerable coins.  people will get them back.

[05-Jun-19 10:03 AM] alen#3721
Ok...so i can keep funds in agama without panicking

[05-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Alexfrog#1338
alen you should make a new wallet in komodo ocean and move funds there, but you dont have to panic about it

[05-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Alexfrog#1338
if you open your agama and see 0 KMD there, the devs have them

[05-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@alen better be safe and generate a new address using the steps here: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

[05-Jun-19 10:05 AM] klein#5233
is the address controlled by admins, that swept the vulnerable funds

[05-Jun-19 10:06 AM] Markus#5464
`jl777cToday at 9:23 AM
if your funds were swept to RSgD2cmm.....rEHoHMywJdkbkeF
plz follow the claim instructions ASAP`

[05-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Markus#5464
@klein yes

[05-Jun-19 10:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
There are some crazy block fees due to this

[05-Jun-19 10:17 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
We are QEing KMD!!!!!

[05-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Quantitative easing is not the same as the 5,1% blockrewards

[05-Jun-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the bigger blocks are due to people not claiming the rewards and thus forfeiting them to miners

[05-Jun-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
this will not increase supply more than in other situations

[05-Jun-19 10:19 AM] Markus#5464
Doubt all wallet owners will understand what happened cause many of them might not be on discord
