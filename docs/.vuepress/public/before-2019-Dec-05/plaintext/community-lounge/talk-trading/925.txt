ultimately either they go full totalitarian mode and ban crypto altogether or it's not effective

[15-Jul-19 06:10 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
especially once we have an economy where you can spend crypto directly to buy things

`cryptocurrencies MUST scale to pay coffee or bust`
I'm not sure that's possible for many of them
The greater the utility the greater the value and the more miners and FOMOites will push up tx costs and the less utility it will have

@Lejinad85 Mnuchin issued a warning to those not complying with US AML laws. No talk of a ban. Said specifically that bitcoin speculation is OK.

Based on the weekend's sell-off, seems key players knew in advance about this press conference, and sold into it. Seeing short ...

I mean basically what I gather is that as long as you arent spending btc on the web for kiddie porn, you're probably okay lol

[15-Jul-19 06:37 PM] actionslacks#4072
first the prez, now treasury secretary. seems like they're afraid

[15-Jul-19 06:38 PM] LocoMB#8593
good thing is that they seem to be lumping BTC/ open blockchians together with F***coin - which is an ominous misconception

[15-Jul-19 06:39 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
true, libre will be more decentralized :troll:

[15-Jul-19 06:39 PM] LocoMB#8593
also, if they are more afraid of Libra than BTC, they still haven't understood at all what they are dealing with

[15-Jul-19 06:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
i think Libra is the straw man in this argument. by lumping btc and libra together they're setting the stage to try and regulate ALL of it in one fell swoop. if anyone doubted that central bankers feel threatened by crypto, they should not now.

[15-Jul-19 07:34 PM] Markus#5464
And that is the whole point, for crypto to replace fiat so that it cant be manipulated the way fiat is

[15-Jul-19 07:35 PM] Markus#5464
non stop print

Isn't Tether trying to be the new crypto printing press

[15-Jul-19 07:35 PM] JimD#9272
Audit the tethers

[15-Jul-19 07:36 PM] Markus#5464
In my eyes Tether is just trying to collect as much btc as possible

[15-Jul-19 07:36 PM] Markus#5464
so whenever they get fucked by the government or so then they already got their piece of the cake

[15-Jul-19 07:37 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, Ive heard a lot of this current run is based on Tether manipulation

[15-Jul-19 07:37 PM] JimD#9272
but that is probably only part of the story
