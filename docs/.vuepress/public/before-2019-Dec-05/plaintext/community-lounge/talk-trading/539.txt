@Sherdogz  Yes, they take care of dPOw and so they are helping to secure the network. I hope any candidates will get no more than 1 node so Komodo is better seen as more decentralized.

`Is it important to vote for the notary node election?`
@Sherdogz imo, it's important to vote on *everything* that you care about and have the opportunity in life to vote on; you never know just how many "my vote doesn't matter"s could add up to mattering.

[13-Apr-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Sherdogz#6731
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you're right I didn't know what the goal for voting was. I have little knowledge about blockchain😊 I only focus on trading.

[13-Apr-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you vote on candidates that actively contribute a lot to the ecosystem, your holding benefit in the long run 😃

[13-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
some people fud that KMD is centralized or controlled by insiders. not sure how they can possibly think that is a supportable position. anybody, literally anybody without any KMD, but with good skills that helps the ecosystem is able to get a NN spot. Once elected, then there is a year long "competition" to notarize as much as possible to get the automatic spot. Now as far as being able to have some massive voting power, the 20,000 KMD is nice but less than 2% needed to win a spot and it is doubtful someone is voting for anybody but themselves to maximize their winning chances. not much power to vote their friends in. In any case, what I see is that the NN all work together as a tightly knit group and the competition is on the friendly side, with most helping the others. The better the NN perform as a group, the more secure KMD and the entire ecosystem is. most end up becoming friends with each other, regardless of who wins.

With the ever increasing number of candidates, I expect the 4 region NN to become harder and harder to maintain and for many more single region NN. For those that complain that existing notaries have an unfair advantage... if constantly notarizing for years doesnt give them an advantage, then i would say there is something wrong! The solid NN should be protected from the whimsy of the elections. With half the NN retained, the network is assured consistency and continuity, but with half up for grabs, a lot of new blood can enter the system, so it is a balance between stability and evolution.

[13-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
This annual election is the chance for the silent majority of KMD hodlers who are happily collecting the 5%+ per year to help improve the ecosystem by carefully considering the best candidate to support. After three years, we finally see a bit of "competition" in the dPoW space, but with the decentralization on a per notarization basis, there is no checks and balances on who is doing the notarization. With dPoW, the candidates are fully decentralized and the "blocktime" is one year, the KMD holders select the replacement NN for the bottom half. Once selected, all NN are highly motivated to notarize reliably and given that their performance is signed, it can be tracked and there is a great deal at stake. I estimate each NN spot is worth approx 40,000 KMD (20K in direct and 50% per year chance of being auto-elected).

[13-Apr-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
All mining gets approx 1.6 million KMD per year and NN collectively get 1.2 million. The 5% rewards this year will be approx 6 million KMD and as KMD supply increases, this amount will increase over the years, gradually shrinking the NN mined coins to about 0.6%. Even on the mining side, a significant 400,000 KMD per year are mined by external miners. All of this makes KMD have a unique coin emission mechanism and with the 5% accruing automatically, there is no need to be running a hot wallet 24/7. recently we are seeing the hardware wallets able to claim the rewards, which is certainly better than having to run a windows node.

Anyway, all NN mined coins are only about 20% of the 5% rewards.

Once how KMD coin emission actually works is understood, I doubt anybody is credibly claiming centralization or insider control.  dPoW is the most efficient way to prevent 51% attacks and is head and shoulders above all the other methods I know of. A fixed cost of a few thousand dollars to not have to worry about 51% attacks this is such a good deal, many dont even believe it is possible, even though it is running now for almost 3 years. Maybe dPoW was 4+ years ahead of its time

If you are a small holder, pick a candidate with proven tech skills that is supporting the things you feel most strongly about. individually you might think it doesnt matter, but cumulatively it will add up to a strong beneficial effect

[13-Apr-19 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362

you can also just send the VOTE2019 tokens directly to the candidate of your choosing

your KMD address will get 1:1 VOTE2019 coins. send them to your chosen candidate
