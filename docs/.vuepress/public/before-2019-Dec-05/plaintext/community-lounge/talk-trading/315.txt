Yes KMD will remain equihash

[28-Nov-18 05:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Assetchains too, which are existing. 
Or assetchains can also do snapshots and fork to change algo.
New assetchains can chose new verushash algo and options.

[28-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
More possibilities!

[28-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Freedom to choose!

When another tool is added to the toolbox, it does not mean that all future work will use that new tool. just that the new tool is available to be used. In other words, if you add a hammer to a toolbox, it does not mean you start using the hammer instead of a screwdriver. it just means if you need to hammer something, you have a hammer

[28-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
verushash is added to the available ac parameters. it does not mean that all future hashing will use verushash, just that verushash is available to be used

[28-Nov-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why many people use mutually exclusive logic when they hear something, ie. something new exists -> everything old is replaced

[28-Nov-18 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
that wouldnt be very backward compatible.

Hey guys, don't know if this is the right channel for this so please redirect me if there's somewhere better. Given that KMD deposits are down on Binance/Bittrex, I'm looking to do an OTC sale of around 7k KMD for BTC at a reasonable discount to market rate on the major exchanges. DM if interested.

[28-Nov-18 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the virtue of btc is that it can please all

[28-Nov-18 12:47 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
you want your priv keys to be handled by a surveilled, regulated entity? sure, go ahead.

[28-Nov-18 12:52 PM] snowdamn#2414
there will be markets for trad. crypto/regulasurveil, beats going into fiat and having to deposit at bank

[28-Nov-18 12:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
an option for those that had decided to show their chickens by going into fiat

[28-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
btc crossing 4200

[28-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
was 3600ish the bottom?

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
bear might actually be ending.

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
Wall Street are still criminals...

[28-Nov-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it touched close to $3000 on various actual USD fiat exchanges

[28-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
USDT trading seems to be at a higher pricepoint

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] snowdamn#2414
imagine how many people lost their shirts during 2018

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm checking btc/usd chart on finex

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh, don't invest more than you can afford to lose has always been a good adagio

[28-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sucks for those people nonetheless though

[28-Nov-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
time to sell the house, the children and the wife

[28-Nov-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
cash out life insurance

[28-Nov-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
take a 100k loan

[28-Nov-18 01:03 PM] snowdamn#2414
if it had bled a little bit more, i would have been able to pick up all the crypto i sold end of 2017 with only 5% of the fiat gained
but it didn't so now we wait 
can't have it all üòÉ

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Jeff berwick told all his subscribers to buy a matter of hours ago

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so its rising

[28-Nov-18 01:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he told everyone to sell all year for entry at thes price

[28-Nov-18 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is Jeff, selling the house and the wife?

[28-Nov-18 01:05 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
:trollface:

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
he said he would borrow against all of he metals and property

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
:trollface:

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont subscribe to him btw

[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they accidently send me the newsletter for free .. not sure how that works but ive goten it over a year now despite never paying for it

[28-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the more subscribers, the higher the advert rates

[28-Nov-18 01:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He seems to move price very easily upon making an announcment

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Most times i have read one the price moved accordingly

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hes either very good at predicting markets or has a LOT of very rich subscribers and freinds

[28-Nov-18 01:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
Maybe a little of column A, a little of column B.

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think that its nto like he is always 100% right

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but more than he should be

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
goin by chance

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no one moves prices at will, but they can influence

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
He has been consistent with his calls all year

[28-Nov-18 01:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
every month, without changing them ... timing was not exact but price was

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that has to make some kind of diffrence

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if he just said "buy now"

[28-Nov-18 01:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i doubt much would happen

[28-Nov-18 01:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[28-Nov-18 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
dont think it will end so fast

[28-Nov-18 01:24 PM] jorian#4555
mind you, we need to do a 100% to get to 8000

[28-Nov-18 01:27 PM] snowdamn#2414
anything above $7.5k will be very healthy

[28-Nov-18 01:28 PM] snowdamn#2414
$7.8k actually üòú

[28-Nov-18 01:29 PM] jorian#4555
go buy some then üòÑ

[28-Nov-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
likely a retest will happen after this little upwave

[28-Nov-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the daily chart still looks quite bearish

[28-Nov-18 01:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Can confirm bear over my short got liquidated üòÇ üôà

[28-Nov-18 01:42 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

[28-Nov-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if it closes back inside, the changes for another retest of weekly 200sma diminish a lot

[28-Nov-18 01:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we will see a retest of weekly 8ema which is above $5k

[28-Nov-18 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
once that is done, we might see more sideways or another drop but i doubt it will make LL

[28-Nov-18 01:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this weekly 200sma (small line below price in my chart) is the last frontier

[28-Nov-18 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if that gets confirmed broken, it will be the longest winter in crypto

[28-Nov-18 01:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i dont think it will.

[28-Nov-18 01:53 PM] snowdamn#2414
Wall Street criminals are probably perplexed by how well we take the punches

[28-Nov-18 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
More like they are perplexed by the irrationality that almost every crypto is tied to the fate of BTC
It's akin to nasdaq tying the fate of all stocks to amazon üò£

[28-Nov-18 01:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats not exactly false either man ü§£

[28-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
nasdaq == amazon

[28-Nov-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
lol

[28-Nov-18 01:58 PM] snowdamn#2414
lol

[28-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe more appropriate is USD and all fiat currencies ... ü§∑

[28-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if USD fails ... does all fiat fail ?

[28-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ü§î

[28-Nov-18 02:01 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`if USD fails ... does all fiat fail ?`
yes

[28-Nov-18 02:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
if you said any other currency i would say no, but if the $ it will sure take some down with it

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so then if BTC fails does all of crypto ..?

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its kind of the exact same at this point

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
USD fail = no other countries get USD as aid or repayment = collapse of modern society

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
welll we are in for a bumpy ride

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
üòÑ

[28-Nov-18 02:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
becasue its goign down

[28-Nov-18 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
maybe crypto would die, but i think they are incomparable as the USD is very intertwined with many real world things. where as btc is just drug dealer money ü§£

üëÜüèΩ 

[28-Nov-18 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Well ... yes ... this is true... A lot of drug dealers stopped dealing drugs last year thats for sure.

[28-Nov-18 02:06 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
what you mean its traceable ....

[28-Nov-18 02:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its onlt trabacle if someone actually looks

[28-Nov-18 02:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
At least in this country, its KYC/AML on all fiat exchagne and msot people just bought sent directly to alphabay and brought to their won house ... cant say anyone really got done by it ... sure there was people who got caught, but it was all from normal policw work.
