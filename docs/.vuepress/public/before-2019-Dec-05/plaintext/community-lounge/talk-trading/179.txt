WTB 5000 pirate for 350KMD

[29-Sep-18 07:00 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@hatchikoxxl You're about a week too late to get any at that price

[29-Sep-18 07:01 AM] hatchikoxxl#8427
No sorry its a good price for that ;)

[29-Sep-18 07:02 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
selling to you at 30% below market is good for no one except you

[29-Sep-18 07:04 AM] hatchikoxxl#8427
You think so but i dont think so, only KMD is the real value

[29-Sep-18 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
You see no value in privacy?

[29-Sep-18 07:06 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Which govt do you work for?

[29-Sep-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
a theoretical question.
If there is a high liquidity 0% trading fee small spread market between two things
how is owning one much different from owning the other?

[29-Sep-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a difference

[29-Sep-18 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Sep-18 07:12 AM] hatchikoxxl#8427

[29-Sep-18 07:16 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Well, get your mind right before you can't even get it at twice what you're trying 游땔

[29-Sep-18 07:18 AM] hatchikoxxl#8427
Hehe for me is kmd the king and more value :parrot:

[29-Sep-18 07:19 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
@hatchikoxxl tell me what "real value" KMD has that PIRATE does not?

[29-Sep-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
and if your answer has anything to do with a central exchange, you missed the point of KMD and all that goes with it

[29-Sep-18 08:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

`WTS 2500 PIRATE @ 0.1 KMD`
`Order sizes 100-2500 PIRATE`

[29-Sep-18 08:25 AM] snowdamn#2414
KMD vs. PIRATE comparison (in the value context) makes sense if you only have KMD available for conversion

Does the option exist to change pirates name down the road?

[29-Sep-18 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004

the other thing to keep in mind is that without the onboarding deal, there's less and less people that haven't already bought

[29-Sep-18 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
