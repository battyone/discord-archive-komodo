not sure but if the volume is bigger than what the cheapest order could take, it won't match with that one , if the one you select has the volume, it will match with that

I've seen 2 reports of people having problems connecting to Komodo in Native mode, which apparently was solved by compiling a new komodo daemon using the dev branch.
Verus is close to releasing a new wallet. As I understood it will also include a new Komodo daemon.

[30-Nov-19 07:10 PM] Flint#6435
Pirate is good at ranking nodes bypassing Komodo which has 51 nodes! but Horizen (more likely a competitor to Pirate APPP than Komodo) who once was attacked is steadily gaining momentum and even outperformed bitcoin in terms of the number of nodes, and as follows from the article, the number of nodes is a more objective metric for evaluating projects than CMC üëá

[30-Nov-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
the data seems to be very wrong. there are far more than 51 KMD nodes, more like 1000+

[30-Nov-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
also, ZEN has so many nodes due to the masternode rewards and these are basically subsidized from the blockreward

[30-Nov-19 07:22 PM] jl777c#5810
ranking coins by how much they subsidize nodes... it seems a bit random

[30-Nov-19 07:34 PM] cipi#4502
the article mentions that they used the data from https://kmdexplorer.io/status for the number of nodes
but that does not represent the total number of nodes on the network

[30-Nov-19 07:35 PM] cipi#4502
and atm https://kmdexplorer.io/status shows 90... it also depends on when then daemon was restarted and how it is configured

[30-Nov-19 07:36 PM] CHMEX#0686
Not very accurate research from them.
They should spin up a few nodes in different regions and dump getpeerinfo and analyse the distinct ips

[30-Nov-19 07:37 PM] cipi#4502
pretty sure .onion are not acounted at all because the daemon on kmdexplorer.io does not used tor
yes, they should collect the data over a longer period of time

[30-Nov-19 07:37 PM] cipi#4502
and from different sources

[30-Nov-19 07:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
There are at least 64 nodes plus all the exchanges

[30-Nov-19 07:38 PM] CHMEX#0686
51 is just silly

[30-Nov-19 07:40 PM] SHossain#0007
i had over 90 conns on my nodes

[30-Nov-19 07:40 PM] cipi#4502
yes, a simple `komodo-cli getinfo` shows `"connections": 105` üôÇ

[30-Nov-19 07:41 PM] Flint#6435
nonetheless most will swallow it! maybe you can somehow influence the correct display in such ratings because the metric of the number of nodes estimate does not become useless from the fact that the data is not completely correct and therefore it would be great to have an updated actual tool for displaying node growth which would be a great driving force for Komodo

[30-Nov-19 07:43 PM] Flint#6435
But is this a unique and best metric for evaluating projects, or is the author disingenuous?

[30-Nov-19 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
this is not a proper way of evaluating projects. at least they didn't do research and didn't gather enough data

[30-Nov-19 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
looks like they scraped some data and called it research?

[30-Nov-19 07:48 PM] Flint#6435
it seems like that! but what to do with the lack of this truth for ordinary users who read it and believe everything without verification, but there will be the majority of them, and then Horizen fans will then repost it all over the Internet

[30-Nov-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
ZEN pays to have more nodes. does that make ZEN a better coin?

[30-Nov-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it is artificial. likely article written by someone with ZEN

[30-Nov-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
30,000 nodes is just a silly number of nodes considering the unique users is likely much smaller

[30-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Flint#6435
new users in ZEN will be bribed by another important fact that ZEN did not have ICO and premine, as well as at the moment, along with bitcoin, one of the most stable trends on the market, and now we add here even a fake number of nodes, but in total there are a lot of positive factors in the struggle for the user

[30-Nov-19 08:09 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Regarding the DEX order, I can try to buy the next more expensive order, but it still matches with the cheapest. Which fails

[30-Nov-19 08:10 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Using MM2 or Android

[30-Nov-19 08:15 PM] Flint#6435
@Patrick Crypto liquidity unfortunately leaves much to be desired and there are very few orders in the order book and orders at reasonable prices are even smaller only orders designed for inexperienced users who peck for the sake of interest in an order that is 30-50% lower than the real market price but since competition is in price No, then these orders are hanging no one needs

[30-Nov-19 08:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@Patrick Crypto try putting higher price and try buying slightly less than than what bob is selling

[30-Nov-19 08:23 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@SHossain I have tried that. It forces the match with the 20kmd order. I've had about 6 failed swaps because of that order

[30-Nov-19 08:31 PM] Patrick Crypto#1546
which is typically the desired behavior, but there is apparently something wrong with that order

[01-Dec-19 12:12 AM] saturday#4156
@Patrick Crypto I have same failed swap. I think that 20kmd-dex order have problem.

You could learn how to install Ubuntu. Especially if you are going to use crypto.  It's very easy to do.

[01-Dec-19 08:13 AM] Mark81#4505
@BoBot-BUY KMD  you are trying to active native mode for your wallet?

[01-Dec-19 08:15 AM] Mark81#4505
Crashing might be happen due to bad exit from native mode and because of that your downloaded blockchain files being corrupt.

[01-Dec-19 08:19 AM] Mark81#4505
I had last week problem with verus native mode. I had to remove blockchain files and install them from bootstrap and after that wallet loaded fine. Another way is to remove blockchain files and just let wallet to resync but it takes some time.

[01-Dec-19 08:20 AM] Mark81#4505
Blockchain files for agama  verus coin are in folder %appdata%\komodo\VRSC

[01-Dec-19 08:26 AM] Mark81#4505
Inside that folder you need to backup wallet.dat file into safe place. And after that AND only after that you can remove everything else EXCEPT  wallet.dat file. (Taking copy is precaution if worst happens since it hold coins and losing that causes PERMANENT loss of your coins). Now after that you can unzip verus bootstrap to this same folder or just start agama and it starts resync).

[01-Dec-19 08:30 AM] Mark81#4505
Take note also that %appdata%\komodo holds komodos blochain files and ALSO its ASSETCHAIN files in subdirectories like for verus in under VRSC so you must be careful when you play with these since those holds all information to coins in wallet.dat files.
