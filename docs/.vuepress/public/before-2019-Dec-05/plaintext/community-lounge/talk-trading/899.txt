Look at waves 15.5k to 19k in 1 candle

[06-Jul-19 11:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
a few other alts kinda the same

[06-Jul-19 11:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@allbits It makes a lot of sense,  opens new forms of liquidity to illiquid markets .

[07-Jul-19 12:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You have to trust that the holder of that asset will not sell the asset and run away üòõ

[07-Jul-19 12:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Then you have a tort claim to file against them

[07-Jul-19 12:07 AM] allbits#5898
Crypto not required for that since trust is elemental in the relationship already

[07-Jul-19 12:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yep

[07-Jul-19 12:08 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@polycryptoblog nothing can be done if they declare bankruptcy

[07-Jul-19 12:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Let me give an example of how crypto can be used in this ,  I am working on something to this effect currently.  A crypto token as a warehouse receipt.   Sure you can give a piece of paper receipt or an email .  But those are forgable.  And signing is an additional action required in normal receipts where sending a token implicit requires a personally identifying signature.    When you are trying to bridge the gap between real world and digital there is going to be a need of some gateway individuals and businesses .  But a token is just as much a legal claim as the paper receipt is.  And has more benefits in terms of durability, interoperability, function, unforgability, and immutability.

[07-Jul-19 12:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Trustlessness is not the only reason to use a blockchain

[07-Jul-19 12:21 AM] allbits#5898
Like this?

[07-Jul-19 12:24 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Like that yes,  but traditional EWR systems still have the issues found in centralized systems ( mutability , lack of function and interoperability ,  forgability )

[07-Jul-19 12:25 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hence why investigating blockchain usage for this case

[07-Jul-19 12:25 AM] allbits#5898
Ok

[07-Jul-19 12:25 AM] allbits#5898
I don't know enough about that market to comment

[07-Jul-19 12:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs interesting given what we are doing with Atomicdex and other tech being built in the ecosystem

Maybe some reason has come to market?

[07-Jul-19 07:40 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
It has been revealed that jl777 is a cousin of satoshi

[07-Jul-19 07:40 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
So it is only fair that kmd is a significant part of the ecosystem

[07-Jul-19 07:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
wouldn't count on it. kmd could unceremoniously dump after the 15th it wouldn't surprise me in the least

it could be that all these years of hard work are finally going to break through the bs. kmd should at least be top 20 in a logical market

[07-Jul-19 07:47 AM] Keppie#5156
But sir, etc is the future. & what about Cardano & tron ?? And Eos &  XRP! :troll:

kmd's recent rise seems pretty organic. real people buying, not just fake exchange games. at least I hope.

[07-Jul-19 08:51 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Have you seen what's on the top 20?

[07-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Still a lot of soulless coins

[07-Jul-19 08:54 AM] Bittersweet#9376

Away

[07-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Krryypton#5637
@alen , not going to happen. BCH will eventually follow BTC and become a pure store of value. LTC will do the same.

[07-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Ï∞®ÎØ∏Ïàô#8912
I can assure you one bitcoin diamond will equal to one bitcoin diamond

@Krryypton i know..i just cant help myself..i tried to be rational about BCH but i still hate it..im a psycho

[07-Jul-19 11:15 AM] Markus#5464
Bsv should already be dead at this point....basically everything CSW does is lie and ppl putting him in place in court. Have to be pretty embarassing

[07-Jul-19 11:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Markus i am sure Craig believes all the crap he is saying, just like Trump is

[07-Jul-19 11:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Buy support is doing well i must say

[07-Jul-19 11:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Trump is a pathological liar that wanted to lose the election

[07-Jul-19 11:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
He wanted fame and money, not to actually win

[07-Jul-19 11:29 AM] alen#3721
I dont like trump..but i have to admit..he is good..he aint dumb as he wants is to believe..i think he knows very good what he is doing. He might be an asshole but he sure is  not stupid

If current parabolic phase is violated, we could expect either an 80% correction of 7-month advance or much smaller correction w/ definition of new parabola w/ shallower slope. $BTC Note formation of possible 2-wk H&S or H&S failure

meh- these topics are openers of cans of worms - I am not sure if this is suitable for casual trading conversation
of course I have my own views on this- hint: Hillary Clinton is a psychopath of the worst kind, which should be clear to anyone capable of using the internets - but this would better belong into #fightclub

[07-Jul-19 12:01 PM] Caglio#3337

[07-Jul-19 12:02 PM] Caglio#3337
halving is supposed to be in like a month

[07-Jul-19 12:02 PM] Markus#5464
well if u have bitcoin and want ltc then u might get some gain when fomo before halvening kicks in if it happens that will say

[07-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
i have no bitcoin atm

[07-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
only ltc and kmd

[07-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
and some kmd based coins

[07-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Caglio#3337
but i feel after btc jumped ltc still hasnt followed and it kinda always does

[07-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Markus#5464
then i would wait, u will probably make more on kmd then ltc

[07-Jul-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
ok, so more kmd then

[07-Jul-19 12:04 PM] Markus#5464
its 25% to 20k afterall

[07-Jul-19 12:04 PM] Markus#5464
not sure if ltc can do that in btc value

[07-Jul-19 12:04 PM] Caglio#3337
indeed

[07-Jul-19 12:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Im pretty sure ltc halving already factored into current price
