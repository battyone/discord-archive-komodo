In this example funding of 78 millions was a lie

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Revealing partner at first expo was a lie

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Working closely with kmd devs was a lie

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Lie after lie after lie

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
Then again, we will answer all questions in that ama = lie

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
constant group of lies

[16-Aug-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
repeating while they can

[16-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
meanwhile, you dumped kmd into shitty coin

[16-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
so, after so many lies.... its not just a shitty product I bought ( blaming only myself )

[16-Aug-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
it seems like someone fed you lies on purpose, just to unload and gather more and more of your hard earned money

[16-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Caglio#3337
Now, there are some people that dont mind being lied to, or even played for a fools

[16-Aug-19 12:28 PM] Caglio#3337
There are some people that are exactly the opposite

[16-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
I am pretty sure this friday ends up with no goldman sachs representative announcing that

[16-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
maybe if they pay for an actor

[16-Aug-19 12:29 PM] Caglio#3337
so they unload more

[16-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Caglio#3337
but I think it ends up: all your questions are gonna be answered in the future

[16-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Caglio#3337
buying them more time

[16-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Caglio#3337
maybe the whole team isnt the scam

[16-Aug-19 12:30 PM] Caglio#3337
But some of them are

[16-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
And as @Markus is saying.... about fatfingering nerd team member.....

[16-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
After such a funding, you wouldnt need to do shit like this

[16-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
They are not allowed to tell this or that

[16-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Caglio#3337
But they are allowed to sell coins on exchange ?

[16-Aug-19 12:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I cant believe i am saying this but we go back to talking about how we are going to 0? I dont see how much value talking about this over and over again would bring. Let's just wait to see how the cards play out.

[16-Aug-19 12:49 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
@Caglio lol you gonna send some croatian mobsters after them if it's a scam ?

[16-Aug-19 12:50 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

I am not used to those morons driving around me

[16-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Caglio#3337
So if I was intoxicated with booze, I would probably beat someone up

[16-Aug-19 12:55 PM] Caglio#3337
