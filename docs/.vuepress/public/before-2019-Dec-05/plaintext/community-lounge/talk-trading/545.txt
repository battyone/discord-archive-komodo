For Pirate, I am concerned that in about 5 years, the mining rewards will become too small and we wont have much hashrate left at all to protect the network.  Has anybody discussed a tail emission?

[14-Apr-19 07:08 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
why does it need "a lot" of hashrate?

[14-Apr-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
all it needs is enough to move the chain

well said unicorn

[14-Apr-19 07:13 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not an issue when ARRR is 1k each and tx fees alone pay for mining costs.

[14-Apr-19 07:14 PM] Alexfrog#1338
We dont want to have hashrate so low that its just a few computers running it, because the reward is a fraction of one coin.  Then its basically free to just keep up a 51% attack in perpetuity.    DPoW will tell us this is happening, yes, but if it just goes on forever its a problem.

[14-Apr-19 07:15 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Yes, IF transaction fees can cover the cost then its fine, but that puts a clock on when the coin needs to have wide adoption by

[14-Apr-19 07:15 PM] jl777c#5810
well if it is a real problem, we have some years to solve it. it seems 5 years is quite a long time away

[14-Apr-19 07:16 PM] jl777c#5810
one simple idea is to make PIRATE 100% notary mined

[14-Apr-19 07:16 PM] Alexfrog#1338
then wouldnt it become like DPoS, and you just need to corrupt 51% of notaries?

[14-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
not with math internals, I believe 51% doesnt apply here

[14-Apr-19 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
but better or worse percentage

[14-Apr-19 07:19 PM] jl777c#5810
if the concern is there is no hashrate, then the tradeoff is that relying on notary mining is more secure than no hashrate

[14-Apr-19 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
also may depend how rogueplayers would operate

[14-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it cant go to PoS

[14-Apr-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if it has high enough value, then it could start notarizing every block

[14-Apr-19 07:21 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
`you just need to corrupt 51% of notaries?`
let me know when you figure out who those 34 people are.....

[14-Apr-19 07:21 PM] jl777c#5810
then sustaining a permanent 51% attack requires more like 99% hashrate, forever

[14-Apr-19 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe notarywize you don t need a 51%

[14-Apr-19 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
simulating this scenario on testnet would be awesome

[14-Apr-19 07:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why would low hash rate make it vulnerable to 51% if it has dpow?

[14-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
lol, a full mined by notaries unattackable chain üòç, mix that with pos for external player then immune pow and pos protected by dpow xD

[14-Apr-19 07:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Do you understand the purpose of a 51% attack?

[14-Apr-19 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You can have a miner mining 100% of a chain and not do a 51% attack

[14-Apr-19 07:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The purpose of the attack is to rewind the chain so that payments get deleted.

[14-Apr-19 07:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
But with dpow, you can have one person mining 100% and yet 51% would be difficult.

[14-Apr-19 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
(to allow like 1% mining to pow and the rest to stakers)

[14-Apr-19 07:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362

that may be just a dream, but seeing how "eth is not possible atm" to "ok it works, it s called ETOMIC", maybe the *can t* can be changed to *could*

maybe just a matter of time

[14-Apr-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there is plenty of time to solve the upcoming problem in 5 years about PIRATE reward getting too low

[14-Apr-19 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
already I can think of several ways to solve it

if there is a permanent censor attack going then this is a permanent cost to the attacker without any gain. In that case, then the "txfee" would be the cost to rent enough has to mine a block with the pending tx. just one honest block can be mining the mempool tx

[14-Apr-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so a 100% censorshipt attack would be inordinately expensive and without a profit motive, unsustainable

[14-Apr-19 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are to be worried about uneconomic attacks, then there is always the "kill the internet" attack. but i dont spend much time worrying about such things

Could always look at Chips on what happens when mining rewards are extremely low. Someone has to take one for the team.

[14-Apr-19 08:07 PM] ComputerGenie üë¥üèºüì¢#7004
there's a little more involved in the CHIPS example.....

[14-Apr-19 08:09 PM] SHossain#0007
CHIPS is being mined constantly. except there was about 9 hours down-time in mining recently due to internet cutoff in my whole area

since its otc it should be a % higher than spot price.

what is lots?

[14-Apr-19 10:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
`lot (l≈èt)‚ñ∫
n.    Informal A large extent, amount, or number. Often used in the plural: is in a lot of trouble; has lots of friends.`

[14-Apr-19 10:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
also synonym to `batch` (depending on context)

[14-Apr-19 10:21 PM] dokrates#8987
why anyone would buy here, when you can buy in binance

[14-Apr-19 10:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
because in here there's no kyüêî

[14-Apr-19 10:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
also because you would have one price for all of it.  You throw a wall up on binance, maybe it doesnt get filled.  Or you market buy and have a bit of an accounting headache with a bunch of different transactions at many different satoshi levels.

[14-Apr-19 10:25 PM] dokrates#8987
but here nobody will offer you a price better than binance

[14-Apr-19 10:26 PM] dokrates#8987
and also you must trust the buyer

[14-Apr-19 10:26 PM] dokrates#8987
i only think it work in case the guy haven't a binance account

[14-Apr-19 10:35 PM] klein#5233
Thats not necessarily true

[14-Apr-19 10:38 PM] klein#5233
If done on the dex

[14-Apr-19 10:41 PM] klein#5233
Possible to do large trade without slippage

[14-Apr-19 10:46 PM] klein#5233
To me that sounds an awesome use case for baterdex is effectively trustless OTC transactions

It'll probably still be too slow/impractical to do everyday trading on, but perfect for OTC trades

imagine taxes per transaction as a worry

[15-Apr-19 03:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PTYX  there are some major issues with local currency systems.

[15-Apr-19 03:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Taxes are one , as they are due in the legal tender currency,  the other is devaluation.  Currency in circulation can‚Äôt leave quickly due to the limited ability of the local community( and more specifically those who take part in the program )  to supply enough  goods/services to clear the money

[15-Apr-19 04:01 AM] PTYX#6840
yeah i just thought it was interesting. i'm sure it comes with problems

[15-Apr-19 04:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
They do apply. Barter is taxable in the US and most other countries. You control the emission but you don‚Äôt control the ‚Äúreflux‚Äù. The rate which currency in circulation returns to the issuer.  This is important because in these types of systems the currency is ‚Äúcredit‚Äù  which has a corresponding ‚Äúdebt‚Äù. if there is too much in circulation,  merchants will want more than face value because their need of the local currency is less.  As they have accumulated much and have had little to spend it on.  I‚Äôve seen this with many barter exchange systems.

[15-Apr-19 04:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Most countries have a form of money

[15-Apr-19 04:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you had something worth 10 dollars and traded for something worth 20.  The difference is capital gains.  Direct barter is hard to track,  just like a lot of things you are supposed to report it but many don‚Äôt.  In a centrally run operation where there is a 3rd party responsible for the record keeping typically they report it.    You may be in an area without capital gains tax or where barter is exempt,  I know though it is regulated by most countries though ,  they have their own lobby and everything,  IRTA
