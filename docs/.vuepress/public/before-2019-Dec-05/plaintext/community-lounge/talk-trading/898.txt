[06-Jul-19 12:26 PM] Mark81#4505
Jl777 is doing his best to keep price down. 1/tech = kmd price

[06-Jul-19 12:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
i sacrificed some kmd at 14k to buy pirate, now no pirate and less kmd üòÑ

[06-Jul-19 12:26 PM] Caglio#3337
which is still 6 k less than 2 weeks ago

[06-Jul-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Caglio which alt isnt?

[06-Jul-19 12:27 PM] Caglio#3337
DOGE

[06-Jul-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure KMD btc price is higher than last time dominance was this high

[06-Jul-19 12:27 PM] hyperDEX#6586
1/3000 ok

[06-Jul-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
when the dominance starts finally dropping, that is when the price will really start going up

[06-Jul-19 12:28 PM] Caglio#3337
Here, I am giving away 10 doge coins

[06-Jul-19 12:34 PM] yorklab#7270
With the professional investment sites coming on line soon, dominance may not fall. It will be an uphill battle for the Alts.

But as others have stated, perhaps BTC and KMD go up together.

[06-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Markus#5464
i think this is temporarily, ppl are hyped over the rebrand

[06-Jul-19 12:36 PM] yorklab#7270
For now hype, but then (hopefully) comes usage.

[06-Jul-19 12:36 PM] Markus#5464
Well yes

[06-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Andersen#8337
Yes  seems  noobs  hyped rebrand  news ,  and  smart money  buy  dex  news .    Both reason.

[06-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Markus#5464
think it will reach 20-25k and then have a correction cause by then it will be heavily overbought

Somebody actually bought some decent amount of KMD and took it off the market. Not just bot volume... at least thats my guess

People have been pitching crypto tokens as ownership representation since 2014. Still doesn't make any sense in 2019

Looks like someone trying to get alt season up and running.
