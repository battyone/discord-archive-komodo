This story by @campuscodi is absolutely mental. The company learned of a vulnerability in a third party library, then hacked their own users and took their cryptocurrency for safe keeping before real hackers could. Legal? Ethical? Where's the line? https://t.co/DgE3OF1mnV

i sent some kmd to bittrex 15 minutes before they disable kmd trading & deposit...  on blockchain i can see that  it confirmed, but i did not receive it in bittrex. just show me Pending Deposits 0/30

[08-Jun-19 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
likely they stopped processing deposits, so it will "arrive" when things reopen

Most projects would have crumbled based off of what happened. The entire execution and process was very well thought-out. I'm sorry there are still users/3rd parties that think things would have been better had the hacker swept the funds. Other projects would look at a potential rollback, whereas KMD can continue to have a solid ledger.

[08-Jun-19 05:23 PM] Alecandro#1179
Yea this is a huge win in light of the circumstances

[08-Jun-19 05:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Their pet shitbox projects would have a better chance without KMD drinking their milkshakes

oth Mark Karpeles seems to have benefited from his stint in the japanese prison system - lost a lot of weight, does not have to look over his shoulder any more, might even get a real girlfriend with his new good looks instead of a cat ...

I hope he does get caught,  will be filling up some commissaries to take care of the problem
