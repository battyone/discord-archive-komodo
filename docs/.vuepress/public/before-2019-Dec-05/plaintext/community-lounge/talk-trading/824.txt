funny guy

[22-Jun-19 09:23 PM] allbits#5898
Yes you were.When taking about your successful few months day trading with jl

[22-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Markus#5464
it was not bragging it was just saying that not everyone have to be a loser in the market

[22-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Markus#5464
but u seem offended so maybe ur one of the losers, anyway not gonna make a beef in this channel for no reason

[22-Jun-19 09:25 PM] allbits#5898
Of course that's true. Read "Fooled by Randomness". Sometime has to win. Or check out the wiki page for it. You'll learn something

[22-Jun-19 09:26 PM] allbits#5898
I'm put off by your repeated restatement of a theory for which you have no evidence, and claiming it here as undeniable fact

[22-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Markus#5464
well obviously i cant proof it to 100% if its backed or not not like i have access to their records

[22-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Markus#5464
but if they just 2 months ago admitted its not fully backed

[22-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Markus#5464
why should i belive that it is now

[22-Jun-19 09:27 PM] Markus#5464
in the end its my opinion, u can have urs

[22-Jun-19 09:30 PM] allbits#5898
It was fully backed at all times. But 25% of the backing was securitized due to a theft suffered by a related company. They then did a private placement of $1'billion to replace that security.

But you don't care about trying to educate yourself regarding details and context. Just shallow "knowledge" and then run around like you're the expert in it

[22-Jun-19 09:31 PM] allbits#5898
Your "opinions" are fact free claims stated categorically as fact, repeatedly, until I come here and challenge you on it

[22-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Markus#5464
the whole point of the discussion in the first place was not even if its backed or not but from what i can see i share my opinion regarding tether not being fully backed with others here

[22-Jun-19 09:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@allbits  sounding like CG :troll:

[22-Jun-19 09:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Tether were missing 800M, they got 1B in extra funding, which if 80% funded = 800m üòõ

[22-Jun-19 09:35 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So they should be back to fully backed status i hope

[22-Jun-19 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But in saying that, no one knows for sure. They could move all funds today if they wanted to.

[22-Jun-19 09:36 PM] allbits#5898
Your opinions are hard on internet myths. They may turn out to be right but most likely not. You guys talk about bitfinex and tether like they are startup nobodies. They are very sophisticated players in this business

[22-Jun-19 09:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So was backed does not mean backed at any moment of the day

[22-Jun-19 09:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@allbits they are also very shady

[22-Jun-19 09:37 PM] Markus#5464
they may not be new players in the market but definitely not having clean hands, but what can u expect from a market without regulations

[22-Jun-19 09:38 PM] Markus#5464
but even if there was regulations do it rly matter? check all real banks how they launder dirty money

[22-Jun-19 09:39 PM] allbits#5898
You say they're shady because the internet says they're shady. The internet also says jl777 is shady. We know that he's definitely not.

[22-Jun-19 09:39 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am saying they are shady because they did insider trading when iota was listed

[22-Jun-19 09:40 PM] Markus#5464
not to mention those previous "maintenance" bitcoin pumps

[22-Jun-19 09:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is not something a company making 300M needs to do

[22-Jun-19 09:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
At the end of the day, none of us will know what is and isnt happening with bitfinex or tether

[22-Jun-19 09:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So trying to defend any position is a waste of everyone's time as there is always the other side making the same

[22-Jun-19 09:41 PM] allbits#5898
The iota story is not so cut and dried as you just stated it. More internet myths

[22-Jun-19 09:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you have first/second hand exp with it?

[22-Jun-19 09:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyway no one can prove 1 way or the other, lets just hope that they survive until the end of this bull run

[22-Jun-19 09:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
By then we should all be rich and not care about this lol

[22-Jun-19 09:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
the bitfinex dudes admin a group called crypto coin trader on fb. any disparaging of bitfinex or tether earns you an instant ban.

[22-Jun-19 09:45 PM] allbits#5898
Hyperdex I have great respect for you. Just tiring watching these evidence free myths get continually passed off as gospel facts. Tether may crumble, you are correct. We can't know. The market is speaking tho ... it says fully backed.

[22-Jun-19 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@allbits All good. I agree at the moment, since the DOJ basically said they were missing 800M, now that they got 1B we should hope that means they are in full reserves. This is not taking into account their BTC holdings they have supposedly bought with their reserve funds but could be balanced on alt losses if they were dumb enough to get exposure to that too

[22-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Tek#5253
i trust tether more than banks

[22-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Tek#5253
but if i was gonna hold a stable coin i'd hold TrueUSD

[22-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Tek#5253
or i'd get DGX tokens instead

[22-Jun-19 09:49 PM] Tek#5253
they equal a gram of gold

[22-Jun-19 09:50 PM] allbits#5898
I'd get pondsea silver!

[22-Jun-19 09:50 PM] hyperDEX#6586
üòõ I have been thinking of doing something special for that üòÉ

[22-Jun-19 09:50 PM] Tek#5253
so whatsup bois

[22-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Tek#5253
the verus agama is much better than the real agama

[22-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Tek#5253

[22-Jun-19 09:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Agama will be back

[22-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Tek#5253
also came in appimage format

[22-Jun-19 09:51 PM] Tek#5253
very easy

[22-Jun-19 09:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
fuck bitfinex and tether. those dipshits got kicked out of the us for their scam bullshit. if i ever see the fuckface fb admin in real life i will beat his spindly armed little ass.

[22-Jun-19 09:52 PM] Tek#5253
lmao

[22-Jun-19 09:53 PM] Tek#5253
I went to the city and pasted BCH stickers I got from that dude that bought BCH from me in a P2P no kyc escrow trade

[22-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Tek#5253
lmao I put one sticker near the place people need to go to collect benifits / get their benifits in order

[22-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Tek#5253
also at a bus station

[22-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Tek#5253
I almost put one at a police station too

[22-Jun-19 09:54 PM] Tek#5253

[22-Jun-19 10:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
anyone who profits from leading crypto lambs to the slaughter deserves no mercy. i apologize for my empty threats.

[22-Jun-19 10:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyone that trades on any exchange or bitmex is taking a big risk that they are not counter trading you. They dont need to do it 100% of the time but enough to make millions

[22-Jun-19 10:58 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Why do people not know?

[22-Jun-19 10:59 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Keep up the good work

[22-Jun-19 11:00 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
I'll just guess...

[22-Jun-19 11:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just a matter of time

[22-Jun-19 11:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just look at dash, why does it work well? Because the community is out there promoting obsolete tech

[22-Jun-19 11:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont see that sort of community mobilization, everyone seems to be waiting around for marketing team to do some marketing

[22-Jun-19 11:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If we work on the basis that they wont do it, shouldnt we, as the community not try to help our own investments?

[22-Jun-19 11:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I have seen in the past many complain that the marketing team is not doing much well how many complain that they have sat on their hands for years hoping the price will rise?

[22-Jun-19 11:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If you want the price to rise and get people using and talking about Komodo, get off your virtual asses and pound that keyboard with vigor

[22-Jun-19 11:04 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Or for you rich whales out there, fund for devs, create solutions for the ecosystem, fund community marketing efforts.

[22-Jun-19 11:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It really does go back to, ask not of what the KMD marketing team can do for you, but what you can to make KMD price in sats rise.

I'm not mad....just curious....my IQ must be low....this place is bad ass

[22-Jun-19 11:07 PM] wolfgang#3508
@kmdkrazy   no ones saying anything against the community

[22-Jun-19 11:10 PM] Markus#5464
is kmd marketing rly that bad tho? it feels like word is getting spread, i often see kmd team attending crypto events to speak about komodo and ecosystems working hard to showcase that the tech actually work or how it can be used

[22-Jun-19 11:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
It should be top 10 or top 4

[22-Jun-19 11:11 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
This is an amazing thing to see

[22-Jun-19 11:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There has been some mis- steps but if we work on the assumption they wont be able to make a impact, we as a community can do what we can to help with that and when the marketing team does have a impact that should be reflected much more in the price

[22-Jun-19 11:13 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Relying on someone to do something, means we take a back seat. The community needs to help in this effort and a failure in marketing of Komodo is not just a failure of the marketing team, it is also a failure of the community.

[22-Jun-19 11:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Marketing = Marketing team + Community

[22-Jun-19 11:14 PM] Grisu#3373
A Great Product Needs No Advertising^^^

[22-Jun-19 11:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is marketed by the users and community

[22-Jun-19 11:15 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
The program should speak for itself user

[22-Jun-19 11:15 PM] Markus#5464
I dont know if komodo can be compared to other projects with incredible marketing, they have funds to spend on marketing but i sometimes feel like kmd do not want to spend money on marketing. Also understandable since the ico money was meant for something else. Just saying, money do impact aswell

[22-Jun-19 11:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes but there is too much noise and misinformation out there. There needs to be some marketing, but as @Markus said we dont have millions for that.

[22-Jun-19 11:16 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Then fork it!

[22-Jun-19 11:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So how do you out compete a ICO with millions, you do it through great tech/product and you get the community to help market it

[22-Jun-19 11:16 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is not an option

[22-Jun-19 11:17 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
There are always options
