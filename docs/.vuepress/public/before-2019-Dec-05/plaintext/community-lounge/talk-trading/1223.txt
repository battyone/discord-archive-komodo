Is there a link to a compilation of material on how to use MM?

wtf happened on binance?

[03-Dec-19 07:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone just misclicked for 200BTC?

[03-Dec-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it was spread out over 30 minutes or so

[03-Dec-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
wasnt a single fat finger. seems someone wanted to accumulate a lot of KMD at a slight premium to current price

[03-Dec-19 07:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
30% isnt your typical slippage üòõ

[03-Dec-19 07:32 AM] LocoMB#8593
nice to see such candles!

[03-Dec-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
for 200 BTC it is

[03-Dec-19 07:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
True

[03-Dec-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly for a small 1 BTC order you can get much smaller slippage

[03-Dec-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but only so much KMD is for sale at current prices

[03-Dec-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh yes, but you could also achieve the same thing when exchange reopens

[03-Dec-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
without that slippage

[03-Dec-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
how so?

[03-Dec-19 07:33 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The built up sell pressure that will be there once it reopens

[03-Dec-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
there is this myth that there are millions of KMD waiting to be sold

[03-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but all along 10 million KMD sitting on binance

[03-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and the big volume traders, keep the coins on exchange

[03-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly the organic sales amounts will create some sell pressure

[03-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but there are those waiting for exchange wallets to open before buying, it is unclear which side is bigger

[03-Dec-19 07:34 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think we have averaged about 20-30BTC of volume on binance

[03-Dec-19 07:35 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So even smaller amounts of KMD being sold, can move the market.

[03-Dec-19 07:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I guess it works both ways, people could be waiting for wallets to open to buy on the dump, there are also people waiting for the wallets to open to dump

[03-Dec-19 07:36 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So it could go up or down üòÑ

[03-Dec-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it is 100% definitely clear that it is unclear

[03-Dec-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the only way to know is to watch and see what happens

[03-Dec-19 07:38 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there anyway to track the mm2.0 volume these days?

[03-Dec-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
only test volumes

[03-Dec-19 07:41 AM] hyperDEX#6586
seems like there were a few alts that got a pump roughly around the same time on binance

very disappointing that binance wallet is in maintenance mode for weeks

[03-Dec-19 10:20 AM] Markus#5464
so whales can manipulate the market on it without ppl having a chance to follow up

[03-Dec-19 10:22 AM] freakbros#9074
And bittrex was open the hole time and never missed a beat

it appears that way, spread over almost an hour, so not a fat finger

[03-Dec-19 11:24 AM] Flint#6435
and simple manipulators with their personal goals and schemes that none of us foresee for sure

[03-Dec-19 11:26 AM] Flint#6435
someone wants hamsters to believe in the native, although the trading volume is so low that accompanies the price that talking about the moon is simply stupid! these are manipulator games! when the trading volume will be at least 10-20 million dollars, then it will be possible to dream that good buyers have come

[03-Dec-19 11:43 AM] richardt#2807
Even BTC is manipulated on a regular basis, let alone a small coin like KMD

[03-Dec-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if KMD is trading 20% of its marketcap per day, that would indicate a lot of artificial volumes, or massive usage of atomicDEX with KMD pairs to arbitrage

[03-Dec-19 11:49 AM] Markus#5464
i blame Tether for btc manipulation, i think its hard to deny that they didnt affect btc price in abnormal way

Crypto trading would not be near where it is today without tether

[03-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Tether is part of the game, deal with it. Manipulation is part of the game, deal with it.

[03-Dec-19 01:13 PM] Bitfinger#6245
And stop this crypto vs. crypto bs it's boring. Divide and conquer has the crypto community shattered into little squabbling camps... the real enemy is fiat, don't forget it

[03-Dec-19 01:21 PM] ronyi#5719
Sorry, i hate the enemy word. I think fiat is not enemy. Fiat is part of the game deal with it. I was here before tether and I'll be here. üôÇ

was a nice pump to watch last night.... to bad it didn't hold up at 13k sats

[03-Dec-19 04:52 PM] richardt#2807
@Bitfinger Decentralized or not, humans will always be humans

[03-Dec-19 04:54 PM] richardt#2807
That's what 11 yrs of crypto have taught us

[03-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Yep, exactly that  @richardt, but not only crypto, most things are manipulated, it's the way of the world.

[03-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Markus#5464
back to prepump price üò¨

[03-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Smedley#8094
While I understand that the Komodo team was being proactive in informing the exchanges about the update, 3-4 weeks with no deposits or withdrawals is absurd and should have been prevented. Especially when Komodo is always talking about exchanges that stole users funds yet they were responsible for locking users funds on a centralized exchange for 3-4 weeks.

[03-Dec-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its an exchange decision

[03-Dec-19 05:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Plenty exchanges with open wallets

[03-Dec-19 05:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not saying its not annoying, just saying that if you want to sell there are options

[03-Dec-19 05:58 PM] phm87#7395
Bittrex have good liquidity as example and deposits and withdrawals were open

[03-Dec-19 05:58 PM] actionslacks#4072
binance does hold an alarming amount of the crypto trading pie.

[03-Dec-19 05:59 PM] phm87#7395
bitmex is bigger than binance and I think that coinbase is more rich than binance

[03-Dec-19 06:05 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
BTC wise but I think Binance holds the most Alts

[03-Dec-19 06:08 PM] Neko#5830
most liquidity

[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Neko#5830
the question is why someone wanted a lot of kmd for an above current market price

[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just saw Graviex is incentivizing  coins that were on CB to come get listed in under 24 hours

[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@Neko could be anything, for example: coins getting a USDT pair on Binance were getting lots of volume BEFORE announcement in the past.  A USDT pair on Binance would be long due to be honest if look at some  coins that already have one.

pretty ugly daily candle

[03-Dec-19 07:47 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Still 4hrs to go, let's see if it can keep the momentum

[03-Dec-19 09:14 PM] Flint#6435
in spite of all the manipulations, it seems that we have already groped the bottom and left it behind! it‚Äôs true that there is a chance to feel it again if Bitcoin returns to 4000 and a panic sale begins - but personally I will perceive it as an excellent entry point because paired with Bitcoin everything looks reasonable and promising, even taking into account all the corrections that will follow the pumps

[03-Dec-19 09:16 PM] Flint#6435
the conclusion is open and there is no mass drain yet and probably will not, but some mass of coins will still move from external sources against the background of this news - the question is which wayü§î

What do you all think of Komodo?
What do you all think of Komodo?

[04-Dec-19 05:18 AM] tolken#2655
‚ÄúThus rented 50+% hashrate attacks will become trivially easy against all altcoins not just the numerous weaker ones which have already been 50+% attacked.

The cost of Komodo‚Äôs Delayed Proof-of-work (dPoW) might become prohibitive.

I feel bad about that, because the idea for dPoW originated from me in private discussions with @jl777, although I always thought it to be only a stopgap measure while researching for a better solution.‚Äù

^^^ excerpt from article @Don King posted above.

[04-Dec-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we already raised the funds needed to do notarizations for 10+ years. it might become expensive, but we had the BTC legacy to do it. we dont use segwit

[04-Dec-19 06:37 AM] hastrup#8742
@actionslacks I like how the last poster calls komodo a "shitcoin" and promoting a online casino at the same time XD

[04-Dec-19 06:41 AM] Alright#0419
```
Is it Bitcoin?
Is its symbol XMR?

If you answered no to the above questions, then it's a shitcoin. You can use this template to determine the legitimacy of any other altcoin on the market, too.
```
heh, I like this guy

[04-Dec-19 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
back then, that was exactly how I felt

[04-Dec-19 06:54 AM] hastrup#8742
@Don King what is the difference between btc core and btc legacy he/she keeps taking about core will fail and legacy will survive or am I missing something?

[04-Dec-19 07:27 AM] tolken#2655
@hastrup figured he was referring to bitcoin cash

[04-Dec-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
he is talking about BTC before segwit and after

[04-Dec-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
segwit addresses that start with 3 are encoded in the blockchain as an anyonecan spend output

[04-Dec-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that sounds as bad as it is as anybody could spend. the only thing stopping it is the miners are all running a soft fork and interpret signature data that is separated out

[04-Dec-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
as more and more funds accumulate in the anyone can spend addresses, the temptation to do exactly that will increase. there is no need to go back to when segwit activated, the miners can do this at anytime.

[04-Dec-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
of course it will create a chain split  but if the vast majority of mining hashrate is mining the pre-segwit bitcoin, there wont be any space in the segwit bitcoin to process the transactions, especially as its blocktime increases.

[04-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
there will likely be a large battle around this and we will most likely end up with two chains, the current chain with segwit addresses intact and the non-segwit chain where the anyone can spends are sorted by value in each block. but if that was the case, that chain wont be processing normal tx either.

[04-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
basically a big giant mess will ensue

[04-Dec-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and this would start off the biggest altseason ever seen

[04-Dec-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
last one was when BTC was crippled due to mempool backlog and txfee craziness. if BTC splits into such factions, people will scramble to go to altcoins.

[04-Dec-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are worried about the anyone can spend, just dont keep your funds in a segwit address starting with 3, addresses starting with 1 are safe

[04-Dec-19 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so would multisig addresses that start with 3, a bit confusing

[04-Dec-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
personally, i think the odds of such an anyonecan spendcopalypse is pretty low, yet i dont have any BTC in segwit addresses. i never liked segwit

[04-Dec-19 07:53 AM] hastrup#8742
Thx for the clarification! How likely do you think "the giant mess" will happen?
