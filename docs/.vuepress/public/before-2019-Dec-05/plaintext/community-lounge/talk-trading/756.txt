plz post if you received your refund properly

[09-Jun-19 09:51 AM] barv#0867
Yep. I got one in 👍

[09-Jun-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
half the claim forms are missing the transfer of dust from old address to new address. make sure to do that and i can run the refund processor to issue the refund

[09-Jun-19 10:24 AM] mobipoi#5774
Does this work only for kmd ? Or other kmd  assets too

[09-Jun-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the same process will be used for assetchains, but after the bulk of KMD is processed. it just takes a long time to get things setup to get ready, but now that the refund processor is coded, it is a matter to send out the dust and run the refunds after the node is setup for the particular assetchain

[09-Jun-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i am working as fast as i can and will post status as it happens

[09-Jun-19 10:27 AM] mobipoi#5774
Ok

[09-Jun-19 10:27 AM] mobipoi#5774
Nice work

[09-Jun-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i am happy with these 500 lines of C code!

[09-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to be clear, if your address had less than 777 KMD swept, and you didnt receive a refund, but you received the dust to the old address. the holdup for the refund is the transaction you need to send from the old address to the new address: 

https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

I will run the refund processor daily for a while, so if you dont get your tx done before i start the refund processor, you will need to wait another day. Also if you have a larger amount, we need to wait a bit more time to make sure there are no disputes. and if your funds were not swept, but stolen, you need to wait and additional week.

it does take a long time to run the refund processor as i didnt code it for efficiency. i will process progressively larger and larger amounts during the week and will post the most recent cutoff value. that way you dont have to keep asking when your refund will be processed. until you send in your dust tx from old address to new address and i process refunds bigger than your refund, your refund wont be processed.

do those sites write their own stories or should we co-create one to send out? or is the marketing team already on that?

[09-Jun-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the press we got was unsolicited. it seemed to then get copy pasted by many other press outfits

A friend of mine wanted me to put money in a ponzi i convinced her to buy komodo

[09-Jun-19 12:59 PM] criptobear#6402
Only problem she is not so techy

[09-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
bitpanda you can deposit with mastercard/visa/... and buy kmd directly

[09-Jun-19 12:59 PM] modereck#4269
@criptobear  tyou can use bitpanda

[09-Jun-19 01:00 PM] criptobear#6402
I will check

[09-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
as easy as coinbase

[09-Jun-19 01:00 PM] criptobear#6402

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] criptobear#6402
But it needs registration

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] criptobear#6402

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah that is the downside

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think there are atm's where you can buy kmd with mastercard in austria

[09-Jun-19 01:01 PM] criptobear#6402

[09-Jun-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
about 20% have received refunds, but weighed to the smaller ones so only about $1 mil worth is returned. we are ahead of the June 15th schedule by almost a week. for those that did not receive refunds yet, make sure to follow the instructions. any address with any controversy has not been processed yet. i see a lot of people made many claims for the same address and that triggered a disputed flag, ie. delayed
all clean refunds for less than 7777 KMD has been processed
there will be daily batches
make sure the dust payment sent to your old address has 'S' in the explorer for your old address. if not, that means you did not send it to the new address. send all funds to the new address to solve this
if you did not get the early refund, that means you missed the cutoff yesterday, or made multiple claims or your address is contested or it is over 7777 KMD
plz do not be making DM asking about these things. it is always the same answer.
