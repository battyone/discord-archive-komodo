I wouldnt be surprised to see the opposite

[22-Sep-19 09:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There‚Äôs no one left

Long timers are beginning to fade away

[22-Sep-19 09:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This is the doldrums

[22-Sep-19 10:24 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the KMD hacker has written automatic script to auto transfer any amount sent to hacked address to new address. Be careful

[22-Sep-19 10:27 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I was trying to proof the ownership of hacked address per @MadMaX  instruction and got screwed

[22-Sep-19 10:27 PM] Markus#5464
if ppl didnt update until now then they probably shouldnt even use crypto since they dont bother caring to update to latest version

[22-Sep-19 10:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
not about the agama, but about the hacked address

[23-Sep-19 12:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's like the 2016 slump all over again. only now it's 20x the mktcap

[23-Sep-19 03:18 AM] richardt#2807
@meatspoon I agree.  Less buzzwords, technical jargon, and bold claims would be nice.  Many projects do suffer from this

I agree that there are some details to attend to as far as the documentation. explaining complicated things in a simple way is no easy feat however. how often do you try to explain btc to people? It's hard to get the msg accross with even the basics. This is an open project. anyone can contribute more than just opinions if they so wish. bakkt up to 10btc volume https://www.bakkt.com/index

The majority of people who use a computer (or a smartphone) have no idea how it actually works, but those people still know what they can do with it and have a desire to use it.  The same thing needs to eventually happen with blockchain tech

[23-Sep-19 08:18 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Gordon Komodo make sure it‚Äôs not @jl777c doing the auto sweeping

[23-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's not jl777c's address because the fund is being moved to new address  every new block

[23-Sep-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no more sweeping. hacker autosteals any funds deposited to the compromised addresses

Unpopular opinion: what we see in Bakkt  is the real volume throughout the market.  Then the scale of volume falsification in spot markets is impressive

[23-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Andersen#8337

I asked my bank for 30K Loan

[23-Sep-19 02:38 PM] JimD#9272
They said yes but at 10% interest

[23-Sep-19 02:38 PM] JimD#9272
what a bunch of bastards

[23-Sep-19 02:38 PM] JimD#9272
comes out to almost 8K in interest

[23-Sep-19 02:39 PM] hastrup#8742
in denmark they pay you for that kind of loean XD

[23-Sep-19 02:40 PM] dan.#2473
neg rates will end badly lol

[23-Sep-19 02:40 PM] JimD#9272
haha, I need to find a new bank I think

[23-Sep-19 02:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
I really wish all the 4chan psy-ops could remain coomtained in that egregore of shit

[23-Sep-19 02:46 PM] hastrup#8742
lol

[23-Sep-19 02:48 PM] JimD#9272
Im starting to believe everything in this world is some kind of psy-op.  Those who can convince the plebs they are right rise to power.  Thats why the equalist drivel is so popular to the masses.

[23-Sep-19 02:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
wtf 10% intrest @JimD

[23-Sep-19 02:51 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, I don't think Im gonna take it.  401K loan might be a stronger move since I pay the interest back to myself

[23-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
0,5% not really possible I think unless you pay 50% yourself

[23-Sep-19 02:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
:p

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
really?

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] JimD#9272
Ya,  Why can't I get access to the discount window

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
lowest I've heard here is 1,2% fix over 20y

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] JimD#9272
Print me some money up at 1.75% interest might fed

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hardly anything up front

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
only notary costs to be paid cash

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] hastrup#8742
its -0.75 over 10 y

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
everything else financed

[23-Sep-19 02:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
problem is that house prices rise in price because of low intrest rates

[23-Sep-19 02:53 PM] hastrup#8742
but it id not fix

[23-Sep-19 02:53 PM] JimD#9272
Yup, somewhat annoying when you start finding the invisible walls

[23-Sep-19 02:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so once intrest rates go up, the public is fucked as houseprices will plummet

[23-Sep-19 02:53 PM] JimD#9272
ya, I think house could be a good buy if you get it in a crash

[23-Sep-19 02:54 PM] JimD#9272
good luck actually having the cash and presence of mind to call that bottom though

[23-Sep-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I am thinking of selling my appartment tbh

[23-Sep-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I got an offer of 25% higher than what I paid 4 years ago

[23-Sep-19 02:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
which is retarded

[23-Sep-19 02:54 PM] hastrup#8742
do iut

[23-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I have an appartment with private entrance and 600m2 garden :p

[23-Sep-19 02:55 PM] JimD#9272
Id take that and plop the profits into BTC

[23-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362
so not really standard appt but still

[23-Sep-19 02:55 PM] hastrup#8742
