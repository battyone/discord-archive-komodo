Imagine building your great idea for a Dapp on a single chain project like $Neo then imagine there is no blocks for 8hrs and all your customers cannot use your dapp. Single chain scaling doesnt work. Get your own chain at @KomodoPlatform secured by #Dpow be as strong as $B...

would appear something is wrong with a number of nodes or something

[29-Jan-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
do they have more than 8 validator nodes yet?

[29-Jan-19 09:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe a false alarm RN, blocks are moving. but a shit ton of nodes are not up to date

just a chain split then

a good amount of connected peers to the outdated ones lol

[29-Jan-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
did they update the code or just a random chainsplit?

[29-Jan-19 09:09 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
No clue buddy

[29-Jan-19 09:11 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
weird cos a number of the block explorer's are behind massively. Could have been random chain split

Im just passing on info that's commented have no idea about it his "1 block out syncing the nodes" doesn't sound good though

NEO: this fork isn't a "fork" because it only forked the chain then stopped

Crazy that the bug does that and any project using the chain or lite wallet services is rekt

Yeah exactly lol

[29-Jan-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
that NEO thread is nothing like what happened to KMD. read the NEO article. it basically says that NEO does not have proper consensus code and they explain how it forked but somehow its ok that it did

Was interested to see if their deposits and withdraws stopped along with Neos, I expect they did

This is what happens when your project is tied 2 a main platform chain like $NEO $ETH etc,Today Neo had issues with syncing and the result was all project wallets be taken down for deposits and withdraws. Multi chain scaling solutions exist on $KMD un-effected by Kmd

It's come to my attention that tether is accounting for 2/3 of all transaction to this say into crypto

[29-Jan-19 03:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I honestly think we will go 1/3 from today's prices. Because without a doubt tether is insolvent and a scam which refuses to be audited. Hell they fired their auditing company.

[29-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Tek#5253
last thing I heard tether got audited

[29-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Tek#5253
and was legit

[29-Jan-19 03:43 PM] BlackJesus#6161
When was this?! Bitfinex let themselves be audited?

[29-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
it was an external auditor

[29-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Tek#5253
it happened a few months ago

i don't know any details all I put in my RAM is "tether was audited and is legit"
