It's probably a big reason why it's been so hard for KMD to get the message across

[21-Jul-19 12:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm a little concerned that apple/google are gonna shut it down before it can gain real usage.

the chinese government has the power to force the use of bit-yuan in china, while neglecting personal privacy. If bit-yuan are activated, tax evasion, counterfeiting and money laundering will become impossible. It is also feared to have side effects. the chinese government could impose economic disadvantages on minority supporters, those who have antipathy to the communist party and those who support democracy. It is much easier to trace if you use bit-yuan than when you use the yuan.

what will happen to bitcoin's fate? As the U.S.-China war will affect the blockchain ecosystem, bitcoin's neutrality will shine even more. neither the U.S. nor the chinese government can fully control bitcoin. whether the fed issues a "Fed coin" or the people's bank of china issues a bit-yuan, facebook issues a libra or whatever, it won't weaken the power of the bitcoin network.

the reason is that bitcoin is a network based on trust distributed without specific control actors. like the relationship between modern nominal currency and gold, bitcoin, called digital gold, should be considered as a key currency for various digital currencies.

It's a miscalculation to think that Libra threatens U.S. dollar hegemony. 
strengthen. by far the dollar will take the lion's share of libra's basket of legal currency. If libra is actively used, the U.S. can take control of the global digital currency ecosystem. the U.S., which controls the real world economy with dollars, will even try to dominate the digital world economy by controlling digital currency issued by Libra or its companies.

[21-Jul-19 07:46 AM] designer#4893
china can't just stand by and watch this way. the former governor of the Central Bank of China argued that China should develop its own digital currency to prepare for the Libra. In fact, the Central Bank of China has officially announced that it will issue a Central Bank Digital Currency. 

In my view, China is likely to issue a "bit-yuan" (tentative name) to lead the establishment of an international standard for digital currency much faster than other countries. while Libra is a digital currency issued by a private U.S. company, bit-yuan is issued by the Central Bank of China, which inevitably has a much stronger ripple effect.

the hour of privacy coins and DEX will come, and they will shine

[21-Jul-19 07:48 AM] designer#4893
Sadly, people will depend on the state.

[21-Jul-19 07:49 AM] designer#4893
process of privacy coin and dex to gain credibility will be a very rocky and long journey.

[21-Jul-19 07:52 AM] designer#4893
people prefer a system that relies on and can be held accountable to else rather than an independent.

[21-Jul-19 07:53 AM] designer#4893
because most human is weak.

[21-Jul-19 07:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@designer how will the Chinese government itself bypass these restrictions? There are party members with illicit gains that cant be moved too.

[21-Jul-19 08:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There will always be a way around it, just it may not be achievable by joe down the road.

Looks like it is missing lots of different projects, but still the ones listed is surprising especially for the few with hundreds of million in MC

[21-Jul-19 02:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
why give up 1400x in trades while waiting for a 200x "moon"?

[21-Jul-19 02:14 PM] Markus#5464
i doubt u do the trading urself

[21-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Markus#5464

[21-Jul-19 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I came to komodo slack looking for #tradebots

[21-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
what is ur strategys goal? more usd, btc or kmd?

[21-Jul-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
more buy power

[21-Jul-19 02:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the goal should be total net worth of a, b, *and* c; not just a, b, *or* c

[21-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
u still have to base it on one type

[21-Jul-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
or maybe u have a 33% balance of usd, btc and kmd

[21-Jul-19 02:20 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`u still have to base it on one type`
but you don't though, it's not a 0 sum game

[21-Jul-19 02:21 PM] Markus#5464

i think crypto is not rly as huge as ppl might think....pretty sure like 95% if not more of trading volume is from bots on a daily basis not just kmd but crypto overall

[21-Jul-19 02:59 PM] BoBot-BUY KMD#8821
yea for real.......

[21-Jul-19 02:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The fact that ETH is even in the top 100 backs that up

You think KMD is top 10 coin ?

[21-Jul-19 09:51 PM] joe2x4#5987
Cmc volume drying up, or cmc has no stats on Dex trades? If I was a whale I would take offense at all the plebs who expected to dump in my wake. So I'd make komodo dump to shake some coins out. Then I'd buy all their tears and sell back to them on pump
