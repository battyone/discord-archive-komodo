I would pay to get them listed on the DEX but I don’t own any BTC.

[24-Aug-19 10:04 PM] VengeanceWithout#4105
Interesting. If I can trade it for another currency I’ll do it.

I’d rather not say unless I know you are actually offering me a crypto. I can’t find it on any crypto sites or anything.

[24-Aug-19 10:13 PM] VengeanceWithout#4105
Trade it for BTC or any other crypto and send me a message and we’ll talk. I have no use for a coin I’ve never heard of.

$BTC truly is a volatile asset. In the past 2 years alone price went down by 80% only to go up by 300% again.

I am trying to be objective and open-minded about what can happen. I don't use log charts often and there's always one question at the back of my mind.

"What if?"

Lol, if BTC goes to 1k my whole paycheck every month is going in, I'm going to just be homeless for a while, quit paying my bills, and accumulate as much as possible

How long till he removes his buy wall

[26-Aug-19 01:16 AM] yorklab#7270
I suspect he actually want's to buy it at that price. He's patient, letting the sellers come to him.

[26-Aug-19 04:02 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Greedy

[26-Aug-19 04:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Remove it if you read this

[26-Aug-19 04:09 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
he sold 800K kmd in the past, so he just wanted to buy it back 😄

[26-Aug-19 05:03 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I mean he could remove this and buy in small chunks on the way down

[26-Aug-19 05:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
It could also be keeping it from going up by forcing the bots to keep dipping into that massive amount of liquidity just sitting there.

[26-Aug-19 05:19 AM] actionslacks#4072

@actionslacks moneyflow isn't showing any noteworthy buys tho

[26-Aug-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Also this amount probably never get filled

[26-Aug-19 07:27 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Why he wouldn't just buy this OTC

[26-Aug-19 07:28 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
I think he will pull it and dump it

Bch is the biggest scam ever

[26-Aug-19 09:42 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Nearly all transactions come from 2 wallets

[26-Aug-19 10:06 AM] LocoMB#8593
@mrtzmp3  got a link?
I think BullShitVersion is a scam, but so far I was not sure about BCH .. ofc it was mosntrously stupid of Roger Ver to get involved with CSW in the first place, but he seems to be trying to do build a good project. Also, I really like Ricks scathing analysis, and he seems to be associated with BCH too, and Rick is certainly no scammer - but that doesn't have to mean anything

[26-Aug-19 10:09 AM] Tek#5253
His sources are Bitcoin reddit

[26-Aug-19 10:09 AM] Tek#5253
he only reads BTC propaganda articles

[26-Aug-19 10:10 AM] Tek#5253
I use BCH everyday

Dont forget the pump and dump of BCH 2017, from less than 50$ to 4000$ in matter of days

[26-Aug-19 10:44 AM] Markus#5464
much hype

[26-Aug-19 10:45 AM] Markus#5464
and it was presented as the real bitcoin

[26-Aug-19 10:46 AM] Tek#5253
BCH is a better bitcoin

[26-Aug-19 10:46 AM] Tek#5253
Dash is a better bitcoin

In the end saying that BCH and Dash are better then bitcoin, well i dont think they have same visions
