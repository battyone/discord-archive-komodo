[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> the good thing is that this slow move down has pushed the monthly 20sma up

[19-Jun-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> already above $5k

[19-Jun-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> it was below $2k when the correction started

[19-Jun-18 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> a good thing would be that we get a capitulation to the monthly 20sma a pull back from it to get a longer term rally

[20-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362

people have paid in advance for all the airdrops that the $4 bill will fund

[20-Jun-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, the EOS team would never even think about paying themselves some giant salary, bonus, etc. for a job well done

[20-Jun-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
