you see 3 coins, one of which is BNB

[24-Apr-19 08:38 AM] jorian#4555
bonobo coin üòõ

[24-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is it a website or an app?

it is NXT AE, 5 years later?

[24-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so much wow

[24-Apr-19 08:40 AM] jorian#4555
well you can say a lot, but at least they have a DEX :abusedsmily:

[24-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
But it is night mode

[24-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Much better and advanced

[24-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Doesn‚Äôt use as much screen power

[24-Apr-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
probably even works over tor!

Now you‚Äôre scaring me

[24-Apr-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but its on a website... so i guess not quite as good as the NXT AE from 5 years ago

[24-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
So you‚Äôre logging into this thing?

[24-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Do you have your private keys?

[24-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
What exactly is dex about this dex?

[24-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Malti#3948
you 'log in' by either creating a wallet

[24-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Malti#3948
or giving a mnemonic seed + temporary password

[24-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Malti#3948
so basically you put your seed in a browser

[24-Apr-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
on the spectrum of centralized to decentralized, it seems it is about a 2 or 3, which is better than 1, but not by much

[24-Apr-19 08:46 AM] jorian#4555
the spectrum going from 1 - 100?

[24-Apr-19 08:47 AM] Malti#3948
i feel safer to deposit my funds on nance than to give my private key lol

[24-Apr-19 08:47 AM] klein#5233
yeah if anything this puts alot more risk into the  customers side

[24-Apr-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
of course make a new one

[24-Apr-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
presumably you need BNB to change any bid or ask

[24-Apr-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
traders love paying fee for every change!

[24-Apr-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
even if nothing is traded

[24-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and so maybe all trades will go on the BNB chain, so if people use it a lot, it will be a TB chain in 4.2 months

[24-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but you cant sync to it, so you need to use their SPV servers

Wen mm2.0

[24-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Malti#3948
so basically they're gonna centralize the whole thing through the BNB chain? @jl777c

[24-Apr-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
seems so

[24-Apr-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
NXT and bitshares, same thing

[24-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Malti#3948
but with the premises that it's "on a chain and thus decentralized"

[24-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it turns out traders dont like to pay for changing their bids and asks and cancels

[24-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
part of it is decentralized

[24-Apr-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is very far from real decentralization

[24-Apr-19 08:51 AM] klein#5233
wtf

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] klein#5233
yes paying to change orders is retarded

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is bnb still running on erc20?

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Malti#3948
no klein, I love it

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Malti#3948
lol

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Malti#3948
no

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
How many tx/s they running?

[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Malti#3948
@Cryptoon it was anounced that they're swapping by end of week

As BNB tokens are ‚Äúmigrated‚Äù to the new chain launched today, BNB itself probably no longer be complies with @binance‚Äôs own (unofficial) listing policy, as the node software isn‚Äôt open source, and they wouldn‚Äôt list other coins where source code isn‚Äôt available...

binance dex is coming guys

[24-Apr-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Apr-19 09:06 AM] klein#5233
someone should troll them and apply to list something thats closed source

[24-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Launch some transaction test nodes?

[24-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

A few guys seem to be bent out of shape, take it easy. Don‚Äôt call it a DEX. Call it an exchange where users control their own funds, runs on a fast blockchain maintained by a number of nodes, plus a fast and easy UI. That‚Äôs it.

[24-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Markus#5464

[24-Apr-19 10:21 AM] coingirl87#6489
Yeah....make no sense

[24-Apr-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
emotion driven trading is supposed to?

[24-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if you sell when BTC goes up and sell when BTC goes down again, you end up with across the board lower prices

[24-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c maybe the guy who said kmd will go to 10k was right after all? :troll_lol:

[24-Apr-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if BTC goes straight from here to 10K it could happen

[24-Apr-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
